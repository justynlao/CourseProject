"Malik Beasley is still surprising to me, maybe even more so than Grant, I know he did it last year, but I think with KAT back both he and DLo drop below 20, even if only barely so, I could see them both settling around 18"
Malik Beasley getting snubbed:  20.2/4.8/2.2 on .570 TS%
Anthony Edwards and Malik Beasley are going to be so good in the upcoming years. I never watch Timberwolves basketball and was thoroughly impressed how they played in both games

Both Edwards and Wiseman have been coming off the bench lately for Malik Beasley and Looney.

How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
Most pleasant is Malik Beasley. Unpleasant is Juancho.

THJ is currently the 2nd option on a hurt Mavs team.  Clarkson is a bonafide 6MOTY candidate yearly. Not a role player.  Eric Gordon is on a trash team so his stats don’t matter.  Malik Beasley is on the worst team in the league rn so his stats don’t matter as well. No player who puts up 18 on a good team is a role player.  AD has a career average of 67.2% if his FG assisted. So that stat means absolutely fuck all. Hunter doesn’t have to create on his own because he has Trae fucking Young on his team.
"Plenty of role players average 18. Hardaway JR is 17.6, Clarkson is 17.9, Eric Gordon is 18, Malik Beasley is 19.9. Bonafide role players. Points per game over a 18 game sample size doesn't really mean anything.   69.5% of Hunter's shots are assisted, for example. Jaylen Brown, who just made the jump out of the role player group, is sitting at 52.6 assist rate. Those things and stuff like the eye test are more important in determining whether someone is a role player rather than raw ppg.   Being a role player isn't a big diss or anything. They make up the majority of players and good role players are absolutely needed to have a successful team. But stars are needed more. Having a star on your team always takes precedence over having a role player. Hunter is a very good player, but he's ultimately a role player.   If I'm building a team from scratch, and my choice to start the team is between Zion and Hunter, it's a quick answer from me."
Dubs and TWolves had a lot of fun in these two game. This little back and forth and then last game with Malik Beasley going “BOOM” and the warriors yelling “BOOM” after like every bucket
"&gt;Bogdan Bogdanovic: 4 years, $72M  Was certainly an overpay for Bogdanovic but the Hakws had money to spend.  &gt;Malik Beasley: 4 years, $60M  Malik isn't limited as a player like Duncan is and is actually really athletic and could improve as a defender whereas Duncan's main problem on defence is that he is slow and anyone can blow by him.  Also Malik's 4th year is a TO so he got like 45/3 (and it's an ascending contract so its worth more in the subsequent years so its more in like 42/3). &gt;Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60M (before he turned into current Jerami Grant and was averaging 12/3.5/1.2)  Certainly an overpay for a guy who made his money as a defensive stopper but he has surprisingly lived up to his contract  &gt;Joe Harris: 4 years, $75M  Again Joe Harris actually has an offensive game outside of shooting 3's and is a better defender and rebounder so I'd say he is actually worth his contract meanwhile with Duncan you need to surround him with strong defenders not to bleed points."
"So why wouldn't a different shit team in need of a shooter throw the bag at him and force Miami to make the tough decision?  Other contracts from last offseason:  * Danilo Galinari: 3 years, $61.5M * Bogdan Bogdanovic: 4 years, $72M * Malik Beasley: 4 years, $60M * Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60M (before he turned into current Jerami Grant and was averaging 12/3.5/1.2) * Joe Harris: 4 years, $75M  $20M/yr might be a little high but every offseason seems full of ""wow I wasn't expecting THAT much"" contracts. I think the Joe Harris 4 years $75M is probably about right, maybe slightly more. 4 years $80M wouldn't be a complete shock."
Malik Beasley the player seems so likable but the person is less hard to root for. I pretty much stopped watching football after learning what an abusive father Adrian Peterson was
"He doesn’t get any plays called for him to get cuts/proper play calling. He gets put in a Iso and 4 guys look at him while he’s taking defenders...no off ball motion, no back screens. Nothing.   Watching the Minnesota offense is just depressing. How do you have Malik Beasley, DLo, Rubio, KAT, etc and still have a dog shit offense."
Nothing like playing against a DLo / Malik Beasley backcourt to break out of a slump
lol jesus i thought that was malik beasley
One player is the best player on a KAT-less team who's only other quality NBA player is Malik Beasley. The other player is a 3rd stringer who's looking like he's on his way out of the NBA.
Gilbert arenas and Malik Beasley
"You're right about them needing time adusting. Since last season they've literally played 5 games together. They win their first two games of this season against the Pistons and Jazz but then KAT is out because of a wrist injury. KAT comes back like a week and a half later but it's for only one game. Now he has COVID. All this constant on and off will always makes things difficult.   As for your starting lineup comment:  Dlo - 2nd best player  Malik Beasley - 3rd best player  Josh Okogie - He was out for some time but he may be the Twolves' best defender.  Juancho Hernangomez - Probably the worst starting PF in the league. This guy sucks.  KAT - Best player but has been out more games than he's played.   Another significant problem with the team is the coach. He is arguably the worst coach in the NBA..although Scott Brooks maybe takes he cake. Ryan Saunders is so intent on playing Dlo with Rubio, trying to mimic the Rockets' small ball but without the personnel. Oh Rubio can't play? No problem, let's play Dlo with another PG.   Given the circumstances Dlo is actually playing well. Shooting 40% from 3 on high volume and he's actually playing the best defense this season compared to his other seasons."
This team's best player is out and their 2nd best player (Dlo) is always being forced to play with a 2nd PG by their dumbass coach. Their third best player is Malik Beasley and they basically don't have a PF. Anthony Edwards is just a rookie so he still has a lot to learn. The rest of team wouldn't play any significant minutes on any other team.
"Malik Beasley got spotted in a mall in Minnesota wearing a mask, not safe anywhere anymore lol"
Such a lazy argument. He has literally played a total of 8 games (4 with Curry and 4 with KAT) in his career with teammates that were All-Star caliber at the time of playing. What do you expect him to do when he played with mostly Gleaguers and rookies on the Warriors and the only quality NBA player he's playing with right now is Malik Beasley.   You obviously don't watch him play anymore because if you actually did then you wouldn't say this.
Malik Beasley as well Overall def above average it seems like some of these players have yet to even hit their true potential so maybe it becomes a lot better in the future
"When one of your most noteworthy players is Malik Beasley, you clearly could use more lottery talent."
"'Did you say Malik Beasley?? He's having a hell of a year, man...'  He says something like this"
Yall someone better have saved that Malik Beasley part
Malik beasley been having a hell of a year on and off the court
Chuck is ruthless with the Malik Beasley comment
I love how uncomfortable Kenny got when they were laughing at Malik Beasley and how much of a fuck shaq and chuck didn’t give
Chuck with the random roast of Malik Beasley L O L
Malik Beasley having a hell of a year all right.. ask Larsa Pippen 😂😂😂
Snicker snicker Malik Beasley having a hell of a year
Yep Malik Beasley imitated trea young foul it was funny
"Watching the Wolves play, you got Russell, Jarrett Culver, Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, and then literally WHO? for the other guys. Because of COVID, they should have Chuck play ""Who He Play For"" every week, but they'll use 5 guys who started at least one game in the past week."
If he dates Scottie Pippen's ex now he would complete a Malik Beasley.
"This. As much as I want TD gone, we can’t get rid of him until he’s convicted  Also Malik Beasley is still with the Wolves. Antagonize them. In fact, there’s lot of scumbags in the NBA today"
"Tbh Malik himself is showing to be a good leader so far   But when youre the wolves you can't be too worried about character issues.  Thats a luxury for good teams, we need talent first and foremost .  That was my argument for re-signing Beasley even in the midst of his issues, and its worked out great so far.  Hes the second best player on the team and getting 13 mil this season"
"The rep on him and Edwards coming into the draft is they had serious offcourt stuff. Having him, Edwards, Malik Beasley with no veteran leadership around would be...interesting"
Yeah he should really take some cues from model citizen Malik Beasley
Malik Beasley on the Timberwolves is balling out
Malik Beasley and ...idk...Josh Okogie?
"...or defend better.  (Edwards is dead last in DBPM, Culver is 9th worst, Malik Beasley is 5th worst)"
Wood and Grant are the obvious ones. But surprised not yo see anything for Malik Beasley. 20ppg on good efficiency for the Wolves
 the wolves have Malik Beasley from the trade too so its not like we were left with absolutely nothing.  Hes an alright player so far. 20 ppg kind of guy
Aren’t you thinking of Malik Beasley?
Malik “47% from 3” Beasley doesn’t fit
"Levert isn’t all that great. There are so many of him in the league. Empty calorie mid-range jump shooters that are just average from three, don’t get to the rim, and don’t play defense. Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay, Will Barton, Evan Fournier, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks, Malik Beasley, etc, etc."
For those who don't want to click:  1. CJ McCollum  2. Malik Beasley  3. Christian Wood  4. Darius Garland  5. Malcolm Brogdon

"That long convoluted trade lineage ended up as Malik Beasley, who is basically a poor man's Lavine.  So it could be worse i guess"
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
"some people on the wolves sub have been calling Malik Beasley ""Papi"" on account of his leaked texts but theres no way he'd be happy with that nickname if he knew it"
"I mean you could do this for every team right. Here I'll do it for the T-Wolves:  Malik Beasley has been good for them averaging over 20 points a game, Anthony Edwards looks like he's going to be a star, Ricky Rubio is good enough to contribute for a contender, and their own pick could fall top-3 this year and they could get Cade Cunningham. D'Angelo Russell has had a rough start but once he gets going he's gonna be scary. KAT's mom passed away through COVID and he's going through a lot rn as well, and he's missed a few games through a hand injury, but there's a great chance he could get to all-NBA level play soon enough and Wolves could go on a winning streak.  But nobody gives Wolves or any other team extra context for no reason. So I'm not sure why you feel Warriors need so much extra context."
"Not even close when you have players like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant and Colin Sexton. Maybe even Malik Beasley"

"I see what you're saying,  but idk how I could vote for a guy who by all accounts is just doing what he was doing last year , even if it was a small sample size.    Same with Malik Beasley- he was putting up 20 ppg after the Nuggets traded him to the wolves, and hes putting up 20 ppg this season too.  So to me, hes just the same dude , even though you could compare his 2019-20 average to this season and think there was a big jump"
I've been a huge Malik Beasley fan since he filled in for (I think) an injured Gary Harris a few years ago in Denver. His game reminds me of Bradley Beal before Beal started playing off the dribble. I think Malik can have a Beal-esque jump and imo will average 25-27ppg one day (not this year).
"Malik Beasley is genuinely better than he was with the Timberwolves last year. He can get an easy bucket at every level, and this season he clearly worked a ton on his finishing/layup package. He's sinking everything around the rim regardless of how physical it is."
"Malik Beasley has passed a career record of 2,000 points scored. Pretty cool."

"Malik ""Mr. Pippen"" Beasley!!"
"Malik Beasley is a beast though, I hope he cools it before the game tomorrow"
Malik Beasley also gave us the work... popping threes in our face like he was Curry
"Kawhi and PG are a nightmare matchup for Jarret Culver and Malik Beasley, it's like the Timberwolve's kryptonite"
And the reason they traded Malik Beasley was so they could pay Grant.  Kinda dropped the ball on that one
Its actually not even that. More like 2 yrs $33 mil plus a team option.  Tons of these new contracts have a final year team option.  Malik Beasley the same - 3 yrs 43 mil with a team option

For us it’s definitely Malik Beasley.
We don't know considering KAT and D'lo have literally only played **3 games together**.  The team looked competent with the two of them together on the floor and contention is largely based on Culver and Anthony Edwards progressing and being the supporting pieces to the 2 stars on the team. The other and more likely option that Rosas has been aggressively exploring is a trade for a third star so expect that maybe near the trade deadline.  But your claim that our culture is fucked is so wrong because since Rosas has came here he's been developing a family type culture and players have commented on it (He made a collage of all the articles about Malik Beasley and his play with the Timberwolves to convince him to sign the contract quickly or how he made a whole presentation for J.J Reddick) and even Paul Millsap considered a move to the Timberwolves but was reluctant to pull out his kids from their schools in Denver and re-signed with the Nuggets once they whiffed on Grant.
"KAT is hurt, our best defender (Okogie) is hurt, and our options at the 4 (Hernangomez and Layman) have been abysmal so far this season.  We are getting smoked in the paint and haven't looked competent on offense since KAT went down after starting 2-0.  Basically, we don't have a reliable 4 and we are left starting Naz Reid or Ed Davis at the 5 which is not ideal.  The team looks lost offensively with KAT being out and I attribute that to poor coaching. Saunders is the son of a franchise icon coach and people are starting to realize he wouldn't be in this position without nepotism.  Dlo has looked bad, but he is at his best in the PnR game, and Reid/Davis are obviously much, much worse at that than KAT.  Dlo had some success with Davis last game, Malik Beasley is a flamethrower, and Anthony Edwards looks extremely promising in the limited opportunities he is getting.  We can turn it around (hopefully) but KAT being out shows just how dependent our roster is on him to succeed."
Malik Beasley tho 😤😤
"The Timberwolves needed a proper PG badly and had just acquired a first round pick a couple days prior as part of the Covington trade, which they later flipped for two more first round picks (2020 draft). That trade also netted them two starters in Malik Beasley and Hernangomez.   At a certain point, you don't want to just stockpile draft assets. They have enough lottery talent to where the focus needs to be winning, enough other draftees to develop on the backburner, and the understanding that cap space isn't going to be a thing for the next decade anyway if they're retaining even a few of them beyond their rookie deals."
DLo is a -114.  The second worst starter on the team is Malik Beasley at -38.  That's a 13 points/game difference.
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
Malik Beasley has been their best player if that gives you any context.
"Spencer Dinwiddie - 11M  Jusuf Nurkic - 12M  Tj Warren - 12M  Malik Beasley - 13M  Serge Ibaka - 9M  Derrick Rose - 7M  I’m not saying all of these are better value, but some of them are (I’d say Rose/Ibaka for sure)"

Because Draymond had a history of hitting other players in the groin area and the NBA even retroactively gave him a flagrant in the Houston series that same year for grabbing and holding Malik beasley on an inbound pass. It was nothing new.  Plus a swipe at someones nuts is way worse than a taunt for stepping over someone.
Pam Is Malik Beasley
"oh yeah, we're so scared of d'angelo russell and....................................................................................... *checks roster*.. malik beasley.."
"Jalen Brunson has all the signs of a breakout player about to tip over the edge. Last guy I was this confident about was Malik Beasley pre-Minnesota.  1. He's 24, but has come off the bench in a limited role his whole career so far not due to a lack of talent but because of a generational star at his position (Luka) and long time vets (JJ Barea). 2. When he has gotten the chance sans Luka he's had some stellar performances - massive sign when a player balls out when they get their shot - Wood, Sabonis, Beasley, Bam, Siakam all had this sign a fair while before people started to take notice. 3. Has become a very efficient player in his limited mins shooting 53/40/85, while averaging 13/3.5/3.5 in 25mpg. If he got more shots his efficiency would drop obviously - but he would still likely be above average for a PG. 4. Unrestricted FA the year after next, good chance he gets traded next year bc the Mavs are unlikely to pay him since he plays the same position as Luka  If he gets onto a team where he can play over 30mpg and be a full time PG I think he can easily put up anywhere from 18/5 to 22/7.  The Mavs are genuinely holding him back imo, not wrongly but nonetheless."
"It’s true, but it’s also possible that it’s only true because those guys aren’t the enablers that Westbrook is. D-Lo has played with KAT and still plays with Malik Beasley who is an insanely explosive scorer. Fox plays with Buddy Heild, who was picked before Jamal.  I’m not saying the dude is Chris Paul. All I’m saying is that he can still play and he definitely knows how to play. I don’t buy that Russ has a low basketball IQ because players like that can’t lead successful teams and usually aren’t leaders in general, which he is."
"Lmao. A new pasta is born.  Malik Beasley on Mar 27: ""I was in the pen for 12 games, but was already an OG"""
Malik Beasley
"I know Malik is out but weren’t they playing poorly beforehand. Also from someone who knows brutal seasons, just let it play out. The wolves are gonna get a top draft pick next year and with a starting 5 of DLo, Beasley, Edwards, your pick, and KAT, u will have one of the best starting rosters in terms of talent in the league"
"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
"I’d be hypocritical as a D lo fan. Don’t even know if he is safe anymore as well. Still if they want to build around KAT, D lo, Edwards, Beasley, and th young guys they need a better fit who compliments theirs styles.  I honestly thought it was going to work but Rubio with D lo just hasn’t worked out. It’s a collective issue for my opinion than one, but if you are still wanting to keep D lo with Maliks, the team needs a seasoned Versatile three and four who will help on the perimeter. Rubio just doesn’t bring enough of that and just doesn’t fit D lo who for now likes to handle the ball as a PG.   I still think it can work but it comes down to Finch hopefully getting D lo to play off-ball which I believe he can if he listened and realized it could help him more. It comes down to enforcement with the guys on this team but it hasn’t worked with anyone.   I think Rubio is solid but the team needs a respectable three and D besides D lon and Malik. I actually think a Mathews for Rubio swap could actually be a solid fit. I know Mathews hasn’t been great but I think his defense is a better fit and wouldn’t command the ball from other players."
"Malik Beasley is currently suspended by the league so that explains him. PG is gonna be at all star weekend anyway, probably got invited but turned it down"
"Bro Malik Beasley is currently suspended by the league lol, I don’t think they’d invite them to a marquee event such as the 3pt contest, but maybe the other Malik, Malik Monk from Charlotte has been shooting lights out lately from deep"
"&gt;It begs a question - are Duncan Robinson, Paul George, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Joe Harris less known or have they all been simply unavailable for the 3PT competition?     Joe Harris already won the 3pt competition before and has been outspoken about being against this years All-star weekend. I'm sure he got invited but declined it"
"Malik Beasley has said he wanted to play, but then the NBA suspended him and that leaves an awkward situation. Can you be suspended for the All-star game? If so does it reduce the amount of games you are suspended for? I vote an allstar takes a swing at someone a few games before just to see how the league reacts."
"Yup, it’s why Denver has a long list of players leaving for more minutes/bigger roles.   Jusuf Nurkic Evan Fournier Trey Lyles Malik Beasley Jerami Grant Mason Plumlee  Will Barton will definitely be next."
"Haven’t checked the stats, but I don’t think Malik Beasley has ever missed a shot against the Spurs."
Malik Beasley and Jj redick
"Peja would be ridiculous with his shooting. Gordon would maybe be like a Malik Beasley type, Baron Davis would maybe be like a Morant type.."
Malik Beasley
I think a 60M/4 years is more realistic for Norm. That is what Malik Beasley got this offseason and they are very comparable players.
I think somewhere in the malik beasley ballpark would be where he lands. He's an offensive specialist that doesnt contribute anywhere else in his game. 4 years 65 million could be possible
There was literally no proof of cheating and almost everyone involved said he wilded out for no reason including Su'a.  https://larrybrownsports.com/football/sua-cravens-cheated-malik-beasley-wife-montana-yao/569265
NBA concludes investigation: Malik Beasley has been suspended another 12 games/s

"I wonder what Kyrie, Candace Parker and the whole BLM troops have to say about this. Equality they say. If this was Jake Layman instead of Malik Beasley man, we wouldn't hear the end of it."
Is this about the Timberwolves losing Malik Beasley due to suspension and other misfortunes the team is experiencing?
"Thanks for explaining. I don’t know much about Masai’s thing besides the headlines I’ve scrolled past from this sub. In beasley’s case the Hennepin county prosecutor charged him for the weapons incident. His (now ex? I know she filed for divorce in Dec) claimed all the drugs were hers, so that is why Hennepin county didn’t pursue any drug charges for Malik. Hard to prosecute somebody when the person they are with claims ownership of all of it. She is still facing those charges from the last article I read in Jan.  We have a place up here called a “workhouse” that is not like a typical prison, it has job training/experience programs focus - the idea being to help you learn something useful in your time there so when you get out you can be productive in society. The only other case I’ve followed enough to know it resulted in a work house sentence was 6 months for facilitating a heroin deal over Reddit that ended up being cut with fentanyl and causing an OD death. The dealer got real prison and the middleman who put them in contact got sentenced to six months in the workhouse.  Point being, the workhouse is where people go to serve sentences for crimes. That’s Beasley’s sentence, but for good reason we aren’t trying to send people to jail right now if there isn’t really an ongoing danger. So he can serve his sentence at home with an ankle monitor.  To me it doesn’t seem like a huge stretch that the judge could conclude that Beasley wasn’t planning to go out and do this again. He asked to apologize to the family, which shows remorse and that he knows what he did was wrong. I just don’t think there is any evidence that there was any secret “leaning” here when the process ended in a jail sentence."
"I've posted this in other threads but my fantasy woes continue....  Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson along with random absences like Bertans, Herro, and Hayward."
Malik Beasley did nothing wrong.
So Malik Beasley pointed a rifle at people and it’s somehow because of the PC police.  You’re a fucking idiot lmao
Are we talking about the same Malik Beasley or am I tripping? https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/timberwolves-malik-beasley-faces-multiple-charges-after-allegedly-aiming-a-gun-at-a-family-outside-his-home/
"[this](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30867715/timberwolves-malik-beasley-sentenced-sept-arrest).  As the kids say, it's not what you want"
"Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are mature young guys, same with Jevon Carter.    I think Anthony Edwards has all the potential in the world, and KAT is an Elite talent.   They are worth keeping.     But everyone else is not good for the Timberwolves, including Malik Beasley.    It doesn't matter how many points you put up, if you character isn't gonna help the team. It would be smart to trade him.    Trade Rubio to the Clippers for Lou Will, T Mann, and Daniel Oturu"
"Yes, that's generally how the NBA works. Jarrett Culver was drafted by the Timberwolves and they traded for Malik Beasley and then a year later they drafted yet another guy at the same position and his minutes are down as a result. There are a very limited amount of spots available for all NBA roles and many more people working to get them."

Malik Beasley has been his best move   Unless he didn't mess up the first pick in thedraft
He gets less calls than fucking Malik Beasley or some shit or Cedí osman and he is the biggest player in the league lol
Not the same  If I were to make a thread saying the Celtics should trade Jaylen Brown for Malik Beasley Jarred Vanderbilt and a first then we would be talking
Can we have Malik Beasley?
You misspelt Malik Beasley in the title
Well this is either really good news or really bad news for Malik Beasley in my fantasy..
Malik Beasley did that
"There's a couple things to consider:  \- Dlo and KAT have played 3 games this season. Two of them were victories with one being vs the Jazz. We really don't know what this team is.  \- Their coach flat out sucks. Prior to DLo's injury, Saunders would always play Dlo/Rubio lineup. He is persistent on having two PGs on the floor at the same time. Just doesn't make sense.   \- In his career, Dlo has only played 8 games with an All-Star caliber teammate (Steph and KAT). The only other decent player while on the Wolves this season (with KAT out) was Malik Beasley. Edwards is a rookie and everyone else is just trash.   We saw wonderful things happen when Dlo was on a decent team and under a good coach (Atkinson). His first year he played during Kobe's farewell tour and under Byron Scott, then played under Walton during his year. Right now he's playing for a coach who only has his job because of nepotism.  What is the point I'm trying to make? Dlo has had one of the weirdest careers for a lottery pick who is deemed decent. I just want to see him on a team that will use him correctly for once."
He has a very similar stat line to Malik Beasley on the season which I find kind of funny for some reason.
"They have one great player and he's been hurt/out a ton since last year.  Beasley has been great, but when KAT was out they weren't gonna win anything with Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards and Naz Reid as the 3 best players of a team."
"I want Nurse to let him play in the playoffs before we decide. If he can start and provide solid minutes for us, I think 15-20 a year is very realistic. Norm might get more from a different team that promises him more opportunity like Malik Beasley"
Malik “Papi” Beasley
Malik Beasley is averaging 21ppg and shooting 40% from 3 on 9 attempts per game
malik beasley couldn’t believe it lol
Malik Beasley or Jordan Clarkson money.
I mean Malik Beasley was in this game too.
Alexi Schved is a euroleague god and was pretty pedestrian in the NBA so I think there's a lot of guys that could do it. I think the line is somewhere around Malik Beasley   It probably does help being euro though just for the familiarity with the rules and team chemistry and whatnot
Malik Beasley liked all the pics of the female ref (Simone Jelks) on IG. Conflict of Interest??  https://www.instagram.com/la_anomalia/?igshid=1sds08zaox20o
The disrespect to Malik Beasley is palpable here.
I used to think Nuggets had great depth.. seems like they lost a lot of really good pieces. Genuinely asking.. why did they trade Malik Beasley again? He’s balling right now.
"This is the definition of moving the goal posts. I'm not a big Malone guy... but whether, for example, he failed Malik Beasley has nothing to do with whether Beasley was an excellent mid-round pick by Tim.  Also, your insinuation that Tim doesn't play a HEAVY role in scouting shows that you are off you're rocker or disingenuous af.  Dude lives for the draft and calls it his favorite holiday of the year."
Yeah...nah  Example: Malik Beasley came into this season wanting to improve his defense. He is athletic. He really does try hard on that end. But he still is cheeks on defense. His efforts didn’t magically make him better on that end.
Malik Beasley
Poor Malik Beasley
"Malik Beasley, as well"
Malik Beasley should get looks. He was good for Minn last season after the trade but that was just a handful of games.
"He’s part of the reason they’re bad.  If you’re a true all star on a bad team, at the very least you should be able to put up some numbers. And he can’t even do that. Malik Beasley has been outplaying him."
Malik Beasley &amp; Terry Rozier
"I'm a big fan of him but definitely not LOL. Even Malik Beasley has a better argument than him this year. His team and coach are both trash, and the only real positive for Dlo this year is his 3P% of 40% on high volume."
The Larsa Pippen/Malik Beasley special!
Malik Beasley has proved me wrong twice.   I thought he would be better when he was in Denver and then I sold him off. Now he’s ballin out for the at Twolves

"Malik was a rfa. If we wanted him he’d stay. He wanted a bigger role and we could of gave it to him if we wanted to.   Though now I think the Beasley situation shows a lack of thinking by the FO. They didn’t prioritize Beasley because 1. Lack of planning with Harris and Barton’s contracts 2. Their cheap 3. The realize they’re probably only going to pay grant, so they basically allocated money for grant before grant even signed. Looking back that’s dumb not to have a back up plan"
"Beasley probably leaves anyways. Heck, he already wants more shots than the 17 FGA/gm he's currently getting in MIN.  &gt; Malik Beasley said after Friday's loss to the Hornets that he feels that he needs to be used even more. ... Ryan Saunders has looked to get his starters' minutes down to about 32 per game according to Jon Krawszynski of The Athletic, but Beasley feels that he can do even more. “I feel like I’m in the best shape of my life,” Beasley, who has had conversations about his minutes with Saunders and the training staff, said. **“I feel like I need to be used more** because I don’t feel like I get tired. If I do, I tell the team to come get me.”  https://www.nbcsports.com/edge/basketball/nba/player/30314/malik-beasley/news  And you know that's not Malik asking for tougher defensive assignments. He doesn't play any defense (that's why he doesn't get tired).  So there's no way Beasley would be happy with the 10 FGA/gm that Barton gets as a 4th option in DEN."
[Isn't Beasley going to jail at the end of the season?](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/30867715/timberwolves-malik-beasley-sentenced-sept-arrest)
 2016 – Malik Beasley – 19th overall  2017 – Monte Morris – 51st overall  2018 – MPJ – 14th overall  2020 – Zeke Nnaji – 22nd Overall  2020 – RJ Hampton – 24th overall  The way this FO keeps hitting on these mid/late-round picks is crazy
"Damn Malik Beasley averages 20+ PPG? I know it's on a rat team, but still."
"Malik Beasley, literally Klay Thompson but no all-star because t-wolves record is poo poo"
Malik Beasley gonna overtake that in two seasons or so if he can keep remotely close to how he's been shooting lately.
Malik Beasley. 20ppg scorer with passable defence. But he can't create his own shot well enough to be considered all-star potentially
"What? Why do people on Reddit come off condescendingly when they’re so wrong? Firstly, I was referring to Malik Beasley over the past 2 years. Secondly, Mike Beasley did play for the Wolves for several years where he had his best seasons in the early years of his career. Google something before you reply"
Edwards seems great.  Fuck Malik Beasley.
"KAT, DLo, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jordan McLaughlin  That would leave out: Rubio, Culver, Okogie, Hernangomez, Nowell, Layman, Davis  I would hope then that Rubio and Hernangomez get picked up"
"I'm not necessarily saying it's cut-and-dried. I *do* think record matters. But statistically? Is Mitchell really ahead of Shai or Fox or Zion or Ingram?  What about the Suns? They're the 4-seed, and we haven't mentioned anybody on that team. (And the guy we should mention is Paul, not Booker)  What about the Spurs? They're 1 game out of the 4-seed...what does that mean for DeRozan?   Or if you care less about narrative and team record, Malik Beasley is having a pretty damn solid year, and I can make the  case for him over Mitchell (especially if I have *Conley* over Mitchell.)  Obviously he's hurt *now* but Christian Wood was putting up 22-10.   If CJ had played more games, he'd be clearly ahead of Donovan, too.   and, of course, KAT has missed most of the year (which obviously makes his case a non-starter) but if he hadn't, that would be another guy clearly ahead of Mitchell.   My point is that that phrase (""all star caliber"") should mean something like ""top 25"" not ""top 40""  because only 24 guys get to be all stars.  And it's very possible to be a top-2 seed with just one top-25 guy."
Malik Beasley
Malik Beasley or Terry Rozier with the ultimate green light to do whatever on a bad team
Thanks again for your insight.   I caught some of the game yesterday and I was shocked at why Beasley wasn't in the game for a big chunk of the 4th quarter. I'm not exactly sure what the coaches were waiting for.   Malik Beasley has to be in discussions for MIP

Malik Beasley exists
malik beasley really just dropped 16 pts in the first quarter
He’s better but it’s like Malik Beasley. They both were role players on Denver and went to other teams and now they are potential all stars. Denver is a really deep team
"5% over league average would be good though right?   Also context matters. Yes he was mediocre earlier in his career but he's been getting better. Last season he played on a team mostly full of rookies and G-leaguers so he was the only one getting serious attention on defense. When everyone else is bad, you gotta take the most # of shots.  This Timberwolves team (at least without KAT) is pathetic too as well as the coach. The only other solid player other than KAT and Dlo is Malik Beasley. Edwards is getting there but he's a rookie. And yeah that coach...arguably the worst coach in the league. He is so persistent on playing Dlo and Rubio together. Makes zero sense.   You have every right to have your doubts, but I do believe he has gotten better from 3."
"A lot of these aren't bad takes at the time, the circumstances changed and so, like smart people do, their takes change. Like there were legitimate concerns about LaMelo coming in. People buying into to those and him doing well isn't a bad thing.   &gt;the Malik Beasley contract  Also love how you slipped that one in"
"**2020**: Zeke Nnaji at 22, RJ Hampton at 24.  **2019:** Bol Bol at 44.  **2018:** Michael Porter Jr at 14.  **2017:** Monte Morris at 51.  **2016:** Jamal Murray at 7, Malik Beasley at 19  **2014:** Nikola Jokic at 41."
"Easily the top three have to be Wood, Grant and Malik Beasley, no?"
"Malik Beasley is top 3, Grant will probably win it though. Beasley is averaging 20.5/5.2/2.5 on 45/38/86 shooting splits. That’s 12 PPG more than his previous season with Denver."
-Malik Beasley
Malik Beasley not having the best game
Malik Beasley is underrated and having a great season
"I think it’s probably Grants to lose but Woods is close behind. Malik Beasley at least belongs in the conversation, but behind those two."
"Probably, but shoutout to Malik Beasley. Guys an efficient 20 ppg scorer."
"Depending on our level of play once kat returns and if we keep our pick we traded to gs (only a 40% chance if we finish bottom 3) trading kat is an interesting thought exercise. Its starting to become inevitable at this point and seeing some of the recent hauls for superstars (imo) you gotta wonder what a rebuild around anthony edwards, malik beasley and say cade cunningham and assets from kat and probably dlo would look like"
"Of the 4 officers involved, 1 is black and 1 is Asian. 2 of the 4 were rookies in their first week of active duty.  Also: Malik Beasley getting off with a slap on the wrist is **not** the case to be using as evidence of racism in the court system."
&gt;Except the emotional damage of being threatened with a gun by someone who is supposed to love you   I agree that you can have trauma from the experience but why should Malik Beasley love a random family going through his neighborhood.
"Right but its just not practical with the wolves roster.  So its kind of a moot point. We need him playing 35 minutes a night , especially since Malik beasley is out for the year now .  If we get lucky and get the top pick , that could change things by bringing Cade here"
"I don’t think he’s underrated, there are just a ton of young talents in the league so he gets left out. RJ was a 3rd overall pick for a reason, he’s good. He will be great in his prime but I don’t necessary think he’s a top 25 young player yet.   Dejounte Murray is averaging 16-7-5. Darius Garland is averaging 17-6 on 45-40-85 shooting, Malik Beasley is averaging 20ppg on 44-40-85 shooting. Lots of great young players that are left out because the league is so filled with them."
"1. Injuries, this team played fully healthy in the first two games of the season but KAT's injury really derailed their season as a whole. We still don't know if the core of KAT, D'Lo, Edwards and Beasley is actually good because we have only seen them play for two games.  2. Coaching, Ryan Saunders probably made his gameplan around KAT and after he was injured he didn't have second plan. Hence D'Lo tried to carry this team but he failed miserably as only good teammate he had was Malik Beasley. (Anthony Edwards was pretty bad and inefficient.) He tried to implement a gameplan that obviously did not work, and he was fired after going 7-24. But in the great news, Chris Finch looks like he is a pretty great coach, at least after the ASB. The teams record is 6-10 after the All-Star Break and Edwards and KAT looks like completely different players. We knew what KAT was capable of but Edwards came in as a surprise as he is averaging 25 PPG with %54 TS after the all-star break.  3. While a trio of KAT, Edwards and D'Lo looks really good on the paper, basketball is a team sport at the end. Even if you score 60+ PPG as a trio every game, if your teammates are bad, you're not going to win the game. While they have great pieces like Jaden McDaniels, Malik Beasley and Naz Reid to an extent, other players are not helping. Jarrett Culver looks like he is a bust without confidence, Okogie is an offensive liability and Rubio, while his playmaking is still pretty good, he shoots %38 from the field. And the bad thing is I really don't know if they could fix this. We don't have a lot of trade pieces as our first round pick and second round picks were traded and I don't know if free agents would want to come to a team that is the worst team in the NBA.  4. KAT, Edwards and D'Lo are good, but their defense is really bad. To be fair, KAT and Edwards improved a little bit on that front, but they are still pretty bad. KAT improved his pick and roll defense and Ant gets a steal here and there but they just allowed 141 to an Indiana team that didn't have Sabonis, Turner or Brogdon. They are pretty [self-aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mmi27z/anthony_edwards_coach_cant_come_on_the_floor_he/) about their defensive problems and Edwards at least shows effort on that front but they still need to learn how to do team defense. We'll see if they will fix these problems in the off-season I guess."
"I honestly wish the Timberwolves never existed. They misery is so immense it spreads to other teams. They have 2 first overall picks, the 2nd overall pick, and Malik Beasley and despite all of this are the worst team in the NBA by a good margin and don't even own their pick and will more likely than not go the the fucking Warriors of all teams. It is disgustingly sad how poverty they are."
Morally I have to say Malik Beasley.  However taking away off the court issues it's Jarrett Culver. The guy fucking sucks and seeing him on the court just reminds me we traded away a potential Tyler Herro or PJ Washington + Dario Saric for him
Malik Beasley
"Minny just lost Malik Beasley for the season, sadly"
Malik beasley. He more focused on scottie pippens wife and pointing guns at people
Think that was Malik beasley who got called on thT foul
"&gt;Oubre is a better fit for the starting line up than Beasley, if you're priority is to win. His two way ability is more valuable than Malik Beasley's 6th man style offense   Beasley is a 40% shooter on 9 attempts lol. His production on offence is invaluable."
"Oubre is a better fit for the starting line up than Beasley, if you're priority is to win. His two way ability is more valuable than Malik Beasley's 6th man style offense"
"&gt;Neither, because they’re both rookies and neither are the best players on their team lol  Considering for the good part of the past month Malik Beasley has been out with a suspension and Ant was the #2 guy on the roster. Teams definitely gameplanned for him.  &gt;For the games he’s played amazing, there are several more that he’s costed you with inefficiency. It doesn’t mean those games aren’t flashes of who he could become more consistently, but to say that’s who he is right now is wrong.  I mean when you look at the roster can you even say one guy is to blame for the losses?"
"&gt;What does that even mean lol  Because you look at Haliburton's %'s and decide he's more efficient so he's better but then you look and see 80% of his 3 pointers are assisted and more shots overall are assisted. Any rookie if they were asked to be the #1 or #2 option will see their %'s plummet.  &gt;Nobody is saying Edwards is a bad rookie, he’s in contention for RoTY. But to say he’s better than Beasley already is false.  the thing is they are really close at the moment, Ant has much better vision and can collapse a defence (not to mention create his own shot) but Malik is a knockdown 3 point shooter."
malik beasley definitely could be starting for a good team and his contract is looking nice.  al horford would be a wanted commodity if he made 10mil less.
"He'd be the perfect fit next to towns, they compliment eachother so well. Malik Beasley and 3 firsts might do it"
It really depends. Ant is a much better iso scorer than Beasley and he can create for himself better than Malik.  Like if I had o trade one Malik would be out the door.
"&gt; 4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all.  If Nash tried to double the number of 3s he takes, then defenses would play him differently and prevent him from taking that many 3s. Nash has to focus on running on offense more than trying to take 9.4 3s a game. He'd shoot more 3s, like 7-8, but not 9.4 lol. And even shooting that many more 3s he wouldn't be averaging some of the ridiculous points I see on this thread.  &gt; single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he’s averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now  Van vleet has a faster shot release and doesn't have playmaking responsibilities like Nash would have.  &gt; Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier  All of those guys, aside from Lonzo, aren't the playmaking point guards of their team who have to run the offense like Nash has to.   &gt; If think fucking Steve Nash can’t attempt 9.4 or more in today’s game   He wouldn't, because the only guys taking them are Steph, Dame, and Buddy Hield."
"4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all. I’ve seen almost every single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he’s averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now and is NOT that great of a shot creator, taking ill advised shots is one of his worst qualities.   Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier all average 8-9 three point attempts a game. If think fucking Steve Nash can’t attempt 9.4 or more in today’s game then you are flat out misinformed and either never watch Nash play, don’t watch modern basketball or both."
"Bruh. They did try to make it work during the Love and KG years. Are you under the impression that they were trying to lose?  KG was the sort of player that could carry a franchise and he did. They tried to pair him with a lot of guys without much success. The biggest issue during the KG era was the Joe Smith debacle which really hurt the franchise.  Love wasn't the sort of guy that could carry a team and they never found a guy to pair with him that was great. Rubio didn't turn out as good as they had hoped, Derrick Williams with the number 2 pick turned out terribly.  &gt;It would’ve given them incentive to make Butler work instead of going to tank mode with KAT.  They aren't trying to tank with KAT though. They are clearly trying to win but due to injuries, Covid, Malik Beasley pointing guns at people and Ant being young they just aren't that good."
It is though. There are guys who rack up assists who don’t score as much like Chris Paul who are considered better offensive players than a guys like Terry Rozier and Malik Beasley even though they are averaging 20 a game.
He’s the next Malik Beasley. 20 plus points with 1 rebound and 1 assist.
I understand he needs some time to get back into shape but Malik Beasley has been ice cold since he returned.
Neither. Let’s all talk about how Malik Beasley was allowed to take 30+ clutch shots.

"It’s funny, Malik Beasley is better than Wiggins and people were mocking us for signing him to $15 mil.   Beasley is a guy you wouldn’t hate to have for $20-25, Wiggins is the guy you wouldn’t hate at $12-15 a year.  JMHO"
"Malik Beasley is better than Wiggins and people were mocking us for signing him to $15 mil.   Beasley is a guy you wouldn’t hate to have for $20, Wiggins is the guy you wouldn’t hate at $12-15 a year."
Malik Beasley literally missed games as consequence for a fucking gun charge. Immature as hell.
"You forgot the best of them all, Isaac.   Also bacon is starting but sucks and Malik Beasley is from FSU as well"
Malik Beasley as the 6th man too.  Impact from the bench like he's LouWill.
Malik Beasley
How can you watch Malik beasley shoot like that and say Ant single handedly won it
"This off-season the timberwolves should offer the Mavs Malik Beasley for Maxi Kleber and something - Dorian Finney-Smith and a 1st, Jalen Brunson and a highly protected 1st, etc. Mavs get a scoring guard, which they need, and the wolves get a defensive PF, which they desperately need."
that doesn't stop a man like Malik Beasley from flying them out
"Ridiculous, meanwhile a post about Malik Beasley costing the state of Minnesota free Arby’s is allowed to stay and blow up."
That Malik Beasley shot was something else.
Malik Beasley is a fucking doughnut
"Maybe not but dude is an elite shooter whose shot you can't block, and currently Malik beasley averages 20, so I have little doubt MPJ could as well"
I ended up dropping Malik Beasley instead since Young still nets me a good amount of assists and seems to have a higher FG% atm.
Malik Beasley
"Wiggins got to play 39 games with Steph Curry vs 4 for Dlo, he’s going to look better when he’s not the main focus of the other team. Dlo played 2 games with KAT before he went down to injury and became the focal point for a team that has one other shooter in Malik Beasley.  The fact that he’s even an average scorer and playmaker is all the wolves needed to begin with, they had Jeff Teague as their starting point guard who could do neither.   Warriors didn’t need dlo because a 3 guard lineup would make no sense for them, this was the context before Klay was ruled out for the season. Wiggins wasn’t making Minnesota any better, and honestly he’s playing the same way for them as he was here. People think it’s different now because they’re finally watching him consistently. If Curry was out again and you had Wiggins as your main piece the fans would definitely complain  The roster does need construction but Gersson said from the beginning he doesn’t expect a playoff appearance until next season, the roster does need work. Now if this team was fully healthy a lineup of   Dlo - Beasley - Ant - Vando/Jmac - KAT is definitely talented enough to be in the discussion for 8th seed if everything goes perfectly to being in the playin seed discussion. Ryan also was a terrible coach tbh the wolves should have at least 5-10 more wins than they do rn, so many blown 4th quarter leads"
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"For those who don't know who he is. He is the brother of Jalen from the Hornets. He was a top 5 high school prospect who had a rough year at Washington before falling to 28.  He's a skinny 3/4 hybrid that was seen as a project that would take about 3 years.  Due to poor performances from all of the PF's on our roster as well as dudes filling in at the 4 (Okogie, Layman, Juancho) both Vanderbilt and McDaniels ended up being forced into rotation.  Jaden has been an absolute revelation for us. He's a fearless defender that loves to get a block and is a decent scorer putting up a career high against New Orleans.  He has been the brightest of bright sparks this season alongside Malik Beasley. Some of our beat reporters like Britt Robson even believe that he will be better than Anthony Edwards, whilst that is unlikely, the sky is the limit for Jaden"
"Bro Malik Beasley literally pulled out the 9. Oh wait he didn’t, he had a rifle."
Malik Beasley pulled a gun out on a family but you think MPJ saying some ignorant shit makes him the biggest clown in the league lol?
"They’ve been right on the outside of the playoffs looking in before even without butler. I think with butler but without towns theyd be in the same place. Wiggins isn’t a factor here, but the rest of the t Wolves today are just absolute shite, Malik Beasley has been the second best player"
"Well considering the Wolves have played some stupid small amount of games with their star D'Angelo Russell and KAT on the court at the same time and have had Ricky Rubio in the worst season of his career really Malik Beasley and Ant Man are the only hope outside of the two stars and no one plays defense rlly. The Hornets are so much of a better team lol, between having a healthy Hayward and the best contract in the league with Terry Rozier not to mention PJ Washington, Devonte Graham, very valuable young pieces that scream future starter in addition to Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, Miles Bridges all very valuable role players. Not to mention the Hornets have been mostly healthy for the entire year"
Malik Beasley sheesh
"If I were them I wouldn’t be trading Malik Beasley for Collins. Collins is a better player in a vacuum but Beasley has a much better contract and paying Collins, D’lo, and KAT maxes is not going to get you anywhere."
He's probably the brightest of spots along with Malik Beasley
"Exactly, with scoring and pace going up PPG is weighted less heavily, more emphasis on two way players, 3pt shooting and switching. 16 players over 25ppg and another 22 above 20ppg. 38 players over 20ppg and a good chunk of them shouldn’t be in the all star game. Guys like Fred VanVleet, Khris Middleton, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Collin Sexton."
Malik Beasley
"The issue is the inconsistency in the level of punishment. If a player commits severe domestic abuse or a similar transgression the punishment should be greater than that given to someone who used recreational drugs. That would mean either the suspension is greater than two years, or it could mean that two years is much too long for someone that uses drugs.  Malik Beasley just recently got caught with pounds of weed and more importantly threatened a family with an assault rifle. He pled guilty. The league only suspended him for 12 games.   Lance Stephenson, pushed his girlfriend down a flight of stairs in her Brooklyn apartment building. According to police reports at the time, Stephenson then grabbed her and hit her head against the bottom step. The league didn't fine or suspend him.  These were all objectively worse offenses and the league should adjust its consequences to reflect the severity of the offense."
Malik Beasley didn't do anything bad. In many states what he did wasn't even a crime
"Sweet, now on my fantasy team the only guys I have hurt/not playing are: Embiid, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, DeAndre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson and David Bertans."
"Malik Beasley deserves to be in MIP talk, hes been one of the best 3pt shooter in the league this year."
Malik Beasley
Malik Beasley
As a Wolves fan I’d way rather have Malik Beasley than Collins.
Wait you have people saying that Maxey could be the centerpiece in a Lowry deal and here you have him being traded along with a first round pick and other players for Malik Beasley??
I don’t see the problem? Malik Beasley and Dlo got the same treatment when they missed a test/were late
"So many what-abouts in this thread. I also don’t think domestic abusers or drunk drivers deserve multimillion contracts to play sports when they’ve done vile shit, but here we are. Malik Beasley or Nunn or whoever being allowed to play doesn’t change how I feel about this."
"If Malik Beasley doesn’t get cut for actually threatening to kill someone by waiving a gun at them in his front yard, then I’m not shocked that they won’t cut Leonard for this."
"Usually its not a situation where Team A trades say picks 17 and 20 to Team B for pick 12.  Because like you said, Team B would rather just have the shot at the better player  But what you can do is trade 17 and 20 to get maybe a promising young player whos going to be a restricted free agent that Team B doesn't want to pay.  Malik Beasley for example when the Nuggets were looking to trade him last year.  Or like this season with the Hawks trying to trade John Collins.   That's just an example, but theres many things you can do with non-lottery first rd picks to improve your teams outlook"
"&gt;They also had two very good wing defenders in Beasley and grant  lmfao Malik Beasley, a good wing defender? If he was, he'd still be on the team. And Grant, for one season, only started 22/71 games.   Y'all can make any excuse you want for not actually watching him play, but Nikola remains an above-average to good defender and the best offensive player in the league."
Malik Beasley about to go off on the new female refs
"For real, dude.  &gt;""Malik Beasley got off easy.""  &gt;""What are you on about, he very clearly got a slap on the wrist.""  &gt;""BUt tHe NarRAtIVe"""
PG: Steph Curry (43 mil)  SG: Malik Beasley (13.3 mil)  SF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (27.6 mil)  PF: Zion Williamson (10.2 mil)  C: Richaun Holmes (5 mil)  For 99.1 million
Malik Beasley keeps getting scummier.
[He got suspended without pay and lost $1million after he pleaded guilty.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30965255/minnesota-timberwolves-malik-beasley-suspended-12-games-guilty-plea)
"Malik Beasley shoved a gun in a family's face and that was an actual conviction. Most people don't care about it though. Idk about anyone else, but I'll take a racial slur over potential death any day lol. Not saying either should be banned or that Meyers should have no punishment, but there's definitely no consistency."
Go and have a look at the Malik Beasley ones
Malik Beasley pointed a gun at a family and was smashing someone else before legally divorcing his wife. Thats way worse than saying a slur on stream
"Malik Beasley never should have gotten in trouble, he can't point a gun at people who trespassed on his property which was roped off from the rest of the tour? That's complete bs. Racist criminal justice system.  If he was white, NRA woulda made him a flagship of their next campaign"
"Malik Beasley still has a job, I think saying a racial slur isn't nearly on the level of pointing a gun at someone."
"I agree that Nance is a bargain and a good player.  That’s not the point.    Cleveland is under the cap next year.  If they trade Nance for a 20s first next year and a future first, they gain $9 million in cap space.    So they can have their team + $9 mil in cap space, and sign a $9 mil player.   Or they can trade Nance and that $9 mil player for an $18 mil player and 2 first round picks.    That’s it.  That’s the value.    Does a rebuilding team want Nance and a $9 mil free agent, or an $18 mil free agent and 2 first round picks?  Malik Beasley is a good example of an $18 mil free agent, for reference."
Herro is already way better off the dribble and PnR operator than Malik Beasley. He’s no spot up shooter
Disrespectful to CJ Kemba and Dragic..  Herro’s ceiling is malik beasley
Malik Beasley with the clutch suspension
Malik Beasley and Ben Simmons might be interested.
No salt just exhausted lol we also have Malik Beasley out too who can catch fire from 3. (Tho I think he gets traded this offseason)
I'm curious if Pacers fan would accept something around Myles Turner for Malik Beasley.
Actually Malik Beasley one of our best shooters is not healthy.
"There aren't that many teams who are actually tanking though? The tanking that has taken place has been more egregious, but half of the bottom 6 teams would have significantly better records if they hadn't been injured all year.  The Cavs were actually playing decent basketball at the start of the season, but since then it's been a revolving door of players who are out for some injury or another.  The Rockets are not an amazing team, and their talent level is way above their current record. They've been the most injured team in the league so of course they lost a lot of games.  The Timberwolves have 82 missed games between KAT, DLo, and Malik Beasley. That's 3 of their top 4 players who will finish the season playing like 60 % of games. Their team's probably still not that good, but again, they are not tanking, their best players have just been injured or got COVID.  Detroit, OKC, and Orlando are the only teams that have actually been trying to lose games."
"My point was just that many superstars get easy rebounds as teammates cede them.  James Harden (8 REB/game), Bruce Brown (5 REB/game), and Malik Beasley (4 REB/game) all average about 1.5 contested rebounds a game. Some rookie like Okoro is averaging 1.1 contested rebounds, but is totaling under 3. Josh Okogie is similar (1.3 contested but 2.9 total)."
"Has KAT proven he can lead a team yet? No. But it’s also hard to do that when your best teammates the last couple of years have been Andrew Wiggins, 40 odd games of DLo and Malik Beasley, a 19 year old rookie and Ricky Rubio."
"Nuggets IMO. They had Jerami Grant as a role player off the bench if I recall correctly. Come to find out, he’s an all-star caliber player. They had Malik Beasley and Juancho rotting at the end of their bench last year. When Beasley was traded to Minny, he showed that he was a 20 Ppg scorer. Juancho is also a starter now. This year they are even better and probably have a better bench too."
Watch some of those wolves games where Malik Beasley was the only player other than Ant who could put the ball in the hoop.  It was most definitely not good for the Ant Man
"Yeah bro, The reason Lamelo gets more assists cuz he has teammates to pass to. Gordon and Rozier can both shoots, Bridges is his lob buddy.  Edwards' main passing options for most of the season were Malik Beasley and Naz Reid. And even when KAT came back, DLo and Beas went out, Making KAT the only player he could trust. The players around him matter.  His recent performances since KAT and DLo returns:  42 points, 7 assists, 6 rebounds  29 points, 6 assists, 9 rebounds  14 points, 4 assists, 9 rebounds,   19 points, 5 assists, 8 rebounds  So its not like Ant cant pass and rebound. When he has players around him that can actually do something, then his assists go up."
"Look the only starter being shipped out is Malik Beasley. DLo, KAT and Ant have amazing in game chemistry together and you can tell that the wins will be coming next year as long as our offseason is okay"
I know it was last season but Malik beasley as well
"Rubio wasn’t better in Utah or Phoenix than he was in his first Timberwolves stint. And Malik Beasley looks way better on the Timberwolves than he did on the Nuggets.  Yes the Timberwolves aren’t great, but your being pretty disingenuous with your reasoning"
Sounds like something Malik Beasley would say
have you ever seen malik beasley and dlo in the same room together
Why is there a picture of Malik Beasley
"I forget.... Have members of the nuggets front office been poached the last few years? Of course the players get credit, but they've been the deepest team in the league for a minute. To think they've had so much talent that they've had to get rid of guys like Malik beasley, jusuf nurkic, and jerami grant so that those players can find teams with more available minutes."
See if Malik Beasley can be traded for
No Malik Beasley or Thad Young?
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
Malcolm Brogdon  Malik Beasley  Mikal Bridges  Miles Bridges  Marvin Bagley
"Safe to say he's starting even when Beasley returns, right?   Malik is better right now, but Edwards development has to come first and I don't think Malik cares if he's coming off the bench."
"2016-17: Lavine, Wiggins, and Towns are all 21 with a 26 year old Rubio, ""Wolves look spooky"".    2017-18: Butler with a young Wiggins and Towns, ""Wolves look spooky"".    2018-19: Still have the same core from the previous year to start the season. Before the locker room issues became headline news, nephews said ""Wolves look spooky"".    2019-20: 23 year-old Malik Beasley and DeAngelo Russel, with 24 year-old Towns, ""Wolves look spooky"".     2020-21: Beasley, Russel, and Towns with first round pick Anthony Edwards, ""Wolves look spooky"".    Sure, the phrase has normally been used sarcastically, but the only reason it's continued to have relevance is because nephews continually believe it to be true. Timberwolves are perpetually 2-3 years from contending, and their fans let us know about it every year."
"If we finish our the year winning like 9 of our last 12 games, maybe its not that talent-depleted.  Maybe its that we just had a ton of injuries to our key players and now they're (mostly) healthy finally.  Except for Malik Beasley , who is probably out for the year"
And they still haven't really played with Malik Beasley. They have all been hurt/suspended at different times.
We're still missing our 3rd best scorer and would be MIP candidate if he wasn't a fucking idiot (Malik Beasley)
They’re winning a lot rn so who knows if they’ll still have the 2nd worst record by the end of the year but they’ll probably have a top 5 pick at least. That player plus their team right now and Malik Beasley back could easily be a top 6 team. They could also be closer to 10 but that’s just because the Western Conference is so absolutely incredible and talented
Wolves are missing their 3rd best (or second best depending on who you ask) player too in Malik beasley
And I think Malik Beasley has only played 4 games with Dlo and KAT
"Yeah , I really like it potentially as a long term solution.  People keep saying Beasley should be the 6th man but nah, Malik isn't a shot creator.  He has to play with a distributor whereas Dlo can get his own shot.  And obviously Dlo would be in the closing lineup because as we saw tonight, hes lethal"
"&gt;VIII) The easy fixes for Anthony Edwards  I continue to be bullish on Edwards. His growing chemistry with Karl-Anthony Towns has been one of the joys of the past two months -- how they bob and weave in concert, faking a handoff one way before flipping it the other direction. The return of D'Angelo Russell has interrupted that development a tad, but talent is talent, and the Wolves need all they can get.  Minnesota is 6-6 with Russell and Towns available. Josh Okogie rediscovered his confidence from deep, though we know how that movie usually ends. Jaden McDaniels is legit; the Okogie/McDaniels pairing is the type of defensive bulwark the Russell/Edwards/Towns nucleus needs, though I'm skeptical it brings enough shooting.  Meanwhile, Malik Beasley and his 20 points per game are missing; the Russell/Beasley/Towns/Edwards quartet has logged just 13 minutes. Such bad luck could only befall the Wolves.  Minus his nightly steal, Edwards has been bad on defense -- as expected for a teenager. It takes time for score-first guys to learn the complexities of NBA schemes. Barring some lack of will, Edwards should become at least an average defender.  He can start with the low-hanging fruit of transition defense. Minnesota is as bad there as the Kings, and way worse with Edwards on the floor -- in both volume of transition chances and opponent efficiency, per Cleaning The Glass data.  Edwards can be slow to realize when he should ditch his matchup and take the closest opposing player:  He sometimes meanders toward the offensive glass -- too halfhearted to count as ""crashing"" -- when he has little chance at a rebound. Edwards has 47 offensive rebounds in 60 games, so the risk-reward is not working.  Ambling cuts to nowhere can undo Minnesota's floor balance:  Edwards has good intentions: making himself available for the corner-to-corner pass. But Naz Reid -- having a very nice season! -- is already there, with two other Wolves under the basket.  This is fixable with experience and care. If we are having this same discussion in two years, it's a problem."
Malik Beasley?
Why did I read this as Malik Beasley?
"And Malik Beasley, but he’s barely played, too."
"How do you know Edwards doesnt contribute to winning? he was the #1 pick that went to the worst team in the league, on top of that D'lo missed 33+ games, KAT missed 20+ games, Malik Beasley is out for the season. You cant ignore these factors for why the Wolves are terrible."
LaMelo Ball ain’t Malik Beasley
Malik Beasley missed 12 games with a suspension and when he came back he shot like shit. Players need time to get back into the groove
"&gt; karl anthony towns, D'lo, ~~malik beasley~~, and ricky rubio  That combo listed had the Pacers without 4 starters drop 75 on their head in the first half if that gives you any indication."
"I've been saying this, in what way does karl anthony towns, D'lo, malik beasley, and ricky rubio only win 15 games so far"
He’s like Malik Beasley. Just good enough on offense to trick a team into overpaying him and bad enough on defense to detract from his team’s ability to win.
Unbiased take:  1. Malik Beasley 2. Anthony Edwards 3. Jaylen Nowell 4. Zach LaVine 5. Malik Beasley again
malik beasley
"KAT was out for a month atleast this season due to injury and covid protocols, Russell also was out for 6 weeks atleast due to surgery. The Timberwolves haven’t had much luck when it comes to injuries. Malik Beasley also got suspended for 12 games. Their roster was already quite weak, but the Wolves also can’t do much about injuries and protocols."
Don’t forget Malik Beasley too
Malik Beasley over Wall/Ant probably
"Hmm.. actually John Wall + Eric Gordon + Jerami Grant + Christian Wood + KAT is a very solid starting 5 with plenty of athleticism, shooting &amp; versatility. DLo, Terrance Ross, Ant Edwards, Malik Beasley coming off the bench gunning threes.. or Gary Harris and Otto Porter if they're healthy in this scenario  Idk about championship but it'd be a pretty nasty team in the East. Probably 4th seed ahead of Atl and behind Phi/Bkn/Mil"
Malik Beasley is a scrub now? And even if you didn’t count him this is still impressive as a third option rookie
"But people put way more expectations on Dlo that there should have been. When Dlo got the max, he was expected to be a 2nd option playing next to Steph. Of course Steph gets injured a few games in so it's basically Dlo and mostly rookies and G-leaguers he has to play with.   He comes to Minnesota and KAT is injured for a lot of games. He ends up being on a team where the 2nd best player is Malik Beasley. It's no surprise once KAT came back the Twolves were doing very well offensively."
Malik Beasley
"&gt;Regardless, I could just as easily point at all the $13M bargains in this league.  Marcus Smart, Malik Beasley, Covington, Warren...  How much worse is Kuzma compared to the players you mentioned?   Smart hasn't given you the elite defense this year and is as bone-headed as Kuzma on the offensive end. Which is why he is also in trade rumors all year long but didn't get the interest that Ainge wanted. Malik Beasley and Warren are good offensive players and more efficient than Kuzma, yes, but they are a significant downgrade on the defensive end.  Covington, I do agree is a better player than Kuzma and is a bargain at his contract, but the Blazers needed to trade 2 first round picks to get him. You don't need to do that for Kuzma."
"Joseph was a bad contract.  Winslow can't stay healthy and isn't sniffing $13M again.  Kennard is a lethal shooter which carries a premium.   Regardless, I could just as easily point at all the $13M bargains in this league.  Marcus Smart, Malik Beasley, Covington, Warren...  Bottom line is that like many young guys in this price range Kuzma was given $13M in the hopes that he'd grow into something more, and he's failed to do that.  His contract isn't some massive albatross, but it's a solid overpay, and teams are not going to be itching to give up something *better* than Kuzma for Kuzma."
Perhaps Timberwolve malik beasley
I inferred based on:  &gt; When their core 3 were healthy they were playing at what was essentially a 50 win pace and that was without Malik Beasley  I suppose I shouldn't have
"For 2016, Malik Beasley is in the convo. He's better than Herro. 20/4/2 on 45/39/82 at 24yo aint shabby at all. Give him starter minutes and I could see him having some season over the next 6 years with 25ppg and an all star nod"
"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
"No I get it, but I’m just saying it shouldn’t even be a conversation. Even players like Duncan Robinson or Malik Beasley are leagues ahead of Kuzma"
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14.

Malik Beasley
"Denver took Malik Beasley, who averaged 20 points a game with the Wolves this season, with that pick"
"Reading though the list of signings and trades he's made since starting with the Blazers makes me irrationally angry. He has a good read on guard talent in the draft but aside from that he's been about worthless.   This one really gets me riled up.   February 19, 2015: Traded Will Barton, Victor Claver, Thomas Robinson and a 2016 1st round draft pick (Malik Beasley was later selected) to the Denver Nuggets for Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee. (DEN 2016 1st round pick received from POR is lottery protected.)"
They got Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee. The Nuggets selected Malik Beasley with that pick
Sign and trade scroeder for Malik Beasley
"I think his fit in Minnesota is probably the best. Minnesota trades Malik Beasley and Rubio probably so you get something like a KAT, Edwards, DLo, Simmons core 4. I like Simmons a lot in the offense. There’s some spacing/shooting and it’ll be an offense that can run. Simmons will not be the only ball handler initiator either. Defensively he’d definitely help and hopefully could at least improve their defense to passable. That all being said idk if Philly wants Beasley/Rubio/picks for Simmons."
"I mean that did happen, but that comment specifically was a joke about Malik Beasley smashing Larsa."
I mean I myself don’t have proof but I know it happened for sure because Malik Beasley and his wife kept beefing on ig with their stories and then Malik apologized and stuff so yeah
"PG- Malcolm Brogdan SG- Collin Sexton SF-Jaylen Brown PF-Jae Crowder C-Dwight Howard Bench:  Antony Edward, Derrick Favors, Malik Beasley, Wendell Carter  Overall team ga wouldn't be bad, especially if Dwight was back in prime form."
Malik Beasley cheated on his wife w/ Larsa Pippen
I think the comment was in reference to Malik Beasley smashing ScottieJr.’s mom
"If we’re doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We’re lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can’t think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I’m leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
"I think Rubio lands in Toronto and Lowry lands in Philly. Fwiw Beasley is out of jail and he is a 39.9% 3point shooter. I don’t think he is a negative asset at all, and as much as I’d like Simmons part of me selfishly wants to keep Malik threesley for the Arby’s French dips."
"Simmons is also not really the right personality for Philly. He is kind of passive and more of a shoulder shrug type guy that just is gonna keep pissing off the Philly fans. The trade is strange because Simmons is losing trade value for Philly because there is no way to convince the fans that just running it back is gonna be a good idea after the way they went out in the playoffs, but at the same time Simmons received an MVP vote last year so you can't just let him go just to shake it up. Simmons probably NEEDS to leave but the Sixers probably aren't getting equal value back unless it is multiple trades.   Here is the trade idea I have seen kicked around the Wolves sub.   Raptors-Wolves-Sixers.  Raptors get Naz Reid and Ricky Rubio  Wolves get Simmons and Baynes.   Sixers get Malik Beasley, Kyle Lowry and 2 Wolves 1sts.   Raptors do it to get the veteran leader in Rubio to come in and hopefully mentor Suggs (Mitchell and Edwards have both raved about how good Rubio is at helping them get up to NBA speed), also as an expiring they can restock next year they can possibly flip him. They get a super team friendly contract in Naz who has shown flashes and they get to not play Baynes anymore. Giving up Lowry is just a S+T so the cost to them is minimal to be part of the trade.   Wolves get their guy in Simmons, take on the Baynes contract and maybe he can show better here than he did in his disaster season in Tampa.   Sixers get a real PG that they can trust to take big shots and they get a knockdown shooter to help create space for Embiid. Curry doesn't need to be the only threat beyond the arc if they add Beasley. The 2 1st can be packaged together with some of the Sixers other assets or picks if they decide they need to make another run at a star like Beal."
sixers fans can i interest you in a malik beasley per chance
"Since Siakam seems to be on the table for the right deal, how would this look for all involved?   Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Malik Beasley  Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Ricky Rubio  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Some number of Sixers 1sts (1-4). Maybe two of them?   Sixers get a star wing who can score plus a microwave 20ppg scoring guard.   Timberwolves turn their backup guards and a young prospect into Ben Simmons, who fills all the holes in their starting lineup. DLo/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a damn solid core.   Raptors flip Pascal for a haul - a great prospect (McDaniels), two good prospects Thybulle, Maxey), a veteran PG who can replace Lowry or come off the bench (Rubio), and some pick(s) from the Sixers."

"&gt;No one cares       Are you sure no one cares when Tristan Thompson, Danuel House and Malik Beasley are sleeping around?"
Rubio + Malik Beasley + a 2024 first.
*who* is more accurate and thats Nuggets legend Malik Beasley
Imagine he has to end up playing with Malik Beasley during his career.
"Beyond Jamal Murray a healthy Kemba Walker but that's alas a thing of the past and you saw how a diminished Kemba hurt Boston in this regard. Lowry would help in that he moves off ball better, has real gravity from 3(unlike Jrue) and is a better passer but still feels like they need a more creative dynamic scorer. Lowry is 80% 3s+layups for shit profile and not a consistent half court scorer as is.  But alas this is also the issue finding a guy to do all these things, and Lowry would still help youre right. If we're thinking lesser non all star versions of this guys like Kevin Huerter, Collin Sexton, Malik Beasley, Devonte Graham, Goran Dragic, Tim Hardaway. The only of those guys though who might even be remotely realistic is Graham, who will help but at some point if you can only shoot 44% at the rim that's so detrimental in a playoff setting it might just entirely cancel out whatever benefits he provides."
"*After a key of cocaine, Elton leaned over to Gerrson and softly whispered ""I want you right here, right now."" Gerron slowly undressed, caressed Elton's throbbing manhood, and inserted it into his mouth. Elton then turned Rosas over on his stomach, and proceeded to roughly penetrate Gerrson's anus. After a minute, they both screamed and climaxed.*  *The next morning Ben Simmons was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Ricky Rubio, Malik Beasley, and 3 first round picks, with a pick swap.*  --END CREDITS--"
"Malik Beasley is a pretty good asset. 20ppg scorer on good efficiency, elite shooter, extremely athletic, only 24. Add in like 2-3 first round picks and some young upside project players like Culver, Nowell, Vanderbilt, and thats not a bad trade package. Simmons at this point on a max contract probably isn't getting an insane return especially since he'd have trouble fitting on most teams."
Core 4? Who’s the 4th player? Malik Beasley 😂? It’s a 2 player core so anyone who isn’t Edwards or KAT is available. I get wanting to hold on to D’Lo but he’s not staying in a Simmons trade.
"Is there a three way trade to be had between the Wolves, Sixers, and Pacers where they all come out on top?  How's this for a three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcom Brogdon  * Malik Beasley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Pacers get:   * Ricky Rubio  * Tyrese Maxey  * Jarrett Culver  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts   Brogdon moves into the Sixers starting lineup as a hyper-efficient 20ppg point guard. Beasley gives microwave scoring off the bench, averaging 20ppg himself last season. Sixers offense gets superpowered by moving on from Simmons and giving up one of their three promising guard prospects to win now.   Timberwolves move their expensive backup guards, a bust that needs a change of scenery, and picks that probably won't be in the lottery for Ben Simmons, who slots right into their offense. DLo/Ant/Ben/McDaniels/KAT is sp00ky for real. Again on the picks - they don't need any more young prospects, so moving a few picks for better players, now, is a likely and sensible move.   Pacers move on from Brogdon to try to build for the future while continuing to make the playoffs, which is their MO. They get Rubio, who can start in Brogdon's slot. They get Maxey, a promising guard prospect. They get Culver, who's really just filler but is still only 22yo and could be a reclamation project. And they get two 1st round picks that, who knows, could still be pretty good picks, knowing the Wolves."

Nah.  Rubio Malik Beasley and picks.  If the Sixers are lucky....IF they may even get Naz Reid.  IF they ask nicely.
Malik Beasley is also in jail.
D'angelo Russel and Malik Beasley take it or leave it
"Oh for sure, classic haves vs have nots. Cheers, Twolves friend! I hope Malik Beasley turns it around, I always enjoyed him here!"
"I know the Ben Simmons rumours have been non-stop, but what do you think a fair trade package would be?  I reckon Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Ricky Rubio, 2022 2nd (via either 76ers or Nuggets) and 2023 lottery protected 1st would be more than reasonable. Philly get their pass first point guard, a scoring wing and a combo of prospects and picks.  Starting line-up of Towns, Simmons, Okogie/Culver, Edwards and Russell is pretty decent and a low seed playoff squad for sure."
&gt; Gasol probably leaves  lol he's under contract for this next year @ 2.7 mil. Bargain.  &gt; Trade: Kuzma/22nd pick for Malik Beasley  MIN says fuck off  &gt; Something like the below squad could win it all  no
I spent way too much time looking for Malik Beasley.
"Agreed, you get Malik Beasley and we get Jayson Tatum"
LeBron and AD for Rubio and Malik Beasley. It’s only fair.
"Well as I said you have to balance the salaries and as I didn’t go into depth it would take the Wolves adding Malik Beasley to get equal salaries of Beasley and Rubio to match Simmons (about 30m), also depends on what size contract Lowry could ask for. Toronto want to do Lowry a solid but getting Bolmaro, a pick and Rubio who can either start or be a veteran influence and then be flipped for another piece seems decent enough. 76ers getting Kyle Lowry and Malik Beasley might be enough to get the deal done."
Free Malik Beasley
"Some guys are definitely empty stats players though. For instance Malik Beasley and Jerami Grant. They’re great guys for tanking but if they put up 20 ppg on “contending” teams, those teams wouldn’t actually be contenders anymore."
she’s the girl that was caught fucking around with  Malik Beasley a few months back
"If my ex was getting piped by Future and Malik Beasley and this was all being made public, I would definitely feel some type of way about it lol"
"His wife is 46, getting publicly piped by Future and Malik Beasley while getting into ig drama with the BM.  And Scotties part of that generation thats too hard to be sad, so this is end result."
His wife cheated on him with malik Beasley
"Minnesota gets: Ben Simmons    Philly gets: Kyle Lowry, Malik Beasley, Ricky Rubio, Minnesota 1st   Toronto gets: Minnesota 1st     lets do it"
Malik Beasley pointed a gun at a family because they parked in front of his house. 12 game suspension.
Thought this said Malik Beasley for a min and now i’m even more confused
Why does every supposed Warrior trade have them giving multiple firsts? This one for...checks notes...Malik Beasley! And the former number 2 pick. Smdh at fan trades
Malik Beasley gotta be on the list
Malik Beasley gun charge
With Malik Beasley aswell.
his wife is also fucking Malik Beasley and likely several dudes from NBA twitter
"Something like:  Philly gets: Lowry (S&amp;T @ ~$25 mil per year)+ Malik Beasley + '22 or 24' 1st from Min  Toronto gets: Rubio (expring and would be a mentor for Suggs) + Okogie (salary matching) + '22 or 24' 1st from Min  Minnesota gets: Simmons  The teams would have to negotiate who gets which year's 1st, and what the protections are."
Don’t forget Malik Beasley
"Also, I believe his wife of around 20 years divorced him, started dating Malik Beasley, and has otherwise gone full Kardashian."
Beasley fam. Imagine see your mom with Malik Beasley when your dad is Scottie Pippen
"wolfson is a pretty good follow in case you like to have general tabs on the league for non-wolves fans  i like this fit actually. simmons, russell, and towns is a good core plus ant their dynamic scorer.   rubio makes too much to be a backup for philly but malik beasley is a great fit. minny has to flip picks and their B/C level prospects with rubio for something that helps philly win now but i’m not sure who that is."
We need Malik Beasley to do a MV of ‘Scotty Doesn’t Know’ while in jail. And then have Chuck bring it up on Inside the NBA
"Wolves: Simmons Philly: Malik Beasley, Lowry, twolves first  Tor: Rubio + wolves first"
Pippen really taking all the L's lately. Imagine your wife being seducted by Malik Beasley.
"Malik Beasley is exactly who you need, hes a hyper efficient shooter like Seth who can light it up. If you had him in the ESF you wouldve advanced instead of Embiid.  Dlo would also be way better offensively in the playoffs than Ben could."
"Wonder if they could pull off a 3-way trade with Toronto &amp; Philly. Something like:   - Wolves get: Simmons / George Hill (for cap purposes), 76ers 2021 1st #28  - 76ers get: Kyle Lowry (S&amp;T), Malik Beasley, Best of Wolves/Raptors 2022 1st round picks.   - Toronto gets: Ricky Rubio, Josh Okogie, Worst of Wolves/Raptors 2022 1st round picks."
Wolves get Ben Simmons  Knicks get Anthony Edwards.. Malik Beasley.. picks  Sixers get Julius Randle  Who says no?
"Malik Beasley, Juancho, and some pick compensation lol"
Malik Beasley and Bronny James ruined this man
Read these comments. People act like getting Lowry and Malik Beasley would be a disappointing outcome for the sixers
The idea being you trade Malik Beasley for Ben Simmons. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah buddy this isn’t gonna work out
Wolves fans keep putting Malik Beasley in mock trades but we don’t know if his parole officer will sign off on him leaving the state
Malik Beasley having a hell of a year
"Additionally, after our top 3 or 4 shooters, our shooting ability drops off immensely.  *With* D'Lo, Simmons being an offensive +0 isn't as much of an issue, because we wouldn't need him to score as much behind KAT, Ant, and D'Lo.  *Without* D'Lo, our next best shooters are (currently in jail) Malik Beasley, Rubio every other game, and Nowell, who has shown flashes but is still really inconsistent. Simmons would need to be option #3 behind Ant and KAT, and while Ant has been trending in the right direction, he's not as consistent a 3pt shooter as D'Lo just yet."
"&gt; Tbf Saddiq Bey looks way better than your typical #19 pick  actually not as it turns out lmfao. 19 is the most loaded non lotto pick spot this decade somehow. Huerter, Collins, Tobias and Gary Harris, Malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley all 19th overall lmao.  Bey is a gem though, Detroit has a bright future."
"Tbf it was Bey and he was literally a first team rookie. Hell half the last 19th picks in the last decade are prolly better picks than bagley. Huerter, Collins, Tobias Harris, Gary Harris, malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley."
Does he have something to say about Malik Beasley fucking his wife
"Malik Beasley, Rubio, 2023 top 5 protected 1st and pick swaps next year."
D LO + Malik Beasley seems about right.
What about his assessment of malik beasley ?
Kevin Durant gives blunt assessment of Scottie Pippen: 'He doesn't have what future or Malik Beasley have'
Future fucked Malik Beasley?!?
Malik Beasley gucci flip flops.
Malik Beasley too
"Scottie: Ur fat  Chuck: I'll fite u  Scottie: U only fight white guys or during basketball matches  Chuck: Malik Beasley  Everyone: Hey Scottie, remember playing with Jordan?"
"Watch out Scottie, chuck gonna roast u for your wife hanging with Malik fucking Beasley lol"
Simmons needs a change of scenery and doubts Embiid wants to play on the same team with him next year. Timberwolves don't have a pick and and could be a good place for him to go play PF next to KAT. Rubio + Malik Beasley + 1st rnd pick (Lottery protected) for Ben Simmons would get it done.
"First KCP, now Caruso. Are the Lakers gonna make a trade for Malik Beasley now?"
&amp;#x200B;  In no particular order:  1. LBJ 2. KD 3. Curry 4. Klay 5. AD 6. Kyrie 7. Harden 8. Joker 9. Booker 10. Murray 11. CP3 12. Luka 13. Giannis 14. Leonard 15. Dame 16. Embiid 17. Randle 18.

"I think it's been blown a bit out of proportions how bad he's been. Lowe suggested a Malik Beasley and D'Angelo Russell for Simmons trade and i'd take that in a heartbeat. Even with a pick included that trade still seems a bit lopsided.  He *really* shines in full court offense and there's less of that in the post season, but that shit helped them go 49-23 in the regular season and secure the 1st seed in the east."
Lol. So yeah this 1 year window you're talking about is when KAT missed 22 games and DLo missed 30. Not even including Malik Beasley missing 35 games.   You would have had an easier argument using literally any year but this one.
Am I reading this right? Kyrie got fined $1.6 million in January? Or was that just his loss of salary for missing 4 games? Either way that's an insane amount of money. Looks like Malik Beasley lost out on the same amount of money and probably can't take that hit as easily as Kyrie...
You're insane if you think Ben Simmons is worth a top 3 pick right now. Philly might trade him for Malik Beasley straight up.
"For background:   &gt; Beasley came out, pointed a rifle at the car, and told them to drive off.   https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/02/09/minnesotas-malik-beasley-sentenced-to-120-days-in-jail-for-felony-threats-of-violence/"
"Trade for Malik Beasley. Idk what they’d offer, but Malik is a solid scorer and might be the odd man out of the Wolves rotation."
"Hol up this is what I thought of  Wolves recieve: Ben Simmons  Sixers recieve: Malik Beasley and Kyle Lowry via sign and trade  Raptors recieve: Rubio,Culver and Wolves 2023 first"
"Someone who can pass the ball and defend, but doesnt take away the offense from the others, like Ricky Rubio, or a lights out shooter like Malik Beasley. Maybe a young up and coming prospect like Jarrett Culver"
Malik Beasley?
"honestly, Malik Beasley. Maliks not a bad defender, based on my 2k knowledge, and he isn't a defensive liability."
Who’s the best player you could get for Simmons right now straight up?  Malik Beasley? CJ?
Idk Rosas got Malik Beasley by trading Roco to Houston i trust him he'll think of something
Fuck the nuggets in this situation (sorry) Minnesota will give Malik Beasley Naz Reid 1 unprotected first  a top 5 protected first and a couple 2nds For Ben Simmons
"Lool this is gonna fuel Ant. Him and Kat gonna be modern Kob/Shaq, with Malik Beasley as their Horry and DLo as a Ty Lue/Derek Fisher hybrid.    Wolves gonna be lit next year."
"Well the hornets had a worse record with Ball playing than not…if we want to talk about impact on record. Also, I would think most people agree that KAT, DLO, and Malik Beasley missing is a bigger deal than Gordon."
Simmons for Minnesota 1st plus Rubio and Malik Beasley.
"Well I meant 7, but either way it's a high pick that will yield an elite prospect. If Dlo played the whole season without KAT I would hope he would average more than 19 if he's the number one option. Wiggins himself put up better numbers as the number one option in Minny. Either way Dlo was an inefficient low scoring first option who was a defensive liability while Wiggins was efficient and played great defense in his role. He helped us more than Dlo helped you, who was outplayed by Malik Beasley. Either way the pick makes it a fleece, but I respect the copium."
malik beasley?
"One passed away, the other publicly addressed his mom sleeping with Future and Malik Beasley."
"We keep:  * KAT * Anthony Edwards * DLo * Jaden McDaniels * Malik Beasley * Naz Reid * Rubio * Juancho  Honestly, any 2 of Rubio, Juancho, Vando, and Okogie can be kept, I just chose these 2 out of price."
"definitely that too. A player like Malik Beasley whom we coveted was just yet another young talent on your team, so much so that you have to pick and choose between them sometimes re: who gets the contracts. It sounds like a great problem to have lol"
For real. They had so much surplus young talent that we basically got Malik Beasley out of it lol. I'd kill to be in that position
"The surrounding cast is really not as bad as people think, Malik Beasley is a a great shooter, Big Mac might be the steal of the draft, Naz is one of the best backup centers in the league, Rubio, Vanderbilt, and Nowell are all decent to good rotational pieces. All this team needs is a true power forward"
Portland and Sacramento will be suitors to look at for Porzingis. Porzingis for Buddy Hield + whatever to make contracts match. Hield probably doesn't want to be there. Porzingis for CJ McCullom. Looks like the Blazers want to move McCullom. There's probably others out there but those are the ones that come to mind from the get go. Minny perhaps. Malik Beasley and other junk for Porzingis. Pelicans maybe.
"Absolutely 100000% she finessed it. At that age a 5 year age gap is actually fairly significant, they never even overlapped in highschool. She definately has power in that relationship.  Its funny how Tyler is the one who will inevitably be critcized for going after an IG girl, when in reality he's barely an adult and being preyed upon by older females. Same shit with Malik Beasley and Larsa Pippen, these guys need guidance man."
"If I'm Portland I'm asking who they got besides DLo. Can't we do a 1st, Ant-Man, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, and Rubio's expiring for salary matching so I don't have to take DLo at 30 million for 2 year?, That way if I am blowing things up by giving up Dame I have a clear path to fix my salary table, and have good contracts to go after the next star that becomes available. At that point Ant is the franchise player and I'm shopping CJ and RoCo with picks and those plus contacts to get someone like Beal or a disgruntled star. I'm keeping Nurkic for now and seeing if he will extend for around the same salary."
"Wolves are giving up too much.  I don’t know if the salaries align, but Edwards + Malik Beasley may work."
Granny got them Malik Beasley vibes
"I mean they can, Lebron was leading them just fine.   I’m hoping they can find trades using draft picks to get someone like Malik Beasley or give a contract to Nurkic.   A younger offensive player"
I wonder if Malik Beasley really goes around talking like a 1920s mobster
Malik Beasley
"Pretty incredible how deep they are even after losing Malik Beasley, Plumblee, Grant, and Torrey Craig."
"Even crazier when you realize we've also drafted/signed really good quality players in Malik Beasley, Torrey Craig and Huancho who we just didn't have the money to keep around. Not sure how we keep replacing guys but it's nice. Pretty sure Hampton is gonna wind up to be a good player too, but I'm fine with giving up him to get AG.  Also nailed it with the Jerami Grant trade last year. Acquiring PJ Dozier was clutch too. I thought we were gonna take a dip in that department when Masai left but we really haven't missed a beat."
how about Malik Beasley from Minnesota via trade?
"I don’t think Malik Beasley would stop them from getting Jaylen Brown lol  Not that they’d do that trade in the first place, but still."
"Going to be hard to unload Kemba's deal. As a wolves fan, I would love to deal Malik Beasley and assets for Marcus smart"
Agreed. The Nuggets are a development powerhouse. MPJ. Murray Jokic! Even players like Gary Harris looked fantastic before injuries. and Malik Beasley is a good player
You can have 1 Malik Beasley for 2 1sts
Malik Beasley and Rubio for KP
"Imo not many GMs picking in the lottery believe they can get zero return on a lotto pick investment for 2 years and it not affect their job security.   Also not a lot of teams in the lottery that were overloaded and selling low on solid young guys at the time. We traded Juancho and Malik Beasley for straight up peanuts at around the same time. To word that another way: when the Nuggets drafted MPJ, there was a negligible difference in value between that pick turning into a replacement-level starter down the line or never playing in the NBA at all."
Malik Beasley and 2 1st round picks
Malik Beasley is by far the wildest dude in the NBA he doesn’t get the recognition he deserves
&gt; Why is this necessary at all??  Because Malik Beasley pointed a loaded rifle at a family parked on the street looking for an open house.
Malik Beasley got arrested.
I'd like that but we don't have anyone that we want to trade and that the Mavs would like in return.   Unless they'd like Malik Beasley lol
"We have 1 Malik Beasley available. Looking for a defensive PF, also I would want G back becauseI still &lt;3 him. Also no takebacks if Beasley does dumb shit."
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
"When I saw Porter Jr was below Halliburton and Malik Beasley, I was about to upset then I saw MPJ up higher and was calm"
Here's my top 5 protected when taking contracts into consideration.  1. Karl Anthony Towns  2. Anthony Edwards  3. D'Angelo Russell  4. Jaden McDaniels  5. Malik Beasley
"Hell, Poeltl, Juancho Hernangomez, Malik Beasley, Zubac, Niang all would have been better picks than the guys they took"
"Believe it or not, I actually agree.   They’re 13-11 when Ant, D’Lo and KAT all play and they’ll likely get even better they can keep their pick. Not to mention they have good depth with key pieces like Malik Beasley (who missed half the season), Rubio and McDaniels.  I can definitely see Minnesota making somewhat of a push for the playoffs especially if they can keep their pick, but that’s a pretty big if since they only have a 27.6% chance of keeping that pick. (At the same time, it isn’t looking too bad for Minnesota considering that their end-of-season push likely pushed their pick outside the top 5)"
"We are paying Malik Beasley 60/4 who is about the same level of player as DS.   If you overpay players thats fine but don't justify it by saying its ""normal""."
"Dallas didn’t decide to rest until they were getting blown out. I’d say that’s a legit win. And it’s not like other people aren’t playing against tanking teams, not to mention Malik Beasley and DLO missed big chunks of that stretch"
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1. Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Brandon Ingram - 24  **Most games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. James Harden - 16 2. Malik Beasley - 15 3. Caris LeVert, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks - 13  **Fewest games as top scorer - best on team**  1. John Wall - 20 2. Pascal Siakam - 21 3.

Andre Drummond, Khris Middleton - 8  **Fewest games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. Rui Hachimura - 3 2. Carmelo Anthony, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Orlando Magic - 4"
"Surprises for me were Josh Jackson, Malik Beasley, and Caris Levert (filling in his role so quickly in IND)."
"Just for some context.  Started the year with Ryan Saunders.  In the second game of the season we lost KAT to a dislocated wrist (6-8 weeks estimated healing)  About two weeks ahead of schedule, KAT willed himself to play with one wrist. Not even two games later KAT got covid and was out for another 2 weeks.   By the time KAT got back, DLO got surgery.  Also around this time Malik Beasley got suspended for his off court shenanigans.  When Beasley’s suspension ended, he got surgery."
"D'lo/Ant/Beasley/Nowell, so we basically had 3 SG's and no backup PG unless we wanted to bring back McLaughlin.  This way we get a very good backup PG and someone who is suited for the role of 6th man unlike Malik. Also the hope is Nowell eventually learns the ropes of being a PG."
Yea well we have JR Smith Jr in Malik Beasley so just you wait til we get there!!  (Unless we trade him…)
What did Malik Beasley do?
"I don't for the most part, but it's hard to watch Malik Beasley or Karl Malone or Jason Kidd knowing what caliber of human being they actually are."
Alex Caruso  Malik Beasley  Josh Jackson  Rodions Kurucs  Richaun Holmes
"The likely scenario would probably be:  Lillard, Malik Beasley and Pat Bev to the Sixers    Simmons to Minnesota   2022 unprotected FRP (Sota)   2022 top 3 protected FRP (Sixers)   2023 Pick swap (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected FRP (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected pick (Sixers)   Tyrese Maxey   Paul Reed   Matisse Thybulle   Jaden Springer   Naz Reid    To the Blazers. Four firsts, a swap and four young talented cheap players (albeit no potential super stars).  They then trade McCollum for another good first or two decent firsts and start over."
"im sure the sixers are banging down the door for malik ""just gotta outta jail let me take a photo shoot"" beasley"
Lol. Yeah. I’m trolling. But I mean well at heart. I actually really like Malik Beasley. His off court shit needs to be settled and calmed down. But he’s a damn bucket.
Mavs will be your third team. Take Dwight Powell and Stein. Wolves send us Malik Beasley. Dudes a bucket.
"Still who do the TWolves have to trade? Recently released malik beasley? They are already over the salary cap so they will have to move either Ant, KAT or DLo to make any deal work."
"Minnesota thinking they can get Simmons without giving up Ant, Dlo or McDaniels is one of the funniest storylines I’ve ever seen.  They’re not going to get Simmons or any win now pieces to trade for him with a deal centered around Taurean Prince and All-Prison first team members Pat Bev and Malik Beasley"
"So, you're saying that (using the 2001 team as an example) Wally Szczerbiak, pre-Detroit Chauncey Billups, and Rasho Nesterovic are 27 games better than D'Angelo Russell, Ricky Rubio, and Malik Beasley?  Come on."
"KAT is decent on D these days, it's just that the rest of his team (and he himself) are perpetually injured or on absence (or arrested if you're Malik Beasley)    Centers are much more dependent on the rest of their team, they didn't even have guys capable of throwing an entry pass before last season, let alone run a set offense. Jokic avoids this problem because he's the greatest passing big man in NBA history, Embiid still has Simmons to set up the offense and has had better teams too (And is a DPOY caliber player)"
"I just don't get how a team with KAT, Ant, D'Lo, and Malik Beasley isn't a solid team."
"The Wolves were above .500 when Towns and Russell played together. Last year Towns missed 22 games and was slow coming back from COVID, DLo missed 30, and Malik Beasley missed 35. I’m not saying we will be great but last year went about as bad as it possibly could have in terms of luck."
Malik Beasley is young and thirsty for Larsa pippin
Malik Beasley will definitely play a large role in this trade
"Simmons to Minnesota, Lillard to Philly, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, 4 1sts from Philly and Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, 2 1sts from Minny to Portland"
Announce Simmons to the Timberwolves for Pat Bev and Malik Beasley.
[yeah](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/more-sports/charges-timberwolves-malik-beasley-threatened-family-with-gun-outside-his-home-pot-stash-found-inside/ar-BB1avXyk) it’s astounding lol.   &gt; Officers detected an overwhelming odor of marijuana and soon located more than 1¾ pounds of the drug in the basement living room and main floor office. Next to the stash was a notebook with instructions on how to smoke the drug.
If you think DAngelo Russell is good you will think Malik Beasley is good too
Malik Beasley had several pounds of weed along with *instructions on how to smoke it*. He’s dumb.
malik beasley alone is amazingly talented if he ever gets his head straightened out
"&gt;Philadelphia gets:  &gt;Anthony Edwards &gt;Malik Beasley &gt;Jaden McDaniels  This has to be trolling, right? Nobody is this dumb."
"Right I said that but the initial offer was with Pat Bev as the ""best piece,"" and even with Beasley, no that isn't enough to move the needle for the Sixers. Sorry but no, Simmons is worth more than Beasley + PatBev *plus* a negative contract in Prince *plus* picks that is useless to a team with Embiid. Like I said, Beasley + picks would have to be flipped for a genuine player.  Sixers fans are not going to get excited as Malik Beasley as a trade package's best player.  If that's all it took, Simmons would already be wearing another uniform"
"Jarrett Culver? That’s a great high risk - low reward gamble. The guy is a great ball handler and has strong ball iq and can bail out and run the offense as a secondary creator when teams dial up on Ja Morant. He’s also a great team defender and wing defender. I believe the Minnesota Timberwolves were a bad a situation for him. They had DeAngelo Russell, Malik Beasley, and ANT at the guard/forward spots. That’s also excluding Okogie. That team was very unbalanced and Culver was a casualty.   He also dealt with injuries and I think his jump shot will recover. He was a 70% ft shooter and shot at least 2 attempts/game in 3 pointers. He’s not trash guys. Trust me. He was in a bad situation in Minnesota. They had a very unbalanced lineup and was forced to play to his weaknesses."
"In the last few years Minnesota has turned Kevin Love, Zach Lavine, and 4 lottery picks into D-LO, Malik Beasley, ~~Ricky Rubio~~ Taurean Prince, and ~~Jarret Culver~~ Pat Bev."
"What’s the Wolves projected starting 5? I saw Malik Beasley was released today, so I assume DLo, Beasley, Ant, and KAT. Who’s the 5th? Mcdaniels ?"
"Id try to force a trade to 6ers, essentially forcing the Blazers to rebuild, which means they wouldn't want Simmons, so a third team that really wants a defensive pf who won't take touches away from players will have to be involved in this completely hypothetical and unbiased trade. If I was the Blazers FO, I would get rid of McCollum obviously, but I would need draft picks and some young players who haven't hit their stride, someone like, idk, Jarrett Culver, maybe a shooter and an ok pf, like, Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince maybe? That's just what seems fair and unbiased to me."
"Who knows what they'd do - Jody Allen is apparently trying to sell the Blazers and it's easier to sell a competitive team (probably).  I imagine if the Blazers are blowing it up they'd clear house for all of the picks they can. Here's the rough deal:  Philly gets: Either Dame/CJ, Robert Covington  Minny gets: Ben Simmons  Portland gets: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, picks from BOTH Philly and Minny"
"I think Malik Beasley can follow a similar trajectory as Beal. He's already quite good but what really made Beal take the jump getting to the free throw line and making shots off the dribble, which Beasley has shown signs of being able to do."
"Cam Reddish, ppl sleeping on him b/c he got injured this year, him and malik beasley are secret superstars."
Malik Beasley
"Malik Beasley, If he can stop fucking himself over.  Dude just got buckets before suspension last year"
"Malik Beasley. Only 24 still, has produced ever since he's received starter's minutes in Minnesota. He's a sniper too. last year 40% 3pt on 9.7 a game"
"Sure but to not even make the honorable mention??? That's kinda crazy to believe. Feels like a conspiracy at this point.  &gt;The other players who received votes for this exercise but just missed the cut to make the Top 25 are OG Anunoby (Toronto), Tyrese Haliburton (Sacramento), Lauri Markkanen (Chicago), De’Andre Hunter (Atlanta), Malik Beasley (Minnesota), Immanuel Quickley (New York) and Jalen Brunson (Dallas)."
"* I could see Malik Beasley hit 25ppg with everyone on the Wolves healthy.  * Derrick White could have had a breakout season last year but couldn't get healthy.   * Jalen Brunson is really good, but maybe we won't see him flourish until he leaves the Mavs.  * Maybe not MIP, but TJ Warren will have another excellent and totally ignored season. 20ppg on 60 TS%.  * Nickeil Alexander Walker will have some massive games, but struggle with consistency.  * If we are allowed sophmores, I think Haliburton and Patrick Williams will have big leaps. Maybe Aaron Nesmith and Devin Vassell."
You’re acting like kais first dunk was past Malik Beasley with the pass fake and on Kenneth Faried’s head not typical summer league players but yea I don’t expect Kai to be a big contributor for a bit but he’s like the type of athlete with fluidity that most 6-11-7ft guys just don’t have   Sengun is the other end of the spectrum really skilled fundementally but not nearly as freak of an athlete  If Kai gets enough PT this year he’ll prolly have a few of these in the regular season because as undeveloped as he is the flashes he shows are extremely difficult to defend  But you’re def right that you can’t draft a top 10 of out the gate they need time to develop
"So Taurean Prince, Malik Beasley and 2 1sts? We will even throw a Prince Prince jersey."
Here is what I'd be willing to give up but idk about other Wolves fans. I'd give up:  Malik Beasley Jaden Mcdaniels Juancho Hernangomez 2 first round picks.  That would be the highest I'd probably go.
At least D'Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley. Probably + picks or young players?
"Not sure who I'd even want from the Spurs. Dejounte Murray is a worse/shorter PG version of Simmons.  From the Timberwolves, not sure if D'Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley move the needle for their cost. I don't think Russell is a 16 game player."
"Minnesota is not giving up KAT or Ant in any deal for at least 2 more seasons. It only works if Portland is ready to go in a full on rebuild with picks. The ""stars"" of the deal for Portland would be Jaden McDaniels and probably Leandro Bolmaro, then probably Malik Beasley and Juancho and whatever else to make the numbers work. From there, they'd get a metric ton of picks and I'm sure they could demand one of the better prospects from the 76ers as well. The team giving away the best player almost never wins, unfortunately."
"Terence Davis, Malik Beasley, Jaxson Hayes, Ron Artest, Jason Kidd. Lol and that's not even NFL yet"
"It's like 3 years in a row I'm thinking KAT will take that leap into top 10 player status and with Anthony Edwards coming on strong, Malik Beasley playing more, D'Angelo Russell scoring the ball, and hopefully some development from other young players I think they'll be in the playoffs/play-in.  I will probably be wrong again, but I just love KAT and really do think he's a top 10 player surrounded by trash."
"Nuggets for Harris, Plumlee, Malik Beasley and a pick?   Definitely worse than the Toronto trade but Harris had higher value at the time. Could also include MPJ if you think that's more fair, but then the Nuggets are giving up a lot for one year of Kawhi."
"Maybe this is just me, but when I think of low character guys I'm imagining assholes like Malik Beasley...players who behave way outside the norm. I always thought what Kawhi did was shitty from the Spurs perspective, but ""normal"" (for better or worse) in terms of what players of his caliber often do. He's not committing crimes or fighting on the court or some dumb shit like that, so I don't really see him as a ""low character"" person."
"Like I said, Grayson hasn't had the opportunity yet. And opportunity is what's separating them. Grayson was on the bench as a rookie in Utah. In Memphis, he was playing behind two SGs that fit much better with Ja.   This could be a Malik Beasley situation of a scoring guard that was buried behind depth. And on a team with more opportunity, could become much more."
Like Malik Beasley?
Bryce James + DS for Malik Beasley?
Malik beasley
"I’m imagining it’d be DLo, Naz Reid (good backup center), picks, and maybe Malik Beasley. Then Philly can move the Wolves picks + their own picks for further upgrades.   Could 2-3 wolves picks and someone like Thybulle net you Jeremi Grant or Harrison Barnes? I’m not sure exactly what trade they’d make next, but I think you could do a lot with DLo, Curry, Thybulle, Harris, Embiid, and 10+ draft picks (7 from Philly and at least 3 from T-Wolves).   There’s no single move for Simmons (except Lillard) that makes the 76ers an sure-fire contender. As a result, I think they need to find a couple moves. Plus, I think DLo and Embiid fit really well together."
"The Wolves are one of the few teams that can make Simmons shine. The problem with Simmons is that you need to surround him with 4 shooters, but he can’t really play Center. That means you need a shooting Center if you want Simmons to thrive.   KAT is the greatest shooting center of all time, but not a great defender. That should make him and Simmons a great fit. Anthony Edwards is also really good at iso scoring, so he could get buckets in the clutch.   If they can keep McDaniels and/or Beasley, then the Wolves can run a starting lineup of:  Anthony Edwards (33% 3pt as a rookie), Malik Beasley (40% 3pt), Jalen McDaniels (36% 3pt as a rookie), Simmons and KAT (40% 3pt).   That’s pretty deadly."
Malik Beasley
"I'd definitely take Malik Beasley, although our frontcourt is thin. He got caught for what, weed? Pish posh, ain't a thing."
Does Malik Beasley work out? Or is he still in jail?
"Every player's absolute floor is 'so bad he is out of the league before his rookie contract is up'.  Most people are referring to the low end of the scenarios that seem realistic.    That said, I do think Lavine is too high, and it should be more like Jordan Clarkson or Malik Beasley or something like that."
I could see Malik Beasley contributing on a good team as a starter forsure
Malik Beasley and DLo are constantly in and out of line ups...
Sounds like I decided we’re calling Malik Beasley Malik edwards just now times like these call for radical innovations
"Malik Beasley played for a while after pleading guilty and before his suspension, I guess it’s up to the organization whether to play him or not but I don’t think that goes against any NBA rules"
No. he's a 6'3 SG. He's the new Malik Beasley  Pros: He was one of the best scorers in college basketball last year  Cons: He's a 6'3 SG
Tell me you don't watch Malik Beasley play without telling me you don't watch Malik Beasley play...
"This is why Minnesota seems like such a good fit for him, with Towns as a legit stretch 5. Maybe they trade 5 firsts and Malik Beasley for him and just go for it with Towns-Simmons-SF-Edwards-Russell as a starting 5."
Lol Malik Beasley and filler is too much if anything
"We have Malik Beasley, Okogie, and Jaylen Nowell as well. Beasley is a fantastic shooter and Jaylen is proving he deserves minutes - Okogie is just a defense guy, but what I’m trying to say is there are only so many minutes to go around at the 2 spot."
" Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and two timberwolves FRPs  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
"If it comes to that, then I’m fine with it. I’d rather hold onto Ben than trade him for Malik Beasley and a 2nd.  It’s negotiating, I don’t get why people here are so offended by it, all 30 GMs do it. The only difference here is that it’s getting leaked."
" Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and a timberwolves FRP  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
"Right before the draft starts there is a three team trade between the sixers raptors and the timerwolves.  Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and the timberwolves FRP  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
"Why is Larry Nance Jr all of the sudden available?  Hes from Cleveland, is on a very team friendly contract, great locker room guy, has improved a ton since he got here...  The only negative really is he is a little injury prone, but I'm not sure Malik Beasley and filler is enough or not."
I wish we wouldn't give a shit about the weed part of this.  Fuck Malik Beasley for acting like a genuinely violent and insane person towards a family.  Weed shouldn't even be illegal.
Malik Beasley pointed an assault rifle at a family walking down the street outside his house and threatened to shoot them. Then when police searched his house he had 2 pounds of weed... You made it sound like he was caught driving on a suspended license or something lol
"Consider what happened with Malik Beasley, Hayes is gonna be okay. Likely won’t serve any prison time and will maybe have to be on a short probation."
These two incidents are enough for me to comfortably call him a head case lol I don’t need a thesis of information  Where there’s smoke there’s fire  Look at Malik Beasley
Prison time is definitely possible and even likely depending on the truth of these allegations.   Remember both KCP &amp; Malik Beasley were sent to jail for way less than assaulting a police officer and both of those guys have more money and more valuation to the NBA and to their teams.
Malik Beasley went to jail? I thought rich NBA players *didn't even get slaps on the wrist
"Malik Beasley and Culver. Nuff said, where do we sign"
"It's either the Timbs or the Kings. But at least the Timbs can save themselves with Edwards and KAT. I also think Malik Beasley is decent if he can straighten his personal life out.   The Kings are a clusterfuck. The only quality player they've been able to draft in the last 5 years is Fox (possibly Halliburton). Before that, the best player they drafted was Boogie Cousins, and they literally failed to get him any support ever and he was easily the best Big-Man in the league for several years."
Malik Beasley
"Look, I don't want to be harsh to you, you seem like you have good intentions but this isn't a good trade to say the least.  First, as a Warriors fan, we don't want CJ. At all. And we don't want to trade Wise for him.  Second, I do not care how good you think Simmons is, the Wolves are NOT trading Ant. He is untouchable.   Third, why on earth would the Blazers want 2 players who just finished their rookie season and Malik Beasley? They want to contend, no? And you've given up the salary to trade for a big name.   Fourth, WAIT HOLY SHIT DAME GETS TRADED TOO WHAT?  Fifth, salaries do not match."
"I think our best case scenario is that a star demands a trade and we make a three team deal.    An example of what I mean (you can swap out different teams and players, just showing a structure):  Minnesota:  Ben Simmons  Sixers:  Dame Lillard  Blazers:  Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and whole bunch of Minnesota and Philadelphia draft picks  This of course assumes that the blazers/Wizards/other team are going to blow up their roster and are in asset acquisition mode."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"Other decent draftees include Monte Morris, Malik Beasley"
"Malik Beasley  dude has a torch, averaged 20ppg on 40% shooting from three, nearly 9 attempts a game"
Malik Beasley
No BS? Thought of it today! My Malik Beasley Arby’s one I debated saving but I posted anyway
He thinks my flair is Malik Beasley but it’s actually a totally different person. Turns out OP is as stupid as MPJ.
"Culver is the only pick their new regime has blew lmao they’re 4/5 which is a great hit rate. Drafted Naz reid Jaylen nowell Edwards and McDaniels. Malik Beasley is already out of prison he was only there a couple weeks (and it was the offseason). Trading for dlo was good b/c their FO got rid of Wiggins. He’s just been injured which is bad luck and happens. They have a winning record when dlo and kat play. Also their FO Is pretty good, they got rid of dieng Wiggins Teague contracts in one season (nobody thought they could get rid of either and that it would take numerous first round picks attached)."
"* Too early to judge the new Rockets front office and their rebuild.  * Kings are trending up. Choosing Buddy over Bogdanovic is their only real fuck up the last couple of years.  The Bogi/Divencenzo trade was really good had it stood.  * Pelicans: Griffin is fucking horrible.    * Cavs: Koby Altman is even worse than David Griffin  * Timberwolves: A bottom 3 front office for sure.  They blew the Culver pick.  Got fleeced for Dlo, who can't even stay on the floor.  Malik Beasley doing a prison bid is another WTF.   Their best move so far has been winning the lottery."
He made each team he was om better. If kawhi didn't hit a once in a lifetime shot the 76ers would have gone to the ECF where they would have easily beat those Bucks. Jimmy had several games in the playoffs that year where he scored more than Simmons and embiid COMBINED. He got the heat to the finals and won 2 games against the lakers with 2 of his 5 starters injured. Meanwhile kat just shits the bed every year and can't make it to the playoffs despite having D Lo and Malik Beasley on his team
"""Tell me you know without telling me blah blah blah""  Ben Simmons is worth more than Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels. Feel free to be the GM tho, you guys would be super content with going 23-49 every year."
*Aggressively offers Malik Beasley once again*
"do not forget the wolves prevented sachin gupta from taking the gm job in houston, which is only proper if they intended to eventually promote him from within.  this is the eagles going with jalen hurts over carson wentz.  rosas (wentz) may be good but flawed in the leadership category.  whereas hurts (sanchin gupta) is highly regarded in the locker room and has talent that is respected by many front office executives around the league.  also consider, four years ago, the timberwolves ownership stepped in to trade jimmy butler away when their general manager was not making headway.  it was said mulltiple times this offseason, the minnesota timberwolves were going to improve at the powerforward position via trade, and they got nobody.  had they gotten larry nance, they would'nt be in a standoff with philadelphia over ben simmons.  may we also recall that not only did anthony edwards fall into minnesota's lap, because they surprisingly got the #1 pick, but also that edwards was not considered a great fit in minnesota because they already had d'angelo russell and malik beasley scoring off the dribble.  meanwhile, the fact that the wolves already have in d'angelo russell what the sixers wanted from markelle fultz in terms of a 4th qtr closer makes them the very best fit for ben simmons in the league.    the wolves desperately need what simmons does well (defense, rebounding, collapsing defenses in transition and facilitating), and they already have people who excel at what simmons does poorly (4th qtr shooting and scoring).   Simmons-Russell-Beasley-McDaniels-KarlAnthonyTowns"
"I am very positive none of these will happen. I predict a three team trade is likely. Dangelo Russell is not being moved, he is very close friends with KAT and they want KAT to stay. Malik Beasley and picks is the base of what Minnesota will offer. I do think Ben will end up in Minnesota."
"I mean if it’s Malik Beasley and McDaniels were going to ask for every pick and pick swap lol. We have to get fair value, include DLo and you still have Edwards and KAT to build around. It’s their choice, either give up the extra player or give up all the draft capital. Can’t get Ben by giving up 1 average starter and calling it a day"
Rosas isnt an idiot but he traded two lottery picks for DLO and then paid malik beasley $20 mill
"Malik Beasley was a good trade, as was DLo, and edwards was a good and not absolutely unanimous pick, and it appears as though KAT liked him."
"Morey would be a idiot to decline the illustrious offer of Malik beasley, Tauren Prince and Vikings tickets the wolves are offering."
"&gt;Sure ""anybody"" might be able to beat the Wolves offer, but how many are willing.   Multiple teams, including a majority of the ones I named would be willing. I promise you if the best offer Philly gets is that dog shit Minnesota one centered around Beasley and Prince MULTIPLE teams will swoop right in and take Simmons.   &gt;To trade, you need at least two interested and willing partners.    And please explain to me why Philly would want Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince when there are CLEALY better offers out there????  &gt;Right now, it looks like Minnesota and two others and none of the offers out there are better than the Wolves offer.  False. I don’t understand why you Minnesota fans think your offer is so good. You’re setting yourselves up to be inevitably disappointed when Simmons is traded else where after Morey laughs at that offer.   &gt;So sure, sit on Simmons, deflate his value even more   Declining to take a horrible trade package isn’t deflating someone’s value."
"Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, and maybe Josh Okogie and some picks or some shit.   I don't fucking know, just give him to us already. We'll be a dysfunctional mess, but at least we'll be fun to watch."
"You're surprised that they know the name of the GM, the 3 most famous players on the roster, plus Malik Beasley and that they once notoriously overpaid for Wiggins?  I'm about to blow your mind... Josh Okogie"
"Malik Beasley,Jaden McDaniels,Pat Bev and 2-3 1sts."
Malik Beasley and a toothpick
A multipick Malik Beasley package
"The OP to me was blaming Morey for having unrealistic expectations for a trade, and that's why ""no wonder he hasn't been traded"". Because Daryl is expecting a star. When you read into how trade rumors come about, and how Daryl operates as a GM, I really really wouldn't take away too much from what's leaked this summer. He is notorious for offering trades all the time to every team. That's his style, it's not ""being unrealistic"", he asks for a lot and works down from there. It's how all his trades have come about, he's not a moron just ""asking for everything"", those reports are most likely very early half baked calls between two GMs.  I'm not expecting Dame or Beal unless they actively say ""trade me to Philly"", but what I also won't do is make a trade that straight up makes us worse, with no real path forward. For Minnesota for instance, you need to include DLo. You can't expect us to give up a DPOY level guy for Malik Beasley and McDaniels. At this point I'd do CJ, I'd do DLo, Beasley and like 2 firsts? I'd engage with the kings if they gave up Halliburton, Buddy and Bagley for instance is a terrible return no matter Ben's playoff woahs.  I don't think the summer has gone perfectly to plan, but I think we were in a rough spot, and Daryl is maximing the long term outlook of the team."
"&gt; However, those picks can be used for other players.  Sure, in theory, if those other players become available.  Depends on the garbage. Malik Beasley being the best player coming back in a deal means the Sixers aren't anywhere closer to contending than they were last year. Fairly decent step back in fact."
"&gt; Morey is unrealistic with his expectations in a trade.  Look I get that the dude had an awful playoff series but how is it unrealistic to want a good player for a three time all-star and DPOY candidate? Should Morey just accept Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield and call it a day? That would make no sense.  &gt; Dame ain't happening. Neither is Beal.  No team is getting these guys, but there's still plenty of dudes between ""the top guards in the league"" and guys who don't even start. I mean honestly, pull up Ben's resume and say that you shouldn't get an All-Star in return for 4 years of him. Is it really entirely crazy to think that he might be in conversation for a guy like De'Aaron Fox, who has played in exactly 0 meaningful games in his career and has garnered exactly 0 accolades so far?"
Yall boutta get Malik Beasley and a pick swap
"If there is a trade, the package would most likely be something like  Ben Simmons to Timberwolves  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, and either Patrick Beverley or Taurean Prince, and 2-3 first round picks (with some initial protections) to Sixers  Salaries match. No way Sixers do this unless they are desperate. I don’t think Sixers are that desperate. I think they are actually hopeful to give Maxes/Thybulle/Reed some of Simmons playing time to see how they do, even if he sits out."
"It supports the idea that his value is low, it does not support the idea that his value is so low Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield is even a decent return for him. Whatever your thoughts, most GM's are able to take a step back and realize he's still a very good player who is deeply flawed if you're positioned for a deep playoff run. Morey doesn't have unrealistic expectations, he just doesn't want to give him away for nothing when he doesn't absolutely have to."
"Ben for 3 kidneys + Malik Beasley, who says no?"
You think they ain’t been trying to trade him?   Would you trade him for hield and Haliburton?   Or wiggins and a bunch of picks?   Or Malik Beasley and picks  How does that make your team better?  Ben Simmons is a 3 time all star and defensive monster they not gonna trade him for pennies on the dollar
Good idea instead of getting Malik Beasley and 2 first rounder they will get Malik Beasley and 1 second rounder
"I absolutely think Morey is willing to bet on one of Beal, Lillard, or LaVine becoming available before the deadline, and that he thinks the team can stay in the top 6 in the east without Simmons.   At that point if none of those guys was available, he would have to ask himself - is a package built around Derrick White, or Malik Beasley, or Collin Sexton, or another non all-star level guard really worth giving up his best trade chip? I'm not sure any of those players really make it more likely that the Sixers make it past the first round than if they go in with the roster as is."
Yeah because Malik Beasley is the guy who's gonna help us break through and win a title!
They really thought they were getting Dame and are gonna end up getting Malik Beasley and 2 first round picks
What is his value possibly going to depreciate to? The best we can right now is Kevin Love or Malik Beasley lol
Yeah trading Ben Simmons for Trevor Ariza (at best) and Malik Beasley is 100% a fair trade for both sides /s
How unreasonable of them to try to trade him for James Harden and also decline to trade him for Malik Beasley. What scumbags!
Well John Wall and Malik Beasley certainly won’t be what gets us out of the 2nd round so I’m still content with waiting.
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"
"Does Wall, a top ten protected first, Malik Beasley, and Beverley make sense? I feel like they want decent players over picks but neither team wants to give those up"
"Absofuckinglutely....KG, Ant-Man, Beverly and Malik Beasley would be a nice start to a team"
"If the best trade offer on the table is Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels, then yes lol. It's all background noise because there's nothing else happening. Once the season starts, if he's still here and the Sixers start the season fine, it will be pushed to the backburner."
"This is incoherent lol the sixers fucking themselves will not help, other teams will just play the waiting game of “how long are they willing to keep fucking themselves before they trade him for Malik Beasley”. Putting your own team in a position that hurts your team is the opposite of a power move"
"Yeah you're right, better get Malik Beasley ASAP. Championship window reactivated."
"The whole Morey connection has me thinking though. PatBev would make sense for the Sixers. But then if you’re Minnesota why do this whole press conference? If you’re not trading him or KAT/DLo/Ant then how are you getting the salaries to match for Simmons? Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince gets it done in that sense, but then you’d have to include every pick in your arsenal for it to work value-wise. At that point Philly would probably prefer a third team getting involved to take that junk + picks deal and send a star their way, but nobody they want seems to be available. I’m sick of replaying the possibilities in my head lol just gimme a damn Sham slam or Woj bomb already."
lol yeah because I'm sure Embiid would be over the moon if Morey traded Simmons for Malik Beasley and Jaden Mcdaniels.
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
"Honestly, Malik Beasley would be enough if you ask me."
"No stars want to come here anyway, our main path is a trade for a disgruntled star who is upset with having no real shot at a ring and sees Philly as a desirable place to play **with that** top 5 player. Trading Ben is our best path to what you're talking about. But he shot 33% from the FT line against Atlanta, and we've been trying to trade him to a market that doesn't want him.  He's got 4 years left on his contract, what lack of ""professionalism"" are you talking about? We've explored the market, it's not there, so we're asking him to show up to training camp. We're not boggling the trade because we don't want to trade him for Malik Beasley or Colin Sexton. Daryl Morey, the GM who is pretty well regarded around the league, knows the situation and how best to maximize it. We've just been dealt a shitty hand and people are inpatient.  What star wants to come here when it's just Embiid and some ok role players?"
"We have the runner up MVP lol. Every team has championship equity, some have more than others. Objectively, trading Ben for Malik Beasley/Colin Sexton gives us a lower chance at a ring next season. That's how Daryl Morey, and probably most GM's, would think"
Steph better watch out for Malik Beasley
"ITT: Commenters frothing at the mouth that Philly won't make a trade that will destroy their contending chances for a decade. How is no one getting that there is absolutely a middle ground between Dame and Malik Beasley? This ""Simmons has all the leverage"" shit is so detached from the reality of contracts."
"Oh no, by no means I thought the Sixers should accept Malik Beasley. I thought before on how a CJ/Simmons trade would be a win-win if they could work on the peripherals, and I think Simmons is worth a clear cut #2. Hell, if Morey wanted a lanky PF/C hybrid allergic of paint and that thinks he's Giraffe Curry, I would trade KP for him in a heartbeat. Simmons is easily worthy a #2, and would be a low-key #1 trade candidate if not for the situation.   My point is that, at one point, Morey will need to settle, and, although this situation right now points to him faking an injury and ""rehabbing"" until he gets traded, this could degenerate into full Dwightmare, specially if Simmons decides to go public and complain about his price tag. Teams are low-balling Philly, but it takes both to go to the middle ground."
"I mean so far we've got no indication there's an available player who could walk into our starting lineup, most of the options would be rotation at best. Swapping Ben Simmons for Malik Beasley would make the team worse, I know he sucked against Atlanta but you're talking about a DPOY guy. The PG that ran our offense last year. We're a worse team for sure if we make any of the moves suggested in the press.  I guess I shared your sentiment earlier in the summer but Embiid just signed on through 2026. Like, 20-40 games this season isn't ""wasting"" Embiid's prime. We need to maxamize our championship odds, and part of that involves holding onto Ben for as long as we can."
"&gt; Simmons won't play again for the Sixers;  This is not a fact. Threatening to not show up to training camp and actively sitting out while getting fined are two very different things with a lot of steps in the middle. Most players show up to camp, and just play poorly until traded very rarely do they actually not play.  &gt;The longer he stays in his holdout thing, the more distractions the locker room will have and it will be less likely to see good results.  The drama in Philly will be there regardless. If we trade him for Malik Beasley and we're the 7th seed after 20 games that'll cause drama and questions too. I hear the issues with the locker room but players talk, they know the situation already I don't think we're walking into an unknown. Ben just isn't the type to have a Jimmy Butler in Minn type of outburst, he'd fake an injury before doing that IMO.  To address the rest of the comment, I have a hard time seeing how the average fan is better at predicting this stuff than a GM of 15+ years. His job is to help the sixers win a championship, and when you step back from the cliff of all these what ifs, you've got a player you need to trade right after a terrible series. He's going to ask for a lot when the guy could win DPOY next season, but this is Daryl Morey. He asks for crazy trades all the time, it's literally his negotiating tactic and it's worked many times in the past. I don't think we'll even get a CJ level player, but there's a chance with more waiting that we might. Right now everyone is saying to bite the bullet on deals that actively make us worse where we can't even get a starter level player in return for someone who is hugely important to the team like it or not.  This is not worse than the Dwightmare, this isn't worse than the Harden/Vince Carter situation. Ben has no leverage. Nobody wants him, and we've been trying for months to trade him. He's got 4 years left on his deal and I understand the risk we're walking into but nobody seems to realize how bad it would be to take these bad deals now, when in all likelihood Malik Beasley is available for Ben Simmons at the deadline."
"Trading him sooner for what? Everyone says this like there are deals we just missed on. I'm sure Embiid won't be happy if Morey trades Ben for Malik Beasley and suddenly we're a worse defensive team with less championship equity. Morey has been a GM for like 15+ years, we were in a bad spot trying to trade a player off a bad playoff series. He's doing a fine job IMO, and if the Wolves are only gonna give us that idk why we wouldn't take the chance that the season changes something. The deals for the Timberwolves will probably be there at the deadline."
"Would you do Derrick White, Thad Young for Malik Beasley '23 wolves frp? Young 24yo shooter, roll with DJ, Beas, Keldon, Doug, Jakob?"
Think before you type.You think trading for malik Beasley or fucking buddy hield makes the team contenders? That’s how you’d really get embiid to request one
"You are gonna be insanely dissapointed when the trade is Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and 2 firsts"
"Last year was probably as unlucky as we possibly could have been. KAT missed 22 games and was noticeably slower for a while after coming back from Covid, DLo missed 30 games, Malik Beasley missed 35 games, Ant was one of the worst players in the league for the first half of the season, and we had Ryan Saunders as our head coach for half the year.   While I think Beverly is a better fit on our team than Rubio, I think our real improvement comes from better coaching, health, and hopefully another step from our young guys (Ant, McDaniels, Vanderbilt). Plus we were 13-11 with DLo &amp; KAT both healthy last year, which is like a 44 win pace, so I don’t think us being around a .500 team is that crazy barring another year of shit luck."
"Yea so the general consensus I get is that both teams should not do the trade. This is actually interesting in itself. It means the trade isn’t lopsided, but it also means both fan bases don’t seem to think it improves their team.   Also to answer your other question, yes in order to get Ben Simmons, they pretty much have to trade it unprotected. I assume Sixers would never trade Simmons away otherwise.   Also I agree CJ &gt; Ben, but does CJ help the Sixers beat the Nets/Bucks is my question. That’s why I was thinking in my scenario, Sixers can almost punt this season in a way. I don’t think Malik Beasley is necessarily better than John Wall though."
"Market value in this instance being anything over Malik Beasley and two second round picks, which is a legitimate offer I'm seeing floated around here that any GM should and would be fired on the spot for taking"
Malik Beasley.
“Could” being the key word there.   I’d rather have Malik Beasley and DFS every time.
"Derrick Coleman makes Malik Beasley look like Tim Duncan.   There were several _seasons_ where he played liked he did not give a shit about basketball. He turn it on like once or twice a year, just to remind everyone he was simply picking up paychecks the rest of the time."
"Bro, seriously? You got fans of teams offering Malik Beasley and Goran Dragic and you're telling me you wouldn't even want to entertain a discussion for Jamal Murray or Chris Paul?"
"Seriously. They didn’t get 60+ games in any of the last 3 seasons from Malik Beasley, D’Angelo Russell, Robert Covington, or even Teague… they’ve had significant missed time from the guys that would get them in the playoffs"
"Trading him for Malik Beasley isn't making a contender either, so might as well tank."
"It's pretty simple. Ben's value is so low, him holding out makes little difference to them.  Trading him for Malik Beasley wouldn't lead to wins, why not just hold him a couple of years while not paying him and see where that leads to? Hopefully his contract does not advance if he sits out."
"Lmao what? I agree Morey has to swallow his pride and accept less than what he wants, but as long as he does that, he’ll still get traded for better value than Wall + EG. whether that’s  picks, Malik Beasley and Jalen mcdaniels from Minnesota, or CJ straight up from Portland"
"As opposed to what? Trade him for Kevin Love?  What are we talking about here?  Like seriously what is this trade offer the sixers are supposed to be so excited to take in order to improve the team?  Malik Beasley? Bagley +Hield?  The thing to remember is that all of you are fans of OTHER teams. You dont give a shit about the sixers success, so your assurances that you know the exact thing to do are meaningless."
That was a trade for another star and there's no Westbrook level player coming back for Simmons (no one in Philadelphia is clamouring for Malik Beasley).
"Joel just signed a 5 year max. He's knows he's not wining a title with the bag of shit offers we're getting for Ben too.  Will Malik Beasley will be the 2nd best player on a title team?... If not then don't bother making the deal.  Why trade him for a player that won't help us win the title.... What's Ben gonna do next year anyway, he's signed, unlike the rest of the all stars traded, he can't just walk in FA."
Malik Beasley ain't a centerpiece of that. He might as well be in jail the next time a big star requests a trade.
wolves offer might be better with malik beasley in it
&gt;You do know the sixers dont have to trade him. They’re not going to give up an all star for malik beasley just because the timberwolves ask lol.   Okay then start the season with an unhappy player and see how it goes.  Ask /r/timberwolves and /r/rockets
You do know the sixers dont *have* to trade him. They’re not going to give up an all star for malik beasley just because the timberwolves ask lol.
Minnesota said theyre open to trading DLo for Ben..  I dont see why MIN thinks Malik Beasley and a couple bums and late rd picks are good enough.. Philly gonna demand DLo atleast
"&gt;The main packages that exist are a D'lo package that the 76ers are lukewarm on or a Jaden McDaniels,Malik Beasley + filler + picks although Gersson Rosas is reluctant to move D'lo. He believes the 2nd offer is a lot more enticing because those picks could be used later down the line to trade for Dame or Beal, since GM's saw this year how valuable unprotected Minnesota picks are.  If the Wolves get Simmons without giving up any of their best players those picks won't be nearly as valuable."
"“Report: 76ers have traded Ben Simmons for Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, and 2025 2nd round pick”  Yeah I’m calling bullshit on that one.  *wins 2021 Championship*  Ehh, idk, highly debatable"
"&gt;Not sure why you keep bringing up seth curry. We traded a player who has actual nba level skills for him. (Hence why he just got another contract) You guys traded a bust prospect who will be out of the league when his contract ends.  I'm bringing it up because no trades are equal and I'm trying to show you that but you are too arrogant to admit it.   &gt;You can paint ben as whatever you like, we both know hes 10x the player malik fukn beasley is lmao.  Malik Beasley can shoot the basketball so you know."

"Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and Jaden McDaniels are worthless?   Okay chief ✌"
So...you want Ben Simmons for Malik Beasley and Patrick Beverly?
&gt;They are peak delusion right now. They've won 42 games the last 2 seasons combined but apparently half their roster is untouchable.   Delusion? I just said that its harder to get Jaden McDaniels from us than Malik Beasley and if you have a problem with that send an email to the Minnesota Timberwolves and not argue with me since they are the ones who decided that not me.
"Eh, what is Morey supposed to do trade him for scraps? A subpar deal that makes them worse is what would make Morey a clown.  Trading Simmons for Malik Beasley and hoping for the best is a great way to waste Embiid’s prime. Maybe he’s ruined the market now and might have to settle, but idk. It’s a tough situation from the front office standpoint."
"Malik Beasley tries his ass off and is average at best  hilariously, he said his pre-season goal last season was to be in the DPOY conversation"
“You’ll get one Malik Beasley and you will LIKE it”
"Trying to think, is that better than Pat Bev, Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince and 3 1sts?"
"Oh yeah of course, when teams are offering players like Buddy Hield and Malik Beasley, it'd be a fucking steal when you come in with the clear best player the Sixers could get + a huge expiring contract who would be a decent 6th man. Y'all need to actually see what his value is around the league with his lack of development + lack of want to get better, that god awful contract and now him actively saying he wants out and won't report."
"What is the wolves offer? A package around Malik Beasley? D’Lo, KAT, Edwards aren’t in any deal as of yet."
Malik Beasley  Taurean Prince  Naz Reid  2022 2nd round pick (via Washington)   Unprotected 2023 FRP  2024 1st round pick swap  Top 5 protected 2025 FRP  Top 5 protected 2027 FRP
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
"Malik Beasley,Pat Bev,Jaden McDaniels and 2 lightly protected 1sts."
"&gt;This is all emotion and a great way to tank the franchise. You people want him dealt for Malik Beasley or D’Lo then will say Embiid is justified for demanding a trade in two years.  Bro, what they trade him for has no bearing on what I said. He could stay home all season and they could wait until they find the right offer for all I care.   It's pretty funny that you say ""this is all emotion"" when what you just said was a knee jerk emotional reaction.   Sure, go ahead, let Simmons play in front a of a ruthless philly crowd booing him every home game. You do that shit and he will definitely get traded for Malik Beasley lmao"
This is all emotion and a great way to tank the franchise. You people want him dealt for Malik Beasley or D’Lo then will say Embiid is justified for demanding a trade in two years.
"calling me a clown.. look, like i said before, that trade wouldn't make sense for the sixers. we already have a malik beasley in seth curry, so he becomes redundant. and pat bev for ben simmons is not equal value. three point shooting is important, but without simmons, who is creating those three point shots? there is no way sixers make that trade"
pat bev is washed. he has been cut and traded how many times this offseason? and we already have a malik beasley type player in seth curry. no need for malik's below average d. thanks!
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
"No, they wouldn’t. The rumors are that the Timberwolves are offering draft picks, Malik Beasley ($14 M), Jaden McDaniels ($2 M), Naz Reid ($1.7 M), and one of Patrick Beverley ($14.3 M) or Taureen Prince ($13 M). Those contracts combined match Simmons’s contract of $33 M.   Neither of those trades can be completed today though, so we don’t know if the 76ers would accept that offer. Taureen Prince can’t be traded till September 27th and Patrick Beverly can’t be traded till October. As a result, we won’t see any deal accepted until then at the earliest."
"I don’t know why everyone is acting like Sixers fans think they could get Lillard or any other disgruntled star in the future for Simmons straight up.  It’s understood that they would throw in multiple picks and all their young players.  If Simmons is traded for Malik Beasley, the Sixers lose their ability to put a package like that together in the future"
"There's a wide gap between having no leverage, and trading Ben for Malik Beasley and scraps."
"This is actually a really good take. Ben is under contract for the next 4 years and if he doesn’t show up he’s not gonna get paid,simple. Don’t take Malik Beasley+ throw ins. Wait for dame or just like another good player to become available it’s not like you owe Ben the curtesy or anything dude asked to be traded weeks before training camp"
"Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and it's a done deal. No additional picks.  Big 3 of KAT, DLo and Ben looks $p00ky"
"Isn't Malik Beasley pretty dope tho? Admittedly I didn't catch too many Wolves games this last year, but I thought I remember hearing he had some potential to be a pretty good player."
"Damn sixers about to end up with Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Jaden McDaniels and like 3 firsts"
He’s worse at 3&amp;D than players like Mikal Bridges and Malik Beasley though
"Timberwolves traded Ray Allen for Marbury  Traded Brandon Roy for Foye  Traded KG for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, and Telfair  Traded prime Kevin Love (26-13 averages) for Wiggins and Bennett. (Yes at the time this one was kinda fair because of Wiggins hype, but in retrospect it ain’t good).  Traded Michael Beasley coming off his two best seasons for cash  Traded prime Jimmy butler for what eventually turned into Malik Beasley and Beverley"
"Not the absolute worst, but the start of a long line of really poor trades and signings. The last time the Blazers had a bunch of young talent they…  Blazers traded:  - Will Barton and a first round pick that became Malik Beasley (&amp; Thomas Robinson, victor claver)  To Denver for: -Arron Afflalo (&amp; Alonzo gee), to replace injured Wesley Mathews.   Afflalo goes from shooting 50% mid range to 39% and injures his shoulder in 2 months. Leaves blazers a few months later in free agency to the knicks. Out of the league 3 years later.   Matthews after tearing his Achilles leaves blazers in free agency for dallas. Comes back from injury, goes on to be a 3 and D journeyman.   Comparable first round picks (#19 and lower) in 2016 included: - Malik Beasley (Por first round pick to Den) - Caris levert - pascal siakam - dejounte Murray - Malcolm brogdon  Will Barton (who was close with Damian Lillard) while suffering from off and on injuries, has gone on to sign multiple contracts with Denver, whether he has been in the starting lineup or coming off the bench he has averaged approx. 14/3/5 (fg 43%/3fg 36%) with just under a steal a game in his 8 seasons with Denver. While portland has struggled to find a consistent figure to lead a bench unit or fill the sf position."
"You guys have done stupidly well with lower draft picks, so I'm inclined to agree that it's on Bol Bol.  **2018:** Michael Porter Jr at 14.  **2017:** Monte Morris at 51.  **2016:** Malik Beasley at 19.  **2014:** Nikola Jokic at 41."
"&gt; Malik Beasley was out of their rotation than then average 20 as soon as he was traded. Jerami Grant also was obviously much better than they thought he was.  Both of those guys are basically the same guy they were on the Nuggets but getting more shots? And really only Beasley kept similar efficiency. Grant basically just got to be a first option and chuck (not that he was bad, just that him as a 3rd/4th option was probably actually a better role for a team)."
"I just don't agree. And I've watched him a ton.   I don't see how he's any worse than guys like Boban or Kanter who are basically 1 dimensional players. Even Okafor played last year. Hell, Marcus Morris is playing Center on a contender.   I dont see how Bol is any more unplayable than these guys. Maybe he isn't locking down the paint ir whatever but his floor spacing and size are both valuable. I think he can get minutes.   Also, I disagree with your comments about the Nuggets. They are a good team but that doesn't mean they get the best out of all of their players. Malik Beasley was out of their rotation than then average 20 as soon as he was traded. Jerami Grant also was obviously much better than they thought he was."
"We’re the same team that developed Jokic from a later pick than Bol, same with Malik Beasley, and got low rotation players like Will Barton to play starter caliber basketball. We give players chances to prove themselves if they actually show it, whether that’s in practice, summer league, 5 minutes of play, etc. When Bol plays there’s nothing to indicate he’s improving or that he’s changed the habits that are preventing him from playing which is why we don’t give him more opportunities.  Dude had an alright summer league from a scoring perspective but was bottom of the team in +\- and was mediocre on defense the whole time."
Ben beat you Daryl. You’ll get Malik Beasley and picks or you get nothing.
Getting Malik Beasley and PatBev is not gonna help much
Haven't watched any Minnesota yet so I don't know shit but I do wonder why they haven't gotten Malik Beasley involved? After averaging 20 last season I was thinking he'd be a pretty legit scorer in a Jordan Clarkson style 6 man role. But he's only taking 7 shots a game so far.
thank god for malik beasley. need him and ant to step up tonight
"I don’t think Dlo is on the table.   My guess is the offer would be: Malik Beasley, Bev, and this years first round pick."
"You have the incorrect understanding that front offices change their evaluations on players from a game to game basis.  McDaniels certainly didn’t play himself into untouchable territory after 2 games where he averaged 4 points.  And using that logic, Malik Beasley has completely lost his value after looking out of shape and bricking shots so far this season.  In reality, GMs have their mind made up about these players, and it would need to take a great leap in development for them to change whatever projections they have for them"
"Im glad this sub isnt an nba gm, they woulda traded Simmons for Beverly and Malik Beasley months ago."
We currently can’t get anything for him lol. So there is really no rush to trade him. If he wants a trade he needs to show up and rehab his value.  We really aren’t a true contender anyway.  No one can look at this sixers team and honestly tell me we are a Malik Beasley away from a championship.
"Embiid at the 5, CP3 at the 1.  2-4 is hard in the modern NBA.   2 maybe Malik Beasley? Too small to guard many wings, no ball handling or playmaking skills.   3 maybe Wiggins? Ideal size for a wing, too poor of a rebounder to play up as a 4.   4 is tough because any decently sized 4 becomes a small ball 5 now. Need someone that can't protect the rim effectively, nor switch out on quicker guys. Maybe Thad Young?"
I’m sure Embiid stays up at night praying for Malik Beasley to join the squad
"Embiid missed the second game of last year too.  Save me the concern trolling.  People acting like they need to sell Simmons now at any cost have no understanding of this situation.  If Embiid gets hurt, what exactly are guys like Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield going to do?"
"If Embiid gets hurt, the Sixers just tank.  It literally removes the pressure from the season.  It’s not like trading for Malik Beasley or even McCollum will get this team anywhere with a hurt Embiid"
"Where did this narrative come from. Apparently cuz we don’t want Marvin Bagley and buddy hield or Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels, that we will only settle for dame and beal. You know there is a massive number of players between those players skill levels. Players like Colin sexton for example"
Thank you for being logical and not just looking at it from the “we hate Philly lense” that everyone in this subreddit loves using. They think we should trade Ben Simmons for Malik Beasley and Jaden Mcdaniels or Marvin Bagley and buddy Hield. Both trades which add almost nothing to our team. Curry is basically a cheaper hield and they probably can’t co exist. We don’t need role players. We have a good bench filled with good role players and good role players surrounding Embiid and Harris. All we are doing in those trades is very slightly upgrading those young role players and pushing them out. People think we would be better off trading him for peanuts than keeping him
"Sorry that the Sixers don’t want your scraps for an all star dpoy candidate. Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and a couple crappy late picks. Wow yeah! That’s definitely not wasting Embiids prime. Those two players literally add nothing to our team. We have Maxey, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz and Seth Curry who all play a similar shooting guard role to beasley. So if we trade for him it literally just pushes one of our good young role players who are in need of development out of the roster for a player who is not that much better. Yes beasley averaged 19 last year but he adds nothing new to our team that we need and he only averaged that much cuz kat and dlo were out for most of the season. He isn’t taking 16 shots a night at the Sixers. Jaden McDaniels, sure he’s an good young prospect but his ceiling isn’t that high and we have Tobias Harris and George’s Niang who are both better than him. Niang shoots 40% + from 3. So McDaniels would be lucky to even be in the bench rotation. In conclusion, we get nothing"
Incoming wolves 2nd and Malik Beasley for Simmons
Malik Beasley would be a lot more beneficial to the sixers than having a max contract on the bench for 4 years
Team of Current Players:  D'Angelo Russell  Collin Sexton  Malik Beasley  Jaren Jackson Jr.   Montrezl Harrell
You'll take Malik Beasley and some picks and you'll be good with it
Oh yeah what will the sixers do without Jaden Mcdaniel and Malik Beasley when they face the bucks and nets.
Top 5 seed in the East means nothing. It's still a wasted year of Embiid's career when even a bad return like Malik Beasley would make them a top 2-3 team
"No but you see, the only way for the Sixers to win a championship and not waste Embiid’s prime is to trade Simmons for Malik Beasley"
"If we trade him for Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield… that also wastes his prime. What’s so hard to understand here? There are two paths to the Sixers winning a championship: have Simmons play at 100%, or trade him for an All-Star. So that’s what the team is pursuing."
"He is absolutely serious. Morey has said many times before that all that matters is star power, and his strategy is always to hold out until you get a guy that can win you a championship (like Harden, who didn’t win but was a top 5 player).  He’d rather let Simmons sit than take back pennies and depth, and I don’t blame him. Sixers hold the ultimate leverage with 4 years on his deal, and are betting on him breaking before then. Morey was right to not just trade him for Malik Beasley because the media felt a deal needed to happen immediately."
"Joel in 2 years: ""The Sixers got me Malik Beasley. I'm not leaving now. 👍"""
Does that make Malik Beasley his new dad?
"u/EuroStep0 wasn’t very polite, but his honestly sentiment is somewhat understandable. Especially since 76ers fans have been shit on all off-season. However, if you honestly just wanted some outside opinions about a Westbrook for Simmons trade idea, then I’m willing to expand on EuroStep’s response a bit:   The biggest issue with the trade proposal is that the 76ers would never accept Westbrook for Simmons. Morey is being a bit delusional with his trade offers, but not to the degree that he should be willing to take a bad contract back for him. The proposed Minnesota deal of Malik Beasley (good, cheap shooter), Jaden McDaniels (young player with a lot of potential), Patrick Beverly (vet with tons of playoff experience), and picks (Timberwolves draft picks are more valuable than Lakers picks) for Simmons is honestly much better for the 6ers. Westbrook may be a bigger name than any of those guys, but that deal would give the 6ers assets to target a true star later. Plus, the Lakers can’t even add a ton of picks to the deal, cause they dealt them all away for Davis.   Even disregarding the huge loss by the Sixers, how would this even help the Lakers that much? They’d obviously be better since Simmons is much better than Westbrook, but the fit is still terrible. Simmons is arguably the only PG in the league who’s a worse shooter than Westbrook. Seeing as shooting is the Lakers biggest issue, adding Simmons isn’t gonna move the needle too much. If you want to imagine impossible trades, why not imagine ones involving players that fix the Lakers issues, like Kyrie for Westbrook?"
"For sure.  I'm not arguing that they're in a good spot.  It's horrible.  One playoff series took them from ""legitimate contender"" to ""laughing stock of the league.""  I'm only arguing that they have no choice but to hold on and hope.  Nothing floated so far (Hield/Bagley, D'lo/picks, Wall/picks..ect) get them any closer to ""contender"" than they are right now.  The best offer swirling around has been Brogdon/Levert, and neither of those guys will be healthy for the opener.    So what choice do they have?  People keep talking about ""wasting a year of Joel's prime,"" but making a trade for scraps just to get this story out of the headlines is wasting the entirety of Joel's prime.  So what can Morey do except sit tight, hope to win enough games to stay in the playoff picture, pray that something materializing, then go all out if it does.  Morey obvious wants to get rid of Simmons, but I strongly suspect that he is waiting to empty the clip if anyone becomes available.  So best case scenario for the team is Maxey plays great in Simmons absence, Thybulle shoots 37% from 3, the team stays a handful of games over .500, Beal/Dame/Fox/SGA/??? become available, and Morey has by far the best offer out there.  Is that likely?  Hell no.  But it's the only play they have right now.  Worst case scenario is far more likely.  Nothing materializes in the trade market, Simmons continues to make everyone uncomfortable, Maxey plays like a late first round pick, they lose a lot of games, and after the trade deadline, they are stuck with fucking Malik Beasley, Pat Bev, Tobi on an immovable contract, and Joel staring down the barrel of a 6th seed team for the entirety of his prime.   The real question to me is how long can Morey/Joel wait? If I had to bet, I would guess that Morey would have zero issue with letting Ben sit the entire season.  I don't think he would hesitate for a second to drag this into next summer.  So, my guess is that it comes down to Jo.  When does he get pissed off enough to force something to happen?  I think he breaks way before Morey.  Jo's breaking point will determine when this all ends, if a trade doesn't present itself first.   Rant over.  Sorry for the lengthy reply."
I honestly don't know how I mixed em up  but I meant Malik Beasley.
Trading Ben for Malik Beasley and a future first would be just as much of a waste of Joel’s prime as waiting out as long as they can for a semi decent trade offer.
MVP: KAT  DPOY: D'lo  MIP: Anthony Edwards  ROY: Leonardo Bolmaro  6MOY: Malik Beasley  COTY: Chris Finch  Don't @ me.
Swaps that wont convert and role players are not changing the Blazers mind how would you feel if Minnesota offered you Malik Beasley and there young scraps besides edwards? Cause thats how portland feels about this offer
"Because not getting near value for Simmons shuts our window just as hard as fucking about for a few months with him and might get other stars upset. As long as the narrative is ‘Simmons is acting stupid’ he isn’t hurting the Sixers long term. Look at the fucjing offers. Malik Beasley and PatBev + 2 first is the best offer I’ve seen. Simmons is a 3x all star, 2nd DPOY, created most open 3s in the league last year. If you think that makes sense just because Simmons is upset you’re insane."
"I get most people just read headlines and shit, but from the inside it's kind of clear what this FO has been trying to do and people have just missed it. I'm sure other GM's can see the sixers play as well, it's not 4D chess it's just trying to maximize the value of an asset who flamed out again in the playoffs like 3 months ago.  There is a real risk that we can't keep this up and he just has to go, but in terms of leverage he has very little. He's on a 4 year deal, he's not getting paid, and we aren't really looking for trades until the market warms. I think there's a far greater risk tho of just trading him for a good role player and leaving your team in a worse spot. I think even if we lose more games than normal in October/November/December that's not all that important. If Joel goes down injured and we start to slip out of the playoffs then sure, we make a move and bite the bullet. If he keeps being a huge distraction like Jimmy or ownership steps in, we bite the bullet. Everything short of that, is worth the risk IMO and maybe this team without Ben can be good in the east for a few months?  Joel signed an extension this past summer, him and Morey are friends and probably on the same page. I get it's frustrating but taking Malik Beasley + McDaniels now will leave the team much more frustrated down the line than some awkward Ben shit. That's my take at least"
"If we wanted to settle on a deal we could make a deal happen, Buddy Heild and Malik Beasley have been available, but we don't want to trade him lol to maximize our return it's best to have either traded him before the draft, or wait till this season at the deadline.  &gt;Objectively speaking, Morey is asking for too much, and is perpetuating the situation on the team. Go on and on about armchair GMs on r/nba. There's no denying that the rest of the NBA thinks his asking price is stupid.  ""objectively"" no trade discussions have gotten past step 1, we weren't hunting for a deal before training camp or now. This is misunderstanding about how trades are even made, who cares what he asked for if he wanted to make a deal he'll make a deal like Morey has over the course of his career. You blame the leaks of asking price I think it makes much more sense that we haven't been aggressively shopping him since before the draft which was literally weeks after a playoff meltdown...  Regardless the point was about Dame, and you're describing a well liked GM as a moron who has no idea what he's doing. I don't think that's likely, but I'm clearly way off for suggesting that lol"
You're probably gonna end up with Malik Beasley and Pat Bev tho lol
"Morey wants value for what Simmons was last year, an all star, 2nd DPOY, only player who can guard 1-5 and who created the most open 3s in the league. Malik Beasley and PatBev isn’t fair value, and neither is Brogdon."
"Ben should be traded when his value is as high as it can get, that's the basic principle if you're going to trade your 2nd best player no matter his flaws. Anyone paying attention to this knows that was either before the draft this summer, or closer to the deadline this season. In between, it makes little sense to trade him. Teams are excited about their roster now, it's all great heading into the season.  Once he wasn't gone by the draft, he was going to be here for a while barring an injury to Embiid or Ben pulling a real Jimmy Butler where ownership would step in. Our play since then has been to wait through these early months, see which teams are not meeting expectations (like the Timberwolves if they're 8-22 in December) and hope the market warms where other FO's would view Ben as a real piece they need to take a step towards making the playoffs etc.  His value has bottomed out due to the Atlanta series, if we want Buddy Heild and Marvin Bagley that package will always be there IMO. Same with Malik Beasley. Losing games in October/Nov/Dec really doesn't change a lot, we're a tier below the Nets/Bucks anyway so as long as we make the playoffs I see the long term view of trading Ben as most important. That's the thinking I've seen from this FO and honestly with how the situation was this summer, I'm not going to fault our FO for trying to maximize his value whatever that might be. That's the longest view in the room"
yeah morey get it done. Malik beasley and Josh Okogie are waiting.
"We have to because getting Malik Beasley and PatBev does the same for our window as not playing Simmons. If we don’t have to pay him because he acts up, I don’t see this as worse. He doesn’t have the mental fortitude to keep doing this for months."
"The offer is now Malik beasley, his CWP and 3 sweet martha cookie tubs."
"Malik Beasley isn't gonna move the needle for the Sixers to win a ring, Mr. Wolves Beat Writer."
He’s not going the minny for picks and Malik Beasley bro. You’re goofy if you think otherwise. I think the Sixers are far more comfortable waiting this out til December than the r/nba consensus
"Hey if we can get him for Malik Beasley and a first, welcome to Minny Ben"
Malik Beasley+first for Simmons?
Because they can trade those for a superstar when one comes available. Because you know thats what teams are going to be crazing is Malik Beasley and 2 firsts
And how does a Malik Beasley and 2 firsts trade keep the Sixers' window open?
"Man this made me curious as to just how bad this is. My first shot was to go back to 2014.  They picked Jordan Adams 22nd. Rodney Hood and Clint Capela went in the next three picks. Ouch.   In 2015, the Grizzlies selected Jarell Martin 25th. Two picks later Larry Nance Jr. goes. Wow would this have changed history.   2016 is tough, hard to know who they would've taken at the time but Wade Baldwin at 17 surely was not the answer. Two of the next three picks...Malik Beasley and Caris LeVert.   2017 didn't select anybody.  2018 JJJ! A hit! Sure they could have had Trae Young, but I think they are happy with what they have in Ja and JJJ."
"For Rubio, Malik Beasley, pat pev, and a bag of chips 🤣"
"Lavine was a tiny fraction of what he is now in Minnesota. You’re purely speculating that his time there played any role in what he became.  I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt regarding Lavines playmaking but that’s probably the worst aspect of his game outside of his defence so it doesn’t influence how good he is for the most part. His playmaking is also largely just passing out of doubles.  The issue is basically every athletic fringe rotational player is a good defender. Defence is largely based on effort and players who are fighting for minutes will often provide the most effort. What makes defenders stand out is impact and okogie is not an impactful defender. Wings and guards are less impactful as is, so you generally have to be like an all defence guy, or have some offence too.  Fair point with wiggins, I thought I saw him in your list of names.  Your last point however is complete nonsense. For starters i wouldn’t consider him a quality player. I’d consider him a 9th man on most teams. I’d just consider him better than Jabari Parker. Denver traded him along with Malik Beasley, by your logic Malik was nothing resembling a quality player. Minnesota didn’t keep him cause they got Patrick Beverley who is much better and a perfect fit for the team in every way. Memphis traded him cause they have a log jam at his position and got a second or 2 for him. And I have nothing against the Wolves. In fact this year I’m one of the highest on them, and think they have a legit shot at a lower playoff seed. I’ve also been an avid defender of them when people talk about how they should be relocated, or how KAT should demand a trade. It’s just a fact that more often than not their player development is very lacklustre and that a player shouldn’t be completely written off based on how they played in those conditions"
"Kat, Ant, DLo, Malik Beasley,Naz Reid. I'd go Minnesota because of how deep of a team they have."
I’m gonna add Malik Beasley to this. Averaged 20+ last year. Also has really good chemistry with Ant
Not trading for Malik Beasley ain’t destroying the team either
"He’s getting offers for Buddy Heild and Malik Beasley my guy, trading him the summer after the hawks series is as low as his stock will ever go. You still have to match salaries to trade for him anyway, his value will go up for a number of reasons I don’t see how it could ever be lower than trying to trade him weeks after a playoff meltdown"
"* PG: Seth Curry, Jordan Clarkson * SG: Buddy Hield, Terry Rozier * SF: Malik Beasley, Duncan Robinson * PF: Davis Bertans, Joe Harris * C: Karl Anthony-Towns, Kelly Olynyk  77% chance at playoffs (projected record of 47-35), 2% chance at a title"
So…Minnesota’s offer of Malik Beasley and Patrick Beverly is the best offer on the table according to the media.
"He shot 33% from the FT line and had to be subbed out in the 4th Q of every game against the Hawks. That's where his value dropped, not because Doc Rivers didn't know if he was a championship PG or not. If Doc and Embiid say absolutely nothing, GM's would not view this situation any differently, they're smart people who can weigh the pros and cons of a player far better than the average fan.  Our window to trade Ben has always been before the draft when picks are more valuable, or in December/January/February when teams realize they're not as good as they thought they were and more players can be included in a 3 team deal. There's no point in making a trade now when everyone is happy and excited about their roster and if we can wait for the market to warm or another team to become desperate then you do that. There's not much opportunity cost if all we could've gotten for Ben was Buddy Heild or Malik Beasley.  People have been critical of Morey all offseason, and yet now Ben's plan hasn't worked and he's now rather close to rejoining the team. I THINK the GM of 15+ years knows what he's doing just a little"
Malik beasley and picks lol
"Because one of the greatest players in the NBA and a Generational talent shooter, James Harden, was available. Ben should be honored that he was once considered a great package for James Harden. Now Ben is on trade packages for Malik Beasley and Wiggins."
"It’s hard to copy Denver. They’ve been one of the best drafting teams in the league. Getting Jokic in the second round is obvious, but they’ve also hit on a ton of mid to late first round picks.   ### All their first round picks were great in 2016  -	Jamal Murray (#7 Pick) -	Juan Hernangomez (#15) -	Malik Beasley (#19)  ### They got a solid player in 2017, despite not having a first round pick.  -	Monte Morris (#51)  ### Michael Porter Jr was obviously a steal in 2018  -	Michael Porter Jr (#14)  ### No Pick in 2019  ### Both their picks in 2020 seem to have potential   -	Zeke Nnaji (#22) -	RJ Hampton (#24)  ### Bones Hyland has played super well in pre-season  -	Bones Hyland (#26)"
"Herro may not be a rising star, but he has the skills to be a very productive role player. He’s a good three-point shooter and has good off-ball movement. Those are two important traits for complimentary players in today’s league. Kuzma is an ok shooter and a decent defender, but he has moments where he goes completely brain-dead and his movement generally looks very clunky in a “Bambi learning to walk” way. So, is he “Kuzma East” in terms of hype? Sure, but Herro is still a good young player with good potential, even if his ceiling is a Malik Beasley/Terry Rozier type."
I remember seeing people laugh at Dlo + Malik Beasley but in my head that’s a great deal for both teams. A former/potential all star in Russell and a solid starter (at positions you need) for a guy who wants to leave seems like a great trade in my mind.
How would you argue that lol? Our serious offers are Buddy Heild or Malik Beasley at the moment assuming the Pacers won't give up much. His value being low on a max contract does not make it easier to trade him considering you have to match saleries up to a point.
"Minnesota gets the 5 seed and makes it to the 2nd round, after trading a package of Beasley, Beverley, and several picks a month or so into the season for Ben Simmons.  Also Malik Monk wins MIP and signs a 4/80 contract next summer"
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
"Not sure what desmond bane have to do with you declaring a 20 year old big man for sucking. Especially considering how there was no gleague last year so basically no arena for him to actually play and improve his game. Not sure what you expected him to learn since SL  MPJ can stil barely dribble.   and Europeans are wrong just as everyone else. Vlatko was always good, was starting for Slovenia winning eurocup before coming over easily comparable to Nnaji a guy Nuggets fans hadnt heard of until we drafted him.  And the difference between an early 2nd round pick and late first is minimal. Malik Beasley has nothing to do with it. Its not like it's more important to hit on picks aquired from trading a player."

"Let's be real here: ML was on his way out of the league if he never said those comments. If Malik Beasley (who served his time in prison, so I'm not sure what more punishment you want anyhow) was as washed up as ML, his career would probably be over too."
Funny that you can punch your GF in the face (Terrance Davis) or threaten people with an assault rifle (Malik Beasley) and that’s all water under the bridge. But Leonard deserves to have his career ruined.  It’s like Chappelle mentioned in his Standup. DaBaby legit killed someone and nobody cares. Then he said something homophobic and people flip. DaBaby and Leonard were both wrong in what they said. But it’s funny where people draw the line. Violence doesn’t seem to matter in this country.
"He wasn’t going to turn down that kind of money. If 76ers have a down year and Ben isn’t returning or if he got traded for Malik Beasley+ parts, I can see Embiid getting pissed. I mean Dame still has bunch of years left and folks swear he’s gone. He could sign an extension next summer and trade rumors still probably won’t die."
"I'm an FSU alum, and boy did we love Terence Mann. He came in with a class of highly ranked players (Malik Beasley and Dwayne Bacon), and while they left early to go to the NBA, he stayed all 4 years and became a true leader on our team. I remember when he left there were people even suggesting we retire his number."
What I’m hearing is Malik Beasley for Simmons 1:1
"What other colleges can stack up with FSU right now in the NBA? I know there are a few, but for being a football school it’s shocking that FSU has to be in the top-5ish?  PG - Scottie Barnes SG - Malik Beasley SF - Terrence Mann PF - Patrick Williams C - Jonathan Isaac  Devin Vassell off the bench"
Kyrie Irving is gonna join the jail time big 3 with KCP and Malik Beasley
"It’s entirely contingent on injuries. If their main 3 guys stay healthy through the season they’re making the playoffs. They have a budget big 3 plus Malik Beasley - last year was just a shit show for them. Their core never played together, Beasley had to sit out games, and still their biggest problem was coaching lol. Also fuck pat bev.      But getting him for Rubio is an underrated move that suits this roster so well."
"Malik Beasley, so yes"
"It sounds fishy coming from a rival executive but he’s absolutely right. Not only does Ben have 4 years left on his contract, but the sixers never stated that they refused to trade him. I think every fan on earth recognized that if he came back the hope was that Beal would free up before the deadline and they could put a package together but Ben and rich Paul’s solution to wanting to get traded is intentionally tanking his trade value and forfeiting millions, making it harder for him to get traded. The sixers shouldn’t be in any rush to trade Ben if the package isn’t good enough to make them a better team. Everyone’s talking about wasting Joel’s window but what is Malik Beasley and picks gonna really make the team much better than just having Ben ride the bench? They go from a one and done playoff team with Ben on the bench to maybe a second round exit doing any of the trades they have on the table currently, and that’s being very generous."
"We don’t know how the nba is going to look in a couple months. Maybe dame has an off year, maybe he finally wants out after an abysmal start, might as well just wait it out and go big. None of that Malik Beasley. They’re not winning a ring with that shit"
They’re fucked either way might as well go big or go home. None of that second round shit with fucking Malik Beasley.
They would definitely be able to get some pieces that helps them. For example I bet they are getting Malik Beasley in a package from Minny. He is a good shooter so how would that not help them?
"Yeah people on this sub think Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, and 3 protected firsts are enough to make us contenders. The Sixers' goal should be to hope we can float in the 4-6 seed range while Ben sits, and then that some team gets desperate enough to talk. If the goal is to win a ring for Embiid, selling low on our only asset is not gonna help."
"You have leverage over Ben, but not over other teams. Dude is a diva, hasn’t improved since his rookie year, and is making max money. He gets played off the court in the playoffs because he can’t make a free throw.  He has talent don’t get me wrong, but he has major flaws as well. There’s a reason the players being floated in trade offers are Malik Beasley, Buddy Hield/Marvin Bagley, and Caris LeVert. Teams just aren’t going to give up a 85 cents on the dollar offer for Simmons even if he is All NBA. Sixers are more likely looking at a 50-60 cents on the dollar type offer if you want to be realistic"
"Then someone has to make a legit offer instead of Malik Beasley, PatBev and 2 picks."
"&gt; Will Philly forfeit a year of Embiid?  If their best offer is a package spearheaded by Malik Beasley, they already forfeited. Philly is in Championship or Bust now."
"It is, Anthony Dumbvis is a bum, you should trade him for quality role players like Malik Beasley and Jake Layman"
Id make the argument Danny Green wouldnt even start for the Wolves and we suck .  Would you put both Dlo and Malik Beasley on the bench and start Ant and DG? You could... not sure if that would get the best results though.  Or i suppose you could go small but that always seems to bite us
Malik Beasley with better rating than OG Anunoby?
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
Pat Bev/Malik Beasley/FRP?  I don't totally  understand why the Wolves want so many guards? If you're building around DLo KAT and Ant you can probably deal Beasley or Okogie and Pat Bev.  I have no idea if this is enough for the Sixers.
"Yeah I think he's wrong that it would benefit teams in normal circumstances.  I think though that it holds true for Ben in this case, I haven't seen a single hypothetical offer that sways me from 76ers POV. Unlike the Davis/Butler/Harden cases 76ers can't rebuild right now because of Embiid. If the centerpiece is going to be Brogdon or heaven forbid a Malik Beasley type then the 76ers may as well choose death. I'd take the miniscule chance that someone gets desperate in 5 months or Ben changes his mind versus certain death by a current offer."
Embiid after all they get for Simmons is Malik Beasley and Patrick Beverley
"Lol how is this upvoted? When the fuck has Jokic had a garbage team? Two years ago  he had Jerami Grant, MPJ, and Malik Beasley coming off the freaking bench. When they got off the Nuggets they showed they could scored 20+ a night.   I dont mean to discredit Jokic but stop exaggerating. Nuggets have been so good at drafting recently that they've been assuredly deep."
Yeah lets go get Malik Beasley and scraps to save the process
"Yeah lets go get Malik Beasley and some useless firsts, that'll save Joels prime! The moment we take that trade we may as well trade Joel as well because we are done contending"

"No, he's pretty terrible.   It's always been shocking to me because he doesn't lack for effort and he gets in  stance, he's athletic, he doesn't totally zone out off ball, it's a bit baffling. What I've always seen is that he just totally overreacts to even the simplest of moves and ends up moving himself out of the way of the guy he's supposed to be defending. FWIW Malik Beasley has almost the exact same problem."
"we'll give u malik beasley and taurean prince for ben simmons to help kick it off, we'll even throw in a second."
I feel like Malik Beasley is way too athletic to be just doing spot up shooting..does he just have zero handle to do anything off the dribble?
nobody wants malik “one good game in 2021 and a failed drug test away from prison” beasley for literally any price other than like a second rounder
&gt;Sadly Malik Beasley is washed tho  he's been returning to form lately  he spent the off-season in jail so he put on weight and didn't get much time to get in shape and train. He will play himself into shape eventually.
I always believed in this team lol  Sadly Malik Beasley is washed tho
Damn can’t believe you forgot Malik the Beas Knees Beasley
"That's a major undersell. Guys like Luke Kennard, Malik Beasley, Marcus Morris, Bertans, Markkanen, Duncan Robinson, Bojan, Joe Harris, Aaron Gordon are all making 14 mil+. There's no reason Bobby couldn't get that much."
Malik Beasley.... is the truth?
"Ok so let’s just pretend that luka demands a trade after losing in the first round of the playoffs again, since that’s hypothetically the only way the Mavericks would listen to offers. You’d have to look for something like the Harden package but way, way better, because 1) the Harden trade sucked for the rockets and 2) Luka is only 22. So the most competitive offers would probably look like:  Boston offering Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Marcus Smart (maybe? idk how the contracts would work) and all their picks  Pelicans offer Ingram, Alexander-Walker, Herb Jones and picks  Sixers offer Simmons, Maxey, Danny Green, Korkmaz and picks  Timberwolves send a paltry offer of Malik Beasley, D-Lo, McDaniels, Nowell and all their picks  Kings send a slightly less insulting offer of Fox, Bagley, and Davion Mitchell along with all of their picks  Maybe the Pacers get involved with Brogdon and Duarte?  Thunder could be in the mix with their millions of picks, although there’s no way Luka would demand a trade just to get sent to OKC lol.   Off the top of my head those are the only teams that could/would throw together some big trade package if Luka wants out.   Plus, when it comes to picks, you’d be looking at ~8 firsts (4 unprotected firsts, 4 pick swaps)  Obviously none of these trades match his value, but when your star player publicly demands a trade you begin to lose leverage and have to start looking for the best deal available.   Pelicans and Thunder have the best draft assets of the teams listed, Sixers and Celtics have the best talent offered. I’d be most inclined to take the either the Sixers or Pelicans deal, but I’d still try to squeeze every last asset I could get out of them."
Malik Beasley and a second round pick you say? Deal!
"Nah you see, Morey fucked up not taking Malik Beasley the second he was offered"
True. Malik Beasley was the key to capitalizing on Embiid’s prime.  In all seriousness though the deadline hasn’t even passed you moron
"Malik Beasley, going from a solid 20 ppg shooter with 44-47% to this season 10ppg on 33%. Obviously there are some big factors like Ant stepping up along with Dlo being back this season and the addition of Pat bev. The biggest obviously is he was in literal jail this summer, but still a huge dip from being a good trade piece to fighting for minutes. And with a 10 point drop that is as much of if not more then a lot of ppl being mentioned"
is that supposed to be Malik Beasley or Avery Bradley
"Oh man I remember that give vividly. We had just traded like half our roster, and D'Angelo Russell was out that game with an injury. Malik Beasley just kept knocking down threes and DLo was in this weird trenchcoat and beanie and kept saying oh my god. That game even got me to believe in Ryan Saunders for a bit."
"&gt; And no he didn’t immediately after the season there were good trades to be hand. The 6ers didn’t do it.  By the reports we were the first ones to make contact in the offseason and ask him to return to the team, and that's when he said no and asked for a trade. Also what trades are you talking about? The offers over the summer were dogshit packages around Buddy Heild and Malik Beasley lol  Shooting 33% from the FT line in a playoff series is a severe issue, it's either a total mental block or a lack of practice/effort. It's inexcusable for any player, he literally had the worst Ft shooting series from a guard in the history of the NBA playoffs.   He also showed up and reported to the team when we continued fining him per the CBA, only to get kicked out of practice a day later lol come on my guy"
"The homer pick would be Jalen Brunson. The guy has been pretty great in spurts, but being Luka's backup makes it hard to shine consistently.   The non-homer pick: can you imagine Malik Beasley on a roster that isn't overloaded with SGs?"
"If you're gonna hear r/nba, the Sixers would already be fielding Malik Beasley in the starting 5 and Giddey would've won ROY already.   On court, what Morey is saying is that either he effectively rates Simmons miles higher than Cade (which would mean he probably have 15-20 names on his list, and every one is an All-NBA) or he thinks Embiid have glass knees and won't endure another 3 years in the league, because if you insert Cade in this second and run a Cade/Maxey/Thybulle/Tobias/Embiid, you're making an ECF run. Cade is literally what Philly needs plus good shooting.   If Cade isn't enough, we're looking at a portfolio of players that is probably summarized on Dame, Luka, Steph, Trae and Harden, and I can't even say I'm 100% sure Morey wouldn't ask for additional assets if Luka or Trae were offered. Refusing to trade Simmons for bench players is a right call, but thinking you can swap him one-on-one for an All-NBA with a 30%+ AST% straight up isn't trying to force a window open, it's straight being delusional."
"I interpreted this as trade AD for Simmons, and that that would be bad for clutch and I was already getting erect. What about Russ, THT and a pick for Simmons and green btw. Im higher on Russ contributing in the next 2 years than fucking Malik Beasley or other offers, we get another young piece in THT, you get a 3nD and immediately fix your defence."
Malik Beasley and Naz Reid for Myles
"If Maxey was in Ben’s spot last year they might’ve given up 15 more points, or he might’ve dropped 30 and won them the game before that. I love Maxey, but let’s not pretend Ben wasnt really fucking good last regular season.   Maxey flourishing is exactly what gives us/Morey the time to find a trade that makes sense and not take fucking Malik Beasley and PatBev."
"I absolutely disagree. If anything r/NBA still highly overvalues Ben Simmons. Morey explored the Kings as a third team already when they were trying to get Harden. The Kings didn't want to give up Fox for Ben then either. Buddy Hield and Malik Beasley are the 4th best players on their teams. That's where I would put Ben on a ""good"" starting lineup. Even when Ben was the 3rd best player behind two MVP caliber players in Embiid and Butler, the 76ers weren't good enough."
"Ben isn't playing right now, so I'd actually argue that anything is better than nothing. So yes, I do think Malik Beasley or CJ would improve the Sixers chances at competing for a title... because right now they are getting NOTHING from Ben, who is on a max contract and is wasting a roster spot."
Trading him for Malik Beasley or CJ McCollum does not increase their odds to win a title. So they’ll let him stew and keep fining him
"Great point, appreciate the thoughtful response! It would probably help to define what throwing away Joel's prime means. To me it means losing your chance to compete for a title with this roster, which they had to some extent with Ben playing. They lose that by Ben sitting. They also lose that by trading him for Jaden McDaniels and Malik Beasley or the other rumored scraps that have been offered.   The question is: do they have a higher chance of improving the roster to a point where it could compete again by holding out and hoping the offers for Ben improve or trading him for a shit package now and then trying to use those and other assets to try and improve the roster? My money is on the former."
"Still seems much more like the mechanics of any trade rather than his value severely impacting negotiations. Ben is, for all his faults, still a really good player and one of the best defenders in the league. Given it's not contenders that were interested in him, what they were buying him *for* shouldn't really change over time. They want defense, increased playmaking, and a star player who wouldn't otherwise sign with a franchise like them.   The fact that we can still get Buddy Heild or Malik Beasley speaks to that value, and how GM's can weigh everything in front of them. He is a highly impactful player and it's not like either of those teams is uber concerned with playoff performance right now. I don't see much evidence that his value keeps going lower, GM's will weigh his playoff struggles much more than the petty back and forth drama.  They know this is business, they're faaaaar close to Morey's assessment of things than /r/nba. But they also have a position to protect so they'll want a deal that's best for them. But if you still think we can get either of those two players, his value really hasn't dropped much."
Laura is the real villian she was messing with Malik Beasley too
How? Over the summer we were offered Buddy Heild + Marvin Bagley or Malik Beasley + McDaniels...you still have to match 75% of his salary for a trade to even be approved by the league.  You think by the deadline we're far away from being able to acquire Heild or Beasley?
"He didn't play defense at LSU and still went #1 lol. The dude is v good at basketball and one of the best defenders in the league.  Unless you think we're going to attach picks to him, and get a salary dump in return, I dont' see where his value goes lower. You still have to match salaries and we were offered the Buddy Heild + Marvin Bagley package over the summer. We were offered Malik Beasley + McDaniels from Minnesota.  If you believe his value can go lower you're basically saying you think we're not even going to get even a positive asset in return. GM's aren't that swayed by off the court drama. You think if this drags on, and we called every GM in the league our best offer would eventually be John Wall for Simmons + Maxey lol?"
"He does take a ton of 3's but effeciency also has to be talked about relative to the offense, and no one on that Wolves team after KAT is efficient and Edwards is the only one after KAT being respectable among the top scorers. DLo shooting 38% from the field, Malik Beasley shooting 31% from the field and Beasley is a guy who was a near 50/40/x guy in Denver.   That just shows that the offensive system itself is inefficient if known scorers can not even be respectable.   Again, I get Edwards has had bad moments but he is 20 years old, a 2nd year player. He is going to have those games he is developing and finding himself in a offense that is doing him no favors"
"The real cost of the sixers not dealing Ben is not being able to grab a huge free agent in the offseason. They should want to deal Ben before the trade deadline so they can target someone next year, they’re not winning with or without Ben this year. Trading Ben for Malik Beasley isn’t going to move them closer or farther away from winning a chip this year, but holding ben until the offseason will move them farther away."
you're right how will the sixers ever find a package better than malik beasley and jaden mcdaniels oh no they're ruined...
Yeah. I don't know how anyone looks at the current 6ers team and thinks that CJ McCollum or Malik Beasley is going to put them over the top. They kind of have to hold out for more or it's pointless.
"I could see that working the other way and inhibiting a deal.  Players that have been rumored to be offered for Simmons include CJ McCollum, Malik Beasley, Buddy Hield... those guys are good shooters and could help the 6ers in certain ways, but they aren't the type who can take over a game and relieve Embiid's playmaking/facilitating burden. Plus, unlike in previous years the 6ers seem fine with their outside shooting capabilities.  So far, teams don't seem to be interested in giving up true playmakers like Lillard, Fox, Beal, etc. Makes sense, as that's exactly the kind of player you need to pair with Simmons to make him most effective."
"But if the option on the table is Malik Beasley or something then it’s still a waste. If there was a trade on the table that was worth it they woulda taken it by now. But at this point, keeping Simmons as dead cap isn’t much worse than trading him for a player that doesn’t improve the team."
"They could’ve had CJ, brogdon/Turner. Stop this Malik Beasley bullshit."
&gt; You’ve basically conceded another year of at best a second round exit  Yes tell me how Malcolm Brogdon or Malik Beasley gets us out of the second round
Trading Simmons for Malik Beasley is wasting Embiid’s prime for sure though.   The chance of getting a better player or Simmons just coming back definitely outweighs taking scraps because of impatience.
And you know that how? Because he isn’t paying out of his ass for CJ? Because he isn’t taking Malik Beasley + PatBev seriously? Because of some rumours about Brown? You really think Morey wouldn’t pay picks in addition to Simmons for someone like brown? You’re as delusional as you make Morey seem.
Trading Ben for a random Malik Beasley or something you’re sure you won’t win a title with embiid at all. Giving up a year and getting an actual running mate is.
"Malik Beasley, Patrick bev and a first for Ben."
Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels.
"Brogdon + LeVert, which is really just a package for Brogdon given LeVert's injury history, was offered like a week into the offseason. I'm not entirely sure we'll net a better player all around, but it's far from an obvious move to make. I wouldn't jump at the first offer either, no matter who I'm trading. Overall most of the packages were for the Buddy Heild/Malik Beasley types. People keep saying we ""fucked up"" because there was some nice package we just turned down. That's not what happened this summer.  &gt;The 76ers are straight up a better basketball team without Simmons. Adding Brogdon and Levert would have been great additions.  Absolute lies lmao this team is a better offensive fit around Embiid, but we are not a better team. Our defense is below average and a lineup of Maxey/Curry/Brogdon/Tobias/Embiid is not that good in the east anyway.  We could be a better team in October/November/December if we had already traded him for role players, but that doesn't serve our long term goals no matter how you cut it.   &gt;Over the summer Morey was sending clown offers like Simmons for Lillard and Simmons for FVV+4th overall+OG Anunoby.  I think the GM of 15+ years knows what he's doing when he calls other people around the league lol. If you read at all about how trades get made it's rather informal and GM's talk all the time. Daryl, is also known for being the most active GM calling other teams with crazy offers and that hasn't hurt his stock, shunned him from the league, or prevented him from making good deals like he did with Josh Richardson and Al Horford.   There's things to criticize from our side for sure, but I would 100% rather wait for Minnesota to be desperate 30 games into the season than trade Ben literally weeks after he had the worst few games of his career."
"&gt; while lowering Ben’s value   Ben's value bottomed out when he shot 33% from the FT line in the playoffs, it doesn't go lower than public humiliation after a game 7 loss. Kings were trying to offload Marvin Bagley in a Simmons deal over the summer.  Embiid also signed an extention this summer with everything going on. If we traded Ben for Buddy Heild or Malik Beasley our prime with Embiid is 1000% over."
"But there are no fair trades lol. Malik Beasley and Pat Bev for Ben fucking simmons is insanity. You blow up Embiid’s window more if you take that trade than if you play down Ben Simmons for a season.   The moment a fair offer presents itself Morey will take it, but for some reason everyone here has convinced themselves that Ben Simmons is actually a bad player. He has clear issues, but he’s still a 24 year old 3x all star, 2nd in DPOY, who creates an insane amount of 3s. You don’t trade him for scraps, hell it wouldn’t surprise me if the owners/NBA massively support Morey behind the scenes because if this becomes the norm it fucks all of them if Ben succeeds."
"It happens within the fans too. Totally understandable to shit on Karl Malone as a person, but many can\`t get past that and can't recognize what a great player he was. I've seen in on this sub constantly with players like Derrick Rose, Terrance Davis, Malik Beasley and more recently Enes Kanter."
"I think Middleton already proved himself lmao  You're probably looking for Malik Beasley, Bagley or Dillon Brooks type of player who wants to prove something"
&gt;0.5		Malik Beasley misses 74-foot three point jumper  lol
Lmao Malik Beasley tried his best
"Yeah idk where this idea that Jokic has been playing with scrubs comes from. Multiple players the Nuggets had coming off the bench (Jerami Grant, Malik Beasley, MPJ, Plumlee) are now starters. .  Jokic has always had a really good supporting cast"
Throw malik Beasley in the mix too. Scottie can’t catch a break
"DLo has been fine. He's just the only player on the team that can pass. Edwards just doesn't have the ability to make other players better yet. KAT is slow reading double teams. Malik Beasley isn't out there to pass.  If 3/4 of your offensively slanted players can't pass, you're in for an inconsistent season.."
Yeah like Buddy Heild or Malik Beasley. He’s such a moron for not jumping on that!
Looking back on this is hilarious. Jaden McDaniels and Malik Beasley.
Malik Beasley did this.
"He's far from an albatross of a contract, he's literally a DPOY finalist. I know where his value is, and most GM's do as well but selling low just so we can have guys contribute in October and November is and will always remain dumb. Our team is also doing pretty well without him so...  If you trade him for Malik Beasley our window is shut and we're miles off Milwaukee and Brooklyn anyway. The opportunity cost is not high for us, we can punt time if it means a better return down the road. Our bet has always been circumstances changing for others rather than Ben's value increasing. His stock bottomed out when he shot 33% from the FT line against Atlanta, it's not going lower and we don't NEED contributors today. We need a long term plan, and this strategy fits that MO"
"Agreed, the Sixers have made it clear they would want a piece to keep them a contender for Ben, DLO doesn't make sense for Philly to trade for, Malik Beasley maybe but it seems a little weird. Not sure how they'd make it happen"
Disgusting behavior. Myles Turner should be traded to the Timberwolves for Malik Beasley Naz Reid and a 2nd round pick immediately as a punishment for this egregious act.
trading ben for some mediocre players like Malik beasley or whoever does 0 for this team. it makes much more sense to hold onto simmons for now. he's not going to waste 4 years of his prime
"Genuinely can't believe people still think his stock didn't bottom out after he collapsed again in the playoffs lol he shot 33% from the FT line for a whole series. We got offered Buddy Heild and Marvin Bagley this summer lol. You do know you have to match salaries in a trade anyway, we will get players in return for him and whatever you think coaches in the league think he's the best defender in the whole damn league, he has value.  What do you think will happen? We have to start attaching picks to Ben and trading him + Maxey for an expiring John Wall lol? He's not THAT bad. Everyone said this over the summer and we're still in the same place. You think the kings are no longer offering us Buddy Heild or the Timberwovles have made Malik Beasley untouchable?"
"Last year we had horrible injury luck. This year was going to be the “make or break” year. If there’s no progress, then we think about rebuilding around Ant. But it never made sense to rebuild last year or before this season was done, you’d have to really know nothing about the wolves to think that.  I still think this team potentially has good basketball ahead of them this season. Almost every game they’ve lost has been very winnable, and they’ve blown many large leads.   And obviously KAT is going to get dragged right now, but most nights he has not been the problem at all. Ant and Dlo have been much worse. Literally all of our players are shooting below their career averages. If Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince were shooting anywhere near their career averages on 3s, we would be okay.   KAT is getting traditionally good shooters pretty good shots, which they have been absolutely bricking."
"a strong, athletic 7-footer that shoots 40% from 3 year after year on high volume could be the best player in the NBA since he would in theory:     \- get a quality shot whenever he wants   \- pull the opposing center out to the 3 point line, making it easy for teammates to score   \- protect the rim on defense     KAT's usage rate is FAR too low, though.  he's maybe the most offensively skilled center ever but he's 39th in usage rate currently. Last year he was 24th is usage rate and the year before he was 21st in usage.  In fact, he has NEVER been in the top 20 for usage rate.  KAT should be average &gt;30 PPG and &gt;5 APG year after year and should be shooting at least as often as KP on the 2018 Knicks or KD on the Thunder.  Instead KAT doesn't hunt for his shot aggressively enough and defers to Malik Beasley and Dlo far too often (or Wiggins when he was on the team). So, he doesn't do those first 2 points as effectively as he could(i.e. his skill is ineffective because he's not aggressive)     Defensively, KAT doesn't protect the rim and also isn't good at switching/hedging/making rotations.  He just doesn't understand how to play defense so there's no way to hide him. Minnesota's D-rating is worse when he's on the floor each of the last 3 years.     With the exception of the 2016 Cavs that had the arguable GOAT(LeBron) at his absolute peak, you \*need\* a good defensive center to win the NBA championship:     2021 Bucks - Lopez   2020 Laker - AD   2019 Raptors - Gasol   2018 Warriors - Zaza/Draymond   2017 Warriors - Zaza/Draymond   2016 Cavs - Love(lol)   2015 Warriors - Bogut/Draymond   2014 Spurs - Duncan   2013 Heat - Bosh   2012 Heat - Bosh     To recap, KAT in theory could be the best player in the world but in reality he doesn't play anywhere near that level on offense because he's too passive and his poor defense makes it such that it doesn't make sense for the Wolves to build around him."
DLo Malik Beasley and filler for Ben Simmons is …? I’m not sure which team is offended by this offer tbh
Malik Beasley fighting KAT for the rebound…not a fan of that for the team chemistry or culture
Will Malik Beasley ever hit a shot again?
the player in question? Malik Beasley
"Yeah, in theory, a core of DLo-Ant-KAT should be solid enough if the rest of the roster were decent.   PatBev and Malik Beasley are solid enough in that regard.    But even still, I'd argue the Timberwolves' 4th-15th guys are the worst in the league."
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"
"&gt;  jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick.  IQ was picked 3 picks before him and hes been better  desmond bane was picked 2 picks after him and outplayed him last night   &gt;naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too.  actually agree with all of this will always endorse naz reid would love to have him on the hornets  &gt;okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win.   he's not a rotation player? more of a sporadic player, on one of the worst teams in the league. not to mention offensively non existent?  &gt;he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick.   roco is the best piece in this trade if the goal is to win basketball games  &gt;youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no.  you act as if all gm situation are created equal and all of those guys traded away a first round pick the next year basically saying ""we are competing"" then won 23 games, thats remarkable incompetence  and his encore roster looks like it might win 20-25 again  and last i checked the objective was to win games and his tenure not only put the wolves nowhere near doing that, it put them farther away   that is why it is fair to judge him on win percentage when not only did he sabotage their future he managed to sabotage their present as well"
"&gt; D'Angelo Russell, Kat, and Malik Beasley   These 3 guys are the furthest thing from the problem with the roster, but yeah, the roster sucks.   We're giving like 80 minutes a game to guys who have no business being on an NBA court."
"Wolves fans can't accept it's a roster issue.  It'd actually take great effort to put together a more one dimensional roster.  ""All they do is shoot threes!"" As if having D'Angelo Russell, Kat, and Malik Beasley slashing majestically to the rim was an option and only hasn't occurred yet due to a lack of coaching foresight by Chris Finch."
"yes youre missing everything good he did lmfao. jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick. naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too. okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win. he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick. he overpaid juancho a little bit (but $7 mil a year is certainly not horrible), but then flipped him and culver for beverly, which significantly improves guard depth, experience, and defence to replace rubio while giving up two players who barely belong in the league and no picks.   rubio trade was bad, yes. dlo in minnesota is significantly better than wiggins was in minnesota, and theres a very good chance kat wouldve already demanded a trade if dlo wasnt there. it was worth it just for keeping kat happy if nothing else.   youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no. the wolves just have had horrible injury luck the last two years, that’s no fault of the GMs and its really stupid to judge him on that."
"horrible take lmfao he was the best wolves gm in years. wasn’t incredible but he consistently made solid moves, the rubio trade and culver pick were really the only questionable ones, and he only took culver bc he expected the cavs to take culver, not garland. ill die on the hill of the dlo trade being not a bad trade even if it wasnt great, and pickups like naz reid, malik beasley, jaden mcdaniels, and others show he has a great eye for talent"
"Man, this thread is just proof that people overreact like crazy to runs of less than 10 games. Jordan Poole right now is basically a homeless man's Malik Beasley and people are overreacting because he's on the Warriors. Vice versa with Fox's bad run of form."
"I agree, it’ll probably happen before the deadline, but until then we are doing perfectly fine. No need to rush anything, we have literally nothing to lose. This is negadelphia, nobody expects chip. We almost certainly won’t get dame, but we have nothing to gain from trading him now. It’s not like Malik Beasley is going to be taken off the table. Fuck him, let him eat the fines. I’d take a 1% chance of a star over a 0% any day of the week"
We already had our representative fight a football player and got our ass beat.    [Sua Cravens vs. Malik Beasley](https://youtu.be/cH8araT0sBU)
The opposite actually.  Wolves stink because they don’t have many good players so no sense in wanting to trade for them.  We had to endure an entire offseason hearing about how great a package McDaniels and Malik Beasley were and it turns out those players aren’t even starting caliber
"I was joking, no one would take that deal lmao, same as that we didn’t take Malik Beasley"
After their Malik Beasley talk they can have shake and a top 15 protected first.
"Wolves fan’s “Ben for 2nd round pick and Malik Beasley seems more than fair because we can’t break up Ant, Kat, or DLo” talk all summer is pretty funny now."
But the fanbase is 100% behind letting him rot. Why would Morey panic? We spiteful mfers here in Philly. And if its confirmed that hes using this mental health excuse to escape getting fined for holding out then his top tier scumbag status will be confirmed and Morey can do whatever he wants.with the fuckface. Its not like Malik Beasley and a first is gonna turn us in to something we're not anyways.
"Collin Sexton, Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, and Malcom Brogdon. I'm sure other discussions have occurred. Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean no discussions have been taking place."
Wasn't it malik beasley?
wasn't it Malik Beasley?
How old is Malik Beasley???
malik beasley*
Malik Beasley is Pippens son?
malik beasley being one of them gotta hurt the ego even more  like not even an all star
"Facu was never going to be the first guard off the bench, but injury to Murray changed that. I think he was supposed to be low minutes energy guy, especially with shooters around him.  2 years ago Nuggets bench was: Monte, Malik Beasley, MPJ, Jerami Grant, and Plumdogg"
"C’s likely will be desperate, but they don’t really have assets to offer. If they do something huge like trading Brown, I have a hard time seeing that happening as a mid-season move. Basically, outside of Rob Will, they have Smart, who is looking overpaid, and a bunch of young guys who have failed to impress in the very few minutes they have actually played. Schroeder is nice for a contender this year I suppose. Maybe they could throw in some picks to get the table scraps as the third team, but like is Malik Beasley really a guy the Celtics need?"
i don't hate malik beasley I think he has mental issues he needs to work through  pat bev tho yeah he's kind of obnoxious
problem is we also have malik beasley and patbev on our team lmao  thankfully naz reid cancels them out

"Malik Beasley + PatBev don’t make the Sixers better, and neither does levert."
How about Malik Beasley wearing a Ant jersey?
He's leaving out the part where he was pointing guns at his 19 month old.   [https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/05/timberwolves-malik-beasley-accused-of-pointing-gun-in-general-direction-of-son/](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/05/timberwolves-malik-beasley-accused-of-pointing-gun-in-general-direction-of-son/)
"I thought this until we fucked around and let Malik Beasley play like prime MJ in the 4th quarter. Our perimeter defense is just not clicking yet, hopefully that will come once the COVID guys are fully recovered."
"The fact that Malik Beasley scored 22 points in the 4th quarter and there's isn't even a hint of a mention on this subreddit is actually insane.  How is there a highlight of Draymond attempting a 3, but no recognition at all for Beasley's legendary performance?"
So we're stuck with Captains RJ Barrett and Malik Beasley?

Single life treating Malik Beasley well this season.
Sure we lost but shoutout Malik Beasley that dude balled out!
Malik beasley is an all star. You all called him the worst 20 point scorer in the league?
"I switched to the Spurs Warriors game when we were up big and when I came back the lead is cut to 5 (and then 3). Man we really suck balls in the clutch.  &amp;#x200B;  Malik Beasley though, Hopefully Wolves turn it around soon."
I don’t care that we lost it was expected but Malik Beasley is the goat
Malik Beasley is the human torch
Malik Beasley legitimately just played one of the best quarters of basketball I’ve ever seen
"If Malik Beasley is averaging 20 and no one cares, I'd say no."
Malik Beasley is a legitimate MIP candidate but no one here cares because we have an awful record with our best player injured and our second best player playing every other game
We paid Malik Beasley 60/4 based on his 14 games with us where he averaged 20 ppg. That's the type of performance that gets you a big contract not playing 15 min per game on mediocre stats.
"I think that Minnesota says no. The team management seems to be really high on Dlo at PG, and Dlo and KAT are close.   I fully, 100% except that the Wolves will try to trade for Simmons, but I think the deal will be based around Malik Beasley with Rubio, Hernangomez, and/or Culver as salary filler."
"70% of the league will be calling Philly with trade offers trying to snag Simmons when his value is low. The question what type of player would the Sixers want in return. I think some type of 3 team trade where they send Simmons to the Twolves ,Lowry+ Malik Beasley to the Sixers, plus Rubio +cap filler and picks to the Raptors would work."
Ben for D.Fox  Ben for Malik Beasley and Rubio  Ben for Mitchell Rob and Bullock
"The only other player that would likely be a substitute centerpiece in discussions is Malik Beasley, I would imagine. That's assuming A1 is off limits, which, if he isn't, I'm almost certain Wolves fans would break Rosas' kneecaps in his sleep."
"bro, your team's roster has been so deep that you had Malik Beasley scrapping for minutes off the bench.   He came to the Wolves and was immediately one of our best players."
"Malik Beasley, Josh Okogie/Naz Reid and a 1st?"
Ricky Rubio and Malik Beasley you say.
"I imagine Malik Beasley will cover for the loss of shot creation. A1 is also only gonna get better, and he’s already pretty damn good."
Ey 6ers fans you want ricky rubio and malik beasley?
"Malik Beasley, Jaylen Nowell, Culver + a future first"
Malik Beasley for Simmons straight up who says no? 👀
"My Boy Malik Beasley got an Eskimo Brother in Future and Scottie Pippen. Malik is currently behind bars right now, go wolves"
"Even if it goes the absolute worst, that's still 3 picks. We drafted Jamal Murray, Juancho Hernangomez and Malik Beasley with almost those exact picks"
"How can you say we don't count because early picks (with 0 top 5 picks, 1 top 10 pick lol) and then cite drafting 3 MVPs who were all taken top 5? And no mention of Jokic round 2, literally the latest MVP ever drafted by 20 picks. Monte Morris(another round 2), Jamal and MPJ. Not even counting Nurkic, Gary Harris, Fournier, Malik Beasley (also round 2) Almost every player the Nuggets have taken for the last half decade has surpassed expectations. I don't see how two two lottery picks (both of which were home runs despite being late lottery picks) negates any of that.  Not saying OKC isn't a great FO but they're not ""easily the best drafting team."""
"A pick and Malik Beasley, sounds fair to me."
Malik Beasley escapes from jail 100%
"Wolves fan, what comes first? “Big Purr wants out” headline  “Malik Beasley gets out of jail” “Cade Cunningham refuses to play in Minnesota”"
Malik Beasley was a near 20ppg scorer last year you add that to your bench. They wouldnt need Suggs to come in and average 20ppg a game evenif he contributes 12/5/5 he spaces the floor significant better than Embiid. Of course your going to lose defense when trading Simmons but his offensive is just unplayable. This team goes as Embiid goes plus they have another really good player in Harris. If they got a little something out of Simmons this series would be over
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
"Lmao the recency bias here is real. Simmons is still a top 2 defender and an elite passer. OP can you please list 10 players better than him? Siakam, Brown, Ingram and maybe Sabonis have an argument to be selected over Ben. Then it's Murray, Hield, ...Levert? Dejounte Murray? Korkmaz? Malik Beasley? That's 10, and you still have 5 more players you would draft before him?  (I would take him 3rd behind Siakam and Brown)"
"What 3rd team would be willing to part with a good player that (1) helps the Sixers and (2) willingly helps the Wolves land Simmons in exchange for future picks?  I can only see Pistons and Rockets who are clearly hunting for young talent and have good pieces that don't fit their timeline - Christian Woods, Jerami Grant.  Wolves out: McDaniels, Beasley, Prince, 2x 1st round picks.  Wolves in: Ben Simmons  Pistons out: Jerami Grant,  Pistons in: Prince, McDaniels, 1st round pick  OR  Rockets out: Christian Wood,  Rockets in: Prince, McDaniels, 1st round pick  Sixers out: Ben Simmons  Sixers In: Jerami Grant/ Christian Wood, Malik Beasley + 1st round pick"
Spacing and outside shooting.  Malik Beasley: 39% 3 point shooter that can also create his own shot.
"Three-way where McDaniels, Minny picks, Maxey, and Sixers picks go to Detroit, and Malik Beasley and Jerami Grant go to Sixers. There's their third star and sixth man."
"Would have to be a three way trade that gets them a high quality guard or wing. I was thinking a trade where the Wolves get Simmons, the Sixers end up with Malik Beasley and Jerami Grant (and PatBev?), and the Pistons end up with assets from both teams (McDaniels, Maxey/Thybulle, picks, swaps, etc). Wolves could get Simmons without giving up DLo, Ant, or KAT, which they really want, and the Pistons are tanking, so the right package would entice them imo. And the Sixers are realy good with Curry/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid and Beasley as a sixth man."
"I never said that wasnt enough, you simply stated Malik Beasley isnt even a slightly attractive offer like a casual. I explained to you he is an attractive asset. Im not saying anything about the trade at all here."
"A sentiment I've heard and liked is Minny gets simmons, SAS gets picks and scrubs, 6ers get Dejounte and Malik Beasley"
It seems recently we have done well. You could add Jaden McDaniels and Malik Beasley to that as well. Now if we could somehow run a league average defense that would be cool.
"I look at this the same way as the Wolves trade. How do you convince Darryl to accept 60 cents for a dollar?   CJ is nice, he turns 30 in 2 weeks and has never been an all-star. Maybe playing PG instead of getting abused my big 2 guards in the playoffs or simply not being in the West is the change he needs. Sure, its better than Malik Beasley but that's not saying much.  It's reliant on a treasure trove of future picks going to a 3rd team who ostensibly has a right now asset that turns 60 cents into a dollar."
"I admire your optimism. What's your coach's previous experience again? I also think you would need to give up more than Malik Beasley. And you need more than one defensive player to have good team defense. As a Knicks fan, I know about unrealistic expectations."
"Timberwolves flip their backup PG/ SG duo for the perfect PF fit next to KAT and D'Lo  Blazers fix their backcourt issue and introduce size. Instead of a starting line-up of Dame/ CJ/ Powell they now run Dame/ Powell/ Jerami Grant and they also get a sixth man combo guard off the bench in Malik Beasley.  Sixers snag CJ who is a much better fit next to Embiid, they also snag a backup PF in Jaden McDaniels who should improve on his respectable rookie numbers, and they also get a future 1st from Minnesota that they can flip for a vet at the trade deadline to shore up any gaps they have.  Pistons get two first round picks for Jerami Grant who doesn't really fit their timeline."
"4 Team Trade  Minnesota Out: Malik Beasley, Beverley, McDaniels, three 1st round picks  Minnesota In: Ben Simmons   Sixers Out: Ben Simmons  Sixers In: CJ McCollum, McDaniels, 1x Timberwolves 1st round pick  Blazers Out: CJ McCollum  Blazers In: Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant  Detroit Pistons Out: Jerami Grant  Detroit Pistons In: Patrick Beverley, 2x Timberwolves first round picks"
What about Malik Beasley + Patrick Beverley + picks. I didnt realize this but Beasley averaged 19 pts with good efficiency this season
They'll have to be content to trade for Malik Beasley lol
"to think beasley is close to hield is just funny to me, cant believe how delusional a fanbase can be lmao. Malik has to be one of the lowest iq players i ever watched and his off the field issues are a major red flag."
"I actually do think Blazers take Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, 2 1sts for CJ McCollum, CJ's overpaid because he's forced to take a reduced role and they paid him for his talent level, which is greater than his role. Malik does 80% of CJ at 50% of the cost, for two more years then a team option, off ball. Taurean Prince is a feasibly switchable rotation player who gives you mildly efficient but not super productive play on both sides of the ball.   If you throw Naz Reid into the mix then you have a super young but productive backup big who is on a &lt;1st Round contract."
"Minnesota: Simmons Philadelphia: Damian Lillard Portland: 2022 FRP Minnesota, 2023 FRP Philadelphia, 2024 FRP Minnesota, 2025 FRP Philadelphia, Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, and Tyrese Maxey to Portland"
"I'll start,  Philly:  Malik Beasley   Wolves 1st 2024  Collin Sexton  Ricky Rubio  Cavaliers:  Jaden McDaniels  Patrick Beverley   Philly 1st 2022  Wolves 1st 2022  Minnesota  Ben Simmons"
"That would be good but idk if that gets the deal done. I agree with you and I feel like Nugs and Wolves, if they are the highest bidders will come away with a fleece for him. But I honestly think they’d take a package centered on Malik Beasley over that, which is still a pretty dry offer. It would probably be more likely for a desperate rebuilding team to win out over either of those two offers"
Is it? If Ant and D lo are off the table I’d rather have haliburton or Davion + Harrison Barnes than Malik Beasley and okogie
So who are you trading? Because I would rather have Brogdon than Malik Beasley and some Pringles.
"If there’s something worth trading for, makes sense.   But like Malik Beasley and change probably isn’t making it meaningfully farther past the 6 seed."
Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * McDaniels  * Prince  * Maxey  * 2 Wolves 1sts  * 2 Sixers 1sts
"Who says no?   Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Naz Reid  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * 2023, 2025 Sixers 1sts  * 2023, 2025 Wolves 1sts   * 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 Sixers pick swap options  Sixers get a championship roster top to bottom. Beverley/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man is FILTHY.   Wolves get Ben without giving up D'Lo, Ant, or KAT. D'Lo/Curry/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a good ass team  Pistons flip their star to launch their rebuild forward. They get four great prospects, four 1sts, and four pick swaps (two of which will probably be really valuable down the line once Embiid and Harris are old)."
Actually malik Beasley would be a solid 3rd option. Tobias needs to step up
Sixers get:   * CJ McCollum  * Patrick Beverley  * Naz Reid  * Wolves 2023 1st   Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Blazers get:   * Matisse Thybulle  * Malik Beasley  * Jaden McDaniels  * Jake Layman
"Ant has more value than Simmons on his own.   Wolves have DLo, Malik Beasley, expirings, and picks."
"Did it ever occur to you that maybe we didn’t want ben simmons  Besides, your package failed because you didn’t want to give up maxey. Now enjoy malik beasley and pat bev while the nets with harden run a train on your conference until embiid wants out"
"Wolves: Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe  76ers: Kristaps Porzingis, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Tyrell Terry  Mavs: Patrick Beverly, Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey"
Enjoy Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels
"&gt;Some combination of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Ried, multiple big expiring contracts (Taurean Prince or Patrick Beverley), and/or multiple future 1sts.  LOL"
So who tf are they trading? Pat Bev and Josh Okogie?   Edit: Malik Beasley exists but my point still stands
"Some combination of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Ried, multiple big expiring contracts (Taurean Prince or Patrick Beverley), and/or multiple future 1sts."
Y’all bout to get Ben for Malik Beasley straight up lmao
never said that but he's an objectively better player than malik beasley.
"Malik Beasley, Pat Bev (so would have to wait a month before this could go through, I think) McDaniels and some picks probably is the best I could see the Wolves offering. Doubt that ends up being the best offer."
lol oops... that's supposed to be Malik Beasley
"CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Derrick White, Thaddeus Young, Lonnie Walker, 2024 unprotected 1st, 2025 swap, 2025 bulls 1st  Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverly, Okogie, 2022 pick swap, 2023 Unprotected 1st, 2025 unprotected 1st  Tyrese Halliburton, Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley, 2022 pick swap, 2023 1st, 2025 1st  I’m still acting as if he’s a positive asset. I think most of these deals are fair-ish and realistic"
"I think Minnesota's hypothetical offer of Beasley, Bev, and up to 2 picks (could be 1 pick, could be a pick and a swap, you get the idea) still outbids them unless it's CJ *and picks.*  Beverley alone gives Philly a G *that can shoot* to stand in the corner instead of the dunker spot with Seth, Tobi, and Embiid. That gets them past Atlanta on its own. And he's a good defender against anyone shorter than 6'6"". And then you replace the Furkan Korkmaz/George Hill minutes with Malik Beasley and that's good spacing for Embiid"
Malik Beasley gonna look great in white
Malik Beasley and Malik Monk
"&gt; LeVert's indiana stats are more important because he came off the bench in Brooklyn playing 27 minutes, in contrast to Barrett playing 34 minutes as a starter  Ok I get that for box score stats but not sure why the minutes matter for his ts% which would be lower than RJ’s if you included the whole season.  &gt; I think you are massively undervaluing 3.1 ppg and 1.9 apg - 3.1 ppg is the difference between Paul George and Malik Beasley, 1.9 apg is the difference between Jokic and Kevin Porter Jr.  Sure but 3.1 ppg is also the difference between Tatum/Mitchell and PG. Judging by the comments in the Tatum vs PG thread, I think people would downplay how much significance that gap is in that context. 1.2 more rpg is also notably more.  &gt; I'm not sure why it's being assumed that defensive advanced stats are the prime indicator of effectiveness.   That wasn’t my point. You said in your initial comment “You can point out defense, eye test etc. but all advanced stats and tape strongly backs up that the stats tell an accurate story here.”  I was showing that “all” the advanced stats don’t strongly back up those stats. LeVert may have averaged more steals for example, but advanced defensive stats don’t back up the claim that he’s a better defender based on that fact. I’m aware there are other stats that have LeVert over RJ but you referred to “all” advanced stats, and I was pointing to the ones that don’t support your claim."
"LeVert's indiana stats are more important because he came off the bench in Brooklyn playing 27 minutes, in contrast to Barrett playing 34 minutes as a starter.  I think you are massively undervaluing 3.1 ppg and 1.9 apg - 3.1 ppg is the difference between Paul George and Malik Beasley, 1.9 apg is the difference between Jokic and Kevin Porter Jr.  But putting box score aside, I'm not sure why it's being assumed that defensive advanced stats are the prime indicator of effectiveness. Why not mention that LeVert's overall EPM is four times greater than Barrett's or that his LEBRON is almost double Barrett's, or that his RPM is roughly 87% higher? Yes, Barrett has strengths over LeVert, but you are selectively applying certain advanced stats while downplaying others to make your point."
"This is what the article said  ""The Timberwolves have been motivated to find a deal for Simmons but would likely require a third team given their asset pool of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and D’Angelo Russell might not entice the 76ers.""  It never said they offered all 3"
"&gt; The Timberwolves have been motivated to find a deal for Simmons but would likely require a third team given their asset pool of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and D’Angelo Russell might not entice the 76ers.  Jesus that's way to much for Simmons. Guy can't fucking shoot. Not worth those three."
"""The Timberwolves have been motivated to find a deal for Simmons but would likely require a third team given their asset pool of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and D’Angelo Russell might not entice the 76ers""  Am I the only one who doesn't think this is a bad package? Obviously doesn't make them better as a Dame would but that it's not that bad"
"&gt;If you trade Dame, there is absolutely no reason you should hold onto Simmons. It would be a 3 team deal with Simmons going to a place like Minnesota and all of those assets going back to Portland.  Oh yeah im sure Portland is gonna be super happy building around Malik Beasley and a bunch of late picks"
what assets does Minnesota have? You think portland wants to rebuild around Malik Beasley?
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
Like when Malik Beasley banged pippens wife
"This substitution by Stotts won the Blazers the series basically.  Still will never understand why Malik Beasley wasn't subbed in for Denver after like OT2 or something. Like yeah, you'd rather run with your best players, but after 50 minutes maybe your 5th best guy isn't your 5th best guy anymore"
we easily give up D-LO before Beasley. Gerson loves malik
&gt;you’ll want a player with a higher ceiling  Which player is the centrepiece from Portland’s perspective in a three team trade? Which player are they building around? Thybulle? Malik Beasley?
"No, he hasn't received any new charges. [He was just released early from his 120 day sentence, and is on probation until Feb 2024](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2021/08/17/timberwolves-guard-malik-beasley-released-from-jail/). He also completed his 12 game suspension by the NBA at the end of last season. So he is essentially free to go about his life as an NBA player as long as he adheres to the terms of probation, [which are no use of alcohol or drugs and mandatory completion of an anger management program](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/timberwolves-malik-beasley-sentenced-to-120-days-in-jail-following-2020-arrest/)."
LiAngelo Ball  Malik Beasley  JR Smith
But then what can you offer the 3rd team to make them give a great piece? It’s not like teams are knocking down the door for Malik Beasley or Taurean Prince. Best I can see is maybe Hield and the Kings won’t help the Wolves get Simmons.
I mean yea they are interested in fleecing philly. Why wouldn’t they? But no trade is gonna happen between these two teams philly wants someone that will help them win now or a package that will help them trade for someone who can help them win now. While the twolves don’t want to give up any of their actual valuable pieces in dlo or ant and instead want to offer something like Malik Beasley(who just got out of jail I should add) and Jaden McDaniels(cool 3 and D prospect but nothing crazy to be fair) and a couple of first which if they get Ben shouldn’t even be that good. Trade makes 0 sense for philly so it will never happen they’d be better off taking Cj and a pick or so from Portland.
Malik Beasley —&gt; Duncan Robinson —-&gt; Klay Thompson   Catch and shoot 3’s
Ofc. Malik Beasley.
"Cope harder Philly goofball. We're fine and our fanbase has not been this happy with the team since the summer before Hayward's injury, find a new slant.   It's clear that Brad has done what Danny wouldn't do and committed to building around JB and JT. He's also signing guys to tradable deals so we can acquire a third star.   Maybe instead of worrying about us you should worry more about how you're gonna get Malik Beasley and bad filler contracts for Simmons and start praying to god that Embiid miraculously stops getting hurt every six months.   Sixers will be rebuilding in two years, mark my words."
"DENVER NUGGETS  PG: D.J. Augustin   SG: Andre Iguodala   SF: Carmelo Anthony   PF: Danilo Gallinari   C: Mason Plumlee  BENCH: Paul Millsap, Gary Harris, JaVale McGee, Trey Lyles, Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant"
KAT  Ant  Jaden McDaniels  Malik Beasley  Naz Reid
Both are still 24 and 25. Still young.   Anthony Edwards is coming of a ROY type season.   Malik Beasley is only 24 coming off of averaging 19 a game.   I think they trade one of D-Lo and Beasley tho.
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
Jayden Mcdaniels and Malik Beasley as well
Malik Beasley will smoke his ass
Malik Beasley has entered the chat
"If Sixers want to win in Embiid's window, they shouldn't look for 3 1sts. Two solid role players ie Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels is what they need.  The Big 3 of DLo, KAT and Ben looks solid. Three all-stars at the age of 25, sheesh. The wolves are gonna be a problem in the West for years to come"
once malik beasley can stay away from pregnant women the league is fucked
"&gt; Blazers get: (from Minny) Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, LeAndro Bolmaro   LMAO."
"If all we’re getting back is Malik Beasley and picks them it still wastes a year, probably multiple years, of Embiid’s prime"
"His value is already low as shit, there’s no reason to trade him now. Malik Beasley is not gonna do shit for us so why would we trade for him? It’s better to wait and see if we can get something better at the deadline instead of trading him for peanuts."
"Every time I hear about Minny’s package, I’m surprised that they think they can get it done. I would rather have what the Kings are selling, or McCollum or Brogdon.  Hell, if you want Malik Beasley I’ll give you Dorian Finney Smith and call it a day lol (I know cap doesn’t work)"
"Blowout trade:   Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Raptors get:   * Tobias Harris  * Matisse Thybulle  * Jaden McDaniels  * Taurean Prince  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts  Sixers run VanVleet/Cury/Green/Siakam/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man. That's a great, well-built roster (better than trying to force Siakam/Harris to play together)  Timberwolves get Ben for their assets, as they desire  Raptors move Pascal (which it's been hinted they want to do) for McDaniels and Matisse, who both fit their prospect profile to a T, plus Tobias Harris to fill in for Siakam -- they can flip him later for more assets. In the mean time, they run Dragic/GTJ/OG/Harris/Boucher with Flynn/Thybulle/McDaniels/Barnes/Precious off the bench. Plus some draft capital to play with"
"What the fuck are the Sixers gonna do with Malik Beasley and 2-3 firsts from Minnesota? Lose in the second round again at best? The point is to not waste Embiid’s prime, that’s the **entire reason** the Sixers have the worse hand. If the return we get for Ben doesn’t help us not waste Embiid, we might as well start fielding offers for Joel."
Does getting malik Beasley really move the needle to making us contenders?
People want to see a trade so bad that they think Morey is a complete idiot for not accepting a Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield trade like that moves the needle at all for the Sixers’ playoff chances
" I think it's the same logic that Sixers used for the process. We could've decided to be a mediocre team for a couple years, or be bad for a couple years in exchange for being very good for a couple years. We chose the latter.   Now it's let the locker room potentially get uncomfortable for a couple months, in exchange for a better return, or go for the immediate mediocre return and probably close any Championship window for the forseeable future.   I just don't get why everyone would choose the latter option in this scenario. The only argument really is if Embiid asks out because of it, but there's no indication that's on the table really. And I think Embiid probably asks out eventually anyway if we're replacing Ben with Malik Beasley and a sophomore."
"Timberwolves get: Ben Simmons  76ers get: Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and Markelle Fultz  Magic get: Patrick Beverley and Jaylen Nowell  I am not even going to pretend I’ve watched half these players and just matched money for “lol Fultz back to 76ers”  Who even would win this trade?"
"As a Hornets fan, I’d be willing to give Hayward to Philly if we could get at least one unprotected Minnesota pick + McDaniels + Naz Reid. Hayward played really well last year (best player on our team), but his timeline doesn’t match ours and his contract could age poorly. McDaniels/Reid would give us a great young core and some depth at forward, plus I’m not all that into Kai Jones/Vernon Carey/JT Thor as our Cs of the future.   This take will be more controversial amongst our fanbase, but I’d give Terry to Philly too if it meant getting Malik Beasley, Terry/Beasley occupy a similar niche but Beasley is younger and cheaper."
Waste?  Relative to what?  Another second round exit fueled by missed Ben Simmons missed free throws?   Malik Beasley running our offense?  Going all in on an Embiid/Harris/McCollum core?  Lol.  I’d rather let Maxey and the young guys develop and keep the asset.  We’re over the cap regardless and the same shitty trades will be there in 3 years.
"They should hold at least until the end of the season if the best offers are trash like Buddy Hield or Malik Beasley.  For all the whining about holding Simmons is wasting Embiid’s prime, all of the current offers don’t make this team a contender or anywhere close, so it doesn’t hurt at all to wait"
"Yes i am sure and thinking otherwise is stupid. Why are you not sure of that when its widely publicized the Wolves want him bad and the offer thats continually floated is malik beasley, pat bev, jaden mcdaniels and 2 1sts?"
Yeah god forbid that Malik Beasley + a first goes off the table
The amount of people on this sub chomping at the bit to trade Simmons for Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels is staggering
"&gt; They could be worse.  They could not lol. His value is as low as it gets. Terrible playoff performance, vocal trade request, and almost no substantial rumors. Like at some point we have to match saleries to make a trade, Buddy Heild and Malik Beasley are probably as low as it can go and that's where we're at now"
Well agree to disagree. I think you play to win a championship. Malik Beasley isn’t winning us a championship. Dame does. So I’ll take a 10% chance at him over a role player any day.
Why would his value go down? I mean his current value is Malik Beasley or John Wall. What’s lower than that?
"The offers are likely to get better because the market will change. Teams will underachieve, players wont like their situations, etc. Right now every team is happy with what they have and are only willing to trade us scraps. If we wait a few months, the market likely changes and we can do a little better than Malik Beasley and filler"
Trading him for Malik Beasley == sacrificing multiple seasons
If Lillard asked out how many teams would be able to put together a package better than Simmons-Maxey-Thybulle- 4 firsts and 3 swaps together?  Or if you prefer solely picks Malik Beasley-Maxey-Thybulle-McDaniels 3 Wolves picks and 4 Sixers picks &amp; swaps.    The Sixers are one of the few contenders with control of their picks.  I don’t see many teams having an offer that competes
"What if the bulls suck this year? Lavine said how they performed this season would be important regarding whether or not he resigns, implying that he may leave if they have another bad season. If that’s looking like the case, the bulls may flip Lavine for Simmons. Maybe there’s a 2% chance that happens, but I’d take that over Malik Beasley and a couple picks. It’s not like that offer is going anywhere"
"If you don’t think Sixers fans have been loyal to Simmons for the last five years, you truly have no idea what you’re talking about.  Things came to a head after a historically bad playoff performance after years of him not working on his game.  The idea that you think he should have no accountability for his performance says a lot.  He’s essentially blaming everyone else for his own shortcomings.   In terms of who?  We have him under contract for four years.  We have time to figure out a better deal than Malik Beasley and picks."
"I agree with you, but that's not what I'm pointing out.. take AD for example, Rich Paul/AD did something similar in a public manner but a key difference is they never threatened to sit out, he did indeed play games afterwards and just passive aggressively indicated things like the 'That's All Folks' t-shirt. So there was always a sense that going into AD's next season would degrade if he acted out on the court, in the locker room, etc.  With Ben Simmons, they already threatened the worst case scenario in saying he won't show up to even train or play. Every GM around the league is acting accordingly. There is no threat of anything worse or any further damage to perception because it's already been done. How could the 76ers position get any worse? 76ers are almost better off just waiting and seeing if he changes his mind as the millions tick away.  To your point about lowering his value by the way, IMO the 76ers' position is so bad that they aren't even getting any material players back for Ben Simmons. I admit it was probably hard for Ben/Rich Paul to foresee this but if Malik Beasley is the centerpiece of a trade for Ben Simmons then if I'm the 76ers I can wait 4 years until his contract his over, honestly."
"Ben Simmons ain't going to the T Wolves for Malik Beasley and Pat Bev btw, regardless of how much reddit GMing and posturing you do"
"Kevin ""Hawks want to trade for Malik Beasley"" O'Conner."
"Crazy how people think they are still getting a star when his value tanks daily  They are ultimately gonna end up with a package of Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and 2 first round picks"
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
They literally traded Malik Beasley for less than his value because they couldn't afford to pay him and their other draft hits
"Yeah and this is why it’s ridiculous people want us to trade for some garbage like Malik Beasley and picks.  The upside of this somehow working out and Ben coming back, even though it’s got a 1% chance, is so vastly better than our ceiling with these random filler plus picks trades"
Sixers are gonna get like Malik Beasley and picks and you’re gonna have a real tough day
"&gt;The longer this gets dragged out, the worse the return in any trade is going to be.  You can only go so low. Like, you have to match salaries at the very least. Do people think in a month we're going to be attaching picks and our young players to get off Ben? He's still a good player lol. Harden, Kyrie, AD, and Vince Carter all got traded eventually. Teams still have to meet us somewhere in the middle. You think Malik Beasley eventually comes off the table and all the Wolves offer is Beverly and Prince for Simmons, Maxey, and picks lol? Just doesn't make sense unless you're looking to trade a veteran on a huge contract. His value can't go lower IMO"
"&gt; just that Sixers are trying to go off his value on paper but it's the playoffs eye test that makes their high asking price a reach.  I'd argue Daryl Morey is more of a realist than thinking we're going to get a star player in return for Ben who shot 33% from the FT line in the playoffs. GM's do this for a living, they can weigh the whole picture. I doubt we're pricing ourselves out of any deal, we're just banking on Buddy Heild and Malik Beasley being available for the foreseeable future.   That's the whole point of Bodner's quote, we are mostly likely going to receive a package with 1 starter level player, a few picks, and maybe a young player if we're lucky and salary filler if not. Our front office has already surveyed the entire league, they know what his value is lol"
"&gt; He can still be a very good player, just not for you guys anymore. That much is clear.  Sure but if you work in a front office you're not going to pretend he literally brings nothing to your team. Especially for the Wolves and Cavs who are years away from contending in the playoffs anyway. You have to match salary, you can't just trade your 15th guy and get Simmons in return, at some point we will receive players/picks in return.  &gt;You mean a 24 year old 20ppg scorer making 15m/y?  Good player and probably a starter for us but that's your baseline. IMO Beasley is about as low as you can get. Buddy Heild and Malik Beasley are available players, I just don't see why the season would turn out so great for the kings/Wolves that suddenly they're off the table in a month.   &gt;After a year or two that's exactly what will happen.  Lol Ben Simmons will be gone by the deadline at the very latest, Morey has been a GM for 15+ years he's not dumb enough to sit him a whole season, most people are just hoping we can make it to December when more players are available to be included in a trade. You're talking about Ben becoming a massively negative asset where we can't even trade him and that's ridiculous to me. No, we're not going to sit him for 2 years in Embiid's prime lol we just want to wait a little longer before biting the bullet. And right now it seems that the opportunity cost of doing so is with team chemistry, not what's available on the market.  Yes there will absolutely be more drama with training camp and the start of the season, but that's just noise. Butler got traded, AD got traded, Harden got traded, Kyrie got traded, and all for more or less reasonable value. Throwing a fit doesn't tank what you get in return but shooting 33% from the FT absolutely does. GM's aren't caught up in the news cycle, I'm sure they are able to weigh the positives and negatives and if we REALLY wanted Ben gone we could find a deal with Minnesota like Bodner is talking about. It's really not that crazy to proceed with caution for a player that doesn't have a huge market anyway. Saying it can get lower doesn't make a lick of sense to me, you're imagining a month from now the sixers trading Ben + Maxey + picks for Goran Dragic or something?"
"He can still be a very good player, just not for you guys anymore. That much is clear.   &gt;Malik Beasley as the best player in a package.  You mean a 24 year old 20ppg scorer making 15m/y?  &gt; We'll never have to attach picks and stuff just to get off his contract  After a year or two that's exactly what will happen. You'll be asking teams who haven't seen him play for 2 years to take a gamble on him the same way the Wizards (and now Rockets) have asked teams to take a gamble on John Wall.   ""We can just hold onto him forever"" and ""he'll cave and come back to play at a high level"" aren't realistic expectations.  40m on the bench in street clothes is 40m on the bench in street clothes."
"Bit of an overreation lol. He's still a very good player, could win DPOY in the next few seasons. Really don't think the market can go lower, we're already being offered Malik Beasley as the best player in a package. He makes a lot of money, you still need to match salary. He is literally unwanted by almost every team, this is the lowest it can go without being disrespectful. We'll never have to attach picks and stuff just to get off his contract"
They're both much better than a trade centered on Malik Beasley and some picks lol
Hello Malik Beasley and picks
"Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons   Sixers get:   * Beverley   * Malik Beasley   * Colin Sexton  * 2026, 2028 Minny 1sts (top 5 protected)  Cavaliers get:   * Jaden McDaniels   * Tyrese Maxey   * 2022, 2024 Minny 1sts (top 5 protected)"

"Would love to know what everyone else thinks we should've done lol. His value is at its absolute lowest, it cannot get any better and that's been the case for a while now. Either we're taking a bad package of Buddy Heild or Malik Beasley, there aren't alternatives that we've just turned down. I am fine waiting until it's truly untenable and we start losing too many games. Until then we're not forgoing something great, we're just waiting in the hopes that another option emerges. Morey has been a GM for 15+ years, I'm sure he knows what he's doing. The idea that he's just been asking for the world and being stubborn is dumb, he knows we don't really have much of anything on the table so why not wait? Nobody wants to trade for Ben, that's the issue here. Morey can only try to maximize his value"
"Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and a 1st round pick  Its happening"
"Malik Beasley too lol (I guess he's matching salary, though)"
"Malik Beasley doesn’t make the Sixers better than they are with Ben. That’s obvious. Anything that says he is is based on Ben wanting to leave and as the OP said, Morey doesn’t care about that"
