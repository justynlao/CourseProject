Is Lamar Stevens rich? I don't think so.
We've been missing three of our starters for most of the season.  Like half of our rotation was injured at one point and we were playing Lamar Stevens and Dean Wade 20 minutes per game.  We were running McGee/Maker/Drummond lineups lol.
"29th ranked offense didn't have Sexton, Garland, Windler, Prince, Allen, and Love but he's still missing. Bickerstaff was forced to play Dotson and Cedi at point and Dean Wade, Marques Bolden, Thon Maker, and Lamar Stevens had to play more minutes than they're supposed to. I'd be surprised if you know who those players are aside from Thon."
Penn State legend Lamar Stevens!
"if the league wants to take a break for a week, we'd really appreciate that.  a lineup of Yogi Ferrell, Damyean Dotson, Lamar Stevens, Dean Wade and Javale Mcgee sharing the floor in the first quarter is a thing of nightmares."

as cavs assistant gm on a burner account i would like to announce we will trade lamar stevens for 3 fries and a mcflurry
Very glad Lamar Stevens is playing over the other bench dregs.
We got a few on the Cavs:  Scoochie Smith (all time top preseason player name)  Damyean Dotson  DWade ( Dean Wade )  Cedi Osman  Lamar Stevens  Iaasac Okoro   There‚Äôs honestly more but these are just a few who come to mind

Lamar Stevens
The Lamar Stevens era begins
"[Lamar Stevens](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1324040845125804032/9OMIgrte_400x400.jpg), and [Evan Turner.](https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nba/players/full/4239.png)  I don't know, maybe the eyes"
"Go back and look at that roster. It wasn't nearly as bad as the Cavs this year, and even the rookies were future starters and all stars. Not sure you can say the same for Lamar Stevens, Dean Wade, Cedi, etc"
"Cavs: Garland, Sexton, Okoro, start like every game and we‚Äôre drafted by us.   Then we have Cedi OsMan (draft night sign and trade), Dylan Windler, 26th pick.   If you count undrafted players who we picked up and play for us: Mathew Dellavedova, Lamar Stevens, Broderick Thomas, Dean Wade.   Aside from Delly, all these players get decent minutes too"
Larry Nance. Lamar Stevens also but he's been out of the rotation lately
"Half our roster is first and second year players so most of them honestly.   Lamar Stevens, Broderick Thomas, D Wade"
The best answer is to play all 4 of our young guards and stagger their minutes.   Our current line up:   DG-Sexton- Okoro probably start (especially early in the season)   Then bench DG to bring in Cade: so we have Sexton- Okoro- Cade this way Cade gets some playmaking experience against the starters of opposing teams   Have DG run the bench unit with Cade: he needs some off ball experience sitting either Sexton or Okoro depending on who needs rest.   Basically just cycle the 4 players in 3 spots giving one a break.   But please note we have several young players who we are training up: Broderick Thomas- Lamar Stevens- Dean Wade - Dylan Windler
"I guess we‚Äôd protect Sexton, Garland, Okoro, Allen, Nance, Hartenstein, Dean Wade, and Lamar Stevens. Have fun with Cedi and Kevin Love!"
"Forgot about noted Penn State legend Lamar Stevens, he can stay"
What about Lamar Stevens and Dean Wade?
"Its all subjective and there are many albums that could be the best of all time, but I wouldn't have my top list all be dadrock albums lol. Some albums that are among the best of all time:  Carrie and Lowell - Sufjan Stevens  My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - Kanye  Pure Herione - Lorde  Is this it? - The Strokes  To Pimp a Butterfly - Kendrick Lamar"
I think Lamar Stevens gonna stick around for a long time
Lamar stevens has fucking iced out Mobley like 6 times now....
"As a Cavs fan, I'd take LeBron for Brodric Thomas and Lamar Stevens."
Larry Nance with a deeper cut of Lamar Stevens.  Cedi bricked his way out of his status this year.
Lamar Even Stevens
Don‚Äôt forget Lamar stevens
"1. the cavs currently have players like isaiah hartenstein, jeremiah martin, lamar stevens, brodric thomas, dean wade, and dylan windler on the roster. Cutting one of them is completely free and wouldn't cost first rounders. (I might've made up one of those names, you wouldn't be able to tell.)  2. You are not getting assets for kevin love, you are giving up assets to give up kevin love.  3. Better fitting pieces as in other teams crap they throw in to match salary? Again look at #2 Kevin love is a negative value, you will give not get anything worthwhile.  I'd also like to add the cavs are not over the luxury tax, they are not competing this year or the next, and that sending kevin love home for the season ala Al Horford on OKC would accomplish the same thing as your hare brained scheme and not cost them picks/actual contributing players to their future."
"He's not. We're running Okoro at the 3, but Mobley, Cedi, and I guess Lauri now can cover some minutes, as will Lamar Stevens"
Lamar Stevens off the bench did a great job stepping up for Okoro who was out. Locked him up.
Lamar Stevens also had fantastic defense on him in the clutch.
"I'll try to answer this as simply as possible.  &gt; My question Is, what the heck is going on with SexLand? Is the team more into Sexton or Garland? Who will they keep  If you play close attention, Garland and Sexton almost **never** share the court together. On average, it may be about 10-12 minutes a night they do to keep their defensive disadvantages hidden as both Rubio and Okoro are average to plus defenders for their position.   Furthermore, Sexton plays very well off Rubio and has actually showed some of the best off-ball play and ball movement of his entire career, albeit early. Garland does really well with Okoro and Rubio, as well as Sexton in certain roles.  I believe the Cavs prefer Garland over Sexton but if Collin continues to show growth off-ball, I have a strong feeling both will be Cavaliers for a decent amount of time.   &gt; What do you guys think the plan is? Yall now have a transcendent talent in Mobley, can't F this up..  The plan is pretty simple. We badly need to acquire a rotational SF. Our guard core of Garland, Sexton, Rubio and Okoro is solid enough to win games, as is our big man core of Allen, Mobley and Markkaken.   If Dylan Windler was healthy, perhaps he could alleviate some of the issues we have at the position but so far he's been nothing but injured during his first few seasons. Cedi Osman and Lamar Stevens are also not starting caliber SFs.   I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs acquired a SF before the deadline. In a perfect world I'd trade any amount of picks for Brandon Ingram. He'd fit so beautifully in this lineup.   I would also strongly consider re-signing Ricky Rubio as he's probably the best backup PG in the league and provides the veteran leadership this tram needs.  &gt; Also do you guys like all the 6'10+ guys you have? What do you think of Lauri and starting at the 3spot?  I dislike Kevin Love because he's bad bit to his credit he played well against Atlanta. Tacko Fall is fun but also very bad.  Lauri has surprisingly done pretty well at the 3 spot. In certain situations the lineup has been very affective. However, whenever we swap out one of Mobley, Allen or Lauri with Love, it falls apart.   &gt; Ps why the F is love still here?  We're not going to buy him out unless it's a significant discount. So that won't happen. And no one wants him until next year when he's a valuable expiring before an excellent free agent class."

lamar stevens
"They should trade Luka for quality 3 and D wings to surround Boban with, someone like Denzel Valentine and Lamar Stevens."
Lamar Stevens catches some poo.
"We honestly don‚Äôt have any hated players (other than the anti-Sexton fans), but I‚Äôd say the trio of Lamar Stevens, Okoro and Valentine can be extremely frustrating on offense. They all have very solid defense but are black holes on the other side of the court"
"Alright, give us Lamar Stevens and the ghost of Richard Jefferson"
If I have to watch one more second of Lamar Stevens and Denzel Valentine so help me god.
"Jarrett Allen has been out sick, Markkenan has been in Covid protocols,  Mobley has a sprained elbow,  Sexton has a torn meniscus,  Cedi hurt his back and  Lamar Stevens has a knee injury"
6 Lamar Stevens too
"Yeah Allen is sick, Mobley hurt his elbow last game, Lauri is out with covid and this with Love's first game back from covid. Lamar Stevens also out along with Sexton's knee injury"
"Cavs have a lot to be happy about. They stayed competitive until the last 2 minutes while missing Allen/Sexton/Markennan/Love and Lamar Stevens (bleh). Losing Sexton is really going to hurt this team's offensive flow for awhile because of his burst and relentless attack that keeps opposing defenses on their heels, but it's clearly going to be Garland's time to shine. He was already super talented, but now he's learning how to be a NBA point guard - only real weakness is his size.     As for Mobley - the kid had his first bad game. He's leading the league in contested shots per game and I imagine he will continue to impress defensively while his offensive game improves. Get some meat on him - he's already got the package, including beautiful form on his jumper and post footwork. ROTY is his and/or Scottie Barnes to take at this juncture IMO."
"Nah, no way.  Markkanen has shot terribly this year but he showed actual toughness and grit.  And there's no way that he's not better than Dean Wade, Kevin Love, or Lamar Stevens."
and lamar stevens
Yes we will take LeBron back in Cleveland in exchange for Lamar Stevens.
I want us to give Kyle some run. We could use more shooting and I'd honestly rather have him playing than Lamar Stevens.
"The duality of Cedi Osman. You either get Lebron lite or you get SF Westbrick.  Also, unrelated, but Lamar Stevens does not belong in the NBA."
"Did anyone see this coming? It feels like only yesterday the Cavs picked Evan Mobley, traded for Rubio, brought in Markannen, and then we all heard that the roster was going to start with three near 7-footers and thought to ourselves ""no way that'll work."" The [preseason power ranker predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qcvtja/202122_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) did not. No one thought Mobley would be a ROY candidate, JA might be a MIP candidate given the way things are going, and no one put them down for most surprising team. They're definitely surprising us now.  Tricky Ricky's playing better than ever (having so many roll threats must be a dream scenario for him), Mobley was amazing right out of the gate, Jarrett Allen has exceeded expectations, and Lauri provides spacing (I guess).  I do worry a little about depth. Sexton's about to be out, which could be withstood by moving up Ricky or playing D. Wade. Love has only played a little. Markannen is also temporarily out. Windler, the other D. Wade, and Lamar Stevens seem like decent depth, and JA/Mobley are more than enough to cover for Markannen's temporary absence. However, losing either JA or Mobley would be huge hit to the rim protection and defense, kind of like if we lost Rudy, so I'm going to hope they both stay healthy for the whole season."
Lamar Stevens of all people leads with a +9 in 9 minutes.
"He's not good. His value is in being a high energy guy. His skill set along with his size doesnt make him a fit on a good, deep NBA roster. Our wing depth is just that weak right now. Okoro is hurt, and a bit undersized when he is out there. Cedi Osman just got a DNP-CD in *favor* of Lamar Stevens, Denzel Valentine was our big wing free agent signing and he can't seem to crack our lineup, and Dylan Windler is a total question mark who's just getting back from his third injury stint in as many years.   Were not starting Markkanen just to be quirky. It's a necessity thing too."
Lamar Stevens does not belong in the NBA.
I have one Lamar Stevens for you.
Lamar Stevens scored
Cavs fans‚Ä¶ I really need to know if Lamar Stevens is usually this bad? He was bad offensively and defensively. I was convinced Cavs wanted to lose by them playing him.
"I like Evan Mobley. I like watching the Cavs play intense basketball teams against good teams again. I don't like whatever Lamar Stevens was doing on offense tonight, I missed Okoro.  Garland gave the Cavs the lead with 7:51 left in the 4th and after that the Lakers absolutely took over that game like a championship level team should. It wasn't pretty, but Lakers fans should be happy with how they closed that out.  I wanted the win, but I'm glad this team finally has an identity. They're young and I think they learned a lot from this one."
