Pels got killed by Mason Plumlee &amp; Svi Mykhailiuk
Svi Mykhailiuk is still available
My favorite thing about Svi Mykhailiuk is how much his English speaking accent changed in college.  [Svi when he first came to America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLepVW4-Mf0)  [Svi after 4 years on a college basketball team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvBXVoOIdRg)
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here. THT, Kuz, Hart, Nance, etc. Only 2 out and out bad picks.  46	LAL	Talen Horton-Tucker 25	LAL	Moritz Wagner 39	LAL	Isaac Bonga 47	LAL	Svi Mykhailiuk 27	LAL	Kyle Kuzma 30	LAL	Josh Hart 42	LAL	Thomas Bryant 32	LAL	Ivica Zubac 27	LAL	Larry Nance Jr. 34	LAL	Anthony Brown 46	LAL	Jordan Clarkson"
Svi Mykhailiuk and Larry Nance
"Lonzo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivica Zubac.   Jordan Clarkson, Svi Mykhailiuk Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, Thomas Bryant."
"Those are pro players he's playing against which is even crazier. Aaron Holiday, Svi Mykhailiuk, Kenrich Williams, Mike James, Lonnie Walker, Rajon Rondo, and Quincy Pondexter."
"Mentioned in another thread, going by Eric Gordon's new comments, it feels like we're at the part after a superstar trade where fans and the other teammates convince themselves that trading one of the Top 6 talents in the league is actually *good* for the team.  It's not.  Then the team implodes because the star made the mish-mash group of players work and everything implodes around the franchise.  If I'm the Nets I'm not too concerned about Harden and Durant resigning when their deals are up. I'd be more concerned about Kyrie, and if I'm the Nets, I try to trade him.  If I'm them, I wouldn't expect fair value, just go for depth; a solid G who can play D or hold the fort till Dinwiddie returns, a C that can do the same, and another F that can score a bit, etc.  I also mentioned other day that I thought DET could be a landing spot for Kyrie, and after GM's recent comments, it wouldn't surprise me.  If DET offered Rose (or Svi Mykhailiuk), Jerami Grant, and Mason Plumlee, Nets consider that if they think Kyrie won't fit, no? Does DET have an extra first from another team they can throw in?  That's the kind of depth trade I mean. Get some/any value you can back. And DET, it's a chance at relevancy/maybe a higher ceiling than they currently have. It's going to be hard for them to get that level of star otherwise. Maybe he and Blake work decent or sell some tickets."
"What's going on in Detroit then?   [Because in 36 games with Detroit this year, Svi Mykhailiuk had 0 dunks, but in 30 games with OKCthis year, he had 14](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mykhasv01.html)"
"Thomas Bryant, Isaac Bonga, Svi Mykhailiuk, and Moe Wagner have also been varying levels of good, especially considering their draft spots."
"Jaylen Hoard, Svi Mykhailiuk, Tony Bradley, and Mike Muscala are all players I’m preparing to leave the Thunder. There might be a couple trades involving moving Horford and/or possibly Vasilije Micic but I would want to keep him is given the choice."

"Warriors commentators are praising Svi Mykhailiuk, which at least gives me some idea of how tf to pronounce his surname"
"https://www.nbcsports.com/edge/basketball/nba/player-news/headlines/10105976  &gt;Lu Dort (The Al Horford Special, right hip, tank commander, Cade Cunningham) will not play on Monday vs. Philly.   &gt;Of course he won't. Dort has had a remarkable season and that's why the Thunder continue to hold him out of back-to-backs as they try to make up ground with fellow tankers Houston, Detroit, Minnesota and Orlando. This draft class is loaded with talent if you're wondering why tanking has gotten out of hand this season. Look for Svi Mykhailiuk, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams to soak up extra minutes. Dort will probably see time in three of OKC's five games this week."
Why stop there? We need to include Thomas Bryant and Mo Wagner. Is Isaac Bonga still around? How about Svi Mykhailiuk?

"That's not exactly what's happening but ok. They're still pretty bad they just drafted well and have dude playing for their NBA lives. Obv SGA is SGA but Poku and Maledon haven't even actually played a ton but have done well in limited minutes, and fucking Svi Mykhailiuk is their leading scorer...  I like the Thunder but they are definitely not almost done being bad unless they land a huge free agent or make a blockbuster trade."
Lakers fan thought Josh Hart gonna be the next Jimmy Butler and Svi Mykhailiuk gonna be the next Klay Thompson.. I’d like to see what delusional comparison you guys have in mind for THT
Svi Mykhailiuk could become a more athletic Klay Thompson

"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
"Potential Lineups:  Toronto – Fred VanVleet, Svi Mykhailiuk, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa  Boston – Dennis Schroder, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford  Not very promising for us"
"Luka’s contested rebound % is 23.9, right in between noted rebounding beasts George Hill and Svi Mykhailiuk  [From NBA stats](https://i.imgur.com/qCkI641.jpg)"
"In the 2018 Elite Eight Bagley got clamped up by Svi Mykhailiuk. Bagley is simply not very skilled, he was hyped up because of his athleticism and physical measurements.   His ceiling is a high energy rim running big probably on a second unit, but it’s only going to work on a team that already has a solid culture in place. Kind of like how the Knicks are using Obi"
"Other players that are close but under the minimum requirements:  Seth Curry 50.3%FG, 54.5%3P, 88.5%FT but currently under the required FTM.  Svi Mykhailiuk 50.8%FG, 40.0%3P, 89.5%FT but currently under the required FTM.  Let me know if there's others close on the required amount FGM, 3PM, FTM that I've missed."
"Yup you’re absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"

"The second story is of the time that a different teammate, Fred VanVleet, was really struggling at the rim. Fred just couldn't hit anything at all, and one day Svi came up to him and said he wanted to show Fred something in the video room. FVV was thrilled -- Svi is renowned for his basketball eye. For a long time, the Raptors thought Mykhailiuk would make a great scout after he retired (that plan is probably scuttled since Svi will clear $300 million in basketball after he plays out this contract). Anyway, VanVleet followed Svi into the room and got ready to receive some advice. On the television, cued up, was the behind the back crossover and drunk Svi hit against Indiana in his sixth big league exhibition. They watched it together. And then watched it again.   ""Do more of that,"" Svi said."
The Lakers and Trail Blazers wanted him but he chose the Raps because he likes Nick Nurse.   [Source](https://raptorsrapture.com/2021/10/02/toronto-raptors-svi-mykhailiuk-boldly-chose-raps-lakers/)

my search history  1. how tall is svi mykhailiuk  2. 2.01m to ft  and now im disappointed
It's a training camp battle between Sam Dekker and Svi Mykhailiuk on who gets the rights to be called the new Matt Thomas
Agent does more than just handle your one max contract though…and also Noel bottom of the FA barrel?! He most def was not back then. More just a mid FA not a Tyler Cook - Svi Mykhailiuk type
"6'7, can make an outside shot at about 35-38%, good enough to play decent bench minutes, but not starter quality, no particularly outstanding qualities, just pretty vanilla. Someone like a Svi Mykhailiuk"
you didn't have to insert yourself into this thread just to say you like Svi Mykhailiuk which has absolutely nothing to do with the topic...

Fuck Svi Mykhailiuk

"His skills make him a potentially really valuable player at the college level and a guy who's gonna get drafted. But he was getting hype as a generational player, and he measures as a less bouncy Svi Mykhailiuk. Guys like that don't tend to wind up on All NBA teams."
Don't forget to bring some of your best bench guys in *checks notes* Svi Mykhailiuk and khem birch? Ah rip
After losing Svi Mykhailiuk I would say that the Thunder’s championship window closed.
