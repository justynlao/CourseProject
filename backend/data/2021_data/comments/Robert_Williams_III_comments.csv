"That’s okay, Bontemps also had this to say about us in the same article.  &gt; Young center Robert Williams III is shooting 75% from the field, which also happens to be the same percentage of his 28 shots that have come at the rim. Rookie Payton Pritchard has proved his draft report to be correct as a quality long-range shooter, but his inexperience as a creator has led to him being used most frequently alongside Teague, playing off the ball."
"It's honestly infuriating to me.  He got us a chip in '08. We then stayed competitive for a few years after that, and when PP and KG began to decline, he traded them for an insane haul of picks.  The two main complaints our sub seems to have are:   1. He doesn't always draft well - this is a weird take given that he went against the grain to draft JB and JT, who are absolute fucking studs, and drafted core pieces like Smart (and recently PP and Robert Williams III).   2. He hasn't gotten the right pieces in trades/FA for a chip - also an ice cold take, given that we had a roster of Kyrie, JB, JT, Hayward, Horford as our starters, with Baynes, Rozier, Morris on the bench. That team was destined for greatness. That's a fucking slaughterhouse of a team, and Kyrie decided to disappear, Hayward was injured, and chemistry was god-awful.   So Ainge then goes ahead and fixes those issues by getting Kemba instead of Kyrie, and letting Morris and Rozier go.   And the team then loses in game 7 of the ECF - in a weird ass season, played in a neutral site, with Hayward and Kemba both not 100%.   He has done everything right in my book, or at least way more good than bad."

"I believe you're thinking of Robert Williams III because Grant is not any kind of ""lob threat""."
*immediately contacts Robert Williams III*
"You’re just going by PER then? So we can agree that Robert Williams III is a top 10 player? Thanasis Antetokounmpo has a higher PER than Blake Griffin this year, so we can agree that he’s the superior player right? Blindly comparing PER doesn’t mean a thing, it’s an incredibly situational stat.   To answer your questions...  1) Very questionable going forward. 2) The gap between the two on offense is pretty minor; the gap between the two on defense is **astronomical.** It’s also much harder to be one of the best defenders in the league and still produce the offense Jrue does - offense only players like Kemba are much more common and historically don’t end up as the last ones standing.  3) No, it doesn’t. Jrue is better in that role.  I’d argue you’re also forgetting about the major thing - Jrue has proven that he steps up to an elite level in the postseason. Kemba shrunk under the pressure. Playoff performance is what really matters for teams like Boston and Milwaukee, and it’s a huge difference in their resumes that you’re trying to conveniently ignore with your 3 questions."
"After 2017 Draft where Tatum was drafted     2018 - Robert Williams III (A developing young player capable of being a Starting Caliber Center in the league)   2019 - Romeo Langford (We just have to wait and see but he has potential), Grant Williams (I know some of you have given up on him but I still believe he is just given the wrong role and position. He was nice in the playoffs against the Heats last year and showed flashes that he can be a poor man's PJ Tucker (The Poorman's Draymond Green)   2020 - Payton Pritchard (Impact Role Player), Aaron Neismith (Still young but is already good defensively, a good college shooter and showed flashes of that in the NBA)      Now you can't expect young player to be as good as the top picks immediately. Brown didn't become who he is today from day 1. Rozier is not that good the first few years here in Boston. Case in point, you got to have patience and not jump to conclusions immediately regarding these young players."
The disrespect to Kemba Walker and Robert Williams III
"Robert Williams III was the 5th most efficient player in the East, does he take Julius’s spot on ALL NBA? Come on man… you are all about 1 thing."
Whatever it is Robert Williams III needs to be up there
"I would think the Celtics would have to offer Kemba plus extra assets.  Kemba, some picks, then maybe Nesmith?  But it would make sense for the Mavericks to insist on Robert Williams III or Smart along with Kemba.  So I don't know if a deal gets done.      And I'm not sure KP fits on the Celtics.  He's such an awkward player."
Robert Williams III from the MMXVIII draft also had IX blocks in a playoff game. Only one with more is the great number VI Bill Russell
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."

Robert Williams III
"Yeah I think it’s much easier to build around and win with Brown and Tatum than it is with Trae and Collins. With another true star besides Trae I’ll look at them in a different light.   And I don’t really know about The Celtics but them being frauds was never really something people said. We didn’t have Jaylen in the playoffs and he’s crucial to the teams success. Assuming that Brown is back next year and him and Tatum both take another leap I see the Celtics being an extremely talented team. Replacing Kemba with Horford is a great decision as well and the Celtics have the 5th youngest roster in the league. With more development to key players like Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams III, Grant Williams, and hopefully the addition of last year’s draft and stash Yam Madar the team should take a big step forward."
"A lot of things can factor into it. Luck with the draft and how your picks pan out being some of the main ones. The Cavs took Anthony Bennett #1 in the same draft where Giannis went #15.   There are always gonna be guys who don’t compare to their peers also. Look at the 2018 draft where you had Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr, Collin Sexton, and Mills Bridges go picks 6-10. You also have Shai, Michael Porter Jr, Robert Williams III, and Mitchell Robinson drafted after them. In hindsight, you would take all of those players in the top 10 (probably). You also need the players to be healthy and in an environment that encourages their development.   Take the kings for example. Luke Walton sets the development of his young players back because he has no clue what he is doing.   You need a competent coaching staff and front office if you are going to “complete” your rebuild"
Unbiased opinion. Ayton for now but Robert Williams III next year.

If you would like to say that Rob Will’s impact is overstated you need to back it up because every single impact statistic other than LEBRON (in which he’s still elite) have Robert Williams at an All-NBA level. So, where’s your argument?"

Robert Williams III will be on the team at that point
Robert Williams III = Timelord- that’s pretty sweet tbh
Robert Williams III and Lebron? Both potential GOATs
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Robert Williams III  Payton Pritchard  Aaron Nesmith   Romeo Langford  Grant Williams   Uhh Carsen Edwards / Bruno Fernando   Certainly gives the Hawks a run for their money
"Robert Williams III averaged 8 points and 7 rebounds last year in 53 games, got hurt, and signed a 4-year extension for $54 million dollars."

"&gt;Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks  &gt;It doesn't look like it will be a great season for the Celtics as they lost three of their best players last season and have a new head coach. The Knicks had a good preason and were able to keep their best players and probably should be the favorites here.  Wait, what? Yes, we lost meaningful players in the form of Fournier, Theis, and Kemba Walker every other game (or less), but we in no way lost three of our best players lol. We have legitimate depth now with Schroder, Horford and Richardson as well as recent draft picks really blossoming into good form (Robert Williams III, Nesmith, Langford, Pritchard). We have a whole new coaching style and locker room which can work with the players more than Brad could. I think the Celtics are legitimate underdogs but not looking at a bad season."

"Robert “Timelord” Williams III got an almost identical deal this year. Isaac and Fultz got similar-enough ones from the Magic alone last year, as did Kuzma, Kennard and OG. They’re just not as talked about because, well, they’re not max players."

"Morant is playing double the minutes Caruso is.  He's averaging almost quadruple the points, almost double the rebounds, and double the assists, with the same amount of steals.  Caruso's good on-ball defense and hustle is just not even close to enough to overcome that kind of difference.  It's like comparing Robert Williams III to Vucevic and saying defense closes that gap."
Robert Williams III has entered the chat. Robert Williams III has left the chat due to injury.
