Your list is missing Jalen Brunson
"Jalen Brunson, Jamychael Green"
Jalen Brunson
"&gt;	Im curious about the mavs guard situation. I thought Brunson was supposed to be the guy that gave Luka a break, but it seems like mavs fans are still desperate for that second ball handler. Whats going on with Terry? Does rhe offense just stop when Luka sits?  So brunson being that guy may have been the plan but the reality is that he just can’t run the offense well, imo. He seems to be a much better scorer than playmaker and trying to give him playmaking duties just isn’t going well. The reality is that Brunson actually plays much better *with* Luka, which is great, but in terms of getting Luka rest, it obviously isn’t ideal. The best secondary playmaker is JRich by a long shot and him working with Luka is ideal.  Carlisle usually goes with Jalen Brunson and Trey Burke when Luka is sitting, but both those guys face the same issue of being better scorers than passers. This lineup also runs with KP as the main offensive creator and Jesus Christ is that not doing so hot rn, so then it falls on Tim to hit shots and if they aren’t falling, offense stagnates. Not to mention with Burke and Brunson, defense takes a big hit. All of this culminates into a meh offense that gets lead disappearing quick until Luka and the starting unit come back and try to fix it.  As for Terry, are you talking about Tyrell Terry, our rookie? I personally wish he’d get minutes but Rick doesn’t really play rookies, especially now with a healthy lineup. It’s a shame because Terry has shown flashes, and his development will go a long way for us in the future."
Is jalen Brunson a rookie? His name doesn’t really sound that familiar to me
Pleasant: Jalen Brunson being back with 50/40/90 shooting splits  Unpleasant: James Johnson and Trey Burke playing 3rd and 4th most minutes because all of our starters got covid.
"THJ, James Johnson, Burke, Jalen Brunson. All have played that role this season or last; when you have that depth, you don't have to overplay your best player in the regular season (that doesn't help either)"
"Jalen Brunson-Rodman, where did that come from?"
"I know his bad percentages hurt the team, but we have no other options. We are last in 3 point percentage because everyone aside from Jalen Brunson and Trey Burke have regressed from last season. And usually The latter aren't out there when Luka is. It's demoralizing to drive and pass out to people knowing that it is gonna be a guaranteed brick, so I understand why he takes dumb shots sometimes. But still, he needs to be better at 3s if we want to win a playoff series."
"KP (#2 offensive weapon) was out with the meniscus recovery, Josh Richardson (3a offensive weapon) was out with covid, (Dwight Powell (the only backup center with any pick and roll ability) was out with covid, Dorian Finney Smith (2nd best defender who shot 37% on 3s last year) was out with Covid, and Maxi Kleber (best defender/shooter who is shooting over 47% on 3s this year at the Power Forward position) is out with Covid - all these players have been out at least 9 games. Jalen Brunson (backup point guard and is shooting almost 50/40/90 on 12ppg) was also out with covid protocol for like 5 games."
Jalen Brunson is a solid player and no im not saying this because im a Nova guy
"Luka was our leader in minutes played his rookie season. Jalen Brunson played 20-30 MPG his rookie year and averaged nearly 10PPG. Dennis Smith Jr. also played nearly 30 MPG his rookie season, even though he was very raw.  Rick has just never really had great rookies, outside of recently, and typically is not one to give unearned minutes."
i'd take jalen brunson over ben simmons  tbh
"Big difference between missing Seth Curry for 8 games, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott vs missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, and then have Tim Hardaway Jr play through injury."
"We are have been missing our 2nd-6th best players for almost half the season, as a result we've had to start 3rd stringers, rookies and G-league players, who are shooting at a historically low % from 3. Defenders do not respect our 3PT shooters so they clog the paint and leave guys like Wes Iwundu wide open for 3. (He's shooting 14% on the year). This means Luka isn't able to drive into the paint, and has to take mid range shots and 3s. His 3s are not good, but a lot of it stems from defenders not having to guard 3 of our starters (WCS, Iwundu and Green) and instead double or triple teaming Luka at all times.   The below players are our primary rotation guys from the past few weeks. Just absolutely awful.   WCS was let go from the Sacramento Kings, he's garbage. He is like 9/14 on dunks this season and a washed DeMarcus Cousins lit him up for 28/17/5. WCS is a -30 in his last 7 games.  Wes Iwundu is shooting 14.3% from 3 and 31.7% from the field. He is shooting 16.7% on wide open (nearest defender is 6+ feet away) 3 pointers. He's had one of the worst 3pt shooting seasons ever.  Josh Green is shooting 9% from 3. Green and Iwundu are posting 89 and 90 ORTG and 112 and 113 DRTG.  Boban is 7'4 and has not recorded a single block in 100 minutes of play. He is a nonexistent rim protector, cannot space the floor, cannot guard the perimeter and is slow. He's efficient in the low post and has good hands, that's about it.  THJ has been solid but wildly inconsistent. He's averaging 17.5 PPG on 38% from 3. His defense is below average, and he will have a 30 point game then proceed to shoot 0-12 and have 0 points like he did in Toronto. THJ has had 8 games shooting 38% or lower from the field (4 games of 0-30%), and then 4 games shooting 60-78% from the field.  Jalen Brunson has been great for us but he missed a lot of games. He's probably been our 2nd or 3rd best player as of late, despite only averaging 12 ppg and 3.5 apg.  Porziņģis missed 10 games so far, and is shaking off rust. He's averaging 19 ppg 47/29.5/82 shooting. His defense has been very poor and he's been a negative on court through 7 games.  James Johnson is nothing more than a back up big, he's shooting 3s at 31%, his defense is average and he makes some bad decisions.  That's our current rotation.  Luka, 1-3 average level starters (Porziņģis is a fringe all star usually, but has not been thus far in the season), and then a bunch of end of bench guys and rookies."
"2nd-6th best players (Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson &amp; Dwight Powell) have all missed nearly half the season. We've also had the 5th hardest SRS schedule thus far. As of now the remaining schedule is the 29th hardest."
monte morris and jalen brunson
Even if Dennis Smith Jr were still in Dallas Jalen Brunson would be playing his minutes.
Really great game by Jalen Brunson.
FUCK YES JALEN BRUNSON THOUGH I BITCH ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME
"This is a good take. There should be more optimism around Dallas for multiple reasons.   1. as you mentioned, point differential based models had the Mavs as one of the best teams in the west   2. Mavs struggled heavily in the clutch last year largely due to a very young and inexperienced core and also some bad luck. It’s worth noting that Luka was one of the best clutch performers in the league in his rookie year specifically when we had a bigger vet presence.   3. Mavs had quite an injury riddled season with Luka missing almost as many games as Kawhi, Dwight Powell going down with a torn Achilles and Jalen Brunson suffering a torn Labrum and of course KP tearing his meniscus in the playoffs"
You could switch Jalen Brunson and Fred V's jerseys and no one would notice
"We were missing THJ, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porziņģis is in his 3rd game back. That's 50+ FGA we were missing. Someone had to make up for them being gone. I'd rather have Luka shoot 30 FGA than Wes Iwundu or Tyrell Terry taking 15 FGA apiece."
OUT:  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Tim Hardaway Jr  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson
Luka and Jalen Brunson should be #9.
and Dorian Finney Smith. and Jalen Brunson
"That all they done in the past 5 year tho, that's not good. Passed up on so many guys who coulda been good bench pieces like Gary trent, jalen brunson etc and I'm missing a lot. Picking poole in the first ound encapsulates how bad FO been bc that man was projected second or even undrafted"
sixers would be better with jalen brunson or monte morris instead of ben
"Yes well when Jalen Brunson and the B team has a higher offensive rating than when Luka is on the floor, then the Mavs should definitely take the ball out of his hands and have them run the offense through Brunson for 48 minutes straight.   Great plan."
"Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divincenzo, Josh Hart, Eric Paschall."
"Jalen Brunson, KCP, Martin twins, Thomas Bryant"
"I think its just 2 starts (DFS, JRich) and Jalen Brunson (basically our 6th man, as of now anyway)"
"That's one of the issues in the current mavs roster. Our only reliable backup guard to run the point and playmake is jalen brunson, who is a massive liability and a very easy weak link on defense."
Jalen Brunson looks part Japanese
"&gt; He’s a one dimensional playmaker. A decent passer with little court vision.   That's good enough for a backup role. The number of backup PGs with excellent court vision can be counted on 1 hand  - Rondo, Lamelo (who will probably be starting by February), Rubio, maybe Monte Morris if you're being generous. It's not like Corey Joseph or Reggie Jackson or Jalen Brunson have great court vision."
"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."
"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."
"That’s how it is in most professions, sure.   But by that definition, you would say that Kostas Antetokounmpo has been in the league longer than Jalen Brunson?"
jalen brunson is frappuchino jj barea

Jalen Brunson hasn’t missed a shot yet
I remember a Mavs brought up how Jalen Brunson destroyed Luka’s Plus/Minus as a backup PG.
fyi this move is the Jalen Brunson Villanova special
"Jalen Brunson has all the signs of a breakout player about to tip over the edge. Last guy I was this confident about was Malik Beasley pre-Minnesota.  1. He's 24, but has come off the bench in a limited role his whole career so far not due to a lack of talent but because of a generational star at his position (Luka) and long time vets (JJ Barea). 2. When he has gotten the chance sans Luka he's had some stellar performances - massive sign when a player balls out when they get their shot - Wood, Sabonis, Beasley, Bam, Siakam all had this sign a fair while before people started to take notice. 3. Has become a very efficient player in his limited mins shooting 53/40/85, while averaging 13/3.5/3.5 in 25mpg. If he got more shots his efficiency would drop obviously - but he would still likely be above average for a PG. 4. Unrestricted FA the year after next, good chance he gets traded next year bc the Mavs are unlikely to pay him since he plays the same position as Luka  If he gets onto a team where he can play over 30mpg and be a full time PG I think he can easily put up anywhere from 18/5 to 22/7.  The Mavs are genuinely holding him back imo, not wrongly but nonetheless."
"Luka KP Jalen Brunson Tim Hardaway JR  Maxi Kleber Dorian Finny Smith Willie Cauley Stein Trey Burke  Tough leaving Boban off the list, but these are definitely the 8 most important Mavs. Not sure anyone from our team would be taken tbh. Richardson, James Johnson, Powell, and Iwundu have been underwhelming and we haven't seen much of anything from our rookies yet"
As a Jalen Brunson day 1 I feel vindicated
"Scorching hot take, but someone has to be the sacrifice and say it first, so that others find the courage to follow:  I think Jalen Brunson is a real NBA player!"
Jalen Brunson: No Luka? No Problem 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
"I feel like we keep getting hit by huge games from role players. Gallo dropped 38 on us a few days ago, Jalen Brunson had a big night, the Pistons slaughtered us with Delon Wright and Saddiq Bey a while back. Anyone else feel like this has been happening a lot?"
"Jalen Brunson agrees with you, as he basically said the same thing... 🤣"
"Rumor is that Seth Curry was traded after a prank he tried to pull on Jalen Brunson went horribly wrong. Seth hid in his locker in order to scare him, but Jalen didn’t show up to practice that day. Seth accidentally locked himself in the locker and couldn’t get out for quite some time. Unfortunately he doesn’t have the iron bladder most Curry men are famous for, and he ended up peeing all over Jalen’s things."
"Overrated: Not sure, Josh Richardson maybe  Underrated: Jalen Brunson"
Jalen Brunson had this called as an offensive foul the night before... something about superstar treatment
"Jalen Brunson was called for an offensive foul against kemba during the last minute of the mavericks celtics game for doing this and immediately called for an offensive foul on the floor, no need for a replay. Booker clearly initiates the contact  I've noticed this happen more this season idk its just not good basketball"
Now we just gotta get a 3 team trade with Suns and mavs going for Jalen Smith and Jalen Brunson.
"Harden is passing to Joe 50% 3-pt shooter Harris and Kyrie Irving - who are Luka, Trae, and Steph passing to? Luka is passing to Tim Hardaway/Jalen Brunson, Trae is passing to John Collins/Capela, and Steph is passing to Oubre/Wiggins - all substantially worse than Joe Harris and Kyrie Irving, which thus makes it harder to create assists."
"Jalen Brunson did this same exact thing last night in our game against the Celtics and it was correctly called an offensive foul, don’t know why this one wasn’t.   No consistency whatsoever. Luka gets away with it also"
Not making the team but Jalen Brunson is a lefty who has been good this year
Jalen ‘Khris Middleton’  Brunson.
"Jalen, mother fucking, Brunson. Dude consistently plays his heart out and is a huge contributor to our wins. Luka is Luka, he's gonna do Luka things, but Jalen has been extremely instrumental in the teams success."
all star snub jalen brunson was also huge
We all know luka is a god but can we talk about how Jalen Brunson has consistently gotten better each year. Dude always plays his heart out and is so good both with and without Luka on the court.
"Luka was clutch as hell tonight and the celtics duo made him really work for his points, probably the best he has been defended ever.  But lets give a shout to the 4rth quarter king jalen brunson. What a fucking season he is having."
Jalen Brunson biggest all star snub? People are saying this
"Lol, wasn't Bill Simmons clowning on the mavs the other day for the fact that ""jalen brunson seems really important"" to our team? Well, lots of high fives after that 4th quarter"
Yogi Ferrel walked so Jalen Brunson could run
jalen brunson is the best jb on the court
Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson &gt; KP
"I was discussing this trade possibility yesterday: Wiggins+manion+ wolves pick for KP+Jalen Brunson+multiple picks.   It could work in theory, but unlikely to happen"
"Man I would love to be in the Celtics shoes. They have arguably have 2 of top 5-10 players that under 24 still on amazing contracts. They still have all of their draft picks, and have great players on rookie contracts. On top of that they have a trade exception which they could get a few nice pieces from it. Jalen Brunson is one of the last people I want to trade from the Mavs, but I feel like he would be an affordable piece for the Celtics that could help with their guards."
Beal is a really good player but those players really valuable for Mavs.  Jalen Brunson is one of the best backup PGs in the league. Dorian Finney Smith is really good 3D guy and ofc Tingus Pingus. I know his health is a problem but have you ever seen Bubble Zinger or his Knicks Era? Plus three first round picks is kinda too much. Both Brunson and DFS plays for very little money btw.
"Probably preferred DSJ  At that moment in their careers, Jalen Brunson was averaging 6.5 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists on 43-34-69 shooting   DSJ his rookie year averaged 15 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists on 40-31-69 shooting  slightly less efficient but on way more volume and physical tools that looked like they might have a much higher upside. Also worth noting that those were DSJ's stats on a team that was pretty much intentionally trying to lose."
"&gt;Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary. Now in our 5th Season.  Did the Mavs win? ✅ things gotta little too close  for comfort there at the end.   Damn we needed this win with the two games we got postponed and Boston, Brooklyn, and Philly this week ☘️🗑️🔔  Luka started off slow tonight with only 2pts in the 1st quarter but managed to finish with 21/7/5/2 on solid shooting albeit with an abysmal night from the FT line with 2/9. Hopefully he goes back to hitting those freebies cuz we'll need with this rough week we got. 👍🇸🇮🎗️🧱  Hope Maxi's ankle's ok after that little roll there towards the end 🇩🇪🦶🏥  Hopefully KP plays tomorrow after being DNP'd tonight. 🤞🦄🇱🇻  JRich had a great start tonight with a quick 11pts in the 1st and finished with nice 17/7/3/2 with 3 3's 👌💦  Bench Analysis 💺 ⤵️  Timmy continues his 6th Man tenure with another great shooting night knocking down 7 3's to finish with 29pts to lead the team in scoring 💺6️⃣🔥👌💦  Brunson Burner with 19/7/3 on good shooting to combine with Timmy for the Bench production tonight. ♨️👍💺  Overall a much needed win with the 3 tough games we got this week to help us claw back up in the standings. Hopefully KP plays tomorrow and we get this kinda night from Timmy, JRich, and Jalen as well to hopefully finish the 1st half of the season on a good note. We got a 2nd night of a back to back against Boston tomorrow ☘️"
"Luka aside, Jalen Brunson is our best draft pick in a looong time. The bar is very low but Brunson hurdles it easily"
maybe a mild take but jalen brunson is better than ja morant at the moment
wow i always knew that Jalen Brunson didn’t care smh smh
"Their next 5 after Luka in minutes played are in order: Tom Hardaway, Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jalen Brunson, and Kristaps Porzingis.  Is that really so bad?"
"They can develop it but it’s increasingly less useful as the NBA moves to other types of shots, especially for guys who aren’t bigs. Jalen Brunson (he’s not as small but still) had a great post game at Villanova and doesn’t really use it as much in the NBA."
Jalen Brunson isn't a PG?   BBRef lists LeBron as PG. Then why is he a frontcourt player by All Star game division?
Jalen Brunson is another one for sure. And one of a few bright spots during Dallas' struggles.  11.7 ppg  3.6 apg  3.2 rpg  51/38/89 shooting splits coming primarily off the bench this year in 24 mpg.
"Lmao I was just joking, the draft really is deep as hell. Didnt mean to try and undermine your opinion. Like shake milton, mitchell robinson, hamidou diallo, jalen brunson and devonte graham all drafted in the second round is a great pool of talent to choose from. Could be they are in situations good for them, but the skill and potential between all of them is amazing."
Might as well just throw Jalen Brunson into the starting  lineup
"Yeah, that's why I said when Porzingus gets out of his rut, which will happen in the future, these posts will look awfully silly.   As in, we can come back to this post and say, ""man, how ridiculous were we when we actually thought THJ and Jalen Brunson were better than Porzingus"".  Then we'll all have a good laugh."
Jalen Brunson
Luka Doncic Jalen Brunson and a first is enough right?
why did we leave in jalen brunson and make him run suicides instead of having our top if not best wing defender josh richardson in the last part of the 4th quarter
"Jalen Brunson, said he ""looked like a midget"" compared to everyone else on the floor"
"I also think that Fultz deal is absolutely moronic. He isn't an elite defender, his three ball is still an abomination, and he's just *pretty good* as a lead guard. Like, where does he rank on your list of one guards? Will he ever be a top-20 starting PG? I don't think so. He might not even really be a top-30 PG. Like, you could talk me into DiVincenzo or Jalen Brunson or DeAnthony Melton being better.  I mean, Lonzo seems better than Fultz, but *still* isn't clearly an above average lead guard."
"Perhaps I don’t hear about the no flopping warnings, but players do worse than this almost every game. There was hip contact and his foot was stepped on by Brooks. While it certainly was not enough to call a foul and I don’t like seeing anyone embellish like Kuz did, I ROUTINELY see players like Dame, Harden, and others come around screens and flop against the screen of their own fucking teammate to try and draw a foul on the trailing defender. Harden consistently throws his head back and flails his arms when he drives even when there is no contact.   I saw Jalen Brunson pump fake a defender and then shoot the ball from the RIGHT side of his body to draw a foul (he’s left handed). Players often fall to the ground to try and draw a foul on jumpers, pretending that their landing zone was impeded even when there is no contact. Embiid usually has 2-3 flops of this caliber every game...  Long story short, I would love for them to actually start punishing people for flopping, but am confused as to why they doled out a warning here and ignored everything else I just mentioned. Lebron’s warning was more than justified."
&gt;Dallas Mavericks- Luka Doncic- if he can win a championship or two and multiple MVPs than I think he can overtake Dirk  If Jalen Brunson doesn't beat him to it!
Jalen Brunson!
Jalen Brunson for sure
Jalen Brunson- most comfortable with the ball in his hands if it isn't Luka.
"i've said it before and i'll say it again, it's jalen brunson"
"Dallas:   * Missing 5 of our 8 best players for 10+ games with COVID (Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson and Dwight Powell), they've been slow to get back to form. * Missed our 2nd best player for the first 10 games due to surgery. Porziņģis has also been slow to shake off rust but is getting there.  * Most difficult strength of schedule to start the season (first 20-25 games I believe)"
"lmao they aren't even considering Portland who is down 2 starters, or Dallas (who OP even failed to mention) who was missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith for 10+ games. That's 6 of our top 8 guys, plus we had the most difficult schedule for our first 25 games."
"in a 3 way trade, bulls get jalen brunson, mavs get aaron gordon, and the magic get shafted"
"This list is garbage. Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jalen Brunson are the best duo in the league!  All kidding aside, CJ and Dame are way too low on this list I think."
Jalen Brunson is a top 3-4 important player on y’all’s team. Such a good teammate and just a smart basketball player. He is a winner.
"Trae was mic’ed up this game. Think the NBA Will publish what he Said to the ref after the last play? On a sidenote, props to THJ and Jalen Brunson for turning the game around when Luka didn’t have the best of offensive game in the Second half"
"A guy who has 11 inches and 70lbs on him didn't see the screen and ran directly into his chest. Falling over was def the right move.. If you try to stand your ground against that you're setting the worst screen of all time. You will have to backpedal to keep your balance and probably get called for a moving screen... and if you aren't, then it will be a completely ineffective screen. Trae also took an inadvertent forearm to the nose as he was going down.  I'm not surprised nothing was called as it was off ball on the final play and trae didn't go flying or anything.  The lob to Collins was there. Knew he would get a 1-on-1 in the post. Heurter should've hit him. That's such a brutal loss though. Dallas shot 15/21 in the quarter. Jalen Brunson and THJ don't miss.  It really feels like trae is just cursed against the mavs. Plays an amazing game. Mavs threw absolutely everything at him and he was dicing them apart all game long. 15 assists, 3 turnovers. Every time he got doubled he made them pay. And the story is gonna still be luka better and trae flopper."
Jalen Brunson looks so good offensively in these games. He could be a good starting PG on some teams.
Can’t wait to see all the fans on our sub post Jalen Brunson trade proposal instead of appreciating his development.  He’s basically a 50/40/90 (89.6% FTs) guy and is becoming one of the best back up PGs in the league.
"Jalen Brunson and Tim Hardaway Jr saved that game for us, Luka and WCS both played great too."
Lets give some love to Jalen Brunson who stepped up that 4th quarter. Finished 21pts 4rebs and 5 asts.
Jalen Brunson is a starting PG in the league
"Third best, have you seen Jalen Brunson?"
After Jalen Brunson obviously
"Jalen ""Michael Jordan"" Brunson."
Jalen Brunson.
"Jalen Brunson is a legitimately good fucking player. I truly think he can be a starter on a championship contender. This healthy team is looking up, love it!"
Jalen Brunson &gt; Trae Young   dont @ me
Man Jalen Brunson is so good.
Jalen Brunson is better than both COMBINED
Jalen Brunson exists.     maybe don't trade Seth Curry???   let Josh Richardson touch the ball sometimes????   and Trey Burke can't even get touches off the bench.
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."
Young Players: Tyrell Terry like what?  You mean Jalen Brunson?
sixers would be better with jalen brunson instead of ben simmons
"you in 6 months ""are we really going to ignore that jalen brunson had the biggest anomaly in playoff history?"""

"74.9% at the rim -- [basketball reference link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doncilu01/shooting/2020)  He's dropped off by 5%pts to 70%, but now our 6'1"" [Jalen Brunson is finishing at 80%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brunsja01/shooting/2021). Low volume but - now that's insane."
Give me Jalen Brunson anyday of the week
"Nova products have been great lately. Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Eric Paschall, Donte Divencenzo, Josh Hart, Omare Spellman’s played some fair minutes, Saddiq Bey, Arcidiacano’s in the Bulls rotation.   All players from 2016-2020"
Jalen Brunson is playing himself into starting pg value and I don’t like it one bit.
"uhh kleber, THJ and Trey Burke were all good 3 point shooters before luka graced them with his magical presence.   jalen brunson was drafted with luka like what"
"The correct answer is Mike Conley.   Jalen Brunson is up there, too."
Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson.
Jalen Brunson over Graham.
I think far better is a stretch. Brandon Ingram and Lonzo would be above KP and Jalen Brunson in most peoples eyes
One word  Jalen Brunson
"I honestly cannot believe that the trade value wasn’t that high. Like, the Mavs could’ve traded a first round pick and Jalen Brunson, James Johnson and Dwight Powell,"
"He is definitely good enough, but that style of player usually doesn't win.  Almost always it's the primary shot creator on the perimeter.  A guy like jj wouldn't get enough touches in that environment.  A do everything guy like Jalen Brunson is the type of guy that would win euroleague mvp. He can shoot a bit , score inside, pass."
Jalen Brunson is a STUD
This is hella disrespectful to Jalen Brunson &amp; Tim Hardaway Jr &amp; Morris is very good.
"Just gonna copy and paste my answer to the same question last month lol:   Not a mavs fan, but im a firm firm believer that the mavs' roster is just like last year's lakers but worse: all nba wing that plays the main playmaker + offensively gifted big that likes jumpshots + lots of back up big men (dwight powell is abnormally horrendous tho) + scoring shooting guards.  Using my Laker observation skills, the mavs need another playmaker bc luka cant be the only dude running things decisively on offense (jalen brunson is no dennis schroeder or rondo). And the mavs just need to get better at defense + rebounding. Like these mf's have the same-ish tools as the championship lakers, all they need is a scheme to get their plethora of bigs clogging the paint and their wings/guards running n causing a frenzy so it goes back to offense and into luka's hands as soon as possible.   Carlisle's offense has always been a majestic thing but if ur not the nets then dont try to win games/chips solely by outscoring opponents with high pnr's"
"Jalen Brunson is easily their 2nd playmaker, but having Dorian Finney do this every night is the challenge. expecting them to throw some money at Oubre next year"
Jalen Brunson flopped. Quote that as well
"Jalen ""Mean Mug"" Brunson"
Jalen brunson
Jalen Brunson is a fearless baller
yall why cant jalen brunson be fred vanvleet? is it crazy to think that's an in-play outcome for him?
Jalen Brunson flopping now
Jalen Brunson hands down. He’s won so many games for us.
I’d agree with this. Jalen Brunson been making a strong push lately.
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
"&gt;What?  The Lakers win a ring every 4 years, on average, and Towns would've been a Laker for 5 by now.  Their rate is much higher when they have a top center, as well, somewhere around 50%, actually.  So he'd certainly have one, and quite likely more.  Towns has been an extremely good player from his 2nd season on, and if you think about their roster moves over the past 6 years, it's obvious they'd have been very competitive with Towns.    Had they drafted Towns instead of Russell, in 2017 they'd have had Towns, Randle, Ingram, Nance up front and even though young, that's as-good as anyone's frontcourt. They'd have never signed Mozgov -- almost certainly a guard, instead.  Maybe they still draft Zubac in the second round to backup Towns -- which is by-far the best center tandem in the league in short order -- or they flip him for a guard, because they wouldn't need or want Muscala.  They don't sign Andrew Bogut's corpse, either.  They probably don't dump Jordan Clarkson and Nance to clear that second max free agent spot, since they wouldn't need to.  They don't waste a 2019 second trading for Roy Hibbert, either.  They don't trade for Thomas Bryant, either.  There's not any telling who'd they'd draft after that point, but that front office did not really miss on draft picks, so they would likely be good.  They probably don't trade for Kuzma, but don't really need him anyway with the aforementioned forwards.  They almost certainly don't spend two more late-first round picks on centers in Moe Wagner, and Tony Bradley if they have Towns -- probably get guys like Derrick White, or Jalen Brunson instead.  They also don't fire Byron Scott in 2016, who was a very good coach.  The Lakers have wasted a ton of assets since 2015 in searching for a quality big man, and then blew an unprecedented package of assets to rent one last season.  With Towns, none of that would've been necessary, and they'd have been a far more attractive free-agent destination to boot.  There is basically no time in NBA history where the Lakers had a top 5 center and didn't at least make the Finals more often than not -- and the Lakers have had a top 5 center for about 30 seasons."
"Jamal Tinsley, Yogi Ferrell, Jalen Brunson, all those guys. He's a true PG whisperer"
"&gt; I don't expect him to win but I'll be shocked if he doesn't get significant votes this year.  You might be shocked. He's having a nice season but there are several others having a better or equal shot at it than him. Barring injury, Clarkson is most likely winning it. Other strong candidates are Harrell, Boucher, Ingles, and maybe biased but Tim Hardaway Jr and Jalen Brunson should get some votes."
Jalen Brunson was even better than him almost immediately
  Jalen Brunson .
"brunson is a legit integral part of this squad &amp; the box almost never gives the true story. he is a fucking winner, like essentially. he seems virtually unaffected by the crunch. he isn’t perhaps the flashiest player but he can get to the cup and finish. He shoots decent threes. He makes plays. Some folks itt comparing him to barea+ and for sure jalen gives a spark coming in and makes plays. He can command a game like jj would despite being the smallest guy on the court. and at the end of the day, he fits the squad and he gets us Ws. i hope he’s around for for a while but i could see him playing his way to a bigger spotlight someplace else if that’s what he wants in the future."
Jalen MF Brunson
"&gt;Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary.   Did the Mavs win? ✅  Luka had a rough night from 3 and the FT line, but was solid from everywhere else on the floor with 26/8/6 on 50% overall shooting. 👍🇸🇮🎗️  Boban started tonight with KP out and had a 15/12 double. Missed a few point blank layups and a 3 but overall did ok in KP's absence. 🇷🇸👍  Dorian with 11/4 off of 3 3's 👌💦  Melli started in Maxi's absence and had a perfect shooting game with 10/8/3 💯👍🇮🇹🍝  Bench Analysis 💺⤵️  Brunson Burner led the bench in scoring tonight with 19pts with 2 Steals ♨️💺  Timmy  with 16pts making 3 3's to follow Jalen in Bench Scoring 💺👌💦  Our rookie, Green got about 20min of  playing time tonight with 4/7 and 2 Steals, which hopefully means he's slowly gaining Rick's trust 🇦🇺🦘♜"
"I have some redd foxx Jalen Brunson posts on my profile, the resemblance is uncanny"
Jalen Nikola Jokic Brunson
Jalen “Doyle” Brunson with those deadly 2’s
"Knicks offense was absolutely abysmal last night (more than usual) but I can't be mad at the defense they played at all. Kept Porzingis to 6/17FG and 1/7 from three. Doncic was 8/19 up until the fourth and had 5 turnovers.  It was THJ and Jalen Brunson who were the biggest threats last night, Knicks couldn't seem to stop Brunson from getting in the paint. Think dude finished a +35."
"I'm going to take this moment to point out that Jalen Brunson, a 6'1"" guard, is shooting over 80% in the restricted area."
Lots of great players come off the bench. I think both Jalen Brunson and Tim Hardaway Jr. for example are better players than Oubre.
Second day in a row where I comment Jalen Brunson
as i've been saying for 3 years now  jalen brunson
JALEN BRUNSON IS A GOD
Jalen Brunson is so good man.
Luka  KP  Tim Hardaway JR  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Willey Cauley Stein  Trey Burke
Is this deserved or most likely to win? I think THJ or Jalen Brunson could get into the back end of the conversation for Dallas
Justise Winslow &amp; Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson????
I fucking love Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson is one of the best finishers in NBA history and Im not joking in the slightest
"This is a bad post, and you didn't even mention Jalen Brunson. Underrated guy."
"This off-season the timberwolves should offer the Mavs Malik Beasley for Maxi Kleber and something - Dorian Finney-Smith and a 1st, Jalen Brunson and a highly protected 1st, etc. Mavs get a scoring guard, which they need, and the wolves get a defensive PF, which they desperately need."
"Pretty much. Yet another reason we need to get him someone else that can help lower the burden for him offensively. No one else on our team aside from Jalen Brunson is a ball handler that can create their own shots, and Brunson is his backup lol."
6’7 Jalen Brunson
The daily life of having Josh Richardson or Jalen Brunson as your secondary playmaker
Guys he’s lying. Jalen Brunson sucks. You do not want to throw money at him in free agency. Just avoid him at all costs
Jalen Brunson
"Australian watching through the NBA app through the first time, does this Jalen Brunson ad play often"
Idk maybe Jalen Brunson
Right now its jalen brunson. Eventually it will be either kpj or IQ
Jalen Brunson.
Jalen Brunson is the highest rated PG. Steal.
jalen brunson better than trae young
Jalen Brunson
"Everyone is talking about the shot, but the way he moves caught my eye as well. He has quick, light feet. Such a fluid athlete. He was able to shadow Jalen Brunson, who’s an entire foot shorter than he is. If he can pack on some weight, he will truly be able to guard all five positions in the modern NBA."
"Better than Élie Okobo, Jevon Carter or Jalen Brunson?"
Jalen Brunson.
Jalen Brunson is 53.4/40.4/84.4 with 61.1 in 2pt attempts
"Lonzo is clearly an extraterrestrial who escaped Area 51 to crash land on earth and steal the rookie scoring title.  Now, to be fair, Young has taken a couple bad shots that have missed the rim. But for the most part he's been virtually unstoppable this season, and has the third highest field goal percentage in the country at 48.5% behind only Jalen Brunson and Trae. They also haven't won a game since they lost Chris Paul and made Blake Griffin the sacrificial lamb."
"Pretty much any of the Spurs guards, a few of the Dallas players like Jalen Brunson, Tim Hardaway Jr, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell  They seem great and they’ve impressed when I’ve seen them but no idea how consistent they are or how the factor into the teams plans and futures or how good they are really"
"Put Gobert on the Mavericks and they’re the best team in the west easy.  On an unrelated note, could I interest you in Dwight Powell and Jalen Brunson?"
"I mean, yeah, but there's a reason the Spurs beat the Heat and it's because of a lot of guys making more winning plays than the other team. that's why guys like Jalen Brunson go in the second round but become extremely useful role players, while uber athletes wash out of the league.   Jimmy Butler should not be better than Paul George, statistically and especially as a scorer. they're similar defenders and PG is usually a more efficient scorer but is there anybody who would rather have him over Butler right now? it's because Jimmy makes ""winning plays"" when it matters and PG doinks shots off the backboard. maybe I spent too much time watching the big three all succeed long past their primes because of ""winning plays"" and I'm just ignorant to how basketball works."
"Paul George, Kyrie, jalen Brunson"
I'll say Jalen Brunson. Him or Gallinari.
Tim Hardaway junior or Jalen brunson are also solid picks.

Jalen Brunson my friend. With Zach Lowe. It’s where the 6’5 250 lbs joke comes from.
"Luka and Timmy have been the most consistent guys on our team, but every other guy had a stretch of 2-3 weeks where he was a major contributor for winning.  Jalen Brunson in February was great, KP was great from February-March, Kleber was shooting extremly well for the first 3 months of the season.  Burke contributed to winning during the Covid crisis and is playing well since he got the chance against GSW.  For the last 15 games, DFS is probably the hottest and best 3&amp;D guy in the league, Powell is back to his old version and even WCS can give you 2 good games every week.  Shotout to the rookie Green, who was the reason for our comeback against Miami and lately has been our best defender coming from the bench."

Jalen Brunson built for this moment
Yea Jalen Brunson always looks like a midget on the court but he's got like five inches on me lol.
"There isn't really a way to define point guard that fits all intuitions. Point guards are (often) a function of their role (bringing the ball up, guarding the guy who brings the ball up) but also their relation to the other guys (usually they are smaller than the other guys, or at least not the biggest guy). But lots of guys listed as point guard won't bring the ball up, such as when jalen Brunson is on the court with luka. Giannis was obstensably listed as a point guard for a while. Magic is often seen as a point guard in GOAT discussions, but his role is very similar to LeBron, who is almost always seen as a forward.   I guess my point is that there isn't an intuitive definition that fits all cases well, because basketball is fluid and concepts mark borders that aren't fluid. So if they want to put jokic as a point guard or Embiid as a forward I don't think it is absolutely crazy, it is just taking a very offensive function heavy definition."
"Basically look at Dwight Powell's 25-pt, 11/12 FGs game last month, then make it happen more often throughout the season. It would also add another playmaker option, so not having Luka on the floor doesn't mean you're just left with Jalen Brunson.  Can't have the same roster though as the pick used for Josh Green MUST convey to ATL instead."
DFS and Jalen Brunson on the mavs. Lu Dort. Robert Covington before his extension.
Jalen Brunson?
Jalen Brunson
"Jalen Brunson is their 2nd ball handler. He’s really nice at getting to the basket and shooting the midrange.   Usually when teams get too double heavy on them, Brunson comes in with Luka and it’s worked really well."
"Right because exactly the 31st pick is what i’m talking about. Just look at the 2018 draft, far back enough to evaluate whether these players are good and still relatively recent. In the 31-40 range, good young players like Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson were taken and rotation players like Bonga and Carter"
5th seed rolled out a team with Jalen Brunson as its second best player. Let that sink in before people start calling the Mavs a talented team. And keep that in mind when evaluating who really is having a MVP season
"Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, Tim Hardaway Jr, Jalen Brunson, KP are not trash lol"
"Ah yes, almost forgot about Jalen Brunson"
[Redd Foxx looks like old Jalen Brunson](https://i.imgur.com/oEOGDna.jpg)

He needs help. KP plays 50% of games and can't create anything on offense except for himself and they have no other consistent playmakers other than Jalen Brunson kind of. Best case scenario is y'all can flip KP for a consistent scorer/playmaker

"As a Mavs fan, I want to put forward Dorian Finney-Smith as the most underrated by counting stats. He constantly picks up the toughest defensive assignments leaving it all out there on the court, whilst also being a good 3pt shooter. On top of all that, lately he has been showing more aggression driving to the rim. All that whilst being on a steal of a contract.   Kleber is a good shout, however he has been struggling with finding his rhythm lately after returning from injury, so his production has dropped off a bit. An honorable mention on the Mavs is Jalen Brunson, who is one of, if not, the best backup-PG in the league. He is a really efficient scorer and especially good finisher at the rim considering his size. He also has a good midrange and 3pt shot whilst being a decent playmaker."
Jalen Brunson has been arguably the second best player on the Mavericks and can't even get a mention smh
"If Luka turns into prime Magic, Porzingis turns into prime Dirk, Jalen Brunson turns into prime Harden, THJ turns into prime Reggie Miller, DFS turns into prime Shawn Marion, and Dwight Powell continues to play like prime Wilt Chamberlain, the Mavs might have a dynasty"
Jalen Brunson
"Monte Morris, Jalen Brunson, Tyus Jones or De'Anthony Melton  George Hill still has a good case even at his age."
Jalen Brunson?
Jalen Brunson and DFS.
Jalen Brunson dropping 50
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5.

"Mitchell Robinson is getting drafted after Miles Bridges, Duncan Robinson, Jalen Brunson, 100% of the time  edit: also Devonte Graham is going after the 3 guys i mentioned imo"
"I think Jalen Brunson has good of a case, if not better, than TJ. But the narrative won’t help either one. It’s almost guaranteed to go to one of the two Jazz players (having the best record also helps). TJ has been great though. If you are an undrafted player that isn’t necessarily the most athletic, he (along with with FVV) can definitely help you with inspiration."
"Guy is a beast. Was one of my favourite college players throughout his Villanova stint and I honestly think he should have been drafted higher. Undersized scrappy points guard like Jalen Brunson and Payton Pritchard stay being underrated, despite the age"
Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson
He can’t play defense and that comparison made me chuckle. Jalen Brunson can bring anything Kemba does to the Mavs
"I thought for sure we were in for more disappointment after giving up 36pts in the first quarter. Credit the zone defense and Jalen Brunson for flipping the narrative in the second. JB is so good man, I really hope we hang on to him."
Jalen Brunson may be the best backup PG in the league
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
also Jalen Brunson
"I really like Jalen Brunson. He’s a UFA too, no need to worry about Dallas matching an offer."
We need him more. We can spare jalen Brunson
"Mavs knew this since they saw how well Jalen Brunson was playing, but they still passed on Bey with the  18th pick :/"
"Lol let’s look kristap porzingis season stats  20 points a game with 10 rebounds per game.   Dude is averaging 20/10 that seems pretty good to me even with his bad play earlier in the season, meaning that recently he’s been balling out.  Jalen Brunson 13 ppg I wish Trae had a backup PG averaging that and not Rondo with 4 ppg. We’ll see about playoff Lou"
"Jalen brunson is legit 6MOY, kleber is one of the highest percentage 3P shooters in the league (albeit on lower volume), JRich is a solid defender and often gets hot on the other end, DFS is an above average role player on both ends. I think it's a pretty solid team"
Yeah you're right this was in no way Jalen Brunson fault for being bad at defense and not scoring any points. He played 17 minutes and had a -20 on his plus-minus  I watched Julius Randle put damn near every single Maverick on the court on his hip and then score so I don't think this was in particular kp's fault
"any1 Ever call Jalen, Brunson Burner haha"
"I think some Mavs fans had noted the Knicks could be the main threat to lure Brunson away. Jalen's dad is also a former assistant under Thibs, New York is closer to home for the Brunson family, etc.   That said, I think the Mavs value him really highly and will be aggressive to keep him. They labeled him untouchable with Luka and KP and won't have any incentive to sell out knowing they'll be operating above the cap anyway. The team also extensively relies on Jalen as a secondary playmaker."
"It may be controversial but Jalen Brunson is a better player than Lonzo.  You can say Lonzo is  much better defender but Jalen is closing out games for us, single-handedly won us a couple of games in the 4th, 2nd best Mavs player in the clutch after Luka and crazy efficiency and consistency from the bench."
Knicks going to max Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson better
Jalen Brunson absolutely explodes all over Lukas face!
I mean we have a pretty good bench with two potential 6th man candidates in THJ and Jalen Brunson.
LeBron in 2007 would have killed someone to have Jalen Brunson
"Swear I've never seen Jalen Brunson miss in the midrange. Don't bring me stats, he's 100% from there and I know it"
jalen brunson looked like steve nash on that possession
"Jalen Brunson. He's finally getting some attention for his play this season, but he's been under the radar. Excellent backup point guard for Dallas that could be a starter for some teams. Rick Carlisle plays him in the closing unit next to Luka because Brunson is one of the Mavs' best players, and probably the best on-ball creator on the perimeter after Luka."
There is a number of guys on rookie deals. Jalen Brunson is on a similar deal to Dort and is in the 6th man of year conversation.
Jalen Brunson had a very good finishing season for his size.
Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson
"On the Mavs, Jalen Brunson and Maxi Kleber.    They seem really nice, intelligent and funny.   Good role players too."
too early to tell but Jalen Brunson is finishing pretty well near the rim this season
I know this player is random but Jalen Brunson i just lobe the way he plays the game a mid range deadeye who can take it to the rim he finished top 5 in FG% in the paint and he is only 6'0    All time has to be joe johnson
"Relegate to catch and shooting? Did you want Luka to put the ball in Josh Richardson's hands - the same Josh Richardson who had more turnovers than assists? Or what about noted turnover machine Dorian Finney Smith, who can barely dribble at an NBA level? Or maybe he should've let one of our 6 bigs handle the ball and playmake? Or what about Timmy, the guy who will either only shoot or drive for a layup? Maybe Jalen Brunson, who was shut down in the playoffs? That just leaves noted DNP Trey Burke and rookie Josh Green as the last 2 players in our regular season rotation - should we rely on them? LeBron in 2018 was incredible but to say that he could get this team to be more than spot up shooters is asking for a miracle."
Jalen Brunson could definitely be that for the Mavs
"It's weird because during the series it seemed that Luka definitely dominated, but he also was kicking out to everyone as well...except Porzingis.     We were seeing kickouts to Jalen Brunson, THJ, Dorian Finney Smith, and even Boban.  It felt like the only time KP got the ball was when the ball would occasionally swing around from and then would reach him from someone who wasn't Luka.  Something is wrong here and I hope the team can address it."
The difference between a role player and star is consistency  Jalen Brunson is a good role player Imo
"THJ shot 24% from 3 on 9 attempts a game in the closing 4 games, Jalen Brunson shot 33%, KP shot 21%. Luka shot 36% from 3 in the last 4 games and was the second highest on the team. I know THJ is known for his inconsistency but that’s exactly it. Shooting 27% from 3 as a team over a 4 game stretch (excluding Luka) is a terrible look"
I mean Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jalen Brunson are capable offensive scorers and to a lesser extent playmakers
"Who on the Mavs can create their own shot? I count 0 outside of Luka. Maybe Jalen Brunson.  Who on the Mavs can come off a screen and hit a 3/jumper? I count 0   Who on the Mavs is a plus passer? I count 0 outside of Luka  Who on the Mavs is a plus defender? DFS and that's it  They have a bunch of slightly above average shooters , but mostly just average guys in the NBA. And that's why they were the 5th seed. I think they're rated properly which is that when they're going against a talented Clips team with defenders like Kawhi, PG, etc. no one really could anything going outside of Luka"
National Player of the Year Jalen Brunson
"&gt;The Mavs can't run things through Porzingis and Jalen Brunson dropped a stinker in the series, so they really didn't have any other options.  That was supposed to be Josh Richardson. They traded away shooting (Seth Curry) for better playmaking and defense. But then they used him as a spot-up shooter."
"This season devolved for a myriad of reasons and I think this trade was part of it, but I think the Mavs overachieved last year to even make the playoffs and didn't get heaps better so it makes sense to me that they made the playoffs and saw an early exit. I believe my prediction to myself (and thus, my season expectation/hope) at the beginning of the season was a 6-seed and a first round exit, so they even outperformed that. Contextually, the only team above the Mavs in the West from last season that got visibly worse (to me) from last year were the Rockets (by a lot), Thunder (by a lot), and Clippers (by not so much and in fact this Clippers iteration may be more successful, who knows, NBA is weird) whereas teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Nuggets and Suns got objectively better/healthier.  Mavs didn't do very much to make a leap. It always felt like this was the last season of experimentation to me. Try some lineup/player type combinations and see what sticks. I think we learned a lot. DFS took a huge leap in the 2nd half of the season (but didn't really bring it consistently to the playoffs), it's unclear whether Maxi is finally regressing or just too beaten up to be usable, KP is probably not the second star/unicorn they wanted him to be due to injury or mental stuff, but more visibly, we carried 4 nearly unplayable rookies (I like Josh Green and want to see him develop, but I don't believe he's currently an NBA player) a super narrow Boban, and a Trey Burke all season. You just can't have 5-6 guys on an NBA roster who see  next to no minutes other than garbage time and expect to be a deep playoff contender, y'know? That's possibly a roster management issue and I think Donnie's seat is a little hot (and should be), but mostly it says to me that this team was not constructed with the goal of competing for a title and I think that's fine, not every team should be so long as there's a plan for the future (which I do think there is!).  I always believed that the roadmap looked something like this: Year 1 of Luka was just play with Dirk, have some fun, adjust to the speed of the NBA, get the torch passed, etc. Year 2 was letting Luka be the guy for better or for worse, put the offense in the hands of a kid who can't drink in the US yet and see what you have. Maybe get him a potential partner/2nd option if the deal is right and experiment with that. Probably won't make the playoffs, that's fine, who cares. Start collecting some expirings for the next season or two and point towards a FA year that you think could end up strong. Year 3 is the low playoff seed year (unless you use the offseason pre-Y3 to get a big splashy FA, Dallas didn't) and get some experience under the brightest lights. Year 4 is probably the FA target year. You get 1 more season before Luka's superduperubermax prevents you from affording much and requires strong drafting/scouting, so use it wisely. This FA class could've had Giannis (someone Donnie had been vocal about wanting to draft, but Cuban shut down because he wanted cap space for one last title run with Dirk), could still have Kawhi, Jrue Holiday, Oladipo, etc., that's a pretty reasonable FA class to target in on 2-3 years out. Year 4 would be the opening of the window and for as long as you have Luka + 2nd star, you'll be a top 4 seed in the West (provided no injuries or whatever)   I think the biggest deal people don't realize or sweep under the rug with Seth is that he has some red flags. He's nearly 31, wanted starter minutes (Philly did give him nearly 29 MPG this season compared to Dallas' 24.6 last year, which is effectively what Brunson played this year (25)), but has historically been a pretty underwhelming defender in addition to being a low volume shooter. He only averages about 5 3s attempted per game. He's a flashy scorer (and is a Curry) but he takes pretty ""safe"" shots. We have no idea what he looks like with a higher volume if he say, took THJ amounts of shots, because he's just never really done it for a whole season. His line looks a lot like Jalen and I think we'd just much rather have Jalen who is 6 years younger than Curry and still able to develop.  I also digress. Ultimately, I'm sad right now/today/this week, but I think the truth is the Mavs performed as-expected/as-hoped. There were a lot of downs this season (for us AND everyone else, COVID sucks) but some ups too. This offseason is going to impact the future of this franchise likely more than any offseason outside of 2019 and I have no reason to not be optimistic and will continue to be optimistic until proven otherwise and if that happens, we'll go from there I guess."
what's wrong with Jalen Brunson that he can't be that guy?
"I think a Myles Turner + TJ Warren for KP + Jalen Brunson trade would benefit both teams. KP goes to a lower pressure environment where he, Sabonis and Brogdon would have more ball movement. The Pacers get a potential starting level point guard in Brunson. The Mavs obtain the rim protector and rim runner in hometown native Myles Turner and they get a high risk, high reward secondary offensive option in TJ Warren."
"Jalen Brunson was the second playmaker during the regular season, but he had some really bad games against the Clippers."
We have it in Jalen Brunson but we have to keep him benched so when Luka is off the floor we have something.
Jalen Brunson was trash this series
And Jalen Brunson
And Jalen Brunson
I initially mis-read your comment as just player they had drafted. It seems like a weird thing to criticize DAL over as they had just drafted those players before ATL did. Meaning they had been on rookie scale contracts but they just expired.   Luka Doncic  Josh Green  Tyrell Terry  Jalen Brunson  and then DFS is making 4 mil a year for the next 3 years or so
Right. They would also win if Jalen Brunson played like Jordan. Not sure which is more likely to happen :)
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
"That's his style cause the team has no other good playmakers. The best secondary playmaker is who, Jalen Brunson who's just a good bench guard, Josh Richardson?"
"I don’t think that’s true. DFS is a great defender and efficient shooter. I’d take him over Marcus Morris. Jalen Brunson has been talked about as a 6th man of the year candidate. I’d take him over Reggie Jackson even tho Reggie had a good game. Decided to play trey instead of him. Kristaps should be the best big on the floor (I guess coaching has nothing to do with him being a shit player now and don’t use the injuries excuse as he’s been healthy long enough). Rotation was garbage. Playing 2 physically limited bigs in kristaps and Boban at the same time seems stupid.   Boban getting burned on defense could have had Powell in who had a great game the other day getting offensive boards like a beast. THJ is a good player, but I see a lot of contested 3s from him. Not  many offball screens. Nobody can get a rhythm if it’s just Luka isolations/pick and rolls and some rolls to Boban every once in a while for the most part. And an occasional pass to a shooter"
Jalen Brunson easily could have played 17 min and been as bad or slightly less bad lol
If you think Jalen Brunson impacted this series in a major way you are not interested in having any convo seriously on this subject
"KP is way better than he showed this post-season. I think with an offseason to get healthy (for however long he can stay healthy I suppose) and hopefully a trade, I think he will suprise a lot of people. Jalen Brunson is another guy on the Mavs that is way better than he looked in the playoffs. The Mavs system just isn't really conducive to anyone but Luka looking good, for better or worse."
"Yeah KP ""13/4/1"" Porzingis , Josh ""Can't make the floor"" Richardson, Trey ""Where am I?"" Burke, Tim ""Coinflip"" Hardaway, Jalen ""Regular Season"" Brunson ain't that bad. Right...."
"Legitimately he lost POY to Jalen Brunson because people were sick of the hype for some weird fucking reason.  Trae Young dragged a mediocre at best Oklahoma team to the NCAA tournament while leading the country in points and assists per game.  Jalen Brunson wasn't even the best player on his own team but won the award over Trae due to his efficiency or whatever.  Easy to be really efficient when you're surrounded by like 5 other NBA players.  Not intended to be a dig at Brunson at all, he's a great player.  I'll just never understand how he won that over Trae."
"even more lol, glenn robinson jr and glenn robinson iii, rick brunson and jalen brunson.  others that were close were sabonis (dad returned to europe in 03-04 for final year), gary payton whos son keeps just missing out on playing lebron, dale davis whos son is projected late first round, scottie pippen whos son will go to the nba soon but scottie didnt play lebron in lebrons rookie season and retired.  there also quite a few high schoolers too, like mike miller's son, mutombo's son, wade's son. etc"
He was WAY better than Jalen Brunson and Trey Burke are you serious? And they weren’t the only guys on the team you’re conveniently leaving out guys like Ariza Gordon Austin Rivers NeNe Tucker. Stop it lol
Lost faith in Jalen Brunson smh he’s only played 3 minutes so far
Trey Burke over Jalen Brunson is interesting
Is Jalen Brunson hurt? Why Burke over him??
"Jalen Brunson has been a bit of disappointment in the play-offs, hasn't he? He was fucking torching teams in the regular season."
"Come on, Jalen! When I said Nova Brunson, I didn’t mean playing like a college player in the NBA!"
MPJ could be one of the most efficient scorers in the league. SGA has all NBA potential. JJJ has all star potential. Jalen Brunson was top 5 in 6MotY this year.
He has...  3. Rick and Jalen Brunson.  4. Gary Payton and Gary Payton II (on roster but never logged minutes against Lebron)  5. Glenn Robinson Jr/III  6. Gary Trent Sr/Jr
"I think Bron has also played against Jalen Brunson's dad, Rick Brunson."
Jalen Brunson looks like a human bobblehead
"Jalen Brunson is a beast, can see Nova all through his game"
Jalen “come at me bitch” Brunson
Its very early and still a lot of panning out for these guys but honestly I think this is better overall than both because of how deep it is guys like landry shamet jalen brunson kevin huerter robert williams devontae graham late first rounders early second rounders having some pretty solid roles on good teams so mix in the top guys of the draft with all the other good role players and its super well rounded
"To be fair Luka has GOAT potential, which automatically puts this class up a tier from a lot of other classes. Trae probably doesn't have top 10 potential but top 30 i think is where his ceiling could be. Ayton has work to do but his upside is right around where Trae's is. MPJ is below those two but will be a very very good player if he stays health. Then you consider depth and guys like SGA, JJJ, Sexton, Mikael and Miles Bridges who could all be all stars,  excellent role players like Rob Williams,  Jalen Brunson,  Devontae Graham, Mitchel Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Anfrenee Simons, Donte Divencenzo, Landry Shamet, Lonnie Walker,Bruce Brown, Shake Milton it just goes on and on. All of these guys are either averaging double digit scoring, playing big minutes on a contender, or both.   They definately might have a case for best all time when its all said and done tbh"
"it shows how errors can compound and absolutely torpedo team building for sure.  They had a rough 2016 offseason, so then Olshey doesn't have roster spots for multiple draft picks in the 2017 draft, so he trades up to take a home-run swing on Collins.  Just imagine Derrick White in a back-court with Dame &amp; CJ instead of Biggie Swanigan, he's exactly the kind of guard they need.    2018 was also sneaky bad because instead of taking Simons, another home run swing that fit the Zach Collins timeline instead of the Dame &amp; CJ timeline, they could have drafted Jalen Brunson (playing crunchtime for Dallas and was in the 6MOTY convo this year) or they could have simply taken GTJ in the first, thereby giving the team another year of cheap control over his rights, which would've been critical for a super capped out team that needed bargain production!  If they'd just drafted GTJ over Simons, he'd still be on the team, but instead they had to trade him because he got too expensive too quickly and now Simons took so long to develop they have to make a decision on him without a ton of data to go off of.  I give him a pass on Nas Little in 2019, that late in the 1st it's tough to identify talent and he's actually shown some good flashes of potential as a piece they can use.  I've said it before &amp; will say it again, no coach in history could get passable defense out of a Simons/Melo/Kanter 2nd unit, that's on Neil much more than it is on Stotts."
"2018 has just some solid ass players all around whether they in the playoffs or not right now:  Ayton, Doncic, Jackson Jr., Trae, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Divencenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr., Anfernee Simons, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen. A lot of quality picks."
"that draft was so deep. Robert Williams, Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte' Graham, Jalen Brunson were all picked between 27 and 37"
reminds me of Jalen Brunson. Seriously insane value for their contracts
"And Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson and Donte DiVincenzo all won a championship together at Villanova. What a loaded team."
Luka is 6’8. Jalen Brunson and Dirk both confirmed that when they were on Redick podcast
"&gt;A lefty hasn't won finals MVP since Willis Reed in 1973  Jalen Brunson: ""Say less!"""
"Reddick was actually talking about this with Jalen Brunson. Role players will always look inconsistent because if the ball's not in your hands, you don't get in the flow of the offense. That's what I was worried about last night. Nobody was getting touches and they did it looked sloppy. When KP fumbled the ball it was like his 3rd touch, that finally came in the 4th(I think it was the fourth).   That's why LeBron passes it up early so everyone can find their rhythm."
"That's a hideous looking box score from the Mavs. I thought Hardaway played great but playing above himself as a #2 scoring threat on any NBA team. KP was disappointing...again.   Interesting to note, not one other Mav outside of Luka and Tim had double digits in ANY stat other than minutes.   Real Q for the Mavs fans, when is Jalen Brunson going to fully emerge?"
"You're right, dallas should play more jalen brunson-boban marjanovic pick and rolls or tim hardaway jr. - dwigh powell handoffs. If all of that fails, they can always give the ball to porzingis for a logo 3 with 20 seconds on the shot clock."
Also for Brunson &amp; Maxi to both be more involved on offense. Jalen only having 2 points ain't gonna cut it especially when we need him to be the point guard when Luka's not on the floor making everything happen
Lot of these guys don’t realize how short Carlisle has made the rotation. Jalen Brunson was arguably our 6MOTY (apart from THJ) and he isn’t getting a lot of minutes neither. Doesn’t mean he’s ass all of a sudden. Just the clippers are beating us up when Luka isn’t on the court
"That's Jalen Brunson, but hard to put him in later in the game when he's only 6 foot and not a premier defender. Really need THJ/Dorian in there for those reasons. Could maybe use THJ as a ball handler idk"
"Tyrese Haliburton, OG Anunoby, Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Lu Dort, Dejounte Murray"
"Ehh PP is already 23 and has some serious physical limitations. Obviously Kemba came into the league at like 21 and is also undersized, but his development into an All-Star was a real anomaly.  Realistically I see Pritchard as a Jalen Brunson, Monte Morris type player. Borderline starter, every team in the league would love to have them, but no one is throwing assets to trade for them, or offer a huge contract."
CJ McCollum sucks. Blazers are gonna regret not trading him for Jalen Brunson
"PG: Jalen Brunson  SG: D Rose  SF: Boucher  PF: Ingles  C: Bobby Portis   Bench: Rondo, Clarkson, Thad Young, and Gallo.   This team would be stacked lowkey 👀"
They’ve got Trey Burke and Jalen Brunson but they don’t start for them so Luka facilitates.
"I like Jalen Brunson on the Mavs, he’s a UFA this season."
"The Mavs did use KP’s height advantage a few times. They got Morris to commit his 5th foul competing for position on a post up and they got a couple threes for Jalen Brunson off the doubles the Clippers sent at KP (one of them was during that stretch). He also got two looks in the fourth, a fade over Jackson and one over George, both missed. Another KP post up led to a Rondo steal as he came to double on the pass.   The real problem to me with KP’s offense here is those post ups aren’t going to be too devastating if George or a similarly sized players switches onto him. The Clippers helped the Mavs here by fouling and unnecessarily doubling KP. If KP wants to post up Paul George and take his fade-away, I would live with that all day."
Jalen Brunson should have played more tonight.
"Didn't think this series was quite over cause the mavericks have never shown the ability to actually slow down the clippers, just outscore them. Clippers really seemed to have figured something out by mercilessly attacking Jalen Brunson and KP with Kawhi as the ball handler, getting the double and swinging it to the corner"
Jalen Brunson been BIG tonight
thats ncaa champ jalen brunson
Jalen Brunson is good
I like Jalen Brunson. That guy will eventually go full Fred Fanvfeet
Jalen Brunson is a liability
PG and Kawhi for Jalen Brunson
"I meant Jalen Brunson, his dad played on the last Knicks team to make the finals and the Clippers funny enough"
I think he just made a harmless joke but Jalen Brunson and Tommy didn’t really catch it.

"Was Trae a nationally recognized HS prospect? I don’t follow prospects like that anymore, but I went to a HS in the same division as Jalen Brunson’ as (same age as him) and I remember we used to go crazy in the student section when we played his school because everyone knew he was the #1 HS prospect that year for colleges."
"Was Trae a nationally recognized HS prospect?

"that’s right - #13, Jalen Marquis Brunson"
"Home court advantage probably edges it to Utah. Rudy also turns into Hakeem Olajuwon whenever he faces the Mavericks, so I'm hoping that happens in the playoffs.  With that said, I don't know how we're gonna stop Jalen Brunson."
"Even in a bench player lineup, Jordan Clarkson needs to come off the bench. He’s pretty purely a microwave scorer and thrives most off the bench. You’re better off starting Jalen Brunson or Josh Richardson and removing Herro from the team.  Can’t think of someone right now I feel but there’s better guys to have than Melo"
" Nah the only player under 6’5 in the Dallas rotation is Jalen Brunson who is actually decent for a small guard. It’s a very well built team, similar to the 2019 Raptors."
"Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson"
"Ty Lue is NOT a good coach, my guess is even after getting waxed in the regular season by the Mavs, he probably viewed the Mavs as: 1 really good player in Luka and a wild card in KP and he favors his duo of Kahwi + George.     The reality is the Mavs are DEEP.  THJr &amp; Jalen Brunson are 6th man candidates.  Maxi, Dorian Finney Smith, and Josh Richardson have become very polished role players.     The Mavs do have a super star, and some nights a wild card star in KP but they are just a really good team."
"Yes, he became a Cowboys fan when he joined the Mavs in Dallas, which has led to some absolutely hilarious shit with Jalen Brunson who is an Eagles fan."
It’s like the clippers guys don’t have roles. All of them try to make a shot off of a dribble iso. They defensively switch every screen so luka has gotten whoever he wants to guard him and mavs players have been shooting well from 3. Jalen Brunson has been huge as a playmaker with the ball in his hands while luka isn’t in charge. Mavs have had an answer for everything the clippers have thrown at them and then some.
"I know it's easy to hate on the Clippers - I hate on them regularly. And I am also happy to see them down 2-0 in this series.  &amp;#x200B;  But I don't really think this is their ""fault"". I think Luka is just the best player in this series and the Mavs are just good as the Clippers are if not better. The Mavs were hurt the first half of the season and totally out of sorts. They could easily have been the 2-3 seed in a normal year. If this were, say, the 3/6 matchup with the Mavs at the 3 then we probably wouldn't be discussing things the way we are now.  &amp;#x200B;  Are we sure the Clippers are a better team than the Mavs? I really don't think so. Luka is clearly the best player, and even if you think PG is a better player than KP, the rest of the rosters don't even compare.  Do you like anyone on this Clippers roster outside of Kawai or PG?  &amp;#x200B;  Kennard? Morris? Jackson? Beverly? I don't think this is a good team at all. These dudes have one foot out the NBA door and the other wedged into the Shanghai Sharks bench.  &amp;#x200B;  I think THJ, Richardson, and Kleiber are better than anyone 3 - 15 on the Clips and maybe even Finney-Smith too. Hell, I might take Jalen Brunson over Batum, Beverly, or reggie Jackson at this point.  &amp;#x200B;  Basically this is Kawai and PG and trash vs Luka and good role players. And Luka is the best player in the series.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't get me wrong. I hate the Clippers. But I don't blame them for being down in this series. They aren't the better team."
"We still have guys that can give us good minutes that havent even been used in these two games. Trey Burke is great at defending small guards and can be a microwave scorer at any moment (great for playoff series when energy needed). We have Josh Richardson, a guy who has been starting for playoff teams, coming off the bench. Hardaway/Finney Smith/Kleber all 40% 3 point shooters. Jalen And then Brunson finished top 5 in 6moy voting. If we need to exploit a mismatch, we throw in Boban. There's just a lot of stuff we can do with out roster and we have a coach in Rick Carlisle who knows exactly when to pull one of these cards.  We lack top-end talent outside of Luka. But we have a very deep team. And when the Clippers cannot contain Luka it makes those role players job much easier. Clippers also have good depth, but similarly lack mid-level talent outside of Kawhi/PG. Batum/Ibaka/Bev/Rondo/Zubac are all great players to have on a playoff roster, but you don't want any of those guys being your third best player. Still got a shooter like Kennard, defender like Mann to bring specific traits to the floor as well. Both teams are deep, but missing a bit in starting level talent."
THJ would probably be the Clippers 3rd best player. Finney Smith and Josh Richardson are both really solid role players and Kleber is a perfect floor spacing big for Luka because he also happens to be a good Kawhi defender. Not to mention Jalen Brunson who's one of the best backup PGs in the league. The team around Luka isn't perfect by any means but it's pretty damn good.
They’re no names because they aren’t 6moty frontrunners (a field that’s been dominated by the Utah duo and D-Rose all season) but THJ and Jalen Brunson are incredibly efficient scorers who excel at shooting threes. I don’t think any mavs fan is surprised seeing them hit shots
What the fuck is this comment lol. Porzingis? Tim Hardaway JR was the best 6th man in the league this year? Jalen Brunson is another great piece. They have a solid ass team idk why that’s hard for this sub to accept
Jalen Brunson says fuck Ty Lue
"Nah. Jalen Brunson gets pummeled and nothing.  KP didn't touch PG, PG travels but gets the and-1.  Kawhi leads with off arm, no charge, but gets fouled by the softest touch ever.   I can go on, but being down 2 after getting hosed by the refs is not exactly bad."
Jalen Brunson has turned into a very solid role player for us
I was hoping Jalen Brunson would get some votes. He's a timely bucket every night. Just righting the ship. Love that dude.
Good to see our boy Jalen Brunson getting recognition  Sad that he felt short being nominated by small margin
Puttin a word in for  * Jalen Brunson * Richaun Holmes
Active Players? #13 has: Harden - Bog. Bogdanovic - PG - Adebayo - JJJ.  Jalen Brunson is the 6th man tho.
"Jalen Brunson on Dallas also gets that gym rat thing. Its usually related with athleticism bias of people. The way Doncic is underrated before draft was solely on lack of athleticism (whiteness). If underrated, physically less gifted guy do good things on the court, then they get this gym rat title. FVV could be another example"
"I could see the team moving on from Brook Lopez to improve the roster. Giannis and Middleton are too potent to give up on as both players are still in the front end of their prime.   Purely hypothetical, but a line-up of Giannis, Middleton, Jrue, Seth Curry, and Myles Turner, with Divincenzo, Portis, Tucker and Jalen Brunson off the bench. Or even swapping Jrue with someone like Brogdon would help (though I think Jrue's defense is a huge part of the Bucks' overall chances).  Point is, with Giannis, you've always got a chance, and with Middleton, you've got a legitimate 2nd option that can create his own shot. This team can contend for a very long time no matter who fills out roster."
Jalen Brunson went to my middle school/high school and lived 10 min away from me. I also used to play Fortnite with Josh Richardson almost every day
"Jersey brings:  - Kyrie / Jalen Brunson - Deandre Bembry - Kyle Anderson - JJJ / Kenny Faried  - KAT / Bam / Naz  Shaq or JR coaching, either way it’s hilarious."
Jalen Brunson confirmed better center then Drummond
"I can't let this post go by without pointing out that Jalen Brunson was at 79.9% this year. Jalen Brunson is 6'1""."

The amount of Jalen is actually unsettling:  - Jalen Suggs - Jalen Green - Jalen Duren - Jalen Harris - Jalen Lewis - Jalen Adams - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Lecque - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith - Jalen Wilson - Jalen Pickett
On the Mavs Jalen Brunson has that vibe.
Jalen Brunson for Mitchell Robinson in a sign and trade
I went to basketball camp with Jalen Brunson and heard him say that he was named after Jalen Rose
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De’Andre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9.

Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
"*Disclaimer: My take on this*  It sounds like a trade deadline offer from Indy. This in no way shape or form makes sense for Indy now as opposed to a couple months ago. I have 0 inside information on this season. but I'm willing to bet that Brogdon was one of the lead guys in the locker room that had a problem with Bjorkgren before that situation boiled all the way over. He's a smart guy and I can see him having a Philadelphia Jimmy-style problem with Indy's coaching staff. Especially in a year where they underperformed internal expectations the math adds up for me.  This however makes 0 sense now because Ben Simmons is the least Carlisle-like guard i think i have ever seen whereas Carlisle would love a guy like Brogdon. The Mavs brought Delon Wright in and then Wright quickly fell out of Carlisle's rotation because Wright was very deferential and indecisive in Dallas. At the end of the Dirk era on Carlisle has built a very guard reliant system predicated on quick decisions and conviction where the guard decides to go with the ball. Luka embodies this now, before Luka it was DSJ and other aggressive score first guards like Barea, Beaubois, and Monta Ellis he really personally gravitated to (even Jalen Brunson). I can't think of a single $20 mil.+ guard that fits that description worse than Ben Simmons.  I think Philly is releasing this now as a smokescreen to artificially prop Simmons' value up because Brogdon, Lamb, and a first may very well be where Simmons' value currently tops out"
Jalen Brunson
Again I think what you’re really arguing here is the Mavericks offense is predictable because they have nobody else to give the ball to (which I agree). The Mavs were a -42 in the 55 minutes Luka sat against the Clippers in that 7 game series. Luka is an excellent scorer at all 3 levels and is one of the best passers in the game so I’m not sure what’s predictable about that. His usage rate is extremely high because the Mavericks legitimately have 0 other initiators on the roster save for Jalen Brunson. The Mavs offense erodes in the 4th because of Luka fatigue and teams aggressively doubling Luka and daring other Mavericks to make plays which most cannot.
Hopefully Jalen Brunson is next.
"Wow, Jalen Brunson catching strays"
Jalen Brunson torched my school quite a few times. You can just tell that some dudes have that “it factor.”
"A) I was just doing the last few drafts   B) I would never get him confused with anyone else, he is arguably my favorite player.  I genuinely get almost all of these names mixed up, other than Jaren Jackson and Jalen Brunson"
"Off topic, but its getting so hard for me to keep track of these younger players and prospects who have similar names. There are so many guys in recent drafts or in the upcoming drafts (especially some of the higher rated prospects) that have names like Jalen, Jaylen, Jaden, Jaren etc that I keep mixing them up. In this case there literally was a guy named Jalen McDaniels the year before Jaden McDaniels which is what caused me to go down this rabbit hole   2018: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson  2019: Jaylen Norwell, Jaylen Hands, Jalen McDaniels  2020: Jalen Smith, Jaden McDaniels, Jalen Harris,  2021: Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Jaden Springer, Jared Butler  2022: Jaden Hardy, Jaden Ivey  2023-24: Jalen Duran, Jalen Washington, Jaden Bradley, Jalen Lewis, Jaylen Clark, Jayden Nicholson  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk"
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
"Shot creators mean they can simply create shots for themselves. Hunter and reddish can, they don’t require a clear setup. I’m not sure how you don’t consider themselves on that level.   The reason I mentioned lob threats, in case you haven’t noticed, is that the hawks have the most lobs, which is part of the reason capela has been so good. Our big men don’t have to create for themselves, and with traes floater, have one of the best offensive systems in the league. Lobs might not be as valuable for other teams, but it fits our team perfectly, and John Collins is already top 5 in the league at it.   Isolation possessions don’t determine whether you can create your shot, there’s so many other statistics. Gary Trent and jalen Brunson are below 5 percent, they obviously create their own shot. The statistics you used don’t tell an accurate picture at all."
"I’d love Jalen Brunson backing up Trae lol. And I feel like KP still has something left in the tank, just needs a fresh start"
Luka’s most reliable Robin is Tim Hardaway Jr. or Dorian Finney Smith and Jalen Brunson as Alfred.
"Dude, he never shuts the fuck up in the Mavs sub about how great Seth is and how terrible Jalen Brunson is. Like, who the fuck hates Jalen Brunson?"
Wtf? No way man. Not sure if this is bait but Mavs should totally add Jalen Brunson there to even it out smh
KP and Jalen Brunson
"Sign and trade THJ + Jalen Brunson.  Speaking on behalf of Cuban, we'll also gladly throw in Valar Vulgaris too."
Not the same position but Barkley was a transcendent player at 5 and Trae at least has a chance at working towards being that if he continues rising.   I’ll assume Jalen Brunson is Stockton.
https://youtu.be/aVKSh0Maj1o  apparently this is seth curry's 1 career dunk  https://youtu.be/Eapz5dzyHSg  jalen brunson has 4 career dunks (all in his rookie year?) but nothing popped out in the first few search results so here he is in ncaa
It's [nothing special](https://www.foxsports.com/watch/1465391683711) but Jalen Brunson definitely has.
I'm not sure I've ever seen Seth Curry or Jalen Brunson dunk
"The Jalen Brunson - Luke Ridnour comparison is a random one but it seems very accurate to me.  The Donovan Mitchell pre-draft comparisons (Avery Bradley, Gary Harris, etc) look silly because we now know how good he is offensively as a ball handler and pull up shooter.  Generally most 3 and D prospects have pretty accurate comparisons. OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, etc. are pretty much who we thought they'd be in terms of play style."
"Jalen Brunson vs jarret Allen is the 1v1 I didn’t know I didn’t wanna see    But to answer your question, I don’t know."
"Doncic, Trae Young, Ayton, Mikal Bridges, JJJ, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Jalen Brunson, Shake Milton,... 2018 was the year the NBA gods smiled upon Draft Day. At this rate it will be one of the all time great draft years littered with MVP's, All-Stars, 6MOY's, DPOY,..."
Somebody mixes up the names and you get Jalen Brunson and Josh Green from the Mavs
"It’s insanely good. You have two superstars in Trae and Luka. Ayton right now I think is a star. There are potential/near stars in JJJ, MPJ, SGA, and Mikal Bridges (imo, though maybe a solid starter). Solid starters include Miles Bridges, Sexton, WCJ, and Huerter.   This is where it gets tricky, but the guys somewhere between solid starter and really good role player are bountiful, and a lot came in the second round: Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Bagley, Shamet, Lonnie Walker, Bruce Brown, Jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, and Shake Milton.  I’m probably leaving out a few guys, which is a testament to how good a draft class it is. We need more time to see longevity and how many stars arise to truly rate it though."
"This dude was the first freshman to lead the NCAA in points and assists and he lost national player to Jalen Brunson, who wasn't even the best player on his own team. He's been hated for a while"
"Lol bigger size doesn't automatically mean more positions  He would get absolutely exposed on defense by small quick guards like Jalen Brunson or Darius Garland, let alone premier starting guards like Kyrie or De'Aaron  I'd imagine he is more of a wing on the defensive end"
Tingus Pingus with Jalen Brunson as the primary ball handler lmaooooooooooooooooooo 1-71
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
"Not a lot of room for an undersized PG on a contending team in the west, especially with Jalen Brunson was a fringe 6MOY candidate.  That being said, wasn't it rumored that Harambob forced you all to draft Josh Green over Saddiq Bey? Oof."
Killian Hayes is now destined for a Jalen Brunson type role
Jalen Brunson
"Porzingis, THJ, Jalen Brunson, Powell. Not saying yall have another star, but you have solid players. Not like Luka is playing with G-leaguers like Book had to for years"
Granted Ayton isn't the best player on his team. And imagine if Luka had nearly shot himself out of game 7 against the Clippers but been carried most of the way by Jalen Brunson or Dwight Powell...
"Jalen Brunson, WCS, and DPowell weren’t in the bubble or hurt, so 3 and not 4 my b. Then KP got injured in game 1 of the series, but still played hurt in 2/3, didn’t play the next 3. Also got the BS ejection in game 1 that the Mavs had a big shot at winning. He was averaging 30 in the bubble last year.   But the Suns this year are better than the Mavs last and this year is what I’m saying. I’m not sure what exactly you’re arguining because it’s not really disputable that the Suns minus Booker are easily better than the Mavs minus Luka. Bookers supporting cast is definitely better."
"&gt;The only NBA player with an affluent background I remember of is Jose Calderon.  ? Are you not aware of the many NBA players whose fathers played in the league?  Steph, Klay, Tim Hardaway, Jalen Brunson, KJ Martin, Cole Anthony, Jae Crowder, Bol Bol, etc. List goes on and on."
PG: Monte Morris/Jalen Brunson  SG: Shake Milton  SF: Matisse Thybulle/Jalen McDaniels  PF: OG Anunoby/George's Niang  C: Pascal Siakam/Reggie Perry  We don't get draft picks
"It’s a really, really good class. Ayton, Luka, Trae, Jaren Jackson, MPJ, Mitchell Robinson, Lonnie Walker, Mikal Bridges, and Jalen Brunson are all at the very least quality rotational players, at most superstars. That’s just off the top of my head, there’s probably more."
Simmions for Jalen Brunson and KP.
"Jalen Brunson,Tingus pingus,and some picks for Ben Simmons who says no"
"Getting nothing out of the draft for years after years was Donnie's main undoing. Nor did his bestie, Rick, help him. Their two combined attitudes towards young players ensured a very dark period as Dirk aged. Mavs continued to get nothing out of the draft, we continued to not invest much time into developing those players in good years and bad years.    It's not unusual to notice Rick taking a real dislike towards certain players. The Salah incident was one. How he treated Roddy Beaubois many years before was another. Then you can count the endless draft picks that just didn't make it with Rick (which on a side-note, gotta praise Jalen Brunson for being a rare exception)"
"Who did he freeze out? Can you genuinely tell me a time where the Mavs would have been better off with someone else handling the ball during the Clips series? Sans Jalen Brunson (who is a score-first SG in a PG body), who else do you trust to make good passes and handle the ball for more than 5 seconds?"
"im tired of ppl saying Luka had no help when everybody else on the team performed except KP and richardson. No one mentions THJ being on fire, Finney smith playing unreal on both ends, Kleber making every shot, and Jalen Brunson providing scoring off the bench. It’s funny af how everyone just ignores the games where the rest of his teammates steped the fuck up"
"Are y’all on crack?   Bogdanovic, Capela, John Collins, Gallinari, Huerter, Deandre Hunter, &amp; Lou Will is comparable if not WORSE to you than Porzingis, Tim Hardaway, and like, Jalen Brunson and Kleber? Old man JJ Reddick?   Seriously? I literally attended OU while Trae Young was a student, I love the guy, but I’m not going to say he’s better than Luka for being in the East 2nd round when we know for a fact the Clippers would have also beat this Hawks team."
"You guys just eat anything the media tells you.. I'm guessing this sub is generally too young to understand that journalism is 99% full of shit.    Donnie can feel whatever he wants, doesn't change the moves the org made the last few years. That's more likely the reason why Cuban and whoever else felt it was time to move on. They have a generational superstar with a badly constructed roster around him, meaning the future doesn't look good.    The best young, growing players around Luka is... Jalen Brunson. A backup guard. The rest? Dwight? Unplayable. Maxi? Think we've seen he's a good bench player, not a starter who should be guarding the other team's best wing on a consistent basis. Burke? Out of the rotation for a reason. Richardson? Gone, bad trade, not much of a fit. List goes on, he failed at his job the last few years."
"He drafted him, he'll forever be a pal, but boy, everyone wants to read way too much into nothing. At the end of the day, Donnie's built a pretty poor squad around Luka that doesn't have much of a future and I would guess Luka can see that looking around the league.    You're committed to guys like Dwight Powell who isn't really playable against most playoff teams. THJ is a great player, but 20m for a streaky shooter that makes a living off tough shots who at 29 isn't going to change his game much. It goes on..  Part of it is not having the opportunity for multiple high draft picks to build a core around Luka like the Hawks or the Griz before Ja. But even those teams found gems later in the first or second like Brooks. All Donnie's got of late is Jalen Brunson."
Ehh last years team relied heavily on Tim Hardaway JR.  Jalen Brunson became virtually useless in the Clippers series because he couldn’t create.  Porzingis sucked.  (He was good in 2020).  They had to play Boban last year because nobody outside of Luka could create.  But maybe you didn’t watch the series?  Having shooters mean nothing against a team like the Clippers who switch everything.  Shooters kill drop back schemes not teams who switch 1 through 5.  The Clippers could stay home and rotate and then the shooter did nothing because no one outside of Luka can attack a close out.  So yeah that’s a poorly constructed team.
lol midickey jormickey doesnt have the skills to play in today's game.  he was too fat too slow too weak. imagine him trying to guard jalen brunson
"Yep, he won DPOY as a guard while matching up against guys like Jalen Brunson, Markus Howard, Shamorie Ponds, and Myles Powell"
What say you of Jalen Brunson?
"Steph, Lebron, Bam, Middleton, Jrue  Bench: Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Noel, Duncan Robinson, Ingles, Haliburton, O’Neale"

jalen brunson. i can never clearly understand how he torches us every time we play against him. he just does.
"It's funny that you're getting downvoted because I think you're right.  Disclaimer: mavs fan from Dallas who's lived in NY for the last decade, who's a frank believer, and who also thinks dragic is good and a nearly-perfect fit with Luka as a secondary ball handler. This is not an indictment on dragic, more-so a discussion of fit and team identity.  The reality is that frankie smokes doesn't really need to fit what dragic would be for us, and that's okay. Frank needs to play decent defense and hit an open 3 (easier said than done with him, I feel you Knicks fans). That role is essentially what DFS and maxi have become. I think it's more than doable frank can do it (again Knicks fans, I know many of you are already beyond that point).  It seems like the goal with the signing is that the mavs wanna put at least 2-3 decent wing defenders on the floor at any given time. Getting cooked by PG and Kawhi two years in a row isn't sitting so well...So now we have dfs, frank, bullock, maxi, and sterling brown. All (except frank) have become serviceable 3 and D guys. If he can hit 3's at a consistent clip, frank fits right into that.   All that being said, we haven't fixed our need for a secondary ball handler, cuz frank...ain't it. In that way, the jokes are warranted.   That's what's scary here. It's like the team is planning for the best-case scenario, which is Luka being mvp-level, KP showing out consistently, and jalen Brunson becoming a true second-team facilitator. Again, that's best case. Brunson has shown he can weave and get buckets, but passing isn't his thing. So, overall, planning that way might backfire for dallas.  Doesn't seem like Toronto will buy dragic out. They don't have any reason to. So who exactly is gonna lessen Luka's burden? I don't see it yet with the current team."
"The team absolutely needs him to lol, you want to take the ball out of your top 5 player's hands and let Jalen Brunson run pick and rolls?"
Who else do you want to handle the ball? Jalen Brunson who has 0 vision. KP who has struggled massively after his meniscus tear? THJ who is really streaky? Luka is the reliable offensive player on the mavs and none of y’all seem to understand that.
"If we're not talking ""obvious freak athletes"", I would say Steve Nash, Tony Parker, old Ginobili, etc. for the slashers. Regular season Jalen Brunson is also good at it.  You can look at [paint touches](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/paint-touch/?sort=PAINT_TOUCHES&amp;dir=1) and just sort out some names, pick out ones who are usually not lob finishers and use their footwork, physicality, and savvy to score. Jokic and Kanter come to mind."
"There were individual forwards who initiated the offense before Nellie, like Rick Barry on the Warriors.  But those situations were more about the individual player having playmaking skills. Nellie was the first coach to really implement the point forward as a system.   When Pressey tested, Marques Johnson took over as the point forward. The backup point was another forward.  That's different than say, the Lakers. LeBron plays point forward, but it's not the whole Lakers system. When LeBron rested, it wasn't Kyle Kuzma running the offense, it was a regular PG like Shroeder. Or like how when Luka sits, Jalen Brunson runs the offense instead of another forward."
"In five years, people will be saying Luka and Jalen Brunson. Just wait."
"Interestingly enough, neither Aldridge or Roy were actually drafted by Portland themselves.  That front office was on point that draft night.  Hopefully in the future, Luka Doncic &amp; Jalen Brunson are the answer to this same question :)"
Jalen Brunson with league average height would be a perennial All Star
"PG - Luka SG - THJ SF - Reggie Bullock PF - DFS C- KP  Bench:  Guards: Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke  Wings: Sterling Brown, Josh Green  Bigs: Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Boban, Moses Brown"
Doesn’t Jalen Brunson usually play when Luka isn’t in the game?
Jalen Brunson at almost 80% really surprised me
"""pass first facilitator""   is jalen brunson a point guard? because he's not pass first either   what about damian lillard..."
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There’s a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
"Jalen Brunson, but seems like I'm in the minority."
"Jalen ""John Legend"" Brunson"
"1 Jalen Brunson, pls"
"because Bogdanovic and Huerter can handle the ball, pass, and are capable of making decisions. Please tell me what KP, DFS, Kleber, THJ, Powell, WCS, Boban can do in terms of handling the ball, passing, and making decisions. With or without Luka on the roster, not a single one of those players has averaged 3 assists per game. In Fact, Hardaway the only who has averaged 2.   Jalen Brunson is the only player besides Luka on this roster who is capable of running the offense any bit. And crazily enough, when Brunson is on the floor, Luka does come off the ball."
Jalen Brunson looks like him too
"The Mavs have consistently gotten quality production out of frankly, some kinda random players. Like no hate on Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber, and Dwight Powell, but they are not the most talented dudes in the league. Despite that, they have played key roles for the team. IMO that's one of the biggest signs of a quality coach, getting the most out of every player.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the Mavs roster outside of Luka look way more dysfunctional this year compared to previous seasons despite very little change in its makeup."
"You're right.  Leon Rose (current Knicks president who used to run CAA's basketball division), was just kind of boys with Rick Brunson (Jalen Brunson's dad) and helped him get his first few NBA deals, used that to help grow a client base and turn CAA into one of the bigger agencies.  That's *similar* to Paul's story, although obviously having 2012 Lebron's connections is better than having Rick Brunson's connections in 1995."
"the fact that his narrative still around after the playoffs, KP looked like a g-league player trying to post up Reggie Jackson and fading away every time and suddenly is Luka's fault lmao, if he could score then he would get the ball more just like Jalen Brunson or THJ, or he could run the bench more but KP can't get a bucket nowadays, specially after his injury in the bubble"
"Jalen Brunson, Fred Van Vleet, Kyle Lowry"
Jalen Brunson
"In our rosters current state, I don’t. It comes down to whether either Porzingis develops anything as a playmaker to where he can do more outside of scoring as a roll man and post player. Or whether Jalen Brunson can become a legitimate backcourt playmaker. Brunson works a lot in the midrange and driving to the hoop. If KP can play off of that I think he can find himself a lot of good looks to keep himself in a good rhythm for shooting.   Part of why I think getting Lowry would have been perfect for us is because I think it would help unlock KP as a player because in its current state, our roster is reliant on one playmaker and we have a bunch of 3 and D guys with nearly 0 ability to put the ball on the floor and find a moving shooter."
"Jalen Brunson got absolutely hammered by two guys during that Mavs- Rockets game, so I think the no calls in that particular game were pretty evenly spread out. But someone is going to get hurt real soon, and if the refs dont tone it down a little, all these small ball lineups are going to get destroyed lol."
"Unpopular opinion, but I don't think Bol Bol is going to make it in the league as a regular rotational player. He has nice highlights but he's not good enough at what he does for an NBA franchise to put the ball in his hands consistently over other starter-quality NBA players. College players who lead the nation in assists or scoring regularly fail to make it in the league, people under estimate how elite you have to be to even be a guy like Jalen Brunson who is a quality back up guard. Just on the Nuggets, are you going to take the ball out of Jokic, MPJ, and Murray's hands to have Bol Bol try to break down his man on the perimeter?"
I mean you have Jalen Brunson who wasn't even picked in the first round and isn't a starter.

Refs owe Jalen Brunson two points
"very low key and more of a role player than others mentioned, but since all the obvious answers have been covered, I'd give a shout-out to Jalen Brunson."
Jalen Brunson was thrown around like a rag doll with no calls the entire game just take the L  For every phantom call there was a no called and-1
Jalen Brunson is playing Rugby
"Curious to see what percentage of the turnover nightmare in the Raps game will be our running average.   Like you say, the talent’s there and the fit’s weird. In fact, I think we’re vastly deeper than last year, but that depth is only effective on defense without motion in the offense. Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith can both ball, now, but both in a way that’s very redundant with Tatum and Brown; Schröder and Richardson are both fine rotation players, but again we’d be infinitely better off if one was prime JJ Barea, or Jalen Brunson.  Good read."
Jalen Brunson gotta know he ain’t that pal 🤣
"He was atop my hypothetical list of 2011 Mavs. He's reportedly going to be working for the Mavs as an advance scout, based out of Miami this year.  Now if Kidd does ""decide to spend more time with his family"", it's likely Igor taking over as interim, and that's fine by me. Honestly, I'd rather Jalen Brunson takes over as coach and 48yo Kidd becomes our backup PG than the current arrangement."
"Just a dumb take. There weren't super teams all around the NBA when LBJ could take the Cavs to the finals every year in a weak East which is about the same time Dwight had his success with the Magic.    Name a team in the East that would be as strong as the Clippers last year with that amount of superstar talent + quality depth.    Instead of a dumb shallow take, understand the difference between Trae with the Hawks &amp; Luka with the Mavs. It's roster building and the opportunities given by losing consistently before &amp; even with Trae. Bunch of high draft picks leads to Hunter, Reddish, Collins, etc and smart roster additions like Capella.    With Luka, the Mavs don't lose enough to get those picks and obviously lost the ability to collect more young assets with high ceilings by trading away picks for KP &amp; the pick for Luka. So while the Hawks roster is only getting better by the development of young, highly talented guys, the Mavs' most promising young talent that looks to continue to grow is ... Jalen Brunson, a 2nd rounder back up guard."
"I mean sure but they have him, Jalen Brunson, and then a bunch of dudes who don’t handle the ball. No one can create for themselves and it’s a huge roster issue  The Hawks roster in comparison is way different. They don’t need Trae to create for every single player on the roster. Pretty much their entire team can go get a bucket. Most players on the Mavs roster can’t"
Didn't look it last night when DeAndre Hunter put him in jail lol. Jalen Brunson looked like the Mavs best player
I was unhappy with his hiring. He showed little skill as a coach in Milwaukee and our squad are not good enough to hide bad coaching. His sound bites have been about creating an egalitarian offense when only Luka and Jalen Brunson to an extent can create offense. That is madness in my eyes.
"Porzingis was more involved tho, I think that’s a good sign. He started off pretty good, and then as the whole team crumbled down he started playing bad too. I personally didn’t like how Kidd handled the whole game but I’m pretty positive that the team will eventually improve.    The one positive thing about this first game is that Jalen Brunson is great off the bench."
"love it when the NBA is back! Look forward to watching you guys play too. I'm not a fan of Kidd, and don't think he will do particularly well, but Luka will continue to be great, I'm sure, and I like how Jalen Brunson plays the game too"
"That doesnt justify KP, a 7’3 Center with a 7’5 wingspan, grabbing only 2 defensive boards. If his purpose isn’t rebounding then he should focus more on contributing by scoring right? Nope, he had the same number of shots as Jalen Brunson and only 1 more than Finney-Smith. So if KP isn’t taking a good chunk of the team’s offensive load, isn’t gonna secure defensive rebounds, and can’t defend a 1 on 1 in the post, what’s his purpose on the floor if his shot isn’t falling? How is he helping Luka?"
JALEN BRUNSON KEEPS DOING THESE FOULS. I THOUGHT THEY CHANGED THE RULES
Jalen Brunson is an old-looking 25-year-old
"That seems like a meaningless distinction to make, though, and it completely ignores that the point of having young players is to accrue stars, not role players.   The group of Luka, Moses brown, Tyrell Terry, Jalen brunson, Frank and Josh green is likely to see way more success over the next 5 years than the OKC group.   The OKC group is only a better core if your goal is to have a bunch of good players and turn into the Pacers and be a fun team to watch with 0 playoff equity."
"They got Jalen Brunson in the 2nd round and Maxi Kleber and Finney-Smith were undrafted. Considering they’ve had few 1st round picks outside of the one they drafted Doncic with, this is a very weird narrative."
Nah fam  MVP: Luka  DPOY: KP  MIP: Josh Green  ROY: Eugene Omoruyi  6MOY: Jalen Brunson  COTY: Jason Kidd
"MVP: James Harden   DPOY: ~~Ben Simmons~~ Draymond Green   ROY: Cade Cunningham   6MOY: Jalen Brunson   MIP: Michael Porter Jr.   COY: Jason Kidd  One homer take, and one spicy take involving the Mavs. I said what I said."
"1 to both Maxi and Dodo, and 6'5 Jalen Brunson  but if i can switch few for wingspan, Maxi with 7'2 wingspan instead of 6'11 will be 15million guy"
"“Of everyone on Dallas….open shot….fate of the free world on the line, Nazi’s pointing their rifles right at us….  I want JALEN BRUNSON”"
ROTY: Cade Cunningham  MIP: Devonte Graham  6MOTY: Jalen Brunson  COTY: Eric Spoelstra  DPOTY: Giannis  MVP: Luka
Lol poor Jalen Brunson. Just too small
Jalen Brunson 6MOTY  Lavine MVP. Bulls is last year Jazz offense on steroid with respectable defense. and who cares much about defense in reg.season
Jalen Brunson man
"I mean we need a perimeter defender though so Ntilikina adds a valuable depth piece to randomly plug in at times. With Jalen Brunson, there is a bit less of a need for Trey Burke in the context of our roster."
"Right now, Jalen Brunson. We need playmaking outside of Luka, if Brunson can't provide it, we're fucked."

Resurgence of Tingus Pingus. He can jump again and the burst get better. Hope it translates in season. Also maxi got thinner and place your bet for Jalen Brunson 6MOTY  *pls be healthy my broken unicorn*
Damn what happened with Jae Crowder? What happened with Jalen Brunson?   Maybe most of his rookies weren’t good…
"Jalen Brunson. He was injured in the bubble so Burke was our backup there, that might be where you got that idea from. Brunson's goated, we love him in the mavs subreddit."
"I would never trade KP for Kyrie who might not even play or if he does just leave this summer.  If they want him for Dwight Powell and Jalen Brunson though, let's get it done."
"This isn't an impressive list.   You can't count Bridges. They didn't pick him. They picked him for Phoenix because they wanted Zaire Smith.   Landry Shamet is a fringe rotation player and the very next pick was Robert Williams. Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham and Mitchell Robinson all went within the next 10 picks.   Thybulle is fine for pick 20 but he's not a starter or anything.    Maxey has potential but hasn't really done anything yet. The same can be said for Joe."
"2018, GSW drafted Jacob Evans over Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, and Jalen Brunson.  You can do this with any team just about every year."
"Close call, but Jalen is a year younger, so there is maybe a small chance, that he has more room for improvement. In a year, when Brunson signed his next contract and has probably been in the playoffs for a 2nd time, this will likely be easier to answer."
"Monte Morris averaged 10.5 points, 3.8 assists and 2.2 rebounds in 13 games as a starter in 2020-21.  Jalen Brunson averaged 16.6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 12 games as a starter in 2020-21."
"Jeez. The amount of effort these nephews make me do.  2021 Clips vs Mavs 3P stats  Game 1 - DFS 4/5, THJ 5/9  Game 2 - THJ 6/8, KP 3/4, Maxi Kleber 2/2  Game 3 - THJ 4/6, Maxi 4/7, Jalen Brunson 4/6, Clips still win (lmao)  Game 4 - Mavs only score 81. Luka sucks.  Game 5 - THJ 20 points, Kawhi and PG both suck  Game 6 - THJ 23 points, Monstrous Kawhi performance takes Clips home  Game 7 - THJ 4/7, Mavs still suck."
"If we are talking realistic options, then   I'd give you Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney smith, and 3 first.   Honestly. Ben Simmons and Luka don't fit well if Ben Simmons wants to keep the ball in his hands."
"So I'm assuming this includes all the way back to 99  Josh howard Devin Harris JJ barea Jalen brunson Dorian Finney smith Jae crowder   Dallas did fuck up big time though and really messed up. Especially in 2013. We had the 13th pick. Traded down to 16th to save money (missed out on Giannis) then traded down again to save more money (missed out on Schroeder) and ended up drafting Shane fucking Larkin at 18th (missing out on gobert)  And before you say we didn't scout those guys, we wanted Giannis and ended up going a different direction bc Cuban. Shroeder was being talked about in local media. And gobert was being touted as a sleeper pick by several Mavs centric outlets."
They got a steal in Jalen Brunson in the second round
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."

"I replied to another comment about the midrange thing: https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/q2wnvi/nba_top_100_player_rankings_for_202122_kevin/hfomd07/  As to the playmaking thing, Luka pretty obviously does a massive amount of playmaking himself. Jalen Brunson was probably the mavs 2nd best shot creator these playoffs. I also don't really follow the logic of ""he had no help therefore he was a better playmaker""."
The age gap between Jalen Brunson (25yo - 2018 class) and Kristaps Porzingis (26yo - 2015 class) is smaller than the age gap between Jalen Brunson and Luka Doncic (22yo - 2018 class)
Jalen Brunson is embarrassing the NCAA
Jalen Brunson graduated with a masters in 3 years with a very high GPA.
Jalen Brunson
From Chicago   Played Vs Max Strus and Jalen Brunson   Saw Jabari Parker/Jahlil Okafor sectional games @ my school every year   Almost Played Cliff Alexander in Playoffs but his team was using Ineligible Players lol  And my brother got Dunked on By Iman Shumpert
"Honest guess;  Kevin Knox, Obi Toppin, Jalen Brunson, Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons"
Jalen Brunson burner for the win!
Jalen Brunson. Always poised and collected
So you're saying... he was the best player so he took all the possessions but he was willing to play more with the team and not be the focal point. Seems questionable.   Jalen Brunson is a good back-up pg
"THJ is a guy that can iso and can do it amazingly. KP did a decent amount of dribbling as a Knicks big.   JRich isn't great at creating his own shot but the role the Mavs have put him in as a catch and shoot player hasn't made him more efficient.   If you don't think Jalen Brunson is a good second ball handler, I'm pretty sure 29 other teams will take him."
"I live in Fort Worth, so I've seen a few of their games.   Jalen Brunson is a very good point guard, maybe even starter level. THJ is one of the best iso players in the league right now.   When exactly did the Mavs try to make Luka play off ball? Point out the games.   Luka is clearly the best ball handler but he's the focal point of the offense that leaves the rest of the players nearly uninvolved with the offense. But look at his usage. Is he clearly a better ball handler than Dame? Kyrie? LeBron? Steph? Maybe there's a reason all of these great players that are better scorers than Luka have a lower usage percentage.   Luka has a 36% usage rate and a 44% assist rate. That means he basically uses 80/100 possessions whenever he's on the floor"
"There are lots of little guys in the league right now doing good stuff. Jalen Brunson, Ish Smith, Chris Chiozza are all solid guards in the league right now.   J.J. Barea and Isaiah Thomas were also huge for their team's success when they played."
Jalen Brunson
You could have a deep team if you chose Jalen   - Jalen Rose - Jalen Green - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Johnson - Jalen Suggs - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith  Funnily enough a lot of them are really young
"I think any random top 25 team is off.  And maybe not even the best teams some years could pull it off.  But I do believe some of the best college teams in history can definitely pull off some wins given 82 tries.  2018 Villanova I think has a shot.  They had Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divencenzo, Omari Spellman and Eric Pashcall who all made the NBA.  Phil Booth was in the G-League and Colin Gillespie was an all-American who will probably make the G-League or a European League after he 'graduates' next year.  Jermain Samuels might also go pro after he graduates next year as well.  That roster has 5 NBA players and 8 pros.  They were really good.  &amp;#x200B;  The 2010 Kentucky team was also really stacked.  They didn't win the title, but had John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, Daniel Orton, Patrick Patterson, Deandre Liggins and Darius Miller.  7 NBA players.  There are also a couple UNC and Duke rosters as well as Michigan's Fab Five.  Some of these teams I think can do much better than 1 win too.  Wouldn't be surpised if that Kentucky team could get at least 5."
"Maybe Jalen Brunson would be ""the worst""."
"Brandon Roy is someone I mention because he went 6th, ahead of All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge, ahead of multiple high upside busts. But Roy was viewed, at the time anyway, as a can't miss starting quality player. He exceeded that obviously.  Very similar to what people were saying about Buddy Hield coming out of the draft. Who coincidentally also went 6th.  It's worth mentioning that NCAA player of the year winners have often amounted to very little, or sometimes nothing, in the NBA. Winners have included Tyler Hansbrough, Obi Toppin, Frank Mason, Frank Kaminsky, Jalen Brunson, etc. Lots and lots of guys that had zero business going 1st overall or even all that close to it.    Reddish has great shooting form and I always saw it as more of a decision making problem personally. I think he's going to figure it out and shoot a solid at least 34% eventually. He shoots over 80% from the FT line there's no way his 3 point percentage doesn't improve eventually."
"Cool video I found on youtube about Dallas Jalen Brunson, shows how he creates space and gets his buckets. All credit goes to the owner of the video and his youtube channel."
What if we also got Jalen Brunson?
"Jones is the best back-up point guard in the league?   That's a bold statement!  A lot of great back-up point guards putting up better numbers than 6.3/3.7.  I realize per game averages aren't everything, but T. J. McConell. Derick Rose. Jalen Brunson. Jeff Teague. Rondo.  There are a lot of talented players at the point guard position. I don't think that position has ever been this deep in the history of the game."
"the list over the last five years has Jalen Brunson, Frank Mason, and Luka Garza lol  hardly physical specimens in the league."
Don’t disrespect the 2x ncaa champion Jalen Brunson like that
Yeah seriously. Even knows JB is Jalen Brunson!
"Wait, are you shitting on Jalen Brunson or are you saying it would be absurd for the Mavs to give up Jalen Brunson?"
Come on bro. I'm as low on Simmons as they come. But Jalen Brunson?? 😂😂😂

"I hope more than 15 of them become NBA mainstays just so I could field a team of Jalens on 2k.   A starting five of Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Brown, Jalen Johnson and Jalen McDaniels is easily a playoff contender, albeit a little backcourt-heavy.   Right now tho the bench seems pretty thin with Jalen Brunson as the only sure thing."
"Yeah but so were Tyler Hansborough, Doug McDermott, Jalen Brunson, Jimmer, etc.  No disrespect to those guys, all the first 3 were all able to find some type of roles in the NBA, much more so for Dougie &amp; Jalen, but examples of dominant college players being average NBA guys (not that that’s bad)  Garza’s weight loss I think also makes him a different type of player/prospect that media guys weren’t expecting"
"There’s a Jaylen Adam’s on the bulls and a Jalen Adams on the raptors.

"&gt;First, the low-volume-but-extremely-efficient group: LeBron James (yep), Kevin Durant (yep), Jalen Brunson (?)  You wouldn't have the ""?"" next to Brunson if you'd read my post history. I've been preaching that gospel for a while now."
TIL Jalen Brunson is close to Lebron on scoring from driving.
Jalen Brunson has a case for 2018
Yeah but Luka played PG since like Dec of his rookie year and not anything else since. He’s an over sized PG sure but even when another PG plays with him they play SG like Jalen Brunson
He shoulda put jalen brunson instead of Tyler herro
Jalen Brunson putting on bubble wrap as we speak
"* I could see Malik Beasley hit 25ppg with everyone on the Wolves healthy.  * Derrick White could have had a breakout season last year but couldn't get healthy.   * Jalen Brunson is really good, but maybe we won't see him flourish until he leaves the Mavs.  * Maybe not MIP, but TJ Warren will have another excellent and totally ignored season. 20ppg on 60 TS%.  * Nickeil Alexander Walker will have some massive games, but struggle with consistency.  * If we are allowed sophmores, I think Haliburton and Patrick Williams will have big leaps. Maybe Aaron Nesmith and Devin Vassell."
"That's not true at all. I went and saw Jalen Brunson play in HS twice and he's from even further away than Chicago. I watched Jahlil play at Whitney Young and Jabari at Simeon. Plenty of people from my area did the same. That's a further drive than Chino to Compton.   What does social status have to do with anything? I'm about as far removed from Derrick Rose's high school social status possible, and I still was a huge fan of his while he was at Simeon because of the proximity.   Again, Chino Hills is less than an hour away from Compton on a day with lighter traffic. Lonzo didn't they're from the same block, he said Derozan is a legend back home. Every single basketball fan from Rockford, where I'm from, loves Derrick Rose, AD, D-Wade, even Tyler Ulis because of proximity. Not as much as they stan Fred, but still the point remains. Lonzo didn't say he Derozan is the only legend from the SoCal area. Just that he's a legend."
Let me know when Embiid takes the Clippers to 7 two years in a row with THJ and Jalen Brunson as his second and third options.
"Never happening in a million years, If we get Jalen Brunson for 35 year-old Dragic everyone in the Mavs front office needs to be fired out of a cannon."

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."

JB is Jalen Brunson.
Cause they have Jalen Brunson. Just another example of a guy letting his ego get in the way of his head. Getting JR Smith vibes
"The Mavs led 2-0, started game 3 hot and it was a 7 game series, of course they were 1 good Jalen Brunson replacement away from winning against the Clippers.  Dallas didn't need great 3point shooting to get past the Clippers, they needed another player to drive to the basket with a tight handle, because the LAC had George, Morris and Zubac in the paint.  Luka doesn't need just 3 point shooters to pass to, he hits cutters as well as anybody, except Jokic, in the current NBA. KP would have been amazing for Monta as a floor spacer and I know that, because Ellis actually played with Mummy Dirk.   Regarding the long 2s, I would have gladly taken 40% on open ones against the Clippers, but I assume Ellis would have shot even better, because in contrast to Monta's prime, those shots are now defended a lot less."
"What the hell are you talking about? To trade for anybody with any value you need to give value back.  The Mavs roster is completely devoid of anyone with any real current value besides Luka, DFS, and Jalen Brunson.  No team is going to want to trade an ""underpaid player due a large raise"" for nothing.  None of this has anything to do with Cuban being stingy as an owner. The Mavs have been terrible at drafting for 20 years now, partly because they've had few lottery picks yes but they've also failed to get real value from anything."
"One time I was at dinner in Philly like a week after Villanova won their national championship and at the table right next to us was jalen brunson and donte divencenzo. I leaned over to my dad and whispered that’s who I thought it was, and they must have overheard me because they asked us what we thought of the national championship game the other night and we’re just super friendly."

"As a Knicks fan, I'm jealous of the secure PG situation both the Heat and the Nets have. We love D. Rose but we don't wanna make him play 40 mins a night. I'm still hopeful we get Reggie Jackson, Jalen Brunson or Collin Sexton (for cheap)   Besides that, we're pretty happy with our situation."
Jalen Brunson
"Chris doesn't really do much in terms of these sort of written pieces for the Ringer. The concept for this started because he and KOC were discussing draft philosophies and Vernon, instead of the high upside swings, wanted to focus on guys that have characteristics that would mean they are not busts, especially in terms of ""floor"" and ""character/atitude"". He's not one of their ""scouting guys"", his main area is radio experience (which he still does locally) and being able to lead a show.  So, he's gonna be wrong a lot. But I appreciate that he valued guys like Jalen Brunson (the following year) because I too felt people were way too focused on him not having enough ""upside"" when everything else on the scouting report was really solid and he'd been a positive impact player at every level. He was way better than his draft spot.  Now, does this article look good? I mean, yeah Alkins was gone before I even had to learn his name. But most of these will have a career in the league and a majority of draft classes does not."
Jalen Brunson?
"""worse offensive Jalen Brunson""     WTF LOL"
Damn this is one of the worst takes I’ve ever seen. He wasn’t a superstar but there are like 10-15 of those at a time…he’s 50x TJ or Jalen fucking Brunson (who I like but c’mon)
"Holy shit, TJ McConnell to Manu is the worst fucking comparison I’ve ever heard. They’re literally both just white and known for playing hard and that’s where the comparison ends.  Saying Manu is worse offensively than Jalen Brunson is the second stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. He’s a better scorer, passer, and shooter. The only thing they’re even comparable at is rim finishing. Have you ever actually watched Manu play?"
He's a glorified role player who played in a favorable system with Pop. I would compare him to a guy like TJ McConnell or maybe a worse offensive Jalen Brunson before calling him a star lol
I would like Jalen Brunson :)
Jalen Brunson UFA 🔥🔥
Jalen Brunson was on the Villanova team that one 2 chips recently. Mavs squandered an opportunity to get Saddiq Bey and strengthen the culture in that way. There’s a lot of Villanova alumni in the league rn I’d want on this team. And obviously the strategy they use every year for free agency sets them up to fail
"“Here he is, Jalen Brunson.”  “No, pally. He is Jalen *Bronson*.”"
"What does Jalen Brunson do, Clarkson type role?"
"Kemba is a score first guard. We already have Jalen Brunson as an undersized score first point guard and he’s $34 million cheaper than Kemba without the injury problems.   The Mavs need someone that can actually run an offense and create good shots for other players when Luka is sitting or is being trapped. Without Luka, the rest of the Mavs just start ISO-ing most of the time, and Kemba wouldn’t be much different"
Why would Jalen Brunson guard Luka? What hapaned to Finney-Smith?
lol jalen brunson guarding luka
"You do realize that many 1st year NBA players enter the league at 22 right? Brogdon came in as a rookie at 22, Jalen Brunson (mavs) came in as a rookie at 22 , basically those players who do all 4 of their years in college. 22 is not old...and developing a 22 year old 6'8 guard is worth it as long as he shows signs of improvement each year. 24 is not old either, that's not even prime years."
Jalen Brunson is pretty good
"From my quick research, going back to 1961, the player of the year dropped to the 2nd round twice and it was in consecutive years. Jalen Brunson went 33rd in 2018 and  Frank Mason went 34th in 2017."
"Giddey joins the likes of Simmons, Jonah Bolden, Jalen Brunson and Dante Exum as sons of NBL dudes"
Cole ceiling is Jalen Brunson. Lucky to have him on your second unit and fucked if you’re giving him the keys to your team.
"Except Dorian Finney-Smith has gotten better. He averaged 10 points per game on 61% true shooting. His three point percentage has gone from 31% to 39.4% on 5 attempts per game.   And, Jalen Brunson in his 3rd season got legit 6MotY consideration, he averaged 13/3.4/3.5 on 52/41/80  His true shooting has gone from 55% to 62% in 3 seasons, while increasing his scoring  No, none of those guys will be enticing for a star, but they’ve improved."
What does this mean for Jalen Brunson then? I don't think they can afford to extend him for what he's worth. Someone is gonna throw a fat contract at thim. And I don't blame them. He's an exceptional point guard that could start on most teams.
"JRich has only 1 year (if he picks up his player option), Dwight Powell has 2 more years. Both are making around $10 mil each so not bad contracts, but they’re probably neutral value at best so I’d expect the Mavs to at least add in a pick or a young player or something to make it more fair. Maybe Powell + JRich + Jalen Brunson?"
He might be the last player I want the mavs to sign honestly. I’d rather just keep developing jalen Brunson
"McBuckets was a big star in college at least, being a 3x 1st team All-American and consensus Player of the Year as a senior. It's not any weirder to run into a McDermott fan than it would be to run into say, a fan of Jimmer Fredette, Jay Williams, Trey Burke, Jalen Brunson, Frank Kaminsky or Nick Collison - all great college players with underwhelming NBA careers.   Drummond, OTOH, fouled out of his only NCAA tournament game with 2 whole points in 26 minutes."
"Giannis would lose in the first round with the roster Luka has.  He or Jalen Brunson would be the team’s best ball handler, Giannis ain’t going nowhere with Brunson as his PG get fucking real.  We have nobody on our roster even at Jrue’s level, let alone Khris Middleton. And our roster construction would limit Giannis even more than it’s limiting Luka. Better players are not always “better” dependent upon situation."
"Lakers fans, interested in any of:  Jalen Brunson  Josh Richardson  Dwight Powell  Trey Burke  ?"
Cameron Payne or Jalen Brunson are in the discussion. But Morris is damn good.
"If Jalen Brunson keeps progressing, he’ll have a shot at best backup PG in the league."
"Jalen Brunson, obviously other than Boban as you said."
Clearly Jeff Teague and jalen Brunson in a 3 team deal
"MVP: Tatum, MIP: Mikal Bridges, ROTY: Jalen Green, COTY: Ty Lue, 6MOTY: Brunson, NBA Champ: Nets in 6 verses Suns"
Hopefully Jason Kidd will play him and Luka together more often than Rick Carlisle did. Would definitely help out Luka to stay fit in the 4th quarter and Jalen can give you good production in his minutes.  Brunson gives me a lot of vibes of Patty Mills or some other backup PG  that stays in the NBA for long time. I like his game.
Jalen Brunson with more minutes on another team
"Okay you coach the Mavs. Tell me what option our roster has. You want Tim Hardaway Jr to initiate the offense? You want Maxi Keleber/DFS/Powell dribbling the ball around?  When Jalen Brunson is in the game, you will see Luka go in the post more, play off ball more. Run handoffs with the bigs. Hes not a good off ball player, but he gives the ball away. But outside of Brunson, nobody can even dribble in traffic."
"KP has been playing great. Jalen Brunson has been playing great. That's it.  Just admit you've watched one of our games and move on, dummy"
"It is almost solely Jalen Brunson. Dude has been a tear this season. Crazy consistent and really efficient play from him has likely contributed to more wins than any other player (not counting Luka). Our starters play some horrible basketball and really struggle to score and protect the paint. Then JB comes in and torches their second unit. If the opposing team has depth it doesn't work as well.   Our starters outside of Luka and KP have been consistently shit to start the year. If it weren't for Brunson being a flamethrower and some quality Kleber play, we'd lose a lot more games."
I'm not sure either but Jalen Brunson has been hitting the top 5 of 538 Raptor's +/- metric and I was wondering what the fuck is going on.
Jalen Brunson lmao good effort
"**A Sock-Off.**  A competition to see which player can fit the highest amount of calf-length socks on his feet at one time.  I'm interested in the strategy, and which types of players would excel in this field. Do you want to be tall or short? Built, fat, or thin? I don't know. Maybe Tacko Fall slays the competition? Or would it be Jalen Brunson? Who is to say?"
"He gets paired with the worst lineups, namely Dwight Powell, because no one else outside of Jalen Brunson can create a shot. And even with him those lineups are terrible.  He also has played worse than last year."
"Luka's still a top-5 talent, but he's been having a slow, inconsistent start of the season.  The reason the Mavs are really relevant has more to do with Jalen Brunson.  Easy 6th man."
"Apart from last season, the Mavs second unit has killed teams on offense. Two seasons ago when they had the best offense (at the time) in NBA history, they were better on O with Doncic off. Jalen Brunson is a really good regular season player."
"Willie Cauley Stein became our starting center... He was cut by the 20 win Warriors. Our center rotation is legitmately one of the worst I have ever seen.   Houston and Orlando can barely win games but they still have Wendell Carter, Mo Bamba or Christian Wood, Sengun, and Daniel Theis, all who are infinitely infinitely better than Powell, WCS, and Moses Brown. Boban is effective in very specific situations that come about like once every 10 games.   That being said, I think Dorian Finney-Smith definitely gets minutes off the bench for the Suns and Jalen Brunson is one of the best backup point guards in the league. Issue is Brunson is straight up our number 3 option and third best player and Finney Smith is our main perimeter and wing defender, and honestly one our more important shooters with how bad Hardaway/Bullock have been.   Hardaway and Bullock need to get it going so our shooting can at least start to cover deficiencies some games. I think both are capable of being very solid players as we saw from both of them last season."
"yeah but I've been watching a lot of their games, often what happens is their starters get blasted off the floor in a lopsided first and third quarter and then the bench comes and cuts into that huge deficit against opposing benches.  like those san antonio games where they clawed back into it after their starters got played off the floor  it's happened enough times this season to have a significant effect on his +/-  in their game against boston that luka won on a buzzer beater he was +10 and led the mavericks in that stat  jalen brunson isn't a better player than luka even though his +/- and on/off are much better.    there is some criticism you can levy on luka though, when his team is getting blasted by 20+ points he stops caring on defense and just goes for some stat padding to keep his averages up for allstar/all-nba team purposes.    he'll let people blow by him on the baseline, not even bother closing out on shooters and just get waxed in the pick and roll.    enough of those minutes has a very bad effect on his +/- though his counting stats are good because of it"
"You guys are depending on Tim Hardaway Jr. to be a starter and give you serious scoring production. He's just not that type of player. At best, he's a bench guy that can come in and give you 15 points when you need it. He's also undersized defensively and not a great athlete.   I really liked Finny-Smith coming out of Florida, but his shot mechanics are still bad and he's not going to give you anything on offense. I admire his defensive effort but he's another guy that you're depending too much on.   KP just can't be your 2nd option, or even 1st option when Luka is having an off night.   Jalen Brunson is a great player but he's still undersized and depending on him to pick up scoring slack is also too much.   Powell and Cauley-Stein offer nothing offensively and aren't the hyper-athletic defensive guys that can get out and run that they used to be.   Aside from Luka and sometimes KP, nobody scares me on the perimeter for you guys.  Edit: and yes I think Kidd was a bad hire"
"I'm a long time Mavs fan, Reunion Arena, pre-Cuban, Three Js era (Jamal Mashburn, Jason Kidd (young Jason Kidd), Jim Jackson). I'm not of the belief we haven't tried... but every move we've made has been bad. KP is a better player than he gets credit for, but, of course, is injury prone. Josh Richardson forgot basketball. Bullock has forgotten basketball. Rick, while a great coach, has always been stubborn. And it blew up.  We suck at drafting. Before the Luka/Brunson draft, the last rotation quality player we drafted AND kept was Josh Howard... in 2003. I want Luka to succeed and succeed with us. But this is year four and we seem to only be going backwards. If we put Luka up for trade, we might get one of the most insane halls in NBA history - assuming anyone can actually give us something that could pan out. You'll never win a trade where you give up a superstar, but we've seen recently many teams get some pretty good deals.  I just don't see a way you fix this with Luka and KP on maxes and Jalen about to be a FA. Fellow Mavs fans will hate me saying it, but it is something to really talk about."
Probably Jalen Brunson.
"My response was a rebuttal. Don't know how you got a bizarre emotional take from that, but whatever.  The Bulls record is nice at 13-8, much better than most people thought. I've said it since the offseason, though: the Ball/Caruso backcourt is not going to produce at the level they are being paid. The difference between the two is that Caruso is a clear bench piece, and he excels in that role. Ball is supposed to be a game-changing point guard, but 5 years in, he's still looks lost in the half-court.  I said in the summer this signing is going to hurt the Bulls in the long run, because you've got $20 million annum tied up into a player that's never going to be a $20 million player. This summer, Jalen Brunson (for example) is going to be an UFA, and he is a far superior point guard than Lonzo has ever been. Brunson would be the perfect half-court guy for the Bulls, but the team is currently hard-capped, and Lavine is in line for a huge pay raise, meaning the Bulls have no shot at improving through free agency this summer.  You may not want to hear it, but Lonzo's contract is going to put a hard limit on this team's ceiling. I would be very surprised if he finished this contract in Chicago."
JB. Jalen Brunson. Jack Black is Jables in Tenacious D.
"Jalen Brunson is not better than CJ, CJ would be the consistent 2nd scorer that the Mavs need at all 3 levels, if CJ was on the Mavs last year for the playoffs then they woulda won the series."
what i got is Jalen Brunson &gt; Luka
Not always. Derrick Rose and Jalen Brunson are 9th and 10th in WAR and neither of them are great rebounders.
"also take someone like Luka or jokic. Amazing handles for their size. Literally 99.9th percentile of handles for height. Even lebron. But I’d rather have jalen Brunson bring the ball up against GPII. Because his handles are objectively better and less likely to get pickpocketed. So say Luka always brings the balll up, gets annoyed and tired about Payton, and tells Jalen to bring the ball up. Of course that’s better than not annoying Luka, but does it truly matter? Probably not."
Jalen Brunson will never be a 3rd option on a contending team
It's Jalen Brunson but he got hurt tonight.
Jalen Brunson is only 25????  I don’t know why but I thought he was like a 34 year old vet at the end of his career 😂
Jalen Brunson is going to be running second units at a high level for a loooooong time

Jalen Brunson
"I’ve also watched every Pistons game since Cade came back and every Magic game that didn’t interfere with a Rockets or Pistons game.   Watching the young, horrible teams is pretty fun if you have no emotional investment in their success.   The Mavericks have also been pretty fun to watch the last two games with Luka sidelined. It’s not everyday that you get to watch a team whose two best players are Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porzingis."
"The homer pick would be Jalen Brunson. The guy has been pretty great in spurts, but being Luka's backup makes it hard to shine consistently.   The non-homer pick: can you imagine Malik Beasley on a roster that isn't overloaded with SGs?"
"I'm curious what people think of Jalen Brunson. With Rick I always felt he was the guard whisperer so never really thought highly of decent guard play from Delon Wright, Devin Harris, Burke, monta, ect, but Jalen has just kept getting better and craftier even with the Kidd handicap. I know he's a little undersized but I'd be curious to see what he could do in a D'Antoni Suns Nash system."

Fuck Jalen Brunson! Sick of watching him freeze guys out to go running into the paint to miss a shot or dribble for 20 god damn seconds then pass the ball at the end of the shot clock like a grenade.
And the black hole Jalen Brunson
I love Jalen Brunson
"I mean, he's first in RAPTOR! You know, the stat that rates Jalen Brunson higher than Kevin Durant offensively, and Buddy Hield higher than Draymond Green defensively.  Advanced stats are great, but are only as good as the formulas behind them. Jokic is a great player, Top 5 right now with room to keep getting better, but the advanced stats  thing MIGHT be overplayed a bit right now."
"Nah, Jalen Brunson in 2030-31"

"Dagger 3 by Book to finish it off, and that Jordanesque layup was *chef’s kiss*.  Suns almost back to mid-season form.   Jalen Brunson made some incredibly tough shots under heavy defense and continued to do so throughout the night. Very impressive.   What an entertaining game this was."
"Peep Jalen Brunson at 3rd in offensive RAPTOR. Dude has honestly been our best offensive player so far this year, no shot at Luka. JB has just been automatic."
The answer is that Jalen Brunson is +82 for the season.
"Our starting lineup had a really rough shooting start to the season, and we kept getting bailed out by our bench, specifically Jalen Brunson, our 2nd round pick from the Luka draft. Also, Dwight Powell has no business being a starter in the NBA, and yet...  Not trying to absolve Luka here of any particular blame, he was kinda ass for the first 8 games or so."
"Jalen Brunson is looking like a young Kyle Lowry for us right now. KP the past couple games is looking like an all-star again since he's fully healthy, mobile, and playing well with Luka.  Our role players aren't bad, but we're starting Dwight Powell at C and it's really hurting us most games. We need an upgrade or to do something else there if we can't play KP heavy minutes in that role.  Luka hasn't even been playing that well by his standards of play. But our season to start has also been easy. We're mostly beating worse teams or good teams that are missing players. Hopefully if Luka isn't injured we can prove ourselves in the double matches vs the Suns and Clippers in our next 4 games."
"love me some Jalen Brunson, dude is a baller"
They could've traded their assets for Jalen Brunson who is much better
Jalen Brunson always looks like he's about to cry
"Cole Anthony, Jalen Brunson, Seth Curry, Larry Nance Jr, Claxton, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland are all 2nd generation."
"The problem is not only the need for a playmaker, its the lack of availability of playmakers for cheap. Rubio right now is an asset for the cavs, helping as a veteran and making the young players grow. Brogdon is more expensive than Rubio, even if he is a beter scorer.   Dinwiddie perhaps? He is on 17M, he is good and maybe the Wizards would think about it? The best option would be praying that next summer they can get someone like Jalen Brunson, which, to be honest, would be quite a good option for them (young, not terribly expensive, good with the ball and decent scorer)."
People might hate me. But Jalen Brunson is playing better than Caruso right now.   And he's a true PG.   He would fit perfectly next to a Herro
"I think it's a 3 guard, small ball unit with;  Jalen Brunson Tyler Herro Alex Caruso Cam Reddish Precious Achiuwa (now that he's coming off the bench)   Most of these guys could start on many teams and have shown that. They also play as closers frequently.   As a Spurs fan I had to stop myself from putting Devin Vassell in there for either Brunson or Caruso (although he might play his way in soon at this rate)."
Oh shit Jalen Brunson is here
Jalen Brunson 50pt bomb
"Expect it at this point. Someone who really shouldn't pops off for 20-30 on us. (See Jalen Brunson, Doug McDermott, rookie season Tyler Herro, Jeff Green, Mo Wagner, etc)."
"Joe ingles is literally memed out of control because he’s white  Jalen Brunson and poetl are nowhere near as good as brogdon and probably just as well known, disagree with those  I’m literally a blazers homer and can say definitively CJ is overrated if anything  Tobias Harris is way more respected than brogdon so to say they’re equal only proves the point brogdon is underrated lol"
"Joe Ingles Jalen Brunson CJ McCollum Poetl   Brogdon is a really good player, but he’s more a Tobias Harris than anything: Really good player who isn’t near elite"
"KP won't play the 5, so we have to put in DP. KP also can't post-up for shit, and that's apparently his favorite type of play. Welp. DP sucks in anything other than rolling to the rim, and even then he sometimes makes the wrong call and instead clogs the paint. DFS can't hit the broadside of a barn right now. Bullock hasn't been hitting his shots either. Luka has also been inefficient af.  That's our starting lineup, it's ass.  Our bench has been kicking other teams' benches collective asses and bailing us out in large part thanks to Jalen Brunson, THJ, and Boban."
Jalen brunson is also kinda playing out of his mind.
We just played Jalen Brunson and I already forgot what he looks like.
"fuck any chart that uses pictures of players, bitch you think I know what Jalen Brunson looks like"
Bro Jalen Brunson is not making an all star team lol
"I’m talking about Jalen Brunson running it in that situation, I should’ve specified"
"I didn't like the hire but Jason Kidd is not the reason we have looked bad against good teams. His in game rotations have been fine. And except for the 1st game against atlanta, the game plan has been fine. The problem has been the starting unit and players shooting way below their 3 point percentage compared to last year. Doncic has started the season slow. Finney-Smith has been horrible shooting so far this season. Powell should not be a starter on any team hoping to be a playoff team and until 2 of the last 3 games KP has struggled with his shot. Also we have no good big men depth. Powell is not good, Willie just looks lost, Boban is a situational player, Moses Brown is too raw and Maxi is hurt. The only guys that has not struggled with his shooting is Jalen Brunson and Maxi before getting hurt.  I guess the one complaint I would have about Kidd so far is keeping Powell as the starter, but even then removing him from the starting lineup is not going to fix the other starters' struggles. Like I said I didn't like the hire but he hasn't given me much to complain about. The struggles we have had have been shooting wise. Things would be fine offensively if Luka was himself and players  that usually hit their 3 point shots were hitting them."
Soo you wanna build a team around Jalen Brunson?
Luka is straight up bad this year. Jalen Brunson have been our best player so far this season smh.
Jalen Brunson might be the best player of all time.
How the fuck is Jalen Brunson only 25? Dude looks like a 54 year old who aged poorly
"Im not saying 'this outcome means you need to change the algorithm so that Drose is lower', Im saying the Raptor metric is arbitrary and useless, and  consistently inconsistent. When you have *multiple* players that are out of place, you need a better model. Jalen Brunson and his 15 points per game in 28 minutes is not a top 5 offensive force either. Plenty of examples."
Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson is top 5 RAPTOR so imo it’s a highly accurate stat
Get Jalen Brunson some help!
"On what good team is Jalen Brunson going to get more opportunities than the Mavs? He’s essentially the second option ball handling and with KP injured, scoring as well. When he’s in the game, he’s on ball quite a bit."
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"

Jalen Brunson is so good
Let's all say it right now. Jalen Brunson for 6MOTY
Jalen Brunson is our 2nd best player and it's not close
In what stratosphere is Langford “essentially thybulle” Lmao that’s like saying Jalen Brunson is “essentially Kyle Lowry” hahahahaha
Jalen Brunson.
I was hyping Cole up last season and some guy told me his ceiling was jalen Brunson
My man Jalen Brunson if he keeps it up.
Jalen Brunson
"Embiid for sure deserved a spot, but KP was incredible last night, that rebound and putback were just as important as Luka's dagger. If anything more important. If Luka misses we go to OT, if KP doesn't get that putback, we are down 2 and the Celtics have the ball and the momentum with about one minute left.   What they didn't show before that was Porziņģis getting the offensive rebound, kicking it out to Jalen Brunson for 3, then grabbing the offensive rebound/put back dunk. It tied the game for us with 90 seconds left. The very next posession KP blocked Schröder's layup attempt and grabbed the rebound and then Luka would then hit the gamewinner on our next full possession."
"I said elsewhere, I don’t like seeing us blow leads, but this was less of a meltdown by us and more of the Celtics trying to chip away and come back. We outscored them by 17 in the first half, they outscored us by 14 in the second half  The good news is this looked like our best team win, and Luka and KP’s best game. Even Jalen who didn’t have a great game still hit his season averages last year. I really think after a couple summers in a row of flubbing free agency we very well might get bailed out by Brunson turning into some version of Kemba Walker/Kyle Lowry. He’s averaging 15/5/4 on 28 minutes a game this year. I say start him and have our lineup be Jalen/Luka/Bullock/DFS/KP  With THJ/Maxi/Brown off the bench, but stagger Luka and Jalen so they’re limited together, Jalen plays well with the 2nd unit. I’m not an NBA coach, but similar to Manu when he was a top 25 player in the league but not starting, but still playing 30 minutes. I think if we could Just always have Luka or Jalen on the floor at all times we’re a dangerous team."
Jalen Brunson and Luka account for two of those Ws tbh
Don’t sleep on Jalen Brunson.
didn't know mavs have Kevin Mchale aka Jalen Brunson on their team
"Yeah, Jalen Brunson was really cooking you guys in the playoffs, Luka was garbage man."
Jalen Brunson looks nice.
"They should trade for Jalen Brunson.  He's an UFA at the end of the season, and Mavs probably can't keep him. Regardless, I doubt he wants to spend the next 4 years as a spot up shooter for Luka."
"&gt;We’re winning those close games, because the defense looks solid.  And because of Jalen fuckin Brunson"

THIS WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED AS THE JALEN BRUNSON GAME.   Let's not talk about anything else. Let us Mavs fans enjoy something for once.
Jalen Brunson +13  Luka Doncic  -17
"Jalen Brunson getting love, love to see it"
Thank you for respecting Jalen Brunson
"It’s such a deep class too. You got Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, Shake Milton, De’Anthony Melton, Alize Johnson all carving out solid careers or showing flashes as second-round picks. 2018 might just turn out to be one of the best classes ever tbh."
Jalen Brunson is gonna get paid this off-season too
"That was a loaded draft: Sexton, SGA, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges  And then Jevon Carter, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham ALL in the 2nd round"
"&gt; The 2018 draft just keeps on looking better and better. It was STACKED! Ayton, trae, luka, SGA, mikal and miles bridges, MPJ, JJJ, Sexton, jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, Gary Trent jr, even donte divencenzo and **Grayson Allen**."

"Sheeesh we about to sign and trade him for jalen Brunson, that’s a dub"
You obviously didn't watch the game and just looked at boxscore. He started going to basket to make it look respectable. But he was even exposed on defense Jalen Brunson was cooking him at end of game
if jalen brunson got the calls floppy joe gets he'd be the best player in the world
Nope. Jalen Brunson said during an interview that when Luka is introduced at 6’7 he always yells that he’s 6’8 lol
So if the mavs are following the 2011 timeline:  beat the clips with kawhi and pg  then beat the jazz with gobert and co  beat the defending champion lakers in the WCF and finally the super team big three nets with KD getting defended by Jalen Brunson
"The best-case scenario of a double team, Kawhi+PG, already happened, and all it did was having to foul KP (I think it was Batum or Morris) or Jalen Brunson getting inside.  And that's already with someone like Rondo in the court too, so it's not like their other guard wasn't known for defense."
"Jalen Brunson and Tim Hardaway were great tonight. And despite the poster, Kleber was solid on defense too. They just need to get Luka a better second option than Tingis."
Jalen Brunson is so fucking good
Jalen Brunson is a complete STUD
Jalen Brunson was born for the playoffs

Jalen Brunson to the rescue

jalen brunson is a better player than kristap porzingis
Everyone needs a Jalen Brunson on their team
Any team would be lucky to have Jalen Brunson. Super solid role player
Jalen Brunson is pretty lit. One of few times i see him play and im sold.
"Jalen ""Charles"" Brunson"
"Also, ""high quality"" is a relative term. Melo is *not* a high quality starting player. But he's essentially co-6th/7th man with Kanter. So, he plays like a 	Monte Morris or Jalen Brunson level role. Compared to teams like the Jazz he doesn't compare, but compared to most teams 7th men he's solidly ""quality"". I should also add that he has a positive VORP and his highest TS% since 2016. He shoots us out of games sometimes but overall he helps us win."
Jalen Brunson IMO how’d a guy like him end up in the second round?
"Same with Kobe, klay, Cole Anthony, bol bol, jalen Brunson, nic claxton,Jae crowder, Ed Davis, garland, jeremi grant, Tim Hardaway Jr, al horford, Luke kornet, Wes Mathews, jabari Parker, Kenyon Martin jr, Austen rivers, Sabonis, Gary Trent jr, Wiggins, Winslow etc etc etc etc etc etc etc   LOTS of guys have nba dads, not many are this good. Damn so hateful"
Jalen Brunson
Jordan Poole or Jalen Brunson
Jalen Brunson
"Dallas also has Jalen Brunson, Dwight Powell and KP all healthy this time around."
1. Luka   2. KP   3. Jalen Brunson   4. Tim Hardaway Jr.   5. Dorian Finney-Smith   6. Maxi Kleber   7. Dwight Powell  8. Josh Green
"He’s definitely no Miami Jrich but he’s fine. As long as he’s not detrimental to the team, he’ll be more than fine. Look I rate Ty Lue higher than most NBA fans and y’all indeed have the edge. However, Mavs are much better than last year simply due to more experience and Jalen Brunson."
"Clippers fans don't realize how many important Mavs role players were missing in that series.  No Jalen Brunson, Dwight Powell or Willie Cauley Stein. KP missed half the series and Luka hurt his ankle in game 3.  That's like Kawhi turning his ankle, PG going down mid series, no Lou Will, No Zubac, no Trez for any game."
"Mavs may not have any other star players, but Jalen Brunson, Timmy, DFS, and J Rich (occasionally) are all capable of dropping 20-25 in a game. May not seem impressive, but the Mavs and Luka are very good at finding the open man. There are no outstanding threats, but each one of the aforementioned plus Maxi and Dwight are gonna get 10-15 and you are looking at a team that can really score the ball"
"&gt;I have always tried to remain at least semi-realistic with positions as long as the league is using positional designations. Embiid is a pure center. Doncic is more amorphous. He acts as the Mavs' point guard, which is why most voters start by considering him at guard; but by that logic, James -- listed at forward most of his career -- has been a ""guard"" all along. (The league made James eligible at guard last season, and again this time.)  &gt;Seven of the Mavs' eight most-used lineups featuring Doncic match him with two of Tim Hardaway Jr., Josh Richardson, and Jalen Brunson. What position is Doncic in those groups? On offense, Doncic is at least as much ""point forward"" as ""point guard."" He defends both guards and forwards -- whatever is convenient night-to-night."
I just think he's going to be an amazing 2nd unit Point Guard at this point like Monte Morris or Jalen Brunson
Isnt jalen Brunson close?

jalen motherfucking brunson. put some damn RESPECT on this man’s name
Jalen fucking Brunson.
JALEN BRUNSON!!!!!!
Jalen BIG HEAD Brunson
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
"Jalen Brunson is a real deal. I feel like his best role is as a 6th man tho, and the Mavs need an actual playmaking PG next to Luka in the starting lineup."
Well Jalen Brunson showed up tonight
Uhhh Jalen Brunson
I hope Jalen Brunson steals the ball at midcourt and dunks on a breakaway and Kevin Harlan calls it a Brunson burner
Jalen Brunson is closer to Herro than Herro is to Luka &amp; Trae
Mavs playbook  1. Luka do something  2. Jalen Brunson do something   3. idgdjeuxhroxyejxhneufheidhd  4. ?  5. Freestyle  6. KP halfcourt 3  7. ?  8. 1 or 2 again
We don't really have anything to trade. Jalen Brunson is our only real asset.
"The 6th man of the year battle feels like it is going to be between Jalen Brunson and Herro, with Herro leading right now."
Yeah I’m pretty sure the one hand scoop allows for more  separation. Jalen Brunson most efficient shot is probably the one handed scoop drive.
"As typical NBA undervalues players that would make great role players. Same thing with Jalen Brunson, skip a solid starter/backup PG prospect for some kid that has no skills but is “raw potential “"
"Luka, Tim Hardaway Jr, Jalen Brunson, Porzingis, and DFS."
"(I believe, from context, he was referring to Jalen Brunson and Maxi Kleber)"
We have two superstars and the rest of our team is trash. Trade everyone and build around Jalen Brunson and Maxi Kleber.
Jalen Brunson &gt; Luka Doncic
