Maybe Chris Boucher next? Go Ducks!
"Warriors yall need a center, how we give you Chris Boucher and 2 of our players let's say TD2 and Matt Thomas for that minny 1st rd pick?"
What did Chris Boucher do to piss off Nick Nurse so much?
My friend calls me Tre Boucher during pick up as in Chris Boucher‚Äôs brother
"Watch low BBIQ Chris Boucher first lose his man due to a horrendous attempt at help defense, and then ball-watches rather than rotate to the corner for a possible outlet pass there as Pascal was already at the paint to help out vs Vucevic."
Pleasant: Chris Boucher/Stanley Johnson/Yuta Watanabe - only mentioning one would be a disservice to the rest  Unpleasant: Terence Davis
Chris Boucher
*Chris Boucher
Jokic and Chris Boucher?
"&gt;Chris Boucher is one, Vanvleet is another, lis  Yep, this guy is just as good as VanVleet and Boucher"
"This is excellent. He'll re-find his love for the game. His confidence is rotting watching younger players usurp his minutes with less talent. He knows it's about the work now. He's learned professional lessons. He took it too personally when Luka stole his team away as a doughy white guy. Then got boo'd by new york's own fans on home court after the trade. He's gonna be back - look at Trey Burke, Chris Boucher, Norm Powell, Van Vleet, Keldon Johnson, Christian Wood. Jerami Grant. at least 40% of the NBA is situation &amp; time."
The Raptors should seriously consider signing him as a backup big.  Jordan Bell and Chris Boucher formed one of the more dominant front courts in recent NCAA history as their games complement each other so well.  If Boucher hadn‚Äôt gotten hurt that Oregon team would have been the NCAA champs that year.  As a 2nd unit they could provide that complementary game again.  Also the Raptors desperately need another big.
"that it's not notable is the point, in some way. This guy went undrafted, got picked up by Grizzlies but didn't get a second contract. Somehow ended up on the Raptors and now looks like a regular bench player.  we get excited for all our G-League or undrafted players. Chris Boucher is one, Vanvleet is another, list goes on.  He's not getting any special treatment because he's asian; Watanabe rides the pine a lot (as did JLin when we picked him up).   It's like picking up $10 somebody dropped by accident but it's yours now. It's only $10, but it's $10 more than you had."
Chris Boucher all star over Lebron James üíØüíØ
 Sorry I‚Äôm bearish on Chris Boucher. He‚Äôs been around a while and is just now putting up some decent production with more minutes on a bad team. His early season three point % screams unsustainable. Just feels like a random guy with a hot start who gets hyped by his team‚Äôs fanbase because he‚Äôs a Canadian playing on the one Canadian team.
"&gt;""Haha get it Detroit bad and dirty jokes haha get it everyone laugh""  &gt;Lives in an igloo  &gt;Circlejerk takes like ""Wiggins bad Westbrook bad Chris Boucher good""  &gt;Tries to act like a basketball genius  &gt;obsessed over another man's post history without looking at context  If you're too lazy to check then that's your problem igloo boy"
"&gt;  ACL is still a big deal mentally  Sure, but the focus of my comment was on athleticism.    &gt;  Don't let the likes of Durant spoil you.  ..Durant tore his achilles, not his ACl.  Athletes don't have the track of recovering from achilles like they do ACLs.  Gallinari, Jefferson, Lavine, Porzignis, Boucher, all those guys either got back to their old level or even got better afterwards. Or you could look at the NFL and AP, Gronk, Bridgewater, Watt, Jason Kelce, Chris Harris Jr, Jeremy Maclin, Wes Welker, list goes on and on.  ACL tears aren't what they once were   [Over 90% of athletes are expected to return to their pre-injury level nowadays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469040/)"
That's why I've always stanned for my boy Chris Boucher. BONJOOUUUURRRR!
Chris Boucher is more important to his team
Is there a reason why Chris Boucher doesn't start over Baynes?
Who is Chris Boucher lol
My guy Chris Boucher bout to have dinner wheneverthefuck we play them
"He‚Äôs good, but he‚Äôs no Chris Boucher"
I watched Chris Boucher do that in a G- League playoff game even crazier at NBA level
You can't compare Jeff Teague to a player like Chris Boucher. That's disrespectful to the GOAT
"that's too bad. i hope you guys can make some moves to fill out your frontcourt depth. i still think siakam is an underrated beast and i really think chris boucher is going to be an all-star. also, your backcourt with fvv and lowry is really good still.  forgot to mention that nurse is easily one of the top coaches in the nba imo."
That team would be much better if you just benched Ben Simmons for Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher!
"Myles Turner isn't the ideal stretch big, although Brook Lopez does fit the bill or Ibaka, Chris Boucher, PJ Washington.   Reaches would be John Collins and Wiseman, who surprisingly has range."
"Marc Gasol, Chris Boucher"
Chris Boucher
And Chris Boucher is 6'9 and 3rd in the league in blocks.
"sorry, it is chris boucher"
chris boucher scares me
Chris Boucher is the third best Canadian this season
* Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Jamal Murray  * Chris boucher  * Dort  * Dillion brooks  * Brendan Clarke  * SGA * RJ * Olynik  * Tristan Thompson * Wiggins    Canadians have the talent to become a pretty strong player in the world basketball stage.
*Chris Boucher has blocked this comment*
Ay stop the cap Chris Boucher having a breakout season!
"Hey man, great post. Here are the best current Canadian players by province (unfortunately this only covers 4 provinces):  Ontario: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 21.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 6.2 APG, 50.5 FG% (Honorable mention : Jamaal Murray)  Quebec: Chris Boucher 16.1 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 2.5 BPG, 72.9 True Shooting % (Honorable mention : Lu Dort)   British Columbia: Brandon Clarke 13.2 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG  Saskatchewan: Trey Lyles  7.3 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 1.1 APG (Has only played 7 games so far so the above numbers are his career averages)"
"Brandon Clarke is a great help defender, Chris Boucher is a great shot blocker, Cory Joseph is a great perimeter defender, Thompson gives effort, I think defense is actually their strength"
"Chris Boucher.  Lu Dort offense  I already knew Jerami Grant, Christian Wood and Wiggins would be this good tbh."
"Chris Boucher is also make a good case for it.  Interestingly enough, they are from the same neighbourhood."
"MIP? Over Christian Wood or Chris Boucher??? Come on now, sir."
"Will be keeping an eye on Dort, Chris Boucher and Shake Milton this season. All three seem to have stepped their game up so well. You love to see it"
Most improved would have to be Bobby (Chris) Boucher.
Either Jerami Grant or Chris Boucher will be MIP but Lu is up there in the conversation.
I swear Lu and Chris Boucher have a bet on who wins MIP this season.
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
Chris Boucher is routinely one of mu favorite players
Chris Boucher signing a 7 million dollar contract this offseason should explain just how surprising his season has been
*Chris Boucher sweating profusely*
Him or fellow French Canadian Chris Boucher.
 Chris Boucher die or something?
Chris Boucher
"Chris Boucher is a better player than some old dude named LaBrone, do you think that we should call up the lakers and see if they'll do him and a first for Boucher?"
 I wish was it Aron Baynes and put Chris boucher at the starting lineup.
"Dude is good. Real good. And I like him. Which is why I hope there aren‚Äôt more post like one from earlier saying stuff like ‚ÄúWho is Better, Christian Wood or Chris Boucher.‚Äù Once people start overrating players it gets annoying and I eventually just stop liking them. Any contender would want him tho"
"This isn‚Äôt even close bro. Just don‚Äôt. No one in their right mind is taking that wood scrub over someone named Boucher. I *gaurantee* Chris would be a better water boy then Christian. In all seriousness, I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could say Boucher. Wood is already clearly better and four years younger. Some people are mentioning the contract situation as if Wood isn‚Äôt on one of the best contracts in the league."
Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher ladies and gentleman
all I know is Chris Boucher would never call me a casual
I smoked a blunt with Chris Boucher at U of O.  I almost tried secretly taking a photo but he was a cool dude so I didn‚Äôt.
Chris Boucher is Cristian Wood's counter part in the east.
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he‚Äôs back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he‚Äôll bounce back soon enough"
Lu Dort and Chris Boucher. Montr√©alais showing out !
"Darius Garland,  Jordan Clarkson,  Jerami Grant,  Christian Wood,  Chris Boucher."
Chris Boucher said ‚Äúfuck a Cade Cunningham‚Äù
"PSYCHO KILLER, CHRIS BOUCHER"
I thought the Raps would turn it around but did not expect the Chris Boucher Is Here tour to be why
Chris Boucher is the cure to my crippling depression
This is a Chris Boucher fan account now
I want to be friends with Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher has 5 20+ point games in his last 6 games. It's nice to see him consistently play well.
Chris Boucher and Kyle Lowry dragging this team through the mud
"Scenerio 1: let‚Äôs say Lowry had agreed to be loaned to the Cavs for 10 days. While playing for the Cavs, he gets a season ending injury. Who is responsible for his salary?  Scenario 2: Chris Boucher is catching up to Turner in blocks, only needs 5 more to pass him. Toronto has already played their full slate of 72 games, but due to the COVID ppd of games, the Wiz have 5 more games left in the season. He gets loaned to the Wizards to get those 5 blks.   Scenario 3: Kawhi Leonard is set to be a free agent. The Raptors see that the clippers‚Äô biggest need is a PG, so they send Lowry for the year. Lowry was actually sent to convince Leonard to come back with him to TOR the following summer, so they can run it back. Kawhi leaves and Ibaka joins them. Do the Clippers have a case for tampering against the Raptors?"
Chris Boucher is up there too
Our C rotation is chris boucher/Yuta Watanabe  Our guards are ballers tho we‚Äôre about to bounce back i think
Chris Boucher is one of the low-volume guys but he's shooting fucking *48%*.
"No you don't. Maybe there is some context to be added, but you don't get a curve lol. If you consistently take bad shots and have a poor percentage you are a bad shooter eventually. There are qualifiers when ranking people. So I don't Chris Boucher would rank unless he got a full season with enough shots to justify."
Wait why is Chris Boucher a god this season
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
Do you understand how much 10 ppg is?  The gap between Beal and Jokic is larger than the gap between Jokic and Chris Boucher.  It‚Äôs not close between the two
Chris Boucher might be in that conversation after the past few weeks.
"Chris Boucher is the frontrunner atm not Clarkson if we are talking about real value, but Clarkson will probably lead in PPG and thus win."
Nikola is actually first in offensive rating and kd is third. Chris Boucher is second tho and he doesn‚Äôt have either players impact so kd is really second.
Chris Boucher
Yes that's because Chris Boucher is the second best player in the league
Chris Boucher ü§ù Kevin Durant  Being disgustingly good 3 point shooters that look like a strong breeze could snap them in half on the court
Yes of course you do lmao. Chris Boucher isn't a better scorer than KD just because he has a higher fg%. The types of shots you take are important and are a big part of who the player is on offence.
Chris Boucher has the highest PER in the league or second highest now
Chris Boucher is a top 5 player according to WS/48
"The trade that would kind of make sense for both sides if Kyrie actually plays for Toronto would be Kyle Lowry and Chris Boucher for Kyrie.  Now that Harden‚Äôs here, Kyle may actually provide much more value than Kyrie for this team with his defensive intensity and leadership. Kyle won‚Äôt pout if he doesn‚Äôt get 10 isos a game like Kyrie.   Chris Boucher on the floor with Lowry, Harden, Harris, and KD would be straight up unfair on offence; with no one being less than at league average 3pt shooter.  Assuming Kyrie‚Äôs ok with playing out his contract in Toronto through 2023 (BIG IF), this gives Toronto a 2 year window to compete with Kyrie as the undisputed star and Pascal as a premium second option.  Who knows, maybe Kyrie now wants to be ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù to lead a team deep in the playoffs averaging 35 points a game."
Chris Boucher
"FREEZE!  This is the Raptors Nickname police. You're in violation of Article 25, Chris Treboucher.

Imagine if we really get beat by Chris  Boucher &amp; Matt Thomas üò≠
"I'll throw out a few names. C. Wood if he comes back and plays like he did pre-injury. Terry Rozier at least in the convo imo. Maybe Julius Randle. Mikal Bridges if defense was valued as much as offense though his offense has also improved. Lonzo because free throws and more threes? Chris Boucher? Trent Jr? Richaun Holmes?

"this is maybe even worse than when DeRozan postered Chris Boucher and when he was getting up off of Chris, he looked at him for like one second and got T'd up. lol here is the dunk and ""staredown"" but they don't show the part where he got a whole ass tech for it.  https://youtu.be/BodyQYNqzPM"
"This. I think people started realizing that getting there quick (and chasing them off or messing up their rhythm) is more effective than getting there chopping your feet in good defensive position, on average.  Only Chris Boucher is really trying to block those 3s. Last time I checked, he‚Äôs leading the league in blocked 3s."
Alright but what about when people say Bonjour or other French stuff when Chris Boucher plays? I don't see anyone ever complaining about that.
"Wait till u start watching the G League. At least in most college ball they'll work around their weaknesses (ie nobody can shoot) with systems, whole G League = the best of those college guys, some of whom can maybe kinda shoot some, maybe, all endlessly chucking bad 3s up bc they want to take the Seth Curry/Chris Boucher dev path"
Jokic/Porzingis/KAT/Chris Boucher/Embiid
"Here's my attempt at a few guys I've seen a lot of:  Kawhi: aaAAUUGGHH  Siakam: AAAIIIIEEEEEE  DeRozan: oouuRAAEEEE  Chris Boucher: HUUA?! (High pitched)  Norman Powell: AYY!  and my personal favourite, Embiid: OO! ... OOO!!!.... OOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! (Very high pitched and progressively higher)"
Chris Boucher leads the Raptors in blocks. Fred is number 2.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not sure if this is good for him or just embarrassing for the rest of the team.
Chris Boucher
"Warriors signed this guy over Chris Boucher. To this day, it haunts me."
"Montrezl Harrell is probably the prime outlier. Christian Wood, Bam Adebayo, and Chris Boucher are also all relatively small among centers."
"I think it‚Äôs overblown.  17 free throw difference.  10 were on intentional fouls.  6 were on Chris Boucher jumping full speed into 3 point shooters.  You guys play a crazy aggressive defense and then get mad about foul calls.  You forced a lot of turnovers at the expense of some free throws, it‚Äôs a trade off."
Chris Boucher has the best form in the NBA when you think about how projectiles actually work.
Man it's so fun watching the best center in the league work.  I of course am talking about Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher is the GOAT CB in raptors history
Our best move in those drafts was signing Chris Boucher after he went undrafted in 2017
"Toronto started to develop Chris Boucher at 24, and he's only now breaking out as a solid player at 28.  Patton might still be able to become something."
"4 current raptors starters (Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, and Chris Boucher) all played for the Raptors 905."
"I love me some Chris Boucher, but i am pretty sure that if Toronto traded him for Gobert, that would be considered the best trade ever."
"I agree with everything until you slandered Chris Boucher. I don't care how correct you are, nobody slanders Chris Boucher"
"This stat has Mike Muscala over Bradley Beal, and Devonte Graham over Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown and KD. Seems like a pretty worthless stat.   Oh it also has Chris Boucher over Rudy Gobert."
"I hate to sound cocky, but the Raptors were 4th in point differential even when they were near the bottom of the standings. Any team that takes this many 3s is going to have high-variance performances, and while FVV is all-star-caliber on his best nights, he's also one of the most inconsistent scorers in the league despite averaging 20 points with great defense.  FVV and Norm emerging as offensive threats also means that teams can't double Siakam as much, lest he kick it out for an easy 3. This is a regression to the mean.  That said... it's fair to say that FVV scoring 13 points in 3 minutes, and Chris Boucher hitting 4 consecutive 3s isn't going to happen every single game."
"Embiid is a fuckin' gorilla. He's like 7 foot, 280, and should not be moving that fucking fluidly at all.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  And you're telling me slim jesus himself aka Chris Boucher stopped this man? You'd imagine Mikey Williams vs Flightreacts when you imagine this on paper."
"When I think of Chris Boucher, I cry.  A team with Payton Pritchard, Jordan Bell, Dillon Brooks, Tyler Dorsey and him would have won the national championship."
It's between Chris Boucher  and  Klay Thompson
Chris Boucher
Chris ‚Äúopposite Shawn Marion‚Äù Boucher
"There‚Äôs gonna be riots in the streets of Toronto when they find out Chris Boucher is older than Andre Drummond, Pascal is older than Wiggins and Julius Randle. There‚Äôs gonna be real carnage when they find out Malachi flynn is the same age as Jayson Tatum"
"They also think every young player on their team is an allstar or mvp. Og Anunoby is Kawhi, pascal is Kawhi, Malachi Flynn is fred VanVleet 2.0 Chris Boucher is a future allstar. They‚Äôre horrible at evaluating their guys"
Better than the ‚ÄúWe The Champs‚Äù or the ‚ÄúChris Boucher MIP AND 6MOTY‚Äù
"FUCK THE LARRY O BRIAN TROPHY, CHANGE THAT SHIT TO THE CHRIS BOUCHER TROPHY"
Chris ‚ÄúTimothy McVeigh‚Äù Boucher
"Chris Boucher, Terence Davis with an insane +32 each"
"You know what I think he is right. It doesn't matter that Joel Embiid has been averaging 30 points over 25 games. Chris Boucher and Baynes ""clamped"" him up today so they must be better right? If I was the 76ers, I would trade Joel and a couple of first round picks for the Better Centers Chris Boucher and Baynes. It's time to break that team up.  &amp;#x200B;  Chris Boucher for MVP"
Not to overreact but Chris Boucher is the MVP favorite right now
Best thing about they game is all the American NBA fans saying WHO THE FUCK IS CHRIS BOUCHER
"It wasn‚Äôt just the defense, it was like Shake and Tobi were having a contest to see how many 3s they could brick lol. Chris Boucher would get the same exact look and splash"
"Chris ""Tre"" Boucher"

"PSYCHO KILLER, CHRIS BOUCHER"
CHRIS BOUCHER! Didn't even need Kyle Lowry to beat a healthy Sixers. Just 18 to 35 free throws attempts too.  Sixers need like Lowry more than the Raps. Is that rumor still alive?
Imagine being Doc Rivers knowing you‚Äôre about to face the Raptors and you don‚Äôt focus your game plan around stopping Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher.
CHRIS BOUCHER AIN'T NO SPOT UP SHOOTER
"PSYCHO KILLER, CHRIS BOUCHER"
have u seen chris boucher
Chris Boucher
"I dont know, what did chris boucher do in the exact same scenario? https://streamable.com/2jljof"
"&gt;Lottery bound just like LeBron his first 2 seasons.  Want to compare their teams?  &gt;And no, he isn't giving up as much as he scores. He has a box +/- of 4.1, which is good for an all star caliber player.  Just ahead of Chris Boucher  &gt;Say it with me: GENERATIONAL TALENT  Say it with me: NOT EVEN THE BEST TALENT OF THE PAST TWO YEARS"
"Durant finals MVP as in, Lowry becomes an top 20 all time player and MVP, VanVleet becomes one of the greatest shooters to ever live, and Chris Boucher become a DPOY who nearly leads the league in assists, with the 3 of them all becoming first ballot hall of famers? Sure, a Siakim Finals MVP in that sense would be similar to Durant‚Äôs"
Chris Boucher nearer than it would seem
"Not one mention of Chris Boucher? Where‚Äôs the love for a guy scoring 14pts, shooting 59% on 2pts, 43% on 3pts, 7 boards and 2 entire blocks per game? Can we have an award that‚Äôs not dictated by points per game and team accomplishments?"
Chris Boucher
"Excuse you, that is Chris Boucherü§ß"
Wolves announcers compare Chris Boucher to originally Keon Clark then Bobby Boucher.
"While that makes sense on paper, it isn't allowed due to some CBA rules  Chris Boucher cannot be traded until March 3rd because he re-signed using Bird rights with a 20% raise in salary and the Raptors are over the cap."
Dominate I guess. Chris Boucher won MVP and G league DPOY and it got him to the NBA.
"&gt;	I‚Äôm not sure which media you‚Äôre watching, but the media absolutely loves LeBron. Honestly seems like you‚Äôre seeing what you want to see.  The irony of this comment is actually pretty hilarious.   Skip, Stephen A, Ric Boucher, Rob Parker, Chris Broussard etc are all super critical of LeBron. That doesn‚Äôt even cover all of them. Combine that with all the fans who‚Äôs daily goal is to hate on LeBron. He got shitted on for sitting at the end of the bench for a game lmao and then Phil jackson had something to say about him as well. Former players are always unreasonably critical of him as well.   Even [Gobert](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2929639-rudy-gobert-lebron-james-is-the-most-criticized-player-of-our-generation.amp.html) chimed in on it. Do you think he is only seeing what he wants to see as well?"
"Chris Boucher was homeless and working as a cook/dish washer at a St Hubert (think Quebec version of  Swiss Chalet, which is a Canadian version of like a Chili's or something but with better food) before getting on an AAU team started to help inner city kids.  But yeah, the majority of NBA players seem to come from middle-upper class"
"I listened to your argument. Your argument was literally listing 3 numbers and saying that Russ was close to Steph's level. I broke down every single major facet of the game and brought stats. How am I the one not willing to listen? Just because you have an argument that I think is bad, it doesn't mean I didn't listen. I once saw an argument on RealGM that Larry Bird was a better 3pt shooter than Steph because of their 3pt shooting contest results. I thought it was stupid, but I listened. Yours wasn't that bad of course but it's pretty pathetic to just throw your hands up because I used the word ""Westbrick"" to argue about his efficiency. It's a very clear way to make my point. If you'd like, I could go over again their true shooting percentages. Would that be a better use of your time? Probably not.   As for after Steph leaves, yeah it'll probably suck, so what? I think the Warriors have a far inferior FO compared to the Raptors, your team will probably be better than mine, none of this ""same level"" bs. So what? What does that have to do with anything? I didn't even insult the Raptors. They're a great organization. They'd never be stupid enough to cut Chris Boucher. I just don't get why that's relevant. We're comparing players. Yes, I'm a Warriors fan. That's not why I think Steph's better than WB. I think he's better because I've watched both of them play for a long time and paid close attention to their numbers over the years. Sue me."
How many blocks does Chris Boucher have Jesus Christ.
"I'm so jealous of how the Raptors can turn late-round picks like Norman Powell and undrafted players like FVV and Chris Boucher into fringe All-Star players. The Celtics are incredibly incompetent at developing players as of late and/or the Celtics are also incredibly bad at picking good prospects. Either way, the Raptors may have one of the best head coach/GM combos in the league while the Celtics are among the worst. Really hate how things turned out because the Celtics had a ton of assets and Brad Stevens/Danny Ainge wasted them all."
"You're right, but I still feel like we've had more impact from guys outplaying their norm than from guys playing below the norm.  Chris Boucher has basically been the most efficient player in the league and shooting like prime Curry from 3, for example. That won't last.  We have a few guys like Bembry and Johnson who are shooting way above the norm on a small sample and a guy like Boucher shooting way above the norm on a medium sample. Combined it makes us 5th in 3pt percentage so far this season, just behind the Nets and just in front of the Nuggets, two offensive juggernauts, while being 3rd in attempts (essentially making us the best 3 point shooting team in the league).  If that keeps up, we're going to be a pretty great offense, but 3pt shooting is fickle and I don't expect us to maintain that efficiency from 3.  Just for reference, here's our differences in 3pt shooting for each of our rotation players from last year to this year (rounded):  Lowry: +3%  FVV: -1%  Pascal: -7%  OG: +4%   Powell: +6%  Davis: +1%  Boucher: +12%  Baynes: -11%  Bembry: +25%  Yuta: +5%  The only guys who are shooting approximately average or below are FVV, Pascal, Davis, and Baynes. The only guys shooting significantly worse than last year are Pascal and Baynes, who have taken 13.5% of our 3 pointers this season. Literally everyone else apart from those 4 on our team is shooting sigificantly higher than they did last year. It's unlikely to last."
"I think he rated just fine all nba caliber/all-star player, my only thing is as the #1 option he need to be more assertive. I think the bigger story is Chris Boucher that boy nice he a starter in this league my Celtics should trade for him"

Well Chris Boucher is Canadian. But fans got used to hearing the national anthem before a game. It hypes them up but really it's not needed. Don't think too many would be care if it was stopped. I mean it serves no purpose. People have just been conditioned to hearing it at the beginning
"Yeah, I mean, it would be nice if Chris Boucher raised his 3pt% by 11.5% (to 43.7%) while almost doubling his attempts (1.9 last year to 3.6 this year) but Im still not fully convinced and need to see it happen for longer."
"remember when Harden grabbed Chris Boucher mid-air and it wasn't called  and then Lowry got hit so hard his face was bleeding and there was no call  and then Norm got hit so hard his face was bleeding and there was no call  ...

"Here's his break down on Boucher:   &gt; I do think Chris Boucher has been the Most Improved Player, and not entirely just because he‚Äôs played 48 games to the 24 of Christian Wood. The Toronto Raptors have been slowly bringing Boucher along for a couple of seasons now, and we‚Äôve seen a vast improvement in everything he‚Äôs doing. He‚Äôs a legitimate Sixth Man for the Raptors. He‚Äôs a defensive presence, especially around the rim. He‚Äôs turned himself into a real threat around the rim, a real 3-point shooter, and someone who has a good in-between game, as well. Boucher has been great for the Raptors, even though their season has been less than. His improvement from last year is tops for me at the moment.  I agree with all that, but he's still not most improved for me. It feels like a lot of guys have taken bigger jumps; I'd give it to Randle, Bridges, or Wood."

Jamaal Murray, Brooks, dort  + Up and coming SGA,Rj barrett, chris Boucher, khem birch, Brandon Clarke, Nickeil Alexander Walker  + veterans like Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Corey Joseph, Dwight Powell,  Hopefully can run for a silver at next international"

I don't *get* Lauri. Is he a wing or a center?   Can he shoot or not? Some nights he looks like he can. And then he can't.  Is he short kristaps?  Is he skinny KAT?  Is he tall Joe Harris?  Is he white Chris Boucher?
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
"Chris Boucher. Pretty sure he was a high school drop out, homeless and working as a dishwasher at 16. He got noticed playing pick up basketball which led to an AAU team which got him back on track to finish high school."
"Fred ""bet on yourself"" Vanvleet, Pascal Siakam, and Chris Boucher all have interesting stories."
Chris Boucher over both of them.  Boucher is averaging 13/6 and 2 BPG on .527/.408/.773 - that‚Äôs .647 TS% and he‚Äôs 4th in the NBA in blocks and 11th in the NBA in WS/48.  He‚Äôs a far better 6th man than either player this season.
He's a rookie. That floor is way too low given his talent and physical abilities. Worst case he will be a better Chris Boucher
"And the icing on this cake? The Warriors signed his college front court mate, one Chris Boucher, as an undrafted free agent. Kept him during his ACL rehab, even played one minute of Warriors basketball back in 2018. Then, they decided to bet on Bell and Alfonso McKinnie instead, and release Boucher.   Chris was a difference maker in this game, is a great stretch front court tweener, and someone the Warriors could desperately use nowadays. Meanwhile, Bell is out of the league, and McKinnie is the 15th man on the Lakers' bench. That stings."
"That's Chris ""I know how to use fertilizer"" Boucher"
"Chris Boucher 1-1 8pts, 4 steals, 3 blocks. This is why advanced stats love him lol."
"Dragic has been injured quite a bit. I'd give shouts to Alec Burks, Chris Boucher, Dario Saric and TJ McConnell"
Chris Boucher should be somewhere on the list
"Siakam, FVV, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis, Norman Powell, these are all legit NBA players that he found in the late 1st, 2nd round or undrafted. Hired Nick Nurse too. He lucked out with Kawhi but he‚Äôs a great team builder"
Love me some Chris Boucher as an Oregon Duck fan but with that said a light breeze would knock him over.
Kyle Lowry   James Harden  Kevin Durant   Chris Boucher  Serge Ibaka  That‚Äôs a championship squad
"When people refer to having G leaguers on their roster they usually mean players that are G league quality. Last year the Warriors actually did that because they didn't have enough real NBA players  I do not think playing a large portion of your career in the G league means that a player is a G leaguer. Afterall there are many players in the league that have played a lot in the G league, so that wouldn't actually tell us anything about the quality of the player. Before this year Chris Boucher played much more in the G league than in the NBA, Duncan Robinson was the same last year"
Chris Boucher is the comparable for me. Blooms late but still improving past the point guys usually peak. Crazy athleticism with low miles for how old they are.

"Chris ""Derrick Jones Jr"" Boucher"
"they're pretty different players. I think Mobley is a hair better, but it's a higher-floor/lower-ceiling kinda thing.  things people might be ignoring with Mobley is that while he's been very solid defensively in college, he's *maybe* 220 lbs with a skinny frame. how much weight/muscle he can develop is an interesting question. if he's more of a taller Chris Boucher defensively, he'll have impact, but he won't be able to take on the bigger guys in the league.  so I have concerns that he's defensively a 4.5 instead of a true center and I don't really believe in his outside shot (I like Wiseman's shot more), which might make them pretty different players ultimately.  Mobley will have a better first season, but I honestly don't know who'll be better in year 4. Wiseman has a longer way to go, but his upside as a true big man might be an advantage."

Chris Boucher is nice but he isn't worth 2 FRPs and those guys.

That‚Äôs a lot of stuff for Chris Boucher. I like Tatum and Brown enough to think they could compete with the right team but this seems like a lot of shuffling for little progress. Smart has been very important to their team and I think people would re-realize that Drummond isn‚Äôt that great.

"&gt;	No, no it doesn‚Äôt.  Yes it does, which models are you comparing it to?  &gt;	Conley had an average of +1,2 DRAP his last two Grizzlies seasons and now is at 5,0. The model is supposed to evaluate players individually, so if Conley‚Äôs defensive value is increased by 300-400% by playing with Rudy Gobert, then the model error makes the model itself worthless.  None of that is average, and that‚Äôs on you for not understanding the context   &gt;	This also doesn‚Äôt explain Lillard being 35 in raptor behind guys like Montrezz Harrel, Joe Harris and Chris Boucher.  Not hard to understand if you don‚Äôt realize that the combination on all the injuries and having Enes Kanter as his center makes Lillard‚Äôs defense look even worse this year. Again, context"
"&gt; Not really, RAPTOR has a lot fewer outliers compared to most models   No, no it doesn't.   &gt; Conley has not been average for his career at all that‚Äôs a pretty casual take. Conley has always been an all-defensive caliber guard and it‚Äôs obvious that his high D-RAPTOR is heavily influenced by sharing the court with gobert a lot. You have to look at context.   The model itself was saying Conley was average, ffs. Stop calling people casual because you can't read.  Conley had an average of +1,2 DRAP his last two Grizzlies seasons and now is at 5,0. The model is supposed to evaluate players individually, so if  Conley's defensive value is increased by 300-400% by playing with Rudy Gobert, then the error model makes the model worthless.   &gt; Rudy and Poetl both play low minutes and mainly play against bench squads.   Poetl has played almost 800 minutes, roughly 200 minutes less than the minutes leader of SAS, and Rudy has played 600. They are the first two guys of the bench. If you are saying the model can't evaluate bench player then that is a different argument. This also doesn't explain Lillard being 35 in raptor behind guys like Montrezz Harrel, Joe Harris and Chris Boucher."
Don't disrespect Chris Boucher and Normal Powell like that. I'm not lying when I say that I would've rather Siakim played than Boucher.

"Chris ""Block Quebecois"" Boucher was born in St Lucia but grew up in Montreal"
"**TEAM CANADA**  After the success of the Toronto Raptors franchise, Canada finally earns a second team again, and unites a cast of all-Canadian players to fill it with their Maple Leaf pride.  Quickly, the team proves to be more than a gimmick. In fact, they fit together well. Lead guards Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander prove to be a good tandem, given Murray's ability to shoot and score and SGA's ability to slash and his size to guard bigger guards. The two both average 20 PPG on the year, nearing All-Star status.  The rest of the team is a mixed bag. Andrew Wiggins has big moments here and there, but Lu Dort appears outmatched for most power forwards given his limited size. Chris Boucher holds his own down low and nears the league -lead for blocks, but has some issues staying out of foul trouble over the course of starters minutes.  Overall, the team flies around .500 all season long, and fights for a playoff spot. Unfortunately, the league stuck them in the Western Conference to split them from Toronto, causing them to barely miss out with a 40-42 total record."
"Hi Duncan!  Happy March!  In 2017 my Oregon Ducks took down your Michigan team in an amazing game that's even more fun to look back on with how many pros each of those teams eras have produced.  Which players do you come across in the league now that you still have memories of big March Madness wins or losses?   P.S. shoutout the swatterboy Chris Boucher who should've been balling out on that run with Pritchard, Bell, Brooks and Dorsey! Love to them all"
Ah yes.  2017 -  Raptors 905 champs 2018- Chris Boucher signs with raptors 905 2019 - Raptors NBA champs.
&gt;lin  I think Chris Boucher already accomplished this.
Last month he went 3/13 and 6/20 from the field in his two games against Toronto and we are being led by fucking Aron Baynes and Chris Boucher. Literally all we did was double him and he couldn't do anything effectively. He only had 2 assists in each game.
We also had Chris Boucher at one point
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"
What do people think about ric Boucher and Chris Broussard?
"Canada could have a good ass team.   Jamal Murray / RJ Barrett / Andrew Wiggins / Dwight Powell / Chris Boucher with Shai, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Trey Lyles, Khem Birch is a hella respectable team."

His peak is probably what Chris Boucher is rn. Boucher probably what people thought Bol Bol could be. Just never turned out for him
"Chris Boucher was a MVP and DPOY and that season he was the end of the bench with the Raptors. It wasn‚Äôt until 2 years later (with an MIP candidate season) until he has a NBA role.  It‚Äôs development league, so clearly players that are good today played games in the league, but when the player in the G-League they weren‚Äôt as good.   It‚Äôs also the Europeague rosters are better 1-10 on the roster, and the teams are more stable and trying to win as opposed to trying to develop players."
"Well if we're going to be Homer's about it, I think it should be Chris Boucher"
"Fuck it let's try this...   PG: Fred VanVleet  SG: Khris Middleton  SF: Bojan Bogdanoviƒá  PF: Christian Wood  C: Nikola Jokic  Bench: Seth Curry, Chris Boucher, Gary Trent Jr, Lu Dort, Yam Madar just for the hell of it."
Chris Boucher
You left out Chris Boucher
"You forgot Chris Boucher, one of the leagues best shot blockers and MiP candidate. He was out too lol"
AND Chris Boucher
"jesus christ and this is with FVV, Gary Trent Jr, OG anunoby, and chris boucher all out for the raptors"
Chris boucher is weird on this list for me aa he's a C/PF.  I don't think of him as a 3&amp;d.  Fred vanvleet doesn't work either for me.    I always think of a 3&amp;d as a wing/oversized gaurd.   Tall enough to gaurd multiple positions but fast enough to lock down a guard. And stretches the floor while not being a ball handler.
Chris Boucher
Would Chris Boucher count?
Ok. Giannis is rich mans Chris Boucher
Off the top of my head I know we didn't have OG the first time we played and we were missing Gary Trent and Chris Boucher tonight.
Chris Boucher or Zion
"Khem Birch (though I think he grew up in Ottawa), Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Karim Man√©. Not bad"
chris boucher. he can light it up if he plays within our system.
Chris Boucher!
"The Brampton legend bro low key you were kinda disrespectful but it's cool. Honestly I think Brandon Clarke, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, and Khem Birch is a solid front court. Olynyk game is much better suited for international basketball, and I'm excited to see how Boucher performs in that setting too. You'd think his insane blocking ability will reak havoc on less talented role players on some of these international teams.    Dillon Brooks at 6'7 can also slide over to the 4 spot even though he seems to be allergic to rebounding."
"I know you're joking but Khem is really our only jacked big man. Chris Boucher is a twig, KO isn't very strong, Dwight Powell is kind of a tweener. And it's not like Khem is overly tall, he's just very beefy.  I would guess we are going to be starting Brandon Clarke at C."
Chris Boucher is Slim Duck or Block-Quebecois. Never heard of this Swatterboy name...
"no one calls chris boucher 'swatterboy'  &amp;#x200B;  its slim duck, or treboucher"
"I think they should mold him to Anthony Davis, Chris Boucher, Draymond, and Giannis. A combination of those skills is his ceiling. At the very least you gotta mold him into that David West, Andre Bogut role from the finals teams.   Wiseman too skilled, mobile, herkyjerky to not succeed in this team."
we'll give you chris boucher and the 9th pick for him
Chris Boucher is kind of cute pause
"Chris Boucher has 2 of the best. Treboucher and Block Quebecois (the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois is a political party in his home province of Quebec, and obviously he gets a lot of blocks)"
Chris Boucher grabs his face in horror like he just witnessed a homicide whenever he gets a foul.
"Danny Green and Patrick McCaw both have 3. I think Chris Boucher has 2. Its definitely possible, though unlikely to be right place and right time for 5 rings."
"They were shooting an unreal percentage on contested shots. Sometimes there are nights where everything goes in. Knicks are a solid team but they aren't elite. Toronto's bench was atrocious without their 6 man of the year, Chris Boucher."
Imagine thinking we could win without Chris Boucher
So would be getting Chris Boucher back for Toronto. Toronto's bench is so trash without him.
Toronto Raptors missing Chris Boucher this game.
"7. POKU!!!!!!!  What a wild ride. I have no idea what position¬†[Aleksej Pokusevski](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683018/aleksej-pokusevski)¬†plays, what he will amount to, how he does not snap in half at some point every game, and whether he's even supposed to be helping the Thunder right now. Pokusevski missed his first 14 NBA shots. Some of his jumpers whistle on such a line-drive trajectory, you fear they might smash the backboard. Pokusevski is so tall and lanky, he sometimes appears to be shooting down at the basket.  Any Pokusevski touch could end in some kind of strange basketball brilliance you've never quite seen before, or a pratfall-level disaster -- Pokusevski tripping over his own unruly limbs; a pass that soars 10 rows into the stands; a jumper so wayward everyone under the basket ducks as if an anvil is about to fall on their heads.  Like, what precisely is going on here? That's top-of-the-arc isolation that morphs into an up-and-under. You've seen that move before, but have you ever seen that? The loping footwork flummoxes¬†[Chris Boucher](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3948153/chris-boucher). It's unclear if Pokusevski is shooting or trying to pass off the backboard to himself.  He's shooting 33% overall, and 27% from deep. Those numbers are up in April -- 37% overall, an encouraging 35% on 3s -- but they could only go up. Still, you can see why several teams were enamored with him. The Thunder traded up to get Pokusevski because they knew they could lose out on him otherwise. Pokusevski is 7-foot, and two skills stood out even through those early struggles: passing and shot-blocking. Both evince some undercurrent of advanced feel. Pokusevski is a connector -- someone who can receive the ball in the middle of a possession, assignments and rotations in flux, and problem-solve on the fly with some panache. Pokusevski scoots past the defender rushing at him, maps the floor, and manipulates the defense with a lookaway.  He's swatting 1.7 shots per 36 minutes, 30th among rotation players. He is willing to throw his body in the way around the basket, and his arms are a problem."
I always think Chris Boucher is an ESPN/Ringer media guy. Has one of those names
"Patrick McCaw, Talen Horton-Tucker, Chris Boucher are among a few who can emulate this distinction."
Chris Boucher died for this.
"He should win for sure, but Chris boucher as a dark horse is the first thing to come to mind.   Shoutout to JC (Utah) , stats dont show it, but he has improved imo. Not saying he should get more recognition for the award, just saying he has notably improved and excelled in utah."
Chris Boucher üôÉ
Grizzlies fans hyping up a guy who's worse than Chris Boucher
It's definitely a bad contract but it's not terrible. The real head scratcher is that the pelicans gave up assets to have the opportunity to give Adams 17M/year in an offseason where guys like Christian Wood signed for less and Jakob Poeltl and Chris Boucher signed for like half the amount per year.
Chris boucher
Chris Boucher with a handle
"He looks really good.   7 footer with a solid face up game, really good agility/mobility, and solid 3 point shooting.   He looks like he might be 190-200 lbs soaking wet though. So right now I would say he looks like a better version of Chris Boucher"
"I completely agree with your take, I'm tired of seeing volume scorers win it every year. Even when LouWill won it with us, he was a decent scorer but he didn't really impact *winning*.  I also have a bias this year: Chris Boucher has been getting it done on both ends, averaging 14/7 with 2 bpg in just 24 mpg. His efficiency is also off the charts (.602 eFG% and .641 TS%), but he's likely not even gonna be in the discussion because he doesn't have the volume or team record."

"Raptors, they have one of the best coaches in the NBA and have a really nice core. Dont sleep on Malachi Flynn and Chris Boucher. They have been really fun to watch this season."
"This is how bad he is.  This lineup:  Fred VanVleet, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, Chris Boucher, Khem Birch  Is better than this lineup:  Fred Vanvleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Baynes.  Khem Birch is such an upgrade that him plus G-Leaguers is better than 2 all-stars and OG."

"You guys are getting ridiculous. Simmons with a team built around his skills would be a hugely beneficial player. If he played with a Brook Lopez and Chris Boucher as his big men that would open up so many more driving lanes to get to the rim, Tobias and Embiid clog the paint up just a bit too much for him to get to the hoop often.   Now if he's gonna shoot 30% from the line for the rest of his career I might be a better NBA player than him, that's just completely unacceptable and I don't think it'll remain that low long term."
"they are similar enough to make the comparison.  giannis is a bit of a unique person in the league. kd is one of the closest comparables.  fine, what about a guy like chris boucher on the raptors. his jumper is awkward as fuck but he still shoots a relatively good clip."
"Ok and Bball Index‚Äôs estimated wins added metric has Tatum tied with Dame for fifth most wins added and behind only Jokic, Gobert, Steph, and Giannis.  Edit: Also going purely by this:  Conley &gt; Doncic  Conley and Fred VanVleet &gt;  CP3, Trae, and Zack LaVine  Above guys and Chris Boucher and Poeltl &gt; Mitchell, Tatum, and Beal  Above and Boban &gt; Lamelo   Above guys and Alec Burks and Patrick Beverly &gt; Booker"

Why does that list not have Chris Boucher?
We literally have Chris Boucher and Khem Birch on the roster
Chris Boucher  Khem Birch  Oshae Brissett  Anthony Bennett  Cory Joseph  Jamal Magloire
khem birch and chris boucher are 2 current ones
Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher
Insert Chris Boucher into starting line up and we are fine
"This what I been saying. The freak can layup from the free throw line, put him in the damn post. Stop using him like low-rent Chris Boucher."
"Capella est suisse et Embiid de Cameroune, ils ne comprendraieny peut-√™tre pas. Chris Boucher lui comprendrait parfaitement, il vient de Montr√©al-Nord!"

Chris Boucher seems like the prototype perfect pairing with Luka.
"Trade Porzingis plus the worse version of him (Kleber). Need a big, doesn't necessarily need to be a stretch, and a secondary ball handler/playmaker.  Possible trade: Kristaps + 2 firsts (maybe add a second) for Chris Boucher and Fred Vanvleet"
I‚Äôd try to trade Porzingis and Richardson to the Raptors for Chris Boucher and Malachi Flynn
I‚Äôd take Chris Boucher from Toronto
Chris Boucher would like to have a word
Imagine if he were even Chris Boucher level. Mavs would already be moving on.
"Montreal, Quebec has 3 NBA players with 6 championships!  Joel Anthony: 2012, 2013 Chris Boucher: 2019  Bill Wennington: 1996, 1997, 1998"
He‚Äôs talking about the 6. Meaning LeGM is trading him to Toronto for Chris Boucher and 12 gallons of maple syrup.
His votes were:  1. Jeremi Grant 2. Michael Porter Jr.  3. Chris Boucher
I mean Jordan Bell and Chris Boucher all look like beasts at Oregon too. Boucher is a built different tho
You should watch Chris Boucher lmfao man falls every time he‚Äôs in the paint
Like what?  Chris Boucher was criticized for going grocery shopping.  Tell me what Siakam could have done.
"Excuse me sir but may I introduce you Chris Boucher, he would like a word."
He should spend the summer with Chris Boucher
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
Devonte Graham  Danny Green  DeAndre Hunter  Chris Boucher  Jakob Poetl
"Okay yeah, Gasol as the bench 5, either Thad or Chris Boucher as the bench 4. Gasol isn't known for scoring on offense anymore but he's still got probably the best vision for a 5 out of any center not named Nikola Jokic."
Young 28 year old Chris Boucher lol
"Chris Boucher doubled his ppg, too!  I still think Randle deserves it, but I think of you were just looking at ‚Äúpercent improvement of stats‚Äù, Randle wouldn‚Äôt get it."
His upside is 6‚Äô11 Klay Thompson. Realistically he‚Äôs like a way upgraded Chris Boucher
"When Toronto won the ECF, I remember wandering the streets with some friends (crazy ass night in itself, ran into Drake randomly). Also ran into Chris Boucher sneaking off to his condo lol. We ended up behind the stadium and everyone was waiting for the Raptors players to drive out and every time they did their cars would get mobbed and surrounded for a few moments before security cleared the way.  Eventually the bus for the Bucks left the stadium and holy shit was it brutallll. They basically were stuck in traffic waiting; and that gave fans enough time through the tinted windows to see where Giannis, Bledsoe, Middleton, etc were sitting. And holy shit those guys got roasted hardddd. And they just had to sit their and watch behind the tinted window.  I kinda felt bad lol"
"Off the top of my head we have Olynyk, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson, and Dwight Powell. I'm not sure which of them will decide to play though."
I still think Chris Boucher should have won.   14/7 and 2 blocks in 24 min per game. Shot well from the field (51%) and the 3pt line (38%) and he came off the bench in 46/60 games.
"Lol, I do..always!  He reps Canada hard and wants to play each year, plus is besties with Jamal Murray and was one of the early commits last year and again this year too.  Honestly love his game and followed his whole career and because he played a few years of college and was a 2nd round draft pick to a weak team his buzz was never huge.  Showed flashes of promise late in his rookie year by than was injured his entire 2nd year.    He came back and had a great 3rd year lady year and now in his 4rth year he is A 2-way star, or close to it all season for Memphis.  He is a slightly better RJ Barrett type but will eventually get passed by RJ if RJ keeps going the way he is.  It's unlikely Brooks makes an all-star by game, but he will be near that level for a few years in his prime for sure.  He might be our 4rth or 5th main player in Victoria, or 5th to 7th with our complete team including Murray and all out stars.  Clearly we need some bigs to show up an play big for us, but I f I ranked guys right now, he may even be #4 or 5th, behind only Jamal, Shai and Wiggins and possibly be tied with RJ. Than Nekeil Alexander Walker.  Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson would all be very close too.  Than, very close behind your next tier by would be the Brandon Clarke's, Khem Birch, Lugentze Dort, Dwight Powel, Oshai Brissett"
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
"&gt;the best 3rd string Center in... NBA history  Just two years ago, Toronto had Serge Ibaka, Jonas Valanciunas, Greg Monroe, Chris Boucher, and Marc Gasol at various points in the same season.  They often had three of them and sometimes played 3 in a game.  3-time MVP Moses Malone was briefly the 3rd-string center for the Buffalo Braves, so he'd be the best ever, by a considerable margin.  As soon as Buffalo traded him, he started posting 14/13 for Houston ( and he had already put up a 19/15 full season two years earlier in the ABA, at 19 years old )."
"He shot sixty against a league built to stop him, with multiple 280 pound behemoths on each roster, and multiple players in the lane at all times.  Today, he'd be going against Christian Wood, and Blake Griffin, and Chris Boucher, and company."
Thats Chris Boucher
"Does anyone else remember that Oregon team with Brooks, Jordan Bell, Chris Boucher, Tyler Dorsey, and Payton Pritchard?  Might‚Äôve been my fave college basketball team I‚Äôve ever followed (I just pick and choose college teams depending on the year)."
I‚Äôd protect:  1) Siakam 2) OG Anunoby  3) Fred VanVleet 4) Chris Boucher  5) Gary Trent Jr.
Where is Chris Boucher? He should be front runner imo but barely anyone is even considering him.  Clarkson's was nice to start the season but his efficiency at the end was ass.
Meanwhile Chris Boucher not in there is a travesty
"Randle wasn't even on his ballot, but Chris Boucher was, which honestly is pathetic for a supposed ""Senior NBA Insider"""
Yeah I would definitely like Chris Boucher to be there but I don‚Äôt think you can really swap him out for anyone here
Chris Boucher over Baynes for the first half of the season
Maybe Chris Boucher
"Brooks wasn't really a PF. He was playing alongside Jordan Bell and Chris Boucher a lot. He was more of a 3 and initiated a lot of PnR on offense. He may have defended 4s at times, but if you had to label him as anything it'd be a ""3"""
"Playoff experience for us especially doesn‚Äôt mean much. Nurse was never going to play the young guys in any meaningful game, he never did. Last year in the postseason, Chris Boucher and Terence Davis were basically stapled to the bench. Chris may have earned an opportunity this go around, but other than Trent, our young guys wouldn‚Äôt get that experience this go around. The other pieces of the core have already been in a bunch of playoff series"
"We'll see lmao. We'll have plenty of chances in the next couple years. Def more than Playoff BeyBlade, Freddie, and.... 28 year old Chris Boucher??"

why am i watching chris boucher play cod on a saturday night
1. Demar Derozan Went Derozan raptor on Chris Boucher  2. Lebron James with no regard for human life  3. Here comes Mc Grady oh he just sucked the gravity right out of the building   Basically anything with Kevin Harlan
"I'm a (Raptors) homer and don't think Lowry is as good as Chris Paul, but you're not doing Kyle justice comparing him to Fred.   One of Kyle's go-to moves is to dribble along the baseline and try to make a play from under the basket. His handle is tight enough that he can operate in a crowd and find his slasher (e.g. Boucher). Fred does exactly what you're describing though. He has low efficiency at the rim and tends not to facilitate from the paint.   It's interesting to consider which parts of Kyle's game are better than Chris's though.  He's a more versatile defender since he's quite a bit stronger (+20lbs) and defends much larger players.  The uniqueness of his charge-drawing also allows him to protect the paint against bigger players.  I think his other main advantage is that Lowry plays a strong transition game. He inbounds as quickly as he can, he runs, has his QB passes, and does his pull-up transition 3s. Chris Paul walks the ball up on almost every single play."
"The good thing about Lowry is that he excels in both on-ball and off-ball scenarios. You give him the ball and he'll make bigs like Chris Boucher/Biyombo look better than they really are.   You take the ball out of his hands and he's making cuts, getting to open corners, settings screens (yes you heard that right) or just being a pest in general on the defensive end."
"a chris boucher trade for the raptors feels like it could be an unexpected thing that happens, long term I dont see them keeping siakam and boucher as boucher transitions more into the 4 and will want a much fatter contract next season. I also wouldn't be totally shocked at a FVV trade if the raps draft suggs and he starts rolling."
"That make sense.  If we are talking more role players, 3 point shooting and +switchable defending bigs, my top choice would be Maxi Kleber.  He isn't a great defender at the rim or on the perimeter, but hes at least average at both.  He's a high volume and high % shooter out at the 3 point line.    Chris Boucher would be my sleeper pick, tho it remains to be seen if his 3 point % is real or an abberation.  He is a very good rim protector and not a terrible physical mismatch defending switches.  But he's really young so his defense &amp; game is largely still a question mark."
"As a Raptors fan:  Fred VanVleet, #4 pick, Chris Boucher, however many future picks/swaps Portland wants. Basically anything on the roster except Siakam and OG.  (I know this won't happen and Portland will get better offers)"
"**2022 Raptors**  PG- Jalen Suggs, Malachi Flynn   SG- Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., David Duke   SF- OG Anunoby, Deandre Bembry, Rodney Hood  PF- Pascal Siakam, Jericho Sims   C- Richuan Holmes, Chris Boucher, Freddie Gillespie"
"Baynes came off a career year in 2019-2020 and that Chris boucher contract was meant to be a 1 year overpay when we still were targeting a max slot in 2021, Chris Boucher blew away all expectations and that contract looks really good rn but lots of people said that it was a overpay last year"
5 mil/year is way too little for how good he is. Aron Baynes and Chris Boucher got more last year.
"This is a pretty good move by the Celtics, but it sucks to see him leave.  For those who don't know, Aaron Miles was the HC of the Santa Cruz Warriors from 2017-2019 and Player Development Coach from 2019-21. His Santa Cruz team consisted of Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano-Anderson. This season, he was mainly credited with the improvement of Juan Toscano-Anderson and Andrew Wiggins"
"this... not true at all. Seth is good at 8 million. But there's Jokic at 29 million, Sabonis at 18 million, Christian Wood at 13 million, Chris Boucher at 6 million, Richaun Holmes at 4.8 million. Honestly, even some of the big contracts like Bradley Beal at 25 million give significantly more value. Hell, his brother is way better value per dollar at 40 million."
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7. Brook Lopez|1902 MPG|103 blocks| |8. Richaun Holmes|1782 MPG|96 blocks| |9. Robert Williams|985 MPG|91 blocks| |18. Giannis Antetokounmpo|2013 MPG|73 blocks| |21. Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."
"Half the league does this. Lowry, CP3, LeBron.. there was a play this year where Paul Watson Jr two-hand shoved someone trying to offensive rebound into Chris Boucher, Boucher fell over, Lowry and Nurse went all complain-y and Tim Duncan face. Like come on guys."
"Bro I mean a roster of Jamal, SGA, Wiggins, Barrett, Dort, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Olynyk, Dwight Powell, Chris Boucher and Cory Joseph is pretty ridiculously good, they have a lot of exciting younger guys too...Alexander-Walker comes to mind. A fully healthy Canadian B-ball Olympic team has gotta be the second best team in the world by a long shot, right?"
"Or Brooks, or Birch, or Olynyk. Did Chris Boucher play?"
Chris Boucher is great at blocking threes on close outs
"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30369468/toronto-raptors-sign-aron-baynes-chris-boucher-2-year-deals  &gt; Free agent Aron Baynes and the Toronto Raptors have agreed to a two-year, $14.3 million deal with a team option for the second year"
"I wanna make a team just for fun lol  Stockton, Wiggins, MWP, Rodman, Ayton   Norman Powell, Chris Boucher, Ariza are the next three up. Not much point to fill out the rest."
"Jamal Murray, SGA, and to a lesser extent Chris Boucher are all injured. That's a pretty good chunk of talent between the three of them."
Was there no Chris Boucher?
"Despite the roster's wealth of NBA experience, Canada is missing a number of notable talents.  In addition to injured Denver Nuggets shooting guard¬†Jamal Murray, Oklahoma City Thunder guard¬†Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Memphis Grizzlies guard¬†Dillon Brooks, Boston Celtics big man¬†[Tristan Thompson](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/6364), Houston Rockets big man¬†[Kelly Olynyk](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/2041), and Toronto Raptors bigs¬†[Chris Boucher](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/46591)¬†and¬†[Khem Birch](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/11121)¬†are sitting out the qualifiers."
"And Jamal Murray, Dillon Brooks, Chris Boucher, Kelly Olnyk, Tristan Thompson, etc."
Boucher instead of Lyles was the necessary move but Chris' recovering from a knee injury  :C
"It's sad because we do, both Chris Boucher and Khem Birch are Canadian, but I believe Boucher is injured and Birch is a FA and didn't want to risk it. Really sucks because we could have used some size."
"Chris Boucher, Deandre Bembry and a 2024 FRP"
"Who we really need is Chris Boucher, the block Quebecois!"
"I hate these stupid takes. If anything this season has shown it has shown that it‚Äôs very possible for once overlooked talent to show dramatic improvement at age 25 or 26. As a Warriors fan you should automatically agree to this after a year of Wiggins, but there‚Äôs also Julius Randle, Zach LaVine (he‚Äôs been balling for a while now but this year was undeniable), Christian Wood, Chris Boucher, Jerami Grant, etc."
"Trading an a bench player (George Hill) for 2 guys and a pick is not the same as trading Kyle Lowry and Chris Boucher to move up 1 spot. You're far more likely to get Fultz or McDyess than you are Luka.  Raptrors are absolutely a contender, whether you want to call it injuries or selective tanking no player played over 61 games. You're putting your team into potential NBA purgatory to move up 1 spot.  Kevin Love is a negative asset. You'd have to attach a pick just to get rid of him.  If you want a rebuild do it:  A Pick(s) for Lowry A Pick for Boucher Multiple Picks for Siakam, VanVleet, and even OG too. A Pick for taking on Love's contract.  You could walk away with a Thunder style haul. It's all moot, the Raptors are obviously planning on competing, They traded Powell for Hood not a pick."
block quebecois for chris boucher
That‚Äôs actually belong to Chris Boucher now
"Jamal Murray - SGA - Corey Joseph   Dillion Brooks - Lugentz Dort     RJ Barrett - Andrew Wiggins   Kelly Olynyk - Chris Boucher   Tristan Thompson -  Dwight Powell - Khem Birch     Barely misses cut: NAW, Nembhard, Ejim, Mulder"
How come no Chris Boucher or Khem Birch?
"Formatting iasues haha. Some of those opinions i have at the first look are crazy. But when it is looked deeper, all of them  after this season look realistic - Houston showed they have good team potential. Kenyon is good, Tate is good Khyri Thomas can be x factor, Kevin Porter Jr will surely be elite, every one forgots about Eric Gordon, it only takes Kevin Porter Jr improvments in consistency and drafting right guy (Mobley) to turn the things up. Their struggles comes from inexpirience and from the fact Wood is not True defensive anchor ( why i wish  they draft Mobley). About Ntilikina he shot 47% from the three while being good defender-he can be shorter shooting guard, because of insane wingspan but Thibs is afraid or what ever. Gobert there is no need to explain yes he was in the paint but it is not center role to run and contest corner three pointers in drop schemes, it should be wing roles. About Mikal Bridges, he had in the regular season pull up midranges and it looked okay-his ball handling improvments are real and i am sure suns will work on his pull up shot to become a threat so opponent  will have harder time to guard him. Toronto has high draft pick, their development is nice, they arent bad team but injuries and no home court ruined them. While Lowry is year older, there is always a possibility someone of the raptors bench mob players has a break out. And honestly about break outs, i expect Og Anunoby break out, while Chris Boucher, even though not so young can still get some weight and become even better defender. Michael Porter JR had a hard time in the playoffs(was guarded by only consistent defender on the Portland trail blazers, Covington, and also good suns wing defense) but Michael Porter Jr in the regular season was hitting  pretty wild shots without hesitation, and has shown he can be good pull up shooter. He will work on quickness and counter moves and it will make him into next Kd. Poetl showed improvments in pnr defense. He is ok on switch but struggles come in the moment when he need to choose coverage - he gets stuck. It will change though. Dejounte gaining weight and strenght will also help because spurs pnr defense is  affected by  Dejounte struggles at fighting trough screens. ."
"As well as Kelly Olynyk, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Oshae Brisset, Dillon Brooks and a couple others. Fully healthy this team would be scary"
"I‚Äôve got a better one, Raptors trade the 4th overall pick, all of their future first and second round picks, and Chris Boucher for Cedi Osman and a second rounder."
Chris Boucher / and a scrub to Warriors for Kelly O
"What? 2019 Raptors:  Lowry, FVV, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Siakam, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Norm Powell, Chris Boucher‚Ä¶  They were stacked. They won the ship and probably would have ran it back the next year if they kept their horses.  A healthy Nets from this year would beat them but not sure any other team would in 7 games."
Chris Boucher
Stop making us raps fans look delusional we already get a bad rep    Chris Boucher Age: 28    Jarrett Allen Age: 23
2x NBA champ Chris Boucher and Mr. Mississippi Basketball Rodney Hood of course
"We get it across the board as Celtic fans.   2K won't even give us a strong Semi Ojeleye.  [At 20 years old, Grant Williams was in the 96th percentile for strength testing by P3.](https://twitter.com/Sam_Vecenie/status/1139560922647654400)   They don't have to be made into all-stars but both those dudes are stronger than Jabari Parker and Chris Boucher."
"Could really use some front court. No tt, Kelly, Chris boucher, khem birch, oshae brissett, yikes"
Chris Boucher on the PF as well for added depth
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
Chris boucher
Or Chris Boucher
"If Trae Young and Chris Boucher were teammates, they could call that alley-oop combo the TraeBoucher."
"Well the one guy in his lowlights post said it best. He found one stat with a tiny sample size about Seth Curry not being good at guarding isolation, got clowned for it and now is using bias and what not to try to prove Seth is the worst defender of all time. He said this:  &gt;Seth has never blocked a 3 point shot in his life due to his short short wing span. NBA should consider all 3s wide open when Seth Curry defends it.  Which is like, stupid as fuck to say. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the vast majority of NBA players haven‚Äôt blocked a three point shot in their career. You don‚Äôt need go-go gadget Chris Boucher. It‚Äôs about getting a hand in the face, getting your body in there, making it awkward for the shooter. He‚Äôs using 3 point blocks to quantify defense. Seth is like, not even as bad as most point guards are defensively."
"It‚Äôs good in the backcourt and on the wing, but the bigs are dicey. Like, they‚Äôd have to live with some combination of Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, and Chris Boucher. They‚Äôre not bad in an Olympic context, but compared to the US or Serbia they‚Äôll have a tough time."

"Purely shot blockers:   Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Nerlens Noel, Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capella all come to mind. All of them are great at block shots eplicitly. But not all of them are elite level interior defenders &amp; rim protectors.   Best rim protectors/interior defenders is a similar list, but it excludes players who are great at getting blocks but not doing much else defensively. That list for me would be:   Rudy Gobert, Clint Capella, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo etc..."
I‚Äôd also add Chris Boucher up there but he is a little bit foul prone
"The last notable Canadian players are all from Montreal from Dortz to Chris Boucher or even Karim mane. Montreal is notable for it‚Äôs night life which will entice players. It‚Äôs also one of the biggest markets in North America. Ranked 4th actually behind New York, Toronto and Sam Francisco"
"Chris Paul, Chris Mullin, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh, Chris Boucher"
"Chris Paul, Kris Dunn, Chris Silva, Khris Middleton, Chris Boucher"
Chris Boucher: HoF skinniness.
Chris Boucher &amp; Matisse Thybulle: Blocking Jumpshots
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they‚Äôve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn‚Äôt an executive in the league that matches Masai‚Äôs overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
Chris Boucher to the Kings
"Boucher means butcher in French. Chris Boucher is not, in fact, a butcher."
"Pascal Siakam - lives up this name 'Shock'em' when he takes over games  OG Anunoby - he's no longer a new noobie  Fred VanVleet - not a van rental company with a fleet of vans  Scottie Barnes - not a barn or more  Khem Birch - he could be a tree hard to move, yes  Malachi Flynn - His father Eric, active social media, doesn't think that nn (nick nurse) is fly for not giving his son playing time  Chris Boucher - lives up his Trebuchet moniker due to his unique 3pt catapult-like release"
chris boucher is not a young player he is almost 29

Chris Boucher was not a member of the Toronto Raptors for the 2017-2018 season.
I think Denver doesn't wanna play him cause he's too skinny to be a 5 and is too slow to be a four. I feel like he could still be a great sixth man for a team though as a 7'3 Chris boucher type player
Chris Boucher
who is replacing the center? is chris boucher starting?
"I didn't have time to read the whole tweet. I rushed to his bedside, pillow in hand and put our beloved out of his misery.  Good Night Sweet Prince.  edit: WTF man did I just suffocate Chris Boucher over a joke? Good one guy. Boy is my face red."
Chris Boucher is a dad. Confirmed!
Chris ‚ÄòJohnny Bravo‚Äô Boucher
TIL Chris Boucher is 28
Is Chris Boucher my 50 year old uncle?
Chris Boucher gaining 50 lbs this offseason and winning DPOY
Kendrick Nunn was a good find but GS let him go too early. Chris Boucher as well.
Who even is chris boucher
Chris Boucher a professional nephew
Chris Boucher. He isn‚Äôt strong but his stamina is unreal and makes up for it. Apparently raptors doctors found he has unusually high white blood cells or something.
I see Birch starting but Precious possibly playing more minutes. And then Freddie G in garbage minutes.    Glad we can play Chris Boucher at the 4 comfortably now.
"Warriors revamped their whole development staff. They added Dejan Milojevic who used to coach Jokic and develop him. He‚Äôll help develop Wiseman‚Äôs foot work and court awareness for sure. They also signed Jama Mahlalela who was the assistant coach for the Toronto raptors and the raptors are known for having the best development staff in the league. Players like OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam are products of that. This will benefit both kuminga and moody but especially kuminga seeing the previous results. They also signed Kenny Atkinson who is known for being one of the best development coaches in the league. When he was the head coach for the nets he made them have a break out year and developed players like levert, Allen, and DLO. Also, the warriors had developed a lot of good players, it‚Äôs just bc they were in a dynasty for a while that they couldn‚Äôt use them. For example, both kendrick nunn and Chris Boucher developed under the warriors. Some examples on the current warriors include JTA and Jordan Poole. But they didn‚Äôt really have much to work with. Wiseman was their first lottery pick in years and you can‚Äôt really develop him much when there‚Äôs no summer league or training camp. But the fact is that they finally got good rookies and It‚Äôs a whole new coaching staff"
"And that list is just the call ups. It doesn't include players like Siakam, Chris Boucher, Richaun Holmes, Paul Reed, JJ Barea, Jeremy Lin, Gerald Green and others who weren't called up, but rather transitioned between seasons."
He on that Chris Boucher pack
"Hahaha didnt expect that answer. We have had Cory Joseph, Anthony Bennett, Oshee Brissett recently.  Currently we have Chris Boucher, Khem Birch and Dalano Banton. We are good for Canadian content.  I like Powell but i completely understand why they want more with that 2 year contract (even if 2nd year is a partial guarantee)"
thats 2X NBA CHAMPION Chris Boucher
"Chris Boucher won MVP and DPOY in 2019, yet he's a backup big at best. Lmao."
Chris Boucher
"RJ, Dillon Brooks, Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, NAW, Khem Birch, Olynyk, etc. They won't challenge the US, but are definitely a medal contender if everyone plays"
"Without shoes:  Pascal is 6‚Äô8.25‚Äù, Chris Boucher is 6‚Äô8‚Äù, Khem Birch 6‚Äô7.5‚Äù, Scottie Barnes 6‚Äô7‚Äù, Freddie Gillespie 6‚Äô9‚Äù, Dalano Banton 6‚Äô7.75‚Äù, Precious Achiuwa 6‚Äô7.5‚Äù, Yuta Watanabe 6‚Äô8‚Äù, and Sam Dekker 6‚Äô7.75‚Äù. So most of these guys would end up being 6‚Äô9‚Äù in shoes, except Scottie Barnes, who‚Äôd be 6‚Äô8‚Äù in shoes, and Freddie Gillespie, who‚Äôd be 6‚Äô10‚Äù in shoes."
Lol Chris Boucher comes off one MIP campaign and now he's expected to pull off another?
"Stanley Johnson, Chris Boucher and a 2nd Rd Pick Lol"
"The 2017 warriors   Curry (2x Mvp) Klay  (all star HOF) Iguadala (all star, finals MVP) Durant (MVP, 2xFMVP)  Dray (all star, defensive player of the year)  David West (all star) Livingston Pre Leg Injury was a STUD Nick Young  Javale  Chris Boucher  Patrick mccaw 3 time champ (lmao)   But I think #1 sleeper is 2013-2014 nets   Deron Williams (all star) Joe Johnson (all star) Pierce (all star, fmvp) KG (mvp, DPOY) Brook Lopez (all star)  Jason Terry (6 man of year, clutch underrated) Andre Kirilenko (all star, all nba defense) Livingston   That team would be insane in their prime"
Chris boucher
"SGA, RJ Barrett, Jamal Murray, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk. Thats a playoff team. Name 5 countries that can match that talent output. The only thing holding this team back is injuries. Don't be surprised when Canada becomes a legitimate medal threat."
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
I think Boucher is the better defender for his position and is pretty damn underrated. He only played 24 minutes a night and I know this stat is not perfect but per 36 minutes Chris boucher actually shot more threes a game than Pope at 5.8 attempts a game vs popes 5.5 a game. Also his per 36 numbers of 20/10 and 2.8 blocks is great. Hopefully he puts on a bit more muscle so he can be a full time 5
Chris Boucher is a realistic target and I prefer him over pope
Chris Boucher please
"Same with Chris Boucher, he's 28 just 3yrs into the league. It's easy to think new players are young rookies with plenty of time to peak."
We will take one Chris Boucher please (or Pascal if you are feeling generous)
"That team was so stacked now that I think about it..  Kyle Lowry  Danny Green  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Marc Gasol  Fred VanVleet  Norman Powell  OG Anunoby   Serge Ibaka  A solid 9 man rotation with a perfect blend of offense and defense.. and that‚Äôs not including guys like Chris Boucher, Patrick McCaw or Jeremy Lin"
"There are some funny stories from last year about Chris Boucher and Ibaka not being able to understand each others' French due to differences in regional accents. But yeah, this isn't a rare thing."
"You're saying that because morey made the raptors an offer that was hilariously bad, that's evidence that more teams would rather trade for Ben than for OG?  So if we ask for Trae, Collins and capela in return for Chris Boucher, that must mean that Trae isn't worth much.  Logic üíØüíØüíØ"
Dam the raptors lets chris boucher and khem birch walk or they never had any guarantee with the team?
"Chris Boucher shoots like the superior medieval siege weapon. Everytime he loads up I'm going ""man that's a brick"" and then its just a swish.  Joe Ingles too, especially when he'd have that wild deep dip on his jumper."
"Are you familiar with Fred Van Vleet, Pascal Siakim, Norm Powell, Chris Boucher and OG Anunoby?  Their draft and development record is better than almost any team in the NBA.  Nobody is 100 percent but Maisi/Webster are pretty good."
"Masai is trying to build the world record for longest wingspan on a single team. Instead of leaning into the three-ball era, he's drafting counters to it. Imagine a team of Chris Boucher"
Check out former GSW Chris Boucher  .565 FT% in his last year at Oregon  Drafted age 24  Last season he went .788 FT% with a .383 3PT%
"I legit think the trade thats gonna happen is Kyle Lowry,Chris Boucher and a protected pick for Simmons"
"Chris Boucher has the nickname Treboucher because of his 3 form, but on nights where he can't land them my friend and I call him Catapult"
What if I told you that Frank Mason III and Chris Boucher are two of the last G League MVPs
"We had a jumbo line up last year that was tested a bit. Can't remember who was playing the 3 but I think it was either rondae or Chris. Siakam at point.      Gasol, Ibaka, RHJ/boucher, OG, Siakam"
"Lol they were hyping up Davis, Malachi Flynn and Chris Boucher as future prospects but he wants to talk about us üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"Ours is more recent though Dillon Brooks is looking nice in Memphis. We got Payton Pritchard, Bol Bol, Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell...so pretty meh generally. Aaron Brooks I guess had a few years he looked nice in Houston but that's getting into old head territory/outside the 10 year window...."
Are you counting Chris Boucher as being from St Lucia?   He was born there but he plays for Canada
"So I didn't heed to country boundaries, which is why Montrealers like Dort, Chris Boucher &amp; Karim Man√© are on the Celtics, since Montreal is closer to Boston than to Toronto as the crow flies. The only players I manually sent to teams were Andre Drummond &amp; Devin Booker, as they were crossing large bodies of water."
Chris Boucher grew up in Montreal so he should be on the Raps.
"a much better player to replace Dwight Powell's role as Luka's roller to the paint - at the super top end it's Giannis Antetokounmpo or Anthony Davis, then maybe John Collins or Chris Boucher as more realistic options?"
We are the title favourites next year so we will probably sign some ring chasers and we are hoping for a Kevin Love buyout. We really dont need to do anything significant but I would like to get Chris Boucher for pick 27 + Shamet and Alize
Chris Boucher as a backup 4.
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Donƒçiƒá / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schr√∂der / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
Goran Dragic + Chris Boucher for Simmons is going to be Masai's next fleece job
"Starters:  steph (superstar)  klay (all-star)  og anunoby  giannis (superstar)  deandre ayton (all-star)  Bench: fred vanvleet, seth curry, caris levert, michael porter jr, aaron gordon, chris boucher, brook lopez   Good combination of offense, defense, play-making, and fit imo"
Chris Boucher
"I always thought if Chris Boucher would become an actual NBA player it would be because he bulked up, but it turns out swatting all the shots and shooting his catapult over every defender is still highly effective despite being rail thin."
"You really think Toronto is better than Atlanta going into this season?Vanvleet/OG/Pascal are good players but they've lost a lot of the pieces that made them a contender in 2020. Lowry of course, but also Norm, Ibaka, and Gasol. Replacing them with Chris Boucher and Gary Trent is fine, but even with Lowry, Ibaka, and a better year of Siakam that team had a shot creation problem which they have yet to address. They should be a playoff team but I'd move them at least a tier down."
4 of the 6 times it‚Äôs happened it was steve Kerr related Steve Kerr did it Chris Boucher won one with the Warriors and one against them  Patrick McCaw won one with the Warriors and one against them Danny Green won one against the Warriors
"&gt;Kristaps Porzingis, ""The Trebuchet"" because he's 100-feet tall and launches slow shots from a mile away.  That nickname has also stuck with our fanbase and local announcers for Chris Boucher, since his name literally sounds like ""trebuchet"" and he's French Canadian and can bomb 3s as a center."
"Can't believe I've actually put thought into this, but NBA team pretty easily IMO. Only problem is Akashi with his eyes but if he wants to go ahead a score all the points for his team go for it I guess.  Kise might be a problem for the 5 minutes he enters his perfect copy &amp; zone, but other than that he's not really a threat. He's also only 6'2, so even if he could copy MJ's moves he won't be able to pull them off effectively. A guy like MJ would be shooting fadeaways over him, and a guy like LeBron would just power through him. He doesn't have the height of MJ or power of LeBron to pull those off effectively at all.  Midorima is pretty useless since he can only hit open half court shots. Stick LeBron and his Kawhi-like defense on him and he's basically useless. Rest of the team can play 4v4 easily.  Aomine is 6'4 190 lbs, Wilt will eat him alive.  Murasakibara is 6'10 210 lbs, he's basically Chris Boucher lmao. Shaq would dance on him, dunk on him, and clown tf out of him."
Maybe Lugentz Dort or Chris Boucher?
"More teams, definitely a bunch of college and G-league players that could use the opportunity to shine. With bloated rosters, you won't see Linsanity or Aaron Brooks or Chris Boucher. There's merit in players that are on the fringes to get meaningful minutes against NBA talent."
"Yup, they give you video clips of literally every shot, rebound, assist, steal, block, etc etc of Siakams career and it‚Äôs super easy to look up. I‚Äôd routinely watch things like ‚Äúevery OG Anunoby turnaround jumper in the 2020-21 season‚Äù or ‚Äúevery Chris Boucher blocked 3‚Äù"
"Chris Boucher, gotta sell high. We probably shoulda traded him for a late first in the draft but guess we playing the deadline game"
"Depending on the offer Chris Boucher would be very interesting. However, Pascal is out to begin the season so Boucher would have to fill in but if he performs at the same level as last year then teams will come calling.   Hell 6 teams were trying to get him last year before his breakout season and his contract is still cheap for his production last year."
I was actually the guy who drafted the team.   C Nikola Jokic/John Collins/Chris Boucher   PF Bam Adebayo/Ben Simmons   SF Shai Gilgeous Alexander/Jerami Grant/Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atl)   SG James Harden/CJ McCollum   PG Trae Young/Fred VanVleet   Coach Doc Rivers
"&gt;I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto  Guess you forgot that Pascal Siakam, Fred Vanvleet, OG Anunoby, Norman Powell, and Chris Boucher ever existed."
PG: FVV  SG: Gary Trent Jr.   SF: OG Anunoby   PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Khem Birch  Bench:  Goran Dragic  Malachi Flynn  Scottie Barnes  Chris Boucher  Precious Achiuwa
Chris Boucher Goran Dragic and a couple picks and Possibly throw in FVV depending if we get a pick back
"They'll take Stanley Johnson, Chris Boucher, 2 2nds and they're gonna *like* it"
"It's raptors. Read article about Chris Boucher and the Golden state warriors.  However, warriors poached on of the guy responsible."
Toronto has a good offer.   Fred VanVleet + Chris Boucher would both help the Sixers immediately.
"Right now he looks like a lower tier version of Chris Boucher, if we hadn‚Äôt made the finals last season he‚Äôd probably get heavy minutes this year but I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre gonna dump him to opt for more experience"
"we have 1 slightly used Goran Dragic and 1 Chris Boucher, take it or leave it"
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
Chris Boucher
"Honestly our full squad is nothing but sick names. Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Pascal Siakam, Freddy Vanvleet, OG Anuonoby, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Nick Nurse, Yuta Watanabe, Delano Blanton, Goran Dragic. even Scottie Barnes is kinda cool  Definitely top 5 team based purely on cool/unique names"
"Patrick Beverly, Marcus Smart, Lowry, CP3, in that order. Though I don't think the gulf between Lowry and CP3 is as huge as some others make it out to be.  Also Chris Boucher, Brandon Ingram and Kevin Durant.  Also Cade Cunningham, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic."
Chris Boucher     Brook Lopez     Myles Turner
It isn‚Äôt really being used but Block Qu√©b√©cois is an incredible nickname for Chris Boucher.
"Chris Boucher: Treboucher, Bloc Quebecois"
"Warriors have:  PG: D'Angelo Russell  SG: Alec Burks  SF: Harrison Barnes  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Chris Boucher  Honestly, better than I thought. That's a playoff team"
"i might be a casual for this but i literally thought chris boucher was like 22-25, i can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs 28"
Is it ~really~ a log jam?  PG: FVV / Malachi Flynn  SG: GTJ / ???  SF: OG / Yuta Watanbe  PF: Siakam / Scottie Barnes  C: Khem Birch / Chris Boucher  Also with Scottie Barnes and OG those are basically positionless players
"&gt; OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher and Yuta Watanabe  That‚Äôs not really a logjam. For one, Yuta and OG could play the 2 and have at times last season. Another thing to mention is that the front court has 3 slots while the backcourt has 2. Starting OG/Siakam/Birch then having Barnes/Boucher/Achiuwa off the bench is perfectly fine. I could see Nurse cycling in Yuta to be a positional filler in case someone goes down."
Chris Boucher. 6th Man of the year incoming. And his fugly jumpshot.
"I think people will look back at the 2019 raptors once it's all said and done and realize how much talent we had.   Lowry, Danny Green, Kawhi, Pascal, and Gasol was an amazing starting line up but Danny and Gasol were older and Pascal is still developing to this day.  Ibaka was an amazing bench big for us and was imo in his prime that year.  Fred vanvleet and Norman powell were on small contracts and have both shown improvements in the past 2 years, Norm especially looked amazing last year.  Og Anunoby didn't even play in the playoffs. He's still developing and has a high ceiling.  Chris Boucher went from playing garbage time to seeking a big contract next off season.  Jeremy Lin, and Jodie Meeks had their time in the sun at one point. Patrick McCaw was decent but injury prone.  If you combine each players peak salary year once they've all retired it will be a very high figure."
"Nick Nurse mentioned he was trying to get Chris Boucher into the game early to see if that changed his play, and that he wanted Fred to come out of the game earlier to change up his rotations and the Dalano Banton has been very impressive."
"Portland could sure use him! And Payton Pritchard. And Dillon Brooks. Maybe some Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell as well.  If I'm gonna watch us get blown out by 30 points, I can at least watch my Ducks get minutes!"
I feel like he could be more like Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher not getting any minutes because he has been horrible has been interesting to see. Considering he was very hyped up coming into the season I had really high hopes.
"@Lakers, Chris Boucher is available lmk"
Chris boucher- please watch film on mobley and strive to be good as him
" **Full quote from Jason Kidd (Wolves Head Coach)**  &gt;Scottie Barnes is a heck of a rookie. Great player. He's 20 years old, he's really really good. He causes a problem on both ends of the floor and he knows how to play the game. He's going to be a star in this league if he's not already a star. He loves to play the game. Watching him on tape, you would think he's been in the league three or four years. It's very impressive what he's doing early on in his career.  **More from Billy Donovan (Bulls Head Coach):**   &gt;""He‚Äôs going to be a very good player,"" Chicago Bulls coach Billy Donovan said prior to Monday's game. ""Very aggressive, puts it on the floor, he‚Äôs got really good length, a two-way player. Defensively, [he] can play a lot of different players. [He's] got the versatility and length to guard a lot of different people. ... He's only to get better with minutes and through playing. And certainly, he's gotten off to a great start in this early part of the season.""

Chris Boucher:  TreBoucher  The Block Qu√©b√©cois  The St-Lucien Solution
"I have lasting images of Scottie Barnes, Chris Boucher, &amp; Khem Birch/Precious Achiuwa murdering us on the offensive glass  As well as Gary Trent Jr. getting to the rim at will on us"
"alternatively, could trade for a guy like Chris Boucher later in the season. A stretch 5 on offense who still does some dirty work on D."
"This is Masai Ujiru's music. The 76ers have quickly reached Demar Derozan level prices from their outrageous demands. Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn and a 1st incoming."
"Dragic isn't under contract for next season, so he's already not being included in that group. Same for Boucher. You need to look at the salaries for 2022-23, that's what would count for trying to open up a max slot for Ayton.   Siakam, FVV, OG, Barnes and Precious is $84 million if the Raptors get rid of literally everyone else in salary dumps or just waiving them (which would include Gary Trent Jr., Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, etc). That $84 million leaves $35 million under a $119 million cap, but then you have to include about $7 million for cap holds for empty roster spots, which brings that down to $28 million. Ayton's max would start at $30 million, as it would be 25% of the $119 million cap."
Chris Boucher didn‚Äôt start playing at 20
"Chris Boucher started playing at 20.  One of the greatest rebounders ever, Dennis Rodman, started at 21.  So it's safe to say that as long as you're extremely tall and athletic you can start whenever you want"
My picks   ROY: Cade Cunningham   6MOY: Chris Boucher   DPOY: Bam Adebayo   MIP: Dejounte Murray/Terrance Mann   MVP: Giannis Antetokoumpo
"I only didn't count Bobby as I generally consider him a PF! I don't know how much of it is homer stuff but given he picked up vote(s?) for 6moy (I know Ernie on Inside voted for him) I really do think Portis was one of the best bench players in the league and in terms of big me it's him, Chris Boucher and Montrezl Harrell."
Way older than I thought wtf  Gives me early Chris Boucher vibes
"your posts are so garbage dude.  1) it's not like Barnes is on a hot fluky shooting streak in pre-season. he's showing defensive versatility, play-making and IQ, and he's only 20 years old. he's leading the team in assists as a 6'8 positionless player. Suggs, the supposed PG isn't even coming close lmfao and hasn't shown anything that would've warranted the raptors taking him over barnes. and outshine what potential?  his shooting still sucks and he's demonstrating that's he's not that good of a playermaker. yeah i bet you're impressed by Suggs half court fluke shot and his fancy, risky bounce passes. he honestly doesn't do anything better than Barnes and Barnes has a lot more going for him for success in the NBA. not to mention Suggs' arrogance, claiming he has no weaknesses in his game LOL.  2) it wouldn't be shocking if he averages less than 10ppg as a rookie. it's clear his offensive game is raw. did Kawhi, Pascal, OG, Giannis or similar molds average more than 10 ppg as a rookie? no.   3)why the fuck should we care about college accomplishments? This is the NBA dude LOL. Should we put Adam Morrison in the hall of fame because of his college game? Fuck outta here.   4)Barnes has better tools than all the players you listed. Bol Bol, Isaac, Bender don't have his combination of versatility, wing span, vision, and IQ, not to mention his personality and leadership   5)are you stupid, a troll or just ignorant? The championship run wasn't all Kawhi and this has been discussed to death. Let's see the players who have improved with the Raptors : OG 23rd overall, Pascal 27th overall, Norm Powell 2nd rounder, Fred Van Vleet undrafted, Chris Boucher undrafted, Lowry, Serge Ibaka. players recognize the Raptors reputation for player development because it's played out before our eyes over the past decade. you're head is so far up your ass it isn't even funny"
"Whats going on with Stanley ""Next Kawhi"" Johnson, Chris ""KP"" Boucher, Malachi ""Jason Kidd"" something"
Most I'd offer is GTJ and Chris Boucher
Scottie Barnes is Chris Boucher with extreme hyperactivity
Not saying I would do this but would Chris Boucher + Yuta and a pick be fair value?
Bol Bol is basically a longer Chris Boucher
"Helps space the floor, I guess. Throw Chris Boucher next to him"
"I think the raptors have the biggest draw. The raptors develop anything and treat people with respect.   It's a big city with media stars like drake. Jb and the weekend pulling up from time to time.   Trade Fred vanvleet , since he's a versatile scorer and decent passer avg 6 assist. With Chris boucher , Goran dragic for Phillies draft pics next 2 years and Tyrese Maxey, Isiah Joe rookie too.   I say by November when the raptors have a slow star when they realize pascal siakam isn't the  the first option type of guy but a co star."
Boucher? Why is Chris Boucher mentioned here?
"Hakeem to Beat Embiid and Jokic in the 2020's, feast on Boucher and slow LeBron at the rim, slow Shaq, Duncan, Webber in the 2000's, feast on Longley/Rodman kinda for the 90's and hold up against Kareem in the 70's. Klay' shooting and defense is useful against any modern team, and he can probably slow older shooters like Bird and MJ a little. I think he'd fit with Hakeem because he's Kenny Smith but better at like literally everything. Hakeem was a serviceable ball handler but he could be a black hole so I'm going to say Chris Paul as playmaker and get the ball to Hakeem to the post and open looks to Klay. He can also serviceable score, which eases the burden from Hakeem, who can play more defense. I didn't watch the 70's or 80's but I'm hoping that Hakeem would slow their bigmen and Klay and CP3 would straight up outplay the older players."
"Sabonis isn't a stretch 5, wtf are you talking about. Simmons would be a perfect fit with KAT and maybe Chris Boucher"
"Yeah he needs a 3&amp;D PF to pair with, which isn't an easy ask. KD? AD? Chris Boucher?"
Chris Boucher is the 3rd oldest Raptor. Only Birch and Dragic are older.
"Chris Boucher.  He's a pretty good 3pt shooter, but his style is quite unusual cos he's so gangly. Hence why he's called tre-boucher."
"When the Raptors picked up a young looking project prospect by the name Chris Boucher, I was so excited after seeing his scouting and videos. Then I saw his age and was hugely disappointed. At that age you should be at or nearing prime. He was raw and years away, but Raptors truly have the best developmental system in the NBA. He turned out just fine"
Chris Boucher is 6 months older than Steven Adams
Chris Boucher is 2 years older than Jabari Parker.
Chris Boucher is 28 years old. 2021/22 will be his 5th year in the NBA.  OG Anunoby is 24 years old. 2021/22 will be his 5th year in the NBA.
Chris Boucher is older than Andre Drummond.
"&gt; And yeah, of course you can pair Ben Simmons with no stars, with the ideal 5 like Christian Wood or Chris Boucher, don't pair him with any ball dominant guys or paint cloggers, give him a team of shooters, and that may get you a 25/10/10 Simmons but also a team perpetually a few games out of the playoffs. Simmons is probably a low-ceiling/high floor player that reminds me of Westbrook.  There are enough possessions in a game that it's possible for ben to have a lot of time onball, while still ultimately deferring to an elite offensive option. I think christian wood, ben simmons and a fully realized jalen green could be a great trio.  &gt; I'm really confident it'll have nothing to do with the fit of his team, if it happens it's going to happen from within himself.  I mean I think the fit matters a lot, but at the same time yes there needs to be personal growth, I agree."
"IMO nothing would cure Ben Simmons because he would actually have to execute the gameplan listed here whereas he can't even be made to shoot a 3 a single time. He's just going to play the way he's going to play.  I kind of laugh when I think about the thought of Ben doing better on a different team/lineup. He played with Butler and was useless on offense in the playoffs and there was a line of thinking like 'oh he needs the ball in his hands'. Then they got rid of him and now it's 'oh Embiid is clogging the paint'.  So let's just pair Simmons with a star who isn't a ballhandler/playmaker/paint clogger. The list is literally KAT. That's it. I don't even think Embiid was that bad because Embiid was ultra willing to stand at the 3 point line for Ben.  And yeah, of course you can pair Ben Simmons with no stars, with the ideal 5 like Christian Wood or Chris Boucher, don't pair him with any ball dominant guys or paint cloggers, give him a team of shooters, and that may get you a 25/10/10 Simmons but also a team perpetually a few games out of the playoffs. Simmons is probably a low-ceiling/high floor player that reminds me of Westbrook.  Thing is Ben is 25 so I think he could play better, but I'm really confident it'll have nothing to do with the fit of his team, if it happens it's going to happen from within himself."
"Here are some excerpts from the article where the author describes how Ben can be an effective halfcourt scorer (make sure to watch the including videos).   **Ben Simmons postup game:**  &gt; When thinking about untapped areas, I keep going back to that game from this February against the Utah Jazz, where Embiid was absent and Simmons went up against Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert. Ben ran the offense through the post, going against Gobert or others through backing them down. He‚Äôd take his size advantage and a cleared-out lane to his advantage. While we think so much about what Simmons‚Äô lack of shooting does for Embiid‚Äôs spacing, we don‚Äôt spend nearly enough time talking about how Embiid‚Äôs presence takes away all of Ben‚Äôs post-up looks.  &gt; With that lane cleared, he could use his length to play one-on-one and his explosion showed. Great touch off the glass, good patience and use of pump fakes, and superb touch with both hands:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xUmbP75Jis  &gt; Size advantages create most of these opportunities, as well as the Jazz willingly playing him one-on-one. If Simmons gets enough volume in post-ups, we know he‚Äôll hurt teams who do over-help and bring doubles: he‚Äôs far too good a passer in every other fashion for it not to translate. As for judging the sample of his time in Philadelphia, it‚Äôs so hard to look at the post-up numbers due to Embiid‚Äôs presence and both Brett Brown and Doc Rivers‚Äô insistence on not exposing Simmons at the 5. If you do, as a scorer and passer out of the post, Simmons was just as efficient (0.99 PPP) as Giannis (0.99), Karl-Anthony Towns (0.966) and Jayson Tatum (0.959). That number should increase with more spacing.  **Ben Simmons pick and roll:**  &gt; As a pick-and-roll handler, Simmons‚Äô violates one of my main tenets in initiating offense: he doesn‚Äôt shoot it. Teams can go under against him and clearly contain him from the lane, forcing him to either take the shot or not put enough pressure on the rim to force help defenders to collapse. Without helpers tagging the role and squeezing the lane, catch-and-shoot kickout avenues won‚Äôt develop.  &gt; Simmons encounters those issues on middle pick-and-rolls quite frequently, where driving around the screen would push him wide and ultimately away from the rim. On side ball screens, when his penetration around the screen generates a paint touch, he‚Äôs actually fairly effective. Part of the reason for that: teams cannot ice screens and go under at the same time. When they go under and try to meet him on the other side, Simmons is so damn lanky and long that one bounce and enough explosion allows him to get to the front of the tin.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hb9C8kvGwQ  &gt; A great breakdown by Shehan here. Note that Embiid does a fantastic job screening his own man here so that Simmons only has one body to navigate and finish through.  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league‚Äôs premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he‚Äôs absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout.  **Ben Simmons in a free-flowing offense based on dribble handoffs:**  &gt; Clearing out one side of the floor just for Simmons to score in the lane isn‚Äôt an ideal usage of a team‚Äôs time. But there are great ways to flow into that action from a 5-out or delay series in the NBA. The quick swings and handoffs from the Indiana Pacers playbook last year are examples of how to get Simmons the ball on the move. Not only does that put him in the situation to play through the pick-and-roll but might catch some teams unable to go underneath screens:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjMTEMUl5g  &gt; Here‚Äôs the catch: pair Simmons with the right team and he can be Domantas Sabonis in the clips above at times, too. A hybrid 5 who has the offensive game of a wing (think KAT, Christian Wood, Chris Boucher) to cut or space while Simmons trails to the middle of the floor would be incredibly dynamic, even if it‚Äôs only for brief moments. A small-ball Simmons at the 5 grouping might be the best way to unlock late-game or playoff Ben‚Äôs ceiling.  There's more if you read the article."
"Gobert:   * Unfair: he can't guard the perimeter. No, he's not gonna hang on Kyrie like he's Jrue Holiday. But there have been plenty of times where he rotates out to the perimeter and contests a shot- he contested 3.8 three pointers per game last year, seventh among consistent starters at center. He's sixth among starters in three-point percentage allowed, despite contesting more threes than all but one player (Chris Boucher) above him. And half the point of having Gobert to to make guys shoot from the perimeter; on average in 2020/2021, teams made 64.23% of their shots at the rim, compared to 36.7% from three. Percentage-wise, you want a giant guy in the middle forcing teams to take outside shots.   * Fair: his offense is an issue in the playoffs. He's a high-efficiency and super strong, but he basically can only score from dunks, and isn't absolutely elite at powering to the rim in the way of Giannis. Defenses can shut him down too easily in the playoffs, you really need someone who can score multiple different ways (Jokic, AD, Embiid) or is absolutely elite at scoring at the rim (Giannis). Gobert is only average, so teams will either throw a guy in the paint to force him into more difficult looks or let him get his easy looks but focus on locking down the Jazz's shooters. Then there's the hack-a-Rudy issue, which, while never as bad as Ben, is a concern."
Chris Boucher. Dudes like 27 or 28 and kinda had a breakout last season. Let‚Äôs see if he continues it
"And Jaren Jackson, maybe Chris Boucher too"

they should trade Theis to the Raps for 1 Chris Boucher
Chris boucher? /s
"Meanwhile, Chris Boucher would have no idea where the rest of his teammates are. Low BBIQ I've had enough"
We'll give you Chris Boucher and a ham sandwich for Jalen Smith
"The Nets gotta trade Harden for Siakam, Chris Boucher, Dragic and a protected 2nd round pick. That will bolster their roster with much needed front court depth and star power üëÄ"
You aren't wrong. but the raptors subreddit and the majority of new raptors fans don't know how to appreciate nuance. I have been downvoted for being down about chris boucher.....    Part of the problem is the raptors fan base for the most part do not know how to handle their team not being top 4 in the east you get used to a decade of a pretty solid good team and then you lose it when you go down for a few years.
"Not sure how much value you think Turner has. Can‚Äôt defend in space, can‚Äôt defend in the post. He can block shots and shoot 3‚Äôs. Basically Chris Boucher.  Siakam has made All-NBA and started the all-star game. There aren‚Äôt many 6‚Äô9 guys that can give you 20-7-5 every night and play great defense. If a team wants a player of that caliber, they have to pay up. Otherwise he‚Äôs not getting moved. Masai Ujiri is literally one of the best negotiators in the league. If he wants to move Pascal he‚Äôll get a great return."
Im a Raps fan and can confirm this is the case. He was well loved originally but he jacks up some ridiculous shots and is just not a smart player. It‚Äôs more of a love hate sort of thing. You can‚Äôt solely hate a guy like Chris Boucher
"Chris boucher, dude showed so much potential on the raptors last year. This year he has been slow to get going and appears flat out lost so just lobs up a 3 in bad situations."
He ate up Dillon Brooks' shot attempt in the Grizzlies game the other night while Chris Boucher ended up on SportsCenter getting dunked on. Saw a good clip asking why Chris Boucher not contesting a dunk is a 'good business decision' while Yuta gets up and tries his best on D and gets no reward for it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spxqhO3u-ok   Tell me you don't watch Raps games without telling me you don't watch Raps games.
"The majority of Raptor fans don‚Äôt overly like a Chris Boucher from the looks of it.   Seems like he would be a fan favourite being Canadian, however he is a black hole on offence and is very much a tweener with the 4-5. His playstyle can be frustrating to watch, especially in games when he is off."
Precious Achuiwa plays like he has ball hog gloves on  Scottie Barnes is just zero calorie Ben Simmons with a personality  Chris Boucher being employed is just nepotism on a national scale
Chris Boucher makes everyone look like prime Shaq
Who do yall think the Mavs should trade for then immediately release Dorian-Finney-Smith?  * Marvin Bagley * Goran Dragic * Chris Boucher * Bradley Beal * Other
From the Raptors: Chris Boucher and Goran Dragic
Chris Boucher went from sixth man of the year caliber great energy big to almost unplayable
Chris Boucher. Was in the running for MIP last season (or two seasons ago) and now he‚Äôs complete trash.
The one guy who I think has potential to really shock people is Chris Boucher. He started playing serious basketball at 19 or 20? Didn't make the league until 25.  He started this season rough and might be done improving but on the other hand there is a chance he still hasn't hit the ceiling.
"Outside of literally one game, Chris Boucher has been absolutely dreadful"

"We already have Chris Boucher, who's allergic to passing"
This game was close until the Jazz realized they were bigger and better than the Raptors. Rudy Gay looked like a difference maker. He killed the switch defense and made every correct read.  Also Chris Boucher is one of the worst players I've seen this year. What the heck is wrong with him?
I just want Chris Boucher to never chuck another three with 20 seconds remaining on the shot clock  Is that really too much to ask?
"You want Goran Dragic and Chris Boucher? Maybe a future pick to sweeten the deal? The Raptors will make Wood look way better on defense than he is, and we just need someone who can rebound and be tall around the rim."
"[Woj] Lebron James has been traded to the Raptors for Goran Dragic, Chris Boucher and Malachi Flynn"
You can add Seth Curry and Chris Boucher to the Warriors
"I listen to French podcasts about NBA and when previewing the Raptors' season they were very concerned about your frontcourt presence. Your depth at C is abysmal, it's basically Chris Boucher and then it's ""who's that guy ?"". Makes sense that Pascal has to play big minutes at C when he's undersized for it"
I chose Chris Boucher over Mobley (just barely) in my fantasy league smh.
"4 lessons we learned about Raptors (and already kind of knew)    1. Chris Boucher is terrible...He looks like a different player this year and the fact that Nurse continues to give him any significant minutes is a head scratcher..   2. They desperately need to trade for a starting center, they are being bullied in the paint and it's costing them defensive rebounds...most of their losses have been within one or two possession and a starting big would probably have made a huge difference tonight.    3. Banton should start over Goran Dragic on nights that Freddie is resting, Dragic actually had a decent game tonight but Bantons energy, defense and ability to create his own shots is more valuable, it's clear that when he's pn the floor everyone seems to play at a higher level...the same can't be said about Dragic..   4. Nurse has to get Barnes more involved in the offence, especially when we are down in a shooting slump, teams are starting to double cover him but it doesn't seem to phase him and good things happen when Bares is driving to rim or shooting jumpers in the post, I suspect Nurse was trying to give the vets an opportunity to pull this one out...that didn't happen..."
"Speaking of missing on draft picks, you guys want Chris Boucher for Jalen Smith?"
Chris Boucher heard every single one of us talking shit
"Much better game from Boucher, especially in the second half. He's been playing like we know he can: following up on plays, crashing boards, defensive rotations. Gritty stuff.  Also, there have been calling into to question his chemistry with Scottie. We can dismiss that with one occasion where Chris hypes up Scottie and one where Scottie hypes up Chris."
"Chris Boucher has been okay - which is an improvement over the last 10 games. He showed huge potential last season, here's hoping he gets out of his head because he seemed like 6MOTY potential before"
When is Chris Boucher gonna realize he's not KD?
Chris Boucher has massively regressed into barely a NBA player.
Could I offer you one Chris Boucher? üò≥
Chris Boucher
"Chris Boucher man only wants to take contested 3‚Äôs like he Steph or something. Literally begs for the ball in hand, always wines when people criticism him for his play. Defence only goes for the highlight plays and makes stupid plays"
"Coaches yell worse at players during games in front of everyone.   Nick Nurse was asked about Chris Boucher this year. When asked if he was too up and down. Nurse said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see any up‚Äù and ‚Äúhe has to start playing better period‚Äù. That‚Äôs just the first example I have as a raps fan. This shit is normal. The Boucher comments are harsher than Ben‚Äôs. If Ben needs everyone to coddle him, again it speaks more about his character than everyone else‚Äôs who manage to be adults and show up to work even when coach is mean to them."
"Right now, Chris Boucher. His shot Whack, BBIQ Whack. Just not playing well and it‚Äôs driving me nuts"
Chris Boucher.  He sucks. The end.  Wait... i mean he could be a valuable adfotion for q contender willing to give up a few youngsters
Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher
For me it‚Äôs Chris Boucher on one of his off days. He sometimes just yeets the ball in the direction of the rim on offense. defense is still great though.
Chris Wood and Chris Boucher.
Those idiots are working over Chris Boucher right now. Our fans can be insufferable as fuck.
What about Doncic for Chris Boucher and Dragic?
"Tbf, at this time last season people also thought Chris Boucher and Jerami Grant were front runners for MIP. We gotta wait at least another 15-20 games before making a firm judgement."
"chris boucher be like: fck, give me some minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  DNP coming up"
"Everything you said is wrong. Porzingis isn't a high potential guy anymore. He is a 26 year old 7'3 string bean with a history of back and knees injuries. He also has regressed since him being Alabaster Ewing on the Knicks due to his injuries sapping the athleticism that made him so dynamic. Porzingis also does not fit our roster better. He would take away from our heavy help and rotate defensive scheme due to his sapped athleticism making just slow on the help+rotate (as shown by his defensive struggles against heavy ball movement teams since arriving in Dallas post knee injury) and he doesn't have the strength to effectively protect the paint (he was primarily a weakside shot blocker and help defender in New York at the peak of his defensive powers). Rick Carlisle also employs zone similarly to Nick Nurse does, using a variety of different types, which Porzingis regularly gets lost in whether that be his sapped athleticism or just not keeping up mentally or a bit of both. What Porzingis gets us at the 5 is someone that can space the floor and fade over small wings in ISO/mid+low post cause even though he is 7'3 he can't back anyone down to take advantage of that length. If we wanted a big that plays more like a 3nD SG, we have Chris Boucher who routinely has his minutes go up and down because of similar weaknesses as Porzingis but minus the clout from being legitimately great on the Knicks before injuries.  TL DR : we don't need Porzingis, we have Montreal Porzingis at home."
we've got Goran Dragic and Chris Boucher and a ton of late firsts!!!!
That dunk he did on Toronto on Chris Boucher is so damn amazing. One of the best in recent memory imo
"Hey, Chris Boucher was also on that squad."
Chris Boucher has never committed a foul in his entire life according to Chris Boucher
"Look up Nick Nurse talking about Chris Boucher, Stanley Johnson and Rondae Hollis Jefferson in the past. That's called throwing a player under the bus.  Answer ""idk"" to a question about Ben's play is not throwing him under the bus. Joel telling the reporter about everything that happend in the last 2 minutes of the game is not throwing Ben under the bus.  Nobody alienated him, Doc &amp; Joel literally said they can't wait to get back into the gym with Ben in the same interview. Ben alienated himself because he didn't want to play.   If Ben actually had mental issues, why not bring it up then? Why not bring it up when he was bricking FTs in the playoffs? Why only when the Sixers started docking his pay? It makes zero sense. If I'm Daryl Morey I'm calling his bluff lmao, sit for 4 years if you want."
Chris Boucher for Jaden McDaniels who says no? ^^^^^^^^/s
"Case in point, Chris Boucher. He looks terribke now without Lowry."
"Chris Boucher might be available, and that would be an overpay for him."
Kendrick Nunn and Chris Boucher came through SC as well
No like I said the impact stats don‚Äôt hold. Unless you think Mike Conley is more impactful than all those players. Or that Chris Boucher is more winning then Curry.
"Chris Boucher?   He averaged 14/7 with 2 blocks last year, shooting 38% on 3 Pt attempts a year last year.   Not sure how you think Jalen Smith is close to being able to do that. Jalen Smith looks like he is probably going to get cut and then sign with a G-League team and try and crack another teams roster pretty soon."
"Zion, Kuzma, Chris Boucher, Coby White &amp; Mikal Bridges are +5000 each to win the 2022 MIP award."
He's everywhere. Rich man's Chris Boucher.
Lakers should trade for Chris Boucher
No way are we trading Dalano. I‚Äôd do Mo Bamba for Chris Boucher straight up.
"Game Notes   - Scottie Barnes may arguably be the best rookie in the league, but Dalano Banton might be the best 2nd rounder.   - Suggs is the truth. Stop hating on that young man. Almost beat our ass single-handedly   - Dragic getting no PT is great for the team. Let our young guys develop.   - Gary Trent Jr is scary when he gets to the rim, and these steals are amazing (averaging 2.5 on the season!)   - Chris Boucher finally had a good game.   - Mo Bamba is officially good at basketball this season.   - Cole Anthony will be the bane of our existence one day (DJ Augustin vibes)"
naybe like a chris boucher for coby white type deal
Coby White for Chris Boucher send it in Masai
Chris Boucher refuses to let us choke this game
over Chris Boucher? don't think so
Chris Boucher is the best player I've ever seen
We just like to dig ourselves a nice deep hole before bringing in our star player Chris Boucher to bail us out
he wishes he was chris boucher
"Yeah, you guys have reason to be optimistic for sure. Jaylen's looking like the real deal and Jayson has improved a lot even from last year. With TT your rebounding is also much better than last year, too.  This was going to be a bum season for us anyway; both of our main bigs suck and outside of Pascal we don't really have any rebounding, and that's not even mentioning the team being unable to play at Scotiabank. Still, we've got things to look forward to; Pascal's looking like himself again and has gotten a lot better at impacting the offense when his shot isn't falling and holy shit Chris Boucher."
"&gt; Would the Raptors be better off if they had Casey‚Äî a proven development coach‚Äî post-Kawhi?  OP is forgetting the entire emergence of Siakam and FVV under Nurse. Throw in OG and even Chris Boucher so far.  Though credit where credit is due, Casey definitely did seem to bring out a lot from all of our young guys, though its tough to tell how much credit the org as a whole or Kyle Lowry deserves in that (for both Casey and Nurse)"
Not while Chris Boucher exists
Chris Bosh  Chris Boucher  Its an evolution.
"Not if Chris ""The Saviour"" Boucher has anything to say about ut"
Chris Boucher aside I think its best we never learn what Don‚Äôs true feelings about a primarily black sport are
He must be fuming about how well Chris Boucher is doing then.
COTY - Nate Bjorkgren  MIP - Christian Wood  6MOTY - Chris Boucher   ROTY - Tyrese Haliburton   DPOY - Joel Embiid   MVP - I have no clue rn  Philly trades for Kyle Lowry and make it to the Finals but lose to the Lakers in 6 games.
Losing to a 2-8 raptors team with Chris Boucher as their best player is a pretty crushing L for Charlotte lol

Put some respect on DPOY and MVP and MIP and 6MOTY Chris Boucher
If Chris Boucher bulks up like Giannis...
"Chris wasn't given a chance against the 76ers. He was never on the floor when Embiid  was on, and Howard got zero points. Boucher finished with +3 and only given 4 mins, while Baynes and Len were eaten alive by Embiid.  To say he's up and down is ridiculous considering his effenciency this year has been phenomenal and he's playing more minutes than last year."
"Impressive also to me is Chris ""TreBuchet"" Boucher is the highest Center and ahead of all Centers by a larger margin."
"Chris Boucher, have a nice day"
"Lamelo Ball is listed at 6 foot 8. Chris Boucher is listed at 6 foot 9.  His last game against Portland. He had 3 blocks. One on Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Jones Jr. none of whom are 5"" shorter.  The last block he had on anyone more than 5"" shorter than him was his last block in Golden State on Steph Curry."
Put some respect on DPOY and MVP and MIP Chris Boucher
Anthony Davis is just a poor man's Chris Boucher
"chris boucher, a joke created by the basketball gods that went too far"
Put some respect on DPOY and MVP Chris Boucher
"Chris Boucher is probably my winner for ""best player who doesn't look like he can play basketball"" award. For a long time it was Joakim Noah."
No love for Chris Boucher in the PGT thread title.
Chris Boucher doesn't give a fuck about draft picks and nor should he because he went undrafted.

It's very confusing that Chris Boucher has been our best player so far this year by basically any metric.

Hey has anyone actually checked to make sure that actually *is* Chris Boucher and not just Kevin Durant wearing his face?
JESUS CHRIST CHRIS BOUCHER
Little did we know Chris Boucher is actually the 2nd coming of Kevin Durant
Haha thanks. Everyone wants Jarrett Allen who would be a decent combo with Chris Boucher but it would also be nice to not be good this yr and get a prospect. Will depend on if Lowry wants out...
"1. We've blown a lot of double-digit leads.  2. At the start of the season Siakam struggled a lot.  He's playing way better now, and although it hasn't translated to wins, the team (at least the starting lineup) is looking better.  3. We have big problems at centre.  Ibaka and Gasol left which has had a huge impact, Baynes and Len have been hot garbage and borderline unplayable, Chris Boucher has been very good but he isn't really a true 5.  4. We have no bench.  Norm Powell has struggled a lot (wild shooting splits of 43% on 3PAs and 31% on 2PAs), Boucher has been good off of the bench but if Baynes and Len are this bad then you might need to start Boucher.  Nick Nurse has Terence Davis and Matt Thomas (especially Matt Thomas) on super short leashes, I'm assuming because of defense, which means they're barely playing.  Malachi Flynn has only seen real minutes in three games, two of which he didn't do much and one which he played well.  TLDR: Stanley Johnson is getting consistent rotation minutes, which should tell you all you need to know about the Raptors rotation problems at the moment."
"I dunno... Last time I saw him, he was slimmer than Chris Boucher, without the rim protection or screen setting."
Chris Boucher is winning at least one MVP before it's all over.

My boy Chris Boucher is ranked #10 overall haha
But Chris Boucher birthday party is tomorrow night
Chris Boucher would like a word.
No playable Center on the roster. Chris Boucher has been playing really well but he‚Äôs more of a PF. Our bench has been extremely inconsistent. And we also have been shooting way too many 3‚Äôs and not attacking the basket enough.
Chris boucher inhaled klay's energy for this season
But Chris Boucher birthday party is ruined
Pascal fucking ruined Chris Boucher birthday what a dick
"As an Oregonian living in Toronto, Chris Boucher is my pride  but when will we win :("
Chris Boucher is the real star of this stretch tbh
Chris Boucher
Inconsistent af. Only good 1v1   Terrible at team defense for majority of his career.. why you think he never gets minutes last year that even RHJ gets minutes over him. Chris Boucher over him last year too
Has anyone checked if Chris Boucher was willing to play 48 minutes a night?

"Some nights he‚Äôs Kevin Durant, some nights he‚Äôs Chris Boucher"
Chris Boucher
"Terry trotting out Kanter to face super mobile, center 3.0 tyradactal-ass Chris Boucher is the most Stotts shit ever jfc"
"We went from one of the best center rotations in the league to Alex Len and Aron Baynes, with both of them falling out of our rotation already. That‚Äôs pretty bad on its own.          Pascal has been playing better, but there is also lack of scoring talent on that team. Fred, Kyle, Pascal and Chris Boucher are the only reliable scorers in the entire squad.           I think Raptors will be in lottery this year."
I would venture to say he‚Äôs playing himself into largely the same player he was last season which is a good thing. He‚Äôs a good and impactful player on both ends but he‚Äôs not someone who scores at will. He‚Äôs still terribly miscast as a first option.  Siakam sucked in his first 4 games but even at his worst he has been far from the team‚Äôs biggest problem.   Now that we are 10 games in we can say confidently the lack of an NBA level center on the team is the main reason we suck.  All we have is Chris Boucher who is skinny af
Aron Baynes and Alex Len*  Chris Boucher has actually been legit
i mean they were the second best team in their conference last year. them being bad isn‚Äôt a product of losing Kawhi but Pascal forgetting how to play and replacing their centers with Aron Baynes and Chris Boucher
Chris Boucher
FUCK IT Chris Boucher MIP AND 6MOTY  PASS IT ON

Chris Boucher if he keeps it up
Sure  Shoutout to Chris Boucher and Jarred Vanderbilt! They‚Äôve been killing it lately
"Surprising: Chris Boucher. Dude is #4 in the nba in PER, Giannis is #3, Curry is #5. 13 pts, 2 blocks, contests everything, hits 3's, he has been a pleasant surprise.  Disappointing: Aron Baynes. Holy hell. Dude can't make layups this year, let alone 3's. He's had trouble catching the ball, hasnt grabbed a ton of rebounds either. I expected him to be a serviceable starter playing 20-30 mins, but he doesnt even look good enough to play off the bench right now."

Chris Boucher MVP
"Pascal has not been our problem. He hasn't always been the solution, but his floor has been decent. What we're missing is play-making, defensive execution and contributions from role players. Seriously, Chris Boucher has easily been one of our four best players, which is nice and all, but that's not his role. Baynes and Anunoby don't have to be stars, but they need to be... *something*."
Chris Boucher is my dad  And FVV has been worth every penny so far
When asked about Chris Boucher after the game Nick Nurse had this to say  *IF HE DIES HE DIES*
Chris Boucher Fan Cam
Chris Boucher gonna win the starting spot and win MIP
holy fuck that was perfect D and rotation until Chris Boucher just leaps on a close out where the guy wasn't even pumpfaking. This is the type of shit that must drive Nurse nuts lmao
Chris Boucher is our best player on the court right now. That's something I never imagined I'd say.....
"There's also been almost no production outside of Fred/Pascal/Kyle/OG on either side of the ball.  Chris Boucher has shown flashes in a few games, is all.   Bench productivity is one of the worst in the league, which you can't have when Siakam has been struggling offensively in all but one game."
"It‚Äôs not entirely on birthplace ‚Äî Zubac and Bojan Bogdanovic are both (correctly) listed under Croatia but were both born in Bosnia&amp;Herzegovina. However, both are Croats and play for the Croatian national team, so it‚Äôs certainly correct to list them under Croatia.  That makes me think - has Chris Boucher never played for Team Canada? That could explain why this wasn‚Äôt caught earlier and why he‚Äôs not listed under Canada. Or did the author merely seek to make the ‚Äúnumber of countries‚Äù bigger.  Also, has Argentina annexed some land to the West of the Andes? Because that wasn‚Äôt Argentina last time I checked."
"So this is based on what country they were born in and not what country they identify in.   I say this because Kyrie is listed for Australia, as well Chris Boucher is listed for St. Lucia. Despite both being raised in other countries, with citizenship in the new countries."
I'd just like to add that Chris Boucher has 14 blocks as well.  Not bad for a 200 pound matchstick.
"No. Don't throw Boucher in with those two. He has been one of our best players so far and our only reliable bench piece. Look at his contract and his production - Chris Boucher is absolutely part of the solution, not part of the problem."
you know what's not promising? Our best big is chris boucher
Idk why Chris Boucher doesn‚Äôt start
But but laker fan told me he was a rotation player so why doesn‚Äôt he play well in every single game with no variance?  Also ignore Norman Powell Chris Boucher and OG
"shit, forgot two  Chris Boucher   Lu Dort"
"Most people grow up playing baseball in the summer here. And the Jays were wildly popular in the 90s with back to back World Series.   But I‚Äôd say we have better basketball players than baseball players right now. Thanks to Vince Carter‚Äôs popularity in the 2000‚Äôs and with the Raptors recent championship and 7 year run there‚Äôs way more to come.   Outside of our Lord and Saviour Steve Nash there‚Äôs:   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Chris Boucher, and  Kelly O to name a few.   We the north!"
I wish he had the same mentality as Chris Boucher. Boucher could miss 10 3-pointers in a row and he'd still take the 11th with 100% confidence that it'd go in.
Your center Chris Boucher is playing exceptionally well
"Vanvleet has been fine. Our problem is our best big, by far (like 100000x) has been Chris Boucher.   We are really missing Ibaka right now."
This dude is being outplayed by Chris Boucher. Not sure what‚Äôs going on with him. He looked bothered when he plays.
Him and Chris Boucher actually swapped bodies and this is a freaky friday situation
Zion could lose an entire chris boucher worth of weight and still be bigger than Ingram
Thats G League MVP (and DPOY) Chris Boucher!
Chris Boucher more points than Zion and Steven Adams combined lmao
Chris Boucher is really really good. He needs to play more with Siakam despite what we give up on the glass.
"Fun Fact Chris Boucher is older than Steven Adams.  Boucher: 27 years January 11, 1993  Adams 27 years July 20, 1993"
Chris Boucher is so skinny that he looks like he flops but he is just getting knocked around a lot.
"DeMar might have the most underrated posters ever  Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Rubio, past Butler and then on prime Noah, TT, Singler the GOAT, Mozgod, pushes it to OT over Tolliver  I think Butler might be a better finisher but DeRozan is more explosive and not that far off"
"I mean to be fair, as a Raptors fan, isn't that hypocritical when Matt does the same thing with Chris Boucher? I swear almost every Boucher's highlight has Matt yelling, ""BONJOUR!"""
"French is one of our official languages and Chris Boucher is actually French Canadian. Feels different when it's actually part of our country's culture and language. He didn't/doesn't say ""bonjour"" for Serge and Pascal. And Jack says ""Hello!"" for everyone else."
