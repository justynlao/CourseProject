He's got an all-around game that'll get sweeter and sweeter with more experience. His stuggles so far have been concerning though. Never thought he'd be worse so far than countrymen Theo Maledon and Franky Smokes.
"We also got their 34th overall that draft, Theo Maledon. So just barely not a late a first. And he looks like a super solid contributor already. Seems like a solid return. Green was an expiring and we had absolutely no use for him, other teams can see that, and unfortunately it's going to lower his value a bit unless a bidding war breaks out, and I can't see that happening for Danny Green."
"He got pick 34 too which turned out to be Theo Maledon so that‚Äôs a great acquisition, along with a first rounder in 2025. He did well"
"Xavier Tillman, Desmond Bane, and Theo Maledon were all on the board  Flynn never made sense and I'll die on that hill. feelsbadman."
"He's always listed as out due to ankle injury. Also our rookie Theo ""Tony Parker"" Maledon has been showing up."
I thought he was a second rounder tbh. I also thought Theo Maledon and Tyrell Terry were locks for round 1
Dort got Hardened this time around but who cares  THEO MALEDON BREAKOUT PARTY
"I think he's been more diverse than his reputation might suggest when it comes to his proclivity for freak athletes. He's also targeted and valued players in the draft like Cam Payne, Domas Sabonis, Mitch McGary, Alex Abrines, Poku, Theo Maledon etc etc."
"Uh...what? Anthony Edwards has been like...the worst player in the league. Like, worse than Theo Maledon, and he looks *so* far away from being ready.   Vassell, Ball, and Haliburton have been 1-2-3 in some order."
"Off the top of my head, couldn't tell you who Theo Maledon is and where does he play"
Watch Theo maledon when he comes in. He plays like a young Tony Parker and plays offense like Dort plays defense... he‚Äôs so intentional with every move he makes with and without the ball!
"OKC Fan: I fucking love this team. Dort is a reddit darling and MIP candidate. Shai is the super star you build around. Baze is still only in his second year and getting better. Theo Maledon looks like he should have been a top 20 pick. Poku is a meme lord atm but has a crazy ceiling.   I'd argue every player on the squad sans Horford and Hill are underrated. Even Roby and Kenny ""hustle"" Williams are actual NBA players.   With the situation we're in (picks for days) we're the least applicable team for this hypothetical. Reading though this thread though I'd LOVE to have some of these guys people are giving up on.   Colby White, Lauri Markennen (sp), Wendell Carter Jr... Bulls you want to go for the playoffs?... Have Hill and Horford.   &amp;#x200B;  John Collins... He'd be awesome in OKC.   &amp;#x200B;  Bagley. Kings WANT to be good. George Hill and Muscala for Bagley?"
Theo Maledon is a poor mans Chris Paul   Poku is a poor man
"You saw why during the game. Theo Maledon (backup PG for OKC), who‚Äôs built like a twig and has below average lateral quickness, got pancaked on every screen. Dort is pretty much the polar opposite in terms of athleticism and physical attributes."
"Theo Maledon is back to back MVP in 2026-27 and I went to two consecutive Finals (losing to Darius Garland and Emoni Bates' Chicago), but was fired by OKC for going deep into the luxury tax.  10/10 would exceed luxury tax again."
Leave my guy Theo Maledon out of this
Theo Maledon looking solid for a 34th pick or whatever he was lol
i guess i was wrong about ja but lamelo ball should not have 100 times more appearances than theo maledon when theo has arguably been playing better than lamelo
ESPN is always useful to test. Especially when it comes to their Ball obsession:  Boban Marjanovic: About 2.490 results  Shai Gilgeous Alexander: About 3.040 results Alex Caruso: About 7.880 results Ja Morant: About 35.000 results   Lamelo Ball: About 80.900 results  Tyrese Haliburton: About 2.820 results Anthony Edwards: About 43.100 results James Wiseman: About 34.800 results Theo Maledon: About 422 results Killian Hayes: About 1.150 results
Theo Maledon stans rise up üó£Ô∏è
"I anticipated that rebounding would be an issue like it has been throughout the season, but that‚Äôs not a stat I want to give up too often as a young team. The execution, the defense, etc, and other things I‚Äôm perfectly ok failing, but hustle plays like that I wish we can see more. Can‚Äôt let Cole Anthony get an offensive board like that.  I hope to see some different offensive sets. It feels like we rely a bit too much on individual brilliance. It‚Äôs early in the season with a new roster so the chemistry might not be there, and that‚Äôs completely understandable. However, I do hope to see some cuts and off-ball actions a little more, especially for bouncy young guys like Diallo and Bazley a la Westbrook lobs to Roberson. The offensive felt a little one-dimensional and there are just so many spread pick and rolls and pops you can learn with Diallo, Pokusevski, and Kenrich Williams. As the young guys develop more offensive feels, perhaps we can see some more of that, maybe double screen up top with Bazely sipping to the rim and Horford popping.  A little fortunate regarding Orlando's shooting. Yes, they were missing Fournier but they couldn't hit anything. Definitely got away with that one.  WE HIT OUR FREE THROWS HALLELUJAH, a bit of a regression to the mean after being ranked last in the league coming into the game. Speaking of regression to the mean, I kinda fear that such is going to happen sooner than later to Lu Dort and Mike Muscala‚Äôs three-point stroke. Hopefully, they prove me wrong.  Theo Maledon masterclass here. The rook guided an often not-so-good Thunder second unit almost singlehandedly. That sling pass from his left hand to the corner to set up a Diallo three was just too sweet.  Darius Bazley heard me talking trash and proved me dead wrong today. Played hard in every aspect, shot the ball well, another double-double, and played some phenomenal defense. If he continues to do this, he will be one of the best young 3-and-D forward, which is hard to come by nowadays. Player of the game easily.  George Hill continues to be a steady veteran presence who took over for a little bit in the third quarter to help the stagnant offensive. Al Horford made some huge plays at the end to put the game to an end. With the presence of Horford, the rim protection took a noticeable boost as well.  Diallo disasterclass. I don‚Äôt want to see this take another step back mid-range jumper again. I am not a fan of him being tasked with running the offense more when we have three point guards - that‚Äôs just not gonna be his role in the NBA.  Kenrich Williams is trying his best to give minutes to Justin Jackson.  Pokusevski also had a pretty rough outing, but unlike the other two above, zero worries about him at the moment.   Sad to see Isaiah Roby not get any minutes but it wasn‚Äôt really a great matchup for him.   Nonetheless, the Thunder just played solid basketball for 48 minutes and beat a team that is on a roll, given they are missing their best offensive weapon. We competed hard and looked like a completely different team than the one that got blown out by the Pelicans. Hopefully, we find some more consistency and continue to surprise some folks in the league. Thunder up!"
"I'm just over here saying ""Theo Maledon looking like a steal in the draft."""
"Sometimes tougher to tell how good guys are in other professional leagues sometimes.  Are they really good or just really good vs. that level of competition?  At least with NCAA guys, you have a ton of players you can compare them to.  And guys like Theo Maledon played in Euroleague, which means you can compare them to more high level players.  I gotta say, he looked pretty bad in preseason.  I watched Detroit in preseason and his handles looked pretty rough.  Seems like the NBA guys that had him as a late lotto pick were more right than the blogosphere and KOC."
That‚Äôs weird Theo Maledon has üòà
"They actually had his draft rights. Process Sixers drafted-and-stashed him, and OKC acquired the draft rights in the Horford deal along with the rights to Theo Maledon. I was wondering if they'd ever bring Micic over - glad they will."
"Five days ago, we had this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mj17mn/brandon_rahbar_theo_maledon_and_aleksej/  ""Theo Maledon and Aleksej Poku≈°evski are the first pair of teammates in NBA history under the age of 20 to score 20+ in the same game.""  Now, it's 25."
A couple years ago Theo Maledon and Killian Hayes were rated about the same. Somehow Hayes pulled way ahead and became a top ten pick and Maledon fell to the second round. But somehow Maledon seems way better than Hayes.
"Theo Maledon had a pretty nice game too, 25/5/5/2 on 9/18 shooting"
"Sam Presti is truly the best GM in the league, its just incredible how he manages to find talented players. Beside Pokusevski, Theo Maledon is playing great ball."
100%   Maledon didn't want to pass it to him two plays later. Poku was feelin it and had a wide open corner 3 when Theo traveled. But Poku made a dumb turnover the next play. Two 19 year old kids figuring shit out. Gotta be teammates first.
And fellow 19 year old Theo Maledon also had 25 points to go along with 5 assists and 5 rebounds. First time in NBA history that two teammates under the age of 20 have both scored at least 25 points in the same game.
Him and Theo Maledon combined for 50 points tonight. Two 19 year olds both scoring 25 points in the same game for the same team? Futures bright boys
"Bey and Stewart are going to be big contributors in this league for a long time. They have been BALLIN.   I also really like Kira Lewis, Okeke, Theo Maledon, Poku, Bane and Mcdaniels. This draft was deeper than expected."
"That, but I mean guys like kenrich Williams and svi. We also got a steal in Theo maledon, and poku has great potential"
"Theo Maledon, Dwayne Bacon, Isaac Okoro, Darius Bazley, Aron Baynes"
"No, it is literally Theo Maledon. Both him and Hayes played together for France and Tony Parker chose to mentor Maledon. I've asked French fans on reddit and they have said that Maledeon has always been the better player, just that GMs thought Hayes had a better potential. Personally I think Hayes was picked far too high, especially when he was picked above Haliburton. Also, Parker himself says that Maledon should have been a top 10 pick.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2020/12/05/tony-parker-theo-maledon-should-have-been-a-top-10-draft-prospect/amp/  Point is fuck Hayes, Maledon is the real deal."
I see you haven't heard of Theo Maledon
"I don‚Äôt know about all time, but 538 has JW as the worst player in the league by their total RAPTOR ranking (-8.9 pts per 100) - about a full 2 points worse per 100 possessions than the next guy (Theo Maledon). If he maintains that for the season, it‚Äôll be at least the worst single season RAPTOR of any player in the league going back to at least 2013-2014."
"(BPM, WS/48, PER)  PG - Theo Maledon (-4.9, .002, 8.2) is worse than Payton (-1.9, .045, 12.8)  SG - Okoro (-5.2, .008, 6.6) or Bacon is a toss-up (-5.3, .017, 9.0)  SF -  DJJ (-1.5, .093, 12.6)  has played 89% of his minutes at SF so he belongs here.  But I'd take KCP (65% of minutes at SF, -2.5, .082, 8.9) as worse.  PF - PJ Tucker (-4.7, .033, 5.6)  C - Aron Baynes (-5.2, .039, 9.6) is worse than Biyombo (-3.2, .085, 11.6)."
Theo Maledon deserves to be on the 2nd team. He's probably the best rookie no one is talking about. Theo had a 33 point career best last week.
"Tanking aside, one could easily argue it's legitimately better for the team to dedicate all the PF/C minutes they can to their many young guys who actually need the PT to develop. And by god, they have so many of them:  1. Developing Poku should be their #1 priority in the frontcourt. Very exciting player. 2. Isiah Robi looks promising   4. Darius Bazley is quickly turning into a potentially great stretch big who can get you 15/10 every night  3. Moses Brown is young and needs minutes 4. They also recently acquired Tony Bradley from Philly, and he's been averaging like 20 MPG over the past 4 games, minutes he needs and certainly wouldn't get with Horford back in the rotation.  Horford is not really much of an asset for the squad, he was traded to OKC as a salary dump for Danny Green. At best, you'd call him ""salary _filler_ for Danny Green"", but even then you'd be disingenuous. The main assets OKC got were Theo Maledon and the future first.  I would argue sitting old man Horford isn't about tanking necessarily, because if OKC didn't even have their pick, they still wouldn't play him much (if at all). Whose young guy from that list would you take away minutes from?"
Is Theo Maledon that player who missed a wide open layup then a dunk and then turns it over the next possession?

Both Theo Maledon and Aleksej Pokusevski are younger than most of the players playing the final four tournament.
"Theo Maledon makes his best game against Chris Paul.  Quite a symbol for him.  At the time of the draft, everyone seemed to think that Killian Hayes would have a better impact in the NBA than Theo Maledon.  Here in France, many observers thought the opposite.  It's only their first year, but I think Theo has everything to make a better career."

They are basically doing that this season and already probably won too many games to get as high of pick they wanted.   This team could have fought for the 10th seed if they weren't resting everyone and played rotations that actually made sense.   SGA developed into a fringe all-star. Dort is a solid NBA starter that would be in any teams rotation. And Poku doesn't look completely lost anymore. Theo Maledon looks like steal in the 2nd round. Moses Brown is basically prime Shaq. Only disappointment has been Bazely but he's still only 20 years old.   Difference is OKC has a plan from the top down. The plan is very clear and everyone is on-board from the Owners to Front Office to the Coach to the Players.   I mean fuck Al Horford has been in OKC for 5 months and is already on board with the tank.
"Nothing personal but he doesn't fit our timeline, we needed the roster spot for a young player, and he's probably gonna lead us to a couple of wins tbh  We now have rookie Theo Maledon and Ty Jerome for point guard lol. Rivers deserves to be on a playoff team"

"Looking back at the trade, okc couldve have asked for another 1st round pick for taking horford‚Äôs shitty contract. In the end they only got Theo Maledon, Vasilijie Micic, and ‚Äò25 pick."
"&gt;Morey's best move, the fact we got an actual player for Horford is a stroke of genius  Daryl Morey (Sixers President of Basketball Operations) trading Al Horford to Oklahoma City, along with a 2025 top 6 protected first round pick, and a 2020 second round pick (Theo Maledon), for Danny Green, is the best move he's made in his current job. Philadelphia not only got rid of Al Horford, who has a large contract and didn't fit well with the team, they got a player in return who is valuable to the team, whilst they didn't have to part ways with an excess of future assets. Morey did very well in making this trade.  I expanded it a little, does this help? Let me know if you don't understand anything"
"Definitely not morey‚Äôs best move lol, and OKC got Theo maledon and a first round pick"
I know Theo for sure. There is a debate in the Raptors sub about whether the FO messed up by drafting Malachi Flynn vs Theo Maledon.
"I think it's a couple of things. Notably:  1) I suspect there's some built in good-will due to the Presti-Weaver connection (Troy was basically the guy who drafted him in 2018)  2) Hami most likely did not want to play for OKC after this season. I'm pretty sure that if Hami had the choice he would choose to play for his hometown Knicks (literally goes super saiyan every time he plays in MSG)  3) The emergence of Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, and Kenny Hustle solidified our bench rotation ball handlers, and it made Hami expendable. Especially because Hami is so damn ball dominant on offense (which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's pretty much the exact opposite of what our offensive system is asking for this year).   With that said i'm kind of nervous how the OKC locker room will take it. It's a bunch of young dudes and Hami was a super popular with everyone."

"I think it was always a deep draft. A lot of guys have came in and helped their teams, even some late picks second rounders.   Pritchard has been great for the Celtics. Theo Maledon has looked very good. Xavier Tillman and Desmond Bane are effective rotation players and spot starters for a .500 team. Immanuel Quickley looks like he's gonna be a very good player. Isaiah Joe from Philly is still very raw but when they needed a shooter to insert into the lineup he played generally well.   And then I think there's quite a couple more second rounders who will become solid rotation players. Saben Lee has had some good flashes for Detroit, Paul Reed is tearing up the  G League for Philly.   All of those guys picked 20+, and then add on Wiseman, Patrick Williams, Lamelo, Halibuton with all-star potential and then Bey, Achiuwa, Maxey from non-lottery picks showing future starter ability. It's a good draft, and there's always going to be late bloomers as well"
"Yeah, I was wondering how SGA, Lu Dort and Theo Maledon could have done this while not in the league yet."
"I saw the tweet announcing the rising stars earlier and was like *Mulder made it over Maledon, really?* But now that I‚Äôve seen this I guess there just wasn‚Äôt enough room in the tweet lol  Both Theo and Dort deserve it, they‚Äôve been awesome"
You left off Theo Maledon my man.
"I wonder why the dunk contest has become uncool while the three point shootout still draws stars.    Maybe you're expected to do something new in the dunk contest when little unexplored ground exists.  Maybe you get clowned for messing up a dunk because it *seems* like a binary, either you can or can't do a between the legs dunk.  I don't think it is binary, but with so many of us who will never dunk who don't really get it ability to perform a specific dunk may seem it.  Maybe the dunk contest is just more likely to be injurious.  Maybe the format of try over and over while we awkwardly watch doesn't work.  Maybe stars aren't usually the best dunkers and Jaylen doesn't want to lose to Theo Maledon.  Whatever the reason is it's getting tougher to draw stars to the dunk contest.  RIP Nique vs MJ style superstar dunk contests."
"The best foreign player this draft so far is Deni Avdija, followed maybe by Precious Achiuwa and Theo Maledon. This draft has just not had made good foreigners."
"He's been the primary ball-handler for the Thunder this year, I think Bball Ref has his position predominantly as SF mainly bcuz he's 6'6'', and both George Hill and Theo Maledon that have played the 2-guard are shorter than him.   If we're going by traditional positions than I'd say Dort has been more of a SF this year, while SGA has played PG and Maledon/Hill have been the SGs."

Theo Maledon looks like he‚Äôs going to be a solid point guard for many years to come  Poku has been not great. He got sent down to the g league and basically has the same struggles there. Not sure what to make of him yet
"""  # Thunder officially complete trade for Al Horford   ## Danny Green, Terrance Ferguson and Vincent Poirier head to Philly while OKC acquires Horford, Theo Maledon, Vasilije Micic and a 2025 first-round pick.   Official release  December 08, 2020"""
"Watch out for Theo Maledon -- he shows flashes of a very high ceiling at times. Only 19 too.  Other than that, I'd say Haliburton, Quickley, and Tate have all been surprising but also look really good. I loved watching Tate at OSU and am glad he is finding his footing. 25 is pretty old for a rookie ladder, but you can't deny he is making the most of his opportunity right now."
He was very hyped up when he first started college than plummeted on the draft boards but he always had lottery talent. He's a Theo Maledon type guy
"Current: Theo Maledon, can‚Äôt believe we struck on a decent player in the second round of the draft  Past: Serge Ibaka, was a defensive anchor for the KD/Westbrook teams and somehow got us Oladipo &amp; Sabonis from the Magic"
"And the Thunder turned around and turned Danny Green into Horford, Theo Maledon (who's getting drafted top 10 now in retrospective drafts), and rights to Vasilije Miciƒá when he comes to the NBA next season."

"Literally none of these guys lead their teams in touches.  Booker ranks 76th in touches per game, behind guys like Delon Wright, Elfrid Payton, and Theo Maledon."
"I see his VORP as 0.7 which actually ranks him in the top 113 out of 524 total players.  Anthony Edwards ranks 519 out of 524 which is interesting. The only players below him are Sekou Doumbouya, Isaac Okoro, Dwayne Bacon, Rodney Hood, and Theo Maledon."

FVV is one the worst finishers in the league. 3rd worst FG% in the restricted area in the league (atleast 100 FGA in the restricted area) with 50%. Only players worse were Aaron Holiday (44.7) and Theo Maledon (42.7).

"We did have PGs. George Hill and Theo Maledon started at PG all season. But SGA is a better playmaker than anyone in OP‚Äôs list (especially on drives), so he‚Äôs a legitimate combo guard."
Theo Maledon
"Who are you talking about as 5, Kuminga? You think Scottie Barnes is that far below Kuminga? 5&amp;6 are just not further apart then 6&amp;16, that‚Äôs insane. And if you think we would even trade SGA for Cade straight up, you haven‚Äôt watched enough SGA lately.   Talk about screwing Cleveland, in the scenario I proposed OKC is giving up pick 6, 16, 4 future firsts, Theo Maledon , AND Darius Bazley for literally just the #1."
"Desmond Bane will start on good playoff teams for years, Saddiq Bey as well. I have confidence Maxey can be borderline all star level one day, but it will depend on his development as a shooter and passer. kid‚Äôs got that ‚Äúit‚Äù factor and competes on defense too   Theo Maledon is one to watch also"
"Due to the shortened offseason, teams can trade recently-acquired players just 19 days after acquiring them.   **I am aware that the following would never happen. I just got a kick out of thinking about it and wanted to share.**  Imagine if Brad Stevens decides to blow it up and does this in a few weeks:   Thunder get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Jayson Tatum  Celtics get:   * Kemba Walker  * Luguentz Dort  * Theo Maledon  * Aleksej Pokusevski  * 13 1sts (the max OKC can send at this point)   Celtics basically inherit the OKC rebuild, minus Shai. Meanwhile OKC now goes forward with Shai/Brown/Tatum/Bazley/Bradley. I'm sure they could improve with free agent signings or other trades, too."
"I just don't see a team giving up a full dollar to dollar value for Sexton right now, before the draft, and when he's extension eligible. It's so hard to properly value a guy you're going to have to pay a max to, who is just starting to reach his potential. He's awesome, I would be so stoked to get him, but I wouldn't want to give up good assets and lock up the salary long term with so much uncertainty. Maybe like Theo Maledon and 2 firsts? Maybe Dort and 18 this year? Doesn't seem like enough."
So‚Ä¶  PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  SF - Luguentz Dort  PF - Darius Bazley  C - Mike Muscala  6th - Ty Jerome  7th - Theo Maledon  8th - Isaiah Roby   And assuming they don‚Äôt grab anyone of starting interest in FA which I don‚Äôt think they will?
Theo Maledon over Killian Hayes all day
"Not necessarily one player but a potential dynamic duo between Theo Maledon and Poku in OKC. Having professional backgrounds, already somewhat developed skill sets and a big opportunity for minutes and development together, I can see them progressing nicely together"
"Theo Maledon and Jared Butler have professional scorer/sixth man of the year potential, Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams type guy. Michael Porter Jr. is a future MVP in the league"
These are his last 15 picks before this draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis Semaj Christon
"Even our boy who is a 2nd round pick last year, Theo Maledon. Outplayed him last game."
I think he‚Äôll get a min somewhere. Get a min with OKC and hook up with Theo Maledon
"Theo Maledon, Killian Hayes, Sekou Doumbouya, Victor Wembanyama, Rudy Gobert."
Theo Maledon played the best game by far. He had 11 assists with a squad that couldn't shoot worth a crap
"Maledon and Shai could be a scary offensive duo if Theo made the 2nd year jump, throw in Dort's defense and this team looks pretty solid going into the season."
Cade Cunningham who I'm here to watch Theo Maledon üòé
 Cade Cunningham vs generational point guard Theo Maledon
We have two young point guards who will be ready in no time with Killian Hayes and Theo Maledon.   De Colo will retire as one of the five or six best french player ever. And the perfect example of a player who could have played in the NBA but maximized his potential in Europe.
I assume Killian Hayes and Theo Maledon will also join the National Team as they develop and the current players get older.
"Give France another star, maybe Theo Maledon and/or Killian Hayes becomes it, and it's possible they beat a young 2024 team that doesn't have KD, CP3, Lebron, Curry, Pop, etc."
3 players  * Gary Trent Jr: Dude is gonna have a full season as a starter after leaving portland * Theo Maledon: Was on of my favourite players coming out of the draft * Deandre Hunter: Gonna take a big leap if he is fully healthy
"Im happy with bazley, theo maledon and pokusevski üòÅ Im also high on giddey and tre mann, (JRE not so much)"
Don‚Äôt forget theo maledon and ty jerome!
"Idk he was just one of the last people cut. Looking back on it, Timothe, Theo Maledon, and Elie Okobo were the last 3 cut"
"Well I said they would be a decent fit not the best fit ever.   Out of the young SGs in the league, SGA would definitely be one of the best options beside Sexton. Sexton would also be an upgrade over Theo Maledon/Ty Jerome"
Why is it that NBA players seem to have no idea what realistic body fat percentages are? Lol no way Shaq is sitting at 14% but he's still probably strong as all hell.  The NBA draft combine said Theo Maledon had 2.8% body fat...
"Kenyon Martin Jr, Nico Mannion, Saben Lee, Xavier Tillman and Theo Maledon all got minutes last season"
"Starting should be:  Giddey (if healthy)  SGA  Dort  Bazley  Favors  Bench: Theo Maledon, Kenrich Williams, Isaiah Roby, Mike Moose Muscala, Poku (probably be starting by season's end)"
"Killian Hayes, Frank Ntilikina, Theo Maledon are all heirs to the throne of Tony Parker  Cest nul"
"I totally get not being interested in Murray. There are teams I think he‚Äôs a good fit for and there are some like the 76ers where I think he‚Äôd be an awful fit. Though I‚Äôm not sure how good he is as a halfcourt facilitator so that could change my mind.  My sense is he‚Äôs a below average 3 point shooter and an incredibly inefficient scorer overall. His 50.9% ts this year tied with Russ‚Äô for 180th highest of the 189 guys who played enough to qualify for the bballref leaderboard. Only ones with a worse ts% were Aaron Holiday, John Wall, Cole Anthony, Darius Bazley, Dwayne Bacon, Theo Maledon, Cedi Osman, and Elfrid Payton. His ts% was highest in the 2020 season and it was still only 52.4% I do know he‚Äôs a way better midrange shooter as well as a better shooter from the line and further from the basket than Simmons.  Brogdon‚Äôs a different story in my opinion. And I‚Äôm not even all that high on him but I think he‚Äôd work better for you guys than Simmons does. And there‚Äôs a fair few other guys I‚Äôd say the same about even if they‚Äôre not as good players in a vacuum."
Theo Maledon is a prospect tho
Theo Maledon?   /s
One good pick out of his last 14 prior to this year's draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is definitely a centerpiece-level player and Lu Dort is a legitimate playoff-rotation-level player.  Admittedly, though, Shai was a lucky acquisition considering how the PG13/Kawhi/Clippers stuff went down. Presti leveraged his position wonderfully, but it was a super unique acquisition that required a lot of other pieces to work out that way.  And Lu Dort was an undrafted rookie who bet on himself and it worked out wonderfully in our favor.  But otherwise we have a lot of assets and not as many legitimate pieces. Presti's done the ""easy"" part really well; the hard work is turning ""assets"" into actual players.  I'm very high on Josh Giddey, but things remain to be seen if players like Giddey, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley, Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, Tre Mann, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl are actual winning basketball players or not.  Presti's amazing, but realistically speaking, he's done well with step one and we have a long way to go before we can call the rebuild a true success or not."
Poku   Theo Maledon   SGA   DORT!
With how jacked theo maledon is...i think theo ate him
"Agree with some of this but:  - The Thunder may have technically picked Quickley, but the Knicks told them which player to select, the trade was already agreed to - Bazley is awful. He had decent counting stats because he plays 30 minutes, but he wouldn't play 5 minutes a game on a playoff contender  - I agree that is a tough range to pick from, but if we're going to pretend Presti is a top notch GM, he needs to occasionally hit on picks in that range like the Moreys, Masais, and RC Bufords of the NBA do.  Here's the ""actual"" Presti picks during that time for reference:  17	OKC	Aleksej Pokusevski 34	OKC	Theo Maledon 37	OKC	Vit Krejci 23	OKC	Darius Bazley 45	OKC	Hamidou Diallo 53	OKC	Devon Hall 57	OKC	Kevin Hervey 21	OKC	Terrance Ferguson 11	OKC	Domantas Sabonis 56	OKC	Daniel Hamilton 14	OKC	Cameron Payne 48	OKC	Dakari Johnson 21	OKC	Mitch McGary 29	OKC	Josh Huestis 55	OKC	Semaj Christon"
Why Aaron Wiggins over Theo Maledon?
"&gt;But also former players voted as well, and they have a knack for liking pure talent rather than achievements.   So any MVP award prior to '81 doesn't really count because they were voted on by the players? And any All-defensive team prior to '15 doesn't count because they were voted on by coaches (many of whom were former players)? Am I getting your argument right?  &gt;I think that awards are the best snapshot we have of individual seasons which add up to the totality of a player‚Äôs career. I‚Äôm not sure what else can accurately portray the level of each player‚Äôs game each year  So there's no way to tell who the better player was last season between Trae Young and Theo Maledon, right? Because neither made the All-star game, made an All-NBA team, or got an MVP vote, so who could possibly figure it out?"
"Or another thunder, Theo maledon"
"Giddey is doing that while not actually being given free reign to play the point, too. Giddey is spending a lot of time essentially as an off-ball 2 guard, with SGA, Ty Jerome, and Theo Maledon all getting minutes and touches on the ball at the point."
