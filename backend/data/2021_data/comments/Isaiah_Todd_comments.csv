"I like some of the mid first round projected talent or even hard to project picks just as much or more as the top projected picks   Jalen Johnson, Isaiah Todd, Franz Wagner, Sengun, Brown I like a lot"
"Sneaky suspicion that he was gonna see limited PT since he hadn’t really played well in scrimmages, and Isaiah Todd is clearly better despite being pretty limited himself.   Was still miffed he went back to play for Gilas though. Probably still better to play 10-some-odd minutes against G-League competition as opposed to playing no-name bigs with no NBA aspirations in an Asian tournament."
Isaiah Todd who was ranked like 13th in 2020 went the g league route and he rarely plays. Seems like it worked out for jalen green and the other top guy though
"Kuminga, Jalen Green, Kai Sotto, and Isaiah Todd. Could be more but these are off the top of my head."

"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"Suggs, Barnes, Mann. And Greg Brown,  Isaiah Todd, Herb Jones, Queta, Wieskamp, Sandro Mamukelashvili if they get anything beyond garbage minutes."
What about Isaiah Todd who didn't go until the second round and Daishen Nix that was a 5\* recruit that wasn't drafted?  Reclassifying happens all the time. Kuminga was the No. 4 recruit last year. Why do you think him going 7 was only because of G-League and he wouldn't have gone that high if he also went to college?
That’s why I think Isaiah Todd was a huge steal
Isaiah Todd
"Assuming starters are Dinwiddie/Beal/KCP/Rui/Bryant, then the bench has Kuzma, Montrezl, Gafford, Avdija, Bertans, Aaron Holiday, Neto and the rookies (Corey Kispert, Isaiah Todd).  It’s a deep bench."
"Wizards got a haul. Dinwiddie will be a hot commodity at the deadline. Aaron Holiday, KCP, and (possibly) Trez will all have value to contending teams as well. Isaiah Todd is a good young player who can help the rebuild as well. If you factor in a possible Beal trade, the Wiz have a lot of guys they can turn into good assets for the future."
"I feel like you maybe only mentioned each of these players' best qualities.  Kuzma and KCP are low-level starters or high-level bench players.  Dinwiddie missed all of last year with a knee injury.  Montrezl Harrell couldn't even get on the court for the Lakers in the playoffs (played a total of 39 minutes in the 6-game series).  Aaron Holiday has gotten worse each year, and he looks to be playing himself out of the league.  Isaiah Todd is a 2nd round pick.    I don't think it's a terrible job by the Wizards if the only goal was to get better next year, but Kuzma, KCP, Harrell, Dinwiddie, and Holiday were all players not really wanted/needed by their former teams.  Realistically, even with Bradley Beal, that team may struggle to make the playoffs.  As of now, they have around the 22nd best odds to win the NBA title.    The moves seem to have been made to make Beal happy, but it's possible they may have been better off moving on from Beal and starting a proper rebuild. This group of players isn't likely to have much success."
It's mainly for flexibility to get away from Russ's contract but it's a weird move. Now it's 3yr/$60m for Dinwiddie. KCP (who is tight with Beal) and Kuzma are the only ones with a 2yr deal from now (and KCP's is only partially guaranteed the 2nd year). Trez and Holiday are expiring. Isaiah Todd might be something?
"It was added to the Westbrook trade, so basically for us the trade is sending out Westbrook Hutchison two seconds and a second round pick swap, and getting back KCP Kuzma Harrell Dinwiddie Holiday and a 2RP (which is Isaiah Todd)"
Through the Wizards. The Pacers got pick 22 (Isaiah Jackson) in exchange for Aaron Holiday and pick 31 (Isaiah Todd).
We flipped it for Holiday AND Pick 31 which was Isaiah Todd who was on that G-League team with Kuminga.  Potential sleeper talent in the draft.
No we already traded Pick #22 Isiah Jackson to Indiana for #31 Isaiah Todd and Aaron Holiday.
Isaiah todd
Jackson has already been traded to Indiana for Isaiah Todd and Aaron Holiday so this trade can’t happen.
Kings would get Isaiah Todd not Isaiah Jackson. Was “traded” 22 to Indiana for Isaiah Todd and Aaron Holiday.
"Brandon Boston is wrong, Ziaire Williams is wrong, Isaiah Todd is wrong, Miles McBride is wrong, JT Thor is wrong, Jared Butler is wrong, Greg Brown is wrong, Balsa Kopravica is wrong. I don't think there are many accurate teams on his list lol."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Isaiah Todd isn’t from orlando and isn’t going to the Clippers
Isaiah Todd!!!
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
Michigan lost out on Isaiah Todd and Josh Christopher and were still the 3rd best team last year IMO
"Isaiah Todd, BJ Boston and Jericho Sims"
Star: Mobley  Bust: Wagner  Steal: Isaiah Todd
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
"From what we've seen, the Ignite is pretty horrible for your draft stock unless you are one of the top top guys, and even then not great.   You play against grown men, on an NBA court (so the 3pt line is further) - your stats are gonna be significantly worse than they would be in college. Your defence will look worse because you are playing significantly better competition, and there are no zone defences or big men camping in the paint behind you like in college.  The system they played was basically 'my turn your turn' iso between Green and Kuminga, and while it didn't really matter for Green because his game is built around that, it kind of highlighted Kuminga's weaknesses, which wouldn't have been the case in college.  I think Kuminga would have been looked upon much more favourably against college competition, where his physical advantages would have been much more apparent.  Also keep in mind Kuminga was one of the *featured* players, and Bronny wouldn't be a featured player on the Ignite. The other guys on the roster basically got ignored and their draft stock plummeted from before the season. Rank 15 Isaiah Todd went 31st, and rank 21 Daishen Nix went undrafted - maybe the same would have happened in college, but they would have had a lot more opportunity to show what they could do."
2 games into the season and Lakers Fans are ready to fire GM LeBron. Kuzman averaging 18 PPG 13 RPG. Harrell averaging 18 PPG and 8 RPG plus role players in KCP and Holiday PLUS a 31st pick in draft (Isaiah Todd).  Wizards flipped Westbrook for the core for an entire team to build around! Lebron was fleeced!
"oh no, they have... Isaiah Todd?"
G League might be good if you’re a Jalen Green or Jonathan Kuminga but ultimately it proved to be not beneficial for prospects like Isaiah Todd or Brandon Boston  I think as time develops there’s gonna be more prospects going to different places to showcase themselves more individually
"That was a **great** move.  We traded Wall who hadn’t played in 2 seasons for Russ.  Russ got his stock at a premium again by getting us to the Playoffs and going on a tear.  **We then traded Russ for and get this, there’s a list :)**  **Spencer Dinwiddie (huge ACL comeback season)**  **Montrezl Harrell (current 6MOTY candidate)**  **Kyle Kuzma (improved in pts, reb, assist, steals, blks)**  **KCP (still playing elite defense)**  **Pick 22 in 2021 Draft… that was then on traded for Aaron Holiday and Pick 31 which was Isaiah Todd**  So in total the Wiz built a totally new squad and the Lakers took on Russ and his ridiculously terrible contract…**did I mention that he has a Player Option for next year LOL**  If we win 50 games, Tommy Sheppard is Executive of the Year."
"We turned broken John Wall who hadn’t played in nearly 2 years into Russ who got us to the playoffs and upped his value.  Then used that to get Spencer Dinwiddie, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, KCP and a 1st Round Pick (traded that for Aaron Holiday and slightly later pick Isaiah Todd)  I think it was worth it for us cause he got us to where we are now lol"
"I’d like to put us forward with Tommy Sheppard turning Wiz around using Westbrook’s terrible contract into - Dinwiddie, Harrell, Kuzma, KCP and a 1st Round Pick….that pick was then swapped to get Aaron Holiday and Isaiah Todd.  So he turned Russ into 5 players who are all great contributors and a young rookie. Plus picked up Kispert in the Draft, Deni has become All-NBA defense level good.  Currently 9-3 record, top of the East, first year coach in Unseld Jr. Held 5 teams under 100 points in Wins.   It’s not a lock yet."
"Well they turned Westbrook, Troy Brown Jr, Moe Wagner, and Chandler Hutchison into Spencer Dinwiddie, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, Aaron Holiday, Isaiah Todd, Daniel Gafford."
