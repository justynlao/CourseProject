Khem Birch can't be Mtl's best basketball player. Bouch out to prove that.
"He tried benching Baynes outright earlier in the year.  It didn't work.  With or without Baynes on the floor, this team gets killed on the glass.  Khem Birch might help, but we got him too late into the year."
"He's like ""I'm not going to the bench for khem birch"""
Making room for Khem Birch
"With khem birch, we'll be back in contention baby! /s"
Khem Birch: TIME TO GO HOME!  *Goes a few hours from Orlando to Tampa*  Khem: Hold on....
"Raptor fans that don't know much about Khem, he passes the eye test for sure. He's big, he's got a motor, he likes to run, he hustles, he's carved his way into rotations since day 1 and has never stopped grinding to get to the position he is right now.   I knew a lot about him because my buddy is a Runnin' Rebels homer, so I've been preached Khem Birch gospel since 2013.   He is by and far, better than Baynes has looked this year since covid fucked him up. It'll be interesting to see what we can do with him now that he'll actually get rotational minutes (which, by the way, in Orlando when he was the designated starter, played quite well; sharing the floor with Vuc did not help his statistical output but he still played well.)"
"I remember watching the 2019 FIBA cup where none of the top Canadian talent played, and Khem Birch was straight carrying that Canada team. Not even joking."
"Baynes is averaging 6/5 on .491 TS%, Birch 5/5 on .517 TS%. Idk about you but I don't think Khem Birch turns this team around. Signing a big is more about making sure OG and Pascal don't get worn down playing out of position."
Khem Birch!!!!! Canadian!!!!!
Clearly you don't know Khem Birch and his tail like I do.
I don't but I like Khem Birch as a player and know how good he is.  So Toronto got better.  Good for them.  I don't hate any teams I like watching everyone so now Toronto is more watchable.
"Its definitely tampering, but nobody cares because it's Khem Birch"
"Yeah, people always talking about Lu Dort, another Canuck, but Brooks is another killer defender who seems at times like he could make a jump on offense, and at least tighten up his 3 and be a real contributor on a contender  After the disappointing passivity of dudes like Wiggins and Bennett, Canada has a whole bunch of bad mfs coming out.  Jamaal Murray, Brooks, dort  + Up and coming SGA,Rj barrett, chris Boucher, khem birch, Brandon Clarke, Nickeil Alexander Walker  + veterans like Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Corey Joseph, Dwight Powell,  Hopefully can run for a silver at next international"
Khem birch is better I assume but I know very little about either player. Cant think of any other plant named competition off the top of my head
"He just hasnt gotten any playing time. Part of this was Vucevic improving drastically after Bamba was drafted and basically being impossible to take minutes from, but I would argue most of it is his own fault. He fouls like crazy, always has horrible conditioning, cannot get a rebound despite his gogo gadget arms and is often injured. Khem Birch basically makes us play a 4v5 offensively and is or was undoubtedly the second best C on the team behind WCJ or Vucevic.   That being said I still believe he has potential because of his length and jumper. But this game was probably his best chance to make a statement in years because we were only 8 deep on the back ejd of a B2B and he fouls out in 13 minutes. Kinda sums up his whole career there"
Bucks in 6  Sixers fans will soon realize Embiid won’t get the calls in the playoffs he gets in the regular season and Ben Simmons becomes Khem Birch in the playoffs
"Zero of the Magic’s best five from the beginning of this season were playing. Fultz is out for the season, Fournier traded, Isaac out for the season, Gordon traded, Vuc traded.  To add onto that, the Magic are missing both their second and third string point guard, and playing an actual G-leaguer in Randle 32 minutes a night. Our bench shooting guard in Harris is out, our starting center in Khem Birch is out, etc. I would venture to say that every Magic starter and backup, with the exception of Vuc, has missed 15+ games to injury this year.  People that don’t watch Magic games think we’re just a disastrously awful team. We’re not great, but we aren’t terrible. We’re just in the middle of an unprecedented injury crisis."
Why did i think khem birch was Indian
"Khem birch is probably the most reliable, albeit unsexy, center on the team and until WCJ and Bamba force Cliff to, he's gonna log big minutes"
Really need to give Wendell Carter more minutes and hope he gets some confidence back. There’s simply no reason to be playing Khem Birch for more than a few very short rotations at this point.
Khem Birch exists!   Edit: /s didn’t know I needed it lol
We are starting Khem Birch and idek who tf the Pistons are throwing out there
"Seriously though, how bad is Mo that he can't start over \*checks notes\* um...Khem Birch?"
One game in and Bulls fans are already wrong about Wendell Carters defense.  The guy is mobile and can switch on the perimeter plus he protects the rim without fouling.  It’s clear to me that his poor play had more to do with poor coaching in Chicago because he was easily our best center and outplaying Khem Birch in Cliffs eyes isn’t easy and he earned every minute.  Dwayne Bacon and the surprise stealth tank of Otto Porter was pretty interesting.  Otto had no interest in defense but he sure did love jacking up threes.
tross isn’t playing. chuma okeke/otto porter jr probably idk khem birch maybe. depends on the day lol
Khem Birch
Tbh Khem Birch would be an interesting option
"If we're competing, I'd want one of Richaun Holmes, Marvin Bagley, Khem Birch or Mo Bamba. All those guys should be within our price range (Raptors can't really match salaries for Drummond).  But if we're trading Kyle Lowry, then I'd want at least a prospect, 1FRP and expiring salary. Ideally, I'd wanna get an additional pick or some decent role players with the returning salary."
Khem birch. We need a mobile big who is very switchable
"Yesterday's power forwards are today's centers basically.    Someone like Vucevic  would've been exclusively a power forward for their lack of rim protection before ~2010. They haven't been wiped out, just moved up to center. In the past, you would've had Vuc sharing the floor with another big dude like Khem Birch or Mo Bamba. The same kinda thing goes for the PF position too though, most of today's PFs would've been SFs in most other eras.   We've gone from PG / wing / wing or forward / forward or big / big   to PG / wing / wing / wing or forward / forward or big"
Can I interest you in a Khem Birch?
"Bamba's in a shitty situation. Vucevic plays his same position and is our best player by far. We signed Khem Birch for depth as an UDFA and he emerged as a decent contributor while Bamba was injured.   As others have mentioned, Cliff hasn't had much interest in playing the kid for whatever reason. So there's already a lack of minutes to go around, and the coach isn't interested in creating any opportunities for Bamba.   I'm hoping we eventually try him at the 4 next to Vuc, but Cliff isn't much of an experimenter. If anything, he'll probably go back to a Vuc/Birch lineup like we saw last season. So Bamba will likely remain glued to the bench unless one of our other Cs is traded."
Khem Birch
Kelly olynyk  Daniel Theis  Richaun Holmes  Hissan Whiteside  Khem Birch  Bismack Biyombo  These are the best guys available that can get signed under the MLE  I could see a world where they trade for Mason plumlee maybe?

"lol, you guys are better off with Khem Birch honestly. Mo is in and out the lineup. Ross would be killer for you guys."
"I can't believe people actually think this. Too strong for FTs? They're just bad shooters.  David West shot 82% for his career. David Robinson shot 74%. Khem Birch, a man who airballed a three-foot shot last night, is shooting 82% on the season."
Khem Birch would be great too
"I might go with Dwight Powell over Brandon Clarke. Plus Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles, Karim Mane, Mychal Mulder off the bench"

"Despite our best efforts, Khem Birch was simply too much to overcome in crunch time."
"Honestly Khem Birch would be good for them, solid defense and rebounding and most of all, effort"
"Do they even have the money for that? I feel mcgee could be a better option tbh if we're looking at cavs centers  Big, athletic rim running bigs are a dime a dozen anyways. Khem birch on orlando maybe? Really you just need someone out there for like 15-20 mins a game out there. You got Jeff green and kd to put at the 5 to maximize the offense too"
It's such a shame we are injured because we are wasting by far Vuc best season offensively and AGs best season as an all around player ever.  Khem Birch is also having his best season ever too.  Just imagining those guys with Isaac Fournier MCW and Kelle is making me cry internally.
why aren’t we posting khem birch highlights
"my man crossed up Khem Birch and slashed past two defenders, future star in this league? no doubt"
Khem Birch gonna have to live the rest of his life knowing he got beat off the dribble by Tacko Fall
"I think it goes both ways. Idk why people act like it’s one or the other. Brook got away with a travel some point in the game, and Khem Birch drew a charge on Giannis while shuffling his feet.  It’s not us vs them, it’s literally just the refs being inconsistent as hell."
I think Khem Birch got his first one tonight
Khem birch slow to react

yes. I suggested this in the offseason. he definitely has potential and he doesn't play there behind Khem Birch who really isn't very good so they clearly don't rate him highly. if you could get him cheapish then do it

He can't beat out Khem Birch for PT
"I'd make a trade of LeVert, Prince and a 2nd to the Magic for Aaron Gordon and Khem Birch. Try to trade Dinwiddie first instead of LeVert even though Dinwiddie is a better fit with higher IQ it sucks he's injured, but if not LeVert. Then DeAndre is gone for literally anything we'd even pay picks for team to take him free. Actually play Bruce Brown at PG, call back Claxton from reserve purgatory and tell Nash to draw some plays for once"
Khem Birch
And Khem Birch
"I think the FO intended to move Vuc sooner, but they weren’t expecting him to turn into a perennial All-Star. But, that’s a very lazy excuse to make for Mo tbh.   It’s not like he wasn’t getting the opportunity to play early on though, he was just constantly being outplayed by Khem Birch and wasn’t very good."
"Canada could have a good ass team.   Jamal Murray / RJ Barrett / Andrew Wiggins / Dwight Powell / Chris Boucher with Shai, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Trey Lyles, Khem Birch is a hella respectable team."
Dude we still cant sign big FAs lmao. Our biggest signing in FA is probably Khem Birch recently
"S&amp;T Lowry to whoever he wants to play for  Sign a center in free agency  Bring back Khem Birch on a multi-year contract (seriously, he earned it, what a showing)  Draft a shot creator in the top 10  Sign Gary Trent in RFA  Raptors do all these moves and they can trot out a lineup of FVV/Trent/OG/Pascal/Birch or center. That’s a pretty great team and should make for a competitive product, while also being quite young when you consider that the bench will have our top 10 pick and Flynn."
This season would be Khem Birch. Really looking like a solid centre for us after being bought out from the magic.
"If we had a guy like Khem Birch all season for sure, with Baynes we were getting consistently out rebounded"
If we had Khem Birch and no COVID this team would be playoff territory fasho  but am I the only fan who was initially on board with the tank and is now kinda sad knowing they won't even sniff the playoffs
"Khem Birch for team Canada as well, after seeing him on the Raptors hes a guy who def adds something. Also Kelly Olynyk has been playing well lately."
Khem birch has been amazing for us
Dude Khem Birch is better.  We should know more than anybody.
Khem Birch &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Khem Birch wanted to fight that man
Khem Birch 👀  This season would be very different if Raptors had gotten him earlier
"So this got pretty long so sorry about that. I’ll put the main numbers first  in case you don’t want to read all the rambling analysis.  Also I’m specifically focusing on numbers from April. Randle’s been performing better this year as a whole and I think he should be at least second team all nba, especially if the Knicks stay in the fourth/fifth seed.  Randle: 27.1/9/6.3 on 57.2% ts (exactly league average) with a 115.6 offensive rating compared to the Knicks’ offensive rating of 116.8 overall  Tatum: 29.7/9.1/4.5 on 62% ts with a 118.3 offensive rating compared to the Celtics’ offensive rating which of 113.4 overall  Tatum’s volume combined with efficiency is pretty crazy. Last month, Tatum was fourth in the league in points per game behind Steph, Beal and Mitchell. Only Steph scored more points total. scoring at least 25ppg, Tatum had a higher ts% than every player averaging 25 or more besides Steph and Giannis. The next highest scorers with a better ts are Durant, Jokic, and Kawhi who all scored over five points per game less than him.  Randle scored a lot as well but not as much as Tatum and he did so on 5% lower true shooting which is pretty big.  The difference in assists is smaller than the difference in points. While I’d give Randle the edge regardless, there is something to be said about Tatum’s numbers being affected by the other playmakers/passers on their respective teams and how it’s affected their playmaking style. Happy to provide some of the tracking data about passes but it mostly just shows a difference in role with Randle being the primary facilitator (and he deserves kudos for taking that on and flourishing) while Tatum plays with two other primary facilitators in the starting lineup and the ball actually got moved around quite a bit more... at least in April lol, we’re still working on that.  Some of offensive rating is just noise but Tatum and Randle both play so many minutes that I feel more comfortable using it though I understand like any stat, there’s more context to it.  The highest offensive rating by a team was 117.7 and belonged to the Suns. Knicks actually had the third highest offensive rating at 116.8 but Randle’s offensive rating was only 115.6 and while that isn’t much of a difference, Tatum‘s offensive rating of 118.3 was higher than any individual team’s offensive rating despite the Celtics having the 12th highest offensive rating last month at 113.4.   Out of all players who participate in at least ten games for at least 30 minutes per game average, Tatum is eighth out of eighty four players in offensive rating and every player above him is on either the nuggets or suns besides Trae Young. If you lower the restrictions to include all players with at least 10 games and 20 minutes,  there are still only 24 players out of 207 that have an offensive rating equal to or above every team in the league and all but three of them - Embiid, Khem Birch, and OG - play on a team with a higher offensive rating overall than the Celtics.  With that said, I’m a biased Celtics fan and statistics can be interpreted in a number of ways. They’re both great players, I just was particularly impressed with Tatum’s offense last month especially."

Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4. Jakob Poeltl 5. Joel Embiid 6. Myles Turner 7. Mike Conley 8. Derrick White 9. Alex Caruso 10. Rudy Gay 11. Nicolas Batum 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Andre Drummond 14. Jae Crowder 15. Larry Nance Jr. 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Isaiah Stewart 18. Khem Birch 19. Raul Neto 20. Nerlens Noel  A few oddities (Gay, Drummond, Neto) but overall not that bad.  -  ---  -  And then here are the 20 players with the highest **BBall Index D-LEBRON** (min. 1,000 minutes):   1. Rudy Gobert 2. Myles Turner 3. Clint Capela 4. Robert Covington 5. Nerlens Noel 6. Matisse Thybulle 7. Jakob Poeltl 8. Alex Caruso 9. Larry Nance Jr. 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo 11. Brook Lopez 12.

Jimmy Butler  Actually a very solid list IMO, Drummond is the only guy there where I'm like *eehhhhh.....*"
"I think a few things happened. First, Vooch really upped the quality of his game right around when Mo was drafted. Second, Khem Birch was more of a quality center than Mo was. Mo was definitely more of a project player, but it seems like the team didn't anticipating needing a ""win now"" mentality when they drafted him. Then they made the playoffs two years in a row, so Khem was getting more playing time as the backup than Mo was."
feels like we haven't got a center that can do that since JV.  love serge and marc but rebounders they are not.  and I fear when kyle leaves us because we have nobody that can facilitate nearly as well.  he makes khem birch look like a beast.

Why tf is Khem Birch so good at grabbing offensive rebounds
Khem Birch Toronto MVP of the first half. We'd be down by at least 15 if it wasn't for him. Everyone else (except for Lowry) has been terrible to mediocre.
spoiled b/c I want Khem Birch? LOL. I'm saying he would've made more sense than going after shiny toy Aldridge
fuck me why did the Nets not go after Khem Birch. Exact thing they could've used. Shiny toy syndrome bs with Aldridge and it fucked them
"when did khem birch become the raptor's franchise player? in all seriousness, he looks good"
"Khem Birch (though I think he grew up in Ottawa), Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Karim Mané. Not bad"
"Toronto's been the 30th best rebounding team all season. Khem Birch and Freddie Gillespie were necessary pickups just for hustle and team rebounding, yet both of them are 6'9. If Toronto can add a true 7'0 centre through the draft or free agency that can actually play then they'll be in a much better spot next year."
"Khem Birch was good for us but was behind Vooch, our one good player.  When we ran Birch + Vooch lineups they sucked, so giving him minutes at the 4 wasn't proving to be a way to use him.  Not sure he is the best example of this, it was clearly a depth chart thing."
"In the eight games since being traded to the Raptors, Khem Birch is averaging 9.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, 1.5 blocks and nearly a steal a game, in 26.6 minutes per game, while shooting 59% from the floor. He's had a positive +/- in each of the last six games and the team has won five of those six games. Other than struggling from the line with a small sample size, he's been a quality addition for the team."

"The Brampton legend bro low key you were kinda disrespectful but it's cool. Honestly I think Brandon Clarke, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, and Khem Birch is a solid front court. Olynyk game is much better suited for international basketball, and I'm excited to see how Boucher performs in that setting too. You'd think his insane blocking ability will reak havoc on less talented role players on some of these international teams.    Dillon Brooks at 6'7 can also slide over to the 4 spot even though he seems to be allergic to rebounding."
Khem Birch looking like prime Ibaka out there yall
"Norvell Pelle, Noah Vonleh, Jordan Bell, khem Birch, Zach Collins, Henry Giles, Alize Johnson"
Stats do not fully capture how bad Baynes was for us this year. He looks like he's performing a slapstick comedy routine when he's out there.  Khem Birch is not a particularly good center and he has made us significantly better.
Meanwhile Khem Birch is +10 in 27 mins. Those 13 mins he didnt play were brutal lol
"But, what about, listen to me, Khem Birch averages 120 ppg for the rest of the season. Clearly mvp in my book"
Hey we now have khem birch so the baynes era is over
Everything. Trade one of them to Toronto for Khem Birch
"They acquired a back-up centre who unexpectedly blossomed into a low-tier starter.  Khem Birch was on waivers. The front office couldn't really put a pin in him and wait to get him until the off season. If they hadn't picked him up, someone else would've, and there was no guarantee that they'd be able to find another cost effective backup. They figured they were acquiring a supporting piece, and they'd get the starting centre in the off season.  If the front office was trying to be competitive, they would have traded Norm for a big man, not a younger version of himself. Getting GTJ was 100% a move designed to lose now, win later.  And as for Lowry, they tried to trade him. For reasons of not provoking consumer anger, they didn't want to ship him off against his will, but none of the teams Lowry was willing to go to could put together a trade Masai thought was worth it."
"&gt;  but idk what their FO is feeling rn.  FO wants to make the playoffs.   Otherwise they wouldn't have signed Khem Birch and rested their good players against the Magic and OKC.  If they were tanking, Baynes would be playing 25+ mins a game."
Khem Birch and Freddie G are ready.
Khem Birch to Toronto 👀
Khem Birch for MVP
Yeah it is. And it looks like Khem Birch and Freddie G is gonna push us into the yoffs.
In honor of Khem Birch
Actually Gary has already made several nice drives and layups which surprised me given the comments that I read from Blazer fans. I’m thinking  it isn’t because he doesn’t have the skill set - or potential - but didn’t have the opportunity with the Blazers. I’m thinking similar to Yuta who once he got the direction from the coaches to be aggressive he was felt free to showcase his skills. Khem Birch has expressed a similar sentiment since joining the Raptors.
Khem Birch set that hard screen up top to give Gary Trent the opening to make that pass. Montreal really representing in this game.
"Yeah, and the difference in opinion is I don't think ""probably won't get a top 4 pick"" is worth teaching our young players losing basketball.  Also, we just weren't a bad enough team to stay there - to get to that spot we had to have an incredibly bad start and lose almost all of our starters, and many of our coaches, to COVID.    With all the terrible shit that's happened, we've never been a poor net rating team, and reversion was always going to happen. I think (and I think by the way the Raptor's org is behaving, such as acquiring Khem Birch) that playoff experience is more valuable than the unlikely chance of a high draft pick, especially when you add in how badly you'd abuse our young players in the process."
"Khem Birch, Boucher, and Dort; three players from Montreal shared the court today, that's wild."
"We receive: Chris Boucher and Khem Birch  You receive: Mike Muscala  Reasoning: we need more Canadians, you guys already get to play in Canada. It’s a win-win."
Boucher drive and kick to Khem Birch
"We grabbed Khem Birch and Freddie Gillespie, so ya Baynes is glued to the bench.  And we're not paying him much, and he's on a team option next year so he gone."
Have you noticed that we went from Serge and Marc to Khem Birch and Aaron Baynes?
Khem Birch turns into Dirk.
"This is how bad he is.  This lineup:  Fred VanVleet, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, Chris Boucher, Khem Birch  Is better than this lineup:  Fred Vanvleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Baynes.  Khem Birch is such an upgrade that him plus G-Leaguers is better than 2 all-stars and OG."
"We have Khem Birch now, you shut your mouth."
I was talking to the boys about how it's weird that Khem Birch mom don't have a podcast yet
"Malachi Flynn. Go get him if he's available. Organization is making a concerted effort to get him as many touches as possible, and he's balled out in April.   If you need a big give Khem Birch a look. He's essentially on an extended tryout to be signed next season as a rotation big. Should be getting regular minutes."
"Donta Hall is my new best friend.  Mo Bamba go to the airport we got our 23 year old cheaper Khem Birch.  I miss you Vuc, but not your defense."
Khem Birch did more in two games than what Aron Baynes did in 10
"PG: Shai, Corey Joseph  SG: RJ, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SF: Wiggins, Dort, Dillon Brooks  PF: Olynk, Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles  C: TT, Khem Birch  7 of those guys play starter minutes. Even if say TT or Dwight Powell don't make it because they're deep in the playoffs, I have no doubt they can beat a Enes Kanter-less Turkey (likely without Ilyasova and Furkan as well) or Giannis-less Greece and no doubt they can beat China or Czech Republic..  With the Olympic games itself I think that team can legitimately get a medal.."
"but there's still dort, shai, boucher, olynk, khem birch, cory joseph  if memphis gets knocked out in the play-in, there's brooks and brandon clarke as well.  if goldenstate gets knocked out or loses first round wiggins is potentially available too."
Khem Birch too.

Could I interest you in a lightly used Khem Birch instead?
"For starters, Vuc's defense is a lot better than Trae's -- iirc, Trae is one of the worst defenders (if not the worst) in the NBA.  And frankly, the levels of talent are not even close to being similar.    Trae and Vuc lead both their teams with 3.7 win shares each.  The Hawks then have Capela with 3.2/28 games, Collins with 3.0/31 games.  The player with the second most win shares on the Magic is...Khem Birch, a former journeyman and backup C, who has 2.1/32 games.  So Trae's next two best players are both a full standard deviation or so better than Vuc's second best.    The lineup that has played the most minutes for the Hawks (194 minutes, this will be important later) this year is Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela.  So along with Trae, you have a 20/10 guy in Collins, a 15/14 lob threat with Capela, and solid shooting from Huerter (38% from 3 on 6 attempts a game) and defense from Reddish.  The lineup that has played the most minutes for the Magic this year is Cole/Ennis/Fournier/Gordon/Vuc.  They have played 70 minutes together compared to Hawks 194, or \~60% less, because injuries have taken out most of the lineup at one point or another (note, we're not even counting Fultz/Isaac who are just out for the season).  This lineup has a rookie PG shooting 37% from the field (Cole), a player we traded the 58th pick in the draft for (Ennis), and then solid starters in Fournier/Gordon.  The problem is both Fournier/Gordon have been out this season for \~40% of the games (19/32 GP for AG, 18/32 GP for Fournier).  While the Hawks 2nd most used lineup has played \~100 minutes less than their most used lineup, the Magic's 2nd most used lineup has played \~12 minutes less (again, owing to injury), and this lineup subs out Fournier for Dwayne Bacon who is shooting a whopping 41% FG and averages &lt;1 assist per game.  All this is to say -- Trae is surrounded by much better talent this season, and it isn't particularly close.  Also, let's pretend everything I just said was wrong -- why should Sabonis have made it over Trae?"
He’s actually 3rd string center. Last season  khem birch was about to go back to Europe when the magic convinced him to stay. Writing was probably on the wall for mo then.
&gt;Or is it because he's just playing behind Vuc'?   He's playing behind Khem Birch at this point.
I want to bring our Canadian boys home and sign Khem Birch and Kelly O next year.
I hope we use our MLE on khem birch or Kelly O to give us some center help.  Bring our Canadians home 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
"No, his value is super low right now. He was always a long term project so it’s in our interest to spend the time trying to turn him into an asset. I would say the earliest possible time for a Mo Bamba trade would be next trade deadline. Given all the shit he’s been through with his body I think they’ll want to give him an offseason to work on his game and come back to stake his claim for being apart of our future. If that doesn’t materialize it’s time to move on. Ideally the magic trade khem birch at the deadline so that mo plays more down the stretch. If he has a decent second half of the season and a summer to work on his game he will become a lot more valuable than he currently is. And if not there’s not much further his value can go down so no downside."

I doubt it. Khem Birch is probably the one they move if anybody wants him.
"Khem Birch, the C getting minutes over Bamba, seems like a more reasonable trade target. Actually somewhat proven and has good hustle and D.  I think him getting moved it's the only path to Mo minutes. But good luck moving any healthy body on this team."
"I was more intrigued by him when the Magic got struck by all these injuries. I wouldn't be surprised if they try to sell high on Vuc while he's destroying defenses from everywhere on offense.  That'd leave Bamba as the only true center on the roster, and only Khem Birch as competition for minutes. He's been catching sporadic playing time since the end of January and he's generally been a plus. I think he'd be a terror on picks and blocking shots, but I don't know if he's gotten any stronger/bulkier to do much other than pray for a block on defense."
"very unlikely we trade Vucevic. a less sexy but more plausible trade would involve Fournier and Khem Birch:  * Boston would get a scoring wing that can be a third or fourth option, plus a cheap defensive C that will crash glass and set screens, without requiring many touches.   * Orlando could ask for Nesmith and a pick in return. Nesmith hasn't logged many minutes this year, Orlando would provide a much better opportunity for him to get on the floor.   both teams win in this trade IMO. Birch and Fournier are both on expiring deals and Orlando can't really afford to keep them. Boston needs some seasoned players to sustain a playoff run, rather than a rookie languishing on the bench. Orlando also needs shooting, and a younger/cheaper player fits their situation better."
"Orlando running an 8 man rotation of Vucevic, Terrence Ross, Michael Carter-Williams, Mo Bamba, Dwayne Bacon, Gary Clark, Chuma Okeke, and Khem Birch..."
"Not to discredit the Suns (I really like your team and coach), but the Magic are down to eight players, and are missing four starters for extended time. Vucevic and Terrence Ross are the only regular rotation guys without injury. Khem Birch is their third best available player. The Magic should loose every game big"
get Gorgui Dieng or a Khem Birch type. This big man rotation is not going to cut it. KP is good on the help side.
"Khem Birch makes less mistakes &amp; hustles more than Bamba, so Cliff fell in love with playing him over Bamba. Bamba also got sidelined with injuries and Covid and has been out game shape for a while.  Can’t say that Cliff hates playing young guys since Bamba did get priority for the backup minutes his rookie year. Cliff also gave lots of playing time to Cole and Chuma this year and handed the keys from DJ to Markelle in a span of few games.  I still hate the choice to bench Bamba because he has shown flashes but he’s just not given the chance to learn through his mistakes."
"I mean Clifford tries to win and Khem Birch probably gives them a better chance to win games right now. But yeah long term it’s just stupid really, if he is a bust he needs to show it in more minutes than he’s getting rn"
"Khem Birch is much, much better right now. Might be increasing his trade value before the deadline?"
writing about khem birch is very on brand
"We are already the worst shooting team in the league, and we were forced to play lineups of two centers, two power forwards, and a shooting guard, that’s the point.  Having Draymond fill in at guarding the center position is a whole lot easier than asking Terrence Ross, Dwayne Bacon, James Ennis, and Khem Birch to initiate and run your offense.   And that’s not even considering asking centers to match up on small forwards and small forwards to match up on Curry."
"Khem Birch would be a hell of a player on your team, ngl"
"Khem Birch would be so good for a playoff team as a backup big, someone trade for him"
We literally have Chris Boucher and Khem Birch on the roster
Chris Boucher  Khem Birch  Oshae Brissett  Anthony Bennett  Cory Joseph  Jamal Magloire
khem birch and chris boucher are 2 current ones
Khem Birch this year  Anthony Bennett as well in 2015-16

So even though on paper Canada should have one of the top teams due to all the NBA talent they have, the results don’t lineup because their top guys don’t really show up. Like for the 2019 World Cup, Cory Joseph &amp; Khem Birch were the only NBA guys that participated."
khem birch was wicked for the raptors
Give ya Lowry and Khem Birch
"Khem Birch, Fred VanVleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam"
"Who needs a center?  Here are some potential free agents.   Drummond, Gorgui Dieng, Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard, Ibaka (PO), Montrez Harrell (PO), PJ Tucker, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Enes Kanter, Richaun Holmes, Theis, Noel, Biyombo, McGee, Alex Len, Khem Birch, Boogie, Dwight, Whiteside.   Noel might have to sign for the mid-level again."
Yes. Khem Birch is very spooky lol
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
Lowry and Khem Birch + 2022 1st round!!!  we winning a chip again!
"If everyone was healthy and wants to play we would have:   SGA, Murray, Wiggins, Dort, Boucher, Brooks, Barrett, Tristan Thompson, Khem Birch, Oshae Brissett, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, NAW from the Pels, Cory Joseph"
"Off the top of my head we have Olynyk, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson, and Dwight Powell. I'm not sure which of them will decide to play though."
"Lol, I do..always!  He reps Canada hard and wants to play each year, plus is besties with Jamal Murray and was one of the early commits last year and again this year too.  Honestly love his game and followed his whole career and because he played a few years of college and was a 2nd round draft pick to a weak team his buzz was never huge.  Showed flashes of promise late in his rookie year by than was injured his entire 2nd year.    He came back and had a great 3rd year lady year and now in his 4rth year he is A 2-way star, or close to it all season for Memphis.  He is a slightly better RJ Barrett type but will eventually get passed by RJ if RJ keeps going the way he is.  It's unlikely Brooks makes an all-star by game, but he will be near that level for a few years in his prime for sure.  He might be our 4rth or 5th main player in Victoria, or 5th to 7th with our complete team including Murray and all out stars.  Clearly we need some bigs to show up an play big for us, but I f I ranked guys right now, he may even be #4 or 5th, behind only Jamal, Shai and Wiggins and possibly be tied with RJ. Than Nekeil Alexander Walker.  Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson would all be very close too.  Than, very close behind your next tier by would be the Brandon Clarke's, Khem Birch, Lugentze Dort, Dwight Powel, Oshai Brissett"
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
Khem Birch did really well with the Raptors this season after being bought-out by the Magic.  I expect him to be signed by the Raps for the foreseeable future.
Khem Birch.
"I'm not surprised. Replacing Baynes with Khem Birch made such a huge difference that it seems ridiculous since Birch is basically a nobody, but that one change made us look like a different team."
Khem Birch was unironically the best player on the buyout market.
"&gt; I just think Raptors fans are expecting a home run move that will put them back into the Playoffs next year but I don’t see that.  The Raps were a 4 seed before getting hit with COVID and were starting Baynes. Fans who watched our games saw how much better we played with competent Cs (Khem Birch and Freddie G). Yes we might lose Lowry but we're also getting a lottery pick. Combine that with (hopefully) being back in Toronto, yeah we'll be back in the playoffs next year."
"&gt; FVV is an above-average guard making star guard money  20m is not star money, I don't know why people still say this. FVV was top 10 in all star voting at the end, and fits the mold for the type of player coaches love, so I can see him being an all-star soon. He's  might have made it this year if we were better at the time of voting and/or didn't have votes split between him/Lowry/Siakam  &gt; Siakam seems to be topping out as a very good, but not great player  Siakam isn't done developing. Despite people who think players hit a development wall at 27ish years old, development isn't linear and he's still getting better. His playmaking took a huge step this year while his 3pt shot was down. He averaged 21/7/4.5, and got COVID mid season. If he gets his 3pt shot up (and gets a bit more luck so he's not the most unlucky player in the clutch) he can easily get back to his all-nba form.   &gt; And they traded Normal Powell. GTJ might not re-sign  GTJ is an RFA so it's not about him not re-signing. Norm would have gotten over 20m, which we likely would not have paid him.  &gt; OG looks good but not a player to build a team around  Agree here but OG's development has been incredible, he had a lowkey breakout year last year. We're all very excited to see him next year.  &gt; Raptors fans are quick to say they were heavily affected by COVID but the Celtics were by far the most affected team in the league by COVID (plus injuries) and still made the playoffs despite the season from hell  I mean, the Raps played 72 road games because of COVID, while also being ravaged by COVID. Sure the Celtics lost more games, but as Masai said today, no team had it worse than us this year.  &gt; Even if this roster works out, is this a championship-caliber roster? I don't think so. They can get lucky in the draft to get back in the playoffs but I don't see them contending soon unless they can swing another lopsided trade for a malcontent superstar.  There's 1 champion every year, and like 2-5 true contenders. I think most Raptors fans know this team isn't a true contender, but it's much better than most think. The Raps were the 4th seed before COVID hit, recovering from a 2-8 start. Also for people that watched the team, they'd know that we looked so much better with Khem Birch. A competent C would have made the Raps a playoff team this year. Also, the Raptors aren't a FA destination, so they're doing something similar to the Lowry-DeRozan years. Developing players, and if a disgruntled superstar comes along, we've developed assets to make a trade."
"That's a silly take. When the Raptors aren't riddled with injuries and COVID they are a solid team, especially in Toronto. The biggest gap in the team, at centre, got patched by just Khem Birch and a rookie pulled up from the G-League."
"To be fair, Khem Birch is an all time great"
Oh don’t even get me started on the Khem Birch love. Letting him go for nothing was a mistake on Orlando’s end
Willing to bet Boucher see’s some minutes at the 5 in international ball. Also y’all seriously sleeping on Khem Birch and Dwight Powell will all the Kelly O love at the 5

"Just some incredible names on that list, but Stanley Johnson stands out. Paul Watson and Jalen Harris probably have outside fans confused too. Now we just need Malachi Flynn and Khem Birch to join the party."
"I'd say Montreal definitely has a large basketball following, you can see that through the emergence of young players from the city (Boucher, Khem Birch, Dort)  I'd argue hockey is still the primary sport in the city though!  If you want to learn more about why modern day Vancouver could be ready for a second chance [here](https://nbatovancouver.com/2021/01/10/nba-expansion-is-vancouver-ready/) is a great article with some comparison data!"
Oh damn you got us. Except Khem Birch has been our starting centre since we signed him and we have a team option with Baynes this year 😂.
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker…. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
"People think Jarrett Allen is the winter soldier lmfao they don’t understand what an egregious overpay it would be to get him for 20 million.   You would the think the Khem Birch saga (6’9 buyout C signs with us and averages 12/8 with a block per game) would teach people that we don’t need to spend that much to get a productive 7 footer for 20 mins a night. Baynes was historically awful but he was the exception, not the rule."
No magic legend Khem Birch?
"2020-21 Raptors, if you use contender loosely. We’d run a lineup of Steph-Lowry-OG-Siakam-Boucher with FVV and Khem Birch off the bench."
Could you give me khem birch please
"What is missing from Canada is also their best players to show up lol like sure Wiggins finally showed up this year, but we were still missing Jamal, SGA, Boucher, Khem Birch, TT. Mostly because of injuries/upcoming free agencies this year but still."
"Aside from SGA/Murray injuries, we need other NBA players to buy in as well. Imagine if we had Olynyk, Dillon Brooks, Oshae o'Brissett, Khem Birch, Tristan Thompson for today's game"
"Despite the roster's wealth of NBA experience, Canada is missing a number of notable talents.  In addition to injured Denver Nuggets shooting guard Jamal Murray, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Memphis Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks, Boston Celtics big man [Tristan Thompson](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/6364), Houston Rockets big man [Kelly Olynyk](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/2041), and Toronto Raptors bigs [Chris Boucher](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/46591) and [Khem Birch](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/11121) are sitting out the qualifiers."
"Yeah. It’s too bad that our best big men were injured or opted out. Kelly Olynyk, TT and Khem Birch would’ve helped a lot. We wouldn’t have had to rely on Dwight Powell so much."
you can play small while having bigs on the roster. did khem birch not want to play? or even better boucher. feel they mightve helped canada’s interior d
"We needed Jamal Murray, SGA, dillon brooks, chis boucher, kelly olynyk and khem birch."
"It's sad because we do, both Chris Boucher and Khem Birch are Canadian, but I believe Boucher is injured and Birch is a FA and didn't want to risk it. Really sucks because we could have used some size."
"He declined for some reason. Probably rehabbing, and given all the injuries I don’t blame him.  Kelly Olynyk and Khem Birch too, but they’re both FAs so it’s a little more obvious why they did. Tristan Thompson just cuz I guess."
"Not to mention Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, and Khem Birch."
"Jamal Murray - SGA - Corey Joseph   Dillion Brooks - Lugentz Dort     RJ Barrett - Andrew Wiggins   Kelly Olynyk - Chris Boucher   Tristan Thompson -  Dwight Powell - Khem Birch     Barely misses cut: NAW, Nembhard, Ejim, Mulder"
How come no Chris Boucher or Khem Birch?
"As well as Kelly Olynyk, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Oshae Brisset, Dillon Brooks and a couple others. Fully healthy this team would be scary"
Khem Birch as well.
better if they start khem birch.
Somewhere between enes kanter and khem birch
"Could really use some front court. No tt, Kelly, Chris boucher, khem birch, oshae brissett, yikes"
"Nice situation to be in, that's for sure. I imagine that Lowry's gone at this point. Lack of a true starting center is hard to swallow though.  FVV/Suggs/OG/Pascal/Khem Birch  Flynn/Gary Trent Jr/Boucher  Not bad, not bad at all."
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
"&gt; Because my original point was about building a title contender and what players are capable of beingthe best player... like Kawhi in 2019. You're literally not following the thread of what I've said. Nobody said those dudes suck or that will better health yall aren't a playoff team. Are you saying losing in the second round is noteworthy? The Sixers will be ecstatic to find that out.  I followed the thread of what you are saying, I disagree with trading Siakam so you can roll the dice and maybe get a player as good as him in the future especially when any picks we get in return for him will most likely be late lottery or protected firsts. It isn't something we've done with our current front office regime and it was a success in the end. And if we trade Siakam for what would amount of some meh first-rounders might as well trade everyone not named OG, Flynn and Green as well and just go into an extended rebuild rather than attempting a retool. It also isn't that likely that we'd get a player better than Siakam with any mid to late first-rounders we'd get from trading him.  Losing in Game 7 of the second round after your All-Star + All-NBA player goes into a terrible uncharacteristic slump after not touching a ball during lockdown in Toronto in a Disney World bubble during a pandemic is the tiniest bit different than the Sixers losing in game 7 of the second round after Embiid gets injured again and Ben Simmons does a playoff Ben Simmons thing.  &gt; are you trying to win a title or just not be in the lottery because that core is not the former and you know it. And that's before getting into the fact you're going to have to pay some of them in the next few years. And that's before getting into the fact you're going to have to pay some of them in the next few years.  A core with playable centres that had the 2nd best record in the league last year. That's beyond just ""not be in the lottery"". Re-tooling by looking to rectify a weakness that killed us this year (no centres), putting whichever Jalen we draft through the famed Raptors development program and continuing to develop our young guys on top of a core that outside of a pandemic and Disney World bubble was an elite team &gt;&gt;&gt; blowing it up cause apparently 27 is too old.  Who would we have to pay in the next few years? Siakam and FVV are locked in until 2023-24, OG until 2024-25, Flynn's two year team option has him locked in until 2023-24. The players that we have to pay now or soon are Lowry who is a UFA, Boucher who has one more year under contract, Gary Trent Jr who is an RFA, Jalen Harris who is coming off his two-way contract now and if we want to resign them Khem Birch and Stanimal. Based on our current contracts and cap holds, we have the 4th highest practical cap space after OKC, Spurs and Knicks so having to pay some of our players who are really just Trent Jr, Harris, Boucher and Lowry isn't a concern."
Khem Birch
Raptors start Khem Birch. Nuggets start Jokic. Imagine pretending injuries are the same just bc they’re starters.
The best overall buyout player was for sure Batum. But I think the best mid season buyout was Khem Birch. He balled out on the Raptors.
They need to go get Khem Birch for real
"Yikes lol, this didn’t age well. But yes I agree, it’s just gobert has one huge weakness. The idea of bamba is amazing, a force in the paint who’s athletic enough to keep up on the perimeter. It’s just he hasn’t been given the chance. I wonder why not, there has to be a reason. No matter how bad these coaches are, they are nba coaches for a reason (not saying Steve Clifford is necessarily a bad coach, just not the best). You’d think he’d at least give him a fair chance once vuc got traded, but it seems like they chose khem birch over him. I just want to know why."
"I like the Dwight finals team. Vucevic is nice for us.   I've always supported Wendell and hope he's good for them.   Shaq and Penny was cool.   Everything else is whatever.  Also I knew Chuma Okeke would be good. Don't care for Cole Anthony. Terrance Ross would be more interesting on another team, kinda like Khem Birch."
"Bro you didn’t even make the playoffs and got booed off your own home court, your team was so bad that Khem Birch was a huge upgrade."
i could see him as a back up center on the Raptors behind Khem Birch if the contract wasn't so bad
Do Khem Birch (he could be a birch tree) and Scottie Barnes (he could be a barn).   Toronto also has a guy named Justin Champagnie (he could be just in champagne).
"Before covid went through the team the raptors were fifth in the Eastern conference despite playing in Tampa Bay with home fans booing them. They went through a good chunk of the season with no playable center until khem birch came later on and gave some solid minutes.  Gary Trent, Malachi Flynn and birch all will have a full off season to settle in Flynn looks much improved.  Precious looks like a solid backup and we will see what Barnes can do as a rookie.  Meanwhile in the list above Toronto is not even mentioned. They are definitely being overlooked, not like we will we will be a top team in the east but to count raptors out of the playoffs is absurd. Huge improvements are coming compared to last year."
"The others just aren't talked about much. There's lots of guys that you just shrug and say ""seems fine...""  Will Barton, Alec Burks, Alex Caruso, Khem Birch, Torrey Craig, Gorgui Deng, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte Graham, JaMychal Green, Furkan Korkmaz"
“Fuck you”  “No fuck you”  “No fuck YOU”  Three hours later you get Shake Milton traded for Khem Birch and a top 43 protected second.
"FVV- very good defender, great at steals and deflections  GTJ- solid defender with good size  OG- great defender, with strength, quickness and discipline, ability to switch  Pascal- same as OG  Khem Birch- undersized but avg defender for centers  Scottie Barnes- projects to be elite defensively, basically a larger OG  Precious- very solid defender in drop coverage and can switch  They will struggle offensively at times but the defense will always be good. Can't say that about any of the other bad teams you mentioned"
"Boucher, Khem Birch"
"Toronto is easy.  Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch  Everyone else is expiring or a project."
I can confidently say that Khem Birch is in fact not a tree.
"Pascal Siakam - lives up this name 'Shock'em' when he takes over games  OG Anunoby - he's no longer a new noobie  Fred VanVleet - not a van rental company with a fleet of vans  Scottie Barnes - not a barn or more  Khem Birch - he could be a tree hard to move, yes  Malachi Flynn - His father Eric, active social media, doesn't think that nn (nick nurse) is fly for not giving his son playing time  Chris Boucher - lives up his Trebuchet moniker due to his unique 3pt catapult-like release"
"Sure, let’s do that. Looking at just the starters for both teams, assuming DeAndre Hunter is not injured, and Precious Achiuwa starts over Khem Birch, the Hawks have an average age of 24.6 years, while the Raptors have an average age of 24.2 years. And personally, I have no qualms if the Raptors do end up being bad this year. We got our chip 3 yrs ago, must be tough having your last chip be 64 yrs ago, and even that was with only 8 teams in the league."

For reference Khem Birch is making 3yr/20m and he's below average.
"Precious has looked great in summer league, we also have Khem Birch who looked very good to end the year. Either might end up starting."
Khem Birch. Don’t sleep.
"Should’ve picked up Khem Birch bro, he was our only competent centre"
Technically 18m. You forgot to include Khem Birch who will probably be starting
Powell always balls out for Team Canada too. Might get a little boost ala Khem Birch playing for Toronto
"Because Toronto is not trying to compete. Center depth was a need just so it’s not a complete disaster but the Raps would rather go young hence also getting Precious from the Heat.   They already acquired a serviceable vet at center in Khem Birch at the deadline last year who played well and brought him back. So they already have a vet that can be a low end starter.  If Dwight Powell is included in the trade, there’s another quality vet big that can eat minutes.  And then they’ll have Precious who will have an opportunity to compete for minutes and develop as well as Brown.   And Boucher will be situational and matchup dependent as I’m sure Precious and Dwight would be.   The Raptors problem was their big rotation to start last year was Baynes and Alex Len who both sucked. Bringing in Khem Birch who was serviceable and played well basically solved their problem. Now they can have him start and play 25 minutes a night and have young guys develop behind him"
"Yeah but Lowry gets a significant amount of dough, and Philly didn't have it. If Philly had the money and/or wanted to give up one of their better players, Lowry could very well be in Philly competing for a championship. I'd argue he'd have a better shot at a title playing alongside Embiid than Butler and Bam. Miami, Pelicans, and Dallas all had more money to offer. But if the Money was right I trust Kyle would be in Philly.  And there's many other examples of people who want to play where they're from (LeBron, Kawhi). Powell's situation is different in that he's not good enough to actually get to have much say in the matter  But I think there'd be a lot of people who'd be happy to play at home if the situation was right. Khem Birch was overjoyed to be signing in Canada. I think that as the number of Canadians in the league continues to grow, you'll see more guys having interest in playing in TO."
"We'd add powell(who i don't mind as veteran presence) and Moses brown to a c lineup of khem birch, precious, and freddie g 😬😬 idk about this"
"His issues are mostly between his ears. He's out of position a lot and he gets discouraged easily. I think a lot of it is just building his confidence and also getting more playing time so he can gain some experience. He came into a tough situation where Vuc suddenly blossomed into an All Star, and our backup Khem Birch was really really good but overlooked bc Orlando. That and this is his first healthy off-season.  A lot of Orlando fans think he's gonna ball put this year. It might be hopium but all the pieces are in place, and this is Mo's contract year so it's sink or swim.  We probably trade him or let him walk if he comes back the same player."
I don't understand how Toronto is tampering if the marquee free agent signing is Khem Birch and our own RFA in GTJ
"Hahaha didnt expect that answer. We have had Cory Joseph, Anthony Bennett, Oshee Brissett recently.  Currently we have Chris Boucher, Khem Birch and Dalano Banton. We are good for Canadian content.  I like Powell but i completely understand why they want more with that 2 year contract (even if 2nd year is a partial guarantee)"
That's what I'm saying - you can't plug it with a vet min and I've seen a ton of people argue that it's possible to do that with the center position.  Khem Birch at 3/20 is a solid deal and it's cheap compared to the rest of the roster but it's certainly more than a vet min.
And what hole are you really ever able to plug with a vet min ?   Khem birch 3/20 is cheap and an example of a guy who can get it done against a lot of teams
I disagree that Demar’s contract is the “Worst Value” but Khem Birch is in no way a third stringer lmao. A completely fair contract.
"Most Improved: Miami Heat =&gt; Bulls  Best offseason: Washington Wizards (hell no, I'm biased but I vote Hawks. Retained all key players and bench pieces, while getting to while touted rookies that dropped a lot and have huge potential)  Worst offseason: New Orleans Peicans (that's fair)  Best value contract: Lonzo Ball, Chicago Bulls  (that's fair or even a slight overpay, I'd say DRose is a better player for less money)  Best value contract (buyout division): Kemba Walker, New York Knicks (seems alright)  Best value contract (minimum division): Otto Porter, Golden State Warriors (also a decent pick)  Worst value contract: DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls (Khem Birch 3/20 is way worse imo, that dude is a third stringer at best)  Best fit: Reggie Bullock, Dallas Mavericks (decent pick)  Worst fit: Robin Lopez, Orlando Magic (okayish pick, Drummond is probably worse though)  Best gettable free agent remaining: Dennis Schroder (definitely right.)"
"Ah yes I forgot we had all star Siakam, Gary Trent jr, Vanvleet, (Dragic? Idk), Precious, OG, Scottie Barnes, Khem Birch, Boucher, Yuta, etc"
"Adding Khem Birch was the only thing I edited, stop pretending you’re some hyper serious detective over the most meaningless shit."
"RJ, Dillon Brooks, Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, NAW, Khem Birch, Olynyk, etc. They won't challenge the US, but are definitely a medal contender if everyone plays"
"Without shoes:  Pascal is 6’8.25”, Chris Boucher is 6’8”, Khem Birch 6’7.5”, Scottie Barnes 6’7”, Freddie Gillespie 6’9”, Dalano Banton 6’7.75”, Precious Achiuwa 6’7.5”, Yuta Watanabe 6’8”, and Sam Dekker 6’7.75”. So most of these guys would end up being 6’9” in shoes, except Scottie Barnes, who’d be 6’8” in shoes, and Freddie Gillespie, who’d be 6’10” in shoes."
"&gt; OG, FVV, Siakam, GTJ, Khem Birch to big longterm contracts tank? With a supporting cast of barnes, boucher, flynn, Precious, and most likely Dragic  Sounds pretty trash"
"GTJ is 22. Siakam was or is apparently on the trading block. They just had a top 4 pick. Khem Birch is a role player. I’m not saying they will tank but that is not a contending team, even in the east. I could definitely see them making the play in or playoffs as a low seed; but Nets Bucks Sixers Atlanta Heat Bulls are definitely better."
"Why would a team who in the past year or two signed OG, FVV, Siakam, GTJ, Khem Birch to big longterm contracts tank? With a supporting cast of barnes, boucher, flynn, Precious, and most likely Dragic.   If it wasn't for COVID taking out nearly the entire raptors starting lineup for 1month + then the raps would have been a top 5 seed last year too.   When you say shit like ""geared towards tanking"" you clearly got zero idea of what you're talking about. Casual bum lmao"
The Brad Stevens / Khem Birch PNR going crazy
"lol raps fans in here downvoting people for not knowing Khem Birch. He was the Magics third center behind Vuc and Bamba until the trade deadline and then played good minutes for the Raps in their 15 games of garbage time at the end of the season.  I like the signing, but its ok to not know who he is."
"I'm always happy to see a UNLV player making it in the NBA so between Christian Wood, Khem Birch, and Derrick Jones getting paid the former Rebels are doing pretty well right now (please ignore the Anthony Bennett in the room). Now just gotta get Pat Mccaw signed on to ride the bench for another contender and get himself another ring."
"I will always believe that if Khem Birch (or Tristan Thompson) were on Canada's team this summer, we would've qualified for the Olympics.  Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles and Andrew Nicholson are fine players, but none of them are know for their defence.  We were abused down low in all of the games.  A tough, physical post defender would've changed everything."
khem birch to toronto
"he’s been injured, playing behind an all star - but also couldn’t beat out khem birch for backup center spot. he’s just not good, we’ll see how he does with a new coach this year tho"
"Dennis Schroeder - PHI      Danny Green - LAL      Andre Iguodala - GSW      Kelly Oubre - GSW      JJ Redick - BKN      Paul Millsap - ATL      Lou Williams - MIL      Avery Bradley - BOS      Reggie Jackson - LAC      Lauri Markennen - CHI      Josh Hart - NOP      Hamidou Diallo - DET      Svi Myk.. - OKC      Khem Birch - UFA (has been signed, Raptors)"
Lol if you say something it’s true!   You seem pretty horny over Khem Birch.
"The problem is the fact that none of the Canadian guys have played much together before. Luka and the Slovenians have played together many times and even with Luka going to the NBA the guys know how to play their role. Canada is trying to make starters bench guys, bench guys starters, and no one knows how to play FIBA/Euro ball. We had no big bigs at the qualifying tournament (we should have kept that Zach Edey long kid from Purdue he was the only 7 footer) and only guard play is strong.   We also were most likely one Czech game away from making the Olympics I think we just shit the bed that game and were lucky to get it into OT. That was without Jamal Murray, Shai, Dillion Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Khem Birch, etc.   They just need time playing together so hopefully in 3 years we should make it."
"When they acquired and played Khem Birch over Baynes, the Raps looked like a 4-7 seed playoff team."
"in the NBL maybe  like, dude is immensely washed, he had trouble finishing layups last season.  he couldn't do it with kyle lowry feeding him, and when we got khem birch, he started doing things that we were looking for baynes to do all season"
Khem Birch is totally serviceable and I think we can get him back for cheap.  definitely more than Baynes in the half a season we had him for.
"I'm inclined to say if the raptors had khem birch instead of baynes for the whole year, they make the playoffs. So I disagree with you a lot. He was awful. I like to use the analogy that Kyle Lowry essentially chewed food for him and spit it in his mouth but baynes somehow fumbled the swallowing process."
"Ngl, I dont really know enough about khem birch to judge. But if these birch and dragic for Powell and young prospects rumors are true then I'll promptly stfu. But yeah I agree - it probably won't even take that long"
Khem Birch stans finally have good news. Rough off-season for them so far.
It’s noticeable to me that no team is interested in giving Khem Birch a cheap 1 year deal to be their backup big
"Same Defensive rating before and after Vooch trade. Thad young is a loss defensively on the interior absolutely. Our perimeter defense is miles better. Temple was injured often and was playing SIGNIFICANT minutes for us. Dude is too old to be heavy rotationally. WCJ was feasted on and gave career highs to a stretch of stars before being traded.   Theis/Thad are the big defensive losses, with FA still going and Lauri still in our pocket if we got someone like Khem Birch as a backup big/Sign for Paul Millsap or trade for Jarred Vanderbilt we will shore up our weakness on the interior for sure.  Pretty terrible take to assume we would automatically be worse on defense when our perimeter defense is overhauled completely and gives Vooch a huge upgrade as vooch is NOT a bad defender. He just cant defend the perimeter, because of our trash perimeter defense he was being forced to switch often.   If you keep Vooch in the paint hes actually an average defender."
Khem Birch
"I mean I’m not doubting u I’m from Canada so I watch quite a bit of Raptors games but IMO in order to make the playoffs the following has to occur.  - a better Center is a MUST. Re-signing Khem Birch should be enough and have Scottie play small ball 5.  - Siakam is the big wildcard as he’s your best player. If he gets back to 2019-20 form it’s a easy playoff team but coming of a torn labrum (major shoulder injury) we have to take a wait and see approach. My best bet is he won’t be that good until post-ASB, but since it’s on his non-shooting arm there could be a quicker recovery.  - FVV needs to be better. 39% fg is atrocious especially if your not even scoring 20 ppg. His career efficiency is 40% fg and needs to significantly improve otherwise y’all got no chance.  Some swing factors that could help is an OG breakout season, GTJ showcases more playmaking, and any positive production from Scottie Barnes.  In summary: That defense is legit, but you might have trouble scoring. If you follow the Knicks formula that should make you a playoff team."
"We're talking about the team being an offensive nightmare to watch.   OG at the 2 only works IF he makes ANOTHER massive leap, siakam is coming back rusty with no off season to work on his game, and our starting center is either Aron Baynes or Khem Birch, neither of which are starting quality centers. There's like 0 centers left in FA so I don't know who you're banking on to come and save our C lineup."
holes at pg and center unless they trust vanvleet at PG? I don’t see it tho I think he’s better at SG. and below average spacing with siakam and khem birch not being reliable outside shooters. Holes at backup PG and C as well unless you’re going to be playing boucher and jalen outside of their natural positions for significant minutes (assuming they don’t keep dragic).
We’ll take Khem Birch
Bro he’s a good player lol. Our coaching staff was stupid not to play him more in the playoffs. He was a huge reason we won game 5.  Have fun with Khem Birch though!
"they need a backup center, wonder if khem birch is an option"
We still have a potential Lauri sign n trade so maybe we could add more rim protection or sign someone like Khem Birch... but yeah defensively we arnt gonna be amazing
Give me Khem birch
I would love Tross + khem birch for Lauri except I think birch left orlando
"We're likely re-sign Birch so he or Precious will be our starting center.  Prolly going to be Khem to start while Precious gets more minutes and games to start as the season goes on.  Given our current FA, it's looking like we're headed to a more significant rebuild so no point in getting Holmes or Allen when we're developing our younger players like Barnes and Flynn."
Khem Birch.
Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
"&gt;We don't need a downgrade big when we could just pick up Baynes player option if we want to torture ourselves at the 5.We can also still bring back Khem Birch, and have Gillespie so Powell is just a straight downgrade for us.  oh ok understood. Good luck with the buyout"
"Achiuwa I get, I’d rather try to develop him too. But Khem Birch is already 28 and has been unable to show much despite playing for a bad team in Orlando.  If you’re looking to make the playoffs, you’d want him. If you’re not, it’s only a 2 year deal and he’s still a quality player who you could make ur backup big since he’s a Canadian who may like to stay.   Dragic at 19 mil is also an overlay so ur gonna have to trade for an overpay contract or keep him."
"We don't need a downgrade big when we could just pick up Baynes player option if we want to torture ourselves at the 5.  We can also still bring back Khem Birch, and have Gillespie so Powell is just a straight downgrade for us."
Hopefully it’s dallas. I’d honestly rather keep dragic and look for a deadline trade rather than trade him to OKC and have to give up picks. As long as we still have enough cap space for Khem Birch
"Khem Birch, Jeff Teague, Kyle Guy, TJ Leaf - The one syllable options are out there!"
"It proves how meaningless scrimmages are. Australia lost to an exhibition a Canadian team whose best player was Khem Birch prior to the 2019 World Cup. Again, it means nothing."
nah they suck. you better get Khem Birch or Tony Bradley tbh
"Didn’t you get Precious Achiuwa?  Khem Birch, lol"

"Otto Porter and Khem Birch come to Brooklyn, where you can get all the chopped cheeses and Arizonas you want."
Bam is going to feast. I've seen Lowry improve the game of almost every big man that has come through Toronto. Even Khem Birch in his limited time admitted to getting some of the easiest buckets of his career with Lowry feeding him the rock. A lot to look forward to if you're a Heat fan.
&gt; you can get a good decent of what Allen does for 60% the price.   Raptors fans over here wondering what Centres are available in FA that do a good decent of what Allen does because right now our starting centre is Khem Birch I guess? 🤷‍♂️
Derrick Favors or Khem Birch should be decent
That’s cool. I’d take AD for Kyle and Khem Birch if we’re just tossing out bullshit trades that will never happen.
Khem Birch
Dam the raptors lets chris boucher and khem birch walk or they never had any guarantee with the team?
"Hopefully hurts them since we'd be well above the cap if we traded for Simmons and that would be a problem if we wanted to re-sign Gary Trent Jr., poach for Allen or re-sign Khem Birch."
"man we desperately need a center  We lost so many games last year from not having just an average big  as soon as we got fucking Khem Birch from orlando, we looked so much better. baynes was ass  imagine if we get Allen.."
Hopefully a center. Khem Birch perhaps
"First of all, flair up. Secondly, thats a tired ass narrative.  There's been one dude that's left Orlando and become better. Oladipo. And he's the most overrated player in the NBA. We've developed guys like TMac, Dwight, Jameer Nelson, and Vooch into all-stars. Redick developed here. Mike Miller was MIP. Fournier went from a bench scrub to an NBA starter, Afflalo, Gortat, Khem Birch. All guys who turned into good players here.   The narrative that we don't develop anyone is dumb, the better argument is that we develop guys and then they leave to better teams once they've become good, but even that is a stretch."
It'd make more sense to just resign Khem Birch than trade Siakam for a package around Turner leaving us with a hole at the 4 which is more difficult to plug than just signing a big in FA.
"I mean, yeah. Did you see the C rotation until Khem Birch showed up?"
"OG is equal man to man but Simmons has better help defence.   FVV i can only truly name like 3 guards who are better defenders than him in the league (not these 6’6+ guards, kinda class them as more combo guys)   Lowry is obviously Lowry &amp; my franchise goat so i’m biased but this demand for Simmons is ludicrous. What are we meant to do, run a line up of Malachi, Bembry, Simmons, Siakam &amp; Boucher/Khem Birch?  Morey said we were in lala land wanting Maxey, Thybulle &amp; draft capital at the dead line for Lowry yet he’s legitimately asking for half our starting 5."
"Nothing, it's just LA so everything is amplified. It's basically like all the dumb homer shit you see on your own subs, except you have national media members unironically saying this shit. I'm not saying THT is shit but if he was on Charlotte or SAS, barely anyone would know who he is unless some national writer like Zach Lowe nerds out about them and memes about it like he did with Khem Birch, Malik Monk etc."
I mean he didn't.  Khem Birch was amazing in Orlando as a spot starter and Vuc backup.  He just had more minutes in Toronto but he put up virtually the same production on a per minute basis.  Dont know where you got that from.  Put it like this with Bamba.  If Steve Clifford can't get you to defend then you probably suck on defense.  Steve Clifford got top defenses out of Vuc and Al Jefferson.  Bamba has no excuses.
Raptors took Khem Birch and he's showed a lot more than he did in Orlando.  Does Bamba have more to him?
"Siakam has a AST% of 20.5% with a TOV% of 10.6%. RJ is at 13.8% and 10.5%. Siakam had 48.5 passes per game, 8.7 Potential Assists Per Game, 12.1 AST PTS Created and a 9.2% AST to Pass%. RJ was at 27.4, 5.2, 7.8, 11.0% respectively. Siakam is a better passer than RJ.  The Raptors were not better than the Knicks this season, we had OG Anunoby guarding centres for a lot of the season cause we had no playable centres until we signed Khem Birch and Freddie G at basically the end of the season. The Raptors were not good this season just based off not having a capable player at the most important defensive position."
"Nah the better choice would have been a mobile big that doesn’t eat up space near the rim all the time. The Raptors had issues spacing with Siakam, Kawhi, and Valanciunas, so they got Gasol.  Then, they had trouble spacing with Baynes, and Khem Birch worked way better. Zion just needs a centre who won’t eat up his driving lanes like JV and Adams do (through no fault of their own I love both their games individually)"
"Ben Simmons, OG Anunoby, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Khem Birch"
"When the Raptors finally signed khem birch late in the season Kyle Lowry was seen on the court mouthing ""thank you"" to birch after a play. Why a thank you? Because birch (who had just been released mid season by Orlando) could actually catch a pass... Aaron was so bad Lowry was passive aggressively clowning him mid game when he wasn't even playing"
"Lowry has fed a lot of dudes over the years as a Raptor, even guys that have no business being offensively competent (like he made Khem Birch look good)."
"&gt; we can build a team that suits Simmons skills better.   How? Name the players on that team. We have Khem Birch, Scottie Barnes, Ben Simmons. That’s 3 guys who can’t shoot. Plus Siakam. We are trading away our two best shooters in FVV+OG for Simmons.  The only way this works is if you trade essentially our entire team. Which won’t happen, it would ostracize the fan base."
Khem Birch actually.  He seemed to do much better playing with the Raps and has good chemistry with Nurse. I think he'll turn out to be a decent starting center. Which is exactly what we need
"The gap IS pretty big defensively though. Raps can play a starting 5 where Khem Birch is the worst defender. FVV/OG/Siakam are all fantastic, Malachi is a defence first guy, so is Scottie.  If you're looking at pure numbers, maybe they're similar, but how much does a lack of center change a team's ability to defend? Baynes really was that bad."
They got Khem Birch on a buyout. Saul good. Its gonna  happen more in the future lol
"&gt; might have a similar...work ethic...to Simmons.  Siakam's work ethic isn't a concern at all. He has actually shown improvement pretty much season by season and even this past season as well. Even with his three point shooting dropping off a cliff (which can be partly explained by a shoulder injury, covid and playing all games on the road basically) he actually improved in many aspects of his game.  If we were to look at just efficiency, even with his drastic 3P% drop off he was about as efficient as a whole versus two seasons ago where he was an All Star and All-NBA. He went from 55.4% to 54.7% True Shooting, 51.2% to 49.3% in EFG% and that is also which his FT% increasing from 79.2% to 82.7% and his 2P% from 49.9% to 50.9%.  One common criticism is Siakam's lack of a bag and being a beyblade, but he actually developed a couple counters to defenders trying to play that spin too hard. He has gone for the half spin with a leaning layup or baby hook vs the full spin as well as occasionally faking the spin to the paint and then spinning back to the baseline either to go to the rim or into a shot. He still needs to work on those counters but he has been getting in game reps with both which is good to see.  He has also shown more comfort getting the ball out his hands when faced with a full or partial double team which has been a major weakness for him since being the 1st option on the team in the wake of Kawhi's departure. He has been quicker passing the ball out which he then will attempt to repost to get the ball back or run a quick action such as a pick n roll or come up for a dribble handoff. He has also been surveying the court more versus just going into his move which has resulted in him seeing double team or players stunting and then decided to either go into his move or pass out before the double arrives. This can be reflected in his per100, 4.7A to 6.0A, 3.3TOV to 3.1, 10.7TOV% to 10.6TOV%.  Then we have his defense where he has been forced into playing more at the 5 due to not having a playable centre until Khem Birch, which Siakam stepped up in that role while still doing all the things that make Siakam the centre of our help and rotate + zone heavy defensive schemes and having an even larger impact on that end. 94th percentile in defensive versatility, 3rd in opponent fg% from 5-9 feet (among qualified players), 5th in the league iso points per possession allowed, 3rd in forced TOVs in iso, 2nd in the league in contested threes, 4th in defensive loose balls recovered and 4th among PFs in total contested shots per game. An elite defensive player who has shown the ability to guard 2 through 4 consistently and 1's and 5's when necessary as well.  When it comes to the three point shooting drop off, he got covid, shoulder injury and played all his games on the road. Siakam for his career has been a player who has played significantly better at home in Toronto than on the road and his three point shooting on the road is actually very similar to his three point shooting in a season where he played zero home games. For his career Siakam is a 32.5% shooter from three but if we look at his home and road splits that changes to 34.4% three point shooter at home and 30.7% three point shooter on the road.   So this whole Siakam might have a similar work ethic to Simmons when Simmons has not had any significant growth to his game but rather has rather been fairly stagnant is just hilarious to me. Siakam was the 27th overall and was deemed a major reach. He was mocked in the 2nd round, with DraftExpress having him at 52nd, 49th, 52nd, 42nd and 43rd overall in their six mock drafts that year. His draft comparisons were Bismack Biyombo, Luc Mbah a Moute and Bo Outlaw (which was Dwane Casey's comparison). He has been constantly lauded as a hard worker by teammates, coaches, our front offfice, training staff and team reporters. He went from being a reach at 27th overall to 2nd option on a championship, 1st option on a team that had the 2nd best record in the NBA, All Star starter and 2nd team All-NBA off of his work ethic which took him from ""athletic big man hustle guy but limited ball skills"" which was his basic scouting report coming into the league to ""athletic wing who attacks primarily on-ball and in transition with elite defence at the wing with versatility"". That would suggest an immense work ethic. This whole Siakam work ethic myth comes just from a time where he was having visa issues while living in a condo in Toronto during our stringent lockdown (unlike some US cities like whichever one Trae Young was running 5v5 in at the same time this was happening)."
PG: FVV  SG: Gary Trent Jr.   SF: OG Anunoby   PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Khem Birch  Bench:  Goran Dragic  Malachi Flynn  Scottie Barnes  Chris Boucher  Precious Achiuwa
"&gt; He was defnitely worse last year, with it being the 3rd straight year of scoring efficiency decline  While he did have an efficiency drop this season, it was from 55.4% TS to 54.7% and his EFG went from 51.2% to 49.3%. This is with his FT% increasing from 79.2% to 82.7%, his 2P% increasing from 49.9% to 50.9% and his FG% staying stable going from 45.3% to 45.5%. That efficiency decline this season came from his TP% dropping 35.9% to 29.7% which was a surprise after two seasons of 36.9% and 35.9% previously. If his three point shooting came back to even just his career average of 32.5% let alone the 35.9% he shot two seasons ago, his TS% and EFG would have actually increased this season. And as Siakam has already been known in every single season of his career to actually be more efficient at home vs the road for his career that would clearly hurt him. His 3P% is this season is actually fairly close to his career 3P% when on the road which makes sense as we played an entire season of road games (Fuck Tampa). Shoulder injury doesn't help either.  Career | FG% | FT% | 3P% | TS% | ------|---|---|---|---|---- Home | 50.1 | 79.0 | 34.4 | 58.4 | Away | 47.6 | 77.4 | 30.7 | 55.4 |  &gt; His defense has also gotten worse.   Straight up not true.  Siakam in this past season was an elite defender at the wing. He was 94th percentile in defensive versatility where he (alongside OG) where put in the position to have to actually defend 1 through 5 due to Aron Baynes being unplayable and having no actual playable centres until we signed Khem Birch. And he held his own even when forced into defending true bigs as shown in him being 3rd in opponent fg% from 5-9 feet (among qualified players). He is also elite in iso defense, where he was 5th in the league iso points per possession allowed as well as 3rd in forced TOVs in iso. Even with being someone who has shown they can guard 1 through 5 and is also elite in isolation, that isn't even his best strength on that end of the floor. He is primarily a help and recover defender in our typical defensive schemes which relies on his helping off his man either on the wing or in the corner to defend a drive or a partial/full double then when the ball is passed to the open man one pass away rotate either back to his man or if someone rotates to his man go two passes away to prevent the swing. This is shown in his being second in the league in contested threes while playing the 4 and 5 primarily as well as 4th in defensive loose balls recovered (which FVV plays a part in with how much he knocks the ball loose and plays the passing lanes as well). He is also a very active defender as well as shown by being 4th among PFs in total contested shots per game on top of his defensive loose balls recovered.  So as we can see, Siakam was an elite defender last year and one can VERY easily make the argument All Defense caliber on that end even when he was forced out of his typical role on defense this season due to our terrible big man rotation. If his defense got worse and he is still arguably All-Defense caliber, then man must have been DPOY talks caliber player in your view then. And it hasn't gotten worse, he actually took a step forward on defense.  &gt; Paying him 30+ million when he looks like a 2nd or 3rd option is pretty bad.  Second options get max money. That's just how it works in the NBA now. Even some 3rd options get the max as well."
No but he's good at finding the roller. Last season he threw many successful lobs to Khem Birch.
"The implication of the stats is that the higher you are and to the left the more your rebounding is empty.  Although obviously context is the most important. Khem Birch is there twice, once in Orlando where he made the Magic a worse rebounding team when he was on and again in Toronto where he was far and away the most impactful rebounder in the league. If I take that at face value he developed into a defensive rebounding force on the plane to Toronto."
"Who faults a coach for playing to win games?  It's on the front office to ""tank,"" coaches are trying to play smart and instill good habits in their players, you know, win games. When coaches start throwing games or giving players minutes they don't deserve you instill some very hard-to-break losing habits in guys. See: the Jacque Vaughn era in Orlando.   And who exactly was James Ennis or Chasson Randle playing in front of? We had no healthy guards or wings, let alone younger ones who deserved time so he literally had to play those guys. RJ Hampton went from 12th man in Denver to playing 25 minutes per game. Cole Anthony started 3/4 of the games he was healthy for. Okeke was getting 18 MPG over the first 5 games of the season before he went down with an injury. Clifford has consistently given the better players more minutes. There are certainly some questionable lineup decisions, but none that are terribly egregious.   As for Khem Birch, Khem was ahead of Bamba on the depth chart when we were trying to win, if the front office didn't want Clifford to play him, they could've easily traded him at the deadline. And ultimately, they ended up waiving him like a week later anyway.   &gt;Clifford has preferred playing vets to developing young players his entire head coaching career.   Literally, every NBA coach, at least the successful ones, prefers to put players who help them win on the floor."
"This sounds like it was written by Steve Clifford.       The guy started veterans James Ennis, Dwayne Bacon, Chasson Randle, and Khem Birch after the trade deadline when it was clear the Magic were trying to develop their young guys. It led to a meaningless win over the Pelicans, like many other meaningless late season Magic wins that have hurt their/your lottery odds and led to worse draft picks.      Your best prospect in years was Jonathan Isaac and didn’t even average 10 FGA/game by this third season under Clifford. MCW is atrocious lol. Gordon was so consistently underwhelming I have no idea how you could type that “he looked so good”… the Nuggets gave up a recent 24th pick in Hampton and a protected first rounder five years away, as well as the corpse of Gary Harris.       Clifford has preferred playing vets to developing young players his entire head coaching career. To suggest otherwise is true revisionist history."
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
This FO is afraid to admit they made a mistake with drafting Mo Bamba.  He's a bum.  They would rather trade away Vuc and release Khem Birch than get rid of Mo Bamba.  Bamba is so bad that WCJ immediately started over than him.  Just give up on the guy already.
can you imagine being named Khem Birch and not growing up to become 6'10
"Honestly our full squad is nothing but sick names. Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Pascal Siakam, Freddy Vanvleet, OG Anuonoby, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Nick Nurse, Yuta Watanabe, Delano Blanton, Goran Dragic. even Scottie Barnes is kinda cool  Definitely top 5 team based purely on cool/unique names"
"I don’t think so. Fred, Pascal, Gary, OG, Boucher, Khem Birch, and Dragic aren’t people who have barely played in the league.   Yes it’s possible that they get into play-in but even then this team (with Lowry) beat the Bucks twice on their home court last season. If they can do that, I’d say we are making the playoffs."
"I think so.   Look for PG: We got Vanvleet, Dragic, and Flynn, now I don’t have to explain why Vanvleet is great. Flynn is a good backup and someone who can pick up key minutes while resting Vanvleet. And Dragic is questionable since it’s possible Masai would wanna trade him or something but again, promising vet who brings in that Heat mentality of defence and rough play.   SG: Gary Trent, he’s a dawg. Like a bulldog, he’s great offensively and if Nurse can bring a very strong defending curve into his game (reason why he signed a 3year deal because he wants to ball out and bag an even bigger contract after his deal’s done), David Johnson, a two way player is a developing rookie but the best thing about guards are that all of them are interchangeable except Gary Trent. Vanvleet, Flynn, and Dragic can all create their own shots and playmaking is good.  SF: OG, Gillespie, Banton (OG is AMAZING defensively) Banton and Gillespie are promising due to their size and Gillespie plays Center but you can try to put a squad out there for resting minutes with your last backup as Gillespie as well.   PF: Probably the most exciting position on the squad because we got some titans like Siakam, Scottie Barnes (which yes doesn’t have a great shooting production due to his jumpers but man can run and defend), and ofc interchangeably Boucher as PF as well because this kid is freaking amazing.   C: Thank god we have Khem Birch, Boucher, and Precious, Gillespie. Arguably one of the most underrated Centers squad on a team. They all have great and different skills which can be used in different situations.  Other people like Wainright, Watanabe (great development last year), and new addition Bonga are so vital to this team as well.   So yes, I think they are very underrated partially because the most star players we have is Siakam and Freddy.   As long as Nurse’s diverse coaching rolled in with the squad that Masai is rebuilding with I can def see us making the playoffs and upsetting at least one team.  Idc who Raptors play, defending is going to be elite. Plus, the biggest thing is Raptors can play at Scotiabank Arena, because getting booed in Tampa rolled in Covid really did not do them any good."
"Nice high effort post!   I'd probably move Wiseman to 30th and Birch to 27th, but everything else I think is pretty much 100%. There are so many players, so who knows how the upcoming season will look.  Only things I would disagree with would be putting Wiseman that high, he was one of the biggest overall negatives for a starter in the league and he tore his meniscus. And put Khem Birch that low, he's a bit small and he's more of a bench player but Isaiah Stewart and Isaiah Roby are both pretty raw."
Steve Clifford could lead Khem Birch and and some college kids to the 8th seed.
Is it ~really~ a log jam?  PG: FVV / Malachi Flynn  SG: GTJ / ???  SF: OG / Yuta Watanbe  PF: Siakam / Scottie Barnes  C: Khem Birch / Chris Boucher  Also with Scottie Barnes and OG those are basically positionless players
"&gt; OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher and Yuta Watanabe  That’s not really a logjam. For one, Yuta and OG could play the 2 and have at times last season. Another thing to mention is that the front court has 3 slots while the backcourt has 2. Starting OG/Siakam/Birch then having Barnes/Boucher/Achiuwa off the bench is perfectly fine. I could see Nurse cycling in Yuta to be a positional filler in case someone goes down."
"Vuc has been a neutral defender since Cliff came to Orlando in 18-19. We had the 8th best DRTG in 18-19, and the 10th best in 19-20 (the team was destroyed by injuries + trades so 20-21 doesn't really count) with Vuc at center. On both squads we had a better or the same DRTG when he was on the court. Our backup was Khem Birch who is really good, and is also super underrated. (Also it's not like we were stacked with perimeter defenders, only Isaac was amazing, and AG was pretty good defensively, but the rest were neutral at best)  Vuc can be a neutral defender if he's used correctly as a big body in the paint to funnel guys towards. He's not versatile and he's in trouble if he gets switched out onto the perimeter, but in good defensive schemes you can avoid that. He's also good at post defense."
Khem Birch in shambles
"Who’s better, Khem Birch or Joel Embiid?"
Here's the list from last season.  DeMarcus Cousins  Andre Drummond  Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond  DeMarcus Cousins  Gorgui Dieng  Cristiano Felício    Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins  Dewayne Dedmon   Nikola Jokić  Kelly Olynyk  Bam Adebayo   Steven Adams  Khem Birch    Kelly Olynyk                                   Jeff Green            Bruno Fernando  Jahlil Okafor
Luka ate up Khem Birch like BBQ chicken
"I have lasting images of Scottie Barnes, Chris Boucher, &amp; Khem Birch/Precious Achiuwa murdering us on the offensive glass  As well as Gary Trent Jr. getting to the rim at will on us"
"Dragic isn't under contract for next season, so he's already not being included in that group. Same for Boucher. You need to look at the salaries for 2022-23, that's what would count for trying to open up a max slot for Ayton.   Siakam, FVV, OG, Barnes and Precious is $84 million if the Raptors get rid of literally everyone else in salary dumps or just waiving them (which would include Gary Trent Jr., Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, etc). That $84 million leaves $35 million under a $119 million cap, but then you have to include about $7 million for cap holds for empty roster spots, which brings that down to $28 million. Ayton's max would start at $30 million, as it would be 25% of the $119 million cap."
"&gt;Who would we give up that wouldn't just ruin our timeline.   Ayton wouldn’t ruin your timeline he’s the same age if not younger than a majority of your core. When it comes to a specific package I’m not going to name one because I’ll get shitted on regardless of what I say but there’s multiple hypothetical deals that can be made around Picks/swaps, 3-team trades, or around guys like Paschal, FVV, Trent jr etc  &gt;If we traded for him and signed him we still don't compete for a chip while we had him.  You’re not trading for Ayton just to trade for him you’re banking on upside. The roster you have now isn’t competing for a title either, but getting a guy who could turn into a All-NBA level big under your developmental staff is a good bet to bank on alongside the wing talent you have now  &gt;Doesn't make sense,   It’s all hypothetical  &gt;Toronto needs to sign a Centre as an FA without losing their pieces if we want to compete.  You guys don’t have readily available cap space to sign a major piece, and I doubt getting a MLE level guy launches you into contention if that were the case Khem Birch would be a championship caliber big and that’s just not true"
"I mean I wouldn't have them at their pre 2021 form either but this subreddit is underrating them quite a bit. 32 wins is an insanely low total. We aren't tanking this year, the team is definitely trying to make the playoffs. Nurse has never been one to just throw out young players over the established guys if anything that's been one of his faults, FVV played lots of minutes last year, even Lowry played 35 mpg. Outside of the late season tanks he rarely throws the young guys to the wolves. People keep calling us a rebuilding team which I guess is kinda accurate but I think people have this idea that we won't be trying to win next year which is nowhere close to the case. Scottie completely shut down Beal in that game against Washington and I think got better every game on that end. He's someone that I think especially on defense is just gonna get better and better every game. We were running guys like Stanley Johnson, Aron Baynes, Deandre Bembry for a lot of last season, we had probably the worst C group in the NBA to the point that even someone as mediocre as Khem Birch made the team look so much better.   Obviously I could end up being wrong but I would be very surprised if we weren't a top 10 defense this year and win at least 40 games."
"Okay I can see that argument, that's fair I understand it.  For me while I don't think playing in Tampa with a players going in and out of protocols is a fair representation of what the roster is capable of I'm still not convinced that Khem Birch is going to solve the defensive problems with the C position (especially if they're running a really big roster at other positions). I think the mode the org is in now is going to see a lot of young players get playing time, and honestly the two Raptors pre-season games I watched while Scottie looked great in some areas, defense definitely wasn't one of them for me. I'm just not convinced that the roster they'll be running is capable of delivering a 'scary' defense and while there are some absolute stalwarts in there I'm not sure I see them higher than 12-15th defensively."
"Because we have good defensive players? Siakam, OG and FVV are all very good to elite defenders. Add in Scottie who already looks good on that end and Precious and Khem Birch who aren't crazy good but will be an improvement from last year. And then add in Nurse who is one of the best defensive coaches in the league. Idk if we'll be top 3 or anything but playing all year in Tampa, having our top players all get covid and tanking the last 15 games of the season our defense was still middle of the road on the season."
Considering Khem Birch managed to fill in your C position I'd say the standards are low for starting level C's in the NBA.
"I’m actually kinda excited to watch the Raptors play this year, I’m been curious about how a 5-man lineup of Scottie Barnes, OG, Siakam, Precious Achiuwa &amp; Khem Birch will do on the court, especially on defense."
Yeah he was really good down the stretch last season.  Basically after Khem Birch was waived IIRC.
Taller Khem birch that can score.
Khem Birch 2.0
"""Khem Birch is younger"" ...oh wait"
Yeah but we can all agree Khem Birch is better than Embiid
Where do yall think khem birch is gonna land?
"Interestingly it doesn't really seem like his offense has been raw at all. He's been handling the fast break consistently well.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=_fofZtDkHDc&amp;feature=emb_logo  Even nailing some jumpers on the break as well. He seems pretty skilled. It might be that the Heat area a little stricter with roles and the Raptors less so, the same thing happened last year with Khem Birch when he got to the Raptors from Orlando. He'd taken no threes in Orlando but was firing them up as soon as he was traded over."

"Note to general public:  Please stop saying the Magic ""just never played him"" or ""finally he gets his chance""   Any Magic fan knows that wasnt the case...He was unplayable... Lacked serious bulk and stamina. Looked like he could barely lift his arms and make it up and down the court full speed consistently. I love Khem Birch as much as the next fan but it was embarrassing to lose minutes as a #5 pick to a guy whos main asset is just hustle.  He looks like a COMPLETELY different player this year than any of the years prior. He can actually move and can throw his body around without being tired 3 minutes in.  His skills are there and it had nothing to do with ""getting a chance"". It was ALL about being healthy and in shape."
I want him to be good but everytime I think about Bamba I think about him being out worked by Khem Birch for minutes which is wild because Khem doesn't do a lot well aside from knowing his role.
"raps couldve made the playoffs easily if it wasnt for covid taking out their entire coaching staff and starting lineup after all star break where they were once a 4th seed. which once they lost ground they rested most of their starters to get a good pick. that was all in march, even if they didnt rest/tank once their players got back from covid they couldve made a good run to get a 7/8 seed easily, especially the play-in. the way this team is constructed right now is way better than last years.  and khem birch is our starting c with a better mold, not precious. im not hating im just telling you what went into us missing the play offs. the east will be interesting this year, i also see knicks making the playoffs there are surprises every season  depth chart basically fvv/trent jr/OG/Siakam,Birch   bench: Flynn/ Dragic or Svi/ Barnes/ Boucher/ Precious  and they can run lineups of barnes/trent jr/OG/Siakam/Birch all guys long and tall 1-5"
precious aint even our starting centre is khem birch and hes been out with health and safety protocols. teams been playing without boucher siakam and birch so far they got depth
"Lol, we gonna have Khem Birch back eventually."
I'm feeling kinda bullish on OG lately and even Khem Birch is a lot better than Aron Baynes. Plus of course being back in Toronto will help them a lot. Guess it depends just how much Lowry being there really keeps them together. Dragic is nowhere near as good as him but he's a perfectly fine stop gap that will win them games. I think they'll win a lot of games on defense alone
most of our sub wants to see khem birch over boucher for some reason lmao. I like khem and we def need him for the match ups that are bad for boucher but apart from that I dont get it. Our favoritisms runs a little too hot on newer guys.
Khem Birch as of this moment.
"Khem Birch. He was a late bloomer, but every year he's improved and actually showed an expanded offensive game last year to go with his already stout defense. With an expanded role this season, I think he's going to shine."
"&gt;He just won't get the minutes or role this season to make the jump.  Our only other center is Khem Birch. Boucher will get plenty of minutes and role, but I still think OG is going to take over."
"Our starting center is khem birch/precious, raps would throw a max at a 22/23 year old Ayton easily"
"That seems to be the consensus ""Wasnt given the chance""....I dont think most people follow the Magic so thats easy to say but the fact of the matter was he was incredibly out of shape and and times looked like he was struggling to keep up and lift his arms. He was losing minutes to Khem Birch strictly based off of playing hard. He is better than Khem in almost every facet of the game yet just got out worked.  I dont think he really took is conditioning seriously but Jalen is the guy that leads by example so I think we'll see a lot of improvement across the board on the team"
"Pascal out, Gary Trent out, Khem Birch and Boucher out.   Starters meaning FVV, and Og, rest are new blood, Barnes, Dragic, Precious etc.   Drummond did feast though."
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
Don't forget to bring some of your best bench guys in *checks notes* Svi Mykhailiuk and khem birch? Ah rip
No khem birch slander here sir
Toronto had Aron Baynes playing major minutes at centre. We are ecstatic about having Khem Birch.
I think it's because he scrutinizes players so much that he almost gets tunnel vision when he sees someone like Khem Birch or GP2 do something really well lol
Extreme dark horse pick: Khem Birch
"We need Centers first. Precious and Khem Birch are the Centers right now, and neither of them are even 6’10. The only guy who is is Boucher, and well, he isn’t going to do very well against bigger guys."
"bro you cant say khem is as bad as baynes that is so disingenuous to him, birch may not be a starting center in the nba but he would be a really solid backup for us."
"Siakam has just been so disappointing. After he got that huge contract he played great for half a season but since then has either been injured, out with Covid, out with surgery, etc, and whenever he comes back from injury he plays like dogshit for 15-20 games then finally starts looking good and gets injured again.   Gotta say though, Masai has done him zero favours with the roster construction.  Clearly the hope is that precious will eventually turn into bam but that day is a long way off and currently the only competent centre on the roster is khem birch who wouldn’t even crack the rotation on any other team.  Khem goes out with injury and the defence falls off a cliff."
"They got no rim protection or size inside. And while Khem Birch is kinda part of that problem and not elite or anything, at least when he was healthy the first 10 games, the Raptors had a Top 10 defense.   Precious is incredibly young and inexperienced (also lacks some size) at a position that requires experience to master.   And Boucher is a twig out there.   Raptors are reeling missing the inside presence and experience of Gasol and Ibaka  They still generate great ball pressure, get tons of deflections, and are able to rotate effectively so Im gonna say the defensive collapse hinges on the roster lacking legitimate inside presence.   Theres like 15 centers in the nba that I think would overnight make the Raptors a Top 10 defensive team.   Even a Zubac and Plumlee caliber player would transform this team"
"Our center rotation is like Khem Birch and Precious Achiuwa. Also we’re running a new scheme that utilizes our new length, so its gonna take time for everything to run well especially with all the new pieces we have. Also basically we trap ball handlers and have dudes scramble to close out which only works sometimes"
Scottie Barnes  OG Anunoby  Pascal Siakam  Fred VanVleet  Gary Trent Jr  Precious Achiuwa  Khem Birch  Dalano Banton  Would be the likely list I imagine.
"He’s still got a lot to improve on. He’s definitely made improvements in terms of his motor and energy out there, that was the knock on him from most of us Magic fans.  At times, yeah, he still does look lost, but I think that’s because of his lack of experience. These past few years he’s either been injured or Clifford refused to flat out play him because Khem Birch was just better at what Clifford wanted out of our backup C. This year, he’s getting a chance to play through his mistakes and he’s finally showing us something.   Offensively, he shows glimpses — but ultimately he’s gonna settle for a 3. He can’t really back people down in the post nor is he a great post defender.  He’s got a pretty nice hook shot though — so that’s something.   I know he’s one of the leader in blocks but he chases them way too much. He needs to get better at picking and choosing his spots cuz his man either gets open for a dunk or someone else roles to the rim and he’s late to contest — happens more often than you think with him.  He’s still young. I think he’ll be a serviceable starter down the road but that’s about it for him. If you asked me to choose right now, I’d choose WCJ though. That’s not to say I’m low on Bamba but WCJ’s just the more consistent and physical player."
Khem Birch
"While we’re on the subject, Nick Nurse was asked if Scottie Barnes or Khem Birch should shoot more 3s, and he commented that he would like them both to be shooting more 3s."
"at the end of last year when they picked up khem birch off a buyout who played 30 mins and then signed a g leaguer who played 15? they literally stopped playing small to close out the year and started resting starters, im not sure what type of rebuttal this was supposed to be"
Nice flop by Khem Birch.
"I'm so disgusted that Boucher &amp; Achiuwa are getting more touches than our top draft pick and leading scorer, Scottie Barnes. Too bad Khem Birch and Yuta are out, Nurse can't bench either of those selfish ""try to do too much"" players especially on a 2nd night of a b2b."
Khem birch got injured then. He is unironically a very important player for us so we dont play boucher
"as long as barnes gets his stats, I really don't give two shits if it's a L or a W at this point. I think the Raps are about to get in a very rough patch. Don't be surprised if they start losing a lot of games, they look rough without Khem Birch out there while trying to integrate Siakam at the same time. They'll eventually get it together if everyone stays healthy though."
I miss Khem Birch man.  Precious and Boucher aint it.
Lol. Once Khem is back I like FVV-GTJ-OG-Pascal-Birch then go to Barnes-Banton-OG-Siakam-Birch for the first lineup change to play some long ball.
"""Raptors: Khem Birch +40, Fred VanVleet +30""  This doesnt surprise me. Khem has been great defensively and he and FVV work so well together on offense its being called ""Khemistry"" in game threads lol"
"We had Aron Baynes and Alex Len who were both trash, we ended up giving Boucher a lot more time at the 5 but he's undersized and doesn't really have the BBIQ for it - despite people assuming he's a defense prodigy because he gets cool blocks once in awhile. We got Khem Birch late in the season and he looked like a god in comparison but he's a backup level talent, and he's also undersized.  Now we have Precious who is also undersized as a 5. Our 4/5 depth is Pascal, Precious, Boucher, and Khem. Khem and Precious are the only ones who should play C and only as backups"
"I genuinely believe that neither guy even warrants a roster spot on pretty much every other team in the league. Raptors weakness is the center position, and yet I'd still so happily start Khem Birch over either powell/wcs right now"
Khem Birch
"KAT also doesn’t match the current draft focus on everyone can switch on defense &amp; run fast. There’s some traditional type players like Khem Birch, but the top assets like draft picks are all-in on 6’9” long players who run like the wind."
Who is Khem Birch?
"Calls his own number a lot when he gets the ball, but the rest of the game rounds it out some more. Hopefully he figures it out. He's probably worse than Khem Birch, who's playing behind him right now, but he has way higher potential and can create his own shot (even if it isn't falling rn)"
Khem Birch and GTJ are much better than I thought. Fred and OG have taken a leap. Scottie is way more developed than you'd expect by now. And Siakam ain't even back yet.  Don't be shocked if Raptors secure a top 6 seed. They're deep and built well for the regular season.
Poeltl and Birch fill kinda the same role and honestly I kinda like Khem more because he has better touch offensively
"I rly like Khem Birch man, whenever he is playing I feel like we will get perfect screens, boxouts, and presence on the glass. Plus he is Canadian!"
"Khem Birch is absolutely, unequivocally vital and important to the Toronto Raptors, if you’re just looking at the box scores to make a basketball statement, don’t."
KHEM BIRCH
Khem Birch out to get that spot back from Precious Aichuwa
Khem Birch +20 baby. New York City baby.
"Khem Birch with football passes, screens, rebounds. Doing it all."
"I’m here to overreact, the Raptors are going to the finals and winning with a FMVP performance from Khem Birch"
Khem Birch...
"Yeah all these comments from people who didn't watch the games have been annoying....Bamba was pretty bad, granted there were a heap of interruptions to his development but the dude lost his rotation spot to Khem Birch. This season it looks like he's finally grown into that body of his and has caught up to the speed of the NBA a bit more"
He averages nearly 6 potential assists per game the issue has more to do with guys like Khem Birch and Precious Achiuwa just not catching the ball and finishing plays. Comparing him to Magic Johnson may be a bit of a hyperbole but he definitely will be an above average playmaker in his prime.
"Gorgui Dieng, Thad Young, Daniel Theis, Khem Birch, Ed Davis, Derrick Favors. It’s tough to get rebounding defenders of starter quality cause you know they are starters for a reason."
