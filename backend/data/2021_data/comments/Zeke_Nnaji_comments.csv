"&gt; Well RJ Hampton and Zeke Nnaji  Those 2 should have definitely got some playtime, but Malone is famous for not playing Rookies but hes ok with G-leaguers.   If the team is considered contender than having that many prospects and unproven players seams redundant?"
"As a Nugs fan our 5 worst players lineup is really fun to watch PG Markus Howard SG R.J. Hampton SF Bol Bol PF Vlatko Cancer C Zeke Nnaji  Idk if we have the best 5 worst players, but watching them check into a game is fantastic as a victory cigar lineup"

"He should play the first round pick Zeke Nnaji. Big and strong player that can grab boards, protect the rim, and has a silky smooth mid range shot."
"Zeke Nnaji has been pretty good for Nuggets.l in the games where he has minutes. Shoots 3pt well, smart kid, good bbiq on defense too."
"nuggets missing 2 starters and key bench players... our best bench players are PJ dozier who just came back from injury and is averaging 7 points, and Zeke Nnaji who is a rookie averaging 3 points... That‚Äôs our 2 best bench players atm. All of our defenders are gone aswell"
"While I like Malachi Flynn, it sucks seeing players I was also high on do really well for other teams like Theo, Cole Anthony, Zeke Nnaji."
"He‚Äôs ahead in a metric - team record - that we both just explicitly agreed is the most fluid of any of the factors relevant to the MVP race.  So why are we bringing up team record with 40+ games left to play?  Or at the very least, why frame in the condescending, static manner that you did?   Which is more likely? * nuggets get to the 4-5 seed * nuggets stay at the 7 seed * nuggets fall to the 9 seed   Because when you say shit like ‚Äúlmao they ain‚Äôt givin mvp to the 7 seed fam‚Äù or ‚Äúlol he‚Äôs only a game and half out of the play-in game‚Äù you‚Äôre saying that you think scenarios 2 and 3 are more likely than scenario 1.  You‚Äôre entitled to that opinion, but I would disagree. I do think this current version of the nuggets has some flaws that the teams the previous two years (when Denver was the 2 and 3 seed, respectively) didn‚Äôt have. But this team also has a much higher ceiling along with that lower floor.  It‚Äôs just a much higher variance team, trying to integrate MPJ who is still learning, trying to integrate 3 rookies other than MPJ (facu, rj hampton, zeke nnaji - and that‚Äôs not even including bol bol who probably doesn‚Äôt factor in this year), trying to deal with a plethora of injuries to their wings (Harris, Barton, dozier) and their bigs (Millsap, green, and Whittington) and stitching together lineups that work.  I‚Äôm inclined to believe they will figure it out and land somewhere around the 4-5 seed than 7-9. And if that‚Äôs the case with the crazy impact numbers Jokic has had, I‚Äôm not sure how you hold that against him."
Shoutout to Zeke Nnaji. He looked good out there
A lot of Nuggets fans HATE Barton. I get it but he always looks to get Joker the ball and he‚Äôs a smart player. I will say Malone has his favorites and he can get stuck w rotations that don‚Äôt work sometimes but he usually gets proven right. Fans were clamoring for Zeke Nnaji this year and he played him 30 min against ATL and he got 7 pts. People clamoring for MPJ to start and since starting he‚Äôs avg like 10 ppg. Malone knows what he‚Äôs doing
We're starting our rookie Zeke Nnaji  We down bad lmao
You mean 1st round rookie Zeke Nnaji? Who's played less than 100 minutes in his career so far after a short offseason? Guess the Nuggets should give up on him if he's not a star by now.
Let's all say a prayer for Jokic and Murray so that they never ever have to watch a guy named.... Zeke Nnaji play 13 minutes in an NBA basketball game again
"Tbh I disagree with you. I think he‚Äôs a good player but our defense is really not awful, our open shots just refuse to fall for us. That‚Äôs why I also am of the opinion that Denver‚Äôs 3 point percentage during our streak wasn‚Äôt like crazy or something, jok just creates open 3s on the reg. Zeke nnaji could really make up for that in the 2nd unit imo.   All that said Jerami could definitely hit open 3s at least lol"
"Lakers struggle shooting the three, their rim protection is pretty bad especially since they lost guys JaVale McGee. Even during their seven game winning streak the Lakers struggled shooting the 3, look at their shooting percentage.  LeBron was bitching at the refs all night last night yelling at his teammate and showed nothing but frustration.  The Nuggets gave a lot of minutes to bench guys like Campazzo and  Zeke  Nnaji last night that really decimated LA."
"Zeke Nnaji, that is all."
Zeke Nnaji doesn't have to face Zeke Nnaji.
Jokic is the most unstoppable player in the league because he's the only player that doesn't have to face Zeke Nnaji
Zeke Nnaji keeps getting disrespected smh
"No. Beasley is a great scorer, and he flashes decent defense, but he's not a better option than who we have right now. We decided to earn something in return for him and some other guys rather than having him walk for nothing after the year.   Beasley, Juancho, Vanderbilt we traded for a first round pick who is now Zeke Nnaji. Nnaji just had 16 very important bench points against the Lakers in a blowout win. Beasley is the second best player on a team with 6 wins. I don't miss him."
"Idk man that Nuggets bench is pretty good, they got:  Monte Morris  Facundo Campazzo  PJ Dozier  JaMychal Green  Paul Millsap  &amp;#x200B;  Idk if it's better defensively but efficiency wise they are (even tho they don't shoot at the volume the Knicks bench does), not to mention 11-15 they are by far the best in the NBA imo. I mean RJ Hampton, Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, are all getting minutes on most teams imo."
Zeke nnaji is my new best friend
Zeke Nnaji is my valentine
 2016 ‚Äì Malik Beasley ‚Äì 19th overall  2017 ‚Äì Monte Morris ‚Äì 51st overall  2018 ‚Äì MPJ ‚Äì 14th overall  2020 ‚Äì Zeke Nnaji ‚Äì 22nd Overall  2020 ‚Äì RJ Hampton ‚Äì 24th overall  The way this FO keeps hitting on these mid/late-round picks is crazy
Zeke Nnaji stonk üìàüìàüìà
Kyle Kuzma is turning into a poor man‚Äôs Zeke Nnaji.
Zeke Nnaji looking like the future!
Zeke nnaji was our first round draft pick.
"Fuckers in r/NBA_DRAFT tryna tell me Zeke Nnaji is a center, that he can't play with someone like Jokic.   He was obviously an NBA power forward."
Zeke Nnaji? Is Bol Bol that bad?
"Losing Grant hurt just because he's the only guy with the true body of a wing defender we had, being 6'8"" with a 7'3 wingspan and very athletic. However, I can't fault him, he's tearing it up in Detroit and this is likely to get him way bigger contracts than being an important role player on Denver.  However, Denver just drafted a rookie name Zeke Nnaji, who's 6'9"" 240 lbs and extremely athletic, (Also has good footwork and a solid jump shot) and I'm hoping he can grow into that kind of role in the next year or so, I really think he's our SF of the future. (MPJ should not be playing SF, his footspeed is too slow, and he has to play on the perimeter too much. If you watch him when he plays PF, his defense is MUCH more solid.)  Green has looked really great so far, grabbing boards like a boss, playing good D, and hitting his open 3's. I really like his fit here."
"**2020**: Zeke Nnaji at 22, RJ Hampton at 24.  **2019:** Bol Bol at 44.  **2018:** Michael Porter Jr at 14.  **2017:** Monte Morris at 51.  **2016:** Jamal Murray at 7, Malik Beasley at 19  **2014:** Nikola Jokic at 41."
My heart is already sold to Zeke Nnaji.
"Hopefully we‚Äôll see more of Zeke Nnaji from now on, great game by the reserves in the 4th quarter"
He must be talking about Zeke Nnaji. I don‚Äôt recall there being any guy named ‚ÄúJokic‚Äù in the NBA.
"The tanking to get out of the Lakers way might be pretty hilarious.  Like [this 2006 contest, the last game of the season between the tanking Wolves and the Grizz](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200604190MIN.html) where Mark Madsen took 7 threes, making zero.  The Mad Dog went 1-15 in this tank-fest, despite not putting up more than 4 shots in any other game that season.  My body is ready for Madsen-fest two.  I want to see Zeke Nnaji put up 20 shots!"
"No one really knows.   There's a contingent of fans who want him to play all the time, at least get consistent minutes. There's people who view him as a huge project and everything in between. There's credible rumors he was on the table for the Magic but they preferred RJ Hampton, but still just rumors. It's possible that since the Nuggets held on to him they still want to see if he can become another freaky unicorn wing/big for them to pair with MPJ and Jokic.   For my taste - eh. I could go either way. Zeke Nnaji is better as a role player and more ready to contribute to winning, playoff basketball."
"Zeke Nnaji.   I wanted a 6‚Äô7‚Äù-6‚Äô9‚Äù wing with 3&amp;D potential. Turns out Zeke is 6‚Äô9‚Äù, plays solid perimeter defense as a rookie, and is shooting 42% from three."
"Zeke Nnaji looks like he could fill the Grant role. Beasley was fun for us but we almost always have a surplus of guys in that role, I mean one slept on advantage of having your center as the primary ballhandler is that you get outrageous offensive versatility playing 5-out. Means you get more fast cutters/shooters than other teams where one of those players is usually the PG. Jokic makes it so easy for other guys on the court to contribute offensively and if teams try to double him he‚Äôs basically guaranteed to find the open player. Makes guys like Beasley who aren‚Äôt good defensively for us fairly expendable."
"Zeke Nnaji looks like he could be a good fit in the grant role soon, and his outside shooting is better"
Zeke Nnaji
"Kris Humphries was the only top 20 prospect from Minnesota for a looong time.  But since 2014, we've got:  2014 - Tyus Jones  2018 - Tre Jones  2019 - Matthew Hurt (turns out he sucks though)  2020 - Jalen Suggs  2021 - Chet Holmgren  2023 - Tasion Chatman  Then throw in some others who didn't quite crack the top 20 - Gary Trent Jr, Amir Coffey and Daniel Oturu (both on the Clippers), Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) and Tyrell Terry all in that same time frame .    MN hoops is up and coming"
"Tim Connelly is a master scout. As long as whatever deals are made to bring Giannis to the Nuggets is more or less equal in value, then the Nuggets become the more dangerous contender. Connelly will just replenish the ranks with late 1st round and 2nd round picks. Case in point, the 2 players they picked in the last draft, RJ Hampton and Zeke Nnaji, are showing a lot of promise."
&gt;Edwards on the other hand has been playing very well and I see glimpses of LeBron when I watch him.   I see glimpses of Giannis in Zeke Nnaji. He's roty.
"Ya Denver drafted the hyper athletic Zeke Nnaji at #22 this year. He hasn't even broken 10mpg on that deep team and has a lot of offensive options ahead of him when he's on the court but he's still shooting 39.2% from 3 on 1.4 attempts a game as a 6'10 240lb center prospect with a 7'2"" wingspan. And he's also shown the ability to defend 1-5 (3-5 at a really high level).   To be clear: not trying to randomly hype up Nnaji. Just a random comparison that seemed an easy way to show how a trait like that doesn't mean much.  Idk if a young big shooting 31% nowadays is a sign that you definitely want him taking more 3s in the future. These guys aren't exactly not being exposed to shooting 3s in college and highschool anymore. That's how those other bigs of the pastwere developing those shooting games late in their careers...  They hadn't already been focusing on it."
"That's pretty much what Denver Nuggets were turning into. One or two injuries away from a Campazzo, Shaq Harrison, Zeke Nnaji, Jamychal Green, Jokic starting 5."
Zeke Nnaji will be a superior upgrade to AG
"Zeke Nnaji, used to play for the University of Arizona actually"
Zeke Nnaji
Im putting all my money in Zeke Nnaji stonks
i wish Zeke Nnaji was a really good player in this league so we could have Levi yelling Zeke AOT memes
Unironically: play Zeke Nnaji like 5mins in real game time to give Joker a break guarding Ayton
Zeke Nnaji will be a beast in like 2 years
He got carried by Zeke Nnaji today
"MPJ improved a lot but he's struggling with consistency, especially now in the playoffs, which is perfectly understandable considering his age. But even if he played better, I wish that would have been enough for us to truly be better than last year.   Jerami Grant is an excellent two-way player and we couldn't really find a replacement for him. Gordon is good on defence but sometimes invisible on offence. Jamychal Green is okay as a backup but nothing more. Milsap is one year older and he can give you a quarter of good basketball every like five games but that's it.  People forget how important Gary Harris was last year. Him coming back from injury turned that series vs Jazz. Murray balled out but we actually lost one of those games where he scored 50 and then won the last two with Harris. Craig was great on defence as well and our replacements for him are PJ Dozier (injured) and Zeke Nnaji (not playing).  Plumlee had his issues (AD buzzer beater flashback) but he was a solid backup big overall and we couldn't find a replacement for him. Javale isn't playing much and we usually go with Green at five which isn't working that well.  Campazzo is a positive but he's not much of a scorer and we need scoring badly. He would be a backup with Murray healthy but our bench is terrible at scoring anyways, so he wouldn't contribute much on that end anyway. Morris is playing worse than last year. And yeah, Barton is injured again although he might come back in the next few games."
POV: You're Zeke Nnaji
"Zeke Nnaji went to my high school, pretty cool seeing him out there even if it‚Äôs in garbage time"
"for anyone else reading this chain, just to show you how disconnected this dude is from reality, he doesn't consider 2:43 left in a game to be ""2 mins"" lmfao  &gt;2:43		Vlatko Cancar enters the game for Michael Porter Jr.	104 - 125	 2:43		Markus Howard enters the game for Monte Morris	104 - 125	 2:43		Shaquille Harrison enters the game for Nikola Jokic	104 - 125	 2:43		Zeke Nnaji enters the game for Aaron Gordon	104 - 125"
"There's a ton of untapped potential in Africa, I mean look this past years draft had 8 players of Nigerian descent:  Onyeka Okongwu (Hawks) Isaac Okoro (Cavaliers ) Precious Achiuwa (Heat) Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) Desmond Bane (Celtics) Udoka Azubuike (Jazz) Jordan Nwora (Bucks) Daniel Oturu (Timberwolves)  And that's just players of Nigerian descent, African is a big ass continent with a shitload of different people. Wise investment here for the NBA. It also makes me wonder whether they'll be investing in India as well, another place with a huge population and the potential to produce NBA players and grow the NBA's international audience"

You lost me when you mentioned BOL BOL and nothing about Zeke Nnaji. Zeke will be the most important factor outside of the big 4 next year. And BOL BOL is gone.
We're a Zeke Nnaji turning into Mikal Bridges away
"They don't need people from other countries, if Team Nigeria had all the people with Nigerian heritage they'd already be insane.   Giannis, Bam, Anunoby, Ayton, Desmond Bane, Zeke Nnaji, Iguodala, Okafor, Oladipo, Okongwu, Okoro.  There's a ton of Nigerian NBA talent."
"The 2020 NBA Draft had Onyeka Okongwu, Isaac Okoro, Precious Achiuwa, Udoka Azubuike, Zeke Nnaji, Daniel Oturu, Jordan Nwora and Desmond Bane who were either from Nigeria themselves or had a parent from Nigeria.  So not only is the top end talent promising, but they would be able to field a deep team"
"I think with minutes, Zeke Nnaji could be a 15/7 guy"
"I think Zeke Nnaji might make a huge jump, coach Malone said he has much bigger plans for him next season"
"Well it‚Äôs kind of weird to think about but all of Jokic, Murray, Porter Jr, Monte Morris, and Aaron Gordon are 25 or younger. Plus, they have some other intriguing pieces include Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, PJ Dozier, and Markus Howard. They could run a respectable NBA rotation with just their young guys, which makes them all the more dangerous with some veteran signings."
Honestly our same team except we have Donovan now  PG: Jamal Murray  SG: Donovan Mitchell  SF: MPJ  PF: Zeke Nnaji  C: Bol Bol

On the Nuggs not just an MPJ take:  Zeke Nnaji  Not on the Nuggs: RJ Hampton
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
Zeke Nnaji can be a true 3D big
Dozier and Facu as well! We‚Äôll see if Zeke Nnaji can take a leap too.
"Vlatko is awesome, but we just drafted Zeke Nnaji. I think it‚Äôs going to be hard for him to get time with us. I‚Äôd personally love to see him get run with an organization that could use him."
"Honestly the question that makes it difficult is who is the matching salary. You need to be able to send out 30 million bucks worth of dude for Ben Simmons without completely screwing your team post-trade.  For us the matching salary would have to be Aaron Gordon and Will Barton, but like, IDK if I even want to do that trade straight-up, Barton is our starting 2-guard and Aaron Gordon is like 85% of Ben Simmons for 60% of the money. Maybe if the concept is Gordon / JaMychal Green / Zeke Nnaji? IDK, still not even that stoked.  So you kind of have to be like ... who has 30 million bucks worth of slightly overpaid role player that would help the Sixers. Porzingis from Dallas? Cam Reddish and two of (Capela / Gallo / Bogdanovic - who has a trade kicker btw) from Atlanta? Bagley and one of Barnes / Hield from SAC? Hayward from CHA?"
"That just doesn't make much sense. We'd have to give up real assets to get that high up in the draft. Our best trade pieces are what, Monte Morris, Zeke Nnaji, and picks? No shot."
17 for 26 and Zeke Nnaji (who was pick 22 last year)?
"Zeke Nnaji, and PJ obviously  Other teams - Patrick Williams, Malik Monk, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane"
I don't see what young guys they'd have to offer since most of their depth has been gutted over the past few years. Zeke Nnaji?
I don't see what young guys they'd have to offer since most of their depth has been gutted over the past few years. Zeke Nnaji?
"Just to add:  Isaac Okoro - Cavs,  Chinezie Metu- Sac,  Chuma Okeke - Orl,  Onyeka Okongwu - Atl,  Zeke Nnaji - Denver,  Udoka Azubuike - Jazz,  Desmond Bane - Mem,  Jordan Nwora - Bucks,  Daniel Oturu - Clips  Monte Morris - Den"
"Depending how Denver end up Zeke Nnaji could be taking a leap for sure, has looked good in small minutes"
Nnaji matches up as a 3/4 rather than 4/5. Nuggets probably let Milsap walk and have Zeke take over as the backup 4 with Green at the 5
"I know it‚Äôs not Zion, but Zeke Nnaji is super into piano. It honestly could be something Zion is into and Griffin is also into that he tried to relate to him over."
&gt;Unless the plan is to Bol Bol  We also have Zeke Nnaji
"If Denver has to involve MPJ or Murray, then Denver should hang up immediately. I‚Äôm thinking more of a package of Monte Morris + Aaron Gordon + Bones Hyland/Zeke Nnaji and two-three first round picks. Not the greatest offer, but the Simmons trade market is pretty dry"
And you guys have all the versatile tall people.   Joker. Bol Bol. Zeke Nnaji. Aaron Gordon. PJ Dozier.....  Scary long bois
"Because the Nuggets are not in need of prospects currently out of their G-League team.     They will have Howard/Bol Bol and maybe Zeke Nnaji all playing some time there and they need to surround them with capable players who can simulate an NBA environment since currently those guys all struggle to adapt to in-game situations and pressure.     We also don't need them taking every shot, they need to be able to be able to play alongside other quality NBA level players and so for us having veterans is a great thing.  We aren't looking for guys to break into the rotation this year, or long developmental projects necessarily just a good functional/nba-like environment for our (brand new) G-league squad so the guys we are trying to develop can get good reps."
"It‚Äôs hard to copy Denver. They‚Äôve been one of the best drafting teams in the league. Getting Jokic in the second round is obvious, but they‚Äôve also hit on a ton of mid to late first round picks.   ### All their first round picks were great in 2016  -	Jamal Murray (#7 Pick) -	Juan Hernangomez (#15) -	Malik Beasley (#19)  ### They got a solid player in 2017, despite not having a first round pick.  -	Monte Morris (#51)  ### Michael Porter Jr was obviously a steal in 2018  -	Michael Porter Jr (#14)  ### No Pick in 2019  ### Both their picks in 2020 seem to have potential   -	Zeke Nnaji (#22) -	RJ Hampton (#24)  ### Bones Hyland has played super well in pre-season  -	Bones Hyland (#26)"
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, K√©vin S√©raphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Can√ßar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
Zeke Nnaji better turn into the beast titan.
"Not even just the core locked up but we've also locked up our primary bench pieces (Monte Morris and PJ Dozier), we've got control of the majority of our future draft picks, and we still have intriguing young talent like Bol Bol and, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji.  Tim Connolly still has all the firepower to swing for a huge trade without even having to touch one of Murray, Jokic, or MPJ."
So u may say Zeke Nnaji = Bol Bol Bol Bol?
"For his career, Zeke Nnaji averages 1 assist per 100 possessions lol"
Nnaji is terrible on D however...didn't you notice.. Realy you think Zeke is a good defensive player.. All i saw is whomever he was guarding scoring..
"With Nikola out, I‚Äôve been watching more so to see if there is anything positive to take away from these games instead of watching for wins. The 3-point shooting of late has been encouraging. Monte and Jeff Green had good 3-point shooting games today and the last couple. AG has looked really, really good with an increased offensive load, which is something to watch when the big man comes back (18-7-4 on 63% from the field in the last 3 without Jokic). Free Zeke movement continues to build up steam with his great defense and his 3 point shooting has been good. With JMyke looking like a disaster on both ends, Nnaji might play himself into the backup 4/5 role soon. Hopefully, a lot of this stuff can carry over when Jokic returns and we can make a run. The hellish part of the month is over after Miami on Monday and a relatively soft schedule in the next couple of weeks despite 7 straight on the road."
"Yeah, the pipeline has been insane in the last 10 years or so for high level college guys with a lot of draft picks thrown in.  You‚Äôve had Tyus, Tre, and Gary Trent out of Apple valley, Rashad Vaughn, Daniel Oturu, Matthew Hurt (super highly rated prospect but left duke early and is stuck in the G league), Zeke Nnaji, Holmgren and Suggs out of v, JP Macura who was a stud at Xavier, Freddie Gillespie and Kendall Brown out of east ridge, Tyrell Terry, Royce White (who flamed out), McKinley Wright, Jericho Sims. Minnesota has had a 5 star I think every year for the last 10 years.    Lot of good woman players as well most notably Page Beuckers who‚Äôs at UConn now"
"We only have one rookie, Bones, and he is injured. And the rookie from last year, Zeke Nnaji, is injured too."
"It‚Äôs almost like the nuggets look like a completely different team without Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji. Who could have predicted this?"
Andre Drummond should never start again. Charles Bassey stepped up for the Sixers off the bench. Seth Curry regained his rhythm. No one not named Jokic wanted to show up for the Nuggets tonight. Some of the Nuggets turnovers were brutal to watch. Nuggets need Jamal back. There was no Zeke Nnaji and that saddens me.
We seemed like we had just started to find some solutions and it was letting bones run the offense (he got hurt) staggering will barton (he was out) and playing zeke nnaji more (he was hurt) so not to worried about it

"Zeke nnaji. He usually doesn‚Äôt play but he looked great, I think most fans would like to see him more"
"Zeke Nnaji looked so promising leading up to the draft. How has he been doing in Denver, Nuggets fans?"
Waiting on the Zeke Nnaji highlight reel
This is only the 4th time Zeke Nnaji has scored in double digits. All of them are victories. As long as Zeke scores at least 10 the nuggets will never lose.
"What‚Äôs your point? I watch the Nuggets all the time. Their bench is horrible. Nnaji and Cancar do nothing. Bol Bol will make mistakes for sure, but so will those guys and, at least, Bol Bol brings energy and brings the crowd into a frenzy. He actually does have talent even if he may not look like it. Certainly more than Caleb, KZ, Zeke or Vlatko. Not sure why you are spouting off about things you don‚Äôt know about."
"I understand everything you‚Äôre saying, but given he was always skinny and there wasn‚Äôt much opportunity for his frame to put on mass (given what we saw from Manute), I‚Äôm unsure why the Nuggets would take that flyer on him. He was always going to be skinny as all hell.   He likes to play on the perimeter for sure, but that isn‚Äôt uncommon for a lot of bugs nowadays. It seems like you could bring him into games where the team is listless and hope for a few blocks to get the crowd into it? What do Zeke Nnaji and Vlatko Cancar bring to the table? They‚Äôre both above him in the depth chart."
"This is the number one choice. Love the Nuggets, but not sure why this guy can‚Äôt get playing time even when half the time is injured. They bring in Zeke Nnaji over Bol Bol? Wth?"
