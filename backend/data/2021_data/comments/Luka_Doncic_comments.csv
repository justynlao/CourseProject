"Currently, the consensus Vegas odds are as follows.  LeBron James	+350  Nikola Jokic	+440  Joel Embiid	+550  Kevin Durant	+750  Luka Doncic	+750  Steph Curry	+1200  Giannis Antetokounmpo	+1300"
Rockets fans always playing the victim. Ben Simmons Luka Doncic classified as PGs why would Harden get laughed at when playing next to Eric Gordon?
"Luka ""Literally Stalin"" Doncic"
"This is exactly why i said Luka has somewhat inflated stats like a lot of rookies in todays league. Trae and Luka averaging 29ppg in their second season shouldn't have been a thing, coaches are just letting rip it whenever they want, that works on a lottery team or a middle of the pack team, but both these kids aren't curry.  When Doncic is jacking nearly 8 3s a game at a 28% clip, it doesn't matter how good his stats look at the end of the game, its hurting the team.  Also letting Luka take all the boards obviously pisses off your big man because thats literally one of his primary jobs. You aren't going to seriously tell me Luka is a better rebounder then those 7 footers with insane verts lol, they are giving them to him."
ITT: fat neckbeards crying that professional athletes including Luka Doncic and Lebron FUCKING JAMES don't behave like they want them to.
"Doncic was MVP of Euroleague, which is a much more coveted accolade than national MVP. He was also a Euroleague champion and European champion with the national team.   He was a strong contender for the #1 pick, with many draft board having him there, while Jokic was a 2nd rounder who got drafted during a Taco Bell commercial and didn't even play in the ABA league finals, let alone the Euroleague.   People were talking about Luka long before he came into the league, he was considered a top prospect from when he was 16 years old."
Vince Carter vs Luka Doncic
"Dallas is struggling right now because they got fucked hard by Covid protocols and KP injury. I mean how can you even use this as an argument to say Book is better when he never finished with even *one* positive record in his entire career? lol  The overrated Luka Doncic is on 27/9/9 splits btw, while Booker is averaging more turnovers than assists."

Lmaoo what an awful take. Yeah get rid of the Gm that got Luka doncic and get rid of the coach that developed doncic into a superstar. Y’all think before you write?
Luka Dort &gt;  Luguentz Doncic
When did I say LaMelo played in the Euroleague?  &gt;Some people have the perception the NCAA is below the Euroleague **when they talk about players who come from Europe in the draft**  Example: Luka Doncic debates when he was drafted. People thought him being the MVP of the Euroleague meant significantly less than it did.  Read comprehension please.
"Bruh can we wait till it's near the all-star selection date for dumb stuff like this? Like you said, the Heat's record is not reflective of how good they actually are, they're in a slump mired by covid restrictions, minor injuries, and some cold play. Let them ride to the trade deadline, and let's see how records look then.  That being said, I don't think you can just write off certain players because their team is underperforming. For instance, Bam Adebayo's an elite player, putting up a solid 20/9/5. Based on just those numbers, he should be in the all star discussion. I'd even argue that outside of the box score, Adebayo gives more to the Heat than guys like Julius Randle(who's having a career season for the Knicks) or Nikola Vucevic(who's got a single all-star selection, while playing at that level for the last 3-4 seasons now). You also need to take into account their position, like Bam Adebayo wouldn't take the spot of someone like Malcom Brogdan or Collin Sexton, outside of wildcards/reserves.  You give different arguments such as ""not enough games"" or just not playing ""nice enough,"" but you can't seem to give the Heat players the same excuses. What's the opposite of homerism? I'd say whatever that is, that's how you feel about the Heat players. Sure, they're not doing great, I'd for sure place guys like Sabonis, Christian Wood, or heck I'd even give Jerami Grant the spot over Jimmy Butler this season, but come on man. Cut them some slack. You and I both know 20 games isn't enough to judge a team's performances, regardless of how good one team or another has been. Do you REALLY think that the Hornets are a near .500 squad, with their current record of 10 wins and 11 losses, or do you think it has been a spell of weaker schedule, hot shooting, good synergist play, and overall luck? Do you REALLY think that Luka Doncic is going to average 29.4% from 3 for the season and miss the playoffs this season as the current 13th seed?"
Mavericks players who I would be sad to see traded  1. Luka Doncic  That's it. That's the list.
MVP candidate Luka Doncic
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Pleasant: Obese Luka Doncic. I enjoy the defense and midrange shots.  Unpleasant: I knew some teams would get screwed over by COVID, but you never expect it to be your own."
"Especially when Doncic is a trash 3P shooter himself. And I like Luka, but come on."
The other center? Luka Doncic.
Lol did OP seriously leave out Luka off this list? Most people would take Doncic over Jokic.
"Had to check and, huh  &gt; Michael Jordan was undefeated in the Finals. Luka Doncic shoots below 30% from 3  ... I don't get it."
He even has “Luka Doncic shoots below 30% from 3” in his bio.
Yes and his name is Luka Doncic
"Luka fan vote doesnt seem to be related with this. Luka is playing pretty good. Some wrong trades, 4 main rotation teammates getting covid, KP's health are not his wrongdoings. He is playing better than Conley and deserve allstar recognition for sure. There is a good chance Dallas to turn this around at least finish 6-7th or such. And Doncic will probably finish in the top 5 in MVP voting."

"Luka ""despite the rest of his team being out due to Covid, and being easily one of the best players on the court every game without them, and still losing despite great stats"" Doncic"
"There’s no question Doncic is a better player, and nobody is arguing that. But Ayton is playing like a true all star this year and who knows how Book/Luka would have fit with them both being so ball dominant. When you consider that Luka = No CP3, is Luka, Booker, and a random center (Capela maybe?) better than CP3, Booker, and Ayton? I truly don’t know the answer to that, and that’s why it could still very well have been the right pick for us."
"I’m aware we made a mistake, we should have drafted the 22 year old superstar, just as the suns should have. Ayton is a pretty good player, with the potential to maybe be an all star. Luka is already a high level all star with the potential to be the best player in the nba for the next 10 years. Ayton and doncic are not close."
Bragging about how the Knicks best player is Julius Randle while having a worse record with Luka Doncic is a key symptom of copium overdose.
"Embiid is assisted in 90% of his 3s, Luka in 31% for his career and 19% this year. Embiid also is assisted in 47% of his 2s, Doncic in 17% of his 2s."
"Mavs offensive the last 5 minutes was hard to watch. Meanwhile CP3 make clutch plays, MVP candidate Luka Doncic chokes again."
Luka “despite the loss” Doncic
"This is a dumb post. “...surprising that Carlisle is letting Doncic shoot...”.  This is nephew level.  &amp;#x200B;  It’s Luka Fucking Doncic, that’s why."
"Luka Doncic has a way higher TS than Westbrook does (56 vs 46)%. TS actually indicates how good someone is at scoring compared to 3pt shooting percentage. Westbrook is having one of his worst seasons on an abysmal efficiency, while Luka is playing at an all star level on decent efficiency ."
"&gt;Doncic fat as fuck. Won’t ever respect a player that doesn’t show up in top shape.  Maybe this is a little extreme, but yeah feel like Luka isn't putting in the work to be an all time great.  He's young though, maybe things will change"
We misunderstood each other. I was talking about Luka’s co-star compared to the Pelicans in Zion and Ingram. But I see you mean Luka Doncic is greater than whatever the Pels have.
"Luka ""White LeBron"" Doncic"
Luka Doncic the defensive monster - said no one ever
"I think you're still exaggerating the gap between the US and the rest of the world in the sport of basketball. This isn't American pigskin football. Basketball is about as accessible as soccer, a ball and two goals. People have been playing it globally for decades. There is nothing special about American bodies. The talent and athleticism is there and beginning to dominate NBA basketball. Giannis, Luka, Embiid, Jokic are MVP players, Gobert is 3x DPOY, Siakim MIP, Ben Simmons might be the best player in basketball if he could shoot well, and that scratches the surface. The institutions needed to cultivate basketball skill have been developing across every continent for the past 20 or so years. We lost in 2004, we lost in 2019, we'll lose in the future, and every time there will be excuses. We continue to imagine American teams daddying Euro teams even though Doncic came over and dad dicked the whole NBA at age 19. I'm not anti-nationalism or anything; I merely think the idea of American supremacy of basketball that fans still hold on to is becoming more and more inaccurate and will soon become deluded."

"Mavs cant be mediocre  They have the born winner, luka ""Hes just like bird"" doncic"
Joe ingles is the white Luka doncic
giannis shooting better than that fatass luka doncic
1st Team:   Stephen Curry Luka Doncic  Lebron James Kevin Durant  Joel Embiid  2nd Team:   Damian Lillard Bradley Beal Kawhi Leonard Giannis Antetekounmpo Nikola Jokic  3rd Team:   Kyrie Irving Jaylen Brown Paul George  Anthony Davis Andre Drummond
"Semi-off-topic but I had a dream last night that I was playing soccer professionally with Luka Doncic, he had a shot that hit the crossbar but he followed it so when it bounced back to him he was able to head it in before it even touched the ground. Honestly the most hype dream I've had in ages"
"The thing that imo was hardest to predict is that Luka became an overall mediocre defender within the last year. He obviously has weaknesses, but no glaring ones, which means he doesn't need to be hidden and has versatility on switches. Here ""mediocre"" doesn't mean 250th best defender, because there are far more bad defenders on NBA teams that don't play any or many minutes, but mediocre for real rotation players.  Doncic doesn't make a team defense good by himself, but he also won't make a good team defense worse and that is huge."
lukas balls didnt even drop until 2014 you think he wouldve wanted the drose smoke? you think low T luka doncic wouldve been able to harness the media narrative to win mvp over lebron and dwight like drose??? you wilding
Luka doncic
"I remember before the Kyrie trade, there was talk of Boston trading up (from the #8 pick) to try and get Doncic.  Could you imagine if Boston had Luka the Jays? ?????"
"They really don't get calls similarly at all. Luka gets most of his calls on drives to the rim, not jump shots or jumping back into people.  Trae is also averaging 3 more FTA than Luka while Doncic leads the league in drives to the rim."
"Most likely to be named all stars in the West:  LeBron James  Donovan Mitchell  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic   Damian Lillard   That leaves 2 spots. But there's heavy competition for those with guys like Morant, Booker, SGA, McCollum, Anthony Davis, Fox (just to name a few)"
"Dirk Nowitzki (1978) played his first NBA game against Dale Ellis (1960) and also played against Kevin Knox (1999). 39 year difference.   Fun other fact: Luka Doncic, who played with Dirk, is also born in 1999, however a few months before KK"
"Depends how you are measuring impact, but for the past three years he is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic. With one exception, those were the top five finishers in the 2019-20 MVP vote (Jokic was 9th), while Gobert wasn’t mentioned on a single ballot.  I prefer these kinds of metrics versus 1st all-nba ballot nods and such, but to eachs own. I get an argument against 10 impact too"
"it was 100% carlisle but the fact was the mavs had an insane net rating with doncic on the bench. Luka himself was only a +3.1 which is obviously good but not at the superstar level. Thats a not knock on him, im just saying with the bench coming down to earth we might just be seeing that luka isnt quite on that level yet even if hes putting up huge numbers by dominating the ball."
&gt;	Sixers. He was the only reason why they didn't suck last year.  Didnt realize Seth curry was our franchise player and not luka doncic
"Why would it matter? You claim to watch the team more than I do, yet I go to games, I watch every game. I watch replays of games. I could find Luka Doncic games where he scored the entire time on below average players, none of that shit would matter or take away from how great of a player he is. Zion is objectively a tremendous scorer."
"I would say go after a player then and follow them. The OG is Lebron. Go watch him and root for lakers. If you want a young player that will be around a while go look at Luka Doncic, Ja Morant, Giannis. What kind of play style are you into?"
"""Luka Doncic selflessly throws game for charity""  -Espn, probably"
He has a Mavs Luka Doncic flair

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."

Trae Young  19-20:  1. Coby White  2. Kendrick Nunn  They're all volume shooter iso players besides Shamet. 3pt specialists just don't get that many shots as rookies."
"Must be nice to beat Luka Doncic and the Dallas washed, UDFAs and Backups  Really excited for you guys to have KPJ though - as you said he’s a HUGE part of this bright future for the Rockets"
"I felt bad for Doncic after the WCS signing, if that man had an average BBIQ he'd be getting like 15ppg off of Luka PnR but he's just so damn clueless on the court."
"I was looking through all time regular season leader boards today.  I was surprised to find out that three players in the top 15 in career triple-doubles are 25 years old or younger.  Jokic (9th, age 25), then Ben Simmons (age 24) and Luka Doncic (age 21) are tied for 14th place all time.  It is hard for me to believe a 21 year old can be top 15 all time in career triple-doubles... not bad."
What about luka doncic? Or do they just hate him because he is white?
"Draft day was fucking crazy in 2018. I was celebrating so hard when the Kings picked Bagley and I knew that Doncic was falling to the Hawks, and then I lost my mind when they announced the trade to the Mavs after Atlanta picked Luka. I had seen Trae play from really good seats against TCU and drop 40 points and 10 assists including game winning free throws at the last second, so I was really high on him too. Never seen anyone come close to that production in a college game."
My wife and I both get 1 hallpass and for both of us it is Luka Doncic
And that's why he's known as Hawks legend Luka Doncic
"wym lol. like i’m sorry has this kid not put up enough 30pt triple doubles as a child to be projected as an all time great if he continues on his current path?  what does a guy have to do, to be projected as an all time great player in your eyes? does he literally have to fucking become one, before these convos are had? you do realize that before kobe proved he could win 5 rings and dominate the league for 10+ years, observant fans of the game, were accurately predicting he could do this very thing, right?  are you surrounded by talent the likes of luka doncic or something? have we been watching a different nba? is this what makes you so hesitant to open your eyes and see that something special is happening in front of you?"
Luka Doncic
For a few seconds there Luka Doncic was Luka Modric
Luka is gonna go for 30 while Doncic gets shut out.
"Yeah no shit they don't want to get rid of their best player. Why is this even an article?  ""Word around the league is the Mavericks have no interest in trading Luka doncic. Also, we're receiving reports that the Lakers intend to do 'everything in their power' to keep LeBron James and Anthony Davis. More updates as this story unfolds"""
*has player on their team currently averaging a triple double*  *picks Luka Doncic instead*
"On/off is how the team does when you are on the court compared to off (ie on the bench). For example if you have a net rating of +3.0 this is really good, but if your team has a net rating of +5.0 when you aren't on the court than this means your team statistically did better with you off the court. It is good for gauging players on bad teams. For example, Khris Middleton was on some bad teams early in his career in Detroit and those early Bucks teams before Giannis broke out. He always made his team better and had really good on/off which shows that even those he was on a bad team, he made that bad team a fair bit better.  It isn't just good for net rating, it is also good for rebounds. There are players like Luka Doncic or pretty much every other high rebounding guard in the NBA that gobble up a bunch of uncontested rebound but barely influence their teams rebounding. If you compare that to Steven Adams who averages less rebounds but makes his team significantly better at rebounds you can see that Steven Adams is a great player to have on the court in terms of rebounding.  On/off biggest advantage is that it takes into account how your team plays compared to with you and without you as in the end, team performance is all that matter. This is also its biggest disadvantage though so it can be influenced by small sample sizes and noise or if you have a really good player on your bench (for example Jaren Jackson Jr's on/off is pretty bad since they got Brandon Clarke)."
"This is  pretty  cool,  have any  of you  seen  the Wibbets profile  on Luka Doncic?"
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
Oh don’t get me wrong I wasnt saying Luka is a worse shooter than Russ because that is asinine   I just posted Russ’s percentage to show that Luka has been struggling this year when it’s Russ that’s normally in the 20s from 3  Doncic does take some tough fucking 3s tho so cleaning that up should help
"For all my peeps who don't read articles  &gt;The Cavs are no longer asking Sexton to be a point guard. They drafted him at no. 8 in 2018 and gave him the keys to the offense as a rookie, but that was never his game. He’s not Luka Doncic or Trae Young, who can score and pass at a high level. Sexton walks on the court for only one reason.   Basically he is just comparing them as PG to SG."
"Why are we pretending that Crowder and IT alone got them all those players, that's not what happened at all.   If I trade Semi Ojeleye for a second round pick and then package that pick with a bunch of other stuff for like fuckin Luka Doncic, I'm not gonna turn around and say that I traded Semi Ojeleye for Doncic"
a) It's hilarious to see a Cavs game have 10X as many comments in the game thread as a game with Luka Doncic in it vs a good team.   b) Harden hasnt taken single digit shots in a game in 4 yrs. At 6 through 3 quarters
"Luka ""Not Fun To Watch"" Doncic at it again"
"\*passes Doncic billboard\*  ""He doesn't even have that in his own country.  Trust me, I know.""  So fucking good.  I would trade mad pieces to get Luka to the nuggets."
Dame absolutely deserved to be a starter over Luka. Love Doncic but just speaks to how disgustingly stacked the West is
It's honor of Luka Doncic losing 7 pounds for the All-Star game.

New European basketball hope Luka Doncic evaluates his predecessor's past legacy as he readies himself to build an even greater legacy.
"&gt; Per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com, the Dallas Mavericks feel Love would fix the problems they have had with three-point shooting and defensive rebounding:  &gt;”A source with knowledge of the Mavericks' thinking suggested Kevin Love as a much better fit [than Andre Drummond] given the team's 3-point woes and desire to surround MVP candidate Luka Doncic with shooters. Love would also help boost Dallas' problematic defensive rebounding metrics. Still, the Mavericks have two appealing expiring contracts—Tim Hardaway Jr. ($18 million) and James Johnson ($16 million)—that would help facilitate a deal.""  I apologize for the shitty headline, but I didn’t want to editorialize the link - I tried googling other sources, but only found even shittier headlines.  A “strong” fit =\= a better fit than Drummond"

For the 1980s, Jordan could have been included, but he didn’t win back then. Same with LeBron in the 2000s"
Doncic wants none you our Luka
"My guy. I really don’t feel like you’re being rational here. Your whole point is just saying that the NBA is impossibly difficult and fast, but you’re disregarding the fact that NBA players are able to keep up with it. The NBA is only so fast *because* the players are also fast, smart, and able to play at that pace. You’re telling me Luka Doncic can make a no-look cross-court pass directly into a shooter’s pocket in transition, but he couldn’t tell you which of his 4 teammates he just perfectly passed to? Like, my whole point is just that the ability to identify 1 of 4 human beings is incredibly easy compared to the other shit the guys pull off on a regular basis."
"Ahh yes, a good game by &lt;put Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, or Luka Doncic here&gt; always brings out these questions and the Giannis haters such as /u/gunter_grass"
"I like KAT too but eh, he ain’t enough for a play off push in the west, not without a much better second option than D’Lo plus a deeper squad. This is why a guy like Luka Doncic is so damn special."
"Giannis and LeBron are better finishers when driving than SGA and Luka, but they do it at a lower volume. I don't think either of those groups is better. Although Doncic is better than SGA as he creates more points for himself in fewer drives at a higher FG% and also more assists with the same amount of turnovers."
And Trae young is still as good as Luka doncic amirtie? Hahaha
"I pray for both LDs, Luka Doncic and Luguentz Dort."

"generational talent is kind of subjective, leaving open ended discussions like this open for the game.   Literally speaking yes you have the obvious   MJ Kobe Tim Duncan  Larry Bird Magic Lebron  Luka Doncic"
"As someone who is actually a very big Russ fan and think his only real problem is turnovers , Doncic is already a better player than Brodie .   Doncic is 100 percent a team player , at times to a fault . Doncic could stand to be a little more Westbrook in some games even . But let’s be honest the guys around him are okay at best . Klieber is inconsistent as all hell this year . Dorian Finny-Smith has been more or less a bust this year . Kristaps isn’t able to play the Defense at the 5 that you want in the west . Jokic , Gobert , Nurk , even old man Lamarcus pushes KP in the paint.   This team is dead last without Luka and just looking at the guys around him shooting stats , eff % , and + / - would tell ya that.  Luka is special to be cooking the way he is at his age . But let’s not forget LeBron James wasnt exactly dragging the Cavs to finals every year in his early 20s either and we all know how that turned out."
"A question with no answer, the price for Chris Paul is obviously going to be different than Luka Doncic."
"Hello, Luka Doncic"
"Dario ""Luka Doncic"" Saric"
I wanna give a sincere s/o to Luka Doncic AKA the second best Luka in Texas.
"Idk about underrated. Harden undoubtedly has a huge impact, but he’s been toxic his whole career. I will say that he has impressed me with Brooklyn so far and he seems to be breaking some old habits.   But Harden’s unwillingness to play off-ball has been absurd for so long. He won’t even make the simple pass—he only passes the ball if its got assist potential. This doesn’t make him a bad player by any means but it does basically take his teammates out of the game, turning them into tools that occasionally are called upon, which is frustrating to watch for fans of team basketball. His tendency to draw touchy fouls from beyond the arc and get away with travels is also annoying. He also forced his star teammates off his team and then demanded a trade because his team isn’t good enough. This is why he’s disliked on the sub, but disliked is different from underrated.  As for the influence he’s had on Trae Young and Luka Doncic—a lot of the traits they’ve picked up from Harden are not necessarily good things. Both players need to learn to make the smart, simple pass, and to play off ball.   Lastly, to your point on Curry—talent level, sure, but Curry doesn’t drive his teammates away. Draymond and Harden?? That’s not a team, that’s a fight.   So I don’t really agree with that."
"If you just watch these 4 different players you'd know the difference.  Trae at a point was doing this flopping shit on every jump shot, every drive. There's multiple points where he's lost games due to looking for calls instead of just looking to make a shot.  There's also shit like [this](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/02/10/0022000384/631/9f95c252-04e0-21df-f8a8-bb427672d715_1280x720.mp4). This is not the type of shit you should pull at clutch time. Due to him doing this the Mavs got a fast break and his team had to foul.  Lloyd Pierce is also not the coach of Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, and James Harden."

Why didn't they open an investigation when Montrez was racist towards Luka Doncic?
"35% after 33% and 32% the last two years? Sounds like *Fluka* Doncic to me.   Fun fact: Bagley is a career 32.5% sniper compared to Bitch-Ass White Boy's 32.7%, so if MB3 hits his first triple tonight, he'll pass Luka and the debate will finally be settled once and for all. And they're playing the Pistons, so you know he'll be wide open."

"Luka is big enough to play SG, imagine the fast man slow man combo that could come out of Fox/Doncic. When you want to run half court sets you get Doncic to run the show and when there's fast breaks you give it to Fox and get Luka to stand on the perimeter for a kick out. If the break falls apart, Luka still has the ball and can transition into a set play.   Plus both are deadly af drivers and are foul magnets. There's literally endless offensive combos there and they fuckin drafted Bagley smh"
"&gt; He’s shooting a league average TS% despite being a poor FT shooter who doesn’t shoot many FT’s per game. That’s a good thing.  How is being bad at getting to the line not a bad thing? Deandre Ayton is also terrible at getting to the line (even worse than Wiggins) so I don't go around bragging that Ayton very efficient especially if you consider he can't get to the line. Luka Doncic and Trae Young ability to get to the line help their TS% greatly but we don't go around and say ""well they get to the line a lot so it shouldn't be factored"". Wiggins inability to get to the line is on him.  &gt;And yes, shooting 1% than his career high is a big improvement  No it is not. Shooting 1% higher than your career high, or 2-3% higher than your career average can often just be statistical noise and the general variance year to year. Also considering the fact that he is playing with the best PG of this generation, I would have actually expected a much bigger jump.   &gt;Wiggins’s TS% was under 52% in 3/5 seasons.  Ya because he was on teams with low gravity and he was 19 or 20 years old on two of those season.  &gt;Draymond could shoot 40% from 3 this year and you would say he hasn’t shown a big improvement with your logic because that only beats his career high 5 years ago by 1%  That would be an 8% jump from his career average. That is equivalent to 12% increase in true shooting from his career average. Not 2% like Wiggins.  &gt;Saying someone’s efficiency sucks because he misses half point per game on FT% is just dumb and clearly shows you have an agenda to pus  The only agenda I have against is stupidity."
"Donald Trump called Luka Doncic after the game stating ""Bad things happen in Philadelphia""."
We drafted Obi over Deni Avdija and Devin Vassell. You drafted Marvin Bayley over Luka Doncic and Trae young. Nice try tho
How would anyone even take that narrative seriously? Just like people saying Larry Bird won't survive cause he is too slow and can't jump. Then you see Luka Doncic destroying the NBA. I think a dominant athlete with incredible technique and a high basketball IQ like Jordan can adapt and eventually destroy zone defenses.
"I consider Luka Doncic to be a Steve Nash type player. Passing is his best quality except he can also score 30 at will, if that makes any sense lol"
"Simmons is ok on Luka, but the Sixers double-  and triple-team Doncic, it is by no means just 1 vs 1.  Gobert is DPOY because center defense is just more important and Embiid and Howard are more impactful in this very game going on right now."
"Gm's thought Luka was at his ceiling &amp; couldn't get better at 18 lmfao. kid won Eurocup with Slovenia at 17 destroying KP &amp; Latvia en route to beating Gasols Spain, MVP of the Spanish league, Euroleague MVP &amp; Final Four MVP.   Everyone in Europe knew he was up next as the heir to Balkan Basketball God Drazen Petrovic. Every GM in the top 10 of that draft should have been sacked, everyone in Europe was raving about Doncic since he was a child how could NBA GM not know."
"Harden has by every metric been a better point guard than Curry since joining the Nets, and how tf has Harden not been the best player on the Nets lmao. Durant hasnt even been playing.  1.

"Seems like this is becoming a theme in the last couple NBA games. Terry Rozier buzzer beater 3, Luka Doncic buzzer beater 3, and now Dort."
"No, that's Jokic. Green is great, but most of his passes are hand-offs, simple passes to Curry coming off a screen, or hitting the backdoor cut when the defense overplays. Jokic has a much greater variety of passes (i.e. he throws it Luka Doncic style cross court to an open shooter, no look passes that actually trick the defense, etc.). And no one is better at passing to cutters than Jokic; the way he threads the needle is just ridiculous.   Draymond is a great point forward and passer, but Jokic is already among the greatest passers of all time. For the numbers on this: [Ben Taylor's analysis of Jokic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okIwFBdbEOc)"
"Saddiq Bey, Bradley Beal, Nikola Jokic, Trae Young, Trae Young, Brandon Ingram, Luka Doncic and……  Danilo fucking Gallinari"
He’s right around that that Doncic/Lillard zone. Better scorer than Luka but not on the same level passing wise.
"Luka ""James Harden"" Doncic"
"&gt;yet people still act like Doncic was snubbed by not being picked first.  The best player of the draft SHOULD have gone first, so yeah him falling to a 3rd pick was a snub.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;just because you have the benefit of hindsight doesn’t make people who  didn’t have the same opinion as you stupid or incompetent.  I don't contest the fans, my problem is with GMs and scouts whose job is literally to evalute talent and yet they allowed their european bias let Doncic slip to the 3rd place and to be traded for a player picked fifth.  Better for Luka in the end though, he landed in the perfect scenario for him."
"He's gonna coach his favorite son, Luka Doncic"
"You act like picking Doncic when he was picked was somehow a genius move.   Leading up to the draft there was never a consensus on who the first pick should be, and I’m tired of people pretending like it was obvious Luka was the better choice at the time. It’s straight up disingenuous. The fact is, people had doubts about another Euro prospect that was touted to be the next big thing. Couple with the fact that Phoenix had a bigger need for a Center, and you have a decision that made sense in the moment."
Is no one gonna talk about the Boston bench? As soon Luka got the ball they all stood up to signal to guard Doncic.

Luka Doncic
"I mean there's not many young players that averaged 20/28/29 ppg respectively in their first 3 seasons since 18 years old while being a great playmaker and triple double machine, and he shoots okay, his shot selection needs work but really he's shooting from the 3 like Beal isn't he?   He also proved he can perform in the playoffs, the problem is can the rest of his team and front office step up because in 2-3 years I can see a Luka Doncic version of ""The Decision"" but more terrible"

"It's pretty large. JT is great, but Luka is a significant enough improvement on playmaking to make him a much better first option  26/7/5 on 56% TS for Tatum  29/9/9 on 58% TS for Doncic  Tatum is a better defender fwiw"
Luka doncic averaging 8.6? Wow...

"The first thing I would recommend is looking at the standings:  [https://www.espn.com/nba/standings](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings)  This will give you a good idea of the ""exciting teams"".  Next, i would check the National TV schedule for games with these top teams as they are typically going to be the most exciting games:  [https://www.espn.com/nba/schedule](https://www.espn.com/nba/schedule)  I would recommend watching the Philadelphia 76ers vs Dallas Mavericks game that is on ESPN on Monday April 12th.     These are two teams hoping to compete for a title this year. They also have two of the MVP candidates :       Joel Embiid (76ers) - he is the 7' center for PHI. In the past, centers were usually just big guys who would be there to lay in easy shots near the basket. Embiid is a good representation of the way the league is headed. He can shoot 3pointers, he can handle the ball well (most centers cant/wont). Hes all around a fun, exciting player to watch.       Luka Doncic (Mavericks) - Luka is one of the youngest stars in the NBA. He has been compared to LeBron James by some people (who is considered a Top 3 player all time).  \---       I would just watch the majority of this game keeping your eye on these two players. I would listen to the announcers who are sometimes pretty good at giving extra details you may not have noticed (like why something was a good or bad shot, etc.).       Most of all, watch the body language of both teams. See if one team looks bored or if one team seems to be having a ton of fun. Honestly nomentum is one of the core parts of NBA basketball in my opinion.            \---  After watching that, id recommend taking a look at this years All Star teams:  https://www.nba.com/2021-all-star-roster  Familairizing yourself with the big names in the league makes the games a lot more fun and easy to get into.  While you can definitely appreciate games between ""bad teams"" without stars, i think its a lot tougher for new fans to get into because theres not the same ""energy"" and excitement that star players bring"

"Being closer to the rim is the strongest predictor of rebounds. You can track it yourself here: [https://www.nba.com/stats/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&amp;dir=1](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&amp;dir=1)  Out of all starting guards in the league, the only ones with a closer rebound distance than Westbrook are Luka Doncic (who is realistically a forward who tends to guard 3s) and Will Barton (same).  Contrast other point guards who are considered to be strong rebounders like Curry, Lowry and LaMelo and you'll find they all get their rebounds from 7 feet or beyond.   I don't doubt that Westbrook is an elite rebounder - he has the technique and the motor for it. You can watch any Westbrook games and you'll notice it. But you also need to admit that he achieves this by defending closer to the rim."
Kings......Luka Doncic....  Sigh
They drafted Marvin Bagley instead of Luka Doncic.
The Mavs and Luka Doncic are 29-22 since the first game of the season
Did you know Jokic doesn’t get fouls and Luka Doncic is 69/69 for his last 20 games?   Crazy times we live in

Luka Doncic. Was arguably a HOFer before his rookie year.
Luka Doncic
"I love Jalen, and I hope he keeps improving as a player and become an even bigger value to the team.  Having said that, he's most likely in that JJ Barea role going forward of being a phenomenal 6th man who can light a spark under the team and push us forward when the starters are resting...  But I don't see him as a perennial starter on a team that wants to go for glory.  But on the other hand, with Doncic being a guy that operates best with the ball in his hands, we don't need a traditional ball-heavy guard either. And John Wall would be a poor fit.  For all intents, Luka IS the Point Guard for the Mavs and that won't change. They need to keep building around him by adding more capable players who Doncic can play off.  Jalen works well in that regard too, he's a great spot shooter on top of being able to handle the ball when Luka isn't on the court. 84% of his made 3s come off an assist, too.  The thing that the Mavs need most is probably a secondary playmaker, who can get assists if Luka is not on the court or otherwise not able to set others up."

"But seriously yes.   I’ve watched every suns game the last 3 years. I watched the suns be a shit stain of the NBA. A complete dumpster fire would be a compliment.   The Suns are a top team. With back to back Ws against the nuggets and jazz, 2-0 vs the leagues top team (for now), Ws against the Bucks, the 76ers, the Blazers, and the leagues best road record, an 8-0 bubble record, AND FRANK FUCKING KAMINSKY?   of course they are contenders.   Devin Booker has been embarrassing every single fucking defense this year with midrange mastery.  Chris Paul is State Farm.   Mikal Bridges puts the clamps on the opposing teams star day in and day out.   Luka Doncic is 1-7 vs. Deandre Ayton.   As an AZ sports fan, the real test comes in the playoffs where AZ sports always fall short, unless it’s the Phoenix Mercury or 2001 diamondbacks.   You’re god damn right we’re contenders."
Looked pretty good against okc when doncic was out he doesn’t get to play in the post because Luka dribbles so much. Luka gets 30 but his man gets 25. Offensively he’s great but I think lamelo will be a first ballot HoF mvp type as well btw I’d put doncic over dame and giannis so it’s not like I don’t like Luka I just love lamelos intangibles and assuming he plays d and shoots like his brother along with his speed intangibles and confidence he’ll be a true unicorn and a quicker better shooting version of Kidd/ Gary Payton. People make the bird comparison with Luka but bird was 7 ft.
"Doncic and KP have great moments but late in games it falls apart, largely in part due to Luka chucking up hero ball shots. He’s made some and missed some for sure, gotta hone that aspect of his game he ain’t Steph or lillard from downtown (yet)"
"Luka barely outright flops, he complains a lot and embellishes substantial contact. Doncic does not get superstar calls, which is inconsistent with the usual NBA officiating, but not without precedent (Giannis e.g. had this for a long time, Dame imo as well)."
"This year Lamelo has been:  1. The youngest player to record a triple double.  2. The youngest player to make 7 threes in a game.  3. One of three rookies to make 7 threes and dish 10 assists in a game  4. Only rookie in the last 60 years to lead all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals heading into the all-star break.  5. One of three NBA players age 20 or younger to have multiple 20/10/5 games (the other two being Lebron James and Luka Doncic).  6. One of three rookies to record 7 threes and 10 assists in a game (the other two being Steph Curry and Jason Kid).  7. One of two rookies to average 15/5/5 and 2 threes (the other rookie being Luka Doncic).  8. Per 36, one of two rookies to post 18/6/6 for a season (the other being a Oscar Robertson; less impressive if he doesn’t play again this year).  That is literally the definition of historic.  Before he went down he was the prohibitive favorite to win ROY. Sports media regularly said at the point he went down that it was his to lose.   [This article does a pretty good job putting his season into perspective](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fansided.com/2021/03/03/nylon-calculus-comparing-lamelo-ball-greatest-nba-rookies-ever/amp/)  Games missed going to be his biggest black mark, but with an injury unlikely to inhibit his growth going forward and how he was head and shoulders better than every other rookie, in the eyes of many a stat nerd he’s done enough to be deserving of ROY. Don’t think he gets it but we all know who the best rookie this year was."
"I think lamelo passes better than doncic he’s also a winner something Luka didn’t do as a rookie.  Kyrie has outplayed Steph in every series they’ve ever played in and hit the greatest shot in nba finals history in stephs face, and dominated him the entire series. Kyrie is currently at the age Steph was when he started winning mvps so he’s just now hitting his prime. A “mvp” really only matters to geeks who are to into numbers Steph has never been better than or “more valuable “ than lebron James so it’s just a piece of hardware. I’m also taking into my anticipation how rough these next couple years will be for the warriors. I see consecutive first round exits even with klay back. We will never see Curry on the warriors play in a conference finals again while Kyrie will be in a national championship spotlight for at least the next 3 years maybe more he’s only 29."

These guys are so young and good that we have an accelerated timeline for them.   But these early 20-year-olds have no real-life experience to be leading a bunch of gritty men who's seen all the bullshit and the ups and downs."

"And he’s older that Luka lol. Just goes to show how awesome Luka Doncic is and how he’s a young goat in the making. Did you know he almost averaged a triple double in his **second season?** Insane, the standards on him at such a young age is unprecedented, and he handles it with absolute class. Idk about you, but he’s the type of guy I’d want my daughter dating; first one into the McDonalds; last one out"

&gt; Are those fans like two weeks old or something?  basically yes. We have LOTS of new fans that were Luka doncic fans who are brand new to the NBA
"You guys recently just got Luka Doncic, probably thousands of bandwagon fans that just joined because of the hype.  Same thing happened with Raptors after 2016, lotsss of new obnoxious Raptors fan with horrible takes"
&gt;the best player on the floor in Luka Doncic.  Suns abuse Luka Doncic similar to how most teams abuse Enes Kanter. Just terrible on defense and makes it very easy for the Suns to win even when they fielded terrible teams these last 3 years.   &gt;The Nets were 4-0 on LeBron during the 2013-2014 season and lost 4-1 during the playoffs.   The Nets didn't have like +5 advantage in net rating over Lebron though I imagine. This isn't just the case where one team does much better than the other team when they vs each other in a sample size but worse against every other team. The Suns have been a much better team overall with the 2nd best net rating in the league and 2nd best record. Even if you only look at the timeframe when Mavs were mostly healthy since like February Suns have also been much better as well. The Heat were the 2nd seed while the Nets were the 6th. If you want to go by the 2013-2014 season the Suns would be like the Heat and the Mavs would be like the Bobcats who were 7th seed. The Heat had the better record on average vs everyone as well as vs the Bobcats.
"I can see why Doncic won Player of the Week for the West but I wanted to give a shoutout to Booker because it was very close.  Luka Doncic: (4-0 vs OKC, BOS, NYK, WAS): 28.3 ppg, 6.75 rpg, 6.25 apg on 54.4/40.5/52.2 percent shooting splits  Devin Booker: (4-0) vs CHO, ATL, CHI, OKC): 33.3 ppg, 3.75 rpg, 3.75 apg on 51.7/39.3/93.8 percent shooting splits"
The Nets were 4-0 on LeBron during the 2013-2014 season and lost 4-1 during the playoffs. You never know how defenses/offenses adjust over a 7-game series and I trust Carlisle to be able to adjust better than Monty while the game is going on - and it also helps to have the best player on the floor in Luka Doncic.
"I can see why they gave it Player of the Week to Doncic but I wanted to give Booker a shoutout for his performance. He's seen a reduction in his counting stats this year but the team has been balling out:  Luka Doncic (4-0 vs OKC, BOS, NYK, WAS): 28.3 ppg, 6.75 rpg, 6.25 apg on 56.0/38.4/47.2 shooting.  Devin Booker: (4-0 vs CHO, ATL, CHI, OKC): 33.3 ppg, 3.75 rpg, 3.75 apg on 51.6/41.3/95.4 shooting."

"So funny to see Ingles crying over that foul. His own medicine!  Ingles even whined for the foul he made on Doncic as he basically hugged him. It was after a scuffle, tech.foul possession so Ingles tried to jingle Luka but he got jingled as Luka showed the foul."

"1.Giannis is in the East and Luka its only in his 3rd season so yeah he went further but that still dont say nothing.Giannis isnt a complete player and i dont see him dominate as a 1st option. We all seen how easily he got locked in the last 3 years where Luka couldnt get locked by Kawhi,PG,Morris and Bev all togheter.   2.Where did i said that Luka is over Jokic and Embiid right now? i said they in the same tier.   Luka beats Jokic everytime they meet and Embiid cant playmake. Its clearly that some of yall dont know much about basketball.   Being a 3 level scorer and a playmaker is the most important playstyle in the league and only 3 guys are doing that right now(Lebron,Harden and Luka).Defense aint that important and specially in this age. You can cover Luka easily on defense and plus like i said he isnt a black hole from there like Trae,Dame,Curry etc.   I know u are mad that Doncic is on Mavs but still be realistical.Luka was 1st team all nba in his 2nd season. Only legends did that,he is on the way to top 15/10 all time like Magic,Bird and all the greats."

"&gt;Luka, and Doncic"
"Of course it is, but it’s also up to those franchises to invest time and effort into scouting outside of America. Not to mention a lot of the names on your list were drafted by teams that are notoriously terrible at drafting. Suns and Knicks for instance.   Plus it’s not entirely fair to reference some of these players even just based on individual performances. Porzingis was ROTY and he’s a star, Mudiay got better with time, Exum’s career was ruined by injuries, and Saric is a starting caliber guy. The rest were busts for sure, but again it’s more of a scouting issue. There are very talented international players in each draft and they almost always get overlooked. Due to the style of play and physicality they might take longer than usual to develop, but there’s elite talent, and I hope that Giannis, Luka, and Doncic, can prove that to the league for the next decade with actual championships."

Luka was 10000000 percent a lock pick at 2. 0 hesitation. The ones that said otherwise was basically vlade and you. I remember hearing from every podcast how surprising it was if a pick. And every news outlet saying it was smokescreen with bagley bc it was so obviously gotta be doncic.  Get that faulty memory looked at my man...

"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Stephen Curry 4. Nikola Jokic 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Anthony Davis 10. Luka Doncic 11. Damian Lillard  Right off the top of my head, im sure a couple players could be swapped if I sat down for a couple hours and and used more than the eye test and knowledge readily available. BIG believer in Jokic, but I truly feel 2-7 is interchangeable. Took playoffs into account but I didnt pin my whole argument on them. Hardest to rank was Kawhi, hes damn good but I feel like his impact in the regular season is lacking and he is an overrated playoff performer after last years utter failure. 9-11 could also be swapped around."
De'aron Fox/  Tyrese Haliburton/  Luka Doncic/  Harrison Barnes/  Richaun Holmes/   Sheesh that line-up could compete with anyone in the league. Legitimately one BPA away in 2018.  If you're going to pick Bagley at least trade back to pick-up an asset to compensate for your dumb ass pick.

Kings select doncic 2nd. Not “kings magically get luka on the roster.” The prophecy was shit on by that dumb sack of shit vlade
"I don't know why you chose just the last 5 games when using his entire season is a much more valid example with a decent 394 shots and he's only making 34.3% of them.   He's really been bad this season for a guy perceived as a shooter. For reference, Luka ""awful shot selection"" Doncic is at least 35.5% on **533** 3PA so far and he's gotten way more shit for his shooting this season when you could easily argue Trae and Luka are equally forced to take those last second shots or heavily contested shots or creating their own looks compared to other 3-pt shooters that are mostly catch and shoot"
Big boy Luka Doncic!
"&gt; some kid idolises Malcom Brogdon or Goran Dragic  yeah, his name is Luka. he was a ball boy when the Dragon played with Sasha Doncic in the Adriatic League in Slovenia"
Imagine passing on Luka Doncic in the midst of this streak
"Who cares about what was said at the time of the draft? Scouts are wrong all the time, as seen by Doncic dropping to #3.  Based on what has actually happened, the 2018 draft has produced a historically dominant prospect (Luka) , and several others with All-NBA/All-Star talent. Its a huge stretch to assume that this upcoming class will even come close to that, much less compare it to the 2003 class."
I always tell my doncic fan friend that Luka should take the QO and get the hell outta Dallas. If he plays in NY he's gonna be the next MJ in terms of global influence
Luka Doncic
"I agree with passer. But you're forgetting one of the most important aspects in basketball. Handling the ball, Luka does that as good as anyone in the league, which means he's a much better playmaker. Jokic isn't capable of handling like that due to his size. Post play is not modern or efficient basketball, post defence isn't even respected nowadays. Doncic play style is thoroughly modern basketball, he runs every Offensive set and also abuses mismatches in the post"
"I don't know dude, pretty sure if you haven't won by 23 your basically never going to win. Its clear based on all the reactions hot takes on this sub reddit that every team should win championships by the time players hit their mid 20s or else.they are busts. Look at the last 5 or 6 championship teams. They where lead by legendary young players like Kyle Kuzma, and Og Anunoby. Guys like matthew dellavedova and nick young. Guys like Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Zion williamson, Devin Booker, are over the hump has beens that missed their chance to compete in this league"

Luka creates more point per possession than Trae this year. And the Ast/TOs ratio is not all that define a playmaker and it is not too far by the two!  Last year when Trae had better stats was worst than Luka as overall creation so I assume this year is the same. That's the article about that: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james  From last year I think Harden and Jokic have improved in playmaking and also Steph would be in the mix. Last year Trea was 5th by Points created so this year he should be top 7 as I said.
wdym bro Harden is innocent unlike Luka doncic who tried to assassinate Sexton future children
Russell Westbrook leads the league in clutch shooting success. Luka Doncic is 32nd.  https://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnPlayerSplit.php
"1) They are not different. A triple double occurs when a player achieves 10+ points, 10+ rebounds, and 10+ assists in a single game. There is no other factor going into a triple double.  2) Doncic's are not more consistent. Russell Westbrook has achieved a triple double in 57% of his games this season. Luka Doncic has achieved a triple double in 16% of his games this season. Russell Westbrook has more triple doubles this season than Luka Doncic has over all three of his seasons combined.  3) The reason why they appear more impressive to you is likely that you like Luka Doncic as a player more than you like Russell Westbrook."

"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from a week ago so even if he's eclipsed some of these players since then, the point still stands."

imagine if they just had Richaun Holmes..  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   and Luka Doncic
Dillon Brooks locked down Luka Doncic r/nba hates to see it.
"From Tunisia, small country in North Africa.  I knew a little bit about the NBA, mainly a few player names and played some 2K on my PS2 ( I was shit at it ). I started watching at the end of the 2018 conference finals when my best friend was over at my house and he had started following a bit before me. I like Lebron and thought he was gonna be my guy going forward. Then I heard about a certain wonder boy joining the draft. I'm a diehard Real Madrid fan in football and had heard the name Luka Doncic before obviously, so I decided to follow him due to that Real Madrid connection. I won't say I'm a Mavs fan necessarily at the moment, but they're growing on me a lot, especially with the curent roster that just seems so fun and lovable and have great chemistry. I think if Luka remains there for at least 5 more years I can see myself becoming a Mavs fan, similarly to how I started watching Real Madrid because of Cristiano Ronaldo and now I'm die hard Madridista."
"So here's my (super short) timeline:  15-16 I hopped on the Warriors bandwagon and learned to like basketball. I always love watching pinnacle athletes of sports and when it comes to Basketball I valued seeing amazing shooters over dunking / floor running at the time.   16-17 started following some other teams like the Knicks (I was playing with them in my 2k career mode), Wizards, and the Mavs. Funny enough, I didn't really like the Mavs that much because I think their logo/name/location was meh (sorry mavs fans, I'm not texan), but I liked their players.   From there on I mostly stuck to Warriors games until 2(3? I forget, I smoke a loooooot of weed) seasons ago this dude called Luka Doncic decided to show everyone what Balkans can do, and me being both balkan and shamelessly biased I latched on to that and here I am as an admittedly casual Mavs (and still a Warriors) fan."
Luka Doncic will beat it for sure.
"Luka Doncic is the most talanted young player since Bron and everyone who is denying it just stupid or insane.  Oh, and by the time he retires, he'll be a top 5 player of all time."
"I live in Ohio, my first time ever sitting down and really getting invested in a basketball game was watching LeBron and the Cavs get bounced out of the playoffs by the Magic. Decide I'm going to start giving a shit about basketball because I never cared that much about watching any sports before that. LeBron makes his ***Decision*** and heads to South Beach. Young child version of me now views LeBron as a traitor and hates him. Randomly stumble upon the Thunder, fall in love with KD. Also really enjoy Harden, and to a lesser degree Russ and Serge. Harden gets traded, Serge gets traded, KD ends up leaving so I decide I'm done with the Thunder since none of the guys I actually loved are on the team anymore, decide I'm going to be a fan of whatever team KD joins........ except for **THAT** team. Can't be the biggest bandwagon fan of all time, despite having a decent excuse for following KD to GSW. Decide I'm going to find another group of promising young studs that I can hitch my wagon to before they blow up and I can watch them grow throughout their careers and hopefully we can all flourish together. Those promising young studs? KAT and Wiggins..... at least one of them is panning out.   Now I'm just here, living in Ohio, rooting for Minnesota and banking on Anthony Edwards to turn this franchise around forreal and lead us to the promised lands.... or at least the playoffs. Still not a LeBron guy but I don't hate him like I did when I was a kid. Still a big KD guy tho. Also, love Luka Doncic."
"It's very easy.  Luka Doncic 8M  James Harden 40.8M  OG Anunoby 3.8M  Giannis Antetokounmpo 27.5M  Nikola Jokic 28.5M  Total 108.6M  If you mean for the whole roster, just swap out Harden with Donovan Mitchell who makes 5.2M and fill the rest in."
"You aren’t providing any proof. It’s just pure conjecture.  Per 538: Doncic had 2.1 higher offensive box score, 1.7 higher defensive box score, 5.6 worse offensive on/off, 4.3 better defensive on/off Overall RAPTOR - Luka is .3 better offensively and 2.2 better defensively  WAR - Luka is a full 3.4 better   Virtually all of the advanced stats go Luka’s way. You cannot simply state that Trae would somehow be better if they switched positions. Imagine Trae next to Seth, Burke or Hardaway. Dallas would have been run out of the building on defense."

Luka Doncic: *leans forward in chair playing video games meme*
"Nah, one got rescinded weeks ago.  Even ESPN [says so elsewhere.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31418759/luka-doncic-tossed-flagrant-2-foul-one-technical-away-suspension) 16 would have meant a suspension."
seems to be alrady at 16  [https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/\_/id/3945274/luka-doncic](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic)  look below
"&gt;Luka has 0.17949 triple doubles per game.  Triple doubles are continuing to become [more frequent](https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgwNzkxNDQ2ODUxMjk4NjY0/triple-double-chart-edit.webp), and there's no reason to think that trend will slow down any time soon.  Doncic has 27 triple doubles in 123 games in the last 2 seasons. At that rate. he'd  only need 910 games to reach 200 triple doubles."
"It's also unfair to assume Doncic's tripple double numbers won't spike upwards cause u know, he's fucking Luka Doncic"
&gt; **Technical fouls** - Dwight Howard and Luka Doncic (**16**)  No. Not ... yet.
"Yeah man, Luka is always doing more damage than Jokic. That's why Jokic is having arguably the best offensive season for any big man in the history of the NBA, and is a lock to win MVP.   They're both really good, but saying it's gonna be a wash because of Doncic is not really true."
1. Russel Westbrook - 182 2. Oscar Robertson - 181 3. Magic Johnson - 138 4. Jason Kidd - 107 5. LeBron James - 99 6. Wilt Chamberlain - 78 7. Larry Bird - 59 8. James Harden - 58 9. Nikola Jokić - 56 10. Fat Lever - 43 11. Luka Doncic - 35  We used to consider Jason Kidd a Triple Double Machine.
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
MVP: Luka Doncic  DPOY: Dorian Finney-Smith  6MOY: Jalen Brunson/Tim Hardaway Jr.  COY: Rick Carlisle  MIP: Jalen Brunson
"Sexton was bumping him in his back, so he turns and swipes down at his hands. Even Sexton said there’s no hard feelings  Damn, I know Luka stans can be annoying, but some people have the largest hate boner for him I swear  https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2021/05/collin-sexton-says-all-good-between-him-and-luka-doncic-after-mavericks-star-takes-aggressive-below-the-belt-swipe-and-gets-ejected.html"
"Im going to assume you don’t realize why Tim Hardaway Jr. needs to come off curls and needs screens in order to get his shot off, so i’ll explain it to you. In basketball there is a thing called dribbling, or ball handling if you will, which allows a player to move their feet freely without travelling. The player in question, Tim Hardaway Jr., is not great at it, and cannot consistently create his own shoot, so he needs good passers like Luka Doncic and screeners in order to get open. Kevin Durant meanwhile, can dribble at a level higher than a guy at the local ymca and thus, is able to get open off the dribble, minimising his reliance on back screens, elevator screens, horns, curls, etc. They are two different players, one can shoot off the dribble and, for that matter, in any other setting, while the other needs plays drawn up in order to get his shot off. There’s levels to this"

"[There was the incident with KAT a month ago,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yM1VusrFO8) [his similar troubles in Europe,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAM0SA5gWTw) several incidents trying to start fights ([1,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5-iOTHkRWc) [2,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or3UEMeA_c4) [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo7qT3u4YPw)). On top of leading the NBA in technicals over a 2 year period, and other incidents I can't remember off the top of my head right now.  Hell man, just search ""luka doncic angry"" or ""heated moments"" and you will find compilations of him fuming. He has a reputation for this. Time and time again, Luka keeps proving to the NBA it's really easy to get under his skin. He needs to fix that shit."
"luka went full 12 year old gamer on him. trying to punch dudes in the balls and then eyeing them down is such a fucking douche move. theres a good reason you never see this happen, and thats why bitch baby doncic got ejected."
Luka “the Danger” Doncic
"Luka ""Draymond Green"" Doncic"
"Lol, that's not the same logic.  I don't think you know what logic means.   If you are a Euro fanboy, you probably shouldn't be commenting on a European player in this context.  Being a Suns fan creates no bias towards/against Luka Doncic and the Mavericks."
Luka Ric Flair Doncic
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
"&gt;oh go suck a dick   Hey now, it’s not polite to repeat what Luka “whiny strawberry” Doncic says to the refs"
[DAL] luka doncic 🤔🤔🤔
https://basketballforever.com/2021/05/07/luka-doncic-admits-he-complains-too-much-as-he-sits-on-15-technicals?amp
You say that but just a couple of years ago LUKA DONCIC was selected #3 overall. After he literally just won the Euroleague and was MVP.   The bias is still very much there.
You have some serious issues if you think Luka fucking Doncic is wearing a hair piece Jesus Christ
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
Funny cause I'd take Cunningham over current Lavin too if that's Jalen's max potential.  Cunningham has that Luka doncic game.
"What else were they supposed to use the pick on? It’s not like a Luka Doncic was available in the draft at their pick.  With hindsight, LaMelo or Halliburton would have been more ready in year 1, but that’s with hindsight. LaMelo shot 37.5% in Australia and looked lost on defense. Halliburton averaged 15 points per game on a 12-20 college team.  No matter what the Warriors did with that pick they were hoping for a guy that would probably be fine as there were no sure fire picks available for them."
And what distinguishes what he did then from what Donovan Mitchell or Luka Doncic or James Harden do now?
That seems like a logical thing for Luka Doncic to say
Sometimes they agree but have to wait until after the draft for it to move into the next season officially (and financially) to get it to work with the salary cap and restrictions  Also a lot of teams try to trade down and get something out of it if they feel they can get their guy lower. IE Luka Doncic
"Zion Williamson, Luka Doncic &amp; LaMelo Ball will be taking turns trading the MVP award for several years to come"
Damn Luka Doncic is next level 🤯
"Yeah that's not really fair though. You can do that with Giannis too, and a lot of Euro players. It's way harder to tell if their game will translate. Will they be Darko Milicic, or Luka Doncic? In that same Jokic draft, Dario Saric and Nurkic were both taken ahead of Jokic. MPJ fell because of injuries but it's not like he was a secret unknown"

"Yes, but had the league indicated “we are trying to start by Christmas” from the start, players would have factored that into their offseason plans/conditioning.

Skip is slowly moving his hate parade to one Luka Doncic
He went to the Luka Doncic and Jaren Jackson Mavericks and then went back to Washington with the number 1 pick in 2032 and Cade Cunningham to win 3 more rings before retiring after 21 seasons. He averaged 1 PPG in 6 of those. Markelle Fultz also became an MVP for the Bucks after they traded Giannis for DPOY Day'ron Sharpe. It was an epic simulation.

[One of the funniest unintended skits that Blake Griffin did in the Mexico game with Luka Doncic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoCHrTh0FQo) Dude is a natural comedian.
"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
"I get why people do this, but we need to do better at not playing into sterotypes. Luka is not a motion player, you wouldn't want him in a motion offense. Obviously ANY team would want the kid - but he's a Pick and roll player with a strong iso game.   &amp;#x200B;  You might want him in older more dumbed down motion based offenses - but the complexity of systems that coaches like Luke are trying to run are not meant to be go with players like Doncic."
"This is not a good comparison. Green is not Luka level talent. NBA slept on Luka because he came from Europe. Just regular ole USA talent &gt; euro talent bias.  You can make an argument for Green over Cunningham, and vice vers, but it's not Ayton over Doncic.  On top of all of this, 1 year in the G League is not comparable to multiple years Luka played in Europe."
"Luka Doncic ""Bang, Bang"" play last year against the Clips in the Bubble."
Luka The don Doncic. Then a tier below would be Jokic and Giannis and Zion.
But you do have to be a Doncic stan to pretend his supporting cast is like the 2005 Cavs by suggesting we “trade everyone who isn’t Luka” lol
"Luka Doncic, Stephen Curry, Steven Adams, Nikola Vucevic, Royce O'Neale"
"See: Doncic, Luka"
"I never said doncic is carrying bums but do you even watch Mavs games? THJ is by far the worst defender to get any significant minutes on the team. He's not even the fourth best player on the team. Luka, KP, Brunson and DFS are all ahead of him.  Speaking of DFS, he's an average 3-D role player who would come off the bench for any contender. And he's the second best player on this Mavs team (KP has been injured and/or inconsistent defensively). Most of the team is undrafted players and reclamation projects like WCS and they're in the 5th seed in the West."
Don't have to be a doncic stan to know that this roster outside of Luka and KP is extremely mediocre. If DFS is your second best player then your roster is pretty poor.
"&gt; outside of hardcore Luka stans   I was sorting by new and saw a post the other day asking if the nba was ""embarrassed "" that two white players in doncic and jokic are the best 2 players in the league.    Like yo, nba players and usa nba fans fucking love those 2 guys? What is embarrassing about basketball becoming a global sport and attracting global talent?"
"&gt;Any tall PG with high intelligence, great passing, shooting range, flair, great handles and great rebounding like LaMelo has a chance to be a superstar like Luka. Yeah.  He averages 6 rebounds per game. That's barely more than Ant so I don't see this ""Great"" rebounding. Russ is a great rebounder,Harden is a great rebounder etc. LaMelo is average maybe above average for his position due to his height.  You also can't compare him to Doncic with his shooting because LaMelo is only a catch and shoot specialist meanwhile Doncic only had 43% of 3 point shots assisted in his rookie year. Doncic produced a great rookie season playing mostly by himself meanwhile LaMelo has had good teammates in Hayward,Rozier and Graham to make things easier for him and to take ball handling responsibilities when needed.   I never said he wouldn't be a good player or isn't a good player now but the intangibles that Luka has are what showed his top 5 potential. He lead his team from day 1. That's why its so hard to say for LaMelo or Ant or any rookie that they are a top 5 potential because you see it from day 1."

"I'm convinced a Rivers team would have folded after getting dicked on by Luka Doncic in that manner, no way they come back from that one. Doc wouldn't have had the balls to DNP Pat Bev &amp; Zubac"
"At least Lue is willing to try something different, he went from playing Beverley big minutes to essentially DNPing his ass after Beverley got straight-up bullied by Luka Doncic  He started trying different lineups as well to counter Luka Doncic hunting for Zubac in the pick&amp;roll, which culminated in the no-center-all-wings lineup they currently run"
Luka Doncic much harder to guard than Donovan Mitchell
"Idk. Doncic is good, great even, but he wines all the time and seems to bring the drama. Also, he’s built like the Pillsbury dough boy. The later years might not be too kind to Luka. When it’s all said and done...Trae might be better in the long run."
"IMO, Doncic should have been the easy #1 pick (even without hindsight)  If one believes that Euroleague &gt; NCAA, and since Luka was the best player in the Euroleague the year before he drafted, he should have been clear #1 pick"
Ya know what. Since I’m came in calm on my last take maybe I’ll come in a little hot. I think Trae Young and Luka Doncic are a LOT closer than people think.
"Same, but for Luka Doncic"
"Bojan ""Michael ""Luka ""Damian Lillard"" Doncic"" Porter Jr."" Bogdanovic"
"Damn, due to attrition, Trae Young is really going to win a Finals MVP before Luka Doncic and Marvin Bagley."
Trae Young &gt; Luka Doncic
"If Cuban wants to squash this Luka nonsense and wants a legit President of Basketball Operations that everyone would Fahd serious, would get along with Rick Carlisle and most likely Luka Doncic would be in awe of then cut a blank check for 2-3 years and go get Larry Bird.   Bird is 64 years old, has been out of the hand fur awhile so he might be ready for one last shot and a chance to have an owner that wants to win in Cuban, a great coach and a franchise player might just be something that gets him back in it"
"The Dallas Mavericks have withdrawn their contract offer to Luka Doncic, citing irreconcilable differences"
"PG: Doncic, SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, SF: Bojan Bogdanovic, PF: Vucevic, C: Jokic  Bench: Dragic, Pokusevski, Mirotic, Zubac, Bjelica, Boban, Dario Saric, Jusuf Nurkic, Luka Samanic...  2 All NBA players and 3 stars (Vucevic was an all star) in starting lineup. Crazy stacked bench.   This team would crush everyone except USA, and it would be on even levels with USA considering they have MVP and a Luka ""2 All NBA First teams in first 3 seasons in the league"" Doncic."
"This is a bandaid headline, Townsend is doing the work of making it seem as if other reporters are making shit up. Obviously the negative articles didn't source doncic because doncic isn't dumb enough to give headline making statements, the source for his dissatisfaction was likely some nameless office personnel who witnessed Luka being angry firsthand."
"My assumption is that Spears reached out to his agent, Billy Duffy, and Duffy told him something like:  Duffy: ""Luka is disappointed to see Donnie go. He and Donnie had a good relationship.  ""Spears: ""Got it. How are contract talks going?""  Duffy: ""Haha what talks?"" (In reference to the full 5 years Rose Rule Max being a foregone conclusion given Luka's recent public comments where he responded ""Haha I think you know the answer"" when asked if he would sign this past week.  Spears today on on The Jump: ""Luka Doncic was close with Donnie Nelson and is not happy they fired him at all. And I am hearing they are having 0 talks about that new contract."""
"“I'm told that reports of Luka Doncic being upset about Donnie Nelson's parting with the Mavericks aren't based on conversations anyone's had with Doncic because he hasn't shared such feelings.”   That doesn’t sound like the confirmation is coming from Luka, it sounds like it’s from other ppl..  Could be wrong, it just seems odd to report this without getting direct confirmation from Luka.  Anyway Luka is not turning down $200M No need to worry"
from Brad Townsend (Local Mavs Reporter and certainly one of the most reliable)   [I'm told that reports of Luka Doncic being upset about Donnie Nelson's parting with the Mavericks aren't based on conversations anyone's had with Doncic because he hasn't shared such feelings.](https://twitter.com/townbrad/status/1405289492236275712?s=20)
He said Luka was a 2nd round pick  It’s one thing not to be high on Luka but this died acted like Doncic was the 2nd coming of Corey Brewer
"The idea that Marc Spears knows anything about Luka Doncic is kind of laughable. Donnie was the dude who was basically placing the blame at Luka's feet on the radio less than a week ago. With the exception of drafting Luka, Donnie's done jack shit for the team since the championship. A fresh start is necessary."
"Idk how to feel about this tbh. Bogdan Bogdanovic and Luka Doncic will play and they have had (well Bogdan’s season is still not over) a similar amount of games played like Jokic. I’m can’t blame him, he brought us happiness by being the MVP."
Luka puts the Don in Doncic
"&gt;Hawks would've been better off if they'd just kept Doncic.  Would we? One of the main reasons why were 2-2 in this series is because of traes playmaking and his quickness. Luka doesn't have the same level of playmaking and quickness Trae has. Not only that, but Luka hasn't beaten the 6ers this year at all while we're one game under .500 against them. Not to take away from how great a player Luka is though, just putting it in the proper frame"
Imagine being the GM that won a championship and also being a gm that was smart enough to trade up to get Luka Doncic and still get fired 3 years later.
"&gt; To be honest, the article tried extra hard to paint one heated interaction between Doncic and Harlabob as some telltale sign of some deep seated conflict. Doncic could be perfectly happy with the guy.   I remember Lakers optimists saying the same thing after Shaq screamed ""pay me, motherfucker!"" at Dr. Buss. It was just an isolated incident, it didn't really mean anything, etc.   9 months later Shaq was in Miami.   I don't think DAL is trading Luka anywhere, but sometimes there's fire where there's smoke."
"cool tidbit:    Bridges is one of the league’s most versatile defenders, with the physical tools to match up with players at all four perimeter positions.

There were no off nights for him this season. [His top five most frequent assignments](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628969/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) were Brandon Ingram, Damian Lillard, Jamal Murray, Luka Doncic, and Stephen Curry. "

If Giannis had the ability to dictate the game like Lebron, Doncic, Harden, Luka with IQ.. he would.  Giannis is a generational athlete with a combo of size/power we’ve never seen. He is not a smart basketball player though. Its laughable to think he’s on the court scanning plays and analysing stuff like other players would.  He takes 15 seconds to shoot a free throw lmao"
tell that to ben simmons and luka doncic and they're point guards LOL
"He was never even close to that level or on that trajectory. Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards are the guys most likely to dominate the league like Lebron imo.   Guys like Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins, and Giannis are not that."
"I’m also placing Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic over him. Kyrie Irving has a case too, dude kills it on his iso plays. Embiid and Jokic as well... not sure if Giannis is even top 10 worthy."

Counterpoint: clips on Donovan Mitchell and Luka doncic. It worked well
Laughs in Luka Doncic. Both those players in one body.
KD growing up to be like his hero Luka Doncic
"As a big fan of basketball.....it's amazing to see KD return from such a horrific injury and still maintain, or even IMPROVE the hall of fame level of play we all know, it's nuts.   On another note, when they put up the list of 45pt playoff triple doubles during the game, crazy to see Luka Doncic name up there as KD had one of the best performances of his career, dude definitely is one of the next KD/superstar players."
"For some body types its hard to put muscle and cut fat to look shredded. But if Jokic wanted he could've a body like them too. However, it would not help Jokic as a baller. Jokic putting a lot of minutes and he's too active on the offense. He's playing one of the most energy consuming style among the bigs. He even brings the ball full court sometimes. In general Jokic does not have strength issue, he finishes in the low post area against the toughest competition anyway. So more muscle would only slow him down for offense and defense.  I think it might be better to have some fat to have that durability and longevity. Both Luka and Jokic do not look shredded but they have elite strength. For Doncic you can claim he has an elite deceleration like Harden as well. Porzingis gained a lot of muscles and built his upper body/shoulders pretty wide during Knicks offseason. And his first big knee injury happened that season. KP looks more like an athlete if you just judge by the looks. In reality, Jokic has the body to play allseason."
"Soo. Steph Curry who couldn't even make it into the playoffs. Lebron James who barely played and is hobbled and Julius Randle who may be good but no love for Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell?  Luka Doncic who can't get out of the first rd?  I whole-heartedly disagree with HALF of this list.  Oh yeah, did I miss Kevin Durant????!!!  Who picks Playoff P over KD?  No Booker?"
I mean there’s no chess required when your GM is a blundering idiot and just straight up passes on Luka Doncic.
Those are Luka Doncic numbers
"Here's a good chunk of them hanging out during the bubble.   &gt;[Among the group was his Trail Blazers teammate Mario Hezonja, Goran Dragic of Miami Heat, Nikola Jokic and Vlatko Cancar of the Denver Nuggets, Luka Doncic and Boban Marjanovic of the Dallas Mavericks, Nikola Vucevic of the Orlando Magic and Ivica Zubac of the Los Angeles Clippers.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)  &gt;[Nurkic is from Bosnia, Zubac and Hezonja are from Croatia, Vucevic resides from Montenegro, Dragic, Doncic, Cancar all hail from Slovenia, and Marjanovic and Jokic grew up in Serbia.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)"
"Trae is more effective in this series against the sixers than luka would have been.

So no"
Luka Doncic is victim of the Mavs FO falling for the fraudulent hype job that is Kristaps Porzingis.
Donovan Mitchell and Luka Doncic: First time?
"Doncic was eligible at forward. So Dame, Luka, Doncic, Giannis and Jokic is entirely possible."
"Giannis got 250/5, so its not a reach 5yrs from now it will go there. Luka Doncic, slovenian richest person ever"
"Ginoboli?  Also,  obviously Luka doncic who was demolishing europe when he was 18."
"They do different things. Yes, they are offensive engines, but Luka is more of a penetrator, using his step-back to open driving lanes and using his size and deceleration to finish, or kick out. Trae plays more outside, deliberately shooting from well outside of the arc and gunning for layups.  In terms of comparisons, I don't know, I don't watch either enough. I know that Trae's height is a significant disadvantage - it limits his passing lanes, ability to finish and defense. There's a reason that Iverson and CP3 are, to my knowledge, the only top 50 players of all time under 6'2. Of course, height isn't a pure disadvantage and Trae can do things Luka can't.  Honestly, the metrics that I scouted are pretty even, which surprised me. I think the gap is smaller than people say and that Trae doesn't get enough credit. With that said, many will argue Luka outplayed Kawhi, where I don't know people would say Trae was quite as incredible, and NBA nerds that I trust like Ben Taylor do believe Luka is noticeably, but not overwhelmingly, better. I would consume some of their content - Thinking Basketball does have a 5 thoughts where he explains why he felt Trae was not quite an All-Star at the beginning of last year, and a video where he claims Doncic was the best 20 year to ever play in the NBA."
All respect to Doncic but Trae throws some crazy dimes Luka wouldn't even look for tbh like they're both insane players but Trae has the edge with passing for sure
Collins and Capela are amazing at pick and roll and lobs. The only guy the mavs have that can Roll well is Powel who pre Achilles had insane chemistry with Doncic with their pick and roll being among the most efficient plays in the league. It makes no sense to think that they wouldnt be great with Luka who's pick and roll stats and creation are top 2-3 in the league. Porzingis literally refuses to roll and couldnt hit his open 3s when he poped in these playoffs. Also Capela both Capela and Collins are far better in defense (Capela mostly) and rebounding that current porzingis. You think KP would be playing magicaly close to them on that end next to Trae ? How?  Also Luka hasnt played with someone who can playmake and create like bogdanovic yet in the nba so why guess that they wouldnt fit ? The only time he played with Bogdanoic style players was with  Dragic and Llull before the nba and in the national team and fit perfectly

They are clearly two different things proven by Luka doncic
"&gt;assuming the story is true that is.  Did you even read the story lol? It says there are **internal fears** Luka may not stay long term if they don't solve their roster and FO issues.   &gt;Doncic has a healthy relationship with the Mavericks organization at large. League sources say he angled to be drafted by the team in 2018, and he has been particularly complimentary of his relationship with Nowitzki, whose final season coincided with Doncic’s first. Those feelings could change if the team’s postseason struggles continue, as the Mavericks haven’t advanced past the first round since their 2011 championship run. It’s not that Doncic’s situation with the team is at a critical inflection point right now. Multiple team sources simply fear that it’s heading that direction.  Yall really should take the time to educate yourself and actually read articles before posting stuff like this."
Headlines all of last week  Mavericks' Kristaps Porzingis reportedly 'frustrated' with role in Dallas; questions emerge about 'chemistry' with Luka Doncic
You bitchasses in the media are bought and paid by big franchises. You think Luka's going anywhere? Nooooope.   NYK and LAL gonna suck ass next year too if their plan is to spike the media to loosen Luka from the Mavs. This anti Mavs shit is bought and paid for by people who want Luka fucking Doncic
Beverly gets fucking roasted by Doncic due to size.   George has not been great defensively in the playoffs  Kawhi only defended him a few possessions.  I agree Luka &gt; trae but wrong argument
"Luka ""Empty Stats"" Doncic"
Even the Mavs take is stupid lol. Mavs didn't just roll to the 5th seed in the west by Luka carrying the entire time.  Mavs still took the Clips to 7 and Doncic didn't score all the teams damn points.
Luka also is angry that Voulgaris has left close games early in the 4th quarter. Doncic feels like he is quitting on the team when that happens.
"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic , Jaren Jackson Jr, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Brides, Michael Porter Jr   Which one of these players is he better than?"
"Pure speculation. Some reporters are saying Carlisle gave too much role/freedom to Luka so he's responsible for KP situation. Others speculate Luka does not like Carlisle. Doesn't make sense...  Carlisle clearly gave Luka greater freedom and you can even claim that he shred the role of KP too much in favor of Luka. Its really hard to say Luka to be upset with Carlisle. One timeout call should not be enough to create speculation.  But anyway, Mavs-Doncic getting into those speculations might be good thing. Maybe the league/refs would start to give more respect to Luka as he's talked more."
"Durant doesn't need this series. We already know he's the second best player of the past decade, first-ballot Hall of Famer, and a lock for top 50 all time. I know it's trendy to hate on him, but he's not Donovan Mitchell or Luka Doncic - he doesn't need to prove anything anymore."
Kevin O’Leary: you give me all of your first round picks in perpetuity in exchange for 25% of regular season starts by Luka Doncic

&gt;Young and Harden are both still alive in these playoffs  The start of the tweet came off as hilarious. Was half expecting the next part to say meanwhile guys like Luka Doncic have passed away in the last round.
This team would be unstoppable. Jokic and Doncic would be primary ball handlers and Tatum would benefit a lot from the attention those two would draw. His defense would probably be even better since he doesn’t need to handle the ball all game. You’re either getting eaten alive inside by Jokic (who you wouldn’t be able to double) or have threes rained on you by Luka and Tatum. No chance this team wouldn’t make the Finals if they were healthy.

IT IS HAPPENING  LUKA DONCIC HAS SOLD HIS SOUL IN ORDER TO SIGN WITH THE LAKERS
"Here's what Mark Cuban should do if Luka doesn't like something: Change it. Doesn't like the ""shadow GM?"" Goodbye, Mr. Shadow. Doesn't like the teams colors? Pink and Orange it is, Mr. Doncic. Wants Porzingis traded for an older office chair? What type of chair, sir?   Doncic is a generational talent. Keep in mind we're going to experience another July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's and Valentine's Day before Luka has another birthday. He's 22. LeBron is going into his 19th season, for reference. He's putting up nearly a 30+ point triple double in 13 career playoff games vs a team literally designed to stop a very tall man who plays point but can also drive at will. And this isn't one of those scenarios where you watch a player and think ""They'll never top that!"" Between Shaq-esque FT shooting, wild threes at times, terrible passes and just wearing down due to getting no help, no objective person could have watches the Clips/Mavs and wondered what the ceiling is for Doncic. As he matures and gets more help, could he average 45/15/10 in a deep playoff run?"
"That stuff about Carlisle wasn’t necessarily new reporting. It seemed pretty similar to [this article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) from 2019.   Basically, both suggest that while there was tension over Carlisles’s micromanaging early, his relationship with Luka since then is more like how it was Kidd than it was with Rondo."
1st G - Stephen Curry G - Damian Lillard  F - Luka Doncic F - Giannis  C - Nikola Jokic  2nd G - Chris Paul G - Jimmy Butler F - Kawhi Leonard  F - Julius Randle C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kyrie Irving G - Paul George  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Lebron James C - Rudy Gobert
"Lol.  This is what he said:  ""Here's a guy (Doncic) that thinks that he can win every possession of every game,"" said Nelson. ""His numbers are unique. I think part of his maturity is again knowing how to balance all those kill shots with involving teammates at the right time.""   Maybe Luka would involve his teammates if they could keep the ball in their hands and not lose it after 2 dribbles(KP,DFS,Kleber etc)  Instead of blaming the guy who made the series close in the 1st place maybe say that Mavs losing in the 1st round its your fault cause you built Luka a shit team.  Also im sure that if Luka was asked who was to blame for this Mavs lose he would say that its him because he always take the blame and is not an arrogant pig like Donnie."
"I would like to propose a trade ... We, the people of the Sacramento Kings, would like to, again, trade for Luka Doncic. In exchange, we’ll give you some of our drivers."
This is what happens when you mortgage your franchise of its assets and draft luka doncic
Yeah there was that post on here last week of Luka and Porzingis running PnR and Doncic would settle for contest mid ranges that missed even tho porzingis would be wide open
"If what was said about Luka last year is true, I can see it becoming increasingly more difficult for the Mavs to land other big stars.  KP not liking to play with Luka, Barnes not liking playing with Luka, DSJ not having anything nice to say.  Now Luka having problems with the FO in his 3rd year on the team even tho he’s only been on the team for 3 seasons and seen 2 playoff pushes.  It’s seeming more and more that Luka is arrogant and rather self absorbed.  AD 6 years with NOLA before he even considered leaving and had way less success with playoffs then Doncic early on.  Yet when AD forced his way out, everyone crucified him, but I bet if Luka did it with the Mavs you would blame them instead of Luka."
The Seattle Supersonics select Luka Doncic in the 2025 expansion draft
"&gt;	A high-level power broker within the league says the Mavericks recognize that there’s urgency to build a contending team around Doncic after losing in the first round in each of the past two seasons. The clock is ticking.  “The clock is ticking” and will continue to tick through Luka’s RFA rights and his next contract (5 years). There’s no serious urgency, they could lose in the first round for the next 4 years, win a title and there’d be little difference.   MAYBE there’s urgency to get some guys under the cap while Luka is still on a rookie scale contract, but there’s no urgency to win within the next 2 years. Because of rookie rights, Luka is effectively a Mav for at least the next 4 years."
"&gt;	Voulgaris, sitting with an open laptop in his typical courtside seat across from the Mavericks’ bench, motioned downward with his hands, which Doncic specifically interpreted as Voulgaris telling him to calm down, multiple team and league sources tell The Athletic.

Is this supposed to paint Voulgaris in a bad light? Cause it just makes Luka look like the asshole"
Luka Doncic just  pushed the Clippers to 7 lmao
"They have the Luka supermax to make things work. And they will pretty much cement Cuban perception as a owner. If he's not able to make them contenders the narrative will be ""look how much time the mavs had Dirk + Doncic and how little they could get out of it"". They will have to do some drastic change: either FO/coaching/roster to try to bump the team to the next step. The article seems like they don't have a good FO structure so let's see. Doncic is theirs for the supermax and he's a hell of a building block. The long they wait, the harder it'll be to attract a complementary star though."
"&gt;Doncic has a healthy relationship with the Mavericks organization at large. League sources say he angled to be drafted by the team in 2018, and he has been particularly complimentary of his relationship with Nowitzki, whose final season coincided with Doncic’s first. Those feelings could change if the team’s postseason struggles continue, as the Mavericks haven’t advanced past the first round since their 2011 championship run. It’s not that Doncic’s situation with the team is at a critical inflection point right now. Multiple team sources simply fear that it’s heading that direction.  Basically Dallas needs to get its shit together and give Luka help or it could become an issue sooner rather than later."
Dude is obsessed with Doncic. Kawhi outplayed him in the same series and he still ranks Luka 3 spots ahead of him
"In early February, during the second quarter of a home game against the Golden State Warriors, Luka Doncic carelessly turned over the ball and received feedback from a Dallas Mavericks employee he didn’t care for: Haralabos Voulgaris, a well-known sports gambler hired by team owner Mark Cuban in 2018.  Voulgaris, sitting with an open laptop in his typical courtside seat across from the Mavericks’ bench, motioned downward with his hands, which Doncic specifically interpreted as Voulgaris telling him to calm down, multiple team and league sources tell The Athletic. Doncic snapped back, telling Voulgaris, according to one source’s recollection, “Don’t fucking tell me to calm down.” The same sources say Voulgaris later professed that his motion wasn’t solely directed at Doncic, but regardless of intent, it only worsened an already inflamed relationship between the two.  Doncic, multiple league sources say, intends to sign the supermax extension — which he will be eligible for once named to this season’s All-NBA team — with Dallas, worth more than $200 million over five seasons after his rookie contract expires next summer. “I think you know the answer,” he said, smiling, when asked whether he would at last week’s exit interview. But a high-level power broker within the league says the Mavericks recognize that there’s urgency to build a contending team around Doncic after losing in the first round in each of the past two seasons. The clock is ticking.  Internally, there are concerns the front office’s dysfunction has hurt its ability to do so — and that poor relationships Doncic has with key members of the franchise, including Voulgaris, could impact his current desire to remain in Dallas long-term. The team’s most recent postseason defeat against the LA Clippers served as a direct indictment on the roster constructed around him. Can Mavericks management remedy that in time? Or, as some team sources fear, will they pay the price for the dysfunctional dynamics that exist in some corners of the organization?"
"Luka was not an unknown. He was the best European prospect ever and had a long lost of accolades in one of the toughest leagues outside of the nba. His accomplishments were well documented.  And Ayton wasn't even close to being consensus number one. About half the big boards out there pegged doncic as the best prospect in the draft, and the other half all said it was close. Not to mention Doncic's former coach was also the suns coach at the time so McD wouldn't have that tough of a time drafting him if he thought he was the best prospect."
"Top 5 r/nba Golden Boys:  0. \*Chet Holmgren (when this guy gets drafted, no one will come close to the sheer obnoxiousness of future Chet stans **GUARANTEE**. Save this comment and gild me when I'm right @ 2023)  1. Luka Doncic  2. Nikola Jokic  3. Steph Curry  4. Alex Caruso  5. Boban"
On reddit it is 100% Luka Doncic fans imo. I think it is a lot of euro's who think he is a god among men.
Luka Doncic fans
"Is Jokic really top 3? I know he won MVP, but is he really better than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Lebron James, Joel Embiid, and Luka Doncic? I know I will get downvoted to hell for calling this out, but come on."
Luka “wow he’s the best player ever-white step dads” Doncic
Any team in the NBA would struggle against Luka Doncic
We swept the Jazz in the regular season. Clippers struggled against only Luka Doncic. I think we also swept the 76ers

"Giannis Antetokoumpo- Winner, dominant force of nature, reminds me of David Robinson and Shaq with his ability to absolutely affect the game just with his physicality. Is on a winning team.  Luka Doncic- Young Phenom, is skilled, shifty handles and ball fakes, can make circus shots or no look passes. Clutch, and is on a up and coming team that is looking for the next price to elevate them.  Trae Young- absolutely electric player, logo threes, ankle breakers, or lobs to his big men, shifty handles and crisp passing. Is on a young team that overachieved a little bit, but should be able to continue their level of play, and will only get better.   Zion Williamson- Air Gumbo, looks like shaq bud is 6’6, can body anybody out of the way, is a insane dunker. On a bad team right now, but one that has a lot of talent, and are trying to figure it out to make the playoffs."

"* Luka Doncic * Devin Booker * SGA * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Trae Young * Ja Morant * De'Aaron Fox  Anyone who doesn't put Luka #1 is on crack. SGA's length makes me love him for the defensive aspect of his game more than a few others, even if they're a bit better scorers. It's crazy how Fox is last cuz I think he's also great."
"2025 Luka Doncic, except with better free throw shooting"
"Pretty crazy how many young players are elite passers in the league now.   Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, LaMelo Ball, Ben Simmons, Ja Morant, etc.   Seems like we have been getting a steady influx of players beyond their years for passing/playmaking"
"Name nba players that has no flaws. How many there are? like 3? Kevin Durant (but he has some injury concerns so maybe doesnt fit here?), Lebron James (but he is at the end of his career so maybe doesnt fit either), Luka Doncic (below average 3pts/ft shooter, lots of To...so maybe bot him either?).  You are massively underrating Sabonis. He can defend. Defence isnt only blocked shots. Its steals too (Sabonis had 1.1 per game), its deflections (was high on the list), rebounds (one of the best in the business), he was like leading nba in distance covered on defence meaning he is putting effort there.  Even advanced stats that kinda did nt like Sabonis last year - werent bad whatsoever for his defence (they suffered on offense mostly).  Also he just turned 25, is on great contract and keeps improving massively every year."
"They're solidly behind (with regards to the All-Star game, voted on by fans and then coaches) Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard. They're more in the Donovan Mitchell, Paul George range, which means (with regards to making the Western Conference All-Star Team) they're borderline/fringe."
Luka Doncic 100% before he even entered the NBA. lmao
Ask Luka Doncic
This has probably been said but holy shit bald Luka Doncic would look exactly like Jason Kidd
these playoffs in particular has been an intriguing unveiling of newer stars such as Trae Young (and Hawks teammates) and Luka Doncic and Nuggets guy and it's also seen some chokers and exposed some weaknesses in players / teams
"Kobe is not up there. The problem with people trying to highlight ""underrated athleticism"" is that the greats also possessed that and more. Yes its not about how high you jump, but what does Kobe do that Lebron or MJ couldn't? Kobe is an athletic ""checks every box"" guy but he never excelled in any athletic traits. Lebron and Jordans ability to maneuver their bodies is not just because of vertical or hand size. They mastered the fundamentals just like Kobe. But they were faster, stronger, as or more dexterous, had the coordination, the leaping ability, the agility, the freak of nature aspect. They checked every box and destroyed what people thought was possible. Baseline windmill dunks are proof of Kobe's athleticism? Kobe as an athlete was great, but up there with MJ and Lebron? it's just not true. The thing is the best athletes of all time did the small Luka doncic things and still could outrun, outmuscle, and out agility those ""underrated athlete"" types any day. Kobe doesn't push boundaries, he's the standard."
Luka Doncic of yesterday  Tall PG on a bad team who could score/Pass/rebound   Could back a defender down and had a good jumper. Not really a freak athlete like Wilt or Bill
"no one was saying that fucking lmao. the whole point was that they didnt get luka. And yes, they did fuck up by not taking doncic"
1. Luka doncic will not be on the mavs  2. There will be multiple superteams  3. Their will be a team in Vegas or Seattle  4. Rockets are a dynasty  5. Timberwolves are still trash  6. Heat are the worst team in the nba  7. Anthony Davis is retired due to injuries 8. The Jokic and the nuggets will be a 1st/2nd round exit every year just like dame and blazers right now
"RJ Barrett will be considered a top 15 player in the league  Knicks will make it to the ECF once in this timespan   Celtics blow up their core and rebuild  Kevin Durant leaves the Nets (without winning a ring) when he’s a FA and goes back to OKC, and leads them to a ring  Luka Doncic is the best player in the league (but on a different team)  Like you said, Kawhi retires early  Cade Cunningham is first team All NBA in 2026, leads the pistons to the ECF, but is not the best player in his draft  Jalen Green wins an MVP in 2026 and leads the Rockets to the finals  Kings finally make the playoffs  Lebron retires in 2025, after playing with Bronny. Wins a ring with Bronny.   Trae Young leaves the Hawks to help form a super team out west, with Nikola Jokic  Suns and CP3 win back to back rings this year and next year   Devin Booker wins 1 MVP  Giannis wins another MVP and a ring in 2023  Seattle and Las Vegas get expansion teams, bringing the NBA to 32 teams  James Wiseman is traded next summer and thrives with his new team"
Marvin Bagley is a safer choice at number two than Luka Doncic 😔
"This made me want to look up the leaders in possessions doubled/game:  Top 5 for the regular season:  1: Trae Young - 26.9; 43.9% of possessions; 1.23 team pts/poss   2: Luka Doncic - 26.9; 45.1% of possessions; 1.21 team pts/poss  3: Damian Lillard - 23.8; 40.3% of possessions; 1.23 team pts/poss  4: Chris Paul - 22.9; 42.8% of possessions; 1.19 team pts/poss  5: Bradley Beal - 22.4; 47.1% of possessions; 1.13 team pts/poss  -------------  Side note: It's hilarious how many of these stats I look up and see Trae and Luka 1 and 2 in some order. I know Luka's better and everything, but it's still absurd to have 2 players that aren't only this good but are this good at so many of the same things and defended in similar ways that were drafted the same year and traded for each other."
"As a Laker fan, my biggest fucking pet peeve is listening to our fanbase come up with these outlandish scenarios every offseason where we somehow land a Damian Lillard or a Luka Doncic-type player. Like, guys, it’s not that fucking simple for the love of god. Some of you guys are the most entitled, densest pricks ever, I swear…"
"&gt; Nobody buys mavs tickets or jersey because Mark Cuban is the owner.  Anecdotal, but I went out with a girl who wasnt an NBA fan but loves Mark Cuban and absolutely had ""Go to a Mavericks game"" on her bucket list and when I brought up Luka Doncic she had no idea what I had just said was somebody's name"
You know who I think can average a triple double on 50/40/90? Cade Cunningham and Luka Doncic
"There are lots of Spurs defending the decision but TEAM USA is still lacking a playmaker and We already have Lavine, Booker, Jrue, and Middleton.  Meanwhile, the only half-way elite passer is Draymond Green.   There's also a lack of speed on the defense which Fox would have helped on.  As far as working together, the entire team has barely played together and on the other hand, its not like johnson is going to play right away anyways or whomever would have filled the spot.  Then you add McGee who hasn't played with the team so its like fill a need here and we will just add johnson there.  To make it worse, Luka Doncic for Slovenia and Spain who has Ricky Rubio.  All I have to say, I hope we win Gold."
"Either one of Giannis, Doncic and Jokic is first team all nba.  Let's say that Dallas doesn't start slowly for 30 games because of Covid than they would have a better record than Denver and likely Luka is the MVP  You need context not randomly stating things.  You are ready to die on a hill that Luka can't beat the Clippers after losing the series in 7? That some great take"

Ayton has been a perfect fit in our team but obviously not as good as the generational taleny Doncic but take me back and I do it 10 time out of 10. We aren't where we are now without ayton. simple. And I don't know where we would be with Luka but It doesn't worry me I'm absolutely happy with ayton
"In football I've seen it defined as a player who stays in the top 2-3 in the game for 10+ years, so Messi and Ronaldo for example. Of current NBA players, the current ""generational talents"" by that definition would be LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry.   The players coming through now? I can only really see Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Zion Williamson making it to that level."
"Not really, the comparison is Dirk vs Doncic. MVP finishes are a measure of Dirk vs his competitors that year. Doncic has been in the league for only 3 years, he hasn't had the opportunity to have the longevity of Dirk. I think it makes a lot more sense to just compare Dirk's best season to Doncic now.   Look at when Dirk finished 3rd behind Nash and Shaq in 05, Doncic had a better year than him. That's why a resume accomplishment is a bad argument, Luka finished 6th in MVP voting this past season... https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=nowitdi01&amp;p1yrfrom=2005&amp;player_id2=doncilu01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021"
"Well the offensive rating was outstanding in Luka’s 2nd year when it was the highest ranked offence in the league, however it was also the highest ranked offence in the league when Luka was off the court as well. That Mavericks team was just loaded with players that were good on offence.   Last year they lost some of their offensive depth, and their team was the 9th ranked offence.  Luka is a great 1st option/playmaker (one of the best in the league), but IMO someone like Jokic would run most offences more efficiently than Doncic because he shares the ball so much more and causes more overall movement on the court."
"Yeah but to be top 10 all time you need to be an MVP with multiple rings/finals MVPs. (Something Doncic hasn’t accomplished and realistically might never accomplish)   A guy like Tracy McGrady was a perennial 1st team All-NBA when he was 22 years old on the magic averaging 33 points and 7 assists in the playoffs for his 1st two series as the guy (sound familiar?)  He never won a playoff series. That’s what you can’t just compare Luka to top 10 guys, careers don’t always pan out the way they look like they will."
"The offence is fine, as long as KP doesn’t try to create his own shot.  [The defence is the problem ](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense#539498155) because (especially after the most recent surgery) all KP can do is drop, and Luka is bad at drop coverage. On the other hand the big defensive advantage of an oversized PG is the ability to switch/show/..., but KP gets murdered in such a scheme."
"On offence, sure.   [On defence — not so much.](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense#539498155) Naturally he can’t say that in his first presser, but I do hope they’ve realised this by now."
"I'm under the impression that he just really wanted to go back to working with Doncic. This is why I don't understand why people throw out how unlikeable Doncic is lol. From all accounts, literally every one of his teammates except KP, have come out and said this dude is a great teammate.  &gt;“Luka Doncic was a big part of my coaching career and growth, he said. “He did an unbelievable job for Slovenian National Team. He will be a hell of a player in this league. So, good memories of Luka. I wish him nothing but the best. But Deandre is my son right now.”  https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2018/6/27/17506734/kokoskov-says-there-was-no-doubt-phoenix-suns-1-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic"
"I always found it funny that the Suns hired Igor Kokosov to coach Luka if they drafted him, but then they went with the hometown kid in Ayton. IIRC, Igor wasn't their first option or choice, since at the time they were still a little dysfunctional. But adding him to the Mavericks now to help Doncic out seems like a really smart plan. Did Mark Cuban have any say in this? This almost seems too good to be true lol.  Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but I remember majority of the r/NBA years ago was on the Luka Doncic hype train."
"Scoring being so common and easy at takes takes some of the suspense out. I keep thinking of how Luka Doncic said it’s easier to score here than in Europe. With the gap in talent and ability, it’s nuts."
Luka doncic
"Its not about the WBNA, its just the way the players act.   They act like they are much better and deserve the same amount of recognition and praise as nba players. Luka Doncic once reached out to the WNBA's ROTY, but they got mad at him for some reason for just saying ""Good Job""."
"Yeah, his Slovenian teammate, JJ Barea   https://www.talkbasket.net/95771-dallas-mavericks-j-j-barea-loves-luka-doncic-as-leader"
Luka Doncic is the Giannis of the NBA? I can see that
I’d get the Luka doncic one or the legends one. Looks cool
"It is Luka. People are saying Kd Because of the shooting which was a huge aspect of Bird’s game no doubt. But The playmaking, rebounding, playing at his own pace, not the most athletic but deceptive quickness and maximizes the talent around him. In terms of complete play style Doncic is the most simalar to Bird. He may not have Bird’s efficient shooting splits but just watching it’s really close."

Remember when NBA players laughed about soft Europeans? Lol.   Luka Doncic: it's fucking easy to score in the NBA!
"You don't understand. Steve Kerr was a young heart. She opposes a present flash. She didn't repair Soviet Russia's eye as her current individual took off a dullness and went a dick kick close to joining the Horses for worst WNBA trainwreck of now. This is the Tame East. And hearing these women win on a domestic periapsis because they can write hard no-calls is somewhat hypothetically the same as what I say of a woman who stays close and discourages some big adult feeling down and hearing the nonsequitur. The disorganization is so hard Adelman didn't have to hear nothing. It's so hard Luka Doncic dismissed it an outrage that the players don't have to be untamed to lock up their ""mediocrebenchwarmers."" It's so hard they don't have a mediocre player privacy before so they can't zoom out on the least insignificant whole of the work: which didn't have the silence. Those fatherprudes aren't defendants, they're peacekeepers."
"Doncic is the only one out of those players that are generational as of now imo. People overuse the term. Steph, KD, Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Harden, Kawhi. Who else in terms of generational?"

"hey, he wasn't that bad.  He won Rookie of the month in December, which is quite impressive, given that he was in Trae Young/Luka Doncic draft class. He averaged 17 PPG that month, and that was on a genuinely awful 17 win Knicks team whose leading scorer was Tim Hardaway Jr's 19 PPG on 38% FG%"
"Interesting. It all depends on what direction Sixers want to go in.  I've been thinking about an adjacent idea, whereby Sixers go a Lowry+Embiid+lots of depth way and can bring back Green, Korkmaz, etc. You might not like it though from a Raps POW.  * Sixers get Lowry S&amp;T, Hood, Redick S&amp;T (only 1st year guaranteed, goes back to NE where he wants to be, driving distance from his family) * Mavs get Simmons, Harris * Raps get KP, JRich (expiring), indeterminate amount of draft compensation from Philly  This does the following:  * Sixers get a deep team, can use the MLE, might even avoid the tax by a whisker, and can easily completely re-do the team in 2 years time. It's a more conventional team, where Embiid is maximised, and only two (Embiid&amp;Lowry) have to stay healthy for a run to work. * Mavs take on lots of money, but get off of KP [whose defence doesn't fit with Luka](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense) \-- Luka is bad at drop (getting over screens, as is almost everyone else on the Mavs) and KP is limited to drop (and zone) alone -- in favour of a switch/show/Box-and-Ben D * Raps do Lowry a solid. KP is the equivalent of training wheels for whomever you get at 4 (probably Suggs, right?) because his spacing does wonders -- no defender is leaving him along 30ft from the basket. A FVV/Suggs/OG/Siakam perimeter also works well with him defensively, especially under Nurse. These are the guys who can get over screens and enable KP to be a valuable defensive piece. KP also expires before the 4th pick needs to get paid, and barring injury his value would rise in the more equitable Raptors' system."
Luka doncic?
Luka Doncic I think he’s basically the mavs gm
"&gt;  The best young guys in the league; Giannis, Luka, Doncic, Booker, are all guys who weren't drafted high but had to earn everything they have in the league.  You know both luka and doncic were drafted 3rd overall?"
"Hope that happens soon. And that someone believes in him a whole lot.  He’s actually valuable on offence - despite the middling 3p%, he’s a great spacer by virtue of the defender staying on him 28ft from the basket.  Defensively he’s regressed, but the fit with the rest of the roster on D is the real problem. He can only play in drop now, but following the most recent surgery he certainly needs the perimeter defender to have fought over the screen — something that few of Mavs players can do. Luka in particular is very poorly suited to drop, and his defensive impact is maximised in a switch/show-heavy scheme — one that KP can’t work in. [Tape and numbers both agree on that.](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense#539498155)  If Raptors S&amp;T Lowry somewhere, KP would be a fantastic fit — FVV, Suggs (seems a likely 4th pick), OG, Siakam and KP should work pretty well. KP’s spacing is like training wheels for Suggs’ first bicycle ride in the NBA, and the perimeter guys are of a type and caliber where KP could have a far better defensive impact than he’s had on the Mavs."
"big men have have always gone high in the draft, so I would not extrapolate too much from that, just look at the 2018 draft where both Ayton &amp; Bagley went ahead of Luka Doncic.  I do think we're seeing a new era of more skilled bigs, which makes sense as the game continues to evolve into a more 5 out style game with tons of emphasis on shooting &amp; creation.  But bigs with the Jokic/Embiid/KAT skillset are super, duper rare and will continue to be just because there's fewer giants in the world than there are guard/wing body-types.  Think about who the 10th best wing (anyone 6'5""-6'8"") is the the NBA vs. the 10th best big-man, someone like Jaylen Brown/Jimmy Butler (this is off the top of my head, don't nit-pick too much) has so much more impact than the 10th best big (someone like Clint Capela or Sabonis), and if you looked went further the supply of wings stays deep &amp; the pool of bigs dries up quickly."
Holy Slovenia rise bc of one Luka Doncic
"I'd say you're about right with Trout = LeBron, I'd say Ohtani is more like Giannis tbh. Explosive and exciting to watch, and great on both sides of the ball  (though this is insanely more impressive in baseball than in basketball)  Tatis Jr. is like Luka Doncic in terms of skill for his age, but in terms of how exciting he is I'd say more like Trae Young or maybe Zion? As fun as Ohtani has been to watch this season, I think Tatis has just as much chance to be the face of baseball.   Also to give you a Kawhi comparison I'd say someone like Mookie Betts is more accurate."
&gt;Every other teams best player is worse than the USA’s worst player….  Yeah. I'll definitely take Kevin Love over Luka Doncic. 😂😂😂😂 LMAO

"Tier 1: Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard  Tier 2: Giannis Antetokoumpo, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis  Tier 3: Damian Lillard, Chris Paul"
"Luka ""For sure"" Doncic.  Joel ""Like I said"" Embiid.  Devin ""Preparation meets opportunity"" Booker."
Someone like Luka Doncic for example. If he wouldve been available at their pick in the 2018 draft then who knows how things shake out.
"Best player in Jazz history, Luka Doncic"
Givony and Vecenie are 2 of the biggest draft experts and they both had Ayton first pre Draft Lottery  https://theathletic.com/237505/2018/02/12/2018-nba-mock-draft-is-deandre-ayton-the-best-player-to-build-around/  https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/22726756/2018-nba-mock-draft-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-trae-young-more    It was definitely a debate but I think the majority saw Ayton as #1 even before the Suns got the #1 pick
"Mavs would be decent too, gets them another shot creator outside of Doncic. But also he's kinda old and idk if he fits their timeline around Luka."
Orlando officially moves above Dallas in the Luka doncic big board   (Luka will be forced to signed this supermax. Real FA starts after)
Is that the name of the Luka Doncic and Luke Kornet fusion
Luka Doncic and any four players.   Folks don't realize how dominant Luka was in Euroleague play and dude was 16.
"Not sure what you’re trying to say here. I don’t know the first decade well enough to disagree on, and I agree on the Russell/ Celtics domination era, but you lose me after that The 70s were the wilderness years, it started well with Bradley &amp; Clyde Knicks, but Cocaine really hurt the league later.  The 80s is Magic &amp; Bird &amp; massive growth, but the 1981 “clarification” of zone defense ushered in the era of isolation (insane illegal defense calls).  The 90s is Jordan/Pippen Bulls domination &amp; clarity on how isolation was ruining the game.  2000-2010 is the return of fluid basketball &amp; the beginning of the 3-pt era.   2010-2020 is LeBron domination &amp; the 3-pt revolution hitting it’s stride, in large part behind Steph Curry.  This is shaping up to be a golden age as superstars are appearing all over the place. Here’s hoping Trae Young, Zion Williamson, Jamal Murray,Luka Doncic, Ja Morant, &amp; all the rest stay healthy because the NBA has never been more fun to watch than it is right now."
That’s like saying a 4 year college player doesn’t deserve to win ROY over one&amp;done.  Or that( hypothetically!!) Luka Doncic shouldn’t win ROY over Morant because EuroLeague is infinitely stronger than whatever conference Murray State was in.
Luka and Jokic are where Giannis was in 2019. It's cool to like them now. The negativity will spike when they become real threats to the American NBA elite.  Then all you'll hear will be how Doncic foulbaits and hunts for rebounds; how Jokic is a Center with no defensive chops and zero athleticism. Their shortcomings will be accentuated to define them.
  [Luka](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/luka-doncic-2021-playoff-stats)   [Book](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/devin-booker-playoff-stats)   Luka has a smaller n in this scenario but any way you slice the data he’s a better scorer and a far better offensive player in general. Don’t get delusional
"&gt;Like seriously, is It a European thing or just people chatting shit for attention  Luka Doncic would like a word"
"I could definitely see a headline ""Should Giannis join Luka Doncic in Dallas?"" 😂"
"We know exactly how Larry Bird would fit into today's NBA -- he's already there.  He's basically Luka Doncic, except better shooting and a real post game.. and just a little better all around.  That's why Luka's ceiling is so friggen high.   Larry Bird was one of the best shooters I've ever seen, period.  And you know, his trash talk was legendary.  He'd tell you exactly what he was going to do to, and tell you that you have no chance to stop it.. then go and do it.  As a Cavs fan who remembers the 80s and early 90s well, there were 2 players that I feared.  MJ and Bird.   It's a damn shame his back gave out on him, but fortunately he had big enough body of work by that time to know exactly where he stood in the pantheon of all time greats.  He's right up there in the top 10."
Carrying a heavier load at ESPN than Luka Doncic for the Mavs
Funny to hear you say this because I was thinking early in the game how many shots were going in and out for the suns while the bucks got some lucky rolls. Not sure if it was confirmation bias because I want the suns to win but I don’t think you’re giving them enough credit. You’ve got a lot of shooters who simply cannot be left open for corner threes and Ayton is looking like the perfect modern center.  Unrelated but it’s amazing how in a draft class with luka fucking doncic 3/5 of the top 5 picks look like perfect fits for their team and I’m still convinced JJJ will be an all star if he stays healthy. (Sorry kings fans)
I think he wants Luka Doncic to jizz in him

Anthony Davis &amp; Luka Doncic? I mean they were both considered that by some before they were drafted &amp;  it looks to have panned out imo
"Everyone after the 2018 draft: Look at Luka Doncic and Trae Young, man.   Mikal Bridges &amp; Deandre Ayton: Our time has come"
I think he would be much more highly regarded had he not been a #1 overall draft pick (over Trae Young and Luka Doncic). He is a very solid player who will never live up to the superstar expectations a top pick has.
Wow people are getting paid to watch luka doncic piss  Some people have all the luck I swear to god
He was the top 1 prospect in the Luka Doncic draft class for a reason before getting injured. Healthy MPJ is a superstar level prospect.
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
"Ding, ding, ding!!!  This is it folks!  I can't tell y'all how many people didn't wanna draft Luka because he was a Euro.    One of my friend's arguments was, ""Who is the best Euro of all time?  Dirk?  I doubt Doncic will be anywhere close to that good."""
Luka Doncic may regress to Luka Don'tcic
"fair enough, exactly, we can disagree about the definition but i love luka. i see doncic as an elite top 5 player, he's basically another james harden. i just don't think he ""broke"" the NBA"
"Luka Doncic is already better than Harden ever was, and their playoffs production prove this."
"Dirk Nowitzki - A clueless man with no wits.  Jason Kidd - A child playing basketball. Or a goat.  Luka Doncic - A Buffalo Bill character who literally dons (wears) chicks (women).  Michael Jordan - A Middle Eastern country trying to fit into a gymnasium.  Dennis Rodman - A man made of rods.  Scottie Pippen - A basketball-playing hobbit.  Hakeem Olajuwon - A loyal Jew named Juan (Ally - Jew - Juan)  Ja Morant - A bunch of ants, like that one Rick &amp; Morty character.  Lonzo Ball - A fancy party attended by princesses.  Charles Oakley - Leaving acorns all over the court."
Luka Doncic  Hes a don
"The Mavs literally list Luka at guard. Rick Carlisle said [""He's my point guard full time""](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2863639-report-mavericks-luka-doncic-rick-carlisle-pairing-questioned-by-some-in-nba). Luka controls the ball nearly all the time and runs the offense. Luka is a PG"
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
PG: Luka Doncic SG: Derrick Rose SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: Lebron James C: Joakim Noah  We’d shoot terribly but I’m taking my chances
"lol I think mine end up being all guards...  Kemba Walker, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Luka Doncic  all-time team has some size: Steve Nash, Kemba Walker, Gerald Wallace, Dirk Nowitzki, Shaquille O'Neal"
Steph Curry  Devin Booker  Luka Doncic  Klay Thompson  Kevin Garnett
What were luka 4th quarter numbers? Despite the loss Doncic? Or 1st quarter phenom Luka?
Hating? You made a whole hate post because you can't stand the fact people are ok with this being a win-win trade lmao. Btw kawhi injury came in the 4th quarter of game 4. Stop talking out your ass. My point still stands. Mitchell averaged 35 5 5 coming off an injury. Nobody said it was better than doncic im asking why don't you keep that same energy and praise him like you do luka?
Julius Randle was picked ahead of Nik Stauskas and Noah Vonleh not Luka Doncic and Trae Young
"Luka Doncic is overrated, he hasn’t done anything in the league yet"
"Thats just stupid man, it shows that you don't watch their games.  Mavericks tried to put ball in the hands of other players while Luka playing off-ball, but things quickly fell apart. Richardson and James Johnson were not good enough to be a real option of secondary ball handler on the team. While in Europe, Doncic played amazing with Dragic being the primary ball handler, and he was 18.  The reality of a situation is that Luka is by far the best ball handler on a team with the current roster, so this is naturally the best way to play if u want to win."
"I understand your side of the argument, i overlooked Giannis entirely. Clearly Lebron won in the playoffs however that is the baseline argument. Lebron played very well and ultimately won the championship. But to say no one was playing his level or better is simply untrue. The lack of a winning team doesn’t discount the skill and ability of an individual player in my opinion.  Luka and Giannis are my front runners for better than Lebron in the bubble season. Luka, had he had a team to carry him on would be the toughest contender for lebron in the western finals, more than the heat were. If you were to skill match all the players to an average amount of production between the Mavericks and the lakers that year and the only stars were Luka and Lebron. Luka would have clearly shown his scoring ability and ball handling to be better than lebrons all around. The only thing that lebron had on luka was court vision and that only stands up because lebron arguably has had the best court vision of any player in the league ever.  Plainly Luka Doncic in the 2019-2020 season was a superior shooter and scorer from the midrange. Roughly equal at finishing around the rim when acounting for percentage and was quicker and faster than lebron james of the dribble. Lebron that year had court vision and iq over luka as well as psychicality."
"Strictly speaking to skill level and productivity/efficiency on the court i believe that Luka Doncic was the best player in the league that year. The team was stopable, but luka was unstoppable. It can be argued that season that Joel embiid and nikola jokic were better. I might add there isn’t much to argue. They both played MVP caliber seasons. The numbers aren’t particularly there state wise but thats why there is a valid argument."

Luka Doncic and being NY. I definitely get being a bit fed up with the later.
"The youth of r/NBA is showing.  Do people think Bird is like a lesser Doncic? Or simply a Taller Doncic?   Do you guys not realize Bird's peak is top 5 of all time? His peak is lower, but closer to MJ/Shaq/LeBron than it is to the next tier of guys generally.  He's basically a mix of Jokic and Luka, with Jokic's effeciency, a higher motor, competitive drive like Kobe, passing skills of CP3, and a superior game IQ than just about anyone playing right now.   He's being severely underrated here. The only thing KD does better is volume scoring, and more effecient mid range shooting by a bit   Bird is better at literally everything else, in his prime. There's no question that at their best, Bird is the superior player.  Do better r/NBA"
Yeah definitely 1. Steph Curry 2. Chris Paul 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damien Lillard 6. Mike Conley 7. Jrue Holiday 8. Trae Young  9. Malcom Brogdon 10.De’aaron Fox
"Luka Doncic, Luka Doncic, Luka Doncic , Luka Doncic, Luka Doncic"
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"
Current Vegas odds if anyone is interested:  2022 Regular Season MVP  Luka Doncic+400  Joel Embiid+700  Kevin Durant+700  Giannis Antetokounmpo+800  Stephen Curry+800  Damian Lillard+1200  Nikola Jokic+1500  LeBron James+1600  Devin Booker+1600  Trae Young+1800  James Harden+2000  Anthony Davis+2500  Jayson Tatum+2500  Russell Westbrook+2500  Donovan Mitchell+3000  Paul George+4000  Kyrie Irving+4000  Zion Williamson+4000
My bet:  Luka Doncic My long shot:  De’Aaron Fox
luka doncic but only come playoff time against my clippers  dude is unconscious its so fucking aggravating
"&gt;The biggest difference was the CP3 addition. Jae was an improvement over Kelly, and Mikal did play a lot better, but CP3 over Rubio is by far the biggest improvement.  They improved from .667 over the second-half of 2020 to .708 in 2021.  The difference is just 3 wins.  You are divvying up a very small improvement now, which was the entire point.  Booker improved.  Ayton improved.  Bridges improved.  Crowder arrived.  Payne played.  All that, plus Paul, led to just +3 wins.  &gt;CP3 is $24 million dollars better than Rubio. He’s an actual scoring option and has consistently led better offences. He’s also been one of the best closers in the game.  Not for the Suns he hasn't been.  Maybe peak Paul versus peak Rubio.  The Suns beat the Lakers despite Paul's 9/8 on 44% true shooting, not because of it.    &gt;His minutes were slashed for a reason.  Which was what, exactly?  He was playing fine up to that point -- as I showed.  Did he do something off court to anger Carlisle?  &gt;And no, it is not common for your sixth man to see 33% of their ppg cut and their TS% decline by 5%.  I never said it was common for a coach to slash his 6th man's minutes by 40%, despite that player playing just fine.  But that's what Carlisle did.  &gt;And what happened after Game 3? They couldn’t hit their perimeter shots like they did the first 3 games, so Luka and the coach had less trust in them.  Doncic wasn't hitting his shots, either.  9-24.  17-37.  11-24.  &gt;Your second article references Shams reporting that it is unlikely for Pelicans to match any significant offer for Ball, and the third article literally says this:  And what, exactly, do you think that says?  It says the Pelicans may, or may not, decide to continue with Ball.  Meaning that it was precisely not ""common knowledge"" that he would leave.  As I clearly showed -- even Ball and Williamson were quoted talking about his potential return, and you damn sure don't and didn't know more about the situation than those two."
"Suns could have had  2016: Murray, Siakam or Sabonis  2017: Fox, Mitchell or Adebayo  2018 : Freaking Luka Doncic  2019 : Hachimura, Reddish, PJ Washington, Thybull anyone but Jarrett Culver...  2020 : Haliburton (his development alongside CP3 will remain a ""what if"")."
"Kings  2016- 8th Domantas Sabonis(11th), 59th Fred VanVleet (UFA)  2017- 5th Donovan Mitchell (13th), 10th Bam Adebayo(14th), 34th Dillon Brooks (45th)  Was kind of tore between Fox and Mitchell but I picked Mitchell. If Sac doesn’t trade the 10th pick, both Mitchell and Fox would be the choice at 5 and 10.   2018- 2nd Luka Doncic (3rd), 37th Gary Trent (37th but Traded to Portland)  2019- 40th Bol Bol(44th) or Eric Paschall(41st), 47th Terrence Mann(48th), 60th Naz Reid(UFA)  2020- I’m okay with the picks from 2020 2021-Too Early to Tell"
The mavs without doncic beat the bucks. They have good shooters on that team. Porzingus doesn't work well with doncic but he is good when paired with good perimeter defense. The problem with the mavs is that they are horrible defensively with both doncic and porzingus because they are forced into drop coverage and Luka can't get around screens. They are better with either porzingus alone or Luka alone(they switch everything and they are not limited with porzingus speed)
"It's hard to pick one specific team but not hard to see any one of these teams dropping off.    * Lakers: Could easily miss the playoffs and almost did last season. They're reliant on the health of their stars, who have all had questionable health lately.  * Clippers: Are missing Kawhi Leonard for the season. They'll be a team with one mid-level all-star and that's not a playoff lock in either conference.  * Warriors: Just missed the playoffs due to injuries and their return to the playoffs is largely dependant on a return to form from Klay or one of their young guys stepping up.  * Mavericks: Hyper Doncic-reliant at the moment and haven't really done anything to change that. They're a 5-10 seed depending on how good of a season Luka has.   * Blazers: Depends on what happens with Dame. Plus they've carried a ton of injuries lately.   * Jazz/Suns/Nuggets: I would say they're probably the safest 3 teams, even if they're not necessarily the best 3 teams."
"&gt;No one thought Darko was a better prospect than Melo.  The Pistons obviously did. Suggesting that no one thought that is what's idiotic.  &gt;Look at the history of how many international busts there's been  Your logic amounts to ""he's a white international player and therefore he's bust material."" I say white because we'd seen multiple successful African players before him so there wasn't a stigma around them the same way.  &gt; Taking one over a proven polished scorer that won a national championship is idiotic.  I suppose that means Ben Gordon should have gone 1st overall then? If being a great scorer on a great team is all that matters.  &gt;At least with guys like Luka he dominated the league he was in.  And that makes your revisionism okay? This is not about Luka Doncic. This is about you claiming you saw something coming with Darko that you obviously didn't. You can't claim you saw it coming because you, and virtually no one, watched him play. We relied on the professional scouting. We all did. And that scouting had him going 2nd or 3rd. Suggesting you knew better than the scouting requires some kind of reasoning beyond him being ""international."""
2021 Finals would have been  Lakers:  PG: Ja Morant  SG: Anthony Edwards  SF: LeBron James  PF: Anthony Davis  C: DeAndre Ayton  vs  Knicks:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: Ben Simmons  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Karl Anthony Towns
Luka Lillard or Dame and Doncic
"It’s like this across sports. More televisions and phones + social media = more fan engagement. More fan engagement = more merchandise sold, more spectators, thus higher tv deals = rising salary cap  Drew Brees was the first QB to get a $100m contract *11 years ago* and now, you see rising starts like Jackson and Allen commanding $300m contracts.  Luka Doncic will probably end up making (grossing) more money than Lebron by the team he’s 30 than LeBron ever made in his career.   Luka is 22 and he’s on a $200m contract, he’ll be eligible for another supermax by the time he’s 27/28 and likely *another* supermax.   We will see NBA superstars gross nearly a billion dollars when their careers are done. Just wait another 5 years when Trae Young, Luka, Tatum, Caruso, Booker, and Mitchell are the premier players in the league. They will all benefit the most from rising salary caps"
"&gt;but this year’s Suns were actually playing great basketball for the majority of the season. Hence, the difference in their overall records.  And they got their #1 overall pick back into the lineup, and swapped Kelly Oubre for Jae Crowder.  &gt;CP3 averaged 16/9 on 59.9 TS%. Rubio averaged 13/9 on 53.3 TS%. Pretty clear difference.  Not $24M worth.  &gt;But it must be fun to make up things to argue against. I said 112 combined games from 7 of the team’s top 8 players.  Which is 16 per player, well down into the bench.  &gt;Brunson’s ppg decreased by over 4 points.   Because his minutes were slashed.  &gt;His TS% decreased by over 5 percent.  Most players see a decline in that neighborhood in the playoffs.  Even Doncic saw a (smaller) 1.5% decline.  Last time Lowry made the playoffs, his dropped 3%.  &gt;There’s a reason why they had to resort to the Luka-do-it-all strategy.  No, they didn't.  They didn't in the first two games -- with Brunson playing 20 and 17 minutes, and going 4-7 in each for 15 and 9 points.  Even in G3, Brunson played 22 minutes, shot 5 for 8 for 14 points.  Dallas chose to go all-Luka later in the series, and only played Brunson 20 minutes combined in the last two games.  Do you remember the first two games of that series?  Dallas looked invincible.  They were passing the ball all over the place, and all manner of guys were hitting shots.  They shot 50% in game one, despite Doncic missing 13 of his 24 shots.  Finney-Smith and Hardaway combined to shoot 15 for 24 and score 37 points.  The whole team shot 59% in G2.  Porzingis was 8 for 12 in G2, and 7 for 12 in the game four debacle and probably their best option with Doncic unable to hit water from a boat ( 9 for 24 ).  Then he got 13 shots total in the next two games.  That series was not a masterclass in resource utilization, and was probably a fire-able offense by a coach without Carlisle's lengthy history with the franchise.  &gt;They weren’t considering keeping Ball clearly, that’s common knowledge.

"The question is had Lamelo not dropped out of high school and spent those years playing basketball overseas, would he become as well prepared for the NBA as he has displayed he is? I don't think so.   Obviously he had already made up his mind and chosen basketball as the course he would devote his life to. He wouldn't pursue anything else.  Playing in different styles of basketball in those foreign countries has served him as a learning process. Remember, some of the best  players in the NBA have come from overseas basketball, like Luka Doncic, Jokic.  Really, what kind of knowledge is taught in the high school that a rich athlete like Lamelo can not acquire without going to high school, if he wants to... About the way he speaks? I'm sure many youngsters who did graduate from high school would also speak that way. I think it would be related to Lamelo's over-confidence or cockiness.. At still 19 years of age he is looking forward possibly to earnings of  hundreds of millions of dollars.. This is no ordinary high school graduate..."

"&gt;The success of adding CP3 to Phoenix,  Lowry is not, and never has been, Chris Paul.  The Suns were only slightly worse with Ricky Rubio, when Ayton was available.  &gt;the Heat’s offence looking awful against the Bucks,  Looked a damn sight better than Toronto's over the past two seasons.  Would've looked even better if Butler could have hit water from a boat.  &gt;Luka Doncic having historical usage-rates in the postseason because THJ was the only other player who can consistently create for himself  You are assuming Doncic doesn't just shoot the ball because he can, which is more likely the case.  By the way, Dallas had one of the top backup points in the league in Brunson.  &gt;Pelicans resorting to having Zion essentially play PG for the latter half of his sophomore season catapulted the desire for Lowry to the point where Lowry could ask for more.   New Orleans had room to sign Lowry outright.  They had zero reason to trade for him.    As did Dallas, for that matter.  Really, even I think you can do better than this tripe."
"&gt;and nothing he did in the interim deserved a raise   You’ve been sleeping under a rock since April? Lowry didn’t have to do anything. The success of adding CP3 to Phoenix, the Heat’s offence looking awful against the Bucks, Luka Doncic having historical usage-rates in the postseason because THJ was the only other player who can consistently create for himself (and because they didn’t have a guard who could create for Luka), and the Pelicans resorting to having Zion essentially play PG for the latter half of his sophomore season catapulted the desire for Lowry to the point where Lowry could ask for more.   Like it’s not a coincidence that Miami, Dallas, and NOLA were the teams frontrunning the Lowry sweepstakes."
That we have Luka Doncic. The biggest diva in the league and has no first round series wins against Kawhi Leanord
"Uhhh no? I'm not coping at all  wtf, how can you get Luka doncic and cope?"
"Luka Doncic is better right now, but Trae Young’s going to finish with a better legacy.  Young's an apex predator. He’s dominating the competition right now and that’s with a terrible team. He looks at opposing players in the eyes and says: “This is my ball game, you’re witnessing greatness”.  He doesn’t have the jump-out-of-the-gym athleticism like LeBron or Jordan, but his fundamentals and Basketball IQ are off the charts. Very few players came into the league like this, Nikola Jokic comes to mind.  He’s going to be a problem for a long time"
"&gt;Harden could carry a team and average 35 ppg. Doncic can't  You mean in the playoffs or the regular season? Because Luka has done it in the playoffs and has failed to win anything significant (like Harden), and as for the regular season, Lebron/Steph/Giannis/KD/Kawhi have never done that either, so what's your point?"
"&gt; arguably the only one that doesn't entirely make sense is luka because the mavs haven't achieved anything during his tenure, but he obviously trusts mark cuban to turn that team into a contender.  Luka's been getting paid under $ 10 million a year to make All-NBA 1st teams these last two seasons. Even to the most passionate competitor, the NBA is a profession first. Damn straight he's gonna take the big bag after getting underpaid on his rookie contract. If he were to take the qualifying offer, the Mavs would trade him away. And any team that trades for Doncic would have to give up too much to actually become overpowered with him. It's better for him to just play it out until the player option year, decline that and join up with Trae and Ayton to form Heatles 2.0."
Cant wait for the debates..  *Are we sure Doncic is the best Luka?*  *Yeah fam.. Garza be ballin*  *Nah nah.. Im talkin bout Samanic*
"It actually does make sense, Luka is really good lol. Luka Doncic is your franchise, and if THJ is your 2nd best player, I feel bad for him. Can’t wait till he leaves yall in 5 years and you become irrelevant. Enjoy Jason Kidd btw, I heard he’s a great coach ! Another first round exit incoming"
"Luka Doncic, anyone who puts him as a top 10 player is out of their mind. Takes about him being better than Harden is absolutely ridiculous. Can easily name 10 players better than him.   Donovan Mitchell,  Paul Pierce, and SGA are others I can think off"
"BS is gonna say they signed him at a good number because ""you always need someone in that 15-20 mil range to put in a package"" for Luka Doncic."
Luka Doncic
"&gt; “Definitely,” Dragic said when he was asked if he’d like to play with Luka next season by Slovenian Planet TV. He more or less confirmed reports saying that Dallas is his most preferable destination, now that his run with the Miami Heat is over.  [source](https://www.eurohoops.net/en/nba-news/1235352/goran-dragic-says-hed-definitely-want-to-play-with-luka-doncic-again/)  I don’t expect a buyout to happen though, but maybe after the trade deadline it’ll be a possibility if he’s not traded elsewhere"
"Maybe if he is traded he could be like vanvleet, but Fred has never had to play with someone like Luka doncic, who controls the ball the whole game. He has comparable stats but not a comparable game"
“Too Fucking Small”  -Luka Doncic
"luka doncic, jrue holiday, jaylen brown, brandon ingram, anthony edwards, deandre ayton, SGA"
Vlade’s passing is underrated. He was probably our 2nd best passer on those 2000s Kings team. Also most famously passing on Luka Doncic.
"&gt; People killed Westbrook for averaging triple doubles on poor efficiency. Mainly his bad 3point and FT percentages with high turnovers while losing in the first round. Suddenly Luka does it and he’s Larry Bird or Lebron.  Westbrook TS%: .509  League Average: .572  Doncic: .587  In what world is being above league average in TS% being inefficient?  The playoff FT shooting was laughable, but calling Doncic inefficient is just blatantly wrong.  For qualifying 20+ scorers Doncic was 18/32 in TS%, not world breaking, but not bad and still above league average.  Westbrook was 32/32 and over 3% behind second to last place.  In fact in the last 5 years the 3 least efficient volume scorers are 2018 Westbrook, 2021 Westbrook, and 2019 Westbrook.  Comparing literally any other volume scorer to Westbrook in terms of efficiency is just wrong."
Luka Doncic
This may be true but it's irrelevant.  Whether or not he's the guy the Raps are not contenders because Kawhi left.  Luka Doncic is that guy.  The Mavs aren't close to being title contenders.
Luka Doncic is already better than Derrick Rose ever was

"Malcolm Brogdon Luka Doncic Mikael Bridges Tobias Harris  Clint Capela  No all stars, but a really good team imo"
"I'll start with one that's HUGELY unpopular on this sub:  I'd take Trae Young over Luka Doncic right now  They have almost exactly the same shooting efficiency over the last few years so that's mainly a wash  But the main reason for my view is that I think Trae is actually a better playmaker  Statisically, adjusted for usage rate, Trae's assist rate is much better  And from the eye test, I just think that Trae creates better quality looks for his teammates than Luka does(he probably creates 4-5 open dunks a game with his floater pass, which is the easiest shot of all)  Finally, I know defense will be the big divider for many people  But Trae's on/off numbers are actually superior to Luka's, his defense(which IS bad enough to hurt his team when he's on the court) is offset by the Hawks being WAY better offensively when he's on the court"
"Luka Doncic did DSJ very dirty by just been so fucking good. DSJ basically had identical rookie numbers to Russell Westbrook. Without Luka it would had taken Dallas years to see all the deficiencies of his game, he would had gotten a nice extension even without any improvement from his rookie numbers. Right now he is unsigned."
"I think you should grade players like a teacher; every player gets a 100% to start, and you start taking points off. So lebron losing in the 2011 finals was such a blow to his chance to ever be considered the goat. Tim Duncan arguably was never the best player in the league, so he statistically never was in the same category as Jordan, Kareem, or Lebron. The only thing you can take points off for jordan is not beating the pistons as the best player in the league. This is by far the most impressive resume ever.  Think of it this way is Chris Bosh and Robert Horry better than Luka Doncic and Giannis all time? No, because statistically they were never in the same realm as players."
I’m glad this streak was broken by Luka Doncic right? Right?

Luka Doncic nomination
"Even if you considered Magic Johnson's chances of winning a title his rookie season as slim, Cade's is much, much slimmer simply based on the Pistons supporting teammates vs. the Lakers squad of Abdul-Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes, Norm Nixon, Ron Boones, Michael Cooper, and Spencer Haywood, etc.  This is the equivalent of dropping a generational talent like Luka Doncic onto a championship contender like prime Tim Duncan '05 Spurs, '94 Rockets, only Magic was arguably better his rookie season than Doncic.  Still, that's probably an apt comparison at this point: a generational talent playing his rookie season on a top contender.  We don't know if Cade will be a generational talent at this point. But we do know that his current team, The Pistons, are nowhere near the 79-80 Lakers or even a team competing to make the playoffs, let alone won the championship.  My point is that Lakers team was really an anomaly, special, and there hasn't been a dynasty of winning like that since.  They went to the finals 9 out of 12 years starting with 1979-80, Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Cooper competing in 8 of those, and Magic Johnson bridging the gap in adding peices over that dynasty.  He stretched out Abdul-Jabbar's career and that Laker winning run from what would have been 2 or 3 years of the center's prime, to the most amazing end to a basketball career.  Does any of that sound like The Pistons?  If you said no, you're right because no matter how good Cade is this year, better than Magic, better than Luka, the best player ever, he doesn't have the peices on his team to go all the way and win.  Now all this is to say we just don't know but what we do know about the comparison would lead us to believe he has a very small chance to win it all.  I like Cade.  His game is great to watch.  I will be tuning into Pistons games because of him and that young, talented squad."

"Wouldn't surprise me if he becomes the unanimous best in the league next year. He is the type of guy to come out of nowhere and carry a team straight to a title, even at 23.

"&gt;Does Harden make the playoffs with the Rosters Westbrook had in OKC? Even if he gets bounced out in the first round. I personally don't think he does.  When did you start watching Basketball? James Harden has made the playoffs with bad supporting casts in his career, this isn't anything new, he's known as the #2 best floor raiser in the league for a reason.  &gt;Same goes for Dame who took the Blazers to the WCFs with CJ McCollum as his 2nd best player...  In 2015, James Harden took the rockets to a 56-26 record, with his second-best player Dwight Howard playing only 41 games that season. He went on to take the Rockets to the WCF that series averaging 27/6/7 on 62TS% that playoffs. He averaged 28/8/6 on 63TS% in the WCF. Dame, who you're praising for reaching the WCF in 19', got swept by the KD-less Warriors, blowing multiple double-digit leads in the Second half, averaging 22/5/8 on 55TS%.  &gt;lol, with Chris Paul on his team.....Chris Paul, arguably one of the best PGs ever  Yes, to take the greatest team ever assembled to 7 games you'll definitely need help, regardless in 19', when he took them to 6 games, Chris paul averaged 17/7/6 on 57TS% while shooting 31% from three, Harden averaged 35/7/5 on 59TS%. LeBron James the greatest player of this generation never took them past 5 games, and that was with one of the best pg in Kyrie, he got swept the very next season without help.  &gt;Luka averaged more points and more rebounds with a better FG than Harden this season.     What cherry-picked stats to point out lol. I'll be using a 2-year sample since a one-year regular season/playoff stats don't prove all that much  Luka Doncic: 28/9/9 on 58TS% &amp; 54efg% with 4TO in the past 2 seasons  James Harden: 30/7/9 on 62TS% &amp; 54efg% with 4TO in the past 2 seasons.  Harden is drastically more efficient, a better scorer and both are great playmakers."

well as you know with doncic when its ur guy u dont get mad. also im not mad at luka here im just mad at the refs.
Yeah search “luka Doncic stats” and go to Basketball Reference (first link). Then click for his shooting tab under stats from NBA.com.   There you can see his shots by distance.
luka doncic
"Well, we did fire them, mostly because they didn't draft Doncic. I think if we had, that whole crew would still be around. Hell, if the Bulls hadn't matched our offer to LaVine, we could've been rocking Fox/LaVine/Luka/Barnes/Holmes right now."
Yeah only other guys to do it as his age are Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic. So not a great track record
Right now Luka is better than LeBron. LeBron has taken a big step back and Doncic just kept playing better this year.
"Too small of a sample size so far for Luka but Harden is an extremely volatile shooter that can explode for 40pts on excellent TS and the next game he’ll brick 12 3s. He’s a good shooter but he isn’t elite like Dame, Durant, or Curry. If the calls aren’t going his way, it really tilts him because his efficiency depends on free throws. Still an elite slasher so he can take it to the rim but in terms of shooting he’s far from reliable, especially playoff shooting splits where his 3pt% is well below average. On the other hand Doncic has excellent 3p% with the same volume in the playoffs dude literally averaged 41% from 3 on 11 attempts per game last playoffs, 36.4% the playoffs before that. This is against the two best perimeter defenders in the league, Kawhi and PG.   Regular season, Harden has a slight edge in shooting consistency, but Luka is improving his shot selection."
Trae Young is far better than Luka Doncic purely because he can gel with any teammate while Luka plays mostly for himself.
Who do you think is better: Kyrie Irving or Luka Doncic?
Luka Doncic will not win a championship in Dallas. The ownership and management is just too sketchy.
"&gt; I think if they drafted doncic it coulda very well been another dsj situation  DSJ didn't play off-ball when Luka was drafted - it was actually the opposite. Luka only became our full time point guard once DSJ was traded. The ""DSJ situation"" happened because he's just not a good basketball player and didn't have anything to do with his inability to develop next to Luka."
What tier 1 player has the same horrendous efficiency drop off that Doncic does in the 4th?   Literally none of them you can’t criticize Luka at all with how delusional his stans are these days my lord
Dwyane Wade is the greatest person to ever touch a basketball.  Luka Doncic is the most overrated player in the league. And will never win a championship as the number 1 guy.   Ayton is never going to be a top 5 center in the league.   Shaq is all time better than Kobe.   Damian Lillard isn’t a good playoff player.  Giannis is a better player than KD.
I would argue he is third. In second place is obviously Luka Doncic behind Spurs legend Luka Samanic.
"""Patrick Beverly says guarding Luka Doncic is 'easy'."""
"&amp;#x200B;  ||20/21 EPM|20/21 RAPTOR TOTAL|20/21 LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Jokic|\+7.9 (1st)|\+9.2 (1st)|6.83 (1st)| |Embiid|\+6.4 (6th)|\+8.4 (2nd)|5.56 (5th)| |Curry|\+6.9 (3rd)|\+6.8 (6th)|5.24 (7th)| |Luka|\+5.3 (11th)|\+5.9 (13th)|4.02 (10th)|  Interesting. Luka is above Harden as well, who when he was healthy played better than him both in the regular season and in the playoffs. Very interesting.  I personally would have Luka below all of them. But i understand you may have him above Curry, Harden if you're expecting them to decline and Luka to improve. You may argue him over Embiid if youre expecting him to be hurt again. But there is currently literally 0 measurables to suggest Doncic is gonna perform better than Jokic.  Jokic is a better scorer, rebounder and defender. Playmaking is close, edge to Luka. Not a single measurable or stat thinks Luka is a better defender than Jokic, and he is less efficient from every single part of the field compared to Jokic. Luka has so far done nothing to warrant being put above Jokic, Steph, Harden and Embiid. He hasn't played better than any of them, nor has he achieved more."
"Luka has absolutely zero case for being better than Jokic. He's never won a playoff series, and just put up a 7.7 WS/5.0 VORP Season to Jokic's 15.6 WS/8.6 VORP season. Doncic has never had a season above 9 WS, whereas Jokic has had 5. And just before it's said, yes Luka is only 22, but this is a player ranking list not a player potential list. Luka has actual top 10 all-time potential, but he's just not there yet."
"I think Miami losing in the first round is way less bold than saying Luka will win MVP.  Luka got zero first-place votes last season. He got 42 points in the voting. Now, for reference, CP3 was the player who finished directly above Doncic. Paul had 139 points. Julius Randle had 20 points. So, voters thought Luka's value was multiple times closer to Randle's than CP3.   Miami won zero playoff games last year. The lost their last three playoffs games by 34, 29 and 17.   Last season, the Heat finished in 6th place in the East. If Miami doesn't finish at least in fifth place, they will be lucky to even win a first-round game vs MIL, BKN or PHI. Hawks seem on the verge of a breakout (and finished ahead of MIA last season.) Maybe the Heat could jump the Knicks, but there's also the chance BOS jumps MIA.   I don't have anything against Lowry, but he will also be 36 before the season ends and, with the exception of the Kawhi year, has/had a reputation of coming up short when it matters most."
Luka doncic when his bum team loses to contenders in the first round both years: “Lmao what a fat loser he shouldn’t be top 5”  Stefraud Curry when he can’t make the playoffs with a elite playmaker/DPOY candidate: “Curry is actually better than KD imo”
Right so Luka Doncic is still a prospect because he’s still improving. You’re a genius my friend.
They're halfway to Luka Doncic!
"Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Steve Nash  I love shooting and playmaking and point guards in general"

"As a Rockets fan, Harden was my boy. But give me the choice now of who I would rather have, I would take Luka Doncic without a doubt. Harden just found ways to disappear when it mattered."
"Lol of course a clippers FAN think i’m a DUMBASS.   You guys SUCK lol LUKA DONCIC is averaging SO MANY PPG on you all but you need your big 3 of KaWHY, PG13TO, and SCOTT FOSTER to carry you … past one KING.   if  Clippers were in a small marketNO ONE would know who those scrubs were…   LUKA MAGIC baby."
If I did this for the modern NBA and try not to make it too crazy:  Ben Simmons  Lonzo Ball  Luka Doncic  Robert Covington  Bamonte Adebayo
"Height makes a little difference, helping with Luka having the advantage in paint points, defense, rebounding and game flow creation. Health probably bleeds in as well.  I would still have no confidence in saying, that Luka already contributes more to winning than Harden, because Harden is objectively the better shooter.  The Harden is underrated on defense narrative gotta stop though. He is a really good post up defender and his gambling on steals sometimes works, but that's it and it's not worth a lot.  Post up defense by guards is near worthless, because being good at something that happens 1 or 2 times in a game is of miniscule value and chasing steals only works with good help defenders at your side, who plug the holes, when the gamble goes wrong.  Doncic is perfectly mediocre on defense for a NBA rotation player, Harden is subpar overall on that end."
"Luka is AMAZING.   Imagine if you combined JORDAN’s finishing ability with LEBRON’s court vision with DUNCAN’s defense with KOBE’s back-to-the-basket midrange game with WILT’s dominance and BIRD’s versatility.   Thank you, Luka Doncic for saving Dallas, Texas."
Yet Doncic isn't even the leading scorer during his own playoff career.  He's third behind Durant (34.3) and Mitchell (33.9).  |Rk|Player|From|To|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2021|2021|34.3|.630| |2|Donovan Mitchell|2020|2021|33.9|.640| |3|Luka Doncic|2020|2021|33.5|.582| |4|Damian Lillard|2020|2021|30.3|.646| |5|Ja Morant|2021|2021|30.2|.578|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/23/2021.
"Bob taking shots at [Donnie Nelson](https://theathletic.com/1667603/2020/03/11/finding-luka-doncic/?redirected=1), confirming all of the reporting about how much they hated each other.  &gt; Twenty years after discovering Dirk Nowitzki in the German wine country, the Dallas Mavericks find Luka Doncic, another generational player from Central Europe, in the city of Madrid. The “Wonder Boy” from Ljubljana, Slovenia, this kid who first attracted the Mavericks’ attention as a 13-year-old and whose talents once inspired their executives to hide out in a nondescript hotel on a scouting trip just to disguise their affections, takes fewer than two seasons to assert himself as an MVP candidate who can carry their franchise for the next two decades. &gt;  &gt; The serendipity of it all is nothing short of storybook. &gt;  &gt; And how’s this for a reminder that the draft has the power to both humble or help any team: If Mavs owner Mark Cuban hadn’t overruled general manager Donnie Nelson in 2013 when he wanted to take a skinny Greek kid named Giannis Antetokounmpo, who would go on to become the reigning MVP, Dallas would never have been in this position to begin with. Plan Bs don’t turn out much better than this."
"[Woj] Sources around the league tell us Luka Doncic is trading Kristaps Porzingis to the OKC Thunder for a 2nd rounder. With the free space, the Mavericks intend to sign Crancar, Prepelic and Tobey. Sources also tell us Luka Doncic is closing in a deal with Masai, where Goran Dragic would be traded in exchange for Mark Cuban's Shark Tank."
"Has anyone reminded them that Bob “probably had some input” into the Luka Doncic deal, according to Simmons!?"
"Sure, unless that anti-vaxxer has the talent of a Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Greek Freak, etc.   I'm sure most people would rather have the young socialite than Wiggins even if he was vaccinated lmao."
Luka Doncic is not making it.  I doubt Lillard is making it.
Its a cultural thing. Its not that deep. Look at luka doncic? What extra twitch muscles is he using to be so dominant?
"No, pretty much 55/60 rookies priority is already fit (propably an even bigger percentage for internationals) and when it comes down to those elite 5 talents, I think it isn't that easy. I doubt Zion (as an example) would have gone to the Lakers being a 2nd unit guy behind LBJ and Davis, but I do think Charlotte would have had a good chance. Derrick Rose would have ended up in Chicago for sure and OKC would have had a good chance to get Blake Griffin or Trae Young. Back in 2013 OKC would have been the team that could have snatched some elite rookie, in the 2000s San Antonio and Detroit could have delivered great opportunities. I think this 'big market doomsday scenario' isn't really realistic. They all have billionaires funding the whole thing, there are enough options convincing a young player of yourself, especially those who just want to ball. If a Luka Doncic is ballsy enough to step into the spotlight right away, then I'm also cool with it."
Did really no one say Luka Doncic?
"Larry Legend,  imagine a better, more efficient version of Luka Doncic. That's Bird; Magic Johnson called him the greatest player in the world at one point in the 80s.  3 straight mvps.  A prime Bird is better than prime Lebron.  Clutch at 3 pointers, clutch at free throws and clutch at the end"
"If Luka Doncic doesn't change mentally and his playstyle, he won't go nowhere.   ^((no slander or hate, just extremely hot and blasphemous take as OP request, do not blast me lmao))"
"&gt; Imagine the scandal if Luka Doncic or Tyler Herro went to FO after coach gets fired and said it is important that the head coach is white  You're right, it would be a scandal for Tyler Herro to think he has enough clout to participate in the coaching search. Riley would kill him.  Luka just chose Kidd, so your scenario fails there as well."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
If Luka Doncic can relate more to a white HC and that the team will play better through having one then you have no issue with him requesting that....?
"""It's important to hire a white coach.""  -Luka Doncic   You're telling me that it wouldn't be considered racist if Luka made those comments?   Gtfo. No one should be asking for a specific race to be hired over another. Can you coach? Period."
Imagine the scandal if Luka Doncic or Tyler Herro went to FO after coach gets fired and said it is important that the head coach is white
Beating teams who were also injured. Mitchell was re-injured by kawhi and didnt look the same again at the end of one of the games.   They nearly lost to Luka Doncic playing on a below average team.   Nuggets beat them in the bubble. Not saying 100% nuggets would win but Jokic currently destroys this team stylistically.
I don't think you've put enough consideration into the fact that Trae Young is closer to Luka Doncic than Doncic is to James Harden!
"Kawhi: No left hand   LeBron: ever since his heat days from 3-10 ft the past 7 yrs %s have fallen off probably where the declining athleticism shows(last season in the small sample his %s were better there)  Durant: cant fight over screens on ball at all, if you watch for it you wont not be able to see it  Harden: Only throws passes with his left hand, too many other passing tendencies.   Luka Doncic: Worse catch and shoot/spot up shooter than you would realize, have heard many theories on it my suspicion is it has to do with his mechanics especially compared to his step back where he's most comfortable"
"Mike Conley  Patty Mills  Jrue Holiday  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Boban Marjanovic  Is your list a joke OP? Derrick Rose said some kind of messed up stuff at a trial, Steven Adams has been voted one of the dirtiest players in the league, Bobby Portis punched a teammate, and a lot of people don't like how much Luka Doncic complains about calls."
PG: Malcom Brogdon (4)  SG: Luka Doncic (1)  SF: Saddiq Bey (3)  PF: Robert Covington (5)  C: Anthony Davis (2)  6: Gary Trent Jr. (6)  7: Mo Bamba (7)
"Luka doncic nobody took seriously when he was drafted… then 3 games in people are like “whooooaaaa, this guy can ball”"
And that kid is Luka doncic
"you are not going to take off Luka Doncic, even if the Mavs were terrible he’s great enough that you have to include him"
"What you're looking for are superstar/star players who run their teams offense and/or rarely play off-ball *or* focus on creating their own shot.  For example, the best-worst team (with some wiggling of positions) I can think of would be;  PG: Trae Young  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Joel Embiid  To be fair Embiid would probably slot in alright, but in terms of star C's it's really either him or Jokic and I worry the latter would be able to corral the rest of the time into playing well off-ball."
"If Porzingis can’t play at an All-Star level for the rest of his contract that’s pretty disastrous. The opportunity cost when you spend $30 million on essentially a role player (who is hurt 40% of the time anyways) is colossal, especially when you’re trying to keep Luka Doncic happy."
"It’s always hilarious how people claim that the league today isn’t immensely more talented than it ever was when guys like Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Damian Lillard are lower top ten."
I'm perplexed that people keep posting Luka Doncic clips after we already established that Trae Young is closer to Doncic than Doncic is to Harden.
Euroleague Luka Doncic ain't beating the Pacers
Luka Doncic this past playoffs in the 1st Round against the Clippers  35.7 PPG on 49/41/53 splits.

Luka Doncic | Dallas Mavericks: 35 points (16.7% first-place votes)  4. Joel Embiid | Philadelphia 76ers: 14 points (5.6% first-place votes)  5. James Harden | Brooklyn Nets: 11 points (5.6% first-place votes)  6. Stephen Curry | Golden State Warriors: 10 points  7. LeBron James | Los Angeles Lakers: 7 points  Those are  the MVP predictions and the Nets are #1 for Champion with 80 points,Lakers 2nd with 49,Bucks 3rd with 30 and nobody else got more than 4 points in the vote"
Nah I just hate Luka Doncic

"&gt;	I mean, even though they’re not cooler Luka Doncic is a loveable munchkin ❤️ Edit - He’s not short by any means, it’s just any time I see Luka he’s either adorable or as red as a tomato from trying to carry his team  https://i.imgur.com/Ey4Ew7I.jpg"
"Dragan Bender, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Dario Saric, Enes Kanter, Jonas Valanciunas, Jan Vesely, Ricky Rubio.  It's not that hard to understand. The hit rate on the top international guys leading up to Doncic was very poor, and Luka had worse physical tools than most of them. Ricky Rubio was billed as a can't miss guy in a similar vein to Luka, and then he missed."
"&gt; Also is his name Luka Jaquarious, Jaquarious Doncic, or just Jaquarious?  Why are all 3 hilarious"
"I mean, even though they’re not cooler Luka Doncic is a loveable munchkin ❤️"
Nuclear take incoming but Luka Doncic is better than 40 year old twice retired MJ.
Luka Doncic is a euro player and he’s already better than everyone in your franchise history. Stop crying.
"Just give it a few years. Luka is in for some prime time hate in the back half of his 20s, even when all the LeBron folks switch to Doncic after James retires."
Luka doncic&gt; yes
Luka Doncic &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Now where's my gold?
"&gt;You are ranking the 75th best all time.  The current player isn't done playing yet, so putting them on a best of all time list is premature at best and certainly unnecessary to the integrity of the list itself.  &gt;You think a Lebron shouldn’t be on there because it’s “creating a huge mess”.  Sort of, I think adding Lebron on there opens the door for making the case for KD to be added on the list.  If KD is on there, it makes a compelling case for Kawhi. If Kawhi should make it, surely Steph is good enough to make it? If Steph is on there...  So where do you draw the line on adding current players and perhaps more importantly, who are you denying a spot for among retired players?  Are we going to get to a point where we feel we should be adding Luka Doncic and taking Larry Bird off the list? I know that's clearly an exaggeration, but it's to drive home the arbitrariness of who makes the list and who doesn't if you include active players *relative* to leaving them off until they retire and they do this list again in 5 years."
"&gt;nba player luka doncic said winning in the olympics is much harder than in the nba  Yeah, no shit. Slovenia isn't exactly a basketball powerhouse."
Luka Doncic
"the truth is Zion is a great basketball player, he's gifted, but sports media needs a new LeBron and soon.  You're exactly right.  Zion also has been overshadowed by Ja Morant, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Devin Booker, and DeAndre Ayton.  Those last three guys were the business in those playoffs.  They NEED a new number one best player undisputed"
"Look all Imma say about this, is that New Orleans was probably the worst place Zion could go. Smallest market in the league and front office that doesnt seem very competent. The only saving grace is he gets to play with Brandon Ingram. Everyone is aware just how much the hype of his college season has died down despite him proving that the hype was warranted. I think instagram followers is a pretty good way to measure how popular a player is and Zion's has been trending downwards instead up, despite his fantastic season. Just look at his social blade. https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/zionwilliamson/monthly This is in stark difference to his contemporaries like ja morant, lamelo ball Nd Luka doncic whose social media are still climbing at a consistent pace. Although Zion is also not the best at marketing himself. Players care about this stuff more than you would think. If the Pelicans don't show they can build a consistent playoff team around him, I think it's entirely possible that he might want out earlier than expected."
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De’Aaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I’d rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D’Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"I believe that if it wasnt for Dražens tragic death, noone serious would ever rate him above Kukoč.  Even here in Croatia, where the Petrović is almost some mythical national figure, theres no clear consensus about whos the best Croatian player of all time.  Most serious baskteball fans rate Kukoč higher because on top of him being a far more verastile player, he achieved far more in club ball both in europe and in the NBA.  The way i see it, Petrović was a world class shooter and offensive player and Kukoč was Luka Doncic before Luka Doncic"
Luka Doncic. Don’t like his ref whining and foul baiting
Ya and Luka Doncic had the greatest European MVP season ever because he did it when he was 18 years old.
"In terms of what? I mean most euros historically are on the older side since the waive of drafting young euro prospects is fairly new. And summer league as mentioned doesn’t matter, but here are some euros that exceeded expectations as rookies and had strong seasons: Dario Saric (best comparison imo), bogdan bogdanovic, Luka Doncic, kristaps, Pau and Rubio"

"They do, but at the same time the media won't allow a player averaging 50/25/2 to not win MVP. By and large, there isn't really an MVP in the last 15 years that you can say the media got it completely wrong, there's debates here and there (2005 and 2011 come to mind), but that's to be expected when hundreds of people are voting.  Players aren't reliable for this, what are the odds that James Harden watches Luka Doncic night in and night out? Or that Joel Embiid watches Damian Lillard often. They have scouting reports, but these guys have more to do than watch the Mavs play the Kings in a random Wednesday night."
"You're still massively ignoring the 1st-Team point and using some unsavory tactics while doing so. Stockton, despite being seen as the best point guard of his era, only made 2 1st-teams after Mark Price got injured to fuck, MJ retired the first time, and Magic Johnson had been out of the league for 3 years by the time John made his first 1st-Team. It took all of those things for Stockton to make his only 1st-Teams.  Meanwhile, Nash had Kidd, Kobe, Iverson, McGrady, CP3, Wade, Deron Williams, Tony Parker, and Chauncey Billups taking votes away from him. During Nash's best years, only McGrady missed significant time with injuries among the guys named.  During CP3's career, he's had majority-healthy seasons from Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Wade, Nash, TP, D-Will, Kobe, and on/off years from Kyrie, John Wall, and Luka Doncic to contend with.  Both Nash/Kidd and Paul had tougher, healthier competition than Stockton. If we're to believe that Stockton is this top-50 great, his only real contender post-91 was MJ for a guard spot, but another guard was always seen as better.  On voting for the top 50: ""These 50 players were selected through a vote by a panel of media members, former players and coaches, and current and former general managers."" Players were only a portion of the voting, so your point there doesn't hold up. And players didn't pick the Dream Team; the USA Basketball committee selected them. ""It's almost as if..."" your points don't hold up."

Yeah you’re not gonna convince anyone ever that the Mav’s problem was that Luka Doncic had the gaul to put up 37.5 ppg on 57 TS while being guarded by 2 of the best perimeter defenders of the generation.   That’s like saying KD is a problem player because he doesn’t defer to Blake Griffin enough.
"You’re getting the causality reversed. Luka doesn’t ice his teammates because he shoots too much. Luka shoots too much because his teammates can’t create for themselves.  Porzingis is 200% a shell of himself. I’m hoping he regains athleticism and returns to form next year but right now you don’t want a significant amount of offense running through him, and you can’t even blame that on doncic. Porzingis’ low usage was clearly a mandate from carlisie."
"No, I think Luka doncic holds the ball too much and shoots too many garbage shots, its not that complicated.   Even unbiased mavs fans (non-slovenians) could tell you that its not out of the ordinary for him to look off porzingis"

"&gt; Also James Harden is primarily a SG.  I guess Harden averaged 11 apg last year, was listed as a PG and was called the PG of the team by Kyrie Irving for fun.  Also, Trae Young and Luka Doncic aren't better than Russell Westbrook? The same Trae Young that led the Hawks to the ECF last year while averaging 29 and 9 and the same Luka that averaged 36 against Kawhi/PG?  Wow, what joining the Lakers does to people, Russ went from not even making All-NBA last year to being better than Luka freaking Doncic."
"Interestingly enough, neither Aldridge or Roy were actually drafted by Portland themselves.  That front office was on point that draft night.  Hopefully in the future, Luka Doncic &amp; Jalen Brunson are the answer to this same question :)"

Ahh.. yes the great White AMERICAN Luka Doncic.. how could i forget him.
"He’s still one of the best defenders in the league when he’s in the playoffs, he held Luka doncic to 30% fg percentage."
"It's really inhibited Luka Doncic so far, clearly.    /s"
"Luka. He and Jason Kidd will feud, Kidd's assistants (also former teammates) will side with him and Doncic will request a trade. He'll get moved to Chicago for Zach LaVine and picks."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Luka drove as much to the basket as Trae last season, but Doncic finishes much better near the rim, because he is taller. Fouling Trae is also dumber, because he is a good foul shooter, while Luka is just mediocre. Fewer people foul on jump shots, more when an opposing player is near the rim and would get a high percentage shot attempt off.  Luka still baits a lot of fouls, but more often on bigs and forwards, who foul more frequently in general.   I think, despite the rule changes, he might get even more free throws in the future, because his playstyle in the paint forces a lot of contact there and with age, experience and stature in the league, he'll pretty soon get the star treatment from the refs."
"I often see players comparations in style and skills, like Jordan and Kobe or Iverson and Irving. I can see the similarities, but one of them pisses me off.  Lebron and Doncic. Just no. For me Luka is similar to Harden and Lebron is still unique."
"KD &amp; Jokic have some of the deepest bags in the league.  I would also include Embiid, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, Luka Doncic and CJ McCollum on there as well.  LeBron also has a pretty excellent bag of tricks but it feels like he has relied so much on being bigger, stronger &amp; faster than everyone to get to his spots it's not as flashy as some of the other guys on this list."
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
"You best hope Luka worked on those free throws, hate for Hack-a-Doncic to cost you the play-ins☹"
Good thing Mitchell doesn't play with back to back first round exit champion Luka Doncic or he'd be stood in the corner all game waiting for passes that are never coming.
"From the interview   “**One player comes to mind as you bring up all of these ideologies and sports science methods the Heat have used the last few seasons: Tyler Herro. Massive talent, but doesn’t always crack the rotation. How do you bring him along with your brand of tough love?**  Oh man, he’s a tough kid. He’s tougher than a lot of people think. He wants the tough love, actually.  **Really?**  I tiptoed around it a few times, but he said, “Nah, OG. I ain’t soft.” He wants it. I give him that. I wasn’t sure about him. I saw him play in college. He’s not soft at all. Just needed to get stronger. He has the will, has the passion, has the right mindset. He just wasn’t physically there yet. People forget he was 19 years old. And regardless of how well he played offensively, he was still only 19. A lot of people took advantage of that, and, rightfully so...a lot of people took it upon themselves to put [Herro] in a lot of actions and beat him up out there. But offensively? I’ve never seen a kid be able to do what he was able to do at 19 or 20 years old. But, hell yeah: he can take it. He definitely can take it. He part of the Dog Pound now. OG love you to death. But I will be brutally honest wit’ yo’ ass, boy.  **He said recently that he deserves to be in the same conversation as Luka Doncic and Trae Young and the other young stars of the NBA. Is that what you’ve seen?**  Facts. He just hasn’t been given the keys. He came to a team that’s been successful and didn’t need a superstar right away...he came into a different situation. But skillswise, talent wise, damn right. Them other boys ain’t been to the Finals yet, and that’s not to knock them, but you see what [Herro] did. Boy got game. Straight up and down. And if he was on a team, probably not a good team, and he got to go out there and do his thing? Damn right he’d be in those conversations.”"
Trae young is more impactful than luka doncic

"Lakers tax. AD is held to a different standard since joining the Lakers especially a team with Lebron.  I agree with your post 100%. In AD’s last full season with the Pelicans he was 24, just 2 years older than current Doncic. He still lead a team with a terrible front office and roster to the playoffs twice and was only eliminated by Warriors on both occasions. At the age of 24 he swept the 3rd seed blazers without Boogie who was his best teammate.   People like to bring up Jrue but ignore how injury prone he was with the Pelicans. In his first 4 seasons with them he missed a combined of 100+ missed games. The first year he is healthy and plays over 70 games they sweep the third seed.   People forget he was on the smallest market with the worst front office who kept getting weird fits around him. Everytime he had a remotely decent squad he showed up. He was only 24 too, at that age Giannis had 2 all star appearances and was still solidifying himself as a star and wasn’t a superstar yet.   This sub will use every excuse to defend a player they like such as Luka (Porzingis is ass etc.) but when it’s a player they don’t like they don’t want to hear it."
I don’t think Luka Doncic is God.
Luka Doncic will be on the goat conversation once he's done
Lamelo hall has a higher ceiling that luka doncic and has the highest ceiling in the NBA. People are too afraid to put him on such a high pedestal since he is so young.
"I'm just thinking of people like Luka Doncic who were playing at a pro level in Europe already, so they probably could have come to the NBA one or two years early and start balling out"
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
"There are only 9 players in the league on supermaxes: Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Rudy Gobert."
"Trae Young is a better overall player than Luka Doncic  He's still pretty ball dominant but not quite as much and creates better looks(there's no more high quality pass than into an open dunk, which he creates far more often)  Luka should be a better scorer in theory but in practice they've been about equally efficient on similar volume  Trae is obviously the worse defender but Luka is pretty terrible himself  Also Luka doesn't do much in 4th quarters because of his conditioning"
Put some respect on Luka Doncic name!!!
"Well doncic put 46/7/14 against the clippers, which is a conference finals team also. I don't think its fair to say that HE needs to come our of the first round with that god awful team. I mean, he played insanely good its not like its his fault they lost. But to say:   &gt;highest level of basketball  I really don't understand that. He had 2 of the best defenders on him a whole series and still played out of this world.   &gt;pretty equal honestly  Agree to disagee. Respect to trae, but i think Luka is better."
No one could hear you over everyone telling us that Luka Doncic was BETTER than Lebron James
The Luka Doncic special
"Doncic for sure.  He can score on his own from anywhere.  Both are average to terrible defenders and both may be a liability on a team come playoff time.  Luka is incredible is closing moments, athletic or not.  I would take him for sure and surround with shooters and defenders"
He’s much improved on that end but he’s not a difference maker as a defender (neither is Doncic obviously) and I think most people are pointing out that the center is the most important defensive position to have a difference maker. But I have no issue with picking Jokic for this exercise. You’re just betting that Luka won’t be better than Jokic is currently 4 years from now.
"Doncic because he's easier to build around imo. On a team with a defensive anchor / lob threat, and a secondary ball handler / scorer Luka would be crazy good."
"Trae Young is as good as Luka Doncic or that it's a ""legit convo"""
It's not worth taking centers high in the draft unless you're sure that they're gonna be legit stars. Case in point: Deandre Ayton over Luka Doncic

"Been saying it all alone, the Mavs are a very bad team outside of Luka. Even if I didn't like Carlisle you gotta give it to him, he did everything he could to put the role players in a position to he effective. The biggest problem however is how the roster is constructed. They don't have that many assets to trade away. THJ sure, but he's not someone many GMs would make serious offers for, there are many players around the league of his profile who are also cheaper and/or younger. And KP well, I still haven't lost hope on him but his trade value is down, has a big contract and I don't know who would be desperate enough to pull the trigger on him. Also having Luka means not being in the lottery and even if they were, the Mavs have a poor draft record over the years (Doncic aside of course)"
"Karl Anthony towns. Luka doncic in a couple of years. Damian Lillard. The whole Celtics roster rn. Jimmy butler and Joakim Noah by the bulls.  Best in the world type player, surrounded by average or injury prone stars.  Idk wtf is going on with the Celtics, they seem to be going lower and lower down the pecking order. Heat, Sixers and maybe the bulls will wash them in a couple of years."
Cavs Legend Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic is the real deal. I cant believe Phoenix Suns passed on this guy. Worst blunder ever.
Luka Doncic
"Luka ""Russell Westbrook"" Doncic"
Luka “Freethrow Merchant” Doncic showed up
off-ball luka doncic and post-up porzingis....are choices....
"He can't even post up properly because they put some burly wings (or guards, if you have a Marcus Smart) on him and he gets shoved off his spot before he can do anything  Dude should just embrace being a rich man's Splash Mountain Brook Lopez and fire away from 3, fuck the post up just spam the pick&amp;pop with Luka Doncic."
"Hot controversial take: Tatum is not that good. He can’t elevate the team like an MVP candidate (Luka, Doncic, Curry, KD, Harden, Lebron, Giannis, Embiid, Kawhi, Lillard, AD) even second tier MVP candidate players can raise their team’s ceiling more than him (Booker, Trae, Mitchell, PG13).   He is closer to Beal/Lamelo than Lillard."
"That may be but man… I’ve not really ever been a fan of KP and he just looks like the worst version of himself right now: shooting from all over the court instead of using his length, poor defense, not fast enough to rely on getting down court in transition. I honestly think the Pistons minus Cade Cunningham are a flat out better team than the Mavericks minus Luka Doncic."
"Yeah, Luka was my first thought. I seriously think a case can be made that the Detroit Pistons roster 2-15 (so minus Cade Cunningham) plus Dwayne Casey is a better team than the Mavs sans Doncic with Jason Kidd."
7’5 Luka Doncic with Curry’s shooting Rodman rebounding Kareem post game and Lebron’s athleticism. Someone like that could do pretty well.
"Way too small of a sample size. In this clip are a few ok contests, but those are normal shots for Luka, that he just didn't make. Hunter did nothing special, the real road blocks for Doncic were Capela, Collins and Dieng, who did a great job protecting the paint after the perimeter guys were beaten."
"Yes he did lol   I watched the video right after I posted that comment just to make sure and it said it word for word   “I FEEL LIKE I’M IN THE SAME CONVERSATION AS THOSE GUYS, THE YOUNG GUYS COMING UP IN THE LEAGUE WHO CAN BE ALL-STARS, SUPERSTARS ONE DAY. LUKA [DONCIC], TRAE [YOUNG], JA [MORANT], THOSE GUYS LIKE THAT. I FEEL LIKE MY NAME SHOULD BE IN THAT CATEGORY, TOO””"
I’m taking Horry over Luka doncic
How does one clamp Luka Doncic? What is this power?
Luka Doncic
he got most of his pts in garbage time when they started to get blown out look up luka doncic game 7 highlights he was scoring at the end of the game when it was over but between the 3rd qtr and the middle of the 4th he was getting strapped by kawhi plus the 6ers dont switch when simmons was in the game he is on trae and when thybulle comes in he gets on trae but he still at the end of the day put 29 &amp; 11 against 2 players on the all defensive team in his first playoff run
nephews  &gt;1 game in  &gt;OMG JASON KIDD HAS RUINED!!! TARNISHED!!!! THE DALLAS MAVERICKS!!! LUKA DONCIC WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!!!  anyone with a brain  &gt;yo its 1 game in??...  🤔
"Again go compare the rosters their first two years in the league which is what I specifically commented on. Mavs were way more talented and Trae still had more assists than Doncic and Trae had a way worse coach. Trae is better as a passer and playmaker.   Even last year when the lineups were closer in talent(Hawks had massive injuries all year, heck freaking Solo got massive minutes) the Hawks were 12 points better when Trae was on the floor vs the Mavs only being 8 points better when Luka was on. Trae elevated this team to another level"
"luka doncic, notorious bad passer"
Just like this sub. I guess we can all be all time greats coz istg we got memories of a goldfish. Now all of a sudden Trae Young is significantly better than Luka Doncic after one game
"&gt;	“I feel like I’m in the same conversation as those guys, the young guys coming up in the league who can be All-Stars, superstars one day. Luka [Doncic], Trae [Young], Ja [Morant], those guys like that. I feel like my name should be in that category too.”  There is no want there. He really feels it. But that isn't wrong to say, that's confidence. But it's objectively wrong at this point."
Luka left humanity behind in the Clippers Mavs series last year averaging 35/10/8. His supposed second best teammate Porzingis scored single digits 3 times that series including two crucial losses in games 3 and 6 where Porzingis completely disappeared. If Doncic and say Paul George or Kawhi switched teams then the Clippers would destroy the Mavericks

"Yeah that's what the awesome Mavs offense from the last 2 years needed : less Luka Doncic pick and roll, more KP and DFS post up.  Thank god coaching mastermind Jason Kidd is here to show them the way, maybe he should try to post up Maxi Kleber too next game"
"2001: Pau Gasol (3rd)  2002: Yao Ming (1st)  2003: LeBron James (1st), Carmelo Anthony (3rd)  2004: Dwight Howard (1st)  2005: Deron Williams (3rd)  2006: LaMarcus Aldridge (2nd)  2007: Kevin Durant (2nd)  2008: Derrick Rose (1st)  2009: Blake Griffin (1st), James Harden (3rd)  2010: John Wall (1st)  2011: Kyrie Irving (1st)  2012: Anthony Davis (1st), Bradley Beal (3rd)  2013: nil  2014: Joel Embiid (3rd)  2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  2016: Ben Simmons (1st), Brandon Ingram (2nd), Jaylen Brown (3rd)  2017: Jayson Tatum (3rd)  2018: Luka Doncic (3rd)  2019: Ja Morant (2nd)  You could argue that some of these players aren’t “superstars” but everyone I’ve listed is all-star calibre. Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don’t result in superstars is flat out wrong."
Can we all agree that the Luka Doncic to Dallas and Trae Young to Hawks is the most best and fair trade ever?
"The true comparison is Luka vs. Trae &amp; Reddish.  Even the Hawks FO agreed that Doncic was better (or at least believed his value in trade was higher) since they drafted him.  The overall balance of that deal can be argued multiple ways but I'm content to say most Atlanta fans are happy with it as are Dallas fans.  It was frustrating when Bill Simmons and his ilk proclaimed it as decided back in 2019.  I'd argue that Young under Rick Carlisle vs. Doncic under Lloyd Pierce would have been a closer match.  Pierce was such a shitty strategist and so bad at personal relationships that a ""journeyman"" like Nate Macmillan looks like Red Auerbach comparatively."
His name?  Luka Doncic
"Ah yes the Mavs' two best players, Luka and Doncic"
Did elite playmaker Luka Doncic not set him up well??
The real loser of that trade was Luka Doncic.
Do people want Luka Doncic to play off-ball just for the fuck of it? Do you really think more Porzingis post-ups and Tim Hardaway Jr. ballhandling is the key to Dallas taking the next step? Lmfao. The team as currently constructed is best with Doncic running shit.
"4 years of Luka Doncic on rookie contract and this is the roster you ended up with, bravo Cuban"
Top 5 Superstar Luka Doncic should probably go takeover mode
But you have top 5 superstar Luka Doncic??
How is MVP Favorite Luka Doncic letting this bad eastern conference team hang around
How do the Mavs have bad ball movement when they have elite playmaker Luka Doncic?
"Dame is a better player than Parker, there's no argument there. But Parker had a far better career than Dame has to this point, which i'm pretty sure is what this list is based off of or guys like Luka Doncic would be on there since he's a better player than half of the fucking list."
"Fill in this sentence, “Without Luka Doncic, the Mavs are ______________.”"
Funner fact: Luka Doncic has yet to lose a game for the 2021-2022 NBA season. Take that as you will
"It's not a bad one [actually think the best odds of any of these is Harden +2000](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/2022-nba-mvp-betting-odds-luka-doncic-joel-embiid-nikola-jokic) though, no Kyrie  and Durant inevitably missing time means I think there's a path to which enough voters for him. I actually bet on the Jazz U at 53.5 wins for this yr, I think expectations are probably too high"
Doncic 1? In order for that to happen he will need to haul the mavs to a top 2 seed. And whilst luka is amazing idk about that
Yup keep in mind I am a Sixers fan but when I looked up Doncic coming out of the draft he seemed to be by far the best prospect he had that irrational bravery that can sink a player or make home swim and Luka had the skills to swim for days. Kinda the same thing for Lamelo he has that irrational confidence but he has some great skill to back that his confidence up.
"I’m not talking about career accomplishments    I’m talking about how good they were at basketball. There are not 50 players in the history of the league who in their prime are as as good relative to their competition as Luka Doncic is right now    The only players better than Luka currently playing are like top 20 all time level guys (Curry, KD, Bron, Giannis, Kawhi, etc) and Luka is still almost on that tier already.    Luka could never improve again, hell he could get 20% worse and as long as he doesn’t have an injury riddled career he will end up as a 10-15x all star, 10-15x all nba and a first ballot hall of famer"
"Bad take. Even if Wiseman ends up accomplishing absolutely nothing in the NBA, you can’t compare Lamelo to Luka yet. He’s gonna be a great player for sure but it’s way too early to say that he’s a generational talent like Doncic"
How good is Luka Doncic really?
"Steph, Giannis, Jokic, Kawhi should be a lock.   Personal hot take, I want Luka Doncic to get in there (even though he probably doesn't deserve it yet) . The production he's doing at the young age of 22 is staggering and is probably better than Dave Bing idk HAHAHAHA"

"This is actually a very interesting question for the Mavs since it was a year post-championship after Cuban didn't bring Tyson Chandler back.  11-12: Jason Kidd / Vince Carter / Shawn Marion / Dirk Nowitzki / Brendan Haywood   21-22: Luka Doncic / Tim Hardaway Jr / Dorian Finney Smith / Maxi Kleber / Kristaps Porzingis   &amp;#x200B;  I think I'd take the current starting lineup over the champion defending lineup, especially since that team was dealing with the Lamar Odom issues."
John Salmons (and Luka Doncic) accepted my LinkedIn invite to be connected - my greatest professional achievement
"Why is this getting downvoted? You’re right!   I would prefer free health care over shoes I will grow out of in half a year. But providing this is not exactly Luka Doncic’ job now, is it?"
"22-year-old scoring a moderately efficient 24ppg.   47.5% from the field, 37.1% from 3, 57.3 TS%. He's not a chucker by any measure.  It's a very fair request.   Looking at all +24ppg scorers ≤25-years-old from last season:    Player| Age| PPG ---|---|---- Zion Williamson| 20 | 27.0 **Collin Sexton**| **22** | **24.3** Luka Doncic| 22 | 27.7 Trae Young | 22 | 25.3 De'Aaron Fox| 23 | 25.2 Jayson Tatum| 23 | 26.4 Devin Booker| 24 | 25.6 Donovan Mitchell | 24 | 26.4 Jaylen Brown| 24 | 24.7 Karl-Anthony Towns| 25 | 24.8   I just don't see how Sexton doesn't clear 100m easily if he can keep it up. If you're in that age bracket and you're in that scoring bracket, it's a no-brainer.  We're not even talking about a 5-year max either."
We will never forget the kings passed on Luka Doncic for fucking bagley
Luka Doncic is in better shape than 99.99999% of the people in the world.
MVP - Luka Doncic   ROY - Jalen Green   DPOY - Matisse Thybulle (if he doesn’t get enough minutes then AD   6MOTY - Jordan Clarkson   MIP - Furkan Korkmaz   COY - Michael “Michael” Malone
"It doesn't really matter what they *need* though, if that's not something they can actually *get.*   The Kings could say they need Luka Doncic, but that doesn't mean they can ever swap Bagley for him."
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis, Trae Young and Luka Doncic together have provided zero on court value in the 2021-2022 NBA season so far."
"He should get lessons from the classiest nba player, luka doncic"
"You can't blame Phoenix for not drafting Luka Doncic #1. There was no way of knowing how good he'd be. He was of course a prodigy, but he wasn't the first prodigy from Europe to enter the draft. Ricky Rubio actually started in the pro's there at an even younger age, and Rubio's scouting report in many cases sounds exactly like Luka's, even saying he'd be a household name."

"It wasn't a correct pick at the time, it wasn't a correct pick six months out from the draft, it's not a correct pick today, it won't be a correct pick in five yeras time - there's literally no point in history at which it was a better idea to take Deandre Ayton over Luka Doncic"
"They still have Luka Doncic, who is expected to get even better."
Bucks are a good choice. So are the Celtics. Another fun Euro star is Luka Doncic on the Mavericks. I would just pick one team or a couple players to follow and just watch as many of their games as you can this season and you'll just naturally learn about the other teams.
"I'd follow some of the upcoming young talent. Luka Doncic and Trae Young are my favorite up and comers. For older players (retired) You must check out Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson.  Rivalvry to watch: New York Knicks vs. Atlanta Hawks. Reason? TRAE YOUNG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8dji4GoBc8&amp;ab\_channel=CracksJr30"
Luka Doncic.
"Luka Doncic and Trae Young. I’d be extremely happy with either one honestly, both are very special players. It’s endlessly frustrating to think about the what-ifs of that 2018 draft."
"Do we include Hakeem?  If we are, this isn't in order but my top 10 would be: Hakeem, Giannis, Manu Ginobili, Steve Nash, Yao Ming, Pau Gasol, Nikola Jokic, Dirk Nowitzki, Toni Kukoc, and Luka Doncic."
very rough list  10 - Luka Doncic  9 - Nikola Jokic  8 - Yao Ming  7 - Pau Gasol  6 - Manu Ginobili  5 - Tony Parker  4 - Giannis Antetokounmpo  3 - Steve Nash  2 - Dirk Nowitzki  1 - Hakeem Olajuwon
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
[Katz] Luka Doncic is out of the Mavericks rotation “as of right now”.
"I've been coached by the first basketball coach Jonas Valančiūnas had. She is fucking fierce when it comes to free throws. You must consistently make 90% of them since early days for her to be satisfied. This translates into very solid fundamentals when throwing the ball, just look at how soft Valančiūnas shoots it. It was just a matter of time before we saw him extend his range.  Also, this year was the first time Lithuania failed to qualify for Olympics (thanks Luka Doncic) and a lot of critisism was directed towards our centers not throwing 3s and instead playing a 00's style of basketball. I guess Jonas took that personally."

"I'd put him over Booker. Doncic is scoring more, and although Booker is a bit more efficient, he isn't really super efficient this season anyway, at least not yet.  Scoring is basically the only thing Booker does, so yes, I'd give the nod to Luka who is scoring more and does much more on the court for his team."
"14th? That’s bad to you? Just, middle of the road for a first option?  Yeah I’m sure playing basketball did “contribute to his demise”, it’s also what he got paid for. That’s his job. He wasn’t James Harden or Luka Doncic or Nikola Jokic in this bitch."

if dallas comes back and win ill buy a luka doncic body pillow
Ask your friends who don't watch sports who Luka Doncic is.
Hot take  I’d say Luka Doncic
"lol i like giddey but let's not act like he's luka doncic my guy, he shoots terrible percentages and averages like 5 assists on a lotto team frequently playing garbage time. Im gonna laugh so hard when SGA inevitably leaves after four years of OKC skidding their wheels in the mud, enjoy luv"
"He's going to be 37 in a few weeks, short of acquiring a Luka Doncic, Devin Booker or a Trae Young, he's done winning championships if they can't turn it around this season.  They've backed themselves into a wall with a poorly assembled roster so unless he's willing to go a place like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas or Phoenix where he can be more of the Robin to someone else's Batman, I think he's done."

"""HE'S TOO FUCKING SMALL"" - Dejounte ""Luka Doncic"" Murray"
Luka “Starlord” Doncic
"If we're talking currently, Trae has been better so far this season. At this rate he'll steal the second guard spot on the All-NBA First Team from Doncic and Harden. And I think Trae is a better playmaker than Luka. But last postseason proved that the gap in their scoring is too big for me to call Trae a better player overall."
"You as the Mavs or you as the Blazers?  Brunson's not the complete scorer CJ is but he's probably a better defender and point guard.  But he's a UFA at the end of the season, and can the Mavs keep him?  And if I were GM I'd be a little worried about how much better the team seems to be playing with Brunson than Doncic these days and try to force Kidd to get better at building the team round Luka.  (Plus, packaging Brunson is a way to get rid of Hardaway Jr., who looks like he can only play well for Carlisle.)"
"I agree on basically all that. He came in highly polished with a very high floor but where can he realistically improve?    Maybe if he improves his conditioning it would help in some other areas. I agree though he won’t ever be an elite defender.   I think he could improve his shooting but I also question his work ethic and drive to do so. The fact that he has so often shown up out of shape and has yet to work to improve his shooting leaves one to wonder. People say it’s just because he takes difficult shots is why, but shouldn’t we question why he has yet to stop taking difficult shots that are poor shots?   People called him a generational player way too soon and are afraid to back track on it. Giannis and Lebron are generational players. I just don’t see it from Luka.   |Player|PPG|RPG|APG|TO|FGA|2P%|3P%|FT%|TS%|USG%| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |Doncic|25.7|8.4|7.7|4|19.2|.546|.330|.733|.570|34.4| |Player B|24.2|3.9|8.9|4.2|17.9|.489|.346|.864|.574|32|   These players also have roughly some amount of games and minutes played as well as FG attempted etc.   One of these is considered generational and the other cant make an All NBA team at all despite not much difference between them. they are also both mediocre defenders."

"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor.

"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%).

Depends.  Do I have to trade Luka Doncic for Young?
SMH does Trae have to compete with Luka over everything??? We just got this spicy hate boner going with the Knicks and Doncic is already trying to overshadow it. Can’t have anything in Atlanta

the nephew one is much better bc I actually like Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic
"I think Mavs play the Clips tonight aswell, also just coming off a loss to the Clips.   Luka probably coming back so I'm shitting bricks cause last time Kawhi-less clips faced Doncic Mavs the score was kind of really fucking bad."
Luka Doncic vs Kawhi... massive duel incoming!
[It’s been a pretty consistent report from Sam Amick regarding why the Kings let him go](https://aroyalpain.com/2020/01/16/joerger-wanted-luka-doncic/amp/). [Especially considering Sam Amick was one of the first to report Joerger and the Kings had tension in the first place](http://theathletic.com/684382/2018/11/29/behind-the-scenes-kings-tension-with-dave-joerger-is-getting-worse-by-the-day/%3famp). Just seems like something silly to be confidently wrong about
"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPZVZN-D5RE&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPZVZN-D5RE&amp;t=)  6 minutes in:     KOC: ""No Luka Doncic?""     Fox: ""...There's been critics...There's not too many foreign guys that have been stars in the league"""
Stat wise yes I agree with your last sentence .  It’s just…styles make fights and the style Luka Doncic plays right now I just don’t see multiple MVPs are GOAT
Luka had an all time floor when he came into the league. He almost beat the Kawhi Clippers in his sophomore year/3rd year. Did you see last season's series ? Doncic is pretty much unguardable. You can't double team him. He's too big and strong so wing defenders don't mean much against him. He's the clutchest young player in the league imo.   A decent/good squad around him can probably get him a lot of awards and even a chip or two. He's also 22 and already a top 10 lock in the league. The hype isn't unjustified.
I hope luka doncic never gets out the first round
It is taking Luka Doncic if he is available
Damn that’s hella sad. That’s where they messed up for decades to come. Luka was the sure fire pick leading up to the draft. Vlade even took Doncic to dinner and everything. I don’t know why he made it so complicated by picking Bagley
"The Doncic dad rumor was false, which actually makes the pick so much worse. He actually believed Bagley will be better than Luka"
"1. Luka Doncic 2. Doncic, Luka 3. Luka 4. Doncic 5. Halleluka 6. No. 77 7. The Matador 8. El Niño Maravilla"
Is the guy that drafted Marvin Bagley III over Luka Doncic still around?
"Lmao, this sub is now being accused for not stanning white players despite the fellatio over Luka doncic."
In what universe would the Kings draft Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic? It's the fucking Kings.
They could have had Luka Doncic and they fire Walton lol
"in a game where both teams missed their best players (Luka Doncic and Nicolas Batum), the Clippers gritted out a win"
luka doncic
Poor Luke became yet another Kings scapegoat. What exactly did they expect the team to perform with that crap roster they have had for years.  Maybe don’t passed on Luka Doncic would have helped a bit.
Usman Garuba was the youngest ever starter for Real Madrid. The previous holder of that record was Luka Doncic.
"Magic- Steph- Bird- Durant- Jokic   Reserves: Drexler, LaVine, Kukoc, Webber, Sabonis, Luka Doncic, McGrady 👻"
"Someone posted info from a Mike Schmitz ESPN article yesterday.    • ""Among the nine players to attempt at least 30 floaters so far, Maxey is the most efficient in the NBA, posting a 59.4 eFG%, 8% better than Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, who ranks second."""
It's a curse Will Barton/Luka Doncic/Fred Van Vleet also share. They are all good-great players but they waste 10-16 seconds of the possession needlessly dribbling meaning there is usually only 8-14 seconds left to create something and there are no opportunities to reset if things go wrong which leads to needless turnovers and bad shots. Makes me want to gouge my eyes out
"The funniest thing to me is that they are missing Kevin Porter Jr. The dude is #4.....NUMBER 4 in Turnovers Per Game in all the NBA, right between Luka Doncic and Trae Young who both have obviously earned their right to be on the list."
"As of right now the Wolves don't have an allstar. LeBron and AD will both make the allstar game, even if the Lakers are barely above .500, which will take away the possible frontcourt spot KAT could get. Guard is way too freaking deep for Edwards to make it, and as you can see from this breakdown, there will be an overflow of guards into the wildcard spots, making it so the bare mininum of 6 frontcourt players make it.   **Starters**  * Stephen Curry * Luka Doncic * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic  **Reserves**  * G - Donovan Mitchell * G - Chris Paul * F - Paul George * F - Draymond Green * F - Rudy Gobert * W - Devin Booker * W - Ja Morant"
We already had the Steph Curry era. Giannis is prob next. Likely Luka Doncic gets one too down the line
"Don't forget Rasheed Wallace, Pau Gasol, and Luka Doncic"
"Magic and Bird elevated their teams to championship contenders, pretty much *every single year*. KG padded his stats on Minnesota teams that lost in the 1st round 7 times in a row. All of the all-time greats elevated their games in the playoffs; KG never did, consistently performing worse in the playoffs year after year. I don’t care who your supporting cast is, if you’re a top 10 player, you’re willing your squad to a playoff victory. And even if you lose, you put forth a playoff performance that exceeds your regular season averages in a valiant effort to put your team over the top. Even Luka Doncic elevated his game last post-season in a way KG never did.  KG was a good defender but he was limited offensively. He was never going to be your best offensive player and if he was, you'd be out in the 1st round. He constantly was unable to elevate his game in the playoffs. He was never good at getting to the FT line and settled for mid-range jumpers way too often. He was below average from an efficiency standpoint, in 17 seasons he scored 30+ points in a playoff game just 9 times. People see that he was a 20+ PPG scorer a couple seasons and assume he was just below Dirk, Kobe or even Duncan offensively but it just isn't the case.  Not to mention that the way Taylor treats longevity is dumb. Nobody really determines greatness by adding up the win shares across every year of a career. The notion that you could somehow become the GOAT by being a bench player for 80 years is quite frankly absurd. I don't care how many seasons Duncan puts up 10ppg, none of those seasons make a dent in his case against Lebron. We really care about how good a player was in their prime (as long as that prime lasted a meaningful length of time).  You're honestly insane if you're telling me you'd pick KG over Magic and Bird to build a franchise around."
"https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/10/nba-stats-and-player-projections/  Top 10 in DRIP (excluding Kawhi)  1. Steph - +6.6  2. Jokic - +5.7 (Kawhi is tied)  T-3. LeBron - +5.1  T-3. CP3 - +5.1  5.

"Entire team's second jump speed improves 30% in a week leading to an increase in putback shots. Kings increase average scoring by 11% per game and get more defensive rebounds keeping opposing teams down a few easy buckets a game. Morale grows as they reach 5 seed by all-star break and end up the 3 seed by playoffs. They ultimately win a long series against the Mavericks when it comes down to a game 7 layup attempt over Luka Doncic. Bagley blows a layup over Doncic because of course he does. Marvin comes down just as Doncic goes up for the rebound, and then it happens  Vlade shows up with a stereo blaring ""The Final Countdown""  Doncic rises but it's too late, Marvin Bagley the Third is already springing past him from his second jump, gathering his own rebound and tipping his shot in  The basketball world erupts. Doncic is exposed as a fraud and the 2018 #2 overall draft pick has defeated the imposter and claimed his place in history. Vlade is vindicated, tears steaming down his face. Kings fans rejoice - there is nothing that can slow this momentum. Ultimate victory is within their grasp, if only they just take it.    Kings are then swept in the second round by the Portland Trailblazers led by Damian Lillard and Ben Simmons"
"As I see it, the following need to be true for someone to lay claim to the GOAT title.  * The candidate GOAT needs to come into the league and pretty much be a top-10, if not a top-5 player almost immediately.  * This candidate GOAT need to have an at-least all-NBA level prime that lasts 15 seasons, and a few more good all-star level seasons.  * The candidate GOAT need to have a peak of at least 6 or 7 seasons where he is clearly the best player in the league and at least 10 seasons where he is at least a top 5 player.  * This GOAT could miss one season in his prime for whatever reason, at most. Coupled with playoff success, this usually means unprecedented good health for 15+ years.  * If the GOAT is neither MJ or LeBron, then they will either need to win at least 6 championships to beat MJ or top LeBron's cumulative playoff records. (LeBron leads in points scored and steals, he's 2nd in assists, and 6th in total rebounds. Also, his streak of making consecutive NBA Finals/Semifinals.)  * This GOAT would also likely be a member of one or multiple league-defining dynasties (multiple championship wins in quick succession) or super-teams (legendary named team), such as the Heatles, Warriors dynasty, Bulls dynasty, Lakers dynasty, Spurs general success, etc.  * The GOAT has to be able to push such a narrative, meaning they have the general media's and fan's respect. Obviously, not everyone will like them, but as long as enough people argue for their GOAT candidacy, the conversation will work itself out.  At the moment, the only active player who qualifies all of these is LeBron. Giannis ascended to superstardom in 2016-2017, his fourth season in the NBA. He would need another 10 dominant seasons, the last of which would happen when he's 36 or 37. Could that happen? Sure. Will it happen? Highly unlikely. He's still need to win a few more championships, not get injured for the whole decade, and turn in dominant season after dominant season.  The only other player who has a body of work we can point to that could satisfy these could be Luka Doncic. However, he's still got a long ways to go and extrapolating out that far is treacherous.  Zion had the potential by being amazing right off the bat, but the Pelicans aren't yet a winning team, and who knows what's going to happen for him now."
"Luka Doncic, win a ring before age 25 and consistently put up his usual statline with slightly better efficiency on ramping defense every year"
Well unless Facundo Campazzo is really Luka Doncic I think the Nuggets played a little outside themselves tonight. Nuggets should be great but the Bulls are really good too.
"Ok, CP3 stan.  If that was true, and he wasn't never actually good, he would have been good with Luka Doncic, James Harden, LeBron James, and Russell Westbrook, all of whom are excellent playmakers"

Luka Doncic won't hit all-time great levels unless he drastically changes his lifestyle habits
I did the same joke a while back with Luka Doncic and Paige Bueckers and man was I downvoted to hell
"True. I wouldn't have picked him to go with Giannis as this list's ""Shaq-selections"".  I would've rather had Jokic or Doncic, based on current individual achievements &amp; future projections. Jokic has achieved much more than AD &amp; Luka has multi-MVP potential."
"best mid range shooter in the Chinese league, maybe. He cut down on his inefficient 3s but he still wasn't a good shooter. You've got to be smoking premium crack to say that Westbrook was the best point guard in the league that season/bubble. Same bubble that Had Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Jamal Murray, Chris Paul..."
"I don’t see the argument for regular season AD being better than:   Giannis, Jokic, KD, Steph, Kawhi, LeBron, Harden, Embiid, CP3, PG, Jimmy Butler, Dame, and the Luka Doncic that existed before Jason Kidd was hired.   However in the playoffs, I’ll take him over half of that list easily."
"You keep saying that. It was a joke on the Nuggets subreddit which you frequent consistently like the clown you are. I also said Doncic is a ""whiny bitch"" yesterday in the Nuggets forum, does that mean I hate Luka?"
"Could be worse. You could have hired the Slovenian national team coach and then NOT pick Luka Doncic, effectively making the hiring pointless."

Sure, but it would be like arguing for bagley over doncic after their rookie season. Bagley could have ended up better than luka, but it was unlikely at that point.   And I don't get the poole thing. What team doesn't want multiple point guards that can shoot? Lamelo's passing/iq/shooting makes him fit perfectly with the warriors.

J.Green and Iwundu played for total 48 minutes at SF position with total of 0/3 fg.  J.Powell was bad at defense and not much of a factor on offense either.  I dont think Mavs supporting cast is underrated. Its just Rick Carlisle’s magic to get 100% from those players. He created his new JJ Barea from Burke. I ve followed most of Hardaway Jr’s career and he looked lost most of the time. Having Doncic leading the offense is helping him a lot. Double teams and traps on Luka let open shots for Thj/Burke duo in this game. So I wouldnt say there were a supporting cast underrated.  Its just a supporting cast used with 100% efficiency with Carlisle coaching and Luka’s offense.

Trae gets himself into conversation when someone praise Doncic like if he is in same group with Luka. His fans always compare him with Luka after Luka having a subpar game. Trae is as toxic as it gets
Really traded Luka Doncic for this bum and poor man's Patrick Williams /s    What's wrong with Trae :( He was so good just last year ...
They are now saying it was Luka Doncic.
I was told Trae Young was better than Luka Doncic.      Your apology needs to be as loud as your disrespect was.

"So? The only team Luka played was the Clippers, and he put up godly numbers. Led both teams in scoring and assists, 0.4 rebounds/game away from leading that category as well, as a guard. They win that series too with KP, and they get swept without Luka.   I'm not saying Doncic is better based on the playoffs, but there is certainly a case for him."
"What stats? That Luka is 70% at the rim and Steph is 69.7? How is that making him far better? Is he defended the same, is one season enough of sample size, did he played the same teams and opponents?  Steph Curry has lead the best team of all time in any possible metric you can think of. Luka has all the potential in the world but he hasn't done it yet. ""Been there"" trumps potential everytime.  Also what stat suggested that Luka is a better defender? Steph is net positive at almost any defensive stat and he passes the eye test even when teams target him constanly on defense= Luka has one season on a playoff team.  Also Luka having 9 assists and Steph having 8.7 proves what exactly? Have you watched how the Warriors are playing? Draymond said it recently ""everything is possible because of Steph and his gravity"". What is the purpose behind the ""assist"" metric as an idea, something that measures how you help your teammates to score. Do you trully belive that Luka Doncic is providing more to his teammates than Steph Curry? Someday Luka may be in the same ballpark but until then just watch him and enjoy the show,"
"Doncic  1- It’s pretty insane but this guy is 21 years old.   2- Prt of Jokic’s prime is aligned with the Lakers potential dynasty....and despite all the jokes and last years playoffs, maybe even a clipper title or two  2b- The Lakers could win 2 more titles, Clippers win 2, 2 eastern conference teams win, and poof theres 6 years and Jokic’s prime. Luka would be **27**. And that’d be when bron, Kawhi, KD, Steph, even AD would be retired or no longer elite and Luka would be **27**  2c- Jokic’s prime will be over faster bc he’s an immobile big.   3- Jokic’s hopes are locked in with Denver’s current team, or at the very minimum Murray and MPJ. This isn’t a bad thing overall, but in this instance it gives Luka an edge bc not only does Dallas have a pathway to add a 3rd star, he has a pathway that it Porzinigis doesn’t work they can bring in TWO other stars"
"&gt; And look who you're comparing him to. If he's on the same path as those guys he is on a goat level trajectory.  That's exactly my point lol. He's not on the path as those guys were initially. Doncic is behind. Those guys immediately came into the league and were top 5 players. Doncic has taken a few years to do so, and is on the fringe of top 5 right now.  It's simply too early to say some like ""He's on path to GOAT"". He needs to be consistently taking his team deep in the playoffs, winning MVPs, DPOYs, All-NBA First Nods, All-Defense First nods etc...... to be in that conversation.  For example, Giannis is closer to be ""on the path to GOAT"" than Luka because of his ridiculous success in the last few years; though even Giannis' one big knock is that he's been underwhelming in the playoffs in the last two seasons.  Let's wait till Luka is like ..... 25-26 years old and see where he's at. As of now, he's barely played for 2 seasons (with a shortened 2020); it's simply too early."

"Okay link them. Here's the actual stats, though.  Luka Doncic 10-16 ft - 46%   Luka Doncic 16-3pt - 67%  Joel Embiid 10-16 ft - 44%  Joel Embiid 16-3pt - 63%"
"I actually saw Luka Doncic at a Walmart in Dallas yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to drive out the doors on his scooter with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter breathing heavily.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
"1. Curry and Durant didn’t play last season   2. You would rather have Embiid and Jokic over Doncic? What planet are you living on? Basketball not your main sport  3. Jordan was 1-9 without Scottie pippen his first few years, Duncan, bird and magic all had hall of famers hints why they had immediate playoff success. Luka had Porzingus but he was injured in the first few playoff games. Luka still carried the Mavs to 6 while playing Injured and average 31 9 and 8. Vs the stacked clippers    Gtfo"
"Idk why, just can't seem to get Luka ""Donkey Dick"" Doncic to catch on. /s"
"The first 5 games when Hawks fans were all like “Trae + Reddish &gt; Doncic!” was amusing. Reality check: Luka is a) a beast, b) destined to be the face of the league."

There's other links as well but I don't need to find them. One post on here broke down his clutch numbers really well. It's showed he was absolutely abysmal in crunch time.

Unless you mean their respective passing skills, which again I can't argue against. But as a whole? Luka has to either improve his   shooting (more consistent) or defense to be leading teams to 60 wins. I don't think that anyone has Luka above Giannis (as of current) apart from his die hard fans."

Doncic and Simmons both got that LeBronesque playmaking but he’s a much better fit next to Simmons cause of his defense. Likewise J Rich is a better fit next to Luka.
Lamelo Ball out played Trae Young and Luka Doncic in the same season seems like both teams lost the trade
"agreed.  i know they wanted to bolster the defense but i dont think curry for jrich was the right decision to make.  currys offense has constantly improved, and he can even do some nice stuff off the dribble now.  i dont think they should have given away an all-time great shooter on a team with luka fucking doncic."
See: Luka Doncic game 4
"Well since i dont want to say the same names that are already said here i think that Luka is one of the best guards in the post.   In his first six games this season, Dončić is posting up on 9.2% of his possessions, generating an absurd 1.33 points per possession. It’s a small sample size (only 15 possessions), but for comparison, the Mavericks are generating 1.14 points per possession in transition. Even more, Dončić leads the league by generating free throws on 46.7% of his post-ups. It seems like Dončić either scores, gets fouled, or both when he is in the post this season.

Imagine the Raptors get Cade Cunningham.   Luka Doncic all over again
I read Cades draft portfolio and an offensively worse luka doncic (still excellent) with a better shot and better defence. yea i wouldnt mind that
"Luka is a good 3pt shooter, he just takes really fucking shit shots (step-back 3s with 19 seconds on the clock etc.). He is difficult to defend because when he isn't fixated on chucking up step-back 3s, he is a very high IQ player who will punish the defense with what they give him  Doncic can take it to the rack, abuse smaller defenders in the post, pull up jumpers off the pick&amp;roll (both 3 and mid-range), floaters, whatever. And when the defense collapses on him, he will pick them apart with his passing."
"If Luka Doncic is a point guard, so is Harden  The Rockets effectively play him like a point guard anyway, he's the main ball-handler"
Luka “no playoff series wins” Doncic
The amount of underestimation of European players in the NBA is unprecedented. Only Luka Doncic is not underestimated because he is a golden boy for making money. Literally all other European players are underestimated. From Jokic to Vucevic etc. They all rank lower than the true values.
Luka Doncic will gradually build up pressure.  It's scary considering the performance he's already giving us.  An MVP title is playable this year for him if Dallas performs well.
"Damn that Luka Doncic,will surely surpass Luca Doncic and maybe ever the G.O.A.T Luka Doncic."
I’ll take the 1999 special luka doncic
"Their team record is very similar, even though the Mavs have one of the hardest schedules and the Hawks have one of the easiest.  They're actually shooting nearly identically from the field, even though Doncic is only shooting 20 percent from three.  Give Doncic an extra 4 free throws a game, and I'm sure he'd have the same PPG.  Luka is also a much better defender."

"&gt; The number of long rebounds due to three point shots has expanded the need for guards who can rebound, not bigs.  I am sure you know how to look this stat up but look how much a guard that gets a lot of rebounding improves their teams rebounding like Russel Westbrook and Luka Doncic than look at a bigman who is a good rebounding center does. Guard rebounding has zero correlation with winning.  &gt;I'd love to see the stats that show us being significantly worse on defense, any and every number I've seen has us being better, as does the eye test.  Last year Jaren Jackson Jr actually made the Grizzlies worse on defense and on offense whenever [he was on the court](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4439/onoff#tab-team_efficiency). He made the defense pretty significantly worse at a rate of 2.5 more points per 100 possession, good for bottom third in the NBA.  &gt;Look, we aren't going to see eye to eye. You clearly don't value Jaren and that is fine.  Agreed, I'll stop now."

"Must say, Mavs missing a few key players aside, the Raptors really did a good job of locking down Luka Doncic tonight."
Honestly I don’t see how you could call anybody an MVP candidate so far that’s name isn’t Luka Doncic.
"Pretty funny that Doncic is the best defender on the Mavs right now. Just waiting for prime, jacked 24-28 year old Luka lol."
"along with all his other skills, Luka Doncic is an *elite* offensive rebounder"
"Remember when people claimed Trae would be an equal when he started out hot the first few games? This sub will never learn lol. Trae's going to be a great player but Luka is special. I hope he stays healthy because there's some serious all-time great potential here, like, All-NBA first team among HoF players potential.   2.1 defensive BPM is All-Defense level impact if he can keep it up. I predict that his per game stats will eventually drop a bit in the next few years but only because Luka will learn to pick his spots and play even better winning basketball, kinda like Bron post 2009 when he reached his per game peak but dominated his peers more and more every year.   The league will be in great hands if Doncic doesn't suffer bad injuries. He's a basketball savant already imo and I've been defending him ever since his euro days. I'm european so I got to watch a lot of his game before his NBA debut and he was clearly the smartest and most skilled player even then already on any given night."
"I know I'm going out on a limb here, but I think this Luka Doncic guy is pretty good at basketball."
Lmao I hope this keeps going until the whole thing becomes a messy rabbit hole of something something Luka Doncic Luka Doncic Luka Doncic.

"No one hates the Kings, it's just y'all are a small market team in the western conference that hasn't made the playoffs in a really long time. The NBA wants to flaunt and advertise its best players and best teams since this is what people crave.   A lot of people know about Devin Booker or Luka Doncic, not so many know about Buddy Hield or Marvin Bagley, and so it's in the NBA's best interest to advertise those teams"
"When Luka matures as a player, he'll be like Doncic."
"I don't know, is Larry Bird a low ceiling for Luka Doncic?   /s  Zion would be blessed to have the career of Giannis."

"Shiit, even a basketball executive born in Europe and well aware of the Euroleague thought Marvin Bagley III was a better pick than Luka Doncic"
"As I’ve already noted, they were ranked consistently #2 or #1 in the power rankings for the entire season   for example:  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28154384/nba-power-rankings-week-6-lakers-bucks-nuggets-rolling-here-comes-luka-doncic  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28204180/nba-power-rankings-week-7-luka-doncic-heroics-lead-new-no-1-watch-champs"
Kinda butthurt that Jokic couldn't get one more assist and Rebound so that the Doncic Club can finally shut up about Luka being the only guy who has 30/15/10 games.
Okay? He’s still a very effective player. He’s not Luka Doncic but he’s also played less than 40 games and is one of the most proficient scorers at his age in history
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
😂 Your lack of an argument and redundant nature of your post shows you’re using emotion not logic. ‘Literally false’ tf does that even mean? He’s shooting 26% from 3 on the year. And—-wait why should you hear it from me let Luka tell you!  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30731793/dallas-mavericks-star-luka-doncic-triple-double-loss-was-being-selfish  That’s *literally* him.
Luka “despite the loss” doncic
Luka &gt; Doncic
I wasn't expecting Luka 'Bradley Beal' Doncic this early in the season
"If he will be teaming up with Luka Doncic, Cade and Emoni Bates he would still be playin at 46 for sure."
"Because that's his exact statline.  If you make it 30-5-5, more people qualify rather than those 2 other superstars.  If you upped any of them by 1 (31 points for Harden or 6/7 assists for Iverson), Doncic no longer qualifies.  For the record, insane first half for Luka.  He's struggled from 3 this year, but he caught fire and made his team competitive before halftime.  I more just am stating WHY they have to have that exact statline."

But the issue is more nuanced than it seems—a byproduct of  Doncic’s role in Dallas’s offense is that he often takes incredibly  difficult 3-pointers.*  *The league as a whole shot 35.8 percent from distance  last season, but not all 3-point attempts are created equal. Wide-open  3s (defined by NBA.com/Stats as shots with the closest defender more  than 6 feet away) are easier than more closely guarded attempts.  Catch-and-shoot 3s are easier than pull-up attempts. And 3s from the  short corners are easier than above-the-break attempts.*   *Yet out of 189 players who attempted at least 150 3-pointers last season, Doncic ranked:*  &amp;#x200B;  * *186th in the proportion of his 3-point attempts that were wide open;* * *188th in the proportion that were catch-and-shoot attempts;* * *189th, absolute last, in the proportion that came from the corners.*  *In other words, Luka rarely had the opportunity for an easy 3, which explains a bit of his accuracy lag.*"

Chicago Bulls vs Luka Doncic   What a great game
&gt; It's 2021 and people still think you can judge a shooter's skill by their 3P%  translation: I want to believe that Luka Doncic is a good shooter
Luka Doncic is the truth
"He's not a great shooter, but [he outperforms his expected 3 point percentage](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/7/22217827/luka-doncic-3-point-shooting-mvp) on huge volume. That's hard to do."
&gt;  sees Luka as a young version of himself  I hadn't heard that. They play so differently. Doncic is a far better ball handler and passer than Pierce ever was but Pierce is a much better outside shooter.
Luka Doncic?

James Johnson and Luka Doncic
We just saw Shaq. It's not that uncommon. What if Giannis or Luka Doncic or someone get better and start winning championships.
Yes the great 41/33/69 shooting splits while luka averaged 43/33/71 with double the volume  Ball with: eFG .467  Doncic with: eFG .497
"The sheer number of talented, productive guards in the West right now is insane. Understanding that SGA is the clear alpha on a team tanking (well, supposed to be tanking LOL), you have production lines that are right up there with the guys most would have penciled in to be All Stars at the start of the season.   Unless I missed a change to All Star lineups, at MOST the West can name 6 backcourt players to the roster. It's going to be a travesty that a minimum of THREE of these guys are going to be snubbed this year:  Steph Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Devin Booker Chris Paul Donovan Mitchell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander CJ McCollum Mike Conley"
If they are shooting like this and dropping 25+ ppg i dont see how one of them isn't in the MVP discussion. They are winning and on AMAZING numbers.   Dont see how Luka is ahead when hes shooting 46/25/85 and with a worse record tbh. Doncic is on some westbrook MVP season except playing worse.
Luka Doncic is the poor man's Sam Merrill

Maybe ya'll will get a Luka Doncic type player.
"And Luka was 1/6 from 3, 3/7 from FT. Can't believe Giannis is shooting better than Doncic from 3 this season. They also had a similar 3P% last season"
Everyone except Oubre is shooting higher than Luka Doncic from beyond the arc.
"I’ll sum them up for you. They have Luka Doncic who is already reaching superstar level. They also have his other teammate, Kristaps Porzingis. Both are good. Rest of the team is good and they have a chance at proving themselves in the playoffs."
"Watch Luka Doncic Play, it’s very entertaining everytime he gets on that court then, you’ll enjoy the game more 🙏🏼"
Jokic has never gotten the respect he deserves. He was a great starter for a couple of years and literally no announcers other than our own knew how to pronounce his name. They all called him (joke-itch) or jockich. Even after he became an all star some of them still didn’t learn his name. A lot of them to this day will just call him joker all the time. It’s really sad. Players on small market teams get no love. Some thing happened to Giannis until he was the mvp. But everybody and their mom knew how to pronounce Luka Doncic
Eh it's a pretty deep draft but there really isn't anyone putting up numbers like Luka Doncic or Ja Morant or Ben Simmons or KAT so far.   Out of the past 5 years I think this is probably the 2nd weakest top end behind 2016-17. That said I think some guys like Wiseman and Deni play a type of game that will look a lot better when they're a few years older.
Luka Doncic dropped 43 in the playoffs vs clippers along with 17 rebounds and 13 assists.
"This kind of thing obviously exists everywhere. But we also happen to be on an nba sub, not a Bayern Munich one lol. It’s just that Luka and Giannis are top tier superstars and still getting this treatment.   Davies is still admittedly young and honestly I can understand the confusion since there is generally one pronunciation that is used by most people for his surname that happens to not be the case for him. People incapable of saying Antetekounmpo or Doncic aren’t doing so because they are unaware, but because they just don’t care."
"Well that's what I am talking about, maybe Doncic wins multiple rings, maybe something else happens and another superstar comes along and blocks him from winning it or whatever. Pierce *is* a finals MVP and I'd wait for at least a couple of more years before proclaiming Luka better than Pierce. Not to mention that Pierce's scoring numbers (especially in the era he played) were elite."
"I think without a doubt that Doncic has a significantly better skill set than Paul pierce. In his first two years, Luke has averaged less minutes that Paul pierce but more points, rebounds, assists. In his third year doncic is in route to do the same thing. Paul pierce was a better shooter than doncic, and definitely a better defender but not necessarily a better scorer or better player.   I’m not saying Luka is definitively better than Paul pierce, but in a few years if Luka keeps trending how he is, I don’t think it will even be an argument"
 Giannis Antetokounmpo  &gt; An-teto-kum-po  Luka Doncic  &gt; Don-chich  I know this isn't exactly perfect pronunciation but atleast am not slaughtering it. And yes I had to look up Antetokounmpo's spelling but pronunciation is not that hard. They just lazy.
"But what you’re saying is that Paul Pierce (the originator of the “I can’t win a chip alone, I need a big 3) and Andre Iguodala (a great defensive player and decent 6th man, but only 1 time all-star) are on the same level...and that level is ABOVE Luka Doncic who is an MVP candidate and without a doubt the best young player in the league?? Do you even watch basketball?"
Luka is way more efficient within the 3 pt line than pierce. However pierce is currently the superior 3 pt shooter however doncic takes more difficult 3s on more volume than pierce ever did
"Doncic competed against lebron for all nba first team in the small forward position? interesting, I was not aware that Luka won all nba first team in the forward position, thank you for providing me with this new information. One day you think a player is a point guard, and the next day you learn hes better a small forward this whole time, damn aint life crazy."
There's 2 first team spots and when Pierce was at his peak from 02-05 LeBron wasn't first team yet. It was Duncan and KG taking his spots.   Either way there's no argument for Pierce over Doncic but the truth is Pierce was only comparing his scoring game to Luka which is actually a fair comparison. He mentioned Luka being a better passer but everyone overlooked that.
"Yeah, and it's not even like anyone expects it to be a perfect accent on a tough name. Just say ""Yawnis"" and ""Donchich."" Not that tough to be good enough. Or if you seriously can't manage Doncic, just say Luka."
Luka Doncic is maaaaad.
AD and in the future if he keeps preforming well Luka Doncic for sure
Not yet. But Luka Doncic clearly has the potential to be at least as good as James Harden. That says a lot about Doncic's potential.
Is Luka Doncic the greatest player ever
Luka Doncic.... Definitely had a pregame meal
Trae should laugh. These guys are no where near as talented as him. It’s like someone asking Luka Doncic to cool it. Ridiculous.

&gt;one of Luka and Doncic
"Lebron has such a good narrative and he is clearly the Lakers best player early this season, but the problem for him is, that Luka's narrative as a 3rd seed would just as good and when his numbers are clearly better, he will probably run away with it.   The NBA world knows that they will need a passing of the torch within the next few years and Luka is a few hundred hours with Rosetta Stone away from being a great candidate for that.  Doncic or Giannis are the best regular season players and the rewards for the post-season are FMVP and a ring, so that not that many people would feel bad for James not getting the MVP."
"Another reason Luka is different from Harden, who would have dunked it and it wouldn't have counted, smart play by Doncic."
"Luka ""The Glove 2.0"" Doncic"
Luka Doncic is good at defense. Words you thought you’d never hear.
"Guys, I think this Luka Doncic guy might be good at the Basketball"
he James Harden and Luka Doncic Venn diagram is starting to become a circle.
If the Celtics traded Marcus Smart for Luka Doncic their defense would decline too. Doesn’t mean its not a good trade lol
"In the season opener they actually put PJ on Dame Lillard for a couple of key poss at the end of the 4th and OT. Last poss [of that game he looks pretty good on here doing it](https://go.nba.com/hl3q).   Hou has asked him to play as a big the last 2 years but in 2019 googling his matchup tab here are the guys he spent the most time guarding: Paul George, LeBron, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard. If you go down youll see him having games of guarding 2's like Victor Oladipo, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine etc for 8-10 poss a game they really had him do it 2-5.  His best matchups are probably 3s and 4s. Every one of those wings I mentioned above I would trust to put on him unless he were to suddenly start showing his age over night."
"Funny thing this looks like a Luka Doncic stat line, I was surprised when I didn't see his name on the list, he'll get there soon enough"
"I feel like it is  a TIIIIINY bit like with Luka Doncic. LaMelo played well in international leagues at a quite young age. The only thing he didnt have going for him was the shooting % which is fixable. Also, even if he is half decent he is a 6'8 PG. You would be stupid not to pick him imo."

"No goal posts moved...Trae will never win MVP or ever be considered a generational talent like Luka because he's one dimensional and clearly the NBA agrees (third team all NBA last year while Luka was first and 4th in MVP votes..gonna always remind you cause you're bias is showing and its funny)  Elite scoring, passing, middle of the road defense and elite rebounding is better than being a one dimensional scorer.  Luka averaged 9.3 rebounds per game last season. That was 18th in the NBA. His 8.0 defensive rebounds a night ranked tenth. Doncic, LeBron James, and Russell Westbrook are the only three players classified as guards by Basketball-Reference that finished inside the top 25.  Luka also averaged 1.1 steals per game for the second straight season.The advanced metrics are favorable too. Doncic was 44th in NBA in defensive win shares at 2.3. Defensive box score plus-minus had him 41st.  He's a far better defender, far better player and arguing without any stats is just silly.  At least Hawks fans will get a ton of high scoring games. Sucks they won't get to see the playoffs any...but hey, thats what happens with almost every atlanta team...right?"
"No way hes broken records? Luka probably hasn't done that yet....wait a sec...https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2020-records-set-and-broken-by-luka-doncic-in-his-debut-postseason/1t8uozjw6e6hk1kso02gbin18j  That's weird... It looks like Luka won RotY over Trae and...was fourth in MVP voting last year...Wasn't it just his second season? Oh yeah...He's still better than Trae. :)  Guess he's doing good for being just some ""fat kid""."

"James Harden, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid are probably the names that come to my mind as far as having an arsenal of repeatable moves. there are other skilled players like Curry, LeMelo etc but they are skilled in a morr free flowing way as apposed to a set of moves that they stick to."

G- Luka Doncic   G- Stephen Curry   F- LeBron James   F- Anthony Davis[INJ]  F- Nikola Jokic   Bench:  G- Damian Lillard   G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard   F- Paul George   F- Rudy Gobert  WC- Devin Booker   WC- Chris Paul  INJ-REP- Zion Williamson  The only player whom I think would miss out would be DeMar DeRozan
The only thing going in Trae Young’s favor is that he is an American. This is the only reason why casuals are fanboying instead of the obvious better player in Luka Doncic. Give Luka the same roster as Trae and they would have been in the playoffs. Losing Seth in exchange for that crappy player from the Sixers was a bad move on the Mavs part.
Why is the picture for this thread of Luka doncic
Luka “fuck the percentages” doncic
"luka ""giannis"" doncic"
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Luka Doncic 12. Paul George 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Yeah I know I know Joker too high..... stay sleep man.
Mark Jackson with his usual bullshit commentary.   “lUkA”  Come on dude Luka Doncic ain’t even quick he’s just crafty
"I wasn't the one comparing him to Zion. I don't think Zion is in the running for best start of career.  &gt; Luka gets a lot of his boards himself.  He has high uncontested rebounding just like any other guard or backcourt player. &gt;75% of his boards aren't even contested.  &gt;However you can’t get multiple 20 rebound games from just “Russell Westbrook” style rebounds.  Russel Westbrook has had high rebounding games as well. Russel Westbrook, Lebron James, Luka Doncic and pretty much any high rebounding backcourt player all pretty much have uncontested rebounding rate in the 70's or low 80's most years."
1. Steph Curry  2. Luka Doncic  3. Damian Lillard  4. Chris Paul  5. Kyrie Irving  6. Ben Simmons  7. Kyle Lowry  8. Trae Young  9. De'Aaron Fox  10. Russell Westbrook
"&gt; Ya Rookie Doncic is better than prime Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Magic Johnson, John Stockton, and Chris Paul.   Yeah I didn't say that bud, nice try though.  &gt; My rebounding comment isn't even controversial. The NBA tracks uncontested vs contested rebounding. Luka literally has &gt;75% uncontested rebounds this year.   Lebron has a &gt;80% contested rebound rate this year."
"I think Luka Doncic is a bit overrated. He is routinely talked about as having top ten of all time potential. There are people who say he’s the best young player since LeBron. Now he gets voted in to All Star ahead of Lillard, whose team is 18-11 while the Mavs are below.500"
"When someone in 2040 looks at bball reference, it sure as hell ain’t gonna say “Luka Doncic, 18x Allstar **Starter**”"
Luka Doncic is better than Damian Lillard.
lmao you literally compared who was more overrated in your original stance:   &gt; Devin Booker isn't overrated this sub. The most overrated player this sub is Luka Doncic by far but Beal isn't nearly as overrated as Luka yet.  fuck outta here acting like a victim.
Devin Booker isn't overrated this sub. That is Luka Doncic.
Luka Doncic + Nets picks
so basically... luka doncic
"They're definitely different players and Larry is top 5 ever but Bird wasn't the ""anti Doncic"". Luka is an amazing player in his own right. And it goes beyond them being white.  Luka has a penchant for magical moments and has amazing vision in the same way Larry had."
People try to compare Luka to Bird and this story proves that’s only because they’re both white. Bird was the Anti-Doncic.
"Myles is actually still pretty good when he gets switched onto someone. I've seen him lock Xian Down luka doncic on multiple plays in a single game.  This is just a hyperbole to emphasise my point,  I've seen him lock down lots of great players"
"He wouldn't it's not that clear cut, he's not even leading the betting odds       LeBron James +180  Joel Embiid +450  Nikola Jokic +500  Luka Doncic +1000  Giannis Antetokounmpo +1200  Steph Curry +1200  Kevin Durant +1400  Damian Lillard +2500  Kawhi Leonard +4000  Donovan Mitchell +6600"
"Thank you, u/Llewellynjean. As always, excellent OC.  My main take: Lillard vs. Doncic was a very tight contest, with fans helping Luka. I was a Luka supporter, but I see the case for Dame"
"lmao no, Luka wasn’t drafted higher because teams used prior examples of euro league players unfairly to hurt his stock (also a mix of the kings just being dumb). If people truly thought the NCAA was better than the Euroleague then Trae would have went above Doncic too. Nobody had seen a player like Doncic before so comparing him to past Euroleague players wasn’t fair to him."
"nah. this is probably unpopular opinion but i disagree with restricting 3 points resulted in better product. the reason why nba players chucking threes and jump shooting because it's the easiest way to score. eliminating 3 point line will not change anything but the amount of scores on every shot. a player like joe harris isn't gonna drives more into the lane because three point line gone. they will shot at the places that formerly known as outside of three point line because it's where he's most comfortable for scoring and luka doncic definitely will pass to open shooter if the defense is collapsing, regardless the existence of three point line  if they really want to fix the products, fix the officiating. stop calling fouls on obvious foul baiting and get better at identifying flops and let the game flow more and be more stream friendly. nba international rating is soaring right now because league pass is at reasonable price and quality therefore the game is more accessible than ever and more people will watch meanwhile nba still clinging to cable and blackouts which limit the amount games americans can watch."
"&gt;Should I not have posted in their sub? Yeah probably.  I agree.  &gt;Did I try and shit on Doncic?  I didn't accuse you of doing that.   &gt;One, I didn't do that.  Unless I've been misusing ""shafted"" for over a decade you are explaining precisely why Dame should have won over Luka in the comment that was linked. I will agree that I could have worded that better to avoid suggesting your intention on going to the sub was to argue, but those are your actions regardless of the intention:  &gt;But this year, despite all the injuries, blazers are still winning, the mavs are below .500 and yet [Dame] STILL gets shafted. It's never-ending."

"Luka ""Despite the Loss"" Doncic"
Nets best 5 are all shooting 50% fg and 40%. Mavs are the worst 3 pt shooting team in the league. Kyrie is playing on easy mode and is only scoring better than doncic. Luka is still the far better playmaker.
He got them too lol. There was a whole effort on twitter by most European basketball fans to get those two in which is why they lead in allstar votes in 2018/2019 season. Again stop talking about what you dont know.  https://www.eurohoops.net/en/nba-news/995429/luka-doncic-and-giannis-antetokounmpo-lead-the-all-star-game-voting/  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/2/1/16955304/nba-all-star-bucks-social-media-strategy-giannis-antetokounmpo
I wonder what the default name is when referring to a player?  Doncic vs Luka?  Porzingis vs Kristaps?  Jokic vs Nikola  Ibaka vs Serge  \#28 vs Aerial Powers :O)
"*The following is a transcript of a call made between Nikola Jokic and Luca Doncic when the news broke*  Helo Luka  Helo Nikola  We wil play on basket ballteam together  Yes, I'm am egzited"
How can you call me a crybaby when your favorite NBA star is Luka Doncic? Literally the biggest bitch in the game
Shaq may not think that Luka deserves it over Lillard. Has he heard about Doncic though?
"Tbh the part I have the most problem with is the difference between last year and this year.  So, last season Dame had a career year.  Doncic obviously was incredible and took an unbelievable leap.  But the argument then was that the Mavs were a playoff team, while the Blazers were not (we were injury riddled with a bad roster in hindsight).  Fine, give it to the other incredible player with a good record.  This season, both are again having incredible seasons.  Both as good as they've ever been.  But then the goalposts swapped.  Luka is getting the start, despite being outside the playoffs looking in.  His team (due to injuries, COVID protocols, and underperformance) has let him down, while the Blazers just took 4th place.  So imo it seems like they swapped places, but Luka started both times.  It's really not fair imo."
In response to point A:  Top Selling NBA Jerseys (Jan 2020-Oct 2020)  1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. LeBron James 4. Steph Curry 5. Kevin Durant 6. Anthony Davis 7. Jayson Tatum 8.

Luka “pussy crusher” Doncic?
"The great Luka Doncic moving mountains and has his team...10th in the West. Put the team on your back for a change, son.  Embarrassing!"
"It’s like a slight differentiation.  Theoretically the 5 best players start at their position.  In this case, Steph Curry, Damien Lillard, and Luka Doncic were far and away the best three guards, with Dame and Luka being close statistically for the second best guard.  So by narrowly getting the starting spot ahead of Dame, voters are saying that Luka is better, even if slightly (or at least having a better year). This is controversial because Dallas has lost a bunch of games and Portland hasn’t, even though they both have had injuries.  I think people underestimate how badly Dallas missed its players but inarguably Dallas has not won at the rate that Portland has with its missed players.  Dame had had some late game winning theatrics and Dallas has struggled in the clutch, if not specifically Luka.  All this contributes to people thinking Dame should have made it to the starting role over Luka.  It’s basically a toss up but I see the argument for Dame as a strong one.  Luka leads in most of the advanced metrics (statistics like 538’s raptor WAR; and basketball-reference’s VORP, but Dame is very close to Luka in all of these and has had more big moments in wins.  Recently they played each other and Dame hit a big go-ahead three and Luka missed a wide open three to tie.  There’s no wrong answer here and coaches and media types came up with a tie vote on who should start so the Dan vote broke the tie, and Luka is immensely popular in a much bigger market in Dallas and has Much of the European vote so he won the fans.  Long post but if you stuck it out you now know why people are upset on here."
Luka Doncic
"Yeah, the problem with the Mavericks is not Luka Doncic. I’m a Mavs fan and I’d probably say Dame deserved to start, but anyone saying this is an outrageous snub is stupid. It’s very tight between them"
Los Mavericks numero one star Senor Luka Doncic.
I voted for Luka Doncic over Dame Lillard.
All my homies hate Luka Doncic
&gt; so the players and media all thought dame should start but  &gt; Damian Lillard and Luka Doncic were tied in votes  ?
Luka Doncic looks like a 9/11 employee
"hello, if you support manchester united, the nets would probably be the team you want to support if you want a win now team. if you want to enjoy the journey of a young team becoming contenders potentially, grizzlies or pelicans are the teams you gotta support. Grizzlies has 2 young prospects and future all stars in JJJ and Ja Morant. Pelicans has Zion and Ingram, with Zion being one of the best young talents in the game. You can compare Zion to Ansu Fati from Barcelona, a player who only started playing last season ( both of them ) and started dominating.  There’s also Mavericks, with 2 europeans in Porzingis and Luka Doncic, Doncic is already one of the best players, you can compare him to how Haaland already has been a big player."
The worst part is the NBA forced the Kings to draft Marvin Bagley so that Luka Doncic can eventually end up in a big market. NBA really do be corrupt like that.
"False Equivalency.  There's only 6 guard spots in All NBA selections if the offensive numbers are close to equal then defense has to be a deciding factor as well as win totals  the years WB made All NBA he was averaging 25+ pts, 8+ Reb and 8+ assists on teams that were the 6th seed and up  Kyrie has only made one 2nd team allnba and one 3rd, in 2015 he was third team all nba with similar stats to Lavine this year except he was on a 53 win team and his 2nd all nba placement was 2019 where he avgd 24/7/5 on a 49 win team  Again there are 6 guard spots in the All NBA  who of this list is Zach Lavine Replacing?  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic  Dame Lillard  James Harden  Lebron James (yes he's a guard now)  Donnovan Mitchell  Bradley Beal   I just listed 7 guards above Lavine just incase you wanted to die on the Lebron hill  that's not even arguing he should squeak in as the last spot on the 3rd team  the dude I responded to actually said 2ND TEAM ALL NBA as in he's a top 4 guard this year  explain it to me."
PG: Stephen Curry     SG: Luka Doncic     SF: Kawhi Leonard    PF: Dirk Nowitzki     C: Tim Duncan
"If the rest of Zion's game is going to suffer from him doing his job better, then he is one of the most overhyped players to ever enter the NBA. Bottom line, Luka Doncic is averaging nearly ten boards a game and James Harden pulls down 8.4 per game. And they are both point guards, also with a gang of other guys competing on the glass. Zion has no excuse but to produce."
"With all the comparisons and debate between him and Luka, it would be great to see Doncic actually get the star treatment Trae does from the refs."
Is he better than LeBron? No.  Is he better than Kawhi? No.  Is he better than Nikola Jokic? No.  Is he better than Paul George? No.  Is he better than Anthony Davis? No.  Is he better than Luka Doncic? No.  Is he better than Rudy Gobert? No.  Is he a guard? No.  Is he an All-Star? Only as an injury replacement.

Luka Doncic
"&gt; For example, most people went into the year with Doncic higher on the MVP chances than Jokic. There is absolutely zero reason for that other than their respective draft positions.  Don't be obtuse, Luka was fourth in MVP voting last year and Jokic was ninth."
Luka Doncic for sure
"Trae young, Luka doncic, James harden. These are my favorite players to watch"
Doncic Luka
On guy went to college and then sat out almost his entire rookie year.   Fun fact: Luka Garza is older than Luka Doncic
In some alternate universe we have Luka Doncic and Zion Williamson
"&gt;Luka KP Giannis Sabonis Jokic  I'm very unsure that's the best European squad.  The problem if any, is balance, as Europe has too many bigs with those, plus Gobert, Markkanen, and Capela, and not that many guards.  Doncic/Fournier/Antetokounmpo/Jokic/Gobert beats your European team, in my opinion.  A second unit of five of Schroder, Bogdanovic, Sabonis, Vucevic, Markkanen, Porzingis would be entertaining as hell, but obviously couldn't guard any wings.  All of which ignores the many very good players currently playing in Europe."
"Yup, 2007-2010 Kobe was that dude. Numbers weren't the same as Lebron but he just knew how to win. I akin the comparison to today's Damian Lillard and Luka Doncic. Surely you take Doncic's numbers just on paper but Dame just knows what it takes to win better right now."
Luka ‘despite the loss’ Doncic
Luka Doncic Jalen Brunson and a first is enough right?
"&gt;Your entire profile is you doing this exact same thing for Luka, btw.  everything in regards to Doncic is backed up by stats. And you're acting like my last 3 comments in regards to him aren't trashing him on his defense.  ""if Lebrun had better spacing he'd be better offensive player"" great analysis."
Luka Doncic.
"&gt;Hopefully the Mavs figure out a way to maximize Luka the next few years he's still on a rookie deal  Well our team is kinda meh this year because we went all in on cap space potential in case Giannis opted out for 2021. I don't mind us being mediocre right now, but we damn sure better use our cap space this summer.   The growing sentiment on our sub (even the old heads like me) is that if KP doesn't start looking better on defense, he needs to be traded. Right now he's just bad at rim protection, which was supposed to be one of his strengths. If he stays at current level, he's fine as a complementary player on a title team because of his offensive spacing but his lack of defense means he's not worth the max. Which is a problem for building out the rest of the roster.  Best case scenario is that we play well enough this year that Doncic/KP can recruit a third player to take a pay cut for the chance at a superteam. With the understanding that we will be renegotiating KP to less money when his contract is up.  Obviously that's a pipe dream but it demonstrates where we're at. KP's max wouldn't be a bad contract if he was even *decent* on defense. But currently, his lineups have the worst defensive rating in the *entire NBA* for players who average more than 20min a game."

Really starting to see Luka “despite the loss” Doncic

"I’m going to ignore the ‘this team would beat this team’ shit because you can’t possibly prove that and I’m not going to play that. Great players adapt, so I believe the Celtics, Heat, Etc. Of that Era would adjust to the style of play of this era.   As for Rose’s MVP season, he averaged 25 points 7.7 assists and 4 boards per game for the team with the best record in the NBA. He absolutely deserved MVP. He carried that team on his back. Lebron had a significantly better team with much higher regular season expectations that they failed to meet.   Rose Vs. Doncic is interesting because the league has changed. Pace of play is so much higher today than it was then. Highest paced team in the NBA that season was Minnesota at 100.4. That would place third to last this year. The Mavs are about 9 points of pace ahead of Rose’s Chicago team. Playing in a similar system to Luka, I’m pretty confident MVP Rose can pick up 3 more points and an assist to match Luka with that uptick in pace. Prime Rose would love this NBA with his Speed."
"Difference is Dame is a 30 y/o veteran, while Luka is 21 almost 22. These kind of growing pains are expected, but based off what we’ve seen Doncic will bounce back. The rest of the team however, we’ll see"
"Luka ""Despite The Loss"" Doncic"
Luka “despite the loss” Doncic
"Luka ""shaved armpits"" Doncic"
"Luka ""Pascal Siakam"" Doncic"
Luka “despite the loss” Doncic
I hope dame daps up Luka when doncic checks in for him in the all star game
luka doncic is good at basketball
"LADIES AND GENTS, THERE GOES YOUR NEW FLOATER 3,PATENTED BY LUKA DONCIC"
"This is a wild card game. With Dame and Kanter having 1 technical foul already, and Luka Doncic on the other team, this could go either way. I think Portland will win, but whatever bullshit Scott Foster decides to do is going to dictate how this game goes."
Luka doncic flair complaining about someone complaint aboht the refs. hmmm  maybe first free throw with 2 minutes left in the half might be a reason
"&gt;Trae is an outlier and so is Embiid or Doncic  I don't know why people act like the sky is falling because Luka takes 8 FTs a game. That's down from last year, by the way.  Iverson averaged more than that for 12 years in a row back when ""pLaYeRs WeRe AlLoWeD tO pLaY dEfEnSe."""
"I remember a few games ago where Steph jumped sideways into Jakob just outside the post to draw a foul, and in the game thread there were a bunch of Warriors fans defending the play and saying how Curry is just a genius and just being crafty.  like, yall were literally complaining about Luka Doncic the previous game for doing essentially the exact same thing!  and who the fuck jumps sideways into a defender? that isn't a natural shooting motion in the slightest. you're literally creating 100% of the contact."
"I know you're a Dallas fan, but Luka has not earned that distinction whatsoever. Harden has led the league in assists and his playmaking is incredible. Jokic can do water polo passes that no one else can, but Doncic has no such edge over Harden."
Luka Doncic
For positons   PG Bradley Beal/Damian Lillard  SG James Harden/Luka doncic  SF Lebron James/Gianis Antetunkumpo  PF  Durant/Jokic  C Towns/Embied
Remember that one time when Harden copied Luka Doncic on the between the legs pocket pass before Luka was even in the NBA?
"Starters  G: Stephen Curry  G: Damian Lillard  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Lebron James  F: Nikola Jokic  Reserves  G: Luka Doncic  G: Donovan Mitchell  F: Anthony Davis   F: Paul George  F: Rudy Gobert  WC: Devin Booker  WC: CP3  These are just my predictions, not who I necessarily *think* should make it. For example, De’aaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he’ll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn’t good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"By the way here's a mind bender for you. Trae Young vs Luka Doncic. Same draft class. Same foul baiting BS. One of them gets shit on relentlessly for it, the other is sucked off like no other with far less hate. Gee I wonder why?"
And few of those points came from perimeter shooting. Teams would sag off of him and effectively double wade because of Lebron’s poor 3 pt and mid range shooting. Having a stat line worse than Luka doncic is not impressive.
"It 100% was worth a pick, 2 players, and cash considerations over paying JJ Redick 95% of his salary to ride the bench for the Nets lol.   Dell Demps did right by every player of his, offered Boogie Cousins $40 million coming off a fully ruptured achilles. Didn't stop Boogie and his agent from publicly shitting on him and NOLA for ""being a snake"" when THEY were the ones who foolishly turned down that money. Now he's begging the Clippers for a 10 day. Griffin ""did right"" by AD AND Jrue sending them both where they wanted. But now ""nobody will ever trust him again"" and he's a snake too... because 36 year old JJ Reddick has to play with Luka Doncic instead of Harden in NY? FOH lmao; can't win with these cats as they say. The GMs job is to build a team around Zion, point blank. Picks, players, assets of any kind help. ""Goodwill"" that players turn around and shit on and disregard at the drop of a hat whenever they selfishly feel like don't."
Harden and Westbrook were both reaches I think. Like KD was a no-brainer but those two picks are still impressive. Being able to actually evaluate top talent matters. Not being able to do so is how you end up taking Markelle Fultz over Jayson Tatum or Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic.
Meyers Leonard   Luka Doncic   JJ Reddick  Kyle Korver   Tyler Herro
And Luka Doncic. And anthony davis.

"They actually track uncontested rebounds and players like Russel Wetbrook (76.4%) and Luka Doncic (73.9%) have a majority of them uncontested. They grab like 2.3 contested rebounds a game. A player like Steven Adams has 49.1% contested rebounds and grabs 4.4 of them a game. One of my favorite on/off stats is rebounding and a player like Steven Adams who doesn't average a lot of rebounds actually significantly improves his teams rebounding (and Pelicans are the number 1 rebounding team in the league this year and Adams has been on number 1 rebounding OKC team in the league so this is saying a lot).  When Luka is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612742&amp;VsPlayerID=1629029&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) their team gets 49.3% of rebounds and when he is off the court they get 48.9% of rebounds so he slightly increases his teams rebounding by less than half a percent.  When Steven Adams is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612740&amp;VsPlayerID=203500) his team gets 54.5% of all rebounds. When he is off they get 51.8% which is a pretty good percentage and he makes a pretty good rebounding team a good amount better.  With Russell Westbrook is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612764&amp;VsPlayerID=201566) his team gets 47.6% of rebounds and when he is off his team actually gets a good amount more at 49.7%. He actually makes a mediocre rebounding team worse. However, have to remember on/off is finicky and if you cycle through a couple different years, there has been years Westbrook has made his OKC teams better at rebounding in terms of on/off by a decent amount."
"The year is 20XX. De’Aaron Fox plays at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on the injury report.

poor mans luka doncic.  If he develops a jumpshot he should be pretty lethal tho
Safe bet Lakers. Underdog bet Luka Doncic whatever team he goes to after the Mavs
The Bulls did exactly this with Lopez and Justin Holiday a few years ago.  The league called Shananigans and made them return to the team. Between that and Garpax signing Sean KilDraftPick it cost the Bulls Luka Doncic.

"I'll take one Luka Doncic, please."
"&gt; You don’t need stats to see Luka is 10x better than Ayton.  Luka as a rookie had higher USG than almost any other PG ever. His rookie USG% was higher than any year of Stockton, Magic Johnson, Nash, and Chris Paul. He also has Westbrook style uncontested rebounds. People ignore defense and put up too much value on guards who put up numbers. We shall see, but I really think there is a reason Porzingis has looked better without Doncic and it isn't just his injuries."
"Nephew, he's just not as good, it ain't that complicated. Why isn't jared dudley as good as Luka Doncic? Because he just doesn't have his talent."
"3.5 assists is a pretty huge margin... that’s the difference between Luka Doncic and Giannis.  Zion can and maybe should be your answer, but that don’t invalidate choosing Demar.  Not to mention Zion’s ineptitude on defense at his position is more detrimental than Demar’s"

"Luka is basically my favorite player, I don't have anything against him. The post is about bad officiating so obviously Doncic is not the one I am being critical with, and he is obviously not the only one that does these plays. It was either him or Steph the one that was being mentioned because both were a clear and recent example of this issue rather than the Donnovan one that can be more debatable.  It is not the players fault that they use the rulebook in their favor but rather a ref one, because they should be the ones punishing these kind of actions to control the game (instead of throwing random techs)."

At least he drafted Fox but that's probably a fluke since he didnt take the golden ticket that only comes once in a decade in Luka Doncic when he had the chance.
Jason Kidd  Rolando Blackman  Mark Aguirre  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki
Suns could have drafted   * Jamal Murray  * Domantas Sabonis  * Donavan Mitchell  * Luka Doncic  Instead of :  * Dragan Bender  * Marquese Chriss  * Josh Jackson  * DeAndre Ayton  to pair with Booker since. This game can be played with pretty much every team in the lottery.
"Giannis Antetokounpo, DeAaron Fox, Luka Doncic"
I think he’s offence is superstar level but his defence and playmaking are a tier below so in my opinion he’s just outside the superstar level with guys like Jimmy Butler and Luka Doncic
ryan hollins was actually right about Luka Doncic being the best player in that draft class before the draft took place  even a broken clock is right twice a day
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"

His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
Great Value Luka Doncic.
Guys who have a better dFG at the rim than jokic contesting at least 90 shots this year   SGA  Fred Van Vleet  Luka Doncic   Garrett Temple  Justin Holiday   Yes that’s the same fred Van Vleet who isn’t tall enough to be allowed on like half the rides at six flags
"A lot of people who try to make him out to be a good defender are the one place a lot of value on ""advanced stats"" that are box score stats like DBPM or defensive RPM that use different formulas based on players box scores to determine if they are good or bad. Last year Jokic was number 5 in the league in DRPM for example. A lot of these overrate players who get a lot of volume stats like Hasan Whiteside and Luka Doncic but underrate players like Klay Thomson and Dennis Rodman."

Kings could have had Luka Doncic for free
"Luka Doncic showed in that first half why he was an MVP favorite before the season. He can do whatever he wants. No one throws better cross court passes either, It's unbelievable how easily he can make them."
Lmao are we comparing Lamelo to Luka fucking Doncic now? That's so disrespectful to Luka
"&gt;That’s what I mean. I have Butler closer to 9 but when I truly try to think why someone like AD, Luka, or even Dame is better I can’t come up with a concrete answer.  They impact winning basketball more imo.  &gt;They score more, but Luka and Dame can’t playmake or defend like him  Doncic is a better playmaker than Butler.  &gt;I’m trying to not be a homer, but what separates a top 5 player is so arbitrary and just seems to be how much they score and how popular they are.  Obviously Bron, Steph, Jokic, KD, Embiid shouldn’t be a question after that I don’t see why not Butler.  Well there you go. He's simply not a top5 player in your opinion. As I said, you can make an argument (not a very strong one imo) for him being in the top10, but top5 is inarguable."
"Yeah and we all know all-in-one stats are super accurate in all cases. The real reason we’re good is cam Johnson. I mean, he’s a better player than luka doncic! (By rpm)."
"Funnily enough I don't see one on here that would be pertinent to you, the Eurostep.  It's where a player takes two long strides, usually to get around a defender, before shooting.  Popularized by Manu Ginobli (who's actually Argentinian) in the early 2000s, the Eurostep is one of the most utilized moves in basketball today.  Here's a video of the [originator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_uuArb_bho) and one of my favorite team's star [Luka Doncic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21lggpbHq3w) from last year's playoffs."
LeBron will win now   Jokic has insanely good stats 27/11/9 plus 1.5 steals on 57/42/88 shooting line. The Nuggets are up to 5th seed now and moving up. He also plays with ZERO all stars.   BUT nobody in mainstream knows Jokic. The NBA pushes Luka wayyyy more than Joker and I don't understand why. Like if Luka was putting up stats like Jokic he would win MVP.   My top 10 for MVP \[with Embiid out\]   1. LeBron 2. Jokic \[deserves it but won't win\]  3. DAME time 4. Harden 5. CP3  6. Giannis 7. Doncic  8. Gobert  9. Curry 10. Butler
I wouldn't trade AD for Luka Doncic and Trae Young together tho.
"If Luka Doncic and Paige Bueckers had a son, would be be the undisputed goat in the future?"
Trae Young  Kawhi Leonard  Luka Doncic  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Jayson Tatum  Bam Adebayo  LaMelo Ball  Are the only current players winning an MVP in their careers
You know who’s a really good player?  Luka Doncic.  I wish my team drafted and kept him.
Ayton and Doncic.   Really difficult to talk about Ayton here and in the Suns sub without knowing the background that he went first over Luka in the draft.
"Go look up the stat, it has so many outliers it seems pretty worthless. It has Jakob Poetl higher than Luka Doncic, James Harden and Kevin Durant in overall raptor for instance. It also has Conley as the 7'th best defensive player in the NBA."
Because winning is the most important criteria for MVP. Unless the Jazz players the Suns' stars have good stats to go with their winning to complete the MVP race.  If someone more popular like Luka Doncic or Steph Curry had the 2nd best record in the league like the Suns do they would be MVP favorites.
u really think luka doncic who's like 21 hasn't proved a much in the nba is better than Jimmy bulter. Ur fucking delusional. Luka is overhyped. He's not top 10. Plenty of player better than him
I am and always will be a maverick hater but Luka Doncic made me almost want to buy a maverick jersey.
"Lamelo Ball, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion Williamson, Luka Doncic"
"didn’t say it was a 1 for 1 trade   also i wouldn’t be so sure about it, there aren’t many better fits in the league next to luka doncic than marcus smart would be, you’d be pretty hard pressed to field a better offer for KP than smart+ stuff"
Did Montrezl Harrell get in trouble for calling Luka Doncic a pussy ass white boy?
I’d rather have doncic than brown and Tatum combined. He’s that much better than them. Even with porzingis in a stretcher I’d prefer luka over brown and Tatum. Also mavs have more flexibility outside of porzingis than Boston does.   And you’re seriously underrating Phoenix outside of Paul. They have a lot of young talent and that team was rising regardless or cp3 or not. Same thing with the hawks and also the grizzlies. Boston has virtually no young talent on the roster outside of brown and Tatum. These teams have a lot more or they have luka who’s just that much better than brown and Tatum.  And keep believing Tatum will sign the super max if this team doesn’t start going all in to improve the roster.
"I mean including players signed as part of a trade is definitely lame but cap space is a very real asset that one looks for in a trade so you should try to understand why if you plan on engaging in these discussions.    The Mavs took on THjr’s 20M and then gave KP a max extension (something the Knicks Fo maybe wouldve had to do ourselves if we didnt move him)  That’s not nothing, that’s a huge amount of cap space that we are still reaping the benefits from in this season.   Knicks could have definitely gotten a better offer for Porzingis but Porzingis would have had to guarantee to resign with that team which gave KP the power to choose in a way.  So he chose his old friend Luka Doncic."
Maxi Kleber will star as Luka Doncic in his biography.
It’s all just semantics   I remember Derek Bodner once talking about how when JJ Redick was in Philly there would be games they would list JJ as a forward in the pre game pressers they give to the media just because Ben was obsessed with being called a point guard. He wanted to be considered a guard he’s one of the two franchise cornerstones on the roster Philly gave him what he wanted   What players want is what dictates this more than actual usage or role. Luka wants to get listed as a guard in the starting lineup that’s why they’ve done it largely. That and also when it’s between him and Dorian Finney Smith you are more likely to classify Doncic as a guard
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
What about the hawks fan who got banned for posting too much about Luka Doncic
"My 2nd favorite team would have the be the Mavs. I’m a big fan of Luka Doncic and his style of play. Also, Mark Cuban strikes me as a stand up guy and a great owner."
Why are people so obsessed with protecting Luca Doncic? No one on the planet—including Perk—though Perk was better than Luka. Nobody even gives a fuck about Perk anymore. He is absolutely irrelevant. And someone was monitoring Luka’s point totals they could tweet when he eclipsed Kendrick Perkins? Is poor Luka so precious that he has to be utterly protected from the smallest thing?

"Luka never actually switched onto Derozan, it was just what's called a ""show"", where he jumps out in front to cut him off and give Derozan's man Finney-Smith time to recover from the screen. Once he shows he tries to get back to his man Gay and prevent the pass, and Derozan drives right behind him. This looks weird because of poor execution by Doncic and Finney-Smith (with help from a questionably legal screen from Gay)."

Hoping for some Luka (not Doncic) action at some point. He was looking great after being recalled. Would be a shame if he wasn't able to see consistent minutes after the fact.
Luka Doncic tho
Oh ok but if luka doncic said “you stupid fucking n-word” on live TV we wouldn’t care? The double standard with jews vs other minorities is so mindblowing and its simply because jews have white skin
"I find people's reactions to these things more interesting than the actual controversy.   Is Leonard some sort of anti-Semitic neo-Nazi? I'm going to guess probably not.   Did he say something stupid and offensive which he should should some contrition for? Yes.   Does he deserve nationwide attention and a suspension that will cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars and become a huge red mark against his image? Come on.   This and the Montrezl Harrell- Luka Doncic incident don't have any real impact on anything, but the way people react to it to try to defend their corners or spread indignation is what I find most fascinating and relevant. Either we decide to stop giving a fuck about the small things or we keep raising the temperature."
But there was no issues when Montrezl Harrell and his racial comment towards Luka Doncic. Something screams double standards. If you want to punish Meyers Leonard then Montrezl should be punished too
Can anybody tell me if NBA will suspend a guy who called Luka Doncic a 'white boy' during the game? :)
"Dude. Come on.   I know how sensitive things are in 2021 but there is absolutely no way that Luka fucking Doncic would be straight up banned from the NBA for saying a word. I don’t care what the word is.   The stars would not “refuse to play” and shut the league down because a guy said the n-word. That’s ridiculous. I could see stars not wanting to sign as free agents to be his teammates, or opponents no longer willing to speak with him/shake hands before or after games, but there’s no way they’d all just quit basketball because one person in the league said a hard-R one time.   With Sterling, the NBA hated him as a cheap ass owner and had been looking for a reason to get rid of him for years. Him being a billionaire has little weight because every owner is a billionaire. There are few players like Luka Doncic. His popularity would suffer, but no chance he’d be forced out of the NBA like you’re claiming"
"&gt;This is in part a direct result of the premium on shooting: the guys who are great drivers and finishers but can't shoot from deep don't really have a place in the league anymore.  That's just not true didn't we all just witness [Jimmy Butler put up 40 in the Finals without making a 3.](https://www.nba.com/news/jimmy-butler-triple-double-finals) Jimmy was the first player to do that since Shaq did it in 2002. I would argue that there are definitely places for those guys in the league, guys like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Giannis Antetokounmpo have the ability to score but they usually just look and play differently in this area. In this area, those guys have to be a physically dominant point forward type players and are be able to play bully ball in the post and run freely and physically dominant opponents in the halfcourt, or else it's much harder for them to exist. Zion is another good example of this because although he can sometimes shoot the three, he prefers to score mostly in the paint. Another key point to this is being a good free-throw shooter which why I would argue Jimmy Butler is the most prominent and best prototype of this type of scorer in the NBA.   The other type of player that can thrive nowadays without being able to shoot from deep, is a guard, particularly one who is either incredibly athletic and/or skilled whose best skill is usually their vision and passing rather than their ability to score (although most of these players can and do have multiple ways to score but are generally pass-first point guards). Guards like De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and to a lesser extent Demar Derozan. As I mentioned before these guards with the exception of Derozan (although he has become a much better playmaker in his Spurs era) are pass-first guards which means that they look to make plays and find their teammates before scoring. It's also to note that when most of these guards do score they score either in the paint or the mid-range because they either have the physical strength like Luka does to body other players and easily get to the paint or the free-throw line or they have the handles, athleticism and quickness like Fox, Morant, and Westbrook do to blow pass their opponents to finish at the rim."
"https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/black-hebrew-israelites  Yeah, they’re a fucking hate group. If Luka Doncic supported statements and social media post from the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers and said “I didn’t know these guys were racist they support xyz community” everyone would say that’s an absolute bullshit excuse because they are hate groups. Same thing with the Black Hebrew Israelites."
"That was a different era, and even then I think you’re overestimating the threshold for acceptable trash talking.  I can guarantee you luka doncic is not throwing around hard Rs at Mavs practices."
"Luka ""Jimmy Woo"" Doncic"
"Maybe it is a weird bad business decision.  They have their reasons I guess.  These kinda incremental trades up and down the draft are not unheard of.  Two off the top are 2018 Trae Young and Luka Doncic were 3rd and 5th traded.  Then there is 1998, Antawn Jamison for Vince Carter.  Pick 4 and 5.  There are probably more but I'm not gonna dig."
"Too early to tell imo. If one player ends up way better than it’s clear who won. Luka might not have gotten as many shots on the suns, but they really blew it picking Ayton over Doncic just based on player quality.   (No I’m not saying Lamelo is Luka don’t downvote me to oblivion lmao)"
"This ain’t it. If the winner is what you’re interested in — Jokic has had a substantially better and more impactful season than Doncic, there’s no reason Luka should get votes over him.  Now if Mavs escape the play-in, Luka will get the votes in accordance with his performance relative to the field — a smattering of bottom-of-the-ballot 4th and 5th-placed votes. In the absolute best case scenario where he has a particularly great finish to the season, especially if Mavs somehow get to the 5th seed, he might even finish 4th overall like last year. But win the award? No. Definitely not."

In Spain this is been discussed last week (they follow a lot of Luka progression after his stage in Real Madrid).   It started with a couple of KP’s interviews where he was especially cold talking about Doncic.
"As a Knicks fan who has watched KP for years and realizes his strengths, weaknesses &amp; potential capabilities, as well as someone who lusted for Doncic in the draft and have since seen his game translate astoundingly well into the league...  I gotta say KP needs to fall back. The team was Luka's before KP set foot there &amp; KP hasn't been the force I think most Mavs fans were hoping to get. He hasn't put Dallas over the hump or made them a consistent playoff threat. Luka definitely puts the team on his shoulders. KP couldn't manage that in NY &amp; looks to be the same now. I think that year he was the best player in NY may have went to his head. You gotta be competitive &amp; you gotta be confident but you also got to know when to put your ego aside &amp; fall into the role you have, until you're able to earn the role you want."
"It’s very unlikely any of those guys get traded, but most of those guys aren’t untradeable   If Luka doncic woke up tomorrow and decided he was never playing for the mavs again guys are gonna get moved.   Bron, Steph, Luka, Zion, giannis, jokic, and kd are the only sure fire, no questions asked untradeable guys in the league.   Dame maybe out of blind loyalty.

"Luka + whatever else Dallas has &gt; Your entire young core.  Dallas has a better young core than you because they have Luka Doncic and he's so much better than everybody that you have combined. Is it ""more well-rounded"" sure-- would you rather have LeBron, or a more well-rounded team?"
"in eight bubble games—including one against the Utah Jazz that Luka missed, plus two against the Clippers vaunted defense—the Mavs have been even better on offense when Doncic sits. Plus/minus numbers are useless without context, but this is still a little strange."

"Hawks have a much better roster and if you swap Luka for Trae they're probably a 2 seed and would be considered ""legit"" by a lot more people because they have a top 10 player in the NBA which you need to win in today's NBA. It sucks to say because Trae's my favorite player but it's true and the only thing bad that would come from us keeping Luka Doncic would be the fact that we would have LP as a coach still."

"I guess I would ask first: What do you want to see out of Luka?     My first two go-tos were an aging LeBron, or current Durant. Both are so skilled on offense that they have the luxury of looking at their team on the floor, and just filling in the gaps seemingly effortlessly. (The transformation of Harden's game since moving to Brooklyn makes me want to throw him in here too, but I didn't, whatever) I say an aging LeBron here because in his PRIME prime, you'd be either wasting him or Luka a little bit because of how ball dominant both of them should be, but a LeBron in his later 30's, looking to save a little mileage and still 90-95% as good as he ever was? That's a wrap.     Next are the big men partners: AD or Embiid would be amazing. Both fierce rim-protectors, both able to score at will down low, both comfortable with midrange shots, AD has the edge over Joel at shooting 3's, but if both are healthy and trying their hardest, that's about the only edge I'd give Davis. Giannis would be an incredible partner, too, but I leave him third in here due to long range shooting. Pair Luka with any of these guys, and you have something potentially better than a Stockton/Malone combo, and that shit was amazing.     For guards, I'm thinking of someone where Luka CAN be the main guy, but doesn't always have to be. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson come to mind. Both of them have no problem not bringing the ball up and initiating the offense, but instead running all over the court through a million picks and setting screens for their teammates. This opens up so much for Doncic with the opposing teams terrified of his marksman teammates, and having to settle into something like a zone defense, or at least strongly discouraging opposing defenses from doubling too often. Also into this group I'd toss Kyrie, who is at his best, IMO, when there's a second option as good or better than him. As a wild card, I'll throw in Ja Morant, just because I'd love to watch it."
"lol 'shitty'. Dirk got to play next to some excellent players in his career. His *favorite* player growing up was LeBron. I'm just guessing here but that doesn't bode well for you guys.   That's not even the main point. The main point is that the future of the Mavs outside of Luka isn't looking very bright. Asset strapped, soon to be capped out with Zingis on a max. Ouch. Can very easily see Doncic the diva wanting to jump to a team like LA, NY, or Philly soon."
"The year is 20XX. De’Aaron Fox plays at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on the injury report. The Fox availability metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches. Humanity has reached its pinnacle. The low tier peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leader of 20XX, the Sacramento Kings, and their army, the Fox monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Fox with one hand, and winning championships with the other. The basketball metagame has gotten to this point where everything is played out to theoretical perfection, so other teams pray Fox is out for the night, and that’s the game.  The leaders of the anti-20XX movement aim to keep 20XX from coming. These warriors include Trae Young, Luka Doncic, LaMelo Ball, and Cade Cunningham. They are all fighting to keep the apocalypse at bay, the De’Foxcalypse . But their efforts are futile. Their silly stepbacks, thirty foot jumpers, slick passes, and height are no match for Fox’s raw speed, the only viable advantage in the National Basketball Association’s version of basketball. Try as you will, but 20XX is coming. Or maybe, it’s already here."
"They didn't give up that much... like the key parts of the trade were these:  Mavs get: Porzingis  Knicks get: unprotected 2021 1RP + top 10 protected 2023 1RP ​  With Doncic, those picks seemed pretty unlikely to be all that good even if KP never played, especially the 2021 pick.  I still agree with you that the trade was stupid because if Luka is great, there's a good chance you can get a proven star to join him via FA or trade demand. KP was a gamble a team with Luka Doncic didn't need to take.   I still think the Mavs could dump KP without a bribe. He's young enough and close enough to the long injury (suggesting a chance he's still reacclimating) that a bad team might take the risk.  But hte lesson there is you can make a lot of mistakes when you draft a superstar."

"* Mavericks would have been better off in the long run if Luka Doncic did not get so good so quick. By bringing them to playoff contention so soon, they lost any chance of drafting high and bringing in another talented prospect as a top 10 pick in 2020 draft. If it had taken 2-3 years to get into playoff contention they may have had 1-2 top 10 picks with which to build a better core around. Instead they need to now sign big time Free Agents to cultivate true talent."

Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i´ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren´t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"

I’m not agreeing with the take on Ayton vs Doncic but theoretically a player could have a lower ceiling than Luka and still end up better.

"QUESTION: Why was the first technical foul called on Luka Doncic?  &gt;&gt;MOTT: “The first technical foul was called after a correct call, offensive foul, and in transition he runs past me and he screams ‘hell no’ as he shakes his fist. Which is a disrespectful response to a referee, that is unsportsmanlike.”     QUESTION: Why was the second technical foul called on Doncic?  &gt;MOTT: “The second technical foul was called for throwing the ball due to frustrations of a call. Throwing the ball, the length of the court in an overt manner which is also an unsportsmanlike technical foul.”     QUESTION: “Why was that unsportsmanlike instead of delay of game?”  &gt;MOTT: “We had a time out and he takes the ball and he doesn’t throw it to the nearest official, he throws the ball the length of the court which makes it an unsportsmanlike act.  The rule clearly states that you have to hand the ball to the nearest official.”     QUESTION: Why was the second technical foul called on Rick Carlisle?  &gt;MOTT: “Rick Carlisle called a timeout and then he came out on the floor and he addressed the official in a disrespectful manner using vulgarity.  Which was his second technical foul so therefore he was ejected.”"

"Petition to change it to Luka ""The Gathering"" Doncic."
Liked by luka doncic lmao
"Then why isn't Luka 'Tough Bucket Boy"" Doncic a thing?"
Westbrook is a   9x All Pro 9x All Star 2x Scoring leader 2x Assist leader (about to be 3) 1x MVP  Doncic is  2x all star 1x All NBA  we will see how his career pans out but he has a lot to do before he catches up to westbrook accolade wise. i’m referring to the “top 10 all time” notion posted above. Talent wise luka has it.
"The Mavs also have 20 mill in cap space after Redick and Hardaway expire. They can sign a big free agent this year and still keep Luka because restricted free agency. Then they could trade Josh Richardson, Josh Green and a few firsts for Bradley Beal. Doncic/Beal/DeRozan/Kleber/Porzingis is a team that could happen. Lebron and the Nets are both aging so this team could be the next powerhouse of the league."
"The nickname isn’t “Magic” it’s “Luka Magic”. And it’s usually not a nickname, but a reference to what he’s doing out on the court.   I agree, though, Luka “Magic” Doncic is not the way to write that"
"He shouldn't it's Magic's name when people say Magic nobody thinks Luka Doncic they think Magic Johnson. 2 years that's a long time, Magic Johnson has been Magic for 47 years. Luka deserves his own nickname because he is his own player. What's next are we going to call Zion King Z? Ja The Answer Morant? LaMelo The Truth Ball? Pistol Trey Young? Julius Dr. J Randle? The legends of the game deserve to be respected."

"&gt;Luka “Magic” Doncic  This is disrespectful to the real Magic. Let Luka earn/have his own nickname, dont rehash legendary nicknames. What next? Will Gobert be the Diesel? Change RJ Barrett from Maple Mamba to Black Mamba? Joel The Dream Embid?"
Russell Westbrook woke up today and chose violence.   It’s just Luka Doncic also woke up and chose more violence.
"One would think that after the Luka Doncic ""fiasco"" people would understand that if you succeed overseas as a teen you will be decent in the NBA as well."
Luka Doncic fan boys in here who rate him as a better PG than Steph and Dame.

"He is a not a mix of anybody, hes Luka Doncic"
"Luka ""I am comfortable in double teams"" Doncic"
Pure intimidation from all time defender Luka Doncic.  Anybody would lose the ball in that situation.
Luka Doncic is a basketball player.
"For context, the previous record-holder was Luka Doncic for whom it took 187 games."
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
"Problem for Trae, he's always going to be compared with Luka Doncic due to the draft. He's a good player but those two will be linked for a long time."

"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
"Hindsight is 20/20. No one thought Jokic would be this good. Most people probably had him as a career role player at most.  For every horrible incorrect prediction, there's one amazing correct prediction that everyone makes.  Over the years, I've had some really bad takes about players I thought would become superstars pre-draft: Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Wiggins, Fultz, Marqueese Chris. Then there's been players I thought would be generational talents that i hit on: Luka Doncic, Lamelo, Klay Thompson."
"&gt; Dwight and Javale were played off the court multiple times  The same way Trez was played off the court by both Luka Doncic and Jamal Murray in the series he played in.  &gt; Schroeder's been keeping the team afloat for much of this stretch.  I disagree, their defense has been BY FAR the main reason why they've won some games in this stretch and that hardly has anything to do with Dennis Schroeder, in fact they have the worst offense in the NBA since LeBron has gone down, they are winning games by holding their opponents to 90ish points."
"Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman  Luka Doncic, Tim Hardaway Jr., Kristaps Porzingis  I see no difference"
"Yeah, I've also noticed that. Coming from Europe, I'm a big fan of Doncic, but it's really not been that pleasant to watch Dallas this year - beacause of all the iso'ing.   I mean, ofc it's always amazing to watch Luka play, and you certainly have some decent role players too, but they just stand around way too much for my liking - honestly it's a little worrying for your future. I mean, sure Harden was amazing in Huston, but the hero ball led to no real playoff success."
No thank you. Holmes needs to come catch lobs from Luka Doncic.
"I think Luka Doncic has already 3. Clippers, Boston and Memphis I think. 2 from a deficit one from a tie."
The Kings passed on Luka Doncic and said they chose the right pick with confidence. LMFAO clown franchise
"Sorry Bro, Luka Doncic is the goat"
"BREAKING NEWS:  Windhurts reports that the Kicks are trying to lure Lebraawwn James, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, and Zion Willionson to try and and form the greatest  posse of all time!!  Unfortunately they already have one of the worst owners in all of sports.  Brought to you by a salty Nuggets fan."
"I agree with this statement which is why it pisses me off so much that Luka doncic is on the mavs. They legitimately ""tanked"". If they were winning they would pull their starters. They were even joking about it on the radio.    &gt; If a team trades all of their draft picks so they can win now, are they tanking in the future?    While trading all your draft picks is usually bad foresight, i think this is a stretch. Brooklyn traded all their picks and still made the playoffs"

People who never collected will never understand.  The hobby in the last few years has blown up to unexplainable means.  I guess we can look at luka doncic and the 2018 rc class starting the uptick.  Dont get me wrong there was plenty of money to be made prior.  But card collecting has became mainstream now.  Its at a point in collecting is hard.  Been collecting my whole life but were at a point where you can never find any retail products to open in stores.  People line up for hours waiting and will buy the whole product.  There's scalpers are crooks.  At 20 dollar box now cost 150.  I suggest its not worth getting into the hobby anymore.  The bubble I hope pops cause this is outrageous
Luka Doncic

KP sitting so only wise took make a good bet on this one. Dallas only needs to get in playoffs with Luka and KP HEALTHY so I’d advice you take it easy on your team MAVS fans. rest Doncic next game he looked uninterested today. Bummer loss but without KP and Luka it’s going to be hard.
Mavericks get: Luka Doncic   Kings get: Season series win against Mavericks for the rest of eternity
"&gt; And it could even out by the time a few years have gone by. As I said in my other response I expect Doncic to average more than Zion once he realizes he has to be even more selfish with the ball out there. It's literally the only thing holding him back.  He’s literally second in the league in USG% and FGA.  &gt;I don't think Zions body or style will hold up long enough to keep him playing at that level to make that 79 game start to their careers still mean something by the end.  He’s not even taking that many shot attempts, he’s super efficient. 31st in FGA, 8th in PPG. He could easily up his FGA, much more than Luka can."
"Ayton was actually good though, his issue was just Luka Doncic and the fact that average centers are so cheap"
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind. RJ Barrett comes in 3rd.* ***Thibs intensifies***  Booker (1884), Beal (1811), Mitchell (1771), LaVine (1867), Tatum (1959), Butler (1490)  *I hope Mitchell does not miss the rest of the season, but as of today, he's played nearly as many minutes as the other players vying for a spot on the all-NBA teams. Currently listed as week-to-week.*  Best unmentioned players by RAPTOR: Clint Capela, Mike Conley, FVV, Jrue Holiday, Jamal Murray, Draymond Green, Jakob Poeltl, Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, and Thaddeus Young. Anthony Davis (800) and Kevin Durant (812) played too few minutes, but have been effective in their limited time."
"Luka Doncic is already ahead of Tatum and he’s a year younger. 2x All-Star, All-NBA 1st team last season, pretty much guaranteed another All-NBA team this season and his EuroLeague MVP and Championship will definitely help. Hasn’t had the playoff success yet, but he also plays in the West."
You’d also be hard pressed to argue that a 35 year old Luka Doncic DOESN’T exist on Earth at this very moment via the convenience of futuristic time travel thus relegating Curry to only the 3rd best PG of all time.
"Oh damn I didn’t realize he made all-nba already.   Well by those standards, in 1-2 years Luka Doncic could also start to be considered on a HOF trajectory eh?"
 idk I think i'd take Luka Doncic straight up tbh
Bagley's development has been hindered by playing time and injuries. He's not going to be Luka Doncic or Trae Young but he's still got the tools and potential to be an all-star/fringe all-star.
"wiseman isnt a terrible shooter though no?  I mean he kinda has the skill set to fit that description of a modern day center but he didnt unlock everything (or most parts) of it in the offensive system of the warriors just yet which is expectable given his major lack of experience.  So I'd say given his talent and todays game requirements he could have come into the league (on another team) and totally nailed it, just that the entire situation made this season for him rather a big challenge and learning opportunity. Though imagine his pick and roll talents paired with Luka, I mean if Doncic can make Dwight Powell score 25 against the lakers surely Wiseman could have looked way better than he does on the Warriors."
What do you think about Luka Doncic?
Remember when dumb fuck Mavericks fans pretended that Luka Doncic suddenly became Damian Lillard from three lmaoooo
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5. Jaren Jackson Jr  6. Colin Sexton  7. DeAndre Ayton  8. Mikal Bridges  8. DeVonte Graham  9. Gary Trent Jr  10. Mitchell Robinson  11. Miles Bridges  12. Robert Williams  13. Jalen Brunson  14.

Marvin Bagley III  24. Jae Sean Tate  25. Landry shamet  26. Josh Okogie  27. Grayson Allen  28. Mo Bamba  29. Mo Wagner  30. Kevin Knox"
"Damian lillard has basically been swept in 3 of the last 4 years in the first round. Except last year he did manage to get one game against the lakers. And jrue holiday for most of his time on the Pelicans was definitely not better than cj has been for the Trail Blazers. Anyone saying AD just straight up doesn’t know basketball. Damian lillard is seriously one of the absolute worst defenders in the nba. Just look up his 5 year rapm for the past 5 years. Meanwhile AD is easily a top 10 defensive player. Dame is better offensively, but AD is still really good on offense.   Damian lillard is clearly the odd man out here and the only other even possible one to debate is Luka doncic."
"None of those are Luka, they are abstractions of Luka. I was under the impression you wanted me to look at the real deal Luka Doncic last year."
"Oh no, you can look at Luka Doncic last year many ways, you can look at the numbers from Luka Doncic, you can look at the haircuts of Luka Doncic, you can definitely look at Luka Doncic last year, there are many ways to look at Luka Doncic last year"
"Oh, no, you don’t get it, you don’t have to watch his play. You can actually look at a photo from last year too. There are plenty of ways to look at Luka Doncic from last year if that’s what you want to do, lol."
"""Oh you didn't watch Luka Doncic"""
Oh you didn’t watch Luka Doncic even in the playoffs last year?
clearly bette than Luka Doncic but OK...   Kyrie been top 10 since 2015
"How about the fact the Mavs are 1-4 without Doncic (all against non-playoff teams).   Players miss games, especially this year. Trae is actually fortunate how well Hawks have held up without him.  Looking at records when both players play, Mavs are much better with Luka."
"AG is a big, athletic wing with some real foot speed, which is right now the best defender against Luka, but pretty much only when paired with another really long player to double team him. That way he can't just throw a (for him) easy pass over his defenders and I don't really like Denvers options for the second guy, because I don't trust MPJ yet to do it smartly. AG would probably do a fine job, but Luka gets his.  Denver has a better way to beat Dallas, than trying to slow down Doncic and that is to kill the Mavs with Jokic owning the post. With his passing, scoring, offensive rebounding, nobody on the Mavs roster seems like a reasonable option against Nikola, except maybe a Boban surprise, but that wouldn't work for a full series.  I've seen Murray in the playoffs, but that doesn't change my opinion very specifically on his effectiveness against the Mavs, he has struggled against Dorian Finney-Smith and even Tim Hardaway Jr a lot. Denver is obviously better with Murray, but they would miss him more against pretty much every other team in the West and even without him they are imo a slight favourite against a fully healthy Dallas roster."
"i mean at the time you had an overweight dude from Serbia who had come off of a good year playing in Serbia and who had averaged 3.5 assists. So basically he was closer to a normal center with good passing fundamentals.   Even in his first year in the league you had a guy that was doing 2.4 assists, and while he was very good, was there indicators of him becoming the kind of player he is today (I didn't watch Denver back then). Like even the per 36 numbers his rookie year didn't show that court vision potential off.   For every Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic you end up with a Darko Milicic or Dragan Bender, it's a total crap shoot dealing with the draft and to call these guys idiots when they still had the idea to draft and pick him up still shows that someone viewed him as a prospect with potential.   You can't predict how a player will develop over time, it's pretty idiotic of you to say that these guys are idiots considering they literally have to evaluate 100+ potential players every year that may be worth picking up. 2014 was a draft of underrated gems, Joe Harris and Jerami Grant were both second rounders, Dwight Powell who just put on a show last night with Luka went after Jokic. Potential 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson went at 46. Clint Capela at 25, there were so many great prospects that were drafted all across the board not to mention guys like LaVine and Julius Randle going later in the first round. Everyone is going to remember 2014 for being the a low key bust for the biggest prospects from Wiggins and Parker when in reality it's going to go down as a sleeper draft where some truly elite players went very late in, likely a very difficult draft to call."

"Great point actually Lakers honestly probably don’t trap doncic at all postseason time. Lukas size let’s him pass over bigs like Drummond pretty easily compared to typical smaller guards.  Although it was giving Luka a bit of trouble first half surprisingly, he was picking up his dribble and holding it for some reason, but he cleaned it up quick"
Luka Doncic
"Luka Doncic on ESPN: ""I'm very comfortable getting double-teamed.""   Mentioned that he saw a ton of traps in Europe, but they aren't as hard to handle in the NBA. ""Here, the floor is little wider, so it's easier for me."""
"Luka ""Mahomes"" Doncic"
"Nah, we just won a championship. Ya'll never will with Luka ""basically James Harden""Doncic. Refs won't give him these tickets tack calls in the playoffs &amp; he will just pout his way to loss after loss after loss, just like Houston year after year after year. Have fun with that."
I would literally trade anyone in the league for Luka Doncic when u factor his talent and age in
Dude it's a long series and you guys have Luka fucking Doncic
"Luka ""Be Careful You Already Have A Technical"" Doncic"
"If we had a Luka Doncic level superstar who would attract all the attention, I’m positive at least Randle would be better. Randle’s not adjusting to the constant double teams."
"“I have to stop getting so upset with the refs.” - Luka Doncic, like, yesterday"
"I still see Luka as the best player in the series because of his ability to facilitate. Unfortunately, Dallas' second star isn't playing like one, and both of LA's are. Which, since they're up 2-1, just tells you how brilliant Doncic has been.     Dallas didn't just get hot shooting (although, they are hot, to be fair). Those wide open looks are being created by Luka. It's more than just comparing stat lines between he and Kawhi. Luka impacts the game in a way Kawhi can't, as the primary ball handler."
"""Trae just fits so much better"" I like Trae more than a lot of people on this sub, I think it was utterly ridiculous that Sabonis and Vucevic made the all star team above him, but how does he fit better than Luka ? He has a better floater game, that's litterally the only thing he does better than Doncic"
"What are you on about? The exact same Clippers team were close to breaking the NBA record for 3pt percentage with 9 guys over 40%. They never had a problem getting quality looks this series either, they just weren't hitting. If Doncic is so good at getting quality looks how did his team shoot this poorly in the regular season?  LOL AN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDER LOCKING DOWN LUKA???? You need to stop watching these dumb talk shows my dude. There's no such thing as one person locking down a top 5 offensive player on a 5 out offense team witih 5 shooters on the court. Pls just stop."
"He’s been amazing. I’m actually blown away by how good and steady he is at his age.  Funnily enough after seeing his play I’m reminded of the 1984 Draft.  Ayton was the 1st Pick, Hakeem. Great pick even though a couple picks below you had a potential GOAT. Houston never regretted that pick and rightly so, I doubt Phoenix will in the long run either.  Luka Doncic is putting up some GOAT level performances rn, and looks to be a multi time MVP on the league and despite being the third pick is clearly the best of the lot.  Marvin Bagley is Sam Bowie."
Luka is the leagues best P&amp;R ball handler statistically.   Nobody is more statistically efficient as a roll man than KP when setting a screen for Doncic. It’s literally the most efficient P&amp;R in the league.

Luka “54%” doncic
"Bill Simmons kissed the ring of Bird and r/NBA was given our lord and savior, Luka Doncic"
"Kawhi is still the second best player in the NBA. You can say he’s top 5 (I’m biased). But the main factor in this series is bench play. Luka is the best playmaker in this series and is playing like the best player as well. Kawhi is just not built to dominate the offense with his playmaking. His passes and creativity on offense off of traps and double teams are average at best and it takes the other role players to step up and make good passes and grrat open shots to match Doncic’s genius playmaking. Does that mean doncic is better than Kawhi? i don’t know, I’d argue Kawhi is still better but Doncic definitely “carries” better than Kawhi could. Especially on this “fraudulent” Clippers team filled with non championship (but talented) players."
"Celtics, no. They showed some fight today, but they just don't have the talent especially given they're not at full strength. It would take a monumental collapse from guys who I wouldn't expect to collapse in KD/Kyrie/Harden.  Clippers, of course. They are the *favored team and are supposed to win the series*. Luka Doncic is not some god-tier obstacle (yet), and the history doesn't matter today. They are not supposed to lose this."

"PG averaging 4 fouls a game, it's the refs, somehow THJ is averaging 1-2 defending the Clippers players like Kawhi &amp; PG?  No.  The Clippers defenders have been neutered, they're forced to give players like Luka a 3ft cushion, any time he throws his body into them auto-foul.  Some of the best defensive wing players of the generation do not suddenly become worse defenders than the likes of Doncic or THJ.    WWE."
"I would agree that the clippers defense hasnt been sharp, but there are legitimate complications with trapping Luka. Did the Kawhi Raptors ever face a 5-out offensive team with an offensive mastermind like Luka Doncic? They haven’t really been in that position so its hard to say how they would do but i guess they’d be better than the clippers"

Kawhi Leonard, the superstar who has earned a reputation as one of the premier stoppers in NBA history, matched up against Luka Doncic.   &gt;   &gt;The Mavericks responded by clearing out the right side of the court and letting their superstar go to work. Doncic backed down Leonard, pounding dribble after dribble until he got to the spot he wanted, then pivoted into a pretty one-legged fadeaway that surely made Staples Center spectator and Mavs legend Dirk Nowitzki proud.   &gt;   &gt;Swish.   &gt;   &gt;Welp, so much for that supposed solution. Head coach Tyronn Lue's Clippers tried pretty much everything to slow down the Mavs' superstar in the first two games of the series. They're still searching for something that works.

"The problem was switching with dudes like Beverley and Zubac who are BBQ chicken for Doncic. That's why I said with those 5 guys in particular, they have a chance of staying with Luka one on one, sure if Luka can cook Batum or Mann than go ahead, but they have a better chance of making him work for it than Beverley or Zubac, and at least you stay at home on Dallas' shooters so that they don't get open looks."
"They have Luka mf Doncic. The guy who makes the right pass every play. Surrounded by 4 shooters, one of whom is currently averaging 25 on 80% TS."
"Luka ""Swaggy L"" Doncic"
"Jokic and Luka are generational talents though and outliers as well. I think there’s a bit more going on than just ego and we might be conflating talent with other factors. If we’re purely discussing willingness to work hard — Jokic and Doncic could definitely use some work on their bodies.  Besides, other than Lebron you can point to dozens of other top American players that put in the work — westbrook, jimmy butler, chris paul etc."
They’re scrambled and disoriented from the blinding light glowing off of Luka Doncic.
NBA needs to crack down on Luka Doncic for going after Patrick Beverly's genetics.
Hey pretty new fan here. Just know nets are most likely going to win bar an injury. Watch any game with luka doncic playing. Ja morant is fire. And people in the bronx are very hype about the Knicks.
"Even if THJ says: Yeah, but these other dudes can match that, why should I sign?  Mavs can be like: We have Luka Doncic. Do you want your career to mean something? Or do you want to end up in a story book of first round exits that no one cares about."
"he is obviously trolling but there is truth in what he is saying. the mavs offense doesnt have many set plays. Its more about reading and react, which is built for playoffs since there is more unpredictability in the playoffs and opposing teams study you. Its even better when you have a player like Luka playing PG making the reads and when KP is with luka since he is also vital. If you want to read more about it, there is an article by iztok franko on mavs moneyball that explains it very well. here is the link:  [https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/5/22360922/dallas-mavericks-elite-offense-rick-carlisle-luka-doncic-jenny-boucek-mike-weinar-porzingis](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/5/22360922/dallas-mavericks-elite-offense-rick-carlisle-luka-doncic-jenny-boucek-mike-weinar-porzingis)"
nah if you can get Luka Doncic for Tatum+Time Lord that’s literally a no brainer  He’s a nice Center but come on lol
There is nothing to discuss. If any franchise is in a position to acquire Luka Doncic they do what it takes to get him.
"Ja is quite simply not in the same galaxy as Luka. Luka is probably 2 times all nba when voting results are out - Ja is not even considered for those honors. He had few good games now and is in general great talent - but Doncic is just levels above so far. Probably similar with Zion, tho I have to admit I haven't watched him much."
"Embiid, Giannis, and Jokic seem to be left out of this discussion despite all only being around 26 and better than Luka. I won’t deny it’s crazy impressive that Doncic is doin g this at 22, though. It feels like, barring injury, he’ll be the face of the league over the next decade."
Their excuse is that Luka Doncic is going to be the next Jordan
"Clippers are a different case, their defense was fine just last year. The only problem is that there is absolutely no defense in history that can stop Luka Doncic"
I have a tough time taking a one-way superstar over a two-way stud.  I admit that shot creation is the most important part of a player's game and that Luka is fine on defense but Joel is an elite defender and a very good offensive player too. If you want to take Doncic on youth or durability that makes sense but for a game tomorrow it depends on the rest of the team.
"Ja has played like a star over his past 3-4 games. All being playoff/playin games and he’s delivering night in and night out.  You sound like the same people who doubted Luka last year, he’s not a superstar but he has warranted all the praise he’s getting with his play.  Same way people fawned over Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, And Luka Doncic last playoffs. Let Ja have his moment."
"Luka ""Luke Doncic"" Doncic"
"Ja is playing well, but the fact that he’s had so much success doesn’t exactly bode well for facing Luka Doncic"
Luka Doncic Rick Carlisle and Ty Lue
"Ja Morant, Luka Doncic, Trae Young  The league is loaded with young talent exploding in the playoffs right now. Hopefully, SGA will be able to show this as well if OKC makes it into the playoffs sometime in the future"
"1. Magic Johnson  2. LeBron James  3. Luka Doncic  4. Ja Morant  What is this a list of? Youngest players with 40 points in the playoffs. Future is bright in Memphis.  But Mike Conley just knows how to close games. 14 assists with only two turnovers, and 20 points as well. His two man game with Gobert was their main weapon in the 4th.  God damn I hope this series goes 7 games"
Randle is doubled every possession and doesn’t play alongside luka doncic...
Remember when the Hawks traded out of the Luka Doncic pick yall
lmao someone salty that his stupid team chooses some random dude Ayton over Luka Doncic...Talk about being dumb.
"Zion = The Big Easy  Ben Simmons = Ben Kenobi (because of his Jedi force field that keeps all defenders 5 feet away on the perimeter)  Kawhi Leonard = Wi-Fi (because he's awesome until he decides to take a break on you)  Deandre Ayton = The Anomaly (per some writer on the Atlantic who called him an ""anomaly"" in his scouting report pre draft)  Markelle Fultz = MH370 (because his game disappeared and no one's sure why)  Luka Doncic = The Puppet Master (per Gilbert Arenas)  Andrew Wiggins = Adrian (his biggest youtube clip is a prankster asking him if his name is Adrian, which says a lot)"
He isnt. Luka doncic is.
Luka “The Don” Doncic
"Do you reckon there are insurance policies written on the contract of a player which payout during the even of a major injury? Perhaps the premium on such policies for players like Cousins, Embiid, and Davis are higher than say those on players like Draymond Green, Damian Lillard, and Luka Doncic. And on another hand, some players' contracts are so valuable that the premiums are probably high just because of the contract value such as Giannis or Lebron, you know?"

"Ben Taylor, the creator of Thinking Basketball, has a metric called PlayVal, which is described as ""Playmaking value, an estimate of a player’s points per 100 impact from playmaking only.""  According to this metric for the 2020-21 season (regular season), the top 10 players for this stat are:  1. James Harden 2. Nikola Jokic 3. Trae Young 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damian Lillard 6. Chris Paul 7. LeBron James 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Jimmy Butler 10. DeMar DeRozan"
&gt;where Luka Doncic was the best player on the floor every single game in that series..  Game 6 Kawhi destroyed Luka. 45 points on 18 of 25 shooting.
"&gt;I think this was a proper response from Paul. Especially with how big a shot he hit over him late in the game. The only Paul George stopper is Paul George.   How? That's fuckin ignorant. Big shot? They barely survived Dallas, where Luka Doncic was the best player on the floor.. and now they are trying to survive Utah  &gt;  JOE INGLES literally asked the media to NOT talk about Paul and him, because it's in the past. Ingles had every right to STUNT on Paul George and shit on him. Him and the Utah Jazz fucked Paul George in the Playoffs. But Ingles acted with MATURITY. That's the difference     &gt;   Paul George on the other hand, still acts like an ignorant and delusional shit head.     What was he saying when they had a giant lead last year against the Nuggets?  ""wE aRe in ThE dRivIng SeAt""   &gt;  What was he saying when he signed a fat contract with OKC??   ""uNfIniShed BusineSs""   &gt;  Dude's a literal headass"
"Out of context and a small sample size.. Makes such a difference  &gt;  It's literally just 16 4Q shots in the last 5 games Clippers won lol   &gt;  Kawhi and PG13 was invisible in more games in this same Playoffs..     Clippers barely survived Dallas, where Luka Doncic was the best player on the floor every single game in that series.. And now they are trying to survive Utah"
"&gt;He might want to consider not winning any more playoff games, and putting a printout of this post in his trophy cabinet.    Why? It's not even that impressive. Just a small sample size.. It's literally just 16 4Q shots in the last 5 games Clippers won   &gt;  Kawhi and PG13 was invisible in more games in this same Playoffs..     Clippers barely survived Dallas, where Luka Doncic was the best player on the floor every single game in that series.. And now they are trying to survive Utah  &gt;   Long fuckin way to go for Kawhi, PG13 and the Clippers. Otherwise they are going home again soon. None of their superstars are injured either. It's all or nothing  &gt;  Clippers gave up their entire FUTURE to OKC just to build this current team and have Kawhi + Paul George..  After what happened last year against the Nuggets.. this current Playoff run is a ""Win it all or Bust"" for them"
"You cant even compare Ayton to Luka directly... they play the game so differently and have different roles.. its like the Hakeem vs Jordan... Rockets did not lose by not drafting Jordan. Or the Duncan vs Kobe....   Doncic and Ayton will be similar to the Hakeem/Jordan, Duncan/Kobe situation as in both are great for their teams regardless of who is better overall."
"As one of the Suns fans who wanted to trade Booker for Pick 2 back 2018 to draft Luka next to Ayton.... I have to say this...      Suns found their ""wing"" star in Booker and wanted to build around him. Ayton was the Arizona Star that was projected Number 1 by almost ALL draft sites.... Suns picking Ayton was DESTINY.   its either Luka or Booker... I cannot imagine both would compliment each other as Booker is NOT a 3-D player. He can play off the ball but he thrives next to a proper PG. Luka is a European Lebron/Harden... you need a specific team around him also. Booker and Doncic would put up nice stats together but that team would be vulnerable back court from a defensive stand point. Besides, Booker at the time (2018) was being built-up to play like Harden... so he was going to be playing the lead ball handler a lot.... it failed badly.  In any case... Ayton was the ABSOLUTE pick for the Suns back then considering Booker was looked at as the combo guard scorer and play maker. Its either Booker or Doncic...."
"If he doesn't improve at all then yes, it's the worst contract.   Love has 2 years and $60M left, Wall has 2 years and $92M left, whereas Porzingis has 3 years and $101.5M left.  What makes Porzingis' contract the worst of those, is that the Rockets and Cavs aren't in a position to bring over highly coveted free agents. Their focus right now is on player development, so the Love/Wall contracts aren't really bringing them down.  But for the Mavericks, by having Porzingis effectively locked into the next 3 years, they are in the worst position of the 3 teams. The reason being Luka Doncic. Porzingis' contract screws over Dallas trying to build around Doncic to start his career and it'd be a very difficult contract to unload somewhere as things stand."
"The Mavs are just Luka Doncic, Jazz are a legit team its not an equivalent comparison."
Luka Doncic
"Hmm, come to think of it, none of the players are female or head coaches either.  It's time for the Mavs to be leaders and find Luka Doncic a co-star from the WNBA."
That player?  Luka Doncic
"I think he's atleast top 2 behind Lebron since 2017-18. He's been doing  what Doncic does right now, but better, but got slandered for it, while Luka gets praised. Idc about people rambling about him joining the Nets, i wanna see him get his ring. He deserves it"
"Oh stop: They said that about Steph Curry, James  harden, Trae young , etc. Offense and defense are not equally weighted. YES, talent = scoring. Especially in today’s game.   One of the best defenders of his time (Kawhi) can’t stop Luka Doncic or donovan Mitchell from averaging 40 a game. It’s a different game my man. I can call for a screen and get the matchup I want. There’s a handful of defenders who supercede that and can still make an impact….Mikail Bridges is not one of them btw"
Vlade: Drafts Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic even though Joerger was begging him to take Luka.  Joerger: Creates an offense that maximizes Bagley's strengths as well as Fox and Hield and the Kings have their best season in 13 years.  Vlade: Fires Joerger and replaces him with Luke Walton.   Still doesn't make any sense.
"Suns fan here. I about had a stroke when they passed on Luka. You think this team is good? Imagine having Paul, Booker, and Doncic on the floor to close out games."
"Luka Doncic will end up being fool's gold for the franchise he plays for. He'll put up his godly numbers and look like greatest of all time, but his style and the heliocentric offense around him makes anyone who already isn't a role player worse. No stars will want to come play him because they will have to take a back seat to him."
"Bagley was the #1 recruit out of high school and averaged 21/11 at Duke. I think it's easy to forget how much more bigs were still valued just three years ago. Here's a mock draft with Bagley going second.  &gt;Some speculation persists as to what the Kings will decide to do here, but there’s a level of skepticism that Sacramento will actually roll the dice on Michael Porter without first trading down, an option they continue to explore. Although members of their braintrust recently went to Spain to see Luka Doncic again, the Kings are still thought to be lukewarm and looking at frontcourt help. Of the available bigs, Bagley is the most likely to produce early in his career, and given the pressure to find production after their past draft struggles, it feels like the Kings will go this route if they don’t find a preferable deal to move down. Given that many teams view this draft as having a strong top group of seven or eight prospects, there may be less incentive than usual to give up a significant return to move into this spot. The best bet here is the Kings end up staying put and going with Bagley.  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/04/19/nba-mock-draft-2018"
"I think what happened is that a lot of nba fans wrote Ayton off because of how good Doncic was day 1. The funny thing is that Doncic was always an already finished product and that was the whole hype over him, he played with mens and dominated. Now that Ayton is becoming what we expected him to be the gap between the two is becoming smaller and smaller. From an offense standpoint ofc Luka is still the better player but that Ayton defense is no joke and it's something that's always underrated in most sports. I believe that with another jump next year, they could be legit comparable in value even tho the media will keep talking about Luka and not Ayton.  Then you had Booker who was all alone but was clearly a fringe superstar/top tier star. Add Chris paul a floor general who made every single team he played for instantly better and worst when he left them. + an amazing bench + roleplayers and you end up with a very legit team. Really curious to see who would win in a suns vs jazz match if that happens."
"Looks like it.  About halfway down [this page](https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/sports/photos-what-sneakers-nba-players-are-wearing-this-season/collection_1b7135ce-8e53-11eb-a01b-e39f6da49ed3.html#51), there's a photo of Jokic's shoes with a ring on his laces.

(ctrl+F for ""shoelaces"")"
"This is why it helps to have an owner who’s somewhat knowledgeable about Basketball. A big reason why the Mavs made that trade to get Doncic with no fear is that Cuban knows some stuff about basketball and knows how well Luka had done in Europe. Most owners would’ve been like “Who the fook is that guy?”.  Double edged sword though. If they know a little bit about basketball, they may still fall into the Dunning Kruger effect and think they know more than they actually do and get too involved."
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."
"Basketball is a very forgivable sport when it comes to athleticism with a low skill level. In terms of technical application, Giannis and Siakam are probably more skilled in football than they are in basketball. But both were graced with great athleticism, Giannis has chosen to hone his body while Siakam has tried to improve his skill.   Giannis is probably the least sophisticated league MVP i have ever watched, and this lack of sophistication will always limit him from his true potential. Both Siakam and Giannis started playing basketball in their teens and it shows.   I don't really know how you develop athletes in America. But in the country i was raised we played organized sports from 6-12 with a focus on the development of fundementals, 13-18 with focus tactics and development IQ and athleticism.   Think about this at the age Giannis started playing basketball in an organized fashion, Luka Doncic had already been scouted by a foreign Academy team and was competing internationally. This is not meant as a slight at Giannis and Siakam in any fashion.  In other sports like Soccer for example it simply not possible to start at age 14 unless you are infused in a pick playing culture like Brazil or some African countries and go on to become an MVP. And i highly doubt he played large amounts of pick-up games either, if he did his skill level would be higher."
"Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard are all better so no. I would say Jokic is better too. Joel Embiid and Luka Doncic have a great argument too."
Except defense and boxing out.  Kawhi literally opened game 7 up getting easy rebounds because Doncic couldn't or wouldn't box him out.  He also scored on Doncic quite easily.  A conversation people never wanna have about Luka.
"You're delusional if you think current Damian Lillard &amp; Luka Doncic aren't better than 22-year-old Derrick Rose.  I love Derrick Rose but if you slot him (his 2011 MVP self) into the current Blazers/Mavericks teams, those 2 teams aren't doing jack shit."
"&gt; Doncic went into a Mavericks teams that has consistency.  sure the only thing we’ve consistently done is lost in the first round. lmao like What? you obviously don’t watch our games, we were carried by Dirk and now they’re expecting Luka to hard carry the same way.   &gt; Their starts to their careers are so drastically different.   Huh, it couldn’t possibly be just because Luka’s a better player? That’s just completely out of the realm of possibility I guess."
"Why would every disadvantage not also apply to the Lakers?  And what's your source for your claim that everyone was checked out? *Plenty* of players seemed like the exact opposite, like they were totally locked in. See: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Nikola Jokic, etc  Like it honestly seems like you completely just pulled that out of your ass because one or two players voiced their struggles, no offense"

Divac messed up the kings bad why 1 because he could have drafted luka however most people don't realize this when buddy heild got traded to sac for cousin's  new Orleans  offered 2 firsts the kings said no and 3 weeks later divac took the deal for only 1 st rounder well that other first became zion williamson  so the kings technicaly  would have a starting lineup of  Pg fox  Sg heild  Sf doncic  Pf zion  C Holmes   Talk about a legit team and would be one of the top 5 nba teams  plus we most likely wouldn't have signed Barnes to a 20 mill deal heild would have signed for much lower and most likely we would have a big time center since everyone would have been on rc deals
Annoint Luka Doncic and Donovan Mitchell. Next series is Booker. Then finals would be KD. Anoooint fuckn everyone

"well I'd say while cards tend to sell for more in general than jerseys, there arent really that many more million dollar cards. There have only been like 15 cards that have sold for more than a million and only 5 of those were multi millions. fewer than 40 cards ever have been sold for 500k. there are jerseys from guys like babe ruth and don larson that have sold for millions, as have one of muhammad ali's gloves  also interestingly enough, it seems like the market has really exploded recently, since 24 of the top 25 biggest card sales ever have taken place in 2020 or 2021, and for relatively new players like Giannis, Mike Trout, Luka Doncic, Patrick Mahomes etc.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_sports_cards"

"&gt; 1999 Lakers? didn't even have 3 All-Stars  Shaq, Kobe, Glenn Rice. And you can't go with ""He doesn't count because he wasn't an all-star that year, even though he had been the three previous years"", since with Detroit you emphasized how that exact year wasn't as important as the years leading up to it.  &gt; 3 established stars acquired through trades/FA is a superteam.   Why are we suddenly pretending there's no difference between a star and a superstar?  Nick Vucevic, Julius Randle, and Paul George would not be a superteam.  Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard would be."
"Depends what you mean tier 1. Like, is he as good as KD or Kawhi? Hell no. He choked way too many times to be in that group.  So if those guys are tier 1, Harden is tier 2 with 3-4 more players imo.  Like KD = Kawhi &gt;&gt; Steph = Giannis = Harden = LeBron = Jokic &gt;&gt; Embiid = Luka = Doncic. That's how I'd rank them"

What about Bogdonavic? And didn’t they draft Luka Doncic too?
Luka Doncic
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
"You need to be more than just a capable passer. A lot of players are capable passers, but for someone like Mitchell, you need to be a great passer and playmaker if he's not going to impact the game on defense.  When AD commands the ball in the post, he's controlling the pace of the game. He can be a matchup nightmare. But he impacts the game both offensively and defensively at an elite level.   Donovan Mitchell torching bad defenses isn't him taking over when shit hits the fan. Prior to this playoffs, he had 2 good playoff series and 2 bad playoff series. The 2 good playoff series came against teams with bigs that aren't good at defending the PnR, who utilize drop coverage (Adams and Jokic). In the 2 other series against Houston Mitchell played poorly because of Houstons switching defense. No superstar averages 19 and 21 ppg on 34% FG and 25% 3 PT against a Houston defense that lacked superb elite perimeter defenders. We give him a pass for being the lone offensive creator, but it doesn't mean he's a superstar. Contrast this to Luka Doncic who absolutely destroyed a Clippers defense that is most geared to defend players like him. There's your difference."
"It's the ability to control the game with more than just scoring.  Yes he's an elite scorer, but can he command an offense, command the pace, draw double teams and manipulate defenses on a consistent basis? When shit hits the fan can you give the ball to Mitchell when defenses are iron tight and he can make things happen?  It's not about achievement as much as it is just pure ability to play. That is why AD (even before the championship), Luka Doncic now with two straight first round exists, are considered superstars. It's why Jokic was considered a superstar years ago."
"Eh, in g1, he tried something different, trapping Luka early, but since then it was all: sub out Zubac, let Doncic feast on Reggie/Rondo and hope he doesn't destroy them."
Luka Doncic is my husband
"&gt;Luka is definitely on the same level as Harden offensively  Harden has 76% TS this playoffs while Doncic has 55.6% TS, Harden is clearly the better play offensively and i really don't see how this is a debate right now. He might reach Harden's level one day but he definitely isn't there yet."
"This is a bit unfair to Luka. Mitchell is a star no doubt, but he also has a better structured team around him. Luka needed to explode at the beginning of every game, and that tires players out. This was a fantastic game from Mitchell, but he did make some key mistakes in the final minutes too as with Doncic (if I am being extremely nitpicky)."
Luka Doncic sends his regards
Doncic gets gassed in the 4th. U guys need 2nd offensive playmaker and luka needs to work on his conditioning
"Clippers went from facing Luka Doncic to Donovan Mitchell.       This is going to be a fun series."

"I'm not so sure about that. Like I said these are private entities. You can't ask someone to pay taxes on something that only exists on paper and they can't reliably liquidate.  Like right now, if you were to work as an engineer at Robinhood, you would get equity as part of you compensation (you'd actually buy it, but let's just say it's given). That equity is worth nothing because you can't really sell. It's all about IPO hopes. It's like how that artist got $250M from painting Facebook's office and getting paid only in shares. Facebook was big at the time, but how was anyone supposed to know the ""true"" value? What was he supposed to pay taxes on exactly?  I assume the situation would be similar for NBA ownership shares. After all, the shares would be issued on some estimated valuation. Just because we think the Mavs are worth 2.5B, doesn't mean they are. How are you going to tax for that? Is the government supposed to tell the Luka Doncic how much his ownership stake is worth? How are they supposed to know? This isn't like property tax where you're always getting the land value appraised. It's only worth whatever it is sold at. Anything before that is unrealized gains/value.  Then again I could be wrong. I've never been given any Mavs equity for labor, and I'm not a tax lawyer either."
After Luka Doncic and Rick Carlisle everything else seems like a breeze
This game shows me that Zubac can actually be quite dominating and useful in playoffs.   And that Luka Doncic is fucking insane how he singlehandledly almost played a huge offensive threat against Clippers.
Idk why he even trashtalking in first place.  They took 7 games to beat Luka doncic while down 3-0 and you're gonna talk that smack 2 minutes in while down 10-2 and Mitchell torching yall?   Weak tech but still an easily avoidable one if he shut his mouth up
john collins is a walmart porzingis like how trae young is a walmart luka doncic
I thought they were chanting “Luka Doncic” and was hella confused lol
"People will hate what you said, but I also like players who get the most out of what they’re genetically given.

"This Season Performance:   Jokic  Harden  Curry  Doncic  Kawhi  Lebron  KD  Embiid  Giannis  Lillard  Overall Sentiment as Players:   Curry  Harden  Lebron  KD  Jokic  Luka  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Lillard  \---I think Lebron is finally at the point where he can't just come and prove everyone wrong. The way he was playing towards the end was genuinely concerning. I was one of those who never believed Kawhi/Steph/KD was better in 2019. But it feels like in terms of his scoring, its been a step by step process of declining."
"Yeah, the next time Luka Doncic enters the draft he's definitely going #1 overall."
1. Jokic 2. Embiid 3. Giannis 4. Kawhi 5. Chris Paul 6. Luka Doncic 7. Damian Lillard  8. Steph Curry 9. LeBron James 10. Trae Young  •Julius Randle’s poor playoff performance had him missing the cut
"/r/Suns fucking *hated* him this year until around March or so, he was scapegoated for literally every loss. They'll downvote me and pretend that they've been fair with him but the fans have been pretty disappointed with the lack of 'Luka Doncic' in his game and they've honestly never forgiven him for it"
"&gt; team now so you could have a lineup like Cp3 Doncic Booker, Crowder, Howard  No the thread is about replacing CP3 with Luka and the assumption that Ayton would no longer be in the mix as a result. Howard worked with the Lakers because they had AD and LeBron James lol. It's not remotely the same situation.  Two-way reliable centers are not easy to replace. Part of the Suns success has been due to how well balanced they are. Jokic said himself Ayton gave him trouble and he was a big factor in the game. Take away a defensive anchor averaging an efficient 16/10 in return for more scoring and considerably worse defense I think the Suns get worse and games just become overly reliant on shootouts. CP3 is important defensively and is an all-time playmaker as well. Doncic is amazing, but to me he'd mess with what the Suns have going for themselves."
"Brooklyn actually did sign a good center they had Aldridge until he retired, Pretty sure what he is saying is that if you had doncic instead of Ayton you could always find another center whether it be a veteran minimum like a Dwight Howard or someone to fill the role that Ayton has right now, yea you wouldn’t get the same production obviously as Ayton but we’re talking about Luka being on the team now so you could have a lineup like Cp3 Doncic Booker, Crowder, Howard as an example"

Yet Doncic hasn't even been the best playoff scorer during his two playoff years.  |Rk|Player|PTS|2P%|3P%|FT%|TS%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Luka Doncic|33.5|.554|.392|.600|.582| |2|Donovan Mitchell|33.5|.522|.475|.933|.666|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 6/8/2021.
"Sigh... so many of you didn't watch more than 2 Mavs games this season I wager.  When the season started, Doncic had to take on quite a burden due to COVID and injury. As the primary playmaker, he had to try to get people involved, and yet so many of his usual options were out. Hence, he was inefficient. The team suffered as a result, with a dramatic 14th place in the West being its lowest point.  As the team got healthier, Luka not only regained his shooting touch, but he also began experimenting getting everyone involved. There were plenty of games he'd allow Brunson or Richardson run plays, and when KP returned he actively sought to involve KP in plays. Coming back from injury, that had mixed results. There were games that KP was on fire from 3 and Luka racked up assists. There were games that KP felt energy and had some sweet cuts and dunks. And there were games that he was a highly inefficient option.   It should not be forgotten that while he got blocks, KP was a liability on defense because he still lacked speed.  In any case, with the playoffs fast approaching, I feel like Luka and Rick already decided on the players deemed reliable options, and unfortunately KP was not all that reliable. THJ turned into the second option. DFS was the mainstay starter. All other roles were interchangeable depending on their play. And so, KP got stuck in that rut. Too much of a star to accept the flexibility needed in Rick's system, too much of a rhythm shooter to thrive in that kind of a scenario, but too valuable to leave on the bench in crucial games.  Luka has to find him more, but I can imagine that there is not much trust there. This needs to be built up throughout the offseason and early on next season. Still possible to salvage the roster. Still workable. But I cannot blame Luka too much for what happened. It's a byproduct of COVID, injuries, a shortened season, and KP's lack of offball and post play development."
"Definitely classy Luka Doncic or Nikola Jokic, I don't know what it is about them but they deserve everything that the NBA can give them. We don't want what happened to Steve Nash and John Stockton to repeat"
Luka Doncic all day
"Luka ""Black Hole"" Doncic"
"I always thought the clippers could come back because they are just more talented than the mavericks overall even if luka doncic can be the best player in the series  Bucks are not more talented than the nets, they got no chance.  They needed to steal one of the first 2 games to have a chance and instead they rolled over and got blown out.  They look confused on both ends of the floor, their offense is pathetic.  Their defense is pathetic."

"Luka is about as pass first as Harden is. Which you see he is willing to pass but then when you factor in the ridiculous shots they take, then pass first seems kinda silly. Chris Paul is pass first, Lebron James is pass first. Doncic and Harden are just great passers with a great basketball IQ, not pass first."
"The UK has only ever qualified twice, as a wealthy nation of 60+ million people. Luka Doncic and an NBA-level end-of-bench player is honestly great production.  (We went 1-7 in 1948, and 1- 4 in 2012, wasting good Luol Deng years)"

What's most intriguing to me about Luka is that it doesn't seem like he's peaking at all. He shot 49% from the field and 53% from the FT line in the playoffs this year. Seemed like he was taking ill-advised shots at time. Sloppy turnovers. Obviously terrible at the FT line. And in 13 career playoff games - all vs a team designed to stop such players with the size and skill of Doncic - Luka is putting up 34/10/9. Averaging. *Averaging.* AVERAGING. The guy is averaging 34/10/9 vs Kawhi/PG and the Clippers in the playoffs. Kawhi is a 2x Finals MVP. Does he have one career playoff game where he put up at least 34/10/9?
&gt;PG - Trae Young   &gt;   &gt;SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   &gt;   &gt;SF - Luka Doncic   &gt;   &gt;PF - Michael Porter Jr.   &gt;   &gt;C - Deandre Ayton  IDK I still think Brooklyn is scoring 199 pts on that team 4 out of 7 times.
"There have been many players, specifically guards that have been hidden over the years as they are not good defenders. Steve Nash and Steph Curry immediately jump to mind. He’s bigger but Luka Doncic same..  Simply if the team can see upside in their strengths, they will make it work."
"At the time, there was a general consensus that the No. 2 pick was going to be either Darko Milicic or Carmelo Anthony, and folks were quite split between the two. Similar to many, many prospects who've come through over the years (foreign or otherwise), there was the pretty solid belief and expectation that Darko was a gem and monster pivot in the making.   The debate mostly centered around whether you wanted someone who'd proven they could already perform on the big stage (Anthony) or the swift-moving center with A+ potential who may need some time to grow (Milicic was still 17 a week prior to the draft).   To give a feel for how certain of a top pick Darko was, [here's an ESPN The Magazine cover from *before* the draft](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ksezwy34L._SR600%2C315_PIWhiteStrip%2CBottomLeft%2C0%2C35_SCLZZZZZZZ_FMpng_BG255%2C255%2C255.jpg).  It's hard to think of a modern parallel because so much has changed in the way we scout international prospects (largely because of failures like Milicic and Nikoloz Tskitishvili). But the Darko hype was somewhat similar to the Luka Doncic draft hype and perhaps the Kristaps Porzingis hype prior. The difference being, teams have since learned to delve much deeper into international scouting, beyond ""this dude's individual workout for us was amazing and he has the body of a Greek god"". Now we often have a better idea of who's *really* going to translate well from overseas when it comes to picking that high (though busts still remain).   [Here's a fun piece on all the pre-draft Darko hype.](https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2014/9/24/6841293/rip-hamilton-reaction-darko-milicic-2003-nba-draft)  One way or another, guys like Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade were universally slotted outside of the top-3. It was always going to be LeBron James, then Carmelo Anthony and Darko Milicic in some form or fashion.   And for what it's worth, as a Pistons fan, I can say they've received plenty of mockery and criticism for their selection over the years, though it may have been blunted by the fact they won an NBA championship against long odds Darko's rookie year."
Suns in 6 versus bucks. Finals MVP: Chris Paul —-Lakers in 5 versus bucks. Finals MVP: Lebron James  Bucks in 7 versus Lakers Finals MVP: Giannis  ———-Spurs in 7 over Pistons Finals MVP: Kawhi Leonard Mavs in 7 over Pistons Finals MVP: Luka Doncic
"Yes. Then trade Booker for Pick 2 and have Doncic and Ayton. That was my trade proposal back in 2018 anyways and Suns sub voted me down.  But looking back, I wont change a thing. Suns are in WCF, with CP3, Monty being CRITICAL to that journey... both of these two would not be on the Suns if Suns picked Luka and built a team around him and Booker.... Suns would be battling for 7th to 9th seed."
"Without context, sure, but I think its a bit naïve to believe Doncic wouldn't immediately elevate this Suns team, even with how good Ayton has been  Its a silly conversation anyways, this would be a very different team if they picked Luka, I doubt they'd even have CP3. Still think they'd be an absolute juggernaut with him regardless"
Why're they not accosting Luka Doncic for the exact same thing?
"I'm not backing on my words. I was one of those who thought CP3 deal wasnt the best one (I envisioned this year being a playoff exploration for Ayton , Booker and Bridges)  If i'm Sarver back at the draft night I'll draft Ayton , If i'm McFerry in a fantasy draft with no team I'm picking Luka.  I'll try to think about this like NBA 2k ratings. How many backcourt players have 9x rating.  (Quick check 16 players90+ the bigs are Zion, AD, Jokic, Embiid, Giannis, that means 11 ""smalls"")  That tells me that in comparision a 88 in the paint might be more valuable than a 90 in the perimeter. Even more if you already have a cornerstone in the perimeter.  We had Booker at the time and whole org belived in him so you build arround your franchise player.  Is Luka better than Ayton? Yes by a big margin. Is Luka what Phoenix needed considering Ayton (The bigs we had , the lack of top tier bigs and the position our already franchise players plays in) No. It was Ayton.  You can make a case, me I'll take Ayton and go out finding a PG instead playing Booker/Doncic sharing PG-SG and going out trying to find a high mid-tier big like Capela or similars."
"This guy knows it, Luka Doncic Nurkic. I got his name wrong."
"I have such a hard time putting this all together. Like the rumors are Luka was clashing with Carlisle, which happens I get that. But then Luka doesn't have any input on the new coach? If Luka clashed with Carlisle then why was Nelson pushed out? It was reported that Doncic liked him.  It's so hard to follow who likes who, who supports who. I wish it was just ""Luka wanted his guy. Cuban is letting Luka help with the coaching search so he will sign the extension."" Instead it seems like the organization is blowing up and no one is happy. At least make the superstar happy if you're going to toss your HoF coach."
"Redraft of 2018:  Suns: Luka Doncic, Ayton is a beast but imagine having Luka and Booker being your core for the next 10 years  Kings: Trae Young  Hawks: DeAndre Ayton"
"If he is I apologize for not knowing more. He’s just not Trae Young or Luka Doncic, that’s he joke"
https://www.wsj.com/articles/vassilis-spanoulis-luka-doncic-giannis-antetokounmpo-11611903134
I think he’ll be good for the Mavs for two reasons - attracting free agents that want to play under him and connecting to Luka Doncic.
"Listen I see how aggravating that must’ve been. I watched your games actually. I was very much on the Trae train in his rookie year and called out a lot of guys who were saying stupid shit about how and/or Doncic and was rooting for Trae to show Luka up.  It’s probably no skin off your back, but it’s way harder to root for the Hawks/Trae to do well when I know the result will be Hawks fans diminishing Tatum and other guys I like. And Tatum had absolutely nothing to do with the trade and was actually drafted a year before."
"&gt; You're right though, I think if Trae is zipping the ball out to open shooters similar to how Doncic does it when teams help, this game maybe goes a little different.  Trae is legit really good at this in general but having a couple more inches would make his life so much easier in these situations, let alone being 6'8 like Luka . In these split second decisions having to worry less about how to get the ball over and past the defense and just seeing more of the court at a better angle is a significant advantage . I would say Trae shouldnt rush and try these passes cause it would still be a significantly higher TO pass for him if he is forced to do them play after play. Trae has a tight handle and is small so i think he should keep his dribble for 1-2 seconds more until a safer oppening is available or even decide to attack the center,  even if a riskier pass earlier was available for an open shot"
Doncic is leaving. Please don't leave Luka.
Fuck sake. I was afraid this was going to happen  &gt;Doncic has specifically avoided meddling in the front office decision-making  Also I hope this puts to fucking rest this dumb idea Luka is staging some coup to get Donnie and Carlisle out

Luka Doncic
"If Cam Reddish has the potential to be an all star, literally anyone in the league can be called that. It would be a meaningless designation. Yes, he's breathing and a professional basketball player so I guess he has a theoretical chance some day.     But the odds are infinitesimal because his growth curve sucks. A few good games in your first two years mean nothing when you have a 9.03 PER rookie year, have eight months off to get better, and then put up a 9.36 PER. He is an inefficient player who actually found a way to shoot worse in his second year than his first.  And not just about anybody who actually watches him play would agree with you.   Here's The Athletic's ranking of the top 50 players on their rookie deals from February: https://theathletic.com/2375978/2021/02/25/zion-williamson-luka-doncic-trae-young-nba-young-talent-rankings-top-10/  Where is Cam Reddish listed? 46th behind ""potential"" all star Marvin Bagley Jr!  There's probably no player in NBA history who has had as two bad of seasons as Cam Reddish and made an all star team. So labeling him the way you do just shows a complete lack of perspective.  Cam Reddish will never be in the top one precent of active basketball players. Seems like so glaringly obvious of a statement but feel free to keep arguing because he was once a minus three in the supposed game of his life against one of the worst defenses in the league. That's definitely enough.   Coby White scored thirty in three straight games once and I would call anyone who said he was a potential all star a moron."
Luka would never have 9 turnovers!  Edit: [Lol apparently he had 11 against the Clippers last year in the Bubble.](https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Luka-Doncic/Bests/54148)

Its other way around. Then Luka had rocky start this season Hawks fans were spamming this subreddit with post about Trae and Doncic. Also don't know if you read nba twitter but Trae stans get defensive out there.
"Again being covered by Simmons and Thybulle isn’t being covered by Kawhi. I also find it funny that the same Hawks fans spending a week telling us how trash Simmons is, is now acting like he is the second coming of Gary Payton.   The point I was making was that Doncic torched anyone not named Kawhi and Trae didn’t show that. That doesn’t mean that Trae is bad it just means he ain’t Luka Doncic. But who the fuck is?"
"Doncic and it's not even remotely close.   These 2 derive 95%++ of their value from offense, so let's just focus on that.   Most of AI's value on offense comes from his scoring, and Doncic does that better (in a much more competitive era, where the average talent level is higher). and is even slightly more efficient in the playoffs. It's easy to see why - Luka's size just allows him to get much easier buckets more consistently, and he can shoot well enough.   When you factor in playmaking is simply where Luka blows him away. He creates way more opportunities for his teammates than AI (due to his better scoring), and can simply make passes that AI can't, plus is a much more willing passer.   The narratives around   * ""But AI won an MVP!"" - yes, but Shaq/Duncan were far, far FAAAR better players that year; if you actually followed the league back then + looked back with a critical eye you'd know this * ""But he led the Sixers to the Finals singlehandedly!"" - that was definitely NOT single-handed; they were built mostly on defense and Iverson's inefficient volume scoring was just enough to get them to squeeze past teams. Think LeBron's early Cavs teams (except those were up against much better competition and were actually above average on O when LeBron was on the court). The comparison with Luka's team is actually laughable; the Clippers are simply a much better team than any AI had to face that playoffs  Are just, that baseless narratives that have no relevance to this debate. That game where he stopped the Lakers' perfect run makes this run look WAY better than it actually was."
Peak AI won MVP. Luka Doncic hasn't.  Also I think comparing the TS% is misleading as heck because Iverson was always notoriously inefficient when looking at those types of stats. It really makes his impact look worse than it was.
"Luka ""50-40-60 club"" Doncic"
"Are you sure? I'm pretty much a neutral fan here and it sure did feel like it to me, and Lue definitely highlighted this as the strategy multiple times throughout interviews and the game itself, don't think that it would be hard to find comments about it... It feels like even Mavs (Luka/Carlisle/etc) itself talked about it on their postgame interviews too. Example from Lue himself:  &gt; [Ty Lue said that, yep, the game plan is to make Luka ""a scorer and try to take the other guys out.""   &gt; He felt Game 3 was a ""step forward"" in limiting everyone else around Doncic.](https://twitter.com/AndrewGreif/status/1398699771116797955)"
"hey now, Hollins correctly identified Luka Doncic as the best player in his draft class back when that wasn't such a popular opinion. He at least has that going for him on his track record, compared to Max, who I can't really remember having any good take. Also at least Hollins played in the league, even if it was as a bench warmer you still gotta respect his pov to some extent for having first-hand league experience which none of us have."
RemindMe! 4 years  Luka Doncic is no longer a member of the Dallas Mavericks after forcing his way out for being unhappy. The Mavs fan base is disgusted and can’t believe they considered him to be “Dirk 2.0”
"Look kid, I don’t know how subtle you think you’re being, but it’s pretty clear you’re a die hard Luka fan and I’ve gotten you pretty flustered.   “Bu- but.. L-Luka shot 1% better this y-year”   We are discussing who the better overall shooter was.  Again, if your argument is that Luka shooting *1%* better this year equates to him being a better overall shooter, ill let you be deluded in peace (you are embarrassing yourself lol) there are so many more variables to take into account. Talk about grasping at straws. At first it was the better overall shooter, then you move the goal posts upon getting proved wrong? Laughable. You sir are fanboy with tunnel vision   Zach Lavine shot a higher % overall from 3, AND a higher % from 25+ feet, on MORE volume than Irving, Heild, Harden, Young, Doncic, Bogdanonvic, Tatum, Hardaway. Who in their right mind would say Zach is a better shooter than everyone on that list? Maybe like 3 of them?. This is why you don’t go by a single season. If we went by this season alone, we would have to conclude that CJ and Kyrie are better shooters than Dame.   It’s a little sad that you have to hyper fixate in on a **1%** difference in a single season, because the stats show Trae is the better shooter for his career.  Trae shoots better for his career by almost every metric you can find. Sorry dude, but that’s checkmate."
"I mean no shit. You wouldn't even need to take anywhere close to that much height off. Even being a few inches shorter would put a lot of NBA players out of the league.   But you could say that about any player not just bigs. You take a 6'8"" 3-and-D wing and make him 6'4"" and he becomes a mediocre guard. You take a 6'2"" PG and make him 5'10"" and you have a G-leaguer.  Sure a 6'8"" Embiid or Jokic wouldn't be too impressive, but Klay Thompson at 6'2"" is a slower JJ Redick. Luka Doncic at 6' 3"" is a slower Jose Calderon. Trae Young at 5'9"" would never get his shot off."
"They don't understand how the league works. All new coaches have to be white fresh faces or ex players who put in work (if Black) and have personalities they can rally behind.  (Not @ you) NBA people live in a different universe. They don't give a shit about things that happened 20 years ago or a DUI.  Stop pretending you live on the same standard of behavior as multi millionaire global celebrities. Just because Kidd's behavior might render you expendable at your 80,000 salary job (of which you can get another if you're truly skilled) doesn't mean LeBron James or Luka Doncic cares the same way"
"Have you watched Luka Doncic play? He's the goddamn system, like a Lebron or a Harden, and he's being doing it better than a vast majority of players."

"&gt;KP doesn't fit with doncic.  The offensive numbers when he shares the court with Luka say otherwise. He allows Dallas to play 5 out which completely opens up the floor for Luka to get into the paint and kick or score.  &gt;injury prone  He's played more games than Kemba the past two years.  &gt;something more valuable to the franchise.  Kemba wouldn't be more valuable lol. He is 5 years older than KP, is worse defensively and less efficient as a scorer.

Dallas would rather let KP have his first full offseason healthy to train and see what he looks like next year."
"Jokic was doing some crazy things too, he just had an awful team around him. Giannis is putting up nearly 30 point triple doubles nearly every game.

Ya but the most mocks before the lottery is established just ignore the teams and pick the order they think they will go. Like the mock posted abouve from SI was before the lottery. Here is [another one](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/03/13/2018-nba-mock-draft-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-headline-loaded-class/417675002/) before the lottery that had Ayton number 1. [Here](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2018-nba-mock-draft-oklahomas-trae-young-slips-out-of-top-10/) is one that had Bagley 1 and Ayton 2.
I will start the bidding at one Luka Doncic
"It will be close. Obviously you take Ayton over Hakeem, Bagley and Bowie is a wash, you take Trae over MJ, and Mikal Bridges over John Stockton. Only weak point is Charles Barkley being better than his equivalent of Luka Doncic."
LMAO at “stupidly said Doncic is better”     Give Luka the Hawks supporting cast and they’d be the favorites in the East. Give me a break with this recency bias.
"Are you joking? Did you even watch the series? Of course he guarded Doncic, not all game, but for a significant amount of time, especially later in the series. Doncic still got his. I agree with you though that the Clippers' interior defense is shit. Too bad nobody on the Mavs outside of Luka and Boban for stretches could exploit that.  Again Trae is great, but I just don't see him at the same level as Luka, and I usually have no problem admitting when someone's playing better than one of my favorites. You don't think swapping Trae for Luka straight up right now wouldn't make the Hawks a better team?"

Cade has already mentioned that he watches a lot of Luka footage, so he’s probably aware how similar they are when it comes to having “slow” first steps."
"Search for any post made on this sub in the last few days and I'd say it's the case. Here's from like the last 24 hours:   &gt;True or False: Trae and Ayton give you wins, Doncic gives you highlights  #  &gt;If Trae leads Hawks to the title would Mavs fans regret the trade? Or are they so effected by Luka All NBA selections, Larry Bird Lebron James comparisions, ESPN hype, top 10 All time potential talks that they would still believe they got the better player?  #  &gt;After the playoffs so far who do you think actually won the the Luka and trae trade. Hawks or mavs.  And well yeah I guess it comes off as somewhat defensive of Luka even if I think this is true for all stars in the league. I said the same last season when Giannis got shit on for the Bucks not managing to win with Heat triple teaming him."
Counterpoint. Aytons game hasn't fully blossomed yet because he has taken a step back to meet the teams needs rather than just build up his game.  There's things he could do that would take his game to an elite level that he doesn't do because the Suns don't need him too.  So the supporting cast goes both ways. It gets Ayton more team success but he has nowhere near the usage of Luka. If Ayton has Luka's usage rate he could easily be a 30/15 guy like an Embiid.  Ayton averaged 14/10 with literally half the Usage rate of Doncic (36 vs 18) this year
&gt;Also luka make way more passes. This season trae averaged 57.4 passes per game and luka averaged 64.1 passes per game. So for trae young the passes are lot more likely to transfer to assists.  How does this imply Trae is a better passer? What if his teammates are simply more likely to make the shot?   &gt;Lastly this is the most important point. Through just simple eye test trae young make a lot more passes to the interior than luka doncic.  Trae has two of the biggest lob threats in the NBA. Also why are passes to the interior inherently a better indicator of passing ability?   I'm not sure who is a better passer but some of your arguments are hard to follow.
Luka Doncic we coming for you n..
"The absolute scenes when Ayton and Trae make it to the finals before the ""best of the three"" Luka Doncic lmfao."
"Sorry you started calling me a ""fucking clown"" and ended crying ""troll"" haha, you were so hot and bothered from the start.  About Luka Doncic joke too haha. Im not worried about how i look here. You should probably have better manners"
"Tony Parker, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan  Baron Davis, Manu Ginobili, Luka Doncic, David Lee, Matt Bonner"
Doncic is Westbrook. Trae is a Curry/Nash team first player .    Both are great players but Trae is more willing to sacrifice for team glory while Luka prioritizes his stats and ices out his teammates.
Luka doncic?
"I lol’d. “Intensify”?!? Tha fuck. He said if he WINS A CHAMPIONSHIP. Without an all star cast. If Trae Young WINS A CHAMPIONSHIP he is better than Luka Doncic idgaf how many triple doubles and Hollywood smiles into the camera Luka does. And better then dame Lillard, and James harden,  whole rack of players. With new information comes new decision making. We would all have to adjust.   Ans it’s not even like the stats arent there either. Trae has been putting up 28 and 10 we all assumed it was ‘empty stats’ well again we would need to adjust. He’d pass a ton of guys. He would have beat a fully healthy Embiid and Giannis (!!), and probably Booker. The only players I’d feel comfortable saying are better would be KD, Bron, Steph."
"&gt; no. stop. address why i brought him up. are you saying he is an elite shooter ""like steph curry"".  I brought Steph Curry up because this generations elite PG shooter is Curry. Bob Cousey shot like 35% from the field, should I compare Luka to him instead?   &gt;luka has to either shoot like steph, the best shooter ever, or be as good at defense as arguably the best perimeter defensive player ever in his defensive prime in MJ to be considered top 10 (potentially).  That is the people he is competing against the top. You think Tim Duncan wasn't good at defense? You think Hakeem didn't know how to get buckets? All the people at the top have multiple elite skills and Luka doesn't have one to overcome the fact he is a turnstile on defense despite people saying ""he is better on that end this year, trust me"" every year similar to what people said with Kanter every year.  Magic had way better TS than Doncic in his era. If you play that game, than the detroit pistons have a better offense than the 01 Lakers that won a championship and had Koby and Shaq. In the NFL Joe Montana has never thrown more than 4000 yards in a season and is an all time great. James Winston threw for over 5000 yards in a season and got replaced the next. NFL fans understand to account for era but NBA fans blindly compare stats from now and  from forty fucking years ago with no shame and are proud when their guy ALMOST has as good numbers."
wholesome 100 big chungus luka doncic moment
"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA’s golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him “a stud” and “built different.” They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka’s play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then… right? If you’re familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you’re reading this) then you might have an idea of what’s coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there’s lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a “flopper” a “chucker” a “bitch” and a “choker.” I even found two comments that said “I hate [Harden] as a person.” (It’s odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that’s a topic I’ve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what’s different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don’t seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that’s it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, “the Mavs didn’t have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.” r/NBA doesn’t have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players."
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they’d take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De’Aaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant"
"Kawhi Leonard is better at basketball than Luka Doncic, yes."
Mavs took Luka Doncic over this guy LMAO
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/terencemoore/2020/08/24/the-dallas-mavericks-are-prospering-but-the-atlanta-hawks-still-made-right-decision-taking-trae-young-over-luka-doncic/?sh=424dc4407910  &gt; Here’s the biggest thing: Even though Young also could shoot and pass his way someday to a plaque in Springfield, Mass., the Hawks are better with Young over Doncic for more than just basketball reasons. &gt;  &gt; **It’s about demographics.** &gt;  &gt; **Young is Black.** &gt;  &gt; **Doncic isn’t.** &gt;  &gt; Atlanta is famously African American, with its background as the home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, and with its slew of hip-hop stars, and with its distinction as the hub for black entrepreneurs. &gt;  &gt; Not only that, but except for stretches during the 1980s and early 1990s, with Dominique Wilkins (a Black star and a hometown hero), the Hawks rarely have drawn well since moving from St. Louis to Atlanta in 1968. They finished 26th, 30th and 27th in average home attendance out of the NBA’s 30 teams in consecutive pre-coronavirus years through 2018-2019. &gt;  &gt; So, with the average ticket for a Hawks home game heading into last season at $105, I’m guessing Hawks officials figured in 2018 they’d have a better chance in the long run of filling all of those empty seats at State Farm Arena with a rising Black star instead of a nearly established white one. &gt;  &gt; That gamble still makes sense. &gt;  &gt; According to a 2018 Forbes.com story, Atlanta is tied with Washington D.C. as the nation’s No. 1 city in economic prosperity for Blacks."
"You’re out of your mind if you think that’s where people left it. Since the trade it has been nonstop about the Hawks making a disastrous mistake. If it was just people saying I think Luka is going to be better than Trae, then that would be fine, I probably agree. But it is just complete revisionist history to say it was that tame. It was always “the Hawks completely fucked up by not drafting Luka Doncic who is an undoubted generational talent”. Trae Young has not gotten a fair shake for a second since he joined the league just because of the trade"
"Is Trae like playoff LeBron? Is he actually a better person to have on your team than Luka Doncic, if you actually want to win in the playoffs?  (thinking of that draft)"
"I’m not going to speak for all Luka stans, but I truly do not give a fuck. Trae Young is a phenomenal player &amp; Luka Doncic is a phenomenal. I will continue to root for both players because they make the league better. I’ll let all of you guys argue everyday about who is better."
Luka foul baits just as much. It doesn't get talked about because he's the NBA's golden boy.  REGULAR SEASON CAREER:  * Trae Young : 7.4 FTA  * Luka Doncic: 7.6 FTA  PLAYOFFS CAREER:   * Trae Young : 8.8 FTA  * Luka Doncic: 8.8 FTA
"Oh god will y’all give it a rest, seriously? Both teams won the trade, and both players are the right fit for their respective teams. Trae Young is Trae Young and should be respected for his accolades/success without dragging in Luka Doncic and vice versa"
**Deandre Ayton** is a **Young Star**  **Marvin Bagley** is **Salvageable** (lol)  **Luka Doncic** is an **All-Time Great**  **Jaren Jackson Jr** is a **Future Star**  **Trae Young** is a **Playoff Stud**  mo bamba  **Wendell Carter** is **So Talented**
"Watching these conference finals, the Kyrie Irving trade was actually a good return for the Cavs. Jae Crowder is a championship level role player as seen by him starting in back to back finals on different teams. They got to take a flyer on Isaiah Thomas, but most importantly they got an unprotected pick in the 2018 draft that included Deandre Ayton (1), Luka Doncic (3), and Trae Young (5). This was a brillaint gambit by the Cavs GM, as not only could they get one of these franchise altering players, but it could have also convinced LeBron to stay if they got someone that could lead a team to the finals like Trae Young or Deandre Ayton."
Who’s beating this team:  PG: Criminal Alex Caruso  SG: K’Von Huerter  SF: Fat Luka Doncic  PF: Kevin Love  C: Nikola Jokic’s Brother
"&gt;defensive metrics don't think he's a great defender.  He was the primary perimeter defender on a top 5 defense this year, and was called upon to guard star players night in and night out.  Anyone actually watching him could tell you he was definitely good on the defensive end, regardless of defensive metrics.  &gt;below average at shooting  He shot 38% from 3 this year on over 5 attempts per game.  That's solidly above average.   His rebounding and passing could use work, no doubt.  He's not perfect.  &gt;finishing  He shot 71% at the rim this year.  For comparison, that was equal to Luka Doncic this year, and ahead of Kawhi's career average.  He doesn't even remotely have a problem finishing at the rim.    &gt;loose balls  He had 1 loose ball recovered per game this year, which was tied with guys like Kawhi, Tatum, Lowry, Curry, and Lillard.  None of those guys are known to have hustle issues.  The highest mark in the NBA was 1.3, so it wasn't like there was a huge amount of wiggle room for Wiggins there either.    &gt;screen assists  That's a matter of system, not hustle.  Players who rack up screen assists are all centers who run a lot of pnr sets.  On the Warriors, Draymond is the primary screensetter, 1) because he is the best screensetter on the Warriors, and 2) because it's the most effective way to keep him involved in the offense without his man leaving him unguarded.  Wiggins isn't the person who is called upon to set screens for primary scorers on the Warriors, which makes sense considering he's their second best scorer.  You'd either want him to be the recipient of the screen or as an option to kick out to when the ballhandler gets collapsed on.    &gt;charges  He's the primary perimeter defender.  His job is to stay with his man, contest shots, and stick with them on drives.  Not to intercept them when they've already blown by someone else."
"Just to add on, he is not maybe the most versatile defender in the NBA, he actually is. BBall Index Defensive Versatility has him first this season in versatility + second highest for the stat, with his percentage guarding each position being as close to even as you can probably get, for reference they were;  &gt; PG: 21.1% &gt; SG: 17.8% &gt; SF: 18.4% &gt; PF: 27.1% &gt; C: 15.6%  A legit 1 through 5 defender who can defend your teams best defender to great success whether it be Luka through to Embiid.  &gt; Joel Embiid:  9/33 (27%) – 51% for the season &gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo:  27/54 (50%) – 58% for the season &gt; Damian Lillard:  15/37 (40%) – 44% for the season &gt; Luka Doncic:  4/11 (36%) – 48% for the season  OG should legit be in the DPOY conversation he is that good on D, forget about all-defence which he got robbed of last year because apparently we had too many good defenders (weird how that didn't apply to the Sixers this year or Bucks last year) or this year (not enough team success which is the opposite reason he was robbed last year)."
Can't wait for the 100MM a season contract paid to Luka Doncic Jr. in 25 years.
The best player on the planet under 25 is Luka Doncic and it’s not that close imo   So whatever team he’s on
"Dude, this whole conversation is so absurd. Let's put it this way. Cade's ceiling is probably around Luka Doncic. So I would trade Luka Doncic for Embiid? Absolutely fuckin' lutely not. Have you seen a basketball game in the year 2021? A perimeter centric playmaker that can lead your whole offense is worth so much more than a limited center. Which Embiid is by the way. I don't care how great he is, positional versatility is everything in today's NBA. Embiid isn't Shaq. He isn't Hakeem. He's not good enough on his own to build an entire team around. Embiid is never gonna win the title as a number one guy. Thus why the Process was meant to add additional franchise pieces around him.  And that's not even getting into the injury history for the hundredth time."
(says the guy who is getting super triggered because someone pointed out that Luka Doncic was already a legit MVP candidate at like age 20... looooooooool)
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it’s not the league’s fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here’s a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there’s a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
&gt;Now they jump the truly shitty teams like the Kings and Magic who never get any top picks.  The Kings had the #2 pick and a chance to draft Luka Doncic three years ago.
"He is probably right up there with the best of them, maybe a tier below the best ever. He’s not some incredible athlete, but 6’8” guys with great vision and shooting don’t walk into the league very often. For playstyle comparison I’d say Luka is there and Cade has said as much himself. If they were in the same draft Cade should probably be below Doncic, but we saw how Doncic was evaluated in that draft."
"You don't have to make excuses for Luka, it's not like CP3 on the Thunder was throwing up 18 shots a game just because nobody could shoot on that team. You can still make good basketball decisions without having another star out there with you  Kevin Durant is the best player in the world. Luka Doncic is not. It is 100% ridiculous to compare them, Luka is still a kid. In 2-3 years? Yeah, let's talk. Luka will probably win a few MVPs. He's one of the most talented players I have ever seen. That has zero impact on this year's playoffs though, and Ayton is a better fit on this Suns team than Luka would be.   And it's disingenuous to act like the caliber of talent in the Nets besides Harden is the same as in Phoenix. The Nets still had KD and Harden, who are both more talented than anybody on the Suns roster, and couldn't beat Coach Bud lmfao. Also, the Harden trade had the Nets giving up LeVert as a centerpiece, which is nowhere near the same as losing Ayton would be to the Suns. It's apples and oranges."
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
"I adore how heated you are over a hypothetical situation where somebody else thinks that taking a kid who's in his second year and putting up 20/10 in the WCF might be good enough to not regret passing on Doncic.   Honestly I have no idea how anybody could watch this Suns team playing right now and especially Ayton the last several games and think this kid isn't pretty clearly a really special talent that fits absolutely perfectly into what they're doing. Replacing Ayton with Luka makes this team worse, point blank, end of story."
"How exactly. Young has scored more, better playmaker, better handler. Oh I guess since luka is 6 7 he's got rebounding! He elevates his teammates not alienates them. They are both bad defensively. People keep talking like it's impressive to lose to the Clippers. That's what it was a loss. You can celebrate losses and silver linings all day. The fact of the matter is doncic doesn't have a playoff series win. Got his coach fire. Got his gm fired him who fucking drafted him. Don't have first rounders for a while. You can whine about the west all you want but the fact is the mavs sacrificed because they thought luka was good enough to get them by and he's not and the mavs are not"
Lmao no in a million years is trading Luka Doncic. Dallas would publicly execute Mark Cuban if that happened.
"&gt; Fundamentally, this debate comes down to whether or not you'd rather have a basketball genius or a winner.  Doncic's final act before coming to the NBA was literally winning the Euroleague championship, the Euroleague MVP, and the Euroleague playoff MVP.  Now after being a .300 team for the last four years, the Hawks are the healthiest team in the injury-and-plague-ridden NBA and they are having a nice cinderella run.   You're really spinning this as Trae Young is a winner and Luka Doncic is a loser?"
"So contribute something? How much more would you want? Unless #3 is literally Luka Doncic then a package of #6, #16, an exciting young prospect in Bazley, and a future first or two is not even close to indicating “entitlement” to move up. If anything, it’s more ridiculous of fans to treat their draft picks as though they’re already 20-year-olds in the all star game."
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
"Why couldn’t they have this run without Ayton? You’re not replacing Ayton with nothing, you’re replacing him with a different player, maybe one who is less good, but they’d have the room and assets to get a fine big.   There is a real difference between Luka and Chris Paul. The former might be the best player in the league at some point going forward. To have one of these top players is a huge advantage. Ayton is a nice big man, there are other solid bigs you can afford to play when you have Luka.   As currently constructed this team partly relies on Ayton because Paul is most comfortable operating in the pick and roll. If you have Luka, but your roll man isn’t quite as good, that’s fine because Doncic can work in isolation."
Lmao Doncic over Harden is hilarious.  You can say Luka has overseas pull but then why is Kawhi in the top tier? Its cause of Kawhi's skill
"I mean he’s probably the most accomplished at his age besides Lebron, but even LBJ didnt make the playoffs until his third year if I remember correctly. His team fucking sucked though so I’ll get him that. If you think about how Doncic was the best player in the second best league in the world while he was in what would have been his freshman year of university it becomes even more impressive.  People were saying LeBron would be the next Jordan while he was in high school and tbh this isn’t much different.  Still blows my mind that he wasn’t picked first overall. I remember reading an article a year before the draft about Luka that said he could possibly be the best prospect of all time."
"I guarantee you without a doubt that the Suns would take Doncic if they had a do-over. Ayton was a great fit, but in the NBA you grab the best player period. And thats Luka."
"even with the 2016 draft class, by January they already made the ROY race Luka vs Trey and ignored TALKING about any other rookies in that class  Imagine if they had been highlighting Ayton to SOME capacity in this timeframe, he'd have real buzz behind his name right now  My theory was to use big teams to pull up less popular teams, I've watched the NHL regular season more because they shifted from Original 6 vs Original 6, Chicago, Washington, San Jose to using those big name teams in showcase games against hot streak teams(Columbus, Vegas, Nashville) or teams with stars(Colorado, Dallas, Tampa)  NBA needs to do the same, the Blazers, Suns, Nuggets, Jazz, Heat, Bucks, Pacers, Hawks need more highlighted matchups against Lebron, Kawhi, Curry, KD, Doncic, Tatum, Westbrook, Embiid"
They’ll remember that he was picked in front of Luka Doncic
&gt;CP3-Book-Ayton is better than a Luka-Book duo and whoever else they could add to that roster  Come on man. He's literally an MVP candidate who averaged 35 in the playoffs.... I'd literally swap anyone on the Wolves for Doncic.
"How does a duo of Booker+Luka scream better than CP3+Booker+Ayton? Without trading for CP3 they probably still have Rubio and Oubre which doesn't really make for a better squad AND they probably wouldn't be able to get anything closer to an Ayton level big man for that package.   Booker+Doncic is still a bad pairing, as far as superstar pairings go. Definitely not ideal for either player."
You know who every team needs? Luka Doncic
"One word, Luka Doncic"
That's what we thought about Luka Doncic but tada
"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each. One title each to pistons, Celtics, Mavericks, raptors and Cavs   LeBron has gone to 10 finals and is on pace to be the most points scored all time. The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O’Neal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De’Aaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who’s good and how the different titles were won. I love this shit so let me know if you have any questions or recommendations on where to start"
"Sports has become so advanced. Coaching, fitness, conditioning. The athletes are really pushed to what's possible with humans. It's insane to see. Watch some of lebrons highlights. Watch highlights of Derick roses MVP season. Watch Steph curry and GSW highlights. Watch Kevin Durant highlights. More recently a bunch of Europeans such as Luka doncic and giannis are coming through who are athletic freaks (watch some of giannis' dunks; he literally dunks over a 6'4 man during a match). Basketball is so exciting right now. These incredible genetics plus personalities that have been around since the NBA started, but added to incredible science makes for what can only be described as athletic anomalies."
"Doncic is 100% a generational talent. Ayton's upside is insane with like a less than 5% chance of not being perennial all NBA, but Luka IS going to be the guy over the next decade. It's Magic to Jordan to Kobe to Bron to, now, Luka."
Trae Young &amp; Luka Doncic as well
Isn't every day Luka Doncic Day?
"You Lebron stans are unreal.   Luka Doncic stats:  when not being covered by Kawhi:  80/158 (51%) from the floor and 25/57 (44%) from 3  When being covered by Kawhi: 16/38 (42%) and 6/19 (32%) from 3.    Kawhi literally made Doncic look like the worst player in the league, while putting up 32/8/5 on 72,3 ts%."
"It isn’t lool, same thing with Paul George day in OKC. I would’ve saved the Luka Doncic day for something more momentous but to each their own I guess"
"&gt; in 2019 they also had Cam Johnson, Herro, and Coby White.  I said Cam Johnson already, Herro and White didn't clear the cutoff that you made.    &gt;2018 also had Miles Bridges and Doncic wasnt a good shooter by any means but was more polished in that department than a lot of guys in this class.  I said Miles Bridges already, Luka shot 28% and 33% in the two years before he got drafted, with the 28% coming the year of the draft.  &gt;compared to classes like 2016 and 2017  2017: Fultz, Ball, Jackson(low volume), Markkanen, Smith Jr., Monk, Kennard  2016: Ingram, Dunn, Hield, Murray, Prince  Those classes still only had 5-6 proven shooters."
"Translates to ""Luka doncic is a dog poop"" for anyone too lazy to translate it"
As a Lithuanian I can say that was a mistake. We should have spent millions making another Luka Doncic.
"https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1405619826731618308  &gt; There had been simmering tension between Luka Doncic and Rick Carlisle that was a concern within the Mavs organization. The expectation was that he'd return next season, but he'd have been on the hot seat.   Luka and Carlisle disliked each other. Carlisle woulda been on the hot seat next year anyway because of it."
"Man, you're all sorts of wrong. Scola isn't 42, he's 41. I know that's not much of a difference but he was 39 when he ""carried"" Argentina to the finals. So it seems like two years is a huge difference in your mind. He also didn't carry the team. Deck, Campazzo and Vildoza are now in the NBA in part due to the amazing performances in the WC. That team was also comprised of well stablished players in Europe like Laprovittola (MVP of Liga Endesa in 2019), Brussino and Garino (all of whom had NBA experience as well). Since you claim to know European basketball so well I believe you should know this. Now, you gotta help me out with this, since I clearly don't know european basketball at all. Which 3 second rules are you talking about? The one by which you can't be in the paint for three seconds if you're the offensive player? Because that one's in the NBA, too. In fact, the NBA has the more restrictive rules, since you can't do that also if you're the defensive player. In FIBA, though? You can live in the paint if you're defending. Now, are you claiming that Giannis can't dominate because defensive players would just wait for him in the paint? It seems like you need to watch him play more, you seem to have the notion that he just jumps from the free throw line and stuffs it in the rim and that's how he got two MVPs. So, two times MVP Antetokoumpo can't carry Greece, but Luka Docic can carry a Slovenian team who has had absolutely no experience in Olympics nor WC. 39 yo Scola can and did, according to you, carry Argentina to a WC final. Finally, you say that all big teams were missing key players. Argentina knocked out Serbia in the quarter finals game. Their best player was Nikola Jokic. I know you claim you watch european basketball so you probably don't know who he is. He's the current MVP of the NBA. Other notable NBA players were Bogdan Bogdanovic (he played in the ECF with the Hawks), Bjelica and Boban Marjanovic. They also had Micic, which is the current MVP of the Euroleague. But you knew that already, you know a lot of european basketball.  In the Semi finals, Argentina beat France. Their best player was Rudy Gobert. As in, NBA's current DPOY. Also on that team: Fournier, De Colo, Ntilikina and Batum. So tell me again, who they were missing? Serbia didn't have 34 yo Teodosic which is a great player but far from the best. He got injured before the WC. So I guess that makes Argentina a non contender for these Olympics. The fact that you think an amazing yet young player like Doncic can carry an unproven and, to be honest, fairly mediocre, Slovenian team past Argentina tells me you know 0 about european (or latin american, for that matter) basketball."
luka doncic je pasji kakec
"There are plenty of teams in the olympics that can literally blow Slovenia out of the water. Lets not overeact xD  The only reason why the teams will have to be careful facing them is Luka himself. In fact, Doncic is the only reason why they have qualified...it is their first time, ever."
Build a team that fits around Luka Doncic.
"Hot take, but Doncic is already a better playmaker than LeBron.  If you need a guy to dominate an entire game I'd still take LeBron, but if you have a tie game with three minutes left, damn, I'm taking Luka right now."
"&gt; But Ben never tells his viewers that Wilt’s 1962 ranks in the TOP 4 ALL TIME in WS, OWS, and PER.  ...Who cares? These stats are trash. Mikal Bridges collected more offensive Win Shares than Luka Doncic this season"
"Oh boy, I’m already feeling for the Japanese player(s) tasked with guarding Luka Doncic."
"DSJ was put in a shitty situation tbh. yeah he's not ended up as a top 10 draft talent, but he was drafted to be the new guy for the Mavs then got replaced a year later by some goofy white dude from europe. and jj barea actually prevented the rest of the team from hazing luka like every other mavs rookie had gotten...including dsj  so yeah obviously luka is the better player but i think dsj got the short end of the stick. ive heard he's started playing defense at a decent level, and it makes me wish we could bring him back now that rick/donnie are gone so there wont be so much bad blood  having been a fan since 2006, dsj was probably the best draft pick we'd had in my fandom. so i was real excited when we drafted him. then of course doncic happened. but i'll always have a soft spot for dsj, wherever he's playing"
"""Luka Doncic is always barking about somebody and is an irritable guy"" - Brian Windhorst  He basically put out some irresponsible reporting that wasn't fair to Luka, so people are clowning him for the idea that Brian's ""teammates"" would never love him as much as Luka's clearly do here."
I’m biased but Luka Doncic is cool as fuck
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4.

"&gt;Second of all, Luka proved that calling him a ""ballhog"" is the worst hot take ever.  I think saying Luka is a ballhog is a bit much but his chemistry with Porzingis is abysmal and in many cases Porzingis has had easy opportunities for buckets and Doncic has taken the initiative onto himself to instead force bad shots."
First those 2018 Cavs or these Hawks were not beating this healthy Clippers team.  But yes the players Trae has around him is def better than what Luka has in Dallas now.   But not LeBron what had tho. Prime LeBron is still better than Doncic obviously.
"Right? But even with Luka i don't think Slovenia can win say  a Gold medal with just Luka ball (as amazing as he is) if you face a team with 2 or 3 top creators their offense is just going to out score you 9 out of 10 times.   Obviously, when we are talking about talents like Doncic he can always win you that 1 out of 10"

Luka  Doncic
"Slovenia is in no way better on paper. Lithuania is filled with Euroleague players, while Slovenia without Luka would have only a couple elite players. So the only special thing for Slovenia on paper is Luka Doncic."
"This is such a dumb logic. You don’t automatically get to discount free throws just because it says something you don’t like lmao. Imagine we did that with every player. “Yeah if you take away Rudy Gobert’s rim protection he’s a pretty average defender”. Imagine we did this with Doncic. “Yeah if you take away Luka’s 3 point advantage then Trae is clearly better”. See how dumb that logic is?  The reality is free throws are part of the game and have to be accounted for. Like we’re literally talking about taking away **30%** of both players points just for the sake of it lmao.   Luka is the better shooter, Trae is the better FT shooter, but he’s *close enough* at scoring from the field that his FT advantage means their production is similar overall.  Again, you’re welcome to favour Luka but to say the words *it isn’t even close* is 100% false in every way. Which team do you cheer for? I’m guessing you’re a salty Philly fan?"
"Alas, what shall we do about the underperforming Luka Doncic? Guess we’ll just have to be stuck with him."

This is exactly why assholes like Pat Beverly and Markus Morris are allowed to try and hurt the Luka Doncic and Devin Bookers of the world……..there is simply no real consequences…..so break a nose or stomp an injured ankle…..Duh!
"At the time, it was Trae Young + a No. 1 pick for Luka Doncic. Depending on where the balls fell, that could have been Rui Hachimura or Darius Garland. The Mavs pick really dropped during the lottery, so all things considered, the Hawks did well, but not nearly as well as they could have got for that haul."
"""And the Los Angeles Lakers win their 12th consecutive ring against the Miami Heat. The Lakers are headlined by Zion Williamson, Luka Doncic, and Cade Cunningham!"""

2022: Luka Doncic   Jalen Harris is then reinstated to the league   2023 - 2030: Jalen Harris
Winning an Olympic Gold is a bigger accomplishment than winning an NBA Title for Luka Doncic.   Like if and when he wins an NBA Title he'll be surrounded by superstars of the leagues   If he ever wins an Olympic gold he'll be surrounded by guys who'd average 5-10 minutes in the NBA as a bench warmer   So Olympic Gold with Slovenia is by far a greater accomplishment than an NBA Title cause the US starting line up is just a pick and choose from the All-Star team  This is partly why I think Simmons should get selfish and play with Team Australia if they have a legit shot.

"""I think I deserve a promotion for getting Luka Doncic to play for the national team."""
You should players minds change all the time. Unfortunately for you you’re trying to say it’s more likely that Jokic passes up a supermax to leave a place he already says he loves and who’s personality he frankly matches than it is for Doncic to leave a place he’s already had problems with teammates and front office members at. Frankly it’s not likely either player leaves but far more likely that luka leaves over jokic.   Also Dak is not wavy. He’s not Lamar Jackson. The most wavy thing about his is that he’s a Qb for the cowboys. He’s about as cool as Von. I’d way rather have one of the greatest QBs ever and a super bowl MVP than a overpaid quarterback coming off a serious injury but hey that’s just me. Not like It had any relevance and wasn’t a dumb idea anyway.
If luka becomes a FA him and Doncic will not be in DEN or DAL.

"“Like playing against bunch of pat beverley..”-Luka Doncic, probably"
"No, I'm not trying to say KAT and Porzingis are comparable players.  Yes, I know Porzingis plays with Doncic while KAT is functionally the lone star on his team.   I just thought it was funny to look at the stats both put up this year given that KAT is viewed as a top center and the centerpiece that the Wolves should build around, while Porzingis is seen as an albatross and somebody that the Mavs need to offload ASAP to have a chance at building a successful team around Luka."
"The first thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Luka Doncic.  The second thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Trae Young.  The third thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Shay Gilgeous-Alexander.  I could continue with Michal Bridges, Michael Porter Jr., Colin Sexton but you get the picture.   He turned out (largely but perhaps not only) because of injuries to be a lesser player than some of his 2018-Draft contemporaries."
Anthony Bennett was drafted before Luka Doncic
"Incoming: the same Hawks fans who were spamming that Doncic is considered better than Trae only because the Mavericks are better as a team, which is because of the help he's got, now use Hawks' conference finals run to throw shade at Luka."
More like Luka Doncic took us to 7 games with 35ppg on 49% from the field and 40% from 3
"See: Jason Kidd, Rajon Rondo, Luka Doncic, Nerlens Noel, Chandler Parsons, Samuel Dalembert, Jae Crowder (not sure if they actively clashed, but Carlisle horribly underutilized him), Deshawn Stevenson, etc."
"Yeah his weaknesses amplify each other. Like if you are going to spend tons of time in the mid range game to really maximize it as a strength you have to be a good playmaker. Utilize that area of the court as real estate to set up guys. When you enter mid range your first thought should be, ""Can I from this part of the court set someone up for a layup or wide open 3"" and if thats not there then you can think about taking a pull up. It's how someone like Chris Paul operates. CJ though that's not his game so it makes him less threatening and makes the mid range less valuable. Like Luka Doncic when he enters the 5-10 ft floater range is thinking ""Let me see if I can throw a lob first"" and plan B is to take the floater if it's not there. CJ is too limited in that regard.   Bottom line is you need to be doing something from that area of the court to be stressing defenses. Even if you arent amazing playmaker, if you are a good mid range shooter and good finisher at the rim who can get by his guy fast that works also you are bending/affecting the defense in a certain way that opens things up for others. CJ you just dont get any of that."
Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic
Luka Doncic
"Kira Lewis Jr. earned minutes as the season progressed. Used his speed solidly throughout the season and I thought he played his best next to Nickeil, Zion (duh), and Jax. He almost looks like a vet out there with the composure he showed. I’d like to see improvement shooting the ball and using his speed to turn the corner more on defenders and be more aggressive when attacking the basket.  Naji Marshall is probably the reason Josh Hart won’t be returning to the Pels. This guy literally “just plays hard as fuck.” He’s the best on ball defender on our team and makes winning plays.   Lastly, Didi came over late from the NBL, but he showed signs of being a pesky defender. One of his first assignments was Luka Doncic, and he frustrated Luka a bit. Offense is a work in progress."
"This is a lazy explanation for Luka that I keep seeing. Slovenia has a population of just over 2 million. There are more people in cities like Houston or States like New Mexico. You don’t really see other European players getting a disproportionate number of all star votes, unless they’re literally MVPs like Giannis or Jokic.  Luka just has A LOT of fans. There are tons of people out there who think he’s the baby goat, or the next LeBron, but white and slower. [The baby name “Luka” has even skyrocketed in the US since 2018.](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2021/05/13/oh-baby-a-record-number-of-kids-being-named-after-luka-doncic-are-now-toddling-from-dallas-to-panama/)  People want to crown the next guy up. Same thing happened to Grant Hill, Vince Carter, and Kobe."
"""The Milwaukee Bucks have reportedly offered their entire roster for Luka Doncic."""
"Well, he’s obviously not Luka Doncic. The thing about Euroleague is that young guys do not often get playing time. It’s not a feeder for the NBA: These teams have plenty of grown ass men, former NBA players, etc who will get playing time over promising young players.  There was a very in-depth analysis on him here:  https://www.canishoopus.com/2021/6/24/22530528/what-could-leandro-bolmaro-be-timberwolves-2021-nba-draft   He’s a good and extremely aggressive defender. Good size and general athleticism. He’s got promise as a Jack of all trades forward who can shoot, playmake and defend at a quality NBA level."
"Luka.  &gt;..I ask Doncic whether he plans on adopting a nickname like Porzingis' Three Six Latvia, and he smiles mischievously. ""Swaggy L,"" he says.   &gt;   &gt;Both Julio and Alyson groan.   &gt;   &gt;""Swaggy ... LD,"" he suggests."

"There was a guy he played with once. 6'5"". Beard. Better than Luka Doncic. Do you recall?"
"Wish I had this in mind when this thread was first made, but: James Harden is better than Luka Doncic."
"Without knowing anything about who this is, I’m just going to imagine it’s Luka Doncic with a mustache as a disguise"
"You are technically correct that he shoots better at every part from the floor but his overall efficiency is not better. Luka Doncic for 2020-2021 nba season shot .479% while Booker shot .484 from the floor. Luka is 9.8/20.5 FG while Booker is 9.3/19.2, .479 vs .484.  Also, Kawhi absolutely stopped Luka while George struggled. I would say Booker and Luka are both equally as bad on defense than either are good or better than either. It would be redundant to argue Giannis is a better free throw shooter than Shaq when both are/were simply bad."
do u mean Luka and Doncic?
My favorite young duo rn is Luka Doncic and his fellow Dallas Maverick Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic is way better and easily the best under-25 player. It’s not even close.

I honestly don’t think it is. The gap offensively is very large imo. Giannis’ passing game compared to Jokic is like Dennis Schröder to Luka Doncic. Then you have to consider Jokic’s scoring efficiency has translated much better to the postseason compared to Giannis. If my goal was to build a championship roster I’d probably choose current Jokic over any version of Giannis.
"physical limitations? He was 6'10 and went toe to toe against physical specimens like Dominique wilkins.  He could still move at his size.  Luka Doncic appears slower than bird and he's doing just fine.  I mean look at Jokic who is exponentially slower than either, yet he just won MVP."
Apparently everyone who list Luka Doncic
1. Cade Cunningham is not the next Luka Doncic. 2. Alperen Sengun is not the next Nikola Jokic. 3. The clippers will be a lottery team next season.
"&gt; I also statistically don’t see an argument for lebron over luka at this point  The advanced impact metrics (EPM, LEBRON, RAPTOR) all had LeBron ahead of Doncic on a per-possession basis last year.  Luka's scoring efficiency is just a step below the tier 1 guys."
Kidd will likely bring the best out in Doncic. Luka is going to respect him greatly in a way he wouldn’t Carlisle or other coaches just because Kidd was every bit of the player he is.  Giannis gives Kidd major credit to this day for how he pushed him. Redditors are upset about a lot of non basketball stuff when it comes to Kidd.
"You're ignoring some context regarding a few of these series but I'm not going to waste time in hashing out ever single detail about that. But my original point of:   &gt;while I’ll admit to giving the edge to Luka, it’s not enough for me to say he’s definitely better than him, let alone a whole tier ahead.  still stands. I can easily just use this excerpt from the article:  &gt;Over Doncic’s career, Dallas is 10 games under .500 (55-65) in “clutch” games, where the score has been within five in the last five minutes. In all other games, the Mavs are 63-46. Doncic’s tendency to wear down late in games where he has been asked to carry a Herculean load from start to finish very likely has something to do with that underperformance.  &gt;So the question becomes three-pronged: Do the Mavericks need to surround Doncic with a better mix of talent? Does he need to be a more willing off-ball player? Or is it a situation where if he were in peak, marathon-runner condition, he could finish games out better?  &gt;Probably a combination of all three, but the first is both the easiest fix and likely to have the biggest impact, as Doncic will be more amenable to off-ball play when there is someone else who can create shots on the floor. Further, while he could perhaps be somewhat better-conditioned, there is a fine line to tread here, as Doncic’s size and physicality is a big part, no pun intended, of why he is so effective.  To make the case that Lillard is actually BETTER than Doncic, but that'd be nonsensical. Neither one is better than the other by a significant degree to warrant being placed amongst the KD/LeBron tier."
Dame averages 1 more point and yes he is a much better shooter than Luka but Luka trumps him in bascially everything else so because of that Im going with Doncic
"I'm sorry, luka doncic is NOT tier 2. He's tier 1 for sure"
"Cuban already said he would dump his wife for Luka. He is adamant about keeping KP because he thinks KP is Luka's Nash (for some reason). He travelled to Slovenia just to sign his new contract.  If Kidd ruffles Luka in any way that he doesn't like, well, that's why Kokosov is in the staff. Insurance policy. We are the Doncic Mavericks until Luka decides it is time for him to make the obligatory pilgrim route to Miami."
"as a frequent luka (doncic) enjoyer, it's pretty hard to impress me nowadays. but this... this pass blew my mind as soon as i saw it"

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
Luka doncic too. He is not as bad as his first 2 years.
"I just told you I’d take 1-12 over the Mavs, I’m not going into a detailed explanation of why. I don’t care enough. What I will say is this, in 2008 the 8th seed Hawks took the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics to 7 games in the first round, they were barely a top 15 team. I cannot emphasize enough how much I don’t care about what you almost did. Every team I’m taking over them has proven more.  What it takes to almost win a playoff series and what it takes to win a playoff series are two completely different things and Dallas hasn’t shown the can do the latter. You’re right Luka Doncic is a very good basketball boy. It’s not enough. That team has got to do something more to get this kind of respect."
"&gt; ""foreign proven talents""  &gt; darko milicic  Darko's pick was more like prospect than a proven player.  Check EuroLeague, EuroCup and domestic leagues stats of Pau Gasol, Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis, Danilo Gallinari, Andrea Bargnani, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender and Alperen Sengun in their season before they were drafted. You should see that Luka and Pau were players that proven their worth in Europe and Bargnani, Bender and Darko were more like hopes as their stats weren't great enough yet."
Cade is not 6'8.   Hes definitely not LUKA DONCIC.   I bet he does not have 7'1 wingspan.   He is not NO 1 pick
Did the OP call him a bust? Literally go an read it. He said Cade has stuff to work on. You guys are just sad that Cade isn't Luka freaking Doncic.
He’ll go from the next Luka Doncic to the next Mugsy Bogues
"""I prefer not to speak. if I speak I'm in big trouble. in big trouble and I don't want to be in big trouble.""  \-Luka Doncic"
"&gt;I still don't understand how you don't pick Luka right there. I'll never understand it  It happens when you're trying to be way too clever, and end up outsmarting yourself. Remember that thing from a few years ago when Vivek thought it would be super clever to play 4-on-5 on defense, or something stupid like that?  It's all well and good to be someone who zigs when others are zagging, after an intelligent analysis has suggested it might be the right thing to do. The Kings are a franchise that zigs *because* others are zagging, which is stupid.  ""Oh, everyone thinks Luka Doncic is the best player in the draft? Well, then, we should select someone else, because everyone can't be right... Right?"""
"The super league would’ve in fact killed smaller teams. It contradicts the decades-old footballing culture of promotion/ relegation, fighting for 4th place, etc.  The issue with the super league is, it presets what teams are allowed to play in the competition, and it would’ve been the largest revenue generating competition if the top teams were included.  So, imagine if the lakers, heat, warriors, nets, and knicks created a “playoffs 2”, that only they could play in, regardless of ranking in the regular season. And, the most money would be made by playing in such tournaments. So, what happens is, the teams included would hold a monopoly on money making, and with that money would sign the best talent. This would leave other teams behind, and reduce the significance of the champions league and league placement.   I personally am not a fan of the pay-to-win system in soccer… no team should be allowed to have the equivalent of Michael Jordan, kyrie, and Luka doncic, in the form of Messi, Neymar, and mbappe.  If nba teams want to have a super team, they have to manage cap space perfectly, and eventually pay a large tax bill. Football teams can splash cash without regard for parity."

"It's still a big issue, here's a direct quote: &gt; Doncic will soon sign a $200 million contract with Dallas, which means that the insurance for his future arrival in a Slovenian jersey will be several times higher than its current value. This is already a huge sum for the Federation, and additional funds will have to be found to pay for a multiple of this value. Milić assures that they will do everything they can to succeed: ""On the one hand, it is fortunate that when there is euphoria, when a story like this is being written, it is easier to find the money for such things. We know that it will be harder and harder. Luka is about to sign one of the biggest contracts in sport. It will be a bit more difficult for us, but it is true that we are not only looking at the Slovenian market. We are grateful to the sponsors we have. I cannot burden them with our problems any more if they are already giving as much as they can. There are too few companies in Slovenia anyway and, after all, all sports rely on the same ones. If they can give more, so much the better, but we will also try to find the means elsewhere with our federations and imagination so that every action, when healthy, can come. After the Games we have important things to do, like the European Championships and the qualifiers for the Worlds. The tide is turning and we want to hold back the tide. We don't want finances to be an obstacle to playing for the national team for this group of guys who are playing for free for the country and sacrificing their holidays. We will do our best. We will have to roll up our sleeves. We will do everything we can to make sure that he continues to play and enjoy on the court with his friends.""  https://www.rtvslo.si/sport/oi-2020/sporti/kosarka/naredili-bomo-vse-da-bo-doncic-se-naprej-s-prijatelji-kartal-in-uzival-na-igriscu/590047"
"Harden is better in 3s. Granted he can have off nights, but Doncic is more inconsistent. Not sure about midrange for Harden, I'll give that to Doncic if you'll separate layup from midrange. If it's just 2pts, then Harden is still better. Freethrow...nuff said.  &gt; far better defender? not really  Yah, no. Harden is laughable earlier on Rockets. When they committed on small no one could deny him the fact that he stepped up big time in defensive end. And he factually did a great job. Doncic on the other hand lingers around the elbow pointing, looking, shouting, and waiting for a miss for a rebound. And yes, that's how he get those rebounds. AKA the Westbrook rebound. Which arguably is a good play since he can push the ball right after a rebound. Again, Doncic may be a good defender, he just doesn't show it yet. And maybe, because of his conditioning. He has a habit of fading in the final quarter. Again, he could be a good defender if he actually try like Harden did, he just hasn't shown it yet. So, I'll give that to Harden, and I'll repeat, a far better defender.  &gt; harden didn’t push anything vs that warriors team, he had a mediocre series in 2018 to be kind  Thank you for a kind assessment. And again, I'll take what Harden gave against *that* Warriors. If mediocre means scoring 41, 27, 20, 30, 19, 32, 32 in a 7 game series while LeBron got swept, I'll take mediocre over Doncic next season as OP asked.  &gt; great series still but not better than luka vs clippers, he did the great scoring plus had like 75 assists vs the clippers  And yes, that was a masterpiece by Doncic. If only it resulted in a W."

You’re right. I should just panic constantly about my favorite NBA team that I watch to relax and enjoy myself. Lol I’m happy we have Luka Doncic and we just signed him to a max 5 year deal and took a top team to 7 games last year. Sorry I’m not worried enough for you lol

"I mean him being 2 inches shorter than he says certainly changes his role. I get that you’re a Pistons fan but it’s delusional to think that his height being 2 inches shorter than it really is doesn’t matter in any way.   To me his comp goes from Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic to Zach Lavine and Jaylen Brown.   That’s not a bad thing, those two players are amazing, they just aren’t as amazing as the freaks of nature that are Jayson and Luka."
"You're looking at it from the wrong perspective. You see this as just signing a piece of paper, but Mark &amp; the Mavs see this as resigning Luka Doncic.  It could possibly be Luka wants them to do the signing in Slovenia, or it could be a nice gesture from Mark and the Mavs as others have said.  Either way, when you have a generational talent like this you want to keep them as happy as possible.  It's Luka Doncic, when a player of this talent is on your team you don't ask questions about these kinds of things."
"He actually has similar numbers to Kukoc. Kukoc was not that great on the NBA , a great role player (much like Fournier when he is incentivized to play). Granted Kukoc played on a higher level (the Bulls were contenders), but he was not *that* great of an NBA player. Kinda proves my point, an NBA role player was thought a legend back in Europe.  Today's Euro legends are dominating the NBA as well (Gianni's/Luka/Jokic, Gobert even). Never happened before, today's Euros would beat yesteryear's legends Stoopid. IMO only young Sabonis was on their level and Petrovic could stand as a starter level player (but still no match to Doncic or Gianni's, possibly no match to Jokic as well)."
See: Luka Doncic
"After hearing all the Luka Doncic comps being pushed, it definitely looks like Cade is both smaller than Luka AND not as quick (handle isn't remotely comparable yet either). So I dont see that one at all.  But yeah SL stats doesnt mean anything , Cunningham is a pretty sure bet to be a good NBA player."

Luka doncic. That is all
Yeah cause Luka Doncic has been so successful in the playoffs
"I think Dallas is a great city tbh. At least better than OKC, where Paul George gave up going to lakers to play with westbrook. Same with KG and Ray Allen teaming up with Paul Pierce in Boston. I guess we will see if my theory is correct with Luka Doncic, if any superstars would ever want to team up with him"
"If FIBA follows the NBA tradition of MVP having to be from the championship team, Durant is a no brainer. On a team consisting of some of the best NBA players in the world, dude was still a level above everyone else.  But if this can be awarded to the best player of the tournament, period... then it should without a doubt be Patty Mills (27/7/5) or Luka Doncic (23/10/10). Both were clearly more valuable to Australia/Slovenia than KD was to USA."
"imo he should have been on an Olympic ""all-star"" team before doncic and rubio, but I don't really know the criteria here.  Luka was by far the best player for Slovenia so maybe that's makes him more qualified -- same for Rubio."
The two most unstoppable offensive players with the DPOY. Would be fucking insane.   I would actually think that Durant and Doncic would be good together as well to as Luka could be the creator and Durant only having to focus on scoring
"1) Anthony Bennett- Other busts are not 1st overall material. He simply wasn’t an NBA level player.   2) Sam Bowie- Not as terrible but picked over Jordan, Barkley, Stockton, etc   3) LaRue Martin- Picked ahead of Bob Macadoo and Julius Erving with the 1st overall pick. Scored a 1,430 points before washing out of the league in 4 years   4) Darko Milicic- Detroit was insanely lucky that they had a top pick in a stacked draft while already having a great squad. They could have had a dynasty picking nearly anyone else.   5) Marvin Bagley III- It’s early to put him on this list. The 2018 draft was amazing and he was picked over Luka Doncic, Trae Young, MPJ, and a lot of other nice players"

"I mean Doncic has only been better for about a year so yeah? What am I supposed to do, go 'ok yeah Harden 5 years ago was better than a HS kid? Yeah of course he was!'  I'll clarify (and I'm partly trolling because I hate Harden, full bias disclosure). As of right now Luka is a more skilled versatile winning basketballer I would prefer to Harden if they were the 2 best available left as of my first pick in a fantasy draft. It's close but he's closer to prime now, a tiny bit better for me rn, and because any such draft/signing would be cute the coming year and beyond, I know where the upside is. As of today Harden has obviously had the incomparably better career because they're a different generation, but their graph trajectories are heading in opposite directions and I think as of the last year or so, if not very shortly, have overlapped."
"I would say Kyle Lowry, Jokic or Luka Doncic even if he's young this kid is a genius. They all have an insane basketball IQ."

"Unfortunately they lost to the 82-0 Blazers in the finals 10 times in an row, Damian Lillard is 45 and has just won his 6 straight mvp alongside Bron Jr, Nassir, Anfernee Simons and Luka Doncic, etc. Simons is best 3pt shooter ever, Luka is still great even though he is very old. Blazers Are coached by Brandon Roy and Aldridge, Cj McCollum is the owner of the blazer after retiring in 2029."
"Sure, whatever bud.  Luka Doncic is less injury prone than James Harden.  Just like Chris Paul is less injury prone than LeBron James."
Incorrect. That’s not a strawman. It’s exactly the same argument you’re using.  Luka Doncic is objectively more injury prone than James Harden. How is this even an argument lmfao.  Put your money where you mouth is. Bet that Luka will play more games than Harden next season…
We’re talking about Luka Doncic here lol not some scrub that’s not in the same tier as Harden. They’re arguably the 6th and 7th best players in the world.
U only need to know luka doncic is the best player along with kd
I mean fine it’s your opinion but I’m just saying whilst Doncic is a way better playmaker he is terrible at defence and Tatum is a waayy better defender. And looking at the stats Tatum also has a better 3pt% and is generally the better 3pt shooter the way he’s been improving I feel that his fg% and rebounding (it’s literally a 0.4 difference when it comes to rebounding numbers) will become equal or even slightly better than Luka
"Bro 4th place from a team that shouldn't have even been there.  Luka carried them so far, Dragic, as well.  I know it is a medal position but holy shit were these guys incredible.  I imagine they'll develop some more talent for 2024 and I wouldn't be surprised if they medal while Doncic is playing."

"No, I mean he allowed one leakout in transition today and one technical due to arguing - that's 3 points. His teammates were flopping, causing flagrants, allowing multiple leakouts in transition, and missing rotations because they were doing what you say Luka does. It's not as much of a problem as you may think it is for Doncic."

"I'm sad for Luka Doncic but he's still young and has a couple more tries to medal in the Olympics, super happy Patty got his though!"
Finishing one win away from a medal in the country's first Olympic appearance is remarkable. Luka Doncic really took a country the size of New Mexico to the bronze medal game.
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Luka Doncic type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing was Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."

I wonder if Luka Doncic goes to sleep dreaming of being Patty Mills.
Luka 'its everyone elses fault but mine' Doncic
"need to keep abusing doncic, our first 4 baskets all came on bad luka defence"
Luka Doncic…. More like LUKA DONKEY!!!
"[ESPN] Luka Doncic is traded to Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Mitch Marner, William Nylander, and 2022 FRP"
MVP Luka doncic
lol dame has done that same type of carrying as those other guys lmao.    also postseason sucess Lillard &gt; doncic   so by ur logic lillard is a superstar and luka isnt
"Stock Up:  1.) Holiday: Dude provided the US with lockdown defense, playmaking ability and some clutch scoring.  2.) Tatum: Looks like he will take over as the best pure scorer in the league next year.  3.) Luka Doncic: 48 point bomb and didn't play the full game and 1 REB away from a triple double in another game.     Stock Down:   1.) Bradley: Dude was so bad he was kicked off the team  2.) Dame: Dude was just as bad and should've been cut from the team as well.  3.) Devin Booker: 0/4 FG in the final game for gold. Dude sucks in the biggest moments."
This game was great and all (not rlly) but I’m mainly looking forward to see Olympic Patty Mills versus Luka Doncic. That’s a matchup of two titans right there
"At the end of his career, Luka Doncic will not be considered a top 20 player in NBA history."
"Dude, Toronto has one of the most highly regarded FOs in the league. They have trouble attracting FAs due to being international, but they have almost always drafted well, especially lately. They have made good moves with trades for the most part. The Mavericks haven’t been able to win with prime Dirk, and are continuing to underperform with Luka Doncic. Don’t act like your franchise is better when it has been clearly outperformed by a younger franchise with more challenges than most teams."

Vlade Divac and Luka Doncic
"Luka the best passer in the league? He’s not even top 3 lmfao, laughable statement. Luka has only played two playoff series, Dame has played what, like 12? Lot bigger sample size there.   Luka was not getting buckets on Kawhi like that, he was getting buckets on switches against Pat Bev and Jackson, so the going against two elite wing defender point is moot because his matchup stats against Kawhi are terrible, he clamped him whenever he fought through the screen and got the 1on1, especially in the clutch.   As for defense, Luka got absolutely cooked on defense as well as Dame, Kawhi literally went out of his way to get that matchup and cooked him Game 6.   Dame is an underrated passer, he has garbage teammates and averaged the same amount of assists as Luka so I don’t know what your point is about Luka being such a better passer.   CJ has outperformed Dame two years ago, yes but the last two years he’s been abysmal in the playoffs. That’s like saying Luka has All-Star help with KP lol, not sure why you keep on bringing up CJ considering how abysmal he was.    When it comes down to it, Dame is a far better shooter than Luka, and a more efficient scorer. I think Luka is a better playmaker, but it’s closer than you think. Dame’s teammates also miss wide open looks like Luka’s.   Luka handles the trap better than Dame I agree, but unlike Luka Dame looks to set up his teammates before himself in the beginning of games to pace himself which Doncic needs to do, considering how gassed he gets in the fourth.   Another point, Luka is significantly worse in the clutch than Dame which is why I put Dame higher. Luka’s fourth quarter stats were really bad against the clips, he averaged like 4 points on 25% shooting with 1 assists and 1 TO in Q4. Dame… well you know how Dame is in the clutch."

"Whenever you want you can see the replay here https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oyrp5m/olympic_games_the_no_goaltending_from_france/  Of course it was a crazy and intense game, and it happen thank to your incredible team and a really talented Luka Doncic. Nobody should be ashamed of this game, your team can be really proud of what they have done until now and I really wish you to have the third place.  I'm just sad to see most of sloven are bad losers and think they lost only because of referee (22 foul whistled against france, 17 against slovenia ...) but not because of the crazy defense of france:  28% of FP for Doncic and 8 blocks from french players."
I’d recommend finding a player you like to watch and cheering for them. Teams change constantly and if you’re not actually from a city that has a team there’s not much of a reason to tie yourself to one.  If you’re European you might want to checkout some Euro stars like Luka Doncic and Giannis.
Can we get another one of that Luka Doncic guy?
"Trae is my second favorite player, but that doesn’t mean he’s better than Luka. Doncic was significantly better from a statistical standpoint in the post season. Trae didn’t have to play the Clippers in the first round, so that’s why he advanced and the Mavs didn’t."
"&gt; it has been two years  Whether you and I like it or not, this debate will continue as long as Trae Young and Luka Doncic are relavant"
Luka Doncic plays for a different NBA team than the Mavs ?
"Luka is the epitome of position less basketball man just because he is a guard doesn’t mean pat is supposed to be well equipped to guard him he is several inches taller and just straight up bigger than him  Pat can’t guard him he doesn’t have to the attributes to and thats fine you make adjustments for that. That doesn’t mean pat is a bad defender because luka doncic is a matchup nightmare for him he is still good at what he does we saw that in the suns series.  Idk why i even respond to you, you just dont like pat and you use that to shit on his game and call him useless when anyone who actually watches basketball wouldn’t say some dumb shit like that"
"&gt;And honestly, I'd say you're out of your mind if you really think that Luka would rather win a gold medal than an NBA final.  [Not according to Luka.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10007006-luka-doncic-winning-gold-medal-with-slovenia-would-mean-more-than-nba-championship)"
Bogut must never have heard of Luka Doncic.
"Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, and Harden/Kyrie aren't in the league?"
I understand where you’re coming from but you gotta understand its not one just 1 guy who is famous its a couple of guys so it would be weird if Phelps gets special treament /Luka Doncic does and their teammates dont
"That’s odd to me - given that there are bigger non-US celebrities like Naomi Osaka, Luka Doncic or Usain Bolt that the general public would recognize over a Jrue Holiday.  Or non-basketball celebrities from the US like Simone Biles or Michael Phelps."
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Luka Doncic type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
Oh remember Hornets legend Kobe Bryant or Atlanta Hawks legend Luka Doncic? It's called a trade look it up.
"Dragic deserves the minimum with the Mavericks. He’s made his money, he should take a pay cut to play with Luka Doncic"
Tell that to the franchise that choose Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic. Or literally countless other examples.
"You mean Real Madrid and barca? Ignite would beat em both, and the rest of the league is primarily players with the ability to make the NBA. This is like the “would X university beat X professional team?” arguments. Real Madrid mught bring through a player like Luka Doncic but their bench would be absolutely overrun by the worst G League teams"
To think Vlade drafted this bum because he said he wanted to be here. Bumley and budget Lavar Dadley when we could have had Luka and Mama Doncic in town
"Bro, in a Draft with DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young and Luka motherfucking Doncic, they took Marvin Bagley with the 2nd pick.   And there's a possibility they give us Buddy Hield for scraps, who statistically, is the 3rd best shooter in the league the last 3 years.  Get outta here with the fucking Kings."
"I mean nobody talks about Steph as a ball hog. Or Embiid. Someone like Doncic gets it excused as he’s doing it because of the circumstances he’s in while Westbrook for some reason doesn’t even though he’s played many more years in the league than Luka and all but two of them were lower usage than Luka’s non-rookie seasons.  Of those who played enough to qualify, Russ had the 15th highest usage % this past season.  Ahead of him were (in this order) Doncic, Embiid, Steph, Beal, Mitchell, Trae, Booker, Giannis, Lebron, Dame, Fox, Lavine, Tatum, Kyrie."
Would james harden and Luka doncic also not translate well to the Olympic game? Lmao
Luka Doncic
"So when Luka f’ing Doncic is available they *don’t* draft him because Fox is already the point guard (Vlade was GM then, but still).  Then they proceed to draft point guards two years in a row and forget fit completely, especially this year when there were arguably better picks on the board and fit is a bigger consideration.  What a mess lol"

He can't play 82 games full strengh, guns blazing like doncic and KD  In the last regular season he was fully healthy, at the age of 36, he played more games AND averaged more minutes played than Luka and KD have last season or this season so that's wrong  \&gt;Bron was MVP candidate becouse he was on an isane team  And yet the second he went down they turned to shit and had a 44% win percentage without him...sure that's insane lol  \&gt; That duo was insane 2 years ago, but bron can't play the minutes he used to  Not a single piece of statistics that show that  And then back to the hypotheticals. ""Bron won't be able to this, born won't be able to do that"" When has he not done it??? Never. Every. Single. Time he's been healthy he's at least been a top 3 player in the league. Same goes for AD (Maybe not top 3 but top 10)  \&gt;How the fuck is it nonsensicat, that next year luka will be better than lebron  Because there is not a single piece of evidence that has shown than Luka is a better player than Lebron when healthy"
"Bro bron is old. He can't play 82 games full strengh, guns blazing like doncic and KD. They are better and defense, but luka+ KD would be one of thd top offenses ever. Last season, lukas mavs had the best offense ever, now imagine dwitching for example pingus with KD.  Bron was MVP candidate becouse he was on an isane team.  Doncic on a good team is top 5, if he again steps up his game( like he did every year for the last 5), he is absolutely top 5, maybe top 3 (better conditiong, better free throws). KD is top 3 or at least top 5.  That duo was insane 2 years ago, but bron can't play the minutes he used to. How the fuck is it nonsensicat, that next year luka will be better than lebron? I am willing to bet a LOT of money that this will be true. Luka came in this season fat and uncondisioned, becouse he tought where will be one more month of offseason. But after he got back, and after the allstar game, he was back to old luka from his second season, even better then he was his second season. You think that a primer approaching dončić next season will.be worse than a 37 year lebron? What the hell. And even if he won't, KD will be for sure better than kebron next year, and luka is better than AD (offensivly, AD defense in elite). So yeah, next season and further years KD&gt; lebron and luka&gt;AD"

Nice to see one of these young boys acknowledging LeBron’s influence on their games. LeBron haters love to pretend like nobody idolizes LeBron (see Luka Doncic) or would copy his game

Japanese Luka Doncic vs Slovenian Luka Doncic
"He has been doing this for years. He's skirting around the rules ESPN imposed on him by writing tweets in that specific way. From an article a few years back:  'For the NBA Draft, ESPN insider Adrian Wojnarowski will be “lasered” in on tipping the draft choices on Twitter before they are on TV.  In other words, Wojnarowski, with a wink, will attempt to put out the picks before NBA commissioner Adam Silver announces them. This plan is a change from what ESPN and NBA executives agreed to for last year’s draft.  Prior to the 2018 selection show, the NBA and its league partners, including ESPN, said publicly that its reporters would not foretell the choices before they were on TV.  While Wojnarowski and fellow insider Shams Charania, then of NBA partner Yahoo, sat out to start the draft, Marc Stein, formerly of ESPN and now of the New York Times, swooped in and forecasted the first three picks while also breaking the Luka Doncic deal.  Though it was unclear if this was his plan all along, Wojnarowski jumped in with both feet. His creative choice of words — Boston is “tantalized” by Robert Williams at No. 27 — to indicate the picks became a social media sensation.'"
"Kawhi literally just outplayed Luka in a playoff series. Kd, Giannis, Steph, LeBron, Jokic, Kawhi, Harden are all clearly better than Luka Doncic please"

"Sorry for my lack of knowledge but in what NBA team, Luka Doncic plays???"
We really are a spoiled fanbase to go from Bucks' legend Dirk Nowitzki to Hawks' legend Luka Doncic
I see no flaws in this logic. My guess is Tristan Thompson and our second this year for Luka Doncic and this years and next years first from the Mavericks.    Who says no?

1) Kevin Durant 2) Giannis 3) Lebron James 4) Steph Curry 5) James Harden 6) Luka Doncic 7) Nikola Jokic 8) Damian Lillard 9) Anthony Davis 10) Joel Embiid
but unless cade is a nearly instant superstar like doncic you would just be resetting the rebuild to step 0   no guarantee cade can react luka or even young level by year 3

That's why Luka Doncic saying that winning the gold medal with Slovenia in the Olympics would mean more than an NBA title shouldn't be that controversial
"Josh Richardson is the fool's gold, he already fooled the 76ers and Mavs  THJ has his faults but he was one of the few guys on the Mavs not named Luka Doncic who can say they showed up somewhat in the playoffs"
"Yall over thinking this. Last year Dorian and Hardaway were starting alongside Doncic. Those 2 usually got the tougher assignments on defense whether it was a guard or wing. The pg is basically hte main ball handler. '16 Lebron was the pg, because Kyrie had more of a scoring iso role. Nets had Harden as a main handlers when healthy, but in the playoffs KD was the only option. Giannis is usually posting up or secondary playmaker. Khris and Jrue usually setup offense.  Luka is going to be the main ball handler on offense and Lowry the second."
He said he didnt know much about luka and was wary of foreign players and listed bagley as one of the players he likes in the draft  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPZVZN-D5RE&amp;t=361s  As for as i know this is the only evidence of any kings player suggesting that they would be unhappy with doncic
"Revisionist history. It was not a toss up among the fan base. Aside from the apologists, look at the [reaction on the Bagley draft thread calling it an awful pick.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8swpmi/2018_draft_2_pick_marvin_bagley_iii_duke/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf].

"Luka Doncic be like ""Who's in charge? You or Mike?"""
Lebron didn't even compete in the olympics despite being the best american player in the world why aren't you criticizing him.  Also the only person I simp for is luka doncic
I get erections when I see Luka Doncic drop 48 in FIBA sanctioned games. What should I do about that ?
"dante exum is 6'6, the hype coming in to the draft was luka doncic esque. although hampered by injuries"
"Not arguing about doncic being more famous, just stating that Dame isnt a global household name superstar outside the US. Luka isnt either and most of my friends who aren't into the NBA probably don't even know anything about Durant, either."
"Shai, Murray, and Embiid don't count. They're not from Europe.  Out of all the active European players in the NBA right now, these are the best ones under 30: Antetokounmpo, Doncic, Jokic, Gobert, Sabonis, Porzingis, Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Schroeder, Valanciunas, Anunoby, Markkanen/Poeltl.  So your starters would be Luka, Bogdan, Sabonis, Giannis, Gobert. Best pieces off the bench would be Jokic, Vucevic, Anunoby, Schroeder, Valanciunas, Porzingis, Markkanen/Poeltl.  They'd go pound for pound against USA, with USA having better depth despite them having no real superstar.   \- That defense is obviously better tho (since their centers aren't turnstiles on D, plus they have better wing defenders too, Mikal and Murphy are gonna be so good), and they got good playmakers too (Young/Suggs/Mitchell/Booker can run an offense to an extent, we can put someone like Cade here if we want some playmaking).   \- USA got better shooters (duh), better perimeter defense (Europe's good defensive wings are Anunoby, Bogdan and Giannis, and even then Giannis isn't really an excellent on ball defender since he feasts on help defense; the rest are decent/average/bad) and USA, they're a jack of all trades master of none team (can do pretty much everything).   \- Europe could heavily depend on Luka PNR with Gobert/Giannis (Gobert hasn't developed an offensive game outside of catching lobs, and Giannis can run the PNR only when Gobert is off the floor since he clogs the paint) or Giannis drive &amp; kick (which can easily be countered since USA can just use the wall, they have the sizeable players with good defense that can set this up). They don't have that many catch and shoot guys, these guys are more creators of their own offense.  \- Porzingis is a shooting guard in a center's body, Sabonis, JV, Vucevic, and Jokic are bad at defense (but their offense is better than USA's), Markkanen has regressed since his rookie days, Poeltl hasn't shown much offensive upside yet but his defense is really good.  &amp;#x200B;  So take that as you will. I think I'm favoring US here, since they have the versatility on both ends of the floor. Defensively, Europe would heavily struggle if they needed stops but offensively they could outshoot team USA."
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."

*Luka Doncic*
You forgot Luka Doncic
"[Charania] Final: Beginning with the 2021-22 season, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Jimmy Butler and James Harden will no longer play in the NBA, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium."
How about best non-Trae shooter in the class and above average defender with upside if he can gain athleticism?  https://www.sactownroyalty.com/platform/amp/2018/6/18/17359186/nba-draft-2018-scouting-profile-luka-doncic-trust-the-prophecy
Some are calling him the dark-skinned Luka Doncic.
I think shai is better than Tatum but that’s up for debate. Doncic is one of those”luka/lebrons” literally lol. I’d argue Zion is as well so that basically leaves trae lamelo and ja who are all #1 pick worthy guys. Basically what I’m saying is they might as well not swing for the fences by trading their young budding star. This rumor makes as much sense as the twolves trading KAT. Like you already have a star the hard parts done why trade them
Trae Young putting up 30 point 10 assist games  Luka Doncic putting up 30 point 10 assist 10 reb games  Jarrett Allent averaging 13 points and 10 rebounds per game  One of these things is not like the other.
Luka Doncic's dad isn't even named Luka Doncic. What kind of shitshow are they running in Slovenia. Bust.
"Luka Doncic, just so incredibly skilled at such a young age.  His game is also entertaining as hell, with step back threes, euro steps, and insane passes."
He's available in the same way that Luka Doncic is available. Trade us the #1 pick and every pick for the next decade.
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
Luka Doncic - Klay Thompson - Kawhi Leonard - Zion Williamson - PJ Washington.
"Idk, this Luka Doncic guy had a solid game for Slovenia the other night"
"I mean, the Mavs had the same idea that we did when we first brought him in. Be a perimeter defender and someone to be spoon-fed 3’s by ~~Ben Simmons~~ Luka Doncic."
I mean what’s the point of trading SGA + MORE compensation for Cade? Isn’t SGA everything you want in an offensive player? His efficiency numbers were insane on a G-League level roster. Lock him up for the foreseeable future and start using some of that draft capital to start building a winner.  Seems dumb to just get Cade to be in control of him for cheap on his rookie contract. I understand that you want that super sexy optimal Luka Doncic situation where you can build around a superstar on a cheap contract but why risk it? Cade may or may not pan out and SGA is already clearly a deserving max player and a cornerstone type talent.
"If it makes you feel better, before Luka Doncic showed up at our doorsteps, Mavs fans were getting excited about Dennis Smith Jr. It gets worse before it gets better but maybe the Spurs will draft well the next few seasons and get back in the conversation for contention!"
Trae Young / LaMelo Ball / Tyrese Haliburton  Luka Doncic / Lu Dort / Desmond Bane  Michael Porter Jr / DeAndre Hunter / Duncan Robinson  Jaren Jackson Jr / John Collins / PJ Tucker  DeAndre Ayton / Xavier Tillman / Isaiah Stewart
"I agree on Bagley being picked over Doncic, literally one of the most baffling thing I have ever seen.  About the ""experts"" some are making draft predictions, predicting who would pick who rather than saying who SHOULD go there, while others are just expressing their preference. Some do a little of both actually weighting their opinion on where they think each pick will go.  The King's signaled they were picking Bagley no. 2 before they did it. A lot of people saw that and adjusted their mock drafts and draft preferences accordingly.  I think everyone who wanted Bagley over Luka has been fired now by the King's organization.  They actually fired their head coach partially due to him pushing for Doncic. Apparently he was absolutely against drafting Bagley to the point where it caused issues within the team. New head coach and Bagley wants out still. Not drafting Luka had an enormous multi-year fallout. As bad as the Blazers passing on Jordan."
M - Luka  A - Doncic  V  S
&gt;Plays in Europe?  &gt;Can hit shots off a Luka Doncic pass?  Welcome to the Dallas Mavericks
"Since it's a lottery only your odds of getting a top pick go up, it's not guaranteed. The King's stay mediocre, we haven't purposefully tanked to improve our odds . We won the lottery a few years back tho and got the number two pick, we then  decided to draft Marvin Bagley. Over Luka Doncic"
Luka Doncic will win all 3 mvps next season
"Hawks traded back from the opportunity to draft LUKA DONCIC and they rightfully aren't getting fried for it. Why? Because their guy panned out too. Cade, Green, and Mobley should all be great, so the question is how much the Pistons get on top of Green/Mobley when evaluating a prospective trade."
Luka Doncic will get called for multiple technical fouls
Unless your name is Luka doncic
"I think neither of your two choices really has a shot at winning MVP this year. Giannis and the Bucks should be focusing on post-season success, which means a lot more strategic rest during the regular season. They might still finish with the #1 seed in the East, but I think voter fatigue is going to stop him from winning. He'll get noise (the same way LeBron will get noise if the Lakers are #1) but ultimately it's not going to go to him.  Similarly, Harden is never going to win MVP playing in Durant's shadow.  I think the only guys who are going to win will be Jokic IF both he and his team improve (which basically means Jamal Murray doesn't get injured again) and whoever wins the league scoring title. That could be Beal, it could be Curry, it could be Dame. Or some young helio-centric player like Doncic or Luka."
Luka Doncic…
"So, the only place I’ve seen it is a Zach Lowe article (and god, this took longer to find because of ESPN’s bizarre lack of archives), [but it’s the first video under #7](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28482160/ten-nba-things-like-including-luka-doncic-dwight-powell-dance) Although it’s probably under a pay wall, so I’m not sure what else."
"luka doncic, I think he is a great player who will have a great career, but people are already lumping him in the same category as Dirk or some of the other great euro players and it’s just way too early."
"It’s pretty damn funny, but I’ve always thought that he has one of the nicest smiles when it’s candid. I think he just doesn’t know how to fake smile for cameras yet. I didn’t learn until I hit 30 and got practice in all my friends wedding pictures.  Luka does something similar on ‘posed’ shots, like his player pic or when he accepts a trophy or something https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic  But they both look genuine when it’s a candid pic https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/PuhZgV0J7JGkNDlUv0hkkt02GZY=/1024x650/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/CLUCIJEKNBCN7FKXCFLDYEWSO4.JPG"

"Past Golden State? I'm betting. That will be a fun series for sure, Shaq would pick apart the Toronto defense in the finals if he gets there. That'll be like his 2000 Indiana numbers but amplified combined with Luka Doncic, rim running DJ as the backup, and Dirk's unexpected postseason tour, I'd like to see that."
Luka Doncic with Josh Greens hustle and defense
"Thanks for the analysis.  Just one comment, not so against your analysis, more Vs the wider expectations. More specifically you wrote  &gt; Although Doncic is only 22 years old, he's expected to be in the heart of his prime as he enters his 4th season in the NBA.  IMO he is 5-6 years away from his prime. It sounds scary, however there is a reason that player's prime start at the age of 26-27 and over. It has (mostly) to so with the fact that they are still ""there"" athletically , however skill wise they (typically) are above and above all are quite familiar with how the league works at this point, they are starting to act more like veterans all the while still having most if not all of their agility/speed/change of direction prowess... Experience is huge for the league, that's how you can get people in their late 30s still be contributors, their accumulated knowledge makes them valuable despite their physical decline.  And secondly (of course), MVP is as much about team performance as it is for individual performance. I just don't think that Mavs' summer moves turned them into contenders or anything close. In fact I have absolutely no idea what Cuban and co does. They hit the jackpot by drafting Luka, yet seem to have a hard time to finding talent around him. Which IMO should make no sense, Dallas is a huge city so players should not be too averse to play there, all the while they get the chance to play alongside one of the best players in the world already. Again, I don't know what Cuban does, but whatever that may be, he is not contending meaning that Doncic's chance to an MVP is actually extremely low.  In short I have no idea why he starts the preseason as a favourite for two years in a row now. IMO he is easily one of the least likely to win it as far as top 10 players go. Definitely not the most...  BTW I do agree that Antetokounmpo is the best deal, as well. He is in the best position as long as the Bucks do not experience a 2021 Miami Heat style capitulation (i.e. if they compete to their level)..."
Checks Luka Doncic playoff ppg: 33.5  Good lord.
"Okay, I see where Kuzma’s coming from in a way. Luka does get away with what have been called a travel back in the day.   At the same time Kuzma’s a player who gets 13 points on 11 shots a night. Doncic gets 28 points on 20 shots per night. Doncic isn’t god’s gift to basketball but he’s really good and also very young with room to improve."
"A rabbit hole was dug above when posters got into why Kuzma hates on Doncic every so often. They're guessing Kuzma is mixed, which in turn, possibly makes him hate Luka for being white.   Now other people are sharing their experiences being mixed race and how they were treated. Possibly emboldening this theoretical racist Kuzma topic."
"This is some revisionist history. Chris Paul was an incredible/highly above average athlete.   Y'all sleeping on my guy in his prime, you don't rack up that many All-Defensive teams and steals by having 'Luka Doncic foot speed' and you sure as shit don't overcome multiple nagging injuries and keep hopping at an All-NBA level without a high level of athleticism to begin with, especially as a guy who's 5'11"" on a good day IRL."
"Someone get this man xD Where is he at today?    Also that one slide  &gt;They put Giannis's lil bro on Mike James because Doncic was getting embarrassed  Ehm, excuse me? Luka played with 0 of Giannis's bros in Europe. Literally just talking without having watched anything at the time, in that series Thanasis (which i assume is the one he is referring too) played for the opposing team Panathinaikos and was guarding Doncic."
"I'm not dissing Trae and Ayton, i think they're great and will continue to grow  But Luka Doncic is arguably the most accomplished teenager ever and he continues to be best player from that draft comfortably  it's just wild to me that his skill was so ignored, Trae isn't any better athletically or on D and they still went for him and a pick  I don't know, it's just weird for me because none of the teams were contending before and taking Luka #1 seemed like a no brainer"
"As seen in the Luka Doncic post from earlier today, NBA players are afraid of Euros coming over and having success and taking over too much of the league. Dragan was actually too good and so the players got together and quietly blackballed him from playing, forcing him to have to go take a contract in Tel Aviv."
&gt;I was a Fan of Luka Doncic at first but the more I watch the more I see somebody who struggles to get by guys off the bounce. Nobody in the League is watching a Euro come in and dribble ALL DAY the NBA aint the Euroleague  Hilarious. From a trainer. Who ideally helps mold NBA talent.

"I mean if you hate the country so much ... sure... my old country, China, also hates America lol  you can probably put it on the marketing campaign for Luka Doncic in China. We the Mavericks.. fuck USA"
Mavs-The Luka Doncic cutting fire wood copy pasta
"when we got Luka the mods hadn't put in player flair for the new draft picks so this was my ""Luka"" flair. but after awhile it grew on me since Radislav's one season for the Mavs was around when I started to watch basketball. it grew on me so I kept it when they added Luka Doncic flair."
"&gt; And even the Mavs didn’t predict Luka would be this great.  I think a lot of people saw GOAT as a realistic possibility for Luka.   - Kevin Pelton in 2018: ""his projection by my stats-based model is not only best in this year's draft but the best for any prospect I have rated dating back to 2003"" [source](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/23581610/is-luka-doncic-top-three-2018-nba-draft-pick) - Mike Schmitz: Luka Doncic was the best prospect he ever saw [source](https://thesmokingcuban.com/2020/04/21/mavericks-luka-doncic-schmitz-prospect/) - Dean Demakis in Feb 2017 (lol): ""Is Luka Doncic The Best Prospect Ever?"" [source](https://deanondraft.com/2017/02/03/is-luka-doncic-the-best-prospect-ever/)"
"What do Mikal Bridges and Royce O'Neale have in common when it comes to their offensive role? Standing in the (weakside) corner.  Who was assigned to guard them when they played Portland? Damian Lillard.  Mikal Bridges and Royce O'Neale were also the primary defenders assigned to guarding Dame.  Who was assigned to guard Mikal and Royce when they played Dallas? Luka Doncic.  That doesn't make Lillard a SF. It doesn't make Mikal a PG. That's because Luka and Dame have the same role on defence -- *stand vaguely near the weakside corner shooter and theoretically help on drives, but ideally take a break.*   Lillard doesn't pressure opposing ball-handlers all game long. PatBev does it a lot. Rubio does it sometimes. They have very different defensive roles because they have different skills and play in different schemes.  You're idealising things to the point where they no longer real relation to reality. Fine. You do you. But as useless as positions in the NBA of today, at least on offence the PG position is as well defined as any -- bring the ball over half court, run the largest chunk of PnRs, decide where the ball goes.  At the end of the day the only person for whom it matters who plays at which position is the head coach of that team. That's why positions exists -- so the coach can more efficiently organise players into a cohesive whole. And Carlisle was adamant Luka plays PG as far as he's concerned, and he was the only one whose opinion on the matter mattered."
"genius idea, I can't think of a better way to encourage parity than to add DeAndre Ayton or Luka Doncic to the 2017 Warriors"
"Yes, not just a little but massively.   Harden is a choker and a loser but Luka ""Lose in the First Round Every Single Season"" Doncic is the ultimate winner."
"Other than Lavine, maybe Coby White? Would hate to lose him but I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t trade him for an all star lol. Thaddeus Young is one of my favorite players in the league but he already got traded sadly.   The only answer is Lavine. Unless we got like Luka Doncic back I’d feel like crying lol."
Luka Doncic
Luka had a hand in kawhi’s face almost every time kawhi made a shot. Kawhi was just on god mode that series and doncic was too tired in the 4th from carrying the team on his back.
"Well.. does a pairing “work” if they make it to the ECF twice and have some good regular seasons? By that logic the Derozan-Lowry pairing “worked” and trading Demar for Kawhi was pointless. I realize Tatum/Brown are younger than Lowry/Derozan were, but it’s a little early to say the pairing is too good to be broken up. Especially if the guy you’d get back is Luka Doncic."
"Doncic and Harden are in the same defensive trajectory imo. They don't have the quickness or the cardio to sustain high defensive engagement while carrying a major load on offense. But they have the positional strength advantage to defend well against stationary shot attempts near the rim, and they have both improved their defensive awareness as their careers progressed. You can see both of them defending quite admirably at the end of close games. But in the middle of the game, you can see them watching those same cuts and pops with barely any urgency to cover the ground between them and the shooter. Harden's over the hill now but for Luka, resolving his cardio and defensive effort issues will be the difference between a Harden type career and a Lebron type career."
“Toronto is not my preferred destination. I have higher ambitions. We'll see.”  “Maybe I would really end my career together with Luka Doncic in a Dallas Mavericks jersey.”  Definitely dreaming.
Australia has a much more stacked roster than Slovenia and it’s not even close. Luka came straight from the playoffs where he was playing 40.1 minutes per game.   Also he didn’t have better averages. But way to just make shit up and prove my point that you don’t know what you’re talking about lol.   Patty: http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/player/Patty-Mills  Luka: http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/player/Luka-Doncic
"&gt;  Luka: He is not close to being a top 5 player. He's in the same tier as Lillard, Kyrie, and Trae as a borderline top 10 player.   You know you don't know what you're talking about when you lump Luka Doncic in the same tier as Kyrie and Trae"
Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic is very clearly the greatest young player right now but he could also be the most overrated. Many people projecting him to be top 20 all-time or something but it's very possible for him to hit a plateau and just never get that good.
a 6'7 PG that does it all... His already in the league his name is Luka Doncic!
Neither. Give me Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic.   Not because of his NBA career really but because of his play for the Slovenian NT and because of his Euroleague career.
"They don’t only do that for the second round, look at Houston this year for example. [Houston acquired the 24th pick and got Josh Christopher with it](https://youtu.be/vHt3caPl-04)  The actual verbiage of the Luka trade is this;  Atlanta receives *The draft rights* to Trae Young and a 2019 protected FRP  Dallas receives *The draft rights* to Luka Doncic  Id say “draft rights” is closer to being a player than a pick but it’s all semantics"
"it’s one draft pick technically speaking. It would’ve been 3 if the picks were traded before the players were selected.  At the time of the trade, the Hawks had Luka Doncic and Dallas had Trae Young and a first. Practically speaking it was 3 firsts because Atlanta told Dallas who to draft at 5, but by the letter of the law it’s 1"
"&gt;i repeat, the hawks did not agree to trade their 3rd pick for the mavs' 5th and their 2019 first    The 2018 NBA Draft-day transaction that sent the Atlanta Hawks‘ first-round pick, Luka Doncic, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for their first-round pick, Trae Young, and an additional first-round selection the following year will always be a hot topic for debate.  &gt;the hawks did not agree to trade their 3rd pick for the mavs' 5th and their 2019 first. they didn't know if the player they wanted, trae, would be available at 5.  Just because there was a contingency doesn't mean the 3rd and 5th picks weren't traded for each other during the draft."
"&gt;The 2018 NBA Draft-day transaction that sent the Atlanta Hawks‘ first-round pick, Luka Doncic, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for their first-round pick, Trae Young, **and an additional first-round selection** the following year will always be a hot topic for debate.  Additional means 2.   The trade involving 3 total picks was agreed on before Doncic was selected.  This is by far the dumbest argument I've ever seen on here."
"&gt;if you want to consider an already drafted trae young as a first round pick,  Oh my God. Trae was a first round pick. Cam was first round pick. Doncic was a first round pick. Two firsts were traded for one.  &gt; therefore according to your logic, it didn't cost two firsts to get luka, it cost two firsts to get one first.  Those are exactly the same thing. It cost 2 first round picks (Cam and Trae) to get 1 first round pick, Doncic.  &gt;so literally only one pick was exchanged.  Wrong, 3 first round picks were exchanged total.  &gt;The 2018 NBA Draft-day transaction that sent the Atlanta Hawks‘ first-round pick, Luka Doncic, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for their first-round pick, Trae Young, and an additional first-round selection the following year will always be a hot topic for debate."
it cost trae and one (1) pick to get doncic. trae and luka were already drafted when the trade happened
"FWIW, Luka Doncic has had 3 years of meh on/off stats now which is the main stat people often point to as ""making team better"" if there is one. It is the last stat that the critics point at as it is rare for someone who has such GOAT comparisons to be be that mediocre in that regard."
&gt;Doncic  I'm pretty damn sure Luka believes he's the best player out there. Dude is 22 and already was selected for the All-NBA 1st Team twice.
"Do you think the Mavs are lasting more than 5 seconds on a phone call with another GM that utters the words ""Luka"" or ""Doncic""?  If he's on the trading market then he's expendable to the team and not as highly valued."
"It's inaccurate to say that all we know of rookies is their statlines. James Harden had significantly better signs of isolation scoring and three-point creation, was stronger and had much better athleticism, and showed signs of making tough execution passes both in transition and in the halfcourt. He also only played 22 minutes in 0 starts where Haliburton played 30, so tossing his statline out there without adjusting for minutes played is misleading.  Haliburton's stats mostly came off good secondary role execution. Lots of spot-up threes, some good passing to cutters and rollers, some but not a huge amount of playmaking in transition, very few isolation attempts, very little self-creation, and the creation for others was limited in its depth (e.g., does not have the speed to consistently create off a drive/kick). Not a great point of attack defender and sometimes finds himself out of position.  When you view the game film, it's not nonsensical. It's a whole years worth of footage showing what he's good at and what he has potential in. His skillset (i.e. skillset, not potential) is moreso Malcolm Brogdon than James Harden or Luka Doncic. Maybe someone like Mike Conley if he puts it together really well defensively. Again, easily a top 5 player in this class. But if it's not fair to say his upside is limited, it's not fair to assume - as everyone seems to be - that he's already an all-star/all-NBA lock. It's a just a little pre-emptive."
Luka Doncic?
next lebron may honestly be luka doncic  although he is more like the first luka (or the second harden lol)
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
"&gt;I had him 3rd in my draft ***after*** Ayton and Doncic  After Ayton and Doncic. I think my top 5 were Ayton, Doncic, Bagley, Trae Young, Michael Porter Jr /Jaren Jackson Jr in that order. I was really high on Luka since early on for the same reason I was really high on Sengun this draft. Also really liked MPJ despite his back problems, I wanted the Mavs to take him at 5 and was really surprised to see him fall that low."
"Yeah - and how does the closest comp make any sense?  19 year old LaMelo as a rookie - 16/6/6.  19 year old Doncic as a rookie - 21/8/6.  That's a pretty big gap as a rookie, and I can't fathom LaMelo making the kind of 2nd year leap that Luka did.  We all know RAPTOR and every other 538 model is broken, so it's not surprising that this will be too."
"Robert Williams.  Sounds crazy, but I'll explain...  &gt;  Lebron James, James Harden, Nikola Jokic, and Luka Doncic are all triple double machines as well.  Problem with all these guys is they'll never get the blocks.  Lebron and Jokic, for example, have career highs of 5 blocks.  And 10 steals is bordering on impossible - it's only happened about 20 times in NBA history total - it's more flukey than anything.  So if we accept the next quadruple double is coming from points/rebounds/assists/blocks, you're really limited to big men who are terrific blockers, and specifically ones who can pass.  That's where Williams comes in.  He's hit highs of 9 blocks and 8 assists in separate games playing 22 minutes.  Most people realize he's an elite blocker, but they don't know how good of a passer he is.  He'll get the points and rebounds regularly, and I believe he'll triple double numerous times with either blocks or assists - so all it will take is one big game where he throws it all together.  Note I'm not saying this *will* happen - I just think he's got as good of a chance as anybody in the league right now."
"For sure, I think the Clippers suffer from a few issues. First and foremost was Kawhi’s injury. If he stays healthy there, we could’ve possibly been talking about a Clippers championship right now.  I like the Mavs a lot, huge Doncic and also Cuban fan, but I think they need to replace Porzingis. Dude is too injury prone and Luka needs another solid star next to him. If they can do that, they’re a top team in the league. Luka is so young and so talented, there’s so much time there, especially now with him signing a max extension.  I think a second round exit for the Bulls would be huge. For one, it gives Lavine 2 playoff series’ of experience he otherwise wouldn’t have. Second, it probably makes him resign. They can address the needs in the off-season and make another run.  Side note: I think them adding Derrick Jones Jr as another defender off the bench just increased the deadliness of this team. They’ve now got a great mix of young athletic guys and solid veterans."
"and then when they do talk about the player that got drafted, they show more highlights of a guy already in the NBA that one of their analysts thinks that player compares to than highlights of the player drafted.  ""Cade could be like Luka Doncic, so here's a bunch of Luka Doncic highlights"""
I wish I could turn Marvin Bagley into Luka Doncic.
What Bron is doing and what Luka is doing are wildly different.  Bron states his case.  Complains or speaks up on behalf of his team.  Luka throws a spoiled brat tantrum and talks shit.  That's why super star Luka Doncic gets techs ALL THE TIME.  Very VERY different.
"“Blazers looking at Package for James Harden, Stephen Curry, and Luka Doncic”  I can do it too"
"again though, like i said, mpj is nearly as good as murray at this point (if you want proof, he averaged 22 post all star break) he averaged more points him and jokic are probably superior to doncic and porzingis who cant play more than 60 games in a season. until luka gets a co-star that actually plays hes just going to hit the fifth or sixth seed. the nuggets on the other hand can be just as good if not better for the first half of the season and when murray is back, which by your estimate would be january to february, they will be much better than the mavericks."
"I agree. I don’t think the Mavs are a particularly good team at all, even with Doncic. So far, every time they take the floor, they have a top offense, which is dependent on Luka being on the floor, and an abysmal, league worst defense which can’t stop a nose bleed. Dependent on second options like THJ… just not a ton of depth or talent at all. Playoff caliber, yes, but I don’t expect much more out of them unless Luka goes Olympic-level unconscious."
"This is so stupid. He leads the NBA in 3 points generated.  This sub only values scoring and can’t comprehend points generated. [Simmons leads the league with 93 assists on three-pointers, seven ahead of the next-closest player (Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic). He also ranks seventh leaguewide in total points generated from his assists (427).](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/bryantoporek/2021/02/07/what-makes-ben-simmons-invaluable-to-the-philadelphia-76ers/amp/). It’s also not a small sample size. Since 2017 he leads the NBA in 3 points generated ahead of Westbrook. He may be a liability scoring but calling him an offensive liability is asinine."
Luka Doncic
"Luka doncic, Michael Jordan, Carmelo Anthony, Larry bird, magic Johnson, wilt chamberlain,"
Jimmy Butler   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Russell Westbrook   Damian Lillard   Luka Doncic   Joel Embiid
"Going on a limb here, but Luka Doncic"
"I know we'll get a lot of stories about LeBron being old and the Lakers STACKING their roster with....a player who people have said isn't a winner for the last decade and bench guys from other teams?  But, let's not forget the reality of this past postseason. The Lakers were up 2-1 vs the Suns before AD got hurt. I view the Lakers as the favorite.  There's also the Clippers. The took the Suns to six in the WCF without Kawhi.  Denver is getting Murray back.  Steph is getting Klay back (at some point) and the Warriors would be stupid to not trade some of their youngsters for a win-now guy (unless it's for Simmons.)  The Mavs have done nothing to help Luka, but Doncic is also young enough where he can still do the ""LeBron in Cleveland"" thing and make his team perform way better than should be humanly possible just because he's there.  Not only do I think the Lakers should be the favorites heading into next season, but I think Phoenix is much more likely to win zero playoff series than to make the Finals again."
Yes they do his name is luka doncic
"It certainly does at some point. But you can't look at shooting percentage in a vacuum. Context matters and if for example a guy takes difficult shots and makes them often enough (like Trae does) keeps the defense honest it will indirectly easier shots. Both for the player himself (by opening a driving a lane) and for his teammates by forcing help in places where you usually wouldn't need it.  Luka Doncic and LeBron James are even better examples because they shoot poorer percentages than Trae from downtown, but they are so dangerous on drives it's important they keep the threat of a 3 pointer alive.   It's why people think that Simmons shooting 20% from 3 would be fine if he'd take them when wide open, because right now the defense is just ignoring him. I don't agree with that in his specific case (because I reckon he's *too* poor from downtown) but it's the same argument."
"I could name fifteen better playmakers just from guys who played against Kobe lol. But from all-time, this is a pretty indisputable fifteen above him:  John Stockton, Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Lebron James, Steph Curry, Jason Kidd, Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson, Mark Jackson, Deron Williams, Bob Cousy, Rajon Rondo, Isiah Thomas, James Harden, Tony Parker.   Not to mention guys like Jokic, Trae Young, Luka Doncic who are just starting their careers but clearly already better playmakers… or controversial inclusions like Westbrook…"
I really want Coby White to be an allstar in the next 6 years   luka doncic will win a ring in the first season after he leaves dallas
Luka motha fuckin Doncic
Kemba probably doesn't count since he was with my team for 8 years. I'm going with Russell Westbrook or Luka Doncic
"Patrick Beverly, Marcus Smart, Lowry, CP3, in that order. Though I don't think the gulf between Lowry and CP3 is as huge as some others make it out to be.  Also Chris Boucher, Brandon Ingram and Kevin Durant.  Also Cade Cunningham, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic."

Anthony Bennet  LeBron James  Luka Doncic

trae young &gt; luka doncic &gt; james harden
Ben Simmons -&gt; Luka Doncic -&gt; Lebron
"If 2013 lebron was on let’s say the cavs he’d get any singular player in the league plus the maximum amount of draft capital.  This is only if he demanded a trade and was committed to sitting out, otherwise he just plain wouldn’t be traded no matter what.  The exceptions are doncic and Giannis because they’re clearly the two best assets in the league and no one else can beat that so they wouldn’t need to overpay as much. Giannis + 2 firsts would probably get it done. Luka plus a first might get it done for the extra year of cap space plus a longer period of team control.   Okc would trade every decent pick that isn’t their own for the best youngish player they could get, pair him with sga, and then add in 2 or 3 of their own firsts and probably win the sweepstakes. So it would end up being something like Simmons plus sga plus 3 firsts for lebron.    Actually that probably doesn’t beat the Luka offer but okc could go even further."
"They are referring to the fact that Vlade Divac, GM of the Sacramento Kings, passed on Luka in the 2018 draft with the 2nd pick, instead taking Marvin Bagley. This left Luka Doncic still on the board, who was picked by Atlanta right after, then immediately traded to Dallas (for Trae Young). The point is Sacramento has not made good basketball decisions in quite some time and has become a very memable team to poke fun at, well, because kangz"
"Not until Luka Doncic retires, Kings been hexed."
Imagine Luka Doncic turning into strictly a 3 and D guy. That's Grant Hill.
"Luka “The Matador, El Matador, Cool Hand, The Don, Wonder Boy, El Niño Maravilla, Swaggy L, Luka Legend, Too Easy” Doncic"
Was catching up with a buddy and started talking sports and he was like “I don’t know if you know him but luka doncic is like this really good player on Dallas and-“  I was like 🤔🤔🤔
"Luka Doncic, Domantas Sabonis, Larry Bird, and Steve Nash"
"Given what he had already shown in only 4 years in the league, I think they must have made a bet that he would have a phenomenal career.  That's something to consider when picking players for the 75-man roster.  Couldn't a player like Luka Doncic already be added with the same approach as for Shaq?"
"Michael Jordan without Pippen has won the same amount of playoff series as Luka Doncic. Impressive company for Luka, future goat confirmed?"
If Luka Doncic liked a photo of Hitler would it be a different story?
Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic.
Doncic is like Slovenian for Duncan though. For all we know Luka is Duncan's nephew.
"Cade Cunningham will be better than Michael Jordan  Luka Doncic will be better than Cade Cunningham  Anthony Davis fakes injuries during bad games so that he can get high in the locker room   Blake Griffin is a serial killer  Kawhi didn't choke against the Nuggets, his knees couldn't handle the strain and he'll never get passed the 2nd round without copious amounts of rest during the playoffs   From watching Harlem Globetrotter games in the 70s, I can tell that NBA players back then were certainly capable of being great ball handlers by today's standards, and not untalented white dudes who couldn't dribble like people on here say. Frankly, the strict rules did not allow them to do things with the ball that players are allowed to do now.   Steph Curry's foot fetish is breaking his family apart  Fox is a future superstar because he's an insanely efficient finisher for a point guard; he's just too good at the rim  When Zion plays in the 2024 Olympics, it's over. His game is absolutely made for Olympic ball. He brings the finishing and physicality that no one on Team USA had."
"What I'm saying, mind you, is based on the play patterns of a group of players with a few hundred, at most, NBA games under their belts. It also relies on Derrick White staying healthy for the majority of the season which is certainly not a safe bet.   Projecting the playing time and rate distribution for a team over the course of an entire season is difficult and the difficultly level grows exponentially with each piece in the rotation that is adjusted.   For example, if you asked me to give you the likelihood of a player leading the Dallas Mavericks in possessions used next season I would break it down something like this:   Luka Doncic - 95%  THJ - 2.5%  Kristaps Porzingis - 1.5%   Other - 1%  If I was answering the question for the Spurs it would look, roughly, like this:   Derrick White - 35%  Dejounte Murray - 30%  Keldon Johnson - 19%   Lonnie Walker - 7%   Tre Jones - 3%  Josh Primo - 2%   Devin Vassell - 1.5%   Other - 2.5%"
"...also, the Hornets at 46 wins? LaMelo is good, but he's not going to have a Luka Doncic level season, is he? He shot their team out of as many wins as he shot them into wins... and if they're relying on Bouknight, and Mason Plumlee and Oubre?? Not a 46 win team at all. I would pick the Bulls over them, for sure, and definitely the Heat."
"&gt; Minus their big  No one is going to infer you are talking about Luka Doncic by just saying ""big"". Take the L and keep it moving. Talking about ""I'll pray you make friends"" lmfao stfu"

Gonna do Current only  PG - Steph Curry  SG - Donte Divincenzo  F - Mikal Bridges   F - Luka Doncic  C - Joel Embiid
It’s very funny the Suns took a guy they aren’t interested in giving the max over Luka Doncic
"Because he didn't meet or exceed expectations. Expectations for the #1 pick are to be able to be the top guy on a playoff team, a la Luka Doncic/Trae Young. Ayton showed that he could be a complementary piece to one of the best Guard tandems in the NBA, which is nice, but not living up to #1 expectations."
"James harden, giannis, Kyrie Irving,  kawhi Leonard, Joel embiid, Kevin Durant, Luka doncic, jayson Tatum, Jimmu butler, Paul George, jokic, Chris Paul, lillard   The list can go on and on"
Have you seen this Luka Doncic kid?  Did you see him in the Olympics?  Or the mavs offense second half of the season?  Crap roster with a hobbled KP and still almost knocked off the Clippers.  Kawhai had to put up a monumental 2 way effort to drag clippers to the next round.  And coach?  Luka runs the show out there anyway.  Has the ball 90% of the time.  Some minor roster improvements and healthier key players from last season.  And Luka is expected to take another step forward.  He's maybe 5th best player in the league now?  Easy top 10.
"&gt; the max ayton can get is like $33M/year.  Not quite. You're going off the '21-'22 cap of 112.4, but these extensions are based on the '22-'23 cap of 119, so his max *starting salary* is 35.7, and he can get 8% raises on that, so if he makes all-NBA next year he could extend for the same 5/207 number that you saw reported for Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  I can see why the person you're replying to is calling Ayton's desired 5/207 ""almost double"" JJJ's 4/105.  (Although JJJ will probably sign another contract north of 20 million AAV while Ayton would be on the fifth year of this extension)"
Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic he is the Don
Luka Doncic: kicked a dude in the nuts once also known as Dong-kick
"https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-jason-kidd-reveals-kristaps-porzingis-start-camp-news-luka-doncic  &gt;When discussing the role that Kidd envisions Porzingis playing in the Mavericks' offense alongside Luka Doncic, he made it clear he wants him to _just be a 'basketball player'_ and 'there's no bad shot' for him."
Similarly I had a guy telling me Trae Young was a better player than Luka Doncic because he set some records in the playoffs and got further.  Anything to ignore stats I guess lol
"you know, if i was luka doncic, i think i'd be as good as luka doncic too"
Luka “Lowry Booty” Doncic
"Luka Doncic for MVP is a sucker's bet, just like it was last year."
MVP: Luka Doncic   DPOY: Rudy Gobert   6MOY: Jordan Clarkson   ROY:  Jalen Green   MIP: Michael Porter Jr
Luka Doncic FMVP
Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Luka Doncic  Deadass those are the only players I could see an argument for being better than Lowry. And I don't even agree on some of them. If you think LaMelo Ball or Mike Conley is better than Lowry boy IDK what's wrong with you.
"Well my bad for the Mvp point. Definitely felt much closer during the season.   As for Embiid’s performance, he had 5+ TOs in each of the last 3 games, 8 in Game 6 and 7 each. That’s more games with 5+ TOs than Luka had throughout the entire 7 games vs LA. To make it worse for him, he went 0-12 from the field in the 2nd half along with an open missed game-winning layup in game 4. Joel just did too much negative things during pivotal games that series as compared to Luka to put him over Doncic.   No knock on Joel, but he isn’t Top 5 going into this season. However, I’m confident that he can definitely break that ceiling very soon, maybe even by the end of this season."
"The Nuggets should be fine w/o Murray. They're not better than the other top teams, but they're not that much worse.  Dallas did not take a step back. Coaching only goes so far - they still have extreme talent and Luka Doncic. Carlisle also loved to mess with his early lineups, which often leads to a slow start and lesser reg season wins. This is also the first year in how many that Porzingis is starting healthy. That is huuuge.  The Blazers did get better but I'm not surprised people dont see it. Larry Nance is a very serviceable player, and their bench has improved. Basically if the Blazers bench doesnt give up all the points they should be at the very least a decent regular season team.  The Warriors are much, much better this season, and are actually competing to win from the outset. Theyll be very good.  Anyway I expect each of these teams, at the very least, to be marginally better than the Lakers. While the Lakers can outright win any playoff series, why would we expect them to be a regular season performer? Lebron is oooooold. So is 80% of the team. Will AD show up? What about WB? Will that work? Who can shoot the 3?  They shouldnt be favourites and betting odds actually look very realistic for the Lakers this year. If they hadnt gotten Monk and Nunn for peanuts theyd really be in trouble"
Tyler Herro &gt; Luka Doncic
I have my doubts the Mavs have any idea how to ever put a championship contending team around Luka Doncic.
Luka Doncic
I thought the best player of the 2018 draft would be Luka Doncic.  The second best? Mohammed Bamba
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
Lebrons still got an outside chance if he can win another ring or two.   Luka doncic is the only guy I see as having the ability. Giannis maybe a very small chance but is unlikely he gets close to how many championships he needs. He also needs to do what he did last playoffs another 8 times.
He has won a series but it is a huge stretch to say he’s done more in the playoffs than Luka. Doncic already has a couple of all time great scoring series and some tough clutch shots.
I agree luka doncic is purple skinned
"also I've heard it said many times before but it can't be reiterated enough. We get these players like Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc who become All Star/All NBA guys a few years into their careers and we forget that most guys take years to develop."
He’s not as iconic as Hawks legend Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic  CJ McCollum  Mikal Bridges  Miles Bridges  Clint Capela

"You missed my point entirely. If your premise is that anyone can be an all time great (which obviously isn’t true) then what’s the point in even talking about it.   It takes away the whole premise of the discussion.  What’s the point in even discussing “can Barnes be an all time great?” If you can apply it to everyone?    To have a valid discussion, the player needs to be worthy of it.  Not simply a player in the nba.   Think about how illogical you are being. Try doing this with another player “doncic has a chance to be all time great because anyone can be one… for example THJ can be an all time great too so why can’t Luka?”  See?  It’s stupid. You are saying (hoping) Barnes is a future  all time great simply on the fact that “anyone” can be and that’s flat out idiotic.   And of course it’s 100% based on who drafted him and the fact that you are absolutely a homer. This discussion wound be based around Suggs if Toronto drafted him 😂"

"Bro we have to take context into account.  Luka Doncic is a 6'7"" PG with shooting, finishing and playmaking. A 19 year old who became MVP of the second best league in the world with that kind of frame and playstyle is not something that comes along every year. Trae is 6'1"" with a small frame.   Plus, with the shift of the NBA to the more Euro-centric type of offenses, Luka just ticked all boxes. His main disadvantage is that the Euroleague doesn't get the same respect as the NCAA for some reason.  There's a reason why Luka was even considered to go #1 even after all the stigma with Euro players"
In the future it's Giannas and luka doncic you have to look out for. They will be the face of the nba winning the next 7 years. But nothing compares to that much talent of rarity that soccer had both goats at once lol.   It would basically be Mj getting drafted and then lebron in the next one going at it for 13 years. Only other time was kobe and Tim Duncan. For the 2000s is the closest or magic and bird in the 80s of back and forth.

"i feel like Luka Doncic is the best option when you consider that they need to be in a big market, with a clear playstyle, AND a catchy two-syllable name.  Obviously hes not the shooter Kobe/Curry are, but he takes plenty of shots, which is the important part."
"Nope, what Luka signed is also a supermax extension:  https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/sports/dallas-mavericks/luka-doncic-signs-207-million-supermax-extension-with-dallas-mavericks/2714938/#:~:text=Luka%20Doncic%20signed%20a%20%24207,Mavericks%20had%20agreed%20to%20terms.  Luka was eligible for the supermax extension because he made 2 first-team All-NBA's in his first 3 years in the league.  He is the first player ever eligible for the supermax extension off a rookie contract."
"Ayton is very deserving of being #1 pick, just not in a draft that has Luka Doncic"
"I kept on thinking about this.. but Vlade Divac received under the table money or other kind of favors to skip Luka Doncic in the draft. Other than that except plain stupidity, that’s the most plausible decision why such decision was made."

"Kevin Garnett  Allen Iverson  Micheal Jordan  Kobe Bryant  Reggie Miller  Honorable mentions: Luka Doncic, Jason Williams and Lonzo Ball (love his game and I was sad to see such an exciting prospect crumble under the pressure his father put on him)"
"Luka isnt a leader like CP3 is right now. This isn't 2K where we just simulate the game and the numbers get added up and boom you have a winner. What happens if Luka gets knocked out in the first round again this year? Can this sub pump the brakes if that happens? I know he is the great white hope but the upvotes on any comment that goes ""lUKa so gOoDt, right guys,"" has been annoying over the past year and a half for this sub in particular. Doncic hasn't done anything in the league but my man Book was still getting shit even tho we went to the Finals. Getting heated on a Sunday morning, lawd."

"Not sure why you got downvoted tbh.  I don't agree with your assessment but I respect your opinion, Russ knows his shit and I consider him a reliable source.  In response to your second point [here's a report](https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/how-bulls-used-halftime-film-session-slow-mavericks-luka-doncic) of Billy holding a film session during halftime (!) of a regular season game.  I'm only judging him on the basis of what I've seen him do with the Bulls, his tenure in OKC is not relevant to how he's been with us imho. Coaches get better as they coach so I would consider him better now than he was back then.  Monty Williams is considered one of the best head coaches in the league rn but it wasn't too long ago that he was being hired for tanking jobs and subsequently fired without mercy. At one point he was considered nothing more than a good assistant coach (just like Brett Brown is seen rn). Then bam, one great playoff run and suddenly he's among the best.  If the Bulls make a deep playoff run this year the narrative on Billy will begin to change."

"Jerry West has more scouting ability than just about anyone. For normal GM's and viewers, there was no way of knowing how good Luka would be. Ricky Rubio was playing the pro level at an even younger age in Doncic and had almost the exact same scouting report going into the NBA draft. Like, I could take quotes from both and mix them up and without checking you'd have no way of knowing which one the line was about. In 2009, the correct choice was to take the super-athletic American big man who dunked all over everyone and had incredible upside. (Blake Griffin) over the super-skilled prodigy from Euroleague, in 2018, in the same situation, the prodigy turned out to be better than the American big man. But you can't blame any normal GM for not knowing beforehand."

Someone who sucks off Luka Doncic online full time for a $0.00/hr salary telling me I'm nobody means less than nothing to me.
"Suggestion:  Instead of Luka Magic, can we go with Magic Doncic, and jut wait until, inevitably, Richard Jefferson calls him Magic Dongcic?  I feel like that would be worth it."
Luka Doncic would never flop like a bitch all the time every single game :)
"Ah yes, the famously under discussed Luka Doncic..."
"He's been getting shit on since his rookie year. It only stops after a good game, then it comes right back the next day. Dude literally gets discussed more than players that are way better than him, like Luka Doncic for example."
Luka Doncic but he pretty much had to. The entire team collapses without him. The MAVS blew a 19 point lead game 3 against the Clippers when Luka was out.
"It certainly helped Doncic, but our team as a whole couldn’t handle the small ball IMO. Similar to how the Clippers beat the Jazz, our big man just isn’t mobile enough to be effective when he’s drawn out to the perimeter - and isn’t dominant enough to punish the Clippers for going small. Doncic might have gotten to the rim easier, but they basically schemed Porzingis off the court.  And I definitely have faith the Mavs would continue to perform well through the playoffs; it would largely depend on if Luka could continue to shoulder the load. He was winning games by himself."
"Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball, Damian Lillard, and Luka Doncic for me."

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
Shaq took a Magic team from winning 25% of its games to winning 75% of its games and making the finals over that timespan and led the League in FG% and scoring in at least one of those seasons IIRC. You can argue about Shaq maybe getting a better supporting crew through that than Doncic has but the reality is that Shaq had already proven himself as an unreal floor raiser beyond just his absurd stats and Luka hasn’t turned his coal into diamonds just yet.

Luka Doncic? Great guy. Never met him.
That fan's name? Luka Doncic.   Feel old yet?
"You’re comparing Dame to the dude who ran the most efficient offense in NBA history in his second season. You may wanna rethink that argument… lol.   Any player with as high a usage rate as Doncic (similar to Harden) is going to have a high turnover rate. Maybe if the Mavs had another player on the team that can dribble he wouldn’t be put in those spots? I know you aren’t going to like that response, but those are the types of things that media people that don’t just look at stats (like you) actually understand. Is Dame a better playmaker than Harden because he had less turnovers? You need to really *think* about what these stats you’re spouting off *actually* mean. You can call the THJ response a straw man argument but it points out a clear flaw in your spreadsheet approach to rating basketball players.    If only that darn “media” saw it the way you do. They must really have it out for Dame! Maybe try to not have the “woe is me” attitude and realize that people that know more than you and I have had Luka ahead of Dame for *two years* now."
Because the panel of people selecting the team thought they were better? That doesn’t make it accurate. Again Luka Doncic and Andre Drummond got all defence votes. Shawn Marion has never got a selection despite routinely being a top 2-3 defensive wing. They’re far from an end all be all.   And yea Conley and Allen were excellent. Gasol was still more impactful than both. And Lebron had bosh battier and chalmers. All great defensive players but their team defence was much worse than Memphis
"And the same thing would occur if it happened with Gobert. The perception of a panel of judges making selective selections isn’t objective or factual. A players impact on the other hand, is.   Hell last year or the year prior, Luka Doncic and Andre Drummond got all defence votes. The opinions of those people are what you think is most important ? I’ll go with who was the biggest difference maker defensively.   Marc was not only the most impactful defender on his team, statistically he had a larger impact than Lebron (twice as large), Chandler (like literally fifteen times as large) and Noah (not a huge gap but 1-2 points better)"
"I don’t buy this. Why would the skills lean so heavily toward offense rather than NBA players being skilled at both offense and defense? There are multiple guys that have said that it is easier to score in the NBA than overseas. Luka comes to mind, and they specifically mentioned the rules/refs.  https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2019/02/09/why-mavericks-rookie-luka-doncic-says-it-s-easier-to-score-in-the-nba-than-in-europe/"
Luka Doncic is not a sure thing because he didn't play in the NCAA
Top 3 point guard? LOL get out of here. I can list a couple that are DEFINITELY and NO DOUBT better than Trae:  James Harden Chris Paul Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Kyle Lowry    Now which 4 are you kicking out to put Trae as top 3? LOL
"Except Luka Doncic, because apparently the Kings hate Luka"
"the question is not who is better rn, because that's obviously jokic  people don't seem to realize that luka is entering his 4th season, at this point in his career jokic didn't make the PO and wasn't an all star yet while luka is 2 time first all NBA already  progress is not linear but if we talking passage time luka is quite handly ahead  can't see the future, and both will imo leave a mark on this league but if i had to make a prediction my money is on doncic"
"No. Luka Doncic spent a total of 14:22 mins on Kawhi, over 7 games, the third highest on Mavs the last playoffs.  He allowed him to shoot 54.5%. Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith spent more time than Luka on Kawhi. Maxi for 38:26, while allowing 63.2% and Dorian guarding him for 29:48, and allowed 68%.   The year before that, Luka spent 9:17 mins guarding him,  4th highest on the Mavs. He allowed 62%, but for only 8 shots. DFS spent 28:12 on him, and allowed 41.4%. Maxi spent 27:07 and allowed 50%, but on a significantly higher number of 56 shots, the most shots he attempted against, besides Jerami Grant.  For Nuggets, Jerami Grant spent the most time defending him, with 56:13, the most by any player. He also allowed 43.9%, attempting 57 shots.  Jokic guarded him for 8:55, allowing 53%, on 26 shots.  Murray guarded him for 8:55, allowing 56% on 16 shots.   So your point about Luka guarding Kawhi for ""good amount of mins"" isn't even true. And it seems that it was Grant who did the most of the guarding on Kawhi, and doing a good job. Grant would probably be the second best player on Mavs. This has nothing to do with Jokic, it's just that Nuggets had a better team."

One more tech and we have the complete Luka Doncic starter pack lol  But in all seriousness I'm a little bit sad cuz he didn't get his 50-50-50. One last extra 3pt attempt ruined everything.
Even last year roster was complete garbage and Doncic dragged us to 5th seed. I seriously thought the roster was g league material without Luka.
Motherfuckers on Reddit talking about Luka Doncic not a top 10 player in the league don’t know shit  🙄
"More likely its just how it's counted/being a lil lazy, looking up luka doncic on bbref and it says the Hawks drafted him"
Doncic has now reclaimed his crown as top Luka
For a second I thought this said Luka Doncic
"I know, but that's the point of my comment.  It's not like the Atlanta Hawks wanted Luka, drafted him, and then were suddenly and completely out of nowhere, so blown over by the Mavs trade offer that they decided to make that trade.  The Hawks ""technically"" drafted Luka, but they very much did so at the direction of the Dallas Mavericks in anticipation of the trade.  So does it make sense to say ""Yeah, the Dallas Mavericks played 0 role in the drafting of Luka Doncic, and he should very much not be considered 'homegrown talent'"", or would that be fucking stupid?  Well, the same is true for THT - it isn't like the Magic identified him, said ""fuck yeah, this is our guy"" and then just couldn't turn down the Lakers offer of a 2nd round pick and cash considerations.  The Magic drafted THT at the Lakers instructions, so to be like ""'the drafting of THT' and 'the Los Angeles Lakers' are two things that never once interacted, are completely separate from each other, and had 0 interactions"" is dumb."
I think they were just too aggressive in trying to field an explosive scoring style offense. Gave up too much defensively for more offensive firepower. The analytics probably weighed heavy into their personnel decision making. Can’t blame them when you have a talent like Luka that can facilitate for an entire offense though.   The Seth Curry-to-Josh Richardson was really the only clear debacle that the Mavs have made.  THJ is and has been exactly the player that people love and hate. When he catches fire he can win a game by himself but for the most part he’s an inefficient chucker that doesn’t do much without the green light. Porzingis on paper was supposed to be a great fit. Shot blocking big that can stretch the floor…but his overall health and inability to consistently create offense for himself made him a bit of a risky acquisition. Powell was looking like a very good player until he blew out his knee and Kleber + DFS are exactly the glue guys you need on a roster.  The Mavs can beat anyone in the league when Doncic + THJ are super efficient  in their FG%/TO. They have enough offense to outscore even the best of teams. In a 7 game playoff series? Unlikely you can maintain that type of reliability offensively to make up for the lack of defensive prowess.

Clearly better than Luka Doncic
"I didn't like the hire but Jason Kidd is not the reason we have looked bad against good teams. His in game rotations have been fine. And except for the 1st game against atlanta, the game plan has been fine. The problem has been the starting unit and players shooting way below their 3 point percentage compared to last year. Doncic has started the season slow. Finney-Smith has been horrible shooting so far this season. Powell should not be a starter on any team hoping to be a playoff team and until 2 of the last 3 games KP has struggled with his shot. Also we have no good big men depth. Powell is not good, Willie just looks lost, Boban is a situational player, Moses Brown is too raw and Maxi is hurt. The only guys that has not struggled with his shooting is Jalen Brunson and Maxi before getting hurt.  I guess the one complaint I would have about Kidd so far is keeping Powell as the starter, but even then removing him from the starting lineup is not going to fix the other starters' struggles. Like I said I didn't like the hire but he hasn't given me much to complain about. The struggles we have had have been shooting wise. Things would be fine offensively if Luka was himself and players  that usually hit their 3 point shots were hitting them."
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
"I like Donovan Mitchell over Luka for starting backcourt right now.  Luka has great numbers but his efficiency is poor.  I know he basically has to do everything himself, but I think he's actually struggled so far.  I don't see a good case for him over Mitchell right now other than reputation.  That being said, it's so early in the season still...   Edit:  or maybe Chris Paul.  I would have them both over struggling Doncic at this point."
"As a Celtics fan, NO. It took them a while to mesh but now things seem to be clicking and we were a Luka Doncic buzzer-beater away from being 3 wins in a row. Sucks that JB is out for 1-2 weeks"
what's impressive is how luka doncic abused the crap out of the fouls and now hes carrying that garbage team to a 7-3 record
"Bruh are you for real? Having Luka mf Doncic over Marvin Bagley would do more for this team than almost anything else, especially solid coaching and good role players."
&gt; Doncic  Luka definitely isn't above Dame. He's in Dame's tier.
"Who wins a pre-30 vs post-30 game in the NBA?   **Pre:** Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Post:** Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Nikola Vucevic."
"I agree, though I think he'll be better than Bagley just because he actually tries. I feel like the optimistic outlook for Wiseman is a DeAndre Ayton comp, while the optimistic outlook for Lamelo is Luka Doncic. Ayton is great, but give me Luka. And it's more likely Lamelo reaches 90% of Luka's level of production, in my opinion, than that Wiseman reaches 90% of Ayton's production."
"nah, This sub LOVES Jokic. I honestly never seen him do anything wrong, even a tiny quote or a small article about him and his hobbies gets greatly upvoted and talked about. This sub LOOOOVES Jokic....a lot more than his contemporaries. Probably the only player that this sub loves more than Jokic is Luka Doncic"
"Damn, now everyone hates the heat now? This feels like when Clippers were against Doncic and how much the Clippers got hate. People on this thread love to defend Jokic by hating on the Heat. Its a death sentence on this sub if, god forbids, any player/team fights/ trash talks with Luka or Jokic"
"Oh I see. I'll try to get some of the main stuff for you; so long comment incoming ;)  Well, a lot of stuff happened since then. Luka Doncic (rookie in 2019 with the mavs) is now a top 5/6 player in the league; Kawhi keeps getting hurt and since the 2020 finals, LeBron and AD have been injured a lot (especially AD, but he was always injury prone anyways).  Two kids, Zion Williamson (Pelicans) and Ja Morant (Memphis) have already turned into all star caliber players (#1 and #2 pick of 2020 draft respectively). Zion is having some health issues due to his enormous weight at his 6'6 height tho.  The bucks were last season's champs, but battled hard on their way, especially against the Nets (KD, an injured Harden, and an injured Kyrie). That series happened in the 2nd round and was by far the biggest showdown of the year. KD proved to the whole world he was still arguably the best player in the world by recovering from his achilles injury. Giannis on the other hand man ! He was on a tear, especially in the finals. Great series as well. I'd recomment watching it.  On the other hand, the sixers, who performed very well in the regular season last year, still have a Ben Simmons problem. Some all time drama happened in the offseason following their elimination by the hawks in the 2nd round. Ben doesn't want to suit up, and now is faking mental health issues to not play with the sixers until they trade him.  Kyrie is a big antivaxx guy now, and he won't play a game until he gets his shot. He is so crazy right now he might even retire just to ""stand up"" for his cause.  Westbrook is now the all time leader in triple doubles. He went from OKC to Hou to Washington to LAL in 3 years.   That's a little bit of what happened these last couple of years. If you have any question, I'm here for you mate !"
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

Magic was the best player in the NBA at that time.   Let's take Luka Doncic for example. Possible MVP and likely to be the best player in the NBA in a few years. Magic was the same size but with better passing and more athleticism and explosiveness. Only thing he didn't have was the 3 point shot.
"Fuck Morris. Intentionally injured Luka Doncic in the playoffs and tried to do the same shit to Jokic out of spite on a finished game.  Next time he will not turn his back after shoving Jokic, if he dares to shove him again."
"It's just too hard to consistently lock down anybody in this era of basketball. You very rarely guard anybody 1 on 1 consistently without screens being involved. Even if you are successful, the offensive player can target a weaker defensive player by calling for a switch. Luka Doncic decimated the Clippers despite having two all defensive team candidates by calling for switches on Beverley, Jackson, Zubac and Morris."

"I took the car in to get tires rotated, oil change etc. the dude at counter looked exactly like Luka Doncic, earrings and all. Except like, if Luka went to a rich snotty private boarding school."
"Mario Hezonja was a gamble because he hadn't shown shit when he was drafted. Two seasons before he was drafted he played mostly garbage minutes, and his last season in Europe he averaged 16 minutes a game. That's very different from being League and Euroleague champion and MVP, being All-Euroleague first team, all-league first team, etc. Luka Doncic was the best player outside of the NBA and it wasn't even close, Hezonja was a gamble that hadn't shown anything yet.  You can't compare them at all."

"&gt;Perhaps the most glaring case: Dirk Nowitzki averaged 21.2 points per game across his career without Luka Doncic. But after Luka joined the team in 2018, his scoring numbers dropped to 7.3 points per game.  LMAO"
"In regard to asset management, at this point, it was a bit of a miss by The Warriors. They could have traded that pick for immediate help or traded back in the draft and accrued other assets. In saying that, I don’t think it’s anywhere close to the Kings passing on Luka for a variety of reasons:  1. GSW window is right now. They have a proven championship core and they were trying to round out their roster with a cost controlled asset in a position of need.  2. LaMelo isn’t on the same planet as Luka Doncic who will be a perennial MVP candidate and is widely recognized as a generational talent.  3. Wiseman could still be a reliable and solid NBA center. Too early yet to make any conclusions on his game."
"Best Starting 5:  Luka Doncic Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid Nikola Jokic"
"I would probably pick Ja too but this notion that you can just teach what SGA does is wrong.   It’s like saying you can just learn what Harden or Luka do to be elite drivers. Intangibles like body awareness, stop and go, iso IQ aren’t guaranteed to develop at extremely high levels.   Plenty of athletic stars who finish extremely well. But I’m not sure if there is a point guard in this league that finishes as well as Doncic (maybe Dearron? Probably needs more sample size)"
He can be had for the low low price of one Luka Doncic.

"As good as Luka is with the ball, he would do much better playing with a point guard.  Luka is a great post player and having someone that can actually throw and entry pass is nice.  If Kidd ever starts Porzingis at Center Brunson, Doncic, THJ, DFS, Porzingis is a great offensive lineup.  You can safely post up Luka and run the offense through his posts.  Also Brunson off of cuts is pretty good. Point is Brunson should’ve always started mainly because he’s an actual point guard in defense and none of the Mavs other players are good at guarding point guards outside of him."
In order for me  1. Luka Doncic 2. Nikola Jokic 3. Joel Embiid 4. Jayson Tatum 5. KAT
But Marvin Bagley has potential! He could turn out to be a star. He could even turn out to be Luka Doncic! We'll take the Marvin Bagley.
"i agree. i just think if i need a 40 point triple double or something crazy luka can provide that easier than jokic. hes also been better in the playoffs than jokic even if jokic is a good playoff performer, doncic has been amazing."

Has Luka Doncic ever shot league average or above from three?
"In my opinion, Mobley was the number one pick. He was putting up numbers similar to AD. Cade is more Khris Middleton than Luka Doncic in my opinion.   Jalen Green is good but he doesn't have the playmaking to be the number one offensive star. None of the draft picks do but Mobley can definitely be the number one defensive star for a team."
A Luka Doncic draft blessing coming your way.
"i really think you're in for a rude awakening if you don't think luka's progression started earlier than lebron's because he was already playing professionally lol  of course doncic being good enough to play professionally for years is a testmanet to how good he was. but surely you dont think lebron wasn't good enough to play professionally for years?  the answer is pretty logical:  a common problem with scouting uber athletic young players is that they're often playing against far less athletic competition. but they'll be playing against equal athletes in the nba (a big shift from what they saw in HS and college) and we dont really know if they will be able to keep up at that point. thus, young american superathletes have bust potential for that reason  on the other hand, luka was playing against grown men who were literally stronger and some more athletic than him for years. it forced him to get better (similar to young kareem) and not rely on his own athleticism.  lebron never faced that struggle until his rookie season in the nba when he was 19  it's a massive difference and if you can't see that you're just intentionally being delusional lol"
yes but have you considered luka doncic?
Do you guys ever get tired of making these comments? Are you really trying to say Luka Doncic isn't massively favoured on this sub?

"You've absolutely been taught right, but it gets a little more complicated.   When a shot goes up, you always expect a rebound to be available and you have a very short amount of time to look around where everybody on the court is. Sometimes teams make an exception for one player to follow the ball with the eyes to call wide, short, left or right, but usually a player cannot tell where a rebound will come down before it hit the rim and maybe the backboard, so you can take up to a second (for 3s) to look around and then back to the rim.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEQLQLBE3dc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEQLQLBE3dc)   You now have to know/sense where most of the opposing players are. If you have little chance to get the rebound you do what the coach told you (staying in position, boxing out a player who already moves to crash, get in half court offense position or run for a fast break). If you are in the vicinity of where the ball will come down usually 3 things are important.   a) How many players are close as well?  b) Am I the best nearby rebounder of my team?  c) Do I have body contact and where?  The answers to those questions give multiple scenarios. E.g.   a) Nobody. b) and c) don't matter, it's mine :D   a) 4, me and my center, two opposing big men. b) No, my center is. c) Yes, the my hands are on the opposing center's back. Very bad situation, you immediatly try to dash infront of the opposing player, but at least next to him and you push him with your behind and arms just to hinder him at least a bit. Under almost no circumstance do you try to grab the rebound yourself, it's just not gonna happen and a waste of time, plus you're in the air and probably foul over the back or you have no time to contest, because the 2nd jump will be to late.  a) 2, me and a similar sized player. b) Yes. c) I feel his elbow with mine, with me being in inside position. Ball comes down inside position you put your behind between your opponent and the ball and grab the ball with 2 hands. Usually no need to jump, if the opposing player tries it, it's almost always a foul. Ball is above both of you, you usually jump to tip it with one hand and your other arm works the opponent. Ball comes down outside postion, you usually get between the opposing player and the basket to try to discourage or contest any shot attempt.  Many more possibilities.  An examples in this game for Doncic is Def#2 [https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=45&amp;GameID=0022000071&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Doncic%20REBOUND%20(Off:0%20Def:1)&amp;sct=plot](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=45&amp;GameID=0022000071&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Doncic%20REBOUND%20(Off:0%20Def:1)&amp;sct=plot)  Doncic realises the shot goes up and makes a shoulder check for the baseline that he needs to defend.   a) 5 players, Doncic himself, his center Powell, his wing player THJ and opposing Butler and Bam. b) Yes. c) No. There is almost no danger at all of losing that rebound.   Doncic checked the baseline, that only he can protect, Bam is out of position and would compromise the defense in going for an unlikely rebound and Butler could only attack the rebound where Powell has complete control. Good defensive position by Powell and Doncic made no mistake. Had he taken 2 steps backwards to box out Butler, the ball would have hit the floor. Not a big problem here, because Powell boxes out Bam and THJ or even Richardson could have taken it, but it is only the second best solution, because you want Doncic to have the ball in his hands anyway.  Doncic's 3pt selection was imo mostly good, but that is a lot personal philosophy for me. Miami has Bam close to the basket, so I want to see some 3s instead of Luka running into Bam, when he is in good position.

"&gt; Net rating doesn't tell you much about a player individually.  Yes it does, all impact metrics are based on net rating. You only have to be careful comparing it across teams but within a team, it's the best non-processed stat we have on impact. Danny Green consistently has one of the best net ratings on every team he's played on, just look at it starting from the Spurs. His defense and spacing are constantly underrated. I'm pretty sure he scored higher than AD and virtually anyone else during the regular season except LeBron.   &gt; The year before that the entire GSW starting lineup was in the top 6.  We have on/ off metrics, the net rating I'm talking about only shows on numbers but that's highly correlated anyways. Anytime Curry was off, the impact metrics showed Curry was the driving figure in these high net rating lineups. In 2019 that was very obvious when Curry came #1 in net rating and his teammates didn't even come close.   &gt; ESPN even noted that Curry dropped to 8 I think this year because of availability last season.   I'm not talking last season specifically, even though the takes after last season are absurd too.    This was a take in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpaty9VujYk. And somehow KD coming off an Achilles tear was predicted to be guaranteed top 5 while Curry gets taken over by guys like Luka Doncic and Trae Young as a top 5 player. That's absurd."
Yeah. These were the odds   Luka Doncic +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo +425 Stephen Curry +500 LeBron James +700 Anthony Davis +700 James Harden +800 Kawhi Leonard +900 Kevin Durant +1000
Luka Doncic is a good player and has potential but he's not on the same level of good as all the players Johnson had listed above. Give him another 5 years and he might get there (that's kinda what happened with Giannis after being selected back in 2013)
"Warriors absolutely keep Steph for the history.  Warriors fans riot if someone puts together a multi-team trade where we get LeBron, KD and Luka Doncic, because Steph earned our loyalty.  The only reason Steph doesn't retire a Warrior is if *he doesn't want to*.  We stayed loyal to the team through over thirty years of sucking but trading Steph might just be the line."
"The only VR that’s worth it for me includes Riley Reid, not Luka Doncic"
"lmao you must have not watched any Luka games. On ball defense (except against tiny waterbugs like Dame and Kyrie) is his strong point on defense, he's plenty big enough and plenty fast enough to keep up with wings, which is his actual position on defense.  Trae Young will always suffer on defense because of his subpar size and strength and lack of explosiveness. He's not particularly quick, just crafty. That's fine on offense where he takes long range shots and is good at drawing fouls away from the basket, but his physical tools are just way too limited to ever have success defending even his own position, let alone anyone bigger. Doncic is at a defensive disadvantage against players much smaller or much bigger than him, which is basically true for every NBA player barring a handful of exceptional defenders. Trae Young is a liability against everyone on the court. Don't get me wrong, he can try and compete, but he's just genetically limited."

"""Multiple advanced stats"" = box score based formulas.  BPM, VORP, RAPTOR, RPM, WS, PIPM etc are all box score based stats with different formulas. Some are rate based, some also incorporate plus/minus, and some place more value in certain stats over others but they generally look at similar things. If a player is good with one they are likely good with another and people think ""oh they are good with all of them so they must likely be good"" They mostly overrate the same type of player whether they suck up all the uncontested rebounds or high a USG% and they underrate the same type of player who doesn't get a bunch of scores that show up in the box score. This is especially the case for defense. For example Russel Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and Hasan Whitesite get overrated by most of them them and it underrates people like Dennis Rodman, and Klay Thompson. Seriously look up Dennis Rodmans defensive player of the year ""advanced stats"" years for defense.  I like simpler advanced stats like TS%, plus minus etc but to look at them in context. For example ""oh this player has really high TS, but he is a center that just dunks and doesn't have high volume"" or ""this guy has high amount of rebounds but they are mostly uncontested and he barely improves his teams rebounding when he is on the court vs off""."
This may be a bit callous but who cares about Fox when you have Luka Doncic?
Luka Doncic
"He is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic  In football terms Spida is like a flashy wide receiver. Gobert is the entire offensive and defensive line.   Remove gobert and we are the 2017-2018 Suns, (Mitchell being our Booker), 15 more losses a season and never cracking the playoffs"

"A lot of people who were low on him didn't seem to appreciate HOW good he was in Euroleague.  Most Euroleague prospects are either young and raw players who get picked for promising skillsets and athletic tools - e.g. Dragan Bender put up 2.1 ppg in 11 mpg for a sub-bar Maccabi Tel Aviv team before being picked #4. Or else they are more established players without much upside when get picked as win-now prospects, like Bogdan Bogdonavac who was drafted at 25.  Meanwhile Luka was the youngest ever Euroleague MVP during his 18 year old season en route to leading Real to a Euroleague title. He also led Slovenia - not exactly a traditional basketball powerhouse - to the Eurobasket title alongside Goran Dragic.  On top of his pedigree, there was no shortage of film of Doncic playing against legit NBA talents. In the Eurobasket tournament alone, he matched up against Porzingis' Latvia team, the French team with Boris Diaw and Evan Fournier and the Spanish team with both Gasol brothers, both Hernanogomez brothers, Ricky Rubio and Sergio Rodriguez.  That's a much more impressive track record than the level of talent that say, DeAndre Ayton, Marvin Bagley, or Trae Young played against in the NCAA, and that's not even considering the fact that Doncic was playing against grown men while the NCAA prospects were playing against other kids their age. For comparison, Ayton's Wildcats got blown tf out by a Buffalo Bulls team with no future NBA players in the first round of the NCAA tournament."

Luka “Kyle” Doncic. Monster energy sponsorship incoming.
Because he is not a superstar. You have to be a legit threat to be a superstar. Luka is essentially just a thorn in the side of legit playoff-contenders.  Also OP clearly is a Luka hater. Several posts in the last two days shitting on Doncic.
Best TS% off drives so far (min 15 TSA):  Dame Lillard - 72.3  De'Aaron Fox - 72.2  Luka Doncic - 69.3  Bradley Beal - 69.3  Kyle Lowry - 67.6  Kawhi Leonard - 67.2  Worst:  Ben Simmons - 32.2  Marcus Smart - 34.4  Russell Westbrook - 35.1  LaMelo Ball - 38.3  Donovan Mitchell - 40.0
"I feel like this article is kind of ignoring the decrease in 3 point shooting that Doncic has as well.   Last year, Doncic played beside tones of above average 3 point shooters, and it was a huge reason for how Doncic got the spacing in the restricted area, as well a reason why the Mavericks offence was so great.   This year, the Mavericks decided to sacrifice some of the offensive fire power to help their defence. So Luka is going to be playing with less spacing, as a result his % in the restricted area should drop.   Now anything being extrapolated from a 4-5 game sample size is clearly too early to tell, however I just found that this article almost makes it seem like the only reason why Doncic is having a slow start is weight and not the other factors (including Powell coming back from a major injury, KP not playing yet, roster changes, etc.)"

Luka Doncic  Mvp season last year to bench season this year
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
&gt;Dallas Mavericks- Luka Doncic- if he can win a championship or two and multiple MVPs than I think he can overtake Dirk  If Jalen Brunson doesn't beat him to it!
Luka Doncic is arguably on pace to be the greatest player ever. Don’t disrespect him by comparing him to a rookie having a good season for a rookie
"We're not talking level, just style and skill set:  Luka Doncic = LeBron James + James Harden"
Luka Doncic is mvp
"I am not dissagreing, just for me Luka is still very young so there isn't a big sample size, he will probably be better first option than Davis but I don't want to judge yet. From the group Jokic seems llike the best bet because he is a hell of an offensive player but I think it can be argued that the Nuggets roster is a little bit better suited around Jokic than the one Davis had in NOLA. Then we get to Dame and Embiid who I would say have had better rosters but nothing much to show for it. All I am trying to say is if any of Doncic, Embiid and Dame can be called a superstar than Davis is one too."
Michael Jordan = Julius Erving + Walter Davis  Oscar Robertson = Paul Pierce + Deron Williams  Luka Doncic = Penny Hardaway + Joe Johnson
"Book/Doncic would be a great pair. I also feel like Luka works on most teams.   The only person he could step on the toes of is a Haliburton/Ja maybe, because he's going to take their touches at running point, but other than that, he's just setting guys up for great looks."
"I just wanted to stop by and say hello to the Hawks fans who like to talk shit about Dallas and Doncic  Two days ago I was being told Luka is fat, he's overrated, and Dallas won't make the playoffs because we suck. Now the Hawks aren't even in the top 9 in the conference where a .500 record has a team sitting in 5th place while Dallas has won four straight putting themselves back in playoff contention in the loaded Western Conference.   Not sure if you guys noticed but Luka went for 46 points, 12 assists, and 8 rebounds last night. Now don't get me wrong I'm actually a big fan of Trae I just wanted to rub some salt in the wounds of the subset of Hox fans who shit on Dallas. Apologies to those of you that are chill and don't hate."

Honestly some people prolly have him over people like embid and jokic and maybe doncic, but yeah luka is top 10 for sure."

And they still believe they won the trade because of this year's pick. Good luck betting against luka fucking doncic missing the playoffs.

"I yesterday watched ""Luka Doncic before and after draft"" video on yt. So called analysts were horribly wrong obviously. But, one of main reason of hating I see is that he is not American. Which is Stupid."

"Collins has an inch or so on Doncic, and Luka is strong. So it’s a toss up. Collins is more athletic, Luka has a knack for ripping down boards, as evidenced by the 4th quarter last game. But that’s not really how we judge rebounding. Lol."
I thought Luka Doncic was Mexican after that game in Mexico City
"The Dallas Mavericks had huge expectations going into this season and have been underperforming badly due to getting hit by Covid - 6 players were out at one point, and our 2nd star, Kristaps Porzingis, missed a bunch of early games due to recovering from a torn meniscus in last year's playoffs. We're #11 in the West right now, but we've won 4 of the last 5, so it's looking up.  We're also blessed by having an absolutely monstrous young talent in Luka Doncic, who is just 21, and is already a top 10 player in the league."
Luka Doncic without handles is Julius Randle without the centrifugal force.

Mikal Bridges for Luka Doncic.
Luka Doncic is Serbian  lmao gottem *dab*
"&gt; easily all-NBA third team  I'm not saying he won't make it, but between the likes of Steph Curry, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Luka Doncic, Damian Lilliard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, and Devin Booker there's *a lot* of competition (and no doubt there will still be names that others will be throwing out there). Definitely wouldn't call him *easily* 3rd team."
I think the over done hype for Doncic going into the season was to get $ into a losing bet early and then segway into the LBJ MVP for insiders to get paid out on the seemingly unexpected.  Before the season it was Doncic's year and LBJ wasn't going to play as much with their new acquisitions.  Now it's we were too soon on Luka and LBJ is carrying without AD and everyone else needs to finish strong to beat him despite an all time season by Jokic and carry job by Embiid.

"Yall want to bet the farm on players on the wrong side of 30  Kyrie is about Steph’s age when he started winning with Golden State. Dude lacks motivation but you hang a massive incentive-laden contract in front of him and he will dominate the league. Giannis would be second, LeBron or KD third  Next tier would be Joker, AD, and Harden. I could see a team in a big market like the Knicks or Lakers paying Zion for the marketing but it’d be a bad investment basketball-wise. Luka Doncic might be on this tier as well"
not when you go through the actual voting and remember its a narrative and reputation award   og had the same amount of votes as luka doncic at 2. gasol didnt have a single vote  those were the top 2 defenders on the #2 defense in the league
They also passed on Luka Doncic and Fox lol
"&gt;his rookie year was so strong. you could see that he has a control about him that comes natural. It’s another thing that people are forgetting about the bubble: he was injured and didn’t play. He’s honestly been so important for the mavs because he’s the only other floor general they have. He gives luka someone he can trust to help him run the offense.   &gt;   &gt;This year he’s taken even another step. His midrange has been insane (never mind his threes) and he gets so many finishes at the rim that look like they have no chance. I love Trey Burke and think he’s been great - for what he’s been asked to do - this season, but JB’s combination of pure point guard plus defense plus shooting is crucial for the team and deserves his minutes over Burke. He’s only a bench player in name; for all intents and purposes, he’s their #1 PG.  I think best case scenario, Doncic can play a Lebron-type role. A ball-dominant forward who can co-exist with a true PG. They ask so much of him I legitimately wonder if he's going to be worn down by the end of a full season."

I’m impressed by Luka Doncic solely based on how cute he is
"Mavs have just played the 2nd game only with the full roster. So, maybe the expectation is that they will improve and climb up in the standings which while Portland might fall down in the standings with Collum and Nurk out for some time. Not sure though how Doncic is at all in this discussion as Dallas really sucks right now. The lack of playmaking when Luka sits is breathtaking."

As for help  Warriors without Curry: -0.4   Blazers without Dame: -9.6  Mavericks without Luka: -9.0   Yet this whole sub would tell you Curry is carrying a bunch of Gleague scrubs and Luka's team is completely failing him.

"His ""big man"" numbers are certainly lower than they used to be, but guys with lots of assists also have lots of turnovers, ya know, so his turnover numbers are actually good.  Draymond's in the top 40 in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.8) well ahead of the likes of Luka Doncic and Ben Simmons, for example. In fact, the only guy who's averaging at least as many assists as Draymond that also has a better A:TO ratio is Chris Paul."
"Honestly if I was compiling a tier list of great defender it goes like this:   Elite: luka doncic, trae young, Alex Len, Rudy gobert, and AD  Good: jimmy butler, jokic, KP, Bradley Beal.  Bad: LeBron, dort, isiah Thomas, lamelo balls, London balls, and Kyle Korber.   Just my opinion tho."
here come the contrarian takes for the sake of being contrarian. Anyone with eyeballs can tell cade's playmaking is legit. People want to complain that he's not magic johnson or luka doncic in college when there's virtually no one else in college his size doing what he's doing.

If it had been called out of bounds it would be warriors ball with the greatest three point shooter in the world and top 10 nba player having a massively hot night would have a chance at getting the lead. That’s how close this game was."
James “Luka “James Harden” Doncic” Harden
Dirk played with AC Green and Luka Doncic
"Ah yes, the luka doncic special"
Hmm gives me Ayton/Bagley Luka Doncic situation vibes
"Luka Doncic was better than Zion this year, last year."
"They are crazy close tho, Luka isn't way better just because you decided to say he leads a lot of advanced stats, which you're not wrong about however I said they're close which is also true, he barely leads him in advanced stats, Doncic is better obviously but he also has a lot more experience so we'll probably see the gap close as the years go on but you clowns act like it's comparing LeBron and Reggie Jackson"
Same thing while he was at Real Madrid. A first team player was asked who the best player on the team was and he responded that the best player on the team wasn’t even on the team. That it was Luka Doncic on the younger team
"Everyone who watches basketball knows who Kuzma is. He has more social media followers than Trae Young, Ja Morant, Shai, etc, etc. and a similar amount to Zion and Luka Doncic."
"Yea do it!  Luka ""it's easier to score in the NBA"" Doncic"
"You'd have to be an idiot not to take LBJ or Doncic first. LBJ as the actual best player, Luka because of his age."
"Lol why are you limiting historic to the past three seasons??   This year Lamelo has been:  1.	⁠The youngest player to record a triple double. 2.	⁠The youngest player to make 7 threes in a game. 3.	⁠One of three rookies to make 7 threes and dish 10 assists in a game 4.	⁠Only rookie in the last 60 years to lead all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals heading into the all-star break. 5.	⁠One of three NBA players age 20 or younger to have multiple 20/10/5 games (the other two being Lebron James and Luka Doncic). 6.	⁠One of three rookies to record 7 threes and 10 assists in a game (the other two being Steph Curry and Jason Kid). 7.	⁠One of two rookies to average 15/5/5 and 2 threes (the other rookie being Luka Doncic). 8.	⁠Per 36, one of two rookies to post 18/6/6 for a season (the other being a Oscar Robertson; less impressive if he doesn’t play again this year).  That is literally the definition of historic my guy lmfao.   [This article does a pretty good job putting his season into perspective](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fansided.com/2021/03/03/nylon-calculus-comparing-lamelo-ball-greatest-nba-rookies-ever/amp/)  I know u want your guy to win but saying Lamelo wasn’t having a historic season? Come on now lol"
"My favorite player is LeBron, and I've liked him ever since he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine like 20 years ago. But I would advise you not to be a LeBron stan.  Here's some young and exciting players that I love to watch:   \- **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City** \- Crafty young point guard with an all-around skillset   \- **Lamelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets** \- Great passer and playmaker, and still super young   **- Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies -** Explosive athlete, a point guard who plays above the rim   **- Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings -** Smooth, reliable guard who plays like a veteran  Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Zion Williamson, and Trae Young are all really good and young, but they already get lots of fanfare."

U do realize tv ratings are down for all televised events because of core cutting with the only exception being the super bowl? Leagues are run through social media and only soccers players generate a bigger following then NBA players. Luka Doncic has more ig followers than Mahomes.  Most people in my age demographic 18-25 are likely to watch and play basketball in North America then any other sport because of ease of access.  Basketball I would argue is more popular than ever in the youth demographic and I’m from Canada btw which makes it even crazier.
Original poster made clear Luka doncic was not to be mentioned in this. They are about traded on draft day so he's not looking for that sort of answer
Just 3 separate Oscar Robertson and Luka Doncic: Kareem - AC Green - Dirk
Luka Doncic
Could the Mavs sweep the Clippers though? You know because of LUKA DONCIC!
Six years is a long time in basketball years. Six years is the difference between Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic
"Just saw my first live Luka Doncic ""And-1""  It gave me goosebumps. It was surreal. I have dreamt of this moment for the past 2 years watching highlights on youtube. I was jealous of everyone who had heard it live before. But now i am part of that group. Let me tell you it feels good. To any other new NBA fan who is striving to hear those words live. You will get there. Just stay focused. Your moment will come.  Thank you Luka."
Getting embarrassed by Luka Doncic.
"[ESPN] Tim Hardaway Jr. on Luka Doncic: ""He's taking stupid shots."""
"marv: that was uhh michael jordan hitting the 3 from a pass from luka doncic and the celtics go up by 2      grant hill: that's right marv"
"Reddit is full of dumb fuckers who overrate rookies then throw a third-grade level tantrum when they aren’t always good. Ant got it first, then Wiseman, now it’s Melo’s turn. These guys are too young to fully evaluate, can we take a breather? I mean, shit, LaMelo Ball probably has a middle ground between G-League Jason Williams and Luka Doncic with flair."
"Full list of everyone who qualifies for these filters (i.e. everyone who has made more than 50 pull-up threes since the ASB):  Steph Curry - 93/229 (40.6%)  Damian Lillard - 95/245 (38.8%)  Anthony Edwards - 55/142 (38.7%)  Buddy Hield - 53/139 (38.1%)  Jayson Tatum - 65/178 (36.5%)  Luka Doncic - 90/262 (34.4%)  CJ McCollum - 59/175 (33.7%)  Lowering the threshold to 40 adds Jrue Holiday (43/103, 41.7%), Joe Ingles (47/119, 39.5%), Donovan Mitchell (50/129, 38.8%), Zach LaVine (48/137, 35.0%), Kemba Walker (42/126, 33.3%), and Jordan Clarkson (49/175, 28.0%)."
NARRATOR: ...and Luka [Doncic] got comfortable.
"&gt; No, he had siakam on him too and overall Raptors limited Giannis using zone defense and so preventing him to attack the rim. You just can't try the same with Luka  After game 2 was vast majority of time Kawhi  Nobody said it’s the same thing where we getting this these are obviously very different players   &gt;  so you need someone ready to spend a lot of energies doing that.  I don’t buy this idea guarding Giannis is somehow physically less taxing than Doncic. Defending superstars is a 5 man team effort. The idea I initially responded to that no coach would put their star on the opponents best player just isn’t in line with reality. Happens every postseason. Jimmy Butler was guarding Tatum and LeBron last year. We can debate the approach of how to guard Doncic whom should do it and how much Kawhi should guard him. But people have overcorrected on the idea of “can’t have top defenders guard top players because it’s too taxing on their offense”"
"&gt;it should be either Luka Doncic   True, someone putting up worse counting stats, worse advanced stats, on a team with a worse record definitely deserves it over Jokic"
"&gt;just that it doesn't matter too much.   I dont really think he's particularly unique in this sense relative to other stars. If you want to make a macro level point about how on ball doesnt matter that much that's fine. But I actually do think who's defending Doncic on ball matters more than it would with a number of other stars. Not that it's vitally important but alot of it comes down to how you can respond to him initiating contact. If you start getting moved or pushed its over. One thing Ill note is Kawhi in particular has always quietly gotten alot of respect from the officials, and that includes defense with the level of contact he is allowed to get away with.   &gt;So fighting through the screen isn't the same for him as Luka doesn't need the space that other ball handlers want  Yeah but he still wants to manipulate defenders and capitalize on specific things they do. For as many fouls as Doncic draws he also has tons of plays he tries to initiate contact and foul bait and doesnt get the call that's where the positioning and balance of the defender matters. The closer you stay onto him at the hip on the pick and roll the harder the floater gets for him, and honestly alot of fouls he draws are when the defender is initially is beat.   &gt;Also there's just the fact, that a lot of pick and rolls - you basically have to switch, because if you don't it's wide open lane to the paint or a wide open step-into 3  Depends entirely on the defenders in the play. When its KP in the pick and roll they are more likely to switch. But Dallas also doesnt have many good screeners beyond Powell which is why low resistance switching should be avoided  &gt;But starting the game and guarding Luka for most possessions is a different conversation.  Im more just against Morris defending him who I just think is pretty flawed. If I had to control it I would switch off between Batum/PG/Kawhi for the duty with having a quicker trigger to letting Kawhi defend him for stretches than I would in other matchups."
I feel bad that Sacramento fans don't get to watch Luka Doncic play for their team. Vlade decided that Marvin Bagley was the better choice. I really do hope that the rumors about Divac not liking Luka's father being a key factor in not drafting him are not true.
I don’t disagree but I’d still much rather have Paul George guarding Luka Doncic than Marcus Morris or someone like Patrick beverley(not that Bev will this series of course)
News flash Luka Doncic is quite good at basketball games
Put Kawhi Leonard on him from the first game instead of dicking around and putting Marcus Morris on him for long stretches like he’s done in the past. Don’t have to put Kawhi on him every play of the series and obviously there’s Paul George but at some point if you really believe this just put your best defender on him to start to set the tone early. Kawhi’s offense isn’t going to fall apart because you put him on Luka Doncic for a game to start the series.   Regardless of whether you put PG or Kawhi on him put your best options on him. So much of Patrick Beverley and Marcus Morris vs Doncic last year
"sure but you know we're also living in the time of LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, quite possibly Luka Doncic and Chris Paul and we also saw Kobe Bryant.  Fuck if Steph weren't around Klay Thompson would be getting discussed as the GOAT shooter."
"As you can see the downvotes are the only way they can come after you. Just suppress the voice and a legit argument.  Clippers players actively used racist words against Luka. And this organized racist behavior only stopped after its brought up to the media. If the roles were reversed, Luka would never ever see basketball court again. But since it was Harrell it was ok. And then they try to not use racist words but go with other slurs. It wasnt enough for them though.  They tried to injure blatantly. It was one of the worst look for any playoff game in recent history. The last time this type of obvious try to injure play happened between rondo-wade.  The worst part is those racist slurs and malicious plays to injure Doncic did not stopped by the coaches, teammates. Systemically its accepted by the refs, coaches and players. You only see half ass apology or very small fine after media brought this up. Otherwise its pretty much ok to do this on Nba court"
Yea Clippers players did everything they can included racist slurs towards to Doncic and trying to injure him. And its still somehow the Morris become a victim of racism... F’in BS  Racism is not a one way street. Its actually more common with uneducated people and low socio-economical level. So Morris-Harrell acting racist is not impossible. After all Luka is not just “white” but also a foreigner so he can potentially catch all types of xenophobia from all races in US.
"Kawhi was the same MVP level player he’s been for a while now in that series but Luka stole two games single handedly. Stats aren’t going to tell the whole story, even there Luka isn’t losing by much. But especially with KP missing Luka was the Mavs entire offense and it worked. Mavs had no business making that series competitive but Luka went above and beyond.  (Admittedly might be as big a Doncic fan as a Raptors fan)"
"Yeah, the guy that won the Raptors a Championship on one leg and has 2x Finals MVPs, has more to prove in the Playoffs than Luka Doncic. Definitely.  You people are nuts..."
"Luka Doncic is a pure scorer, the dude averaged 29 a game in his sophomore season. I mean, people consider Lou Williams to be a pure scorer, and Luka is miles above Lou."
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1.

"for real, so frustrating seeing all the luka stans in all these threads, if it's doncic it should be by a hair once you actually look beyond counting stats, and that's fine if you think he should win it, but all the people discounting dame.."
&gt; any stat that has deandre ayton and clint capela over luka doncic can't have much merit behind it  Like rebounds per game and FG%?

Luka Doncic sends his regards
&gt;But they just never had that chance  Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic.
"I don't know how to describe it for people who didn't watch him, or didn't watch european basketball at the time...  He was so much more than ""a pretty good stretch 4"". Imagine a skinnier Luka Doncic. By the age of 21, he was 3x European Champion and 3x Final Four MVP. He was AMAZING.  When he came over, he (along with the 5 other Euro greats at the time, Petrovic, Divac, Sabonis, Radja, Marculionis) faced a lot of shit. A LOT. Tex Winter told this man, the best playmaker in Europe, to ""not dribble the ball"" - they wanted him to throw on weight and muscle to be a PF.  He did. He became a stretch 4. But he could've been so much more. And he settled for winning chips behind Jordan and Pippen instead of being a perennial all-star somewhere else. Think Pippen once said Kukoc was comfortably a top-20 player at the time, but his numbers suffered because he was the 3rd option.  Oh, and Toni was clutch as fuck too."
Imagine a Dirk or KD type scorer with Jokić level vision for a big man and he preceded them all. Only Luka Doncic matched some of his insane European exploits. Crucial peace in the 2nd three-peat for the Bulls. Well deserved HOF introduction.

*There’s no GOAT but Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Doncic is the messenger of Dirk Nowitzki*
Luka Doncic
"Luka doncic, I could tell from his first season it would be this way"
"Throwing nice passes is different from being able to dominate while running an offense, though.  Like lets say Green in his prime averages 30/5/5 .. how does that make him a dominant playmaker? James Harden, Luka Doncic score 30+ while also averaging 9-10 assists and controlling the entire offense - thats the difference between a bonafide superstar and the type of player you're describing ..who'd be a very good max player but not an MVP you can build a title team around.  I've watched his Ignite games as well and I'm curious to know where you are seeing something different from myself and most others. [This scouting report sums it up well](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/3/9/22320551/jalen-green-nba-draft-ignite-g-league).. he isn't an unwilling passer but his playmaking skills aren't categorized as elite or anything:  &gt;Green is not much of a playmaker, averaging 2.8 assists per game on 2.7 turnovers. He mostly hunts for his own shot when he’s on the floor. The times when he does pass often seem predetermined.  ...  &gt;The problem for the NBA team that drafts Green is that he is nowhere near ready to run an offense, and a player with his limited passing chops has to play off the ball. That will be a challenging adjustment given that he’s always been a ball-dominant guard."
Luka made a pass fake. A lot of that type of stuff in this video that really makes defenders wonder what he’s going to do because he’s so deceptive:  How Luka Doncic Manipulates Defenses - 7 Of His Most Deceptive Plays https://youtu.be/2CQ0N96SgCA
1. Steph Curry ......... 47.2%   2. Zach LaVine ........ 36.9   3. Jamal Murray .......36.9   4. James Harden ..... 36.8   5. Dame Lillard .........36.0   6. Luka Doncic ......... 35.7   7. Jayson Tatum ....... 34.6   8. Jordan Clarkson ... 33.3
"Luka ""REGGIE MILLER"" Doncic."
"You're talking about ethnicity homie. Race is skin color. Ethnicity is your culture, food, language, location. Luka Doncic is a white slovenian."
"It wasn't shocking if you knew that:  * McDonough knew his job was on the line and this would incentivize him to take the ""safest"" pick * Doncic was risky because the local Phoenix media ran an smear campaign against him that was pretty ugly. It caused a frenzy among the Suns fans who were fed up with the front-office and were led to believe that McDonough was going to draft the next big bust when they wanted him fired * Ayton was the local kid and incredibly popular in Arizona * ESPN &amp; Co. were joining in on the Ayton as the no-brainer #1 pick which brought the pressure onto the national stage.  None of these things matter if you have a capable GM with job security. Which is why Donnie Nelson was also the one who aggressively traded up for Luka."
"LeBron James is the biggest magician of them all, he tricked everyone into believing that Ty Lue is a good coach, the same Ty Lue that six games into his career without LeBron was 0-6 and got fired AND was the assistant coach of the Clippers choke last year. Like seriously? You are switching Luka freaking Doncic into Ivica Zubac in the playoffs? Has this coaching staff watched a quarter of Luka playing all season?   Last night Luka hit ONE shot with Kawhi actually defending him, every other shot after the first quarter was on either Morris, Zubac and Pat Bev or with Kawhi going under a screen. PG13 also only took him consistently in the first quarter.  You have two of the best perimeter defenders in the game and you are going under screens and allowing him to switch with ease, that's a fireable offense. Can you stop him completely? Fuck no, but you can atleast try to slow him down."
"Kawhi would be the better fit with the current lineup , easily. Defends better, shoots at a lower volume than Luka but on great efficiency (so Luka can still score at volume without hampering his rhythm), can act as a secondary/tertiary playmaker because of his improved passing (we've seen what happens when he is the primary playmaker). Great pairing with Doncic."
"If that player were Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons, Giannis or Bam Adebayo I'd give them a chance, if it has to be someone else from their roster that's gonna be a no from me, dawg.  Also the Celtics need a 6th player on offense, preferably Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic or Damian Lillard"
"Well, the fact that you aren't a historian is why. Being ""white"" is really amorphous. Irish were not considered white. Balkan people were not considered white. Italians were not considered white. Over time, all these things changed and they are now seen as ""white"", indicating strongly that being white is not a cut-and-dry biological feature, but is actually significantly influenced by geography and politics. ""Whiteness"" always existed, see: ""white man's burden"", but not as the same concept we know today.  Slovenia, where Doncic is from, was slated for ethnic cleansing bu the Nazis in the second world war. Evidently they did not meet the requirement of being aryan enough to not get murdered, so some historical nuance is required. So yes, it is fair to say Slovenians do not have the same historical experiences of being ""white"" as a guy from Indiana, despite Luka Doncic being considered white in the present day. That is the nuance here"
"They are both ball hogs, for the best of reasons.   It appears to me Hardin chances of a good shot or pass goes down more the longer he dribbles, no one in NBA history is more deadly in the first 1-4 seconds he is near the top of the key.  I don’t think Doncic chances are any higher with getting the ball off quick vs taking his time and waiting until  someone bodies him up. (much like a younger LeBron, he invites a defender to go with him to the basket. Lebron has much more hops so he slams it home, and Luka does whatever, both shoot incredibly high percentages in close and not elite,  but still really good from outside."
"I am saying that luka doncic is a white person. this is not a controversial opinion to me, I genuinely can't believe it's even being debated lol  idk what jews have to do with that statement at all.   &gt; If you can’t understand what I’m saying, I can’t help you.  this is correct. you've taken a weird racial tack in this discussion that I don't understand and I suspect might be nonsense/gibberish"

"""Busted"" was an embellishment to really drive the point home here on just how much value the Mavs are getting from paying Luka fucking Doncic $8M. Having someone like him on a rookie deal is bonkers and the fact they have him means they're set basically for the next 5+ years, just gotta build around him."
Luka “Ed Wuncler III” Doncic
"Luka Doncic absolutely embarrassing the two most toxic players in the league is just so fucking life affirming. Not a really a Mavs fan, but god damn I cannot get enough schadenfreude from the Flippers demise. What a horse shit organization lmfao"
"We don't get Hali if we had Doncic on the team. We'd have a great chance to make the playoffs in 2018 and the core of Fox Hield Doncic would've been enough to make a run from then on.   Now were banking on Bagley to make a splash and join Fox and Hali as our core. Hield hit his ceiling, doesnt fit our timeline, and causes too much drama on the team. With Luka though, hield would been like a more efficient THJ of the current Mavs."
"Now that I think of it, I don't think I've ever seen a Kings flair around here. Of course, I avoided the post-game threads of the sweep/fuck Luka Doncic and Vlade Divac tour"
"If we get past Utah, watch [Villain Brooks clamp Luka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2Chzryg6Pw) in front of the whole world.  &gt; holding Luka Doncic to just 12 points (25% shooting, 4-16 FG%)"
"&gt; Has Vivek been questioned on how it feels to miss out on Luka Doncic? Has anyone engaged Vlade to see if he has buyers remorse, or is he still a believer in Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic?       Vivek wanted Luka, and Vlade no longer works for the Kings. Did you just get out of a Thai prison?"
"Honestly, none of those top 5 picks are bad except for Bagley lmao  Luka and Trae are obviously the ""best"" players, but JJJ and Ayton both offer that extra defensive versatility that so many teams like Portland/Boston/Clippers are always missing. Probably could argue that Trae should definitely have gone ahead of JJJ and Doncic should definitely have gone ahead of Ayton, but Grizz ended up with Ja and Suns signed CP3, so it worked out for them in a way."

It says he apologized during this season..  Anyways, it seems like Luka is over it. For the record I want you guys to win I just think the frothing hatred is a little misplaced this time around.  Except for Pat Bev. Fuck Pat Bev."
Yes I'm sure Luka Doncic would not have wanted to win this series if not for the Clippers' trash talk last season.
"""TOO FUCKING SMALL""  - Luka Doncic in the bed"
pat bev going to be out of the league soon courtesy of luka doncic
"[""Since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976, only four teams have won a series after losing the first two games at home: the 1993 Suns \(over the Lakers\), the 1994 Rockets \(over the Suns\), the 2005 Mavericks \(against the Rockets\) and the 2017 Celtics \(over the Bulls\).""  ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/clippers-mavericks-los-angeles-facing-overwhelming-odds-as-luka-doncic-dallas-take-2-0-series-lead/)"
"This is all on defensive scheming and coaching. You can't let a team shoot basically 60% in a playoff game.   The Mavs were getting wide open shots any time they wanted. Yes some of it is due to Luka being incredible, but there were so many late and missed rotations it was way too easy for them. The Mavs aren't making great plays/difficult reads there is always a wide open man one pass away.  Zubac is not the answer, in the first quarter alone he let Kleber score 12 points and got burned by doncic on a couple 3s. You can't have him in and allow that switch to Doncic that's too easy. I don't know if Serge is hurt, but if he can't play go small and put Mann in or something.   It's inexcusable the lack of defensive scheming and execution. It's allowing the Mavs to get whatever they want whenever they want it. Getting swept is a guarantee unless they make serious defensive changes."
"Modern players are lazy. Traditionally you would only switch if you have like-sized defenders and like-skilled defenders. In the modern game that evolved to everyone on the court is about tht same size so just switching everything, also IF  you have a deadly shooter than can shoot quick and from deep. Ie You have to switch everything with Steph and dame.   Now? These dudes are switching regardless of the defender or the offensive player. They switched Pat Beverly onto Luka Doncic as if they had no choice Luka is not a quick shooter. Luka doesn’t do anything fast. You have time to reject that screen, get over , or even go under. Luka isn’t gonna kill you if you go under. There were even times where Luka Ja a few feet from the 3pt line and they’re still switching.   It’s looking more and more like they just don’t want the smoke and they die on the pick as a cop out"
"in 5th grade you aren't getting picked by a 250 lb man and the guy bringing you to the pick isn't Luka Doncic man. He's stronger than his defender and makes it impossible to go over the screen, and if you go under he'll shoot a stepback 3 (something you don't have to worry about in high school either)"
im sure chasing 8th graders around a screen and luka fucking doncic surrounded with 4 nba caliber shooters are the exact same thing
"Not anymore - that's the one area Luka improved the most this season.     &gt; If you’ve been following Doncic’s season, [it’s no surprise how improved  he is in the midrange](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/5/26/22454327/luka-doncic-turned-the-tables-against-the-clippers-ivica-zubac-powering-the-mavericks-to-a-2-0-lead). After taking just 51 midrange shots last season,    he took 183 of them this season, making 89 of them (48.6 percent)."
"Yeah, Denzel Washington is practically just a light-skinned Luka Doncic."
Luka Doncic
"&gt;He did that dramatic exit only to lose to fucking Luka Doncic in round 1, patheic  Acting like Doncic isn't a top 5 player"
Kobe's dead and this dude named Luka Doncic is better than LeBron

Their defense is fine. It's just that next to Luka fucking Doncic their defense looks terrible. There is nothing they can do but watch the rest of the series.

"Mavs are running like a well oiled machine. They’re getting really good minutes out of role players like finney-smith, Brunson, Kleber... even  Cauley-Stein was huge for them tonight.   Clips role players aren’t so good. They can’t even figure out who they want in the floor... Ibaka and Maxey haven’t seen much playing time instead they’ve gone for an unhealthy diet of Morris (who’s getting absolutely torched by Doncic), Batum and Rondo  Luka, Kawai and PG are playing pretty much as you’d expect. Kawai was an absolute beast in game 2 and if he hadn’t played at that level Clips would have lost by 20"
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
Luka Doncic goes birrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd
"\-BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,👀👀  \- Pat Bev...I had NO PROBLEM with Pat Bev...I had no problem with Patrick Beverley -  Luka Doncic"
Luka Doncic
"Well, I mostly agree. But I don't think it's evidence that Kawhi played worse. Kawhi's not a point guard, Luka is. He did a worse job at doing point guard things (passing, playmaking, running sets), but that's not fair/common ground. He's a small forward/wing. Yes he's not a true PG - but he's not even playing PG! Rondo/Bev/Jackson are playing point. That's like saying ""yeah, Luka had great passing, but he wasn't so great getting contested points in the paint and rim protecting cause he's not a true C."" Can't hold another player's job against anyone.  Kawhi is supposed to be a good defender, which does not show up in box score aside from occasional steals. By-and-large, he was still a better defender than Luka this game.  I won't say for a moment that scoring 2 extra points means he had a better game. So you have to compare what they're expected to do at their roles: did Kawhi play better defense than Doncic playmade? Honestly, who the fuck knows. Not an easy comparison to make. Only certainty is they both played great and this game cannot be used as an example of Luka being entirely ""better""; they did different things.   But I will say, as an aside, that no one stumbles into 7 turnovers out of bad luck. No matter how little you think it was his fault, they have to be held against him. If he turns it over out of a trap, that's a turnover. If his teammate can't get a hand on it, that's a bad pass turnover. Such is life as a point guard"
Luka Doncic is basically Bargnani with better passing.
"Luka gets the switch at his will. Kawhi might start defending but that doesn't mean he can stay on Doncic for 24 secs. In some of the p&amp;r, Spanish p&amp;r sets, you either switch or double Doncic. Doncic is just too good of a passer to be doubled and Mavs getting easy looks, many open 3s when Clips try that."
"Bro we Mavs fans have been so confident before even going into this series, this is a pleasant surprise but not too crazy. I personally called Mavs in 4 before the series started. Because I know how good our team is; far better than our record. Covid cost us a ton, and KP's off season knee surgery too...   BUT I DIGRESS  Everyone in the whole league shits on us. Always have. Doesn't matter what po-dunk backwater team they support, every yokel you come across in the wild has something to say about the Mavs. We have a chip on our shoulder due to that. But the Clippers literally have so few fans that we just don't meet too many of 'em so we don't have that much animosity towards the Clips.   Plus, let's be honest, it is literally sad at this point, we Mavs fans take no joy from kicking them when they're down. We'll leave that to others... we are just vibing so hard, not because we won this game, but because Luka Doncic is a Dallas Mav."
Luka Doncic *Sr.
Luka Doncic
Can somebody please explain to me why Trae is considered an elite 3pt shooter while Luka is considered below average?  2020-2021 stats:  Luka Doncic: 35% on 8.3 attempts per game  Trae Young: 34.3% on 6.3 attempts per game
That’ll happen when teams shoot as well as the mavs have. Clippers are more talented but mavs are obviously way better in the coaching department.   One thing that’s becoming clear to me is that Luka doncic is the best player in this series and we have to start talking about him as an arguable top 5 player.   Defense is great on the wing and all but scoring and playmaking are and always will be the two most valuable traits in basketball. Kawhi is a slightly better scorer but Luka is more dynamic and the playmaking isn’t even a discussion. It’s why I’ve always felt kawhi was a little overrated and thought the best player in the world talk was insane.
Luka Doncic and Tim Hardaway jr are the real new MJ and Pippen that’s how
"Their defense is very, very bad and their offense isn't that great either. Extremely reliant on jumpshots and Paul George is not good enough to be a 2nd option. Predictable offense and terrible defense = not a good team.   Mavericks are simply better. Luka Doncic is the best player in the series."
"They have rim protection, they're just switching him onto Luka Doncic at will for some reason."
"Luka ""Messi"" Doncic"
Ah yes. 6’1 Patrick Beverly not being able to guard 6’7 MVP candidate Luka Doncic is definitive proof that he tricked us all and actually sucks at defense!  Draymond must be way overrated too because he can’t stop Embiid.
it's just a poorly constructed roster.  Kawhi and PG are essentially the exact same player and are also the two max players. Like this type of thing works in the regular season and against lesser playoff teams but when your two stars predicate themselves on wing defense and are getting continually owned by Luka Doncic you aren't winning shit.

"Their defense was mindbogglingly oblivious to what was happening to it. Time and time again they switched onto Luka whether it was with Beverly or Zubac and Doncic ate them up one-on-one. When they doubled, Doncic made the correct read and there was a wide open Mavericks player getting an easy bucket."

1. James Harden  2. Steph Curry  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard
Because Luka Doncic is a human cheat code and for some reason Ty Lue has just decided to stop playing Kennard who is 41% from 3 points this season
"&gt; Does anyone think the Nets would become worse if Doncic replaced Kyrie, even considering he could be a worse fit?  I actually think they  might be worse because Luka and Harden are very redundant in what they do(Harden is currently better) and Luka is a much worse shooter than Kyrie is, so Kyrie can function better off-ball."
Harden &gt; Doncic  Harden &gt; Lillard   &amp; dare I say Harden &gt; Curry.   edit: Also Luka is better than Dame.
"The path to the shot he wanted to take was obstructed by Luka and evidently, Mann can't do double clutch lay ups, at least at that speed. Not saying Doncic played perfect defense but it somehow ended up being better than Mann's offense."
"I love the Mavs, and I definitely think a win against the Clippers would put us in a great position as a serious contender. BUT it’s highly important not to understate just how good the Jazz have been pretty much all year. Plus, you seeing this Phoenix team? They’re on a tear, and have a much greater starting five than Dallas (assuming CP is back soon)  I’m optimistic about the Mavs’ chances, but let’s be honest; this was an ugly ugly win, and in the two games before that anyone not named “Luka Doncic”  just couldn’t shoot. Luka is a once-in-a-generation talent, and from what I saw of the rest of the team this season I’m pretty sure the last three games were outliers, but the Mavs are by no means the favorites (even if both LA teams are out)"
Luka „played against grown men at the age of 7“ Doncic
Trae Young vs Luka Doncic @ NBA FINALS
nah dude won't do that. in Europe loyalty is big when it comes to sports so I doubt we will see anything else other than Doncic as a Maverick. also we saw Cuban is willing to do everything for his star so I really doubt Luka wants out at any time (given KP doesn't get an max extension)
"Luka ""Jennifer Aniston please text me"" Doncic"
"I mean, not really. The Lakers won a championship last year, and have 17 total. They’re currently playing with one half of their 2 stars. And they’re playing a legit squad with both young talent and veteran leadership.   The Clippers still haven’t won shit, they have a full and healthy unit by and large, and they’re playing against Luka Doncic, while most of the Mavs are just their to watch like the rest of us."
Scoring or assisting on 31/37 field goals by Luka Doncic is the record
Get in da mind of a Luka Doncic
"They played:  Michael Jordan: 179  Luka Doncic: 11  Allen Iverson: 71  Kevin Durant: 144  Jerry West: 153  LeBron James: 265  Anthony Davis: 38  Donovon Mitchell: 27  Rick Barry: 74  Elgin Baylor: 134    In other words, 11 games is nothing. One bad game will drop him out of top 10. It's a lot harder to maintain the high scoring than just have a hot start...LBJ's average is insane with more than 3 FULL seasons (in number of games) of playoff games"
Honestly fuck the kp haters. He hit a couple huge 3s. Played good ass defense all game minus one bad ball fake from morris. Everyone will point to that and not the 3 from reggie fucking jackson the play before on a late closeout by doncic. Luka is amazing but at times he makes us a black hole on offense and slows the tempo so much. If you just looked at the box score you would think this game was dominated by luka but in the 2nd half he was not good really. Also kawhi must really want an early vacation.

Mavs can't even get a pass from Luka at this point.  Wow Mavs stinky only Doncic shows off.
I think the Mavs somehow have a higher offensive rating with Doncic off the floor but I don't think he calls many plays with Doncic playing. He just let's Luka take command.
Grant hill said “I don’t think doncic has scored yet” in the third then he dropped 13 points. Just said the same thing here right before luka hit a mid range so I’m expecting another run from him

The Clippers should just have someone on the court with a gun pointed at Doncic but not ever use it. For defense of course.  Then the Mavs can counter that by forming a ring around Luka.  Or Morris can make out with Luka on the floor.  Really anything to throw him off.

"New Chris Paul Commercial Plot Hole.   The new Chris Paul commercial has him playing HORSE with the Luka Doncic of the WNBA, Sabrina Ionescu. It then breaks the fourth wall when lightskin Jake aka Devin Booker if he was 5’10 says that they didn’t read the script. Chris Paul then reads the script and it says, as a plot twist CP turns into a Basketball. CP3 then vanishes. The problem is, he was already holding a basketball, and another basketball did not appear. Therefore, CP3 did not actually turn into a Basketball. Where the fuck did Chris go? What is State Farm trying to tell us? Was CP3 already part of the basketball? I need answers."
Is Trae Young going to win a playoff series tonight before Luka Doncic?
I require Luka Doncic to make less than 30 points today.  Please.
"Yeah if it is once or twice yeah it certainly wouldn’t be dozens. It would interesting to retroactively keep track of that from the past games. IMO it’s prolly more like 5-6 times a game but either could be right.   But even in “swing points” it could more likely be dozens.  Say they’re down 1 and Lebron thinks he was fouled on a layup. So they could have been up one. But then on the other end it’s a 3. Now they down 4. , that’s a 5 point swing just off one miss. And then say Lebron isn’t participating the next possession cuz he still complaining to the ref and then Wesley Matthews thinks it’s his duty to miss a shot, and then the other team runs back another 3. Now they down 7.   Point is in this hypothetical Lebron actually may miss three alternate possessions at least, focusing on one missed call.  I may be romanticizing but I never seen Jordan do that. Or Kobe. And when they did get caught up whining chances are next possession they are shooting free throws cuz they gonna draw a foul for sure.  Just odd to see a dude on mt Rushmore whine like he’s luka doncic or something"
Yeah and I don’t think what the Atlanta gm has been that impressive either. Suck for a few years and you get good players. Trading away luka doncic was a historically bad trade even if luka is a perennial all nba player. Doubt marks does that trade considering how much euro scouting he has. Gallo contract will look really bad in a year but those moves he made this season will make you guys better for a year or two
"Skip's been preparing his transition to shit on Luka ""te baby GOAT"" Doncic for a while now."
"I think LeBron is washed in 1 definition of the word but also not washed in another definition. LeBron clearly isn’t as good as he used to be, that’s the one definition I believe he fits. But most people say it like he isn’t still a top 5 player in all of basketball. Washed LeBron is as good as James Harden, Luka Doncic, Kawhi, and maybe just slightly worse then Steph."
"so another form of ‘who are the true superstars in the league?’   That’s easy. In order:  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  I’d love to put Luka Doncic on there because I watch and really respect the Euroleague and how hard it is to win that ish. But no.  Any other name you’ll see or have seen mentioned here all have caveats, explanations, projections, ifs/ands ,wishes and whatever jargon they use to rationalize it.   Fact is, they are not certified."
Luka Doncic or James Harden. Long shot Steph Curry.

"When I think the best passing style I think the Warriors from a couple years back or the Spurs. The Warriors should be strong again next year and the Spurs should always play a good style as long as Pop is coaching. A couple of the top young exciting playmakers now are Luka Doncic from the Mavericks and Lamelo Ball from the Hornets. Jokic from Denver is an amazing passer, too. I'm biased as a fan but I think the Raptors will be back to playing an entertaining, hard nosed and unselfish style next year and really as long as Nick Nurse is coaching there.  I highly recommend you get NBA League Pass. You can stream every game plus they have highlights, stats, condensed games, different streams for each team's announcers, and other features. You could watch a few condensed games or highlight packages to get a feel for a team, and then dive into full games. Another feature is you can hide the scores if you don't want to have a game spoiled before you watch it. I swear I don't work for them lol just think it's a really good package, especially for someone who might have trouble watching games live."
I feel like Aaron Rodgers would maybe be Luka Doncic then.  Because he came in right after another franchise/league leader retired.
1. Kawhi Leonard 2. James Harden 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Luka Doncic 6. Kevin Durant 7. Trae Young 8. Joel Embiid 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo 10. Jayson Tatum 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Lebron James 13. Ja Morant 14. Mike Conley 15. Derrick Rose
"Okay.   1. Kawhi Leonard. Averaging 33 ppg on 10/21 from 3 and 2 double doubles so far  2. Luka Doncic. Averaging 33 even with only scoring 19 one game with a neck injury. Also has a triple double so far  3. Kevin Durant. Averaging 33 ppg on very efficient shooting  4. Joel Embiid. If you take out the game where he got injured and only played 11 mins, he's averaging 29 ppg with great defense  5. Jokic. 31 ppg, and 2 double doubles  6. Harden. 26 ppg and 11 assists per game so far  7. Trae Young. 27 ppg and 10 assists  8. Damian Lillard. Had one stinker where he only scored 10, but before that was averaging 37 ppg.   9. Lebron James. Not his best series, but still putting up 22 ppg and 8.5 assists  10. Giannis. In a sweep, put up 23 ppg and 15 rpg  Bonus. Both Devin Booker and Chris Paul. I didn't even mention Anthony Davis. Ayton is the fifth most impactful player in his own series"
"&gt; There has been a fair amount of press over the last few years suggesting Deandre Ayton's play has not been deserving of the Number 1 pick in a draft that includes stars such as Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Gilgeous-Alexander, and several others  Unsure why you needed to include this."
What? I just think kawhi isn't the same player he was in 2019 when he was a top 4 player in the world. Last year he got worse as the series went on. Luka and jokic are approaching their primes and playmaking engines. Kawhi is a better scorer and defender but most of the time this series kawhi hasn't even been guarding Doncic so what's the point of his defence. He's still an amazing scorer but these guys do so much more offensively and jokic thoroughly outplayed him last season
"I am not sure that all star fan votes is the main indicator of a NBA player’s fame. Giannis has only been getting attention since 2019 when he took his team to 1st seed in the East and to the Eastern conference finals. Kyrie has been famous for much long as he was the 2nd star that was part of the 2016 NBA champion, the Cleveland Cavaliers.  Luka Doncic had much more all star votes in 2021 than Steph Curry but I do not think Luka is more famous than Curry right now."
As a Hawks fan I am legally required to remind you that Luka Doncic was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks and then traded for Trae Young and the pick that became Cam Reddish.
LUKA DONCIC

"The only way Luka and Jokic play together is if one leaves through free agency, because neither Denver or Dallas would ever even come close to trading Jokic or Doncic.  There isn't an offer in the league that either team would take for those players."
Those are Luka Doncic numbers
"I dunno, ask Luka Doncic."
"That sucks. I’m a Clippers fan and I’m glad the Clips have evened out the series, but Luka Doncic is one of my top 5 favorite players currently in the NBA. The kid is special and he will be an all time great when his career comes to an end."
"""Everyone agrees Luka Doncic is a generational talent"" - very debatable. I think his hype is putting too much on him without proof."
"BREAKING: Mavericks Star Luka Doncic listed as Questionable for Game 5 with a bruised front cranium, sources tell ESPN."
"You forget that Kawhi in his third season was as good defensively as Luka is offensively now while already being a VERY efficient scorer (52/38/80). A majority of the spurs success was due to his defense he played against the best of the best game in and game out.      To think that from that point, Kawhi became one of the top 3 players in the entire league defensively AND offensively is just ridiculous. I see the potential of Doncic but he is limited defensively and always will be.      Luka just needs a bit more experience and he will eventually get his championship ring(s), there is no doubt. As of now, Kawhi Leonard is still the better player."
Dallas PD have arrested Luka Doncic and are charging him with assault and battery with a deadly weapon for the attack on Luka Doncic.
Show me where I acted proud about it. I’ll wait.   Imagine liking Luka Doncic and being proud of that though lololol. Couldn’t be me.
"&gt;Luka Doncic yelling at Pat Beverly ""you're too small"" Game 1 and 2; well, guess what? Last night Doncic was ""too small"", in fact, so small he was nowhere to be seen on the court in the 4th quarter, that's why I call him ""No Clutch"" Doncic"

did u add in Jevon Carter and leave out Luka Doncic and Trae Young?
"Luka ""2002-03 Bruce Bowen"" Doncic"
"That's recent though, Magic shot 90% twice in his career and was a 85% FT shooter, Big O was 6 ft 5 and shot 84% aswell.  If there's one criticism from Skip Bayless about Luka Doncic and LeBron James that is fair is their FT shooting, it's laughable that these guys are so good and one shoots 65-70% and the other is shooting 40% from the line against the Clippers.  I can guarantee to you that, if Luka was a 90% FT shooter, Skip wouldn't be as mad when Shannon calls him ""Baby Bird""."
"I figured the Clippers would win the series when the Mavs shot 70% from the field in the first half of game 2 and were down 2 points at half time. it's clear the Clippers are the better team, and the Mavs season shooting percentages suggest they're not gonna keep up that level of shooting. but I would not want to be facing someone like Luka Doncic in an elimination game that is close down the stretch."
"Maybe a few names who were Euroleague final 4 MVPs (or its predecessor equivalent) that should be familiar with the NBA crowd: Arvidas Sabonis, Dominique Wilkins, Toni Kukoc, Manu Ginobili, Luka Doncic. Yes, I think he will be OK."
Luka Kennard &gt; Luka Doncic
"People actually thought Luka ""40% from the line"" Doncic is better than Kawhi."
"Excuse me but if you're not Jayson Tatum or Luka Doncic by year 2, you're obviously a bust and should get ready to play in China.  /s"
"I know this is about KP, but the coach NEEDS to go.  Luka is a great and very dominant player, but he needs to be coached.  We can see it in the way he responds to the refs, he is prone to frustrated outbursts. He is used to getting his way, maybe a bit too much so. He needs to be coached.   The relationship he has with KP is a great example - a better coach would have figured this out already.  Another great example was the way the game ended last night. After Luka hit a step back three, the score was 114-107, with just over 2 minutes left. The Mavs make the Clippers work hard on the ensuing possession and Reggie Jackson takes a deep three late in the clock, and unfortunately for the Mavs, he makes it. 117-107, 1:40 left. The Mavs have two timeouts.  With the clock and score, you MUST get a good shot, and quickly, on your next possession, or you will lose the game. Given that you have 2 timeouts left, you must take one here. Carlisle doesn't take the timeout and Luka dribbles for 20 seconds, unsuccessfully trying to lose Kawhi, and winds up taking a contested midrange fadeaway that he bricks. Game fucking over.   Simply cannot have that in game 7. Completely unacceptable.  Need a coach who doesn't mind ruffling the feathers of the star, if that means his team will be in a better position to win.   If the Mavs don't figure this out, they will waste Luka Doncic."
"yeah this is an absolutely ludicrous trade idea without picks attached. we’re going to trade Grant, who absolutely loves being in Detroit, for a guy who hates playing next to Luka Doncic?!! absolutely zero potential upside to a trade like that... even if he works out, he isn’t anywhere near the trajectory of our young guys or our upcoming FRP. we’re in the middle of a rebuild!  that 50 people read this completely nonsense idea and thought, “hm, that makes sense!” Jesus..."
"Ok that might be true, but did you know that Luka Doncic needs a better costar than Kristaps Porzingis?"
"Luka doesn’t have people to give the ball to. I agree with this, but it’s not like Dallas is a championship team if only Doncic would pass more. When he would pass to an open shooter, they would miss."
"When the guy with the ball 90% of the game is Luka Doncic you learn to live with it. The offense has been absolutely stellar the past 2 seasons with Luka playing like this. Porzingis needs to understand that he needs to support Doncic, he’s the center of the whole thing. If Porzingis wants to be a bigger piece he has to be a better player, that’s just the hard fact. It’s hard for me to look at Dallas’s offensive numbers and think that those numbers improve by taking the ball out of Doncic’s hands and putting it into Porzingis’s."
"I don’t know much about basketball, I admit. I only started watching because I got hooked on Secret Base/SB Nation videos and the basketball ones were by far my favorite. Basketball is a fun sport to watch and follow.   The Mavs are the team I probably like the most right now. Luka’s great, he’s like the players I liked to watch most, I think. Just from my surface-level understanding of the game.   But watching game six, it seemed like more often than not whenever he’d bring the ball down court and tried to make a play whomever he kicked the ball out to was a dud instead of a stud. Hardaway Jr. had some highlights but it seemed like Luka just had nobody to rely on. Not their seven-foot three point shooter (?) who can’t rebound (!?) KP, not anyone else.   It seems to me like he really needs a go-hard baller who can actually handle themselves. The Clippers won because they had a balanced offense of Leonard, George, and Morris while if you look at game 7 for the Mavs it was Doncic then.. wait for it.. looking down the list.. KP, Finney-Smith, and Hardaway Jr. tossing bricks.   If just one of an opposing team’s ballers has a good day, the Mavs are fucked. The team lives and dies on Luka having a good day every day. He needs a second man who can handle himself."
"holy you are just another level of cringe man. Thank you for introducing me to a punctuation. I have never heard of the basketball player punctuation but I will be sure to look at his future games and stats. But I know Trae young is better than punctuation, poku, and luka doncic and thats all that matters"
Trae Young is Biolage Advanced Full Density above Luka Doncic
"AD’s new contract gets him about 40 million less than if he’d stayed with the Pels and signed the supermax.   If Luka took the QO he’d get 13.5M in 22/23. Then he could only sign for four years for 25% of the cap with 5% raises.   He’d be giving up about 70-80M over the five years after his rookie deal. He’d give up about half of what AD gave up in total just in the year he’s on the Qualifying Offer.   And he wouldn’t be able to sign the Designated Veteran Extension with his new team.   So by going down this road he’d be giving up 120M+ (but possibly much more if the new TV deal is significantly bigger than the current one) in earnings over his entire career.   So yes, Simmons and Russillo were being idiotic and didn’t know what they were talking about. They had no clue how much it’d cost Doncic."
"Idk man, Mitchell's pretty strong and he uses that strength in the paint. Clips struggled stopping doncic in the paint, so i expect Mitchell to drive in and get shots at the rim. If its not there hes got better players to kick out too then Luka."
"I don't have a dog in this fight - but Luka is already lightyears better than Porzingis has ever been - so damn right he's an afterthought to Doncic, as he should be."
When I turned on First Take and saw the headline that said “Is Luka Doncic the best player on the planet” I actually chuckled to myself.
Sure. Don't think you can count on winning a round but you should be in the post-season just by the fact you have 4 solid-or-above players around Luka Doncic.
KP hasn't had an offseason he wasnt rehabing or a complete season working/playing with Doncic. The Dingus coming out of a physical 7 game series healthy is the story. He will finally have some time to work on his body that isn't rehab related and get on the floor with Luka to start the season to bud some sort of chemistry.
"Porzingis has had plenty of bad games. That being said he has had games where he is scorching in the first half and the Mavs (mainly Luka, but not exclusively) froze him out completely.  Imo the next step in Luka's evolution is to learn when to take over and when to get your teammates going. A rare bad trait of what has otherwise been a spectacular season for Doncic."
The Mavericks outscored the Clippers by 7 points with Luka Doncic on the floor in this series.   They were outscored by 43 points in just 55 minutes without him.  I’m not even going back and forth if you don’t think Richardson and Kleber are barely guys that can get minutes. Clearly didn’t watch the series.
"you’re right, the jazz don’t have luka doncic"
"The Luka-KP pick and roll should be the most unstoppable play in basketball. However, Porzingis either has a poor understanding of how to properly operate it or is simply reluctant. He almost always screens and then fades to the top of the key beyond the arc. If he were more willing to roll hard or occupy the soft spot near the FT line when teams trap or hard show on Doncic (which they almost always do) he would look like a completely different player."
"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA’s golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him “a stud” and “built different.” They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka’s play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then… right? If you’re familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you’re reading this) then you might have an idea of what’s coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there’s lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a “flopper” a “chucker” a “bitch” and a “choker.” I even found two comments that said “I hate [Harden] as a person.” (It’s odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that’s a topic I’ve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what’s different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don’t seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that’s it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, “the Mavs didn’t have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.” r/NBA doesn’t have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players. The only example of a caucasian player being disliked in r/NBA that I could find in my research was Grayson Allen. People love players like Alex Caruso, and say he’s a top 20 shooting guard in the league, while his teammates who are also shooting guards are ignored or hated, like Avery Bradley and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope respectively. I would rank both of those players above Caruso in terms of talent and impact for the Lakers, but only one of those three players is given universal praise on r/NBA."
"Another article mentioned exactly that (highlight hunting) when detailing Carlisle and Luka’s relationship. Rick seems like he hates the flashy stuff and just wants to win, Doncic seems like he wants to have fun while winning. [Interesting read.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic)"
"NEWSFLASH if Luka Doncic is on your team, you are absolutely an afterthought"
"Yes but Doncic is Slovenian and I said that he played well.   &gt;Porzingis had an overall disappointing series as Luka Doncic's co-star. The Slovenian dominated all series, but the 7'3"" big man struggled all series, especially in grabbing rebounds.  Sorry if that was a bit unclear, but here I'm trying to say that Doncic dominated all series but Porzingis was poor"
Neither of Trae young or Luka Doncic are going to turn into Andrew wiggins lmao....
"&gt; Kristaps Porzingis reportedly feels like ""an afterthought"" in Dallas amid the rise of Luka Doncic.  &gt; Tim MacMahon of ESPN reported Porzingis has been ""frustrated"" at not being looked at as a true co-star to Doncic, who gets the lion's share of the praise and touches in Dallas. Mavericks governor Mark Cuban has previously admitted Doncic and Porzingis are not friends off the floor, comparing the situation to Dirk Nowitzki's relationship with Jason Terry when they first played together.  that's literally the whole article"
"Yes but it’s not that simple. Rivers only got the ball cause we got desperate   But the system was designed so the only people that got the ball, was someone who could dribble and taking advantage of a 1 on 1 matchup. If you can’t score in isolation on your man, you won’t get the ball unless it’s too shoot off the catch   So no cuts, no screen plays, no catch and drives, nothing unless you are one of the ball handlers   Though we usually had 3 of these guys on the team, and two of which were superstars so it worked fine, until someone stopped playing well (cp3 in 2019, Russ until he was playing injured.   Now Doncic is pretty much doing it alone. Some possessions Brunson gets and THJ is expected to hit all his catch and shoot shots or take advantage of the Luka double (not a bad person to do so). But this is definitely a one man army style of ball"
"He is to me at least. When I think of the Mavs, I think of Mark Cuban first, then Luka Doncic second. Then I don’t really think about them very much after that."
... and then he ripped off his mask to reseal Luka Doncic  ... who then ripped off his mask to reveal Larry Bird  Have you ever seen Larry and LeBron in the same room? It was the Legend along.
"I didn't follow the series stats that closely, and I'm floored that Luka Doncic shit basically 50% from the free throw line."
"&gt;As the centerpiece of a blockbuster trade, he anticipated forming one of the NBA's most potent duos with Luka Doncic, a fellow rising star. Porzingis anticipated it'd be a 1A-1B sort of situation.     &gt;Then there are questions about the chemistry between Doncic and Porzingis. The Mavs' franchise cornerstones admittedly aren't friends, a distant dynamic that team owner Mark Cuban has compared to the early stages of the partnership between Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry, which ultimately produced two NBA Finals appearances and a championship.     &gt;But Porzingis has been frustrated, often feeling more like an afterthought than a co-star as Doncic dominates the ball and the spotlight, sources told ESPN. Porzingis frequently made thinly veiled references during his postgame media availabilities, such as saying the ""ball actually moved tonight"" after high-scoring performances or stating that the offense didn't involve him on low-scoring nights.     &gt;A lack of on-court interaction between Doncic and Porzingis, who rarely high-five or communicate directly to each other, has become apparent. Asked directly about it on April 8 after a win over the Milwaukee Bucks, Porzingis made no attempt to downplay the awkwardness. ""Yeah, we're trying to play together and help each other,"" Porzingis said. ""We want to win. At the end, we all want to win here -- and that's it. We have to keep playing and keep playing together and keep playing well and help each other."""
The bigger problem imo was an injured Luka in games 3 &amp; 4.   From then its a BO3 series against the Clips which they would still be favored to win.  You're right it was still winable Doncic just didnt have any help and Morris for somehow became Steph for a night
&gt; in game 3 they had a massive lead on the Clips at one point  and an injured Luka Doncic for 2 games so u know
"Yeah but the trade isn't made with 20-20 hindsight. On paper he's a defensive minded ball-handler. He is exactly the type of player you wanted to experiment with next to '19-'20 Luka Doncic. He gives the team ~30 minutes where he can make up for some of Luka's underwhelming defense (Luka's jump this season defensively was pretty surprising) and also play a few minutes where Luka's on the bench to create some consistency across lineups during those few Lukaless minutes, which is even better when paired with Brunson who...did not take a jump defensively, to put it kindly.  The trade didn't work, but Seth wasn't a great fit for the perceived team needs and he had the most expendable skillset (low volume 3P scoring in limited minutes at a high clip on a team of the most efficient offense in NBA history) and most-tradable contract. Sort of like the Porzingis deal, I think it worked in theory and failed pretty miserably in practice."

Luka “Big Titty” Doncic
I initially mis-read your comment as just player they had drafted. It seems like a weird thing to criticize DAL over as they had just drafted those players before ATL did. Meaning they had been on rookie scale contracts but they just expired.   Luka Doncic  Josh Green  Tyrell Terry  Jalen Brunson  and then DFS is making 4 mil a year for the next 3 years or so
I wonder how many different form of post I'm gonna see about Luka doncic
"This might be a hot take and might just be because I'm looking at numbers and highlights at 5 in the morning but 2009 LeBron is very Luka Doncic stats-wise.   His pace was immaculate and all but, instead of scoring with footwork and fall-away Js like Luka, he's just getting past you and putting it through the rim. At the end of the day though, 2 points is 2 points and his numbers will look a little better than that.   09 Bron gets 33/8/8 on about the same splits but better free throw shooting, slightly worse three point shooting."
"It's not a stretch  Randle was the first option (didn't have Luka Doncic on his team for spacing lmao) and averaged more points, assists, rebounds on just 3 more minutes per game and was more efficient from three (Porzingis was more efficient FG wise, but he's a center and centers tend to do that.) He also played better defense.   ""Stretch big KP"" shot 29% from three and didn't play any defense  Randle was also miles better in the regular season and isn't on a max contract."
"In this third quarter especially, I wouldn’t say other players did nothing.   The guys with the most attempts on either team were Doncic and Morris. Doncic had 6 points on 3/8 from the field, 3 missed threes, and 2 missed fts. Morris had 11 on 4/7 from the field and 3/4 from 3.  The mavs had 23 points that quarter which meant other guys made 17. And they did it on 7/15 from the field and 3/6 from three. Meanwhile the clippers not including Morris had 19 of the teams’ 30 points and were less efficient going 6/19 from the field and 2/8 from 3 though they made all 5 free throws.  DFS, Boban, Porzingis, and Hardaway Jr were all shooting well that quarter. DFS had as many points as Luka on 5 less attempts."
"And if Dallas has ATL, roster he'd have more modest numbers, probably more assisting than points ratio compared to now, and he could make most of them in second half and decide games. Now he just gets exhausted.  I agree. Doncic has an advantage over Trae as he can help his team in more ways and could even get much better on defense. For Trae his height will always be a slight limitation when it comes to defending, going to the hole, or even making some passes in the half court which Luka has no issue with due to his size."
"&gt;Mavs are terrible with Luka off court  If you are going to start talking about plus/minus and off the court data, Luka Doncic has had pretty mediocre [on/off](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) data for three years in a row now. He doesn't have the on/off stats that virtually every superstar he gets compared to has and actually has the +/- data that is closer to a decent roleplayer. Whenever that gets brought up people always shoot it down but now that Luka is positive by literally 7 points in the sample size of 1 series, all of a sudden +/- gets brought up and used as proof."
"Didn’t watch the game today cause of the Beavers, but here’s his 6 game numbers in 4th https://ftw.usatoday.com/2021/06/luka-doncic-fourth-quarter-mavericks-clippers-struggles"
good guy luka doncic
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
"Every team above the Mavs had a more talented roster, the team around Doncic is pretty barren compared to the other contenders. I doubt there’s that many coaches that could take the Clippers to 7 with a roster of Luka and role players. Carlisle’s been widely respected as one of the best coaches in the NBA for a long time"
"Hear me out, hear me out.......Luka Doncic and Dame  Both players need help on their own teams. Together they would be the most fun duo in the league to watch"
"yeah it's kind of funny that Mavs clearly made the right move in getting Doncic - and Hawks made a big mistake letting him go. (sorry, Trae is awesome and super entertaining, but Luka is just better). BUT the Hawks have done everything else way, way better. They've put together a competent team around Trae and while the Mavs swung for the fences and struck out."
"He was easily the best Doncic defender, had him shooting airballs today.  Last I checked Luka was shooting in the 30% range against Kawhi for the series."
"Kawhi &amp; Luka easily, I've seen Kawhi take underwhelming talent against loaded KD teams &amp; either beat them or come close to it.  Kawhi next to a superstar like Doncic would be disgusting he'd average 40-50 a game on like 70% TS."
"Luka ""Despite the Loss"" Doncic"
TIER ONE  1. Kawhi Leonard  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. LeBron James  TIER TWO  5. James Harden  6. Luka Doncic  7. Giannis Atentokounmpo  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard
Tough that over that 10 minute stretch that Luka Doncic was outplayed by Luka Nard.
"Fuck Kawhi.   Have people forgotten how shitty Kawhi treated Pop and handled that situation? How Kawhi handled the situation after Pop’s wife passed away? What happened to all my fellow homies who also don’t like him?  Fuck Kawhi Leonard. He will never, ever be viewed in the same light as LeBron or Curry. Or even Luka Doncic.   Fuck Kawhi and fuck Paul George.   Man, I just feel so bad for Luka :("
To be fair i'd blame Doncic and Rick Carlisle more than the rest of the Mavs team. Games 6 and 7 clips just trapped Doncic at half court. And rather than Dynamically respond their only strategy was to pass away and expect the rest of the team to do everything while Luka just hovered at half court for the kick back out. The Clips figured it out and responded beautifully and the Mavs just kept doing it over and over again hoping their 3 point shooting would bail them out but it was infuriating to watch and infuriating to watch them shoot shots there was no hope for a rebound and watch just horrendous failure to box out like deer in headlights watching it slip through their fingers.
"What a disspointing finish for the Mavs. It was so infuriating to see the Mavs response to Kawhi and the Clippers lock down defense. The Clippers responded in a big way to games 1 and 2 by trapping Doncic at half court. And rather than respond all Luka knew how to do was pass away and hover at half court until the ball came back to him.   His one trick pony game came out in full force and showed he's not learned to be a dynamic player a la Kobe, Lebron, Jordan. All he knows how to do is drive and score. Better than perhaps anyone we've seen since Bird. But you have to learn what to do when teams lock that down.  The Mavs response was to shoot the ball and lower your chance of offensive rebounds because there response all year was to clear the key for Luka and stand outside and shoot. What they really needed was a dynamic offensive scheme to repond to the Clippers locking down on Luka but they were like deer in headlights.   That and the Mavs complete absentmindness to box out for rebounds was infuriating to watch.   I was really praying for a Mavs win so we could match them up in the Conferance Semifinals.   Now we've got to face the Clips just when it looks like Kawhi has settled into full claw force."
"&gt; 34, 4 and 10 and losing in 6 to Jokic better then 34, 8 and 10   They both had 34 points but Lillard had a ridiculous 66 TS% compared to Luka's 57%.   I don't value guard rebounding.  They both had 10 assists but Lillard had half the turnovers that Doncic did.    I get Clippers are a better team than the Nuggets and particular defensively but just how efficient Lillard got his points and how insane he was at passing without turning the ball over leads me to say Lillard was better.  &gt;The other 3 scored 5-6ppg less   I value efficiency more than volume so to me their performances were a lot closer. If Luka hit more than half his free throws and therefore was more efficient and did better in the 4th quarter's he would have been much better but he didn't."
"Yeah this is also the same guy that traded up to get **Luka fucking Doncic**, and told Cuban they wanted to draft Giannis.  Lmao it’s so easy to be dismissive of a F.O."
"Luka ""reverse Enes Kanter"" Doncic"
KD + Harden would get you like 2 championships in 3/4 years while Doncic could technically leave the Mavs after 4 years with 0 championships. I personally wouldn't want to take the risk about Luka staying and rather go for the safe option which would give you very very high chance to get 1 or multiple championships.
"&gt;downplaying the historical performance of Luka.  It wasn't a historical performance. Lillards performance was better. Booker's was comparable and better in some ways. Ja Morant and Mitchell were also really good. We live in an era where Dillon Brooks scores 25 ppg a playoff series.  &gt;Some Hawks fan are even saying that Trae proved that he is the better player by advancing to the secound round, which is laughable  Some? What is some? One or two? I see a lot more Mavs fans get super defensive that Trae Young and Ayton has progressed to the second round while Doncic hasn't.  &gt;Now let's talk about the the Mavs roster.  Speaking about rosters... Look at Lebron who you compared Luka too. He went to the ECF with a worse roster. He had a better regular season record despite being on a much worse team than Luka has these past two years. Lebron at the same age was on another level from Luka.  &gt;Taking all of this into account, it is undeniable that what Luka did this series is historical.  It isn't. Look at how efficient Lillard was. Look at his assist/to ratio. It wasn't even the best first round performance for a point guard this year. Last year so many Mav fans were talking shit about making the playoffs while Ayton and Trae weren't good enough too (despite the Mavs being better). Now the opposite has happened and Mavs fans are being super defensive."
"&gt;Harden hasnt had a series as good as this one by Luka  Harden averaged 35 ppg against the KD Warriors in 2019 who are arguably the best team of all time while outperforming KD, Steph, CP3 and Klay while also having better efficiency than Doncic did. What are you even talking about lmao"
&gt; The Mavericks outscored the Clippers by 7 points with Luka Doncic on the floor in this series.  Is that really an impressive amount? DFS outscored the Mavericks by 26 points and Dwight Powell by 10 points. On the flipside Reggie Jackson outscored the Mavs by 50 points. Damian Lillard was plus +27 in his losing performance.
"KD has like 67% TS this playoffs while Doncic has 55.6% TS, you are acting like they are close with scoring just because of the points per game but Luka is no where near as efficient."
"Luka couldn't hit free throws. True shooting is not the end all be all stat for efficiency, seeing how Doncic lit it up from the field but still has a poor true shooting percentage"
"Porzingis has got to go. They have do whatever it takes to trade him this summer.   I also can't believe they traded Curry for Richardson. I thought it was a bad trade when it happened, now it looks flat out egregious. Also taking Green over Saddiq Bey was a really poor decision. Doncic with shooters is nearly unstoppable.  I think Cuban needs to think hard about who's making their decisions going forward. If they keep fucking up, Luka might be gone after his next contract."
"You literally didn’t watch the games lmfao.   No the reason this went to 7 was Luka. 45 in game 5 or the series ends in 6.   Was game 5 not on the line?   He clamped Luka to an insane 35/11 on 40% from 3.   “Clamped”   No what won the series, as seen in game 7. One team had lots of talent. One team had Luka Doncic and some role players.   In order of points in game 7   1. Luka, 46  2. Kawhi, 28  3. Marcus Morris, 23   4. PG, 22  5. Dorian Finney-Smith, 18"
"Luka has 5 40-point playoff games. That’s more than:      Damian Lillard   Carmelo Anthony   Tracy McGrady   Kyrie Irving   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Vince Carter   Tim Duncan   Karl Malone         **Doncic has played only 13 career playoff games. The players above have played at least 50.**"
"Put a better team around Luka + Luka gets in better shape = Mavs title contenders next decade+  ---  The Mavericks outscored the Clippers by 7 points with Luka Doncic on the floor in this series.   They were outscored by 43 points in just 55 minutes without him.  ---  That being said, his heavy workload, he was not good in the 4th quarters of the series ... Ran outta gas .... He gotta look at other young stars like Vlad Jr get in better shape and reach the next level"
"Even if the secondary cast replicate that shooting(doubtful) they don't have a first option as dominant as Luka Doncic speerheading it. It's understated just how dominant the entire Mavs offense was in the first two games, I don't see the Jazz really being that."
Yeah but when the Mavs role players are going like that they're a better offensive team since they have Luka Doncic. I doubt the Jazz are going to be able to replicate what the Mavs did in those two first games.
"You can’t just say barring injuries though. That’s fine if you’re talking about Jokic or some normally healthy star. When you’re talking about a guy like Irving who has become unfamiliar with finishing the season and even a consistent guy like Harden who has dealt with a bad hamstring injury this year, you absolutely need to be factoring in the possibility of injury.   But even a healthy Nets team isn’t a damn 95% favorite over the Clippers. I think that’s just us not understanding percentages. People don’t really seem to get what 95% means. You also can’t just say “based on where they are right now” because by putting a team in the finals, you have to consider that the team is most likely playing well in the first place if they’ve made the finals.   As to why the Clippers couldn’t leave Kawhi, or George even, on Doncic all the time. Maybe you ended up getting your answer here already, but there’s a few things. It’s hard to get through so many screening actions, especially because guards can set illegal screens. If you try to get through a screen and not switch you have to surrender some level of advantage. But the Clippers could have done a better job of getting the guard out to “hit” Luka and then recover. That gives up a certain advantage to the screener as he’s open for a beat. But that’s probably the best way to do it. The other reason is that the Clippers have a lot of like sized players and they are willing to live with Morris or Batum on Doncic and obviously PG as well. It’s preferable to switch most of those matchups than to tire out a guy making him get through especially because there’s a fair chance he could be at a disadvantage in getting back to his man."
You literally just described Luka Doncic 🤣
"Just popping in to note that both DeAndre Ayton and Trae Young have made the second round before Luka Doncic. Pretty interesting, if you ask me!"
"Luka ""Despite the loss"" Doncic, played out of his mind. Trading KP will be addition by subtraction, so hopefully next season Dallas can go further. Really want to see a Hawks v Mavs finals."
"Well, it's not like he had much of a choice when every player not named Luka Doncic  couldn't hita three to save their life"
2022 NBA Season MVP Luka Doncic

Friendship ended with Luka Doncic  Now Luke Kennard is my best friend
Luka “despite the loss” Doncic
Luka Doncic = the future GOAT
Lol let's be honest here if Trae Young was white he would get a lot more respect in r/NBA. The subs demographic is mostly white/Asian that's why we get spammed with Yuta Watanabe and Luka Doncic posts all season
Luka Doncic is a borderline top 5 player already and has unbelievable potential. Wow.
Doncic and his second 'star' Tim Hardaway Jr just took two superstars to 7 games   Sixers first round wins have been flukes because you're getting sonned by a guy with pubes on his face who everyone says is worse than Luka lol...
Who would’ve thought Trae Young would’ve made it to the 2nd round before Luka Doncic
Trade Luka Doncic to the Houston Rockets   No I’m not biased
" ""I'm taking my talents to South Beach"" - Luka Doncic"

Can Luka Doncic lead a team out of the first round?
They also don't have a Luka Doncic though
"Per cleaning the glass Luka Doncic +2.2 net rating when on court vs off. Trae Young, +10.3.  The Mavs without Luka are better than the Hawks without Trae"
luka doncic and the cleveland cavaliers are eliminated from championship contention
Trae Young has won a playoff series before Luka Doncic
Dallas Mavericks should renamed to Luka Doncic and the trash from the Dumpster
#TRAE YOUNG PLAYOFF SERIES RECORD 1-0  #LUKA DONCIC PLAYOFF SERIES RECORD 0-2
"Luka Doncic is borderline empty stats. Likes to pad in the starting quarters and disappear in the third and forth.   Very good player but winning basketball is more than ballhog the ball (zero defense, zero movement, yelling his coach). Zero playoffs win series said it all"
"More to get people to think about the trade. People will 100% say that the Hawks should not have traded Doncic. Which is fair, but it's not like the Hawks drafted Marvin Bagley with that pick lmao. They drafted Young, who is just as elite. Plus, the Hawks have the talent to overcome Young's shortcommings. The Mavs are heavily reliant on Luka doing it all.  There are similarities between the 2015 Warriors and 2021 Hawks, and 2015 Cavs and 2021 Mavs. So I figured I'd use the 2015 Warriors and Cavs as an example to see how people viewed the Mavs-Hawks trade."
Luka “Ben Simmons” Doncic
luka doncic slows down in the late quarters
Luka Doncic 🤝 DeAndre Hopkins  Push off defenders
For the low low price of Luka doncic
"not the same... Suns are in the WCF playing one of their best basketball in a long long time because the team is balanced... CP3, Crowder and Monty are on the Suns because the Suns have Booker and young pieces like Ayton and Bridges and Cam... the Suns needed a PG leader to get the youth in the same direction... Doncic is not that guy.  What Im saying is, Suns are where they are because they picked Ayton... they would be very different with a Luka and Booker duo...  there wont be a defensive culture, there wont be a Monty, since Igor would be the coach still... Suns would be running a very different system."
And with a second pick in 2018 NBA Draft Orlando Magic chooses... Luka Doncic  because they ain't the Kings lmao
wow cold night for booker  if only they had luka doncic
Luka Doncic isn’t making that dunk!

"Username checks out.  According to DBPM, Nikola Jokic is the 6th best defender in the league. And Luka Doncic is a better defender than guys like paul george, richuan holmes, capela, and smart. And Duncan Robinson is a better defender than Lugentz Dort and Jaylen Brown."

That thinking is what got Micheal Jordan to the Chicago Bulls and Luka Doncic to Atlanta(Dallas)
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Pascal Siakam  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Paul George  Karl-Anthony Towns  Klay Thompson  Trae Young  Zach Lavine  Bam Adebayo  Kyle Lowry  Jamal Murray  Domantas Sabonis  Russell Westbrook  Demar DeRozan  Julius Randle  Rudy Gobert  Ja Morant  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  Chris Paul  Draymond Green  That's 37 that I would rather have on a playoff team than Ben Simmons and I could definitely add more
I'm happy for the Pistons. Grant/Bey/Cunningham is a nice core. I wonder what they do with Killian Hayes? Trade for a future FRP? The Pistions should try for flexibility because I believe Cunningham will have an immediate impact on winning. Want to avoid what's going on with Luka Doncic.
That also means you automatically get Luka Doncic and Tobias Harris.
"If I was the GM, I would have traded Simmons for the # 1 or # 2 pick for Luka Doncic in the 2018 draft? Doncic and Embiid would compete for ages"
"What do you think it was the reason for luka doncic, a 19 year old euroleague mvp and professional for like 5 / 6 years, being picked number 3 in the 2018 draft with 2 college players above him?"
Luka Doncic launches himself into defenders
A Steph Klay cade lineup sheesh as curry and Klay become old and grey we got a light skin Luka doncic
2022: Embiid  2023: Luka Doncic  2024: Ja Morant  2025: Luka Doncic  2026: Zion Williamson
"Lol I love that you're calling other people biased and immature in a thread where you adamantly claim that DeAndre Ayton is a better player than Luka Doncic.  Self-awareness isn't for everyone I suppose.  And good answer to the comment itself, regarding your guarantee of the outcome of a different, 3 year old timeline involving 30 teams and hundreds of players, lmao."
Ben Simmons Luka Doncic showdown 4x a year would be lit. Also finally a god damned lottery pick on the team would be nice.
"Luka Doncic is seeking a trade to OKC for the newly-drafted Cade Cunningham, sources say"
"&gt;even guys like Doncic and Jokic would be iffy  I think Kukoc and a young Arvydas Sabonis line up well with Luka and Jokic, but that's the only example I can think of"
This article is sponsored by Mavericks GM Luka Doncic.
"Luka gets traded for ben simmons, KP and simmons become the main stars for the mavs with Lebron James retiring and then getting brought on as Rick Carlisle's replacement. Dirk Nowitzki moves to Europe, never to be seen again.  Doncic and Embiid drop 40 points each against them in the first game of the season, but have 30 turnovers between them"
I was about say I don’t think I could walk up to any one and ask if they know who Luka Doncic is. Most people can tell you who Lebron James and Steph Curry are
I'm not a Mavs fan and I'm not a Luka Doncic fan. I'm also not a braindead idiot who has to choose between appreciating Luka and Trae.  Seriously stop being a tribal basketball fan and just appreciate two amazing players.
“our player development could fix him”  “luka doncic will know how to use him”  “play him as a 5 full-time”  bonus: “he could be our draymond!¡!”
"Always funny how r/NBA clowns KAT about ""video games"" when their love boy Luka Doncic plays just as much if not more. Yet whenever that comes up, it's all ""omg Luka is just like us normal fans"". And how fair of you not to mention Butler's party life or Embiid's weight concerns. Yeah, you for sure know how hard working those two are compared to KAT and Simmons."
"&gt;Of course it does.  Lol no it doesn't. It's not a current list then. It's a career list for active players and so Carmelo Anthony &gt; Luka Doncic  &gt;Right but Jokic will be higher still because he's reigning mvp. These things matter.  That's complete nonsense. The better player is the better player. If it's Jokic, fine. But it's not because he won an MVP. If the voters decided to give it to Embiid then he's better than Luka? No"
So are Russell Westbrook and Luka Doncic and they're not 6-11 and camped right next to the basket
"Nobody goes to the FBA or whatever the French equivalent to the NBA is for tougher competition. All the Atentokoumpo’s, Luka Doncic, Jokic, etc etc came to the NBA-America to play at the highest level."
"I didn't like the way this post was phrased. Made is sound like the Clippers were getting lit up by Trey Burke and Langston Galloway, it's fucking Luka Doncic and Devin Booker."
Can you imagine what the sports media would be saying if Luka Doncic was in the conference finals?
"I think people ITT need to understand that this isn’t a critique of the level of play for any of these players individually, but rather the team construction and front-office decision making after drafting these guys. both the Suns and Hawks have made great moves toward playoff, and now championship aspirations around the guys they drafted. meanwhile Dallas, after being lauded for selecting Luka and supposedly putting talent around him to be a threat in the west, are on a fast track to middling in 6-10 seed purgatory for the foreseeable future to no fault of Doncic, who has dragged them to any success they’ve had over the past 2 seasons. He’s a top 5 talent in the league and they’re squandering it unlike Phoenix and Atlanta"
I'm happy right now because we have a legitimate superstar and the trade was instrumental in building our current roster.  I have no problem admitting Luka Doncic is a better player while watching Trae Young lead the Hawks in the conference finals.
"Haha, but you have watched Luka play, right?   “I’m not saying Young or Ayton are better but it’s definitely interesting to see their teams have success…”  Come on bro, it’s not that interesting.  Ayton is the third best player on a stacked roster. Booker is a king in waiting and CP3 is CP3.   Luka is throwing lobs to Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith.  Trae is throwing them to John Collins and Clint Capela.  When shit breaks down Luka might have KP to rely on, or he might be hurt. In that case, Tim Hardaway Jr is their next best threat.  The Hawks have Bogdan Bogdan, K’von Huerter and Danilo Gallinari to score the ball if Trae is cold.  I know that no one was big on Atlanta this year, but I thought the roster upgrades were that of a playoff team, and they are clearly a much, much better team than was expected. They are a much better team than the Dallas Mavericks.  Luka might have a bad attitude in some respects, but I don’t recall Michael Jordan being a joy to interact with.  Luka Doncic is one of the best three or four players in the league already. He gets to the basket so easily, he’s so big and strong. He’s an incredible passer, a clutch shooter, and a great competitor.  If the draft happened again, TODAY, Luka Doncic is the unanimous number one pick. Tell me I’m wrong."
Why not Luka Doncic instead?
"And in games 1 through 6 Trae outplayed his teammates and everyone not named Embiid.  Had Huerter, Gallo or anyone had a remotely better game 6 it ends then.  Still, Trae came alive in the 4th ""when it matters"".  The counterargument I'd make is that when Luka's teammates were better from 2018-2020 it was either ignored or even attributed to Luka's greatness.  Well perhaps Capela is now phenomenal compared to his Houston self due to playing with the best lob thrower in the league.  Not to mention the Hawks are doing all this without Hunter, arguably their second best player this season.  If Luka is a 10 then I still think Ayton and Young are at least 8 or 9.  Doncic may always be the best and that's ok.  I just like the guy we got also.  Maybe Reddish doesn't make up that gap but that's hindsight.  That pick could have been higher than 10th."
imagine being happy by passing up Luka fucking Doncic in the draft (??)
"Crazy thing is a couple of years ago two of the teams were dead last and on top of it they passed on Luka Doncic, and here they are in their conference finals. God’s plan"
&gt; Doncic was too good too fast. Kinda the LeBron James problem.  Same thing happened to Damian Lillard but he carried even worse rosters than Luka had on the Mavs this year to higher seeds in the playoff than the Mavs.
"College education actually.  Thwy would NOT get CP3. CP3 has been one of the biggest reasons for Phoenix' success  But what YOU said was this  &gt;Doncic on either the Hawks or the Suns right now would make them title favorites.  This makes you an idiot  Because THIS suns team does NOT have room for Luka  This suns team could trade for CP3. It could NOT trade for a single big who can do what Ayton does  Id you for a second in your peanut little brain think that Luka-Booker who don't complement each other at all&gt;CP3 Book and Ayton, who all complement each other phenomenally and plug their weaknesses together you are a degenerate.  Both Ayton and CP3 cover for Books weaknesses, the same ones he shares with Luka  CP3, a fantastic defender in the perimeter complements Aytons insane paint defense. Aytons massive rebounding abilities allow CP3 and Book, and more importantly Bridges and Crowder to shoot three balls because he can fight for every single rebound  CP3s vision coupled with his and books ability to stretch the D to the perimeter allow Ayton to feast in the paint  This phoenix team works because it has 5 great players without having a massive superstar but you'd ruin all that because Doncic is better in a vacuum  Really shows how shitty your basketball Knowledge is"
"it's a fucking joke honestly, first the narrative was that ""Luka and Porzingis are gonna be one of the best young duos in the league"" and that Trae is an overrated chucker on a shit team who can't contribute to winning basketball.   Now a season later the Hawks supporting cast is too good and the Mavs are surrounding Doncic with bums apparently. The goalposts are moving so damn fast they're gonna break the sound barrier."
Kekw apparently Luka Doncic as SF and Giannis as PF would get crushed
You are describing Luka Doncic   71% at the rim   51% Mid Range   35% on 3s
Luka “despite the first round exit” Doncic
Say my Wiz happened to get top pick every season for 5 straight seasons and having the hindsight of how players turn out…  C: James Wiseman (2020)  PF: Zion Williamson (2019)  SF: Brandon Ingram (2016)  SG: Donovan Mitchell (2017)  PG: Luka Doncic (2018)  Cause looking at what Ernie did to the team…it hurts too much to think on all the Players we missed due to horrible drafting.
Trae Young is in the same tier as Jamal Murray while Luka Doncic is in the same tier as James Harden.
No particular order: KD. Kawhi. Lebron. Steph. James Harden. Joel Embidd. Giannis. Luka doncic. Anthony Davis. Nikola Jokic.  Who you replacing?
"Tbh prior to the draft and leading up to it I'm sure a fuck ton of people in Atlanta were hoping Bagley drops to #3.   I think so many people thought one of the top 2 teams were going to draft Doncic and a bunch of people compared Doncic to Darko Milicic.   Cause I think Suns HC was I think Slovenias former HC and I think everyone and their mother thought Vlade Divac was going to draft the European kid. So we thought hey Bagley would be great.  I get that the last day or two we totally fully bought into Doncic and it was a meltdown when Woj got on the screen and announced the trade. After the trade was announced, everyone on the Hawks subreddit was praying Memphis would draft Trae but they drafted JJJ.   And in the end it's like Luka is at top. A slight step we got Trae and then a drop later we got Ayton and Kevin Huerter and then a drop later we got Sexton and JJJ. And Bagley didn't do too well in the league YET!"
"I like the Slovenia flair. I’m a Suns fan and only see the Clips in passing. As my post history indicates, I’m also a Luka fan. It’s ok to see that Book is counter to the modern heliocentric style of play and that Doncic is the figurehead of that movement"
"If people want to say Trae &gt; Doncic then let them, it's a free country. You making this stupid post isn't making the toxic discourse surrounding Trae and Luka any better. Let's just let them both shine and stop measuring then up against each other."
Luka “Despite the first round exit” Doncic
"The Top 5 picks have all had something to offer. From 5th to first:  * Trae Young is clutch as nails and the face of the Hawks' turnaround. * Jaren Jackson has had injury problems, but was a starter on a playoff team and has shown some All-Star potential. * Luka Doncic is already showing signs of being a future first-ballot Hall-of-Famer. * Marvin Bagley * DeAndre Ayton is a great defensive center and one of the best finishers at the rim in the league."
"Luka ""Empty Stats"" Doncic vs Trae ""Winning Basketball"" Young"
Luka Doncic doesn't exist?
"Simmons can play center for Luka Doncic and Porzingis lol Though, idk how Mavs can get him though."
"I'm clearly joking. I don't think Doncic is a loser, I don't think he's not a great player.   People who tried to defend Ayton by pointing out how he was on a bad team got downvoted in this sub just a year ago. If you try to make the same criticisms towards Luka it's met with instant pushback"
"Doc throws Simmons under the Bus the way he threw PG under the buss.  Ben Simmons did bad, but ben simmons is not why they lost. Doc Rivers is why they lost. They lost game 7 in the comeback loss earlier in the series. They lost when Doc allowed Curry to abused by huerter and looked like Luka Doncic. They lost by not running a decent offense. Doc is why they lost."
Trae was ass today lol. He can thank Huerter. Also basketball is a team sport and Hawks have a better team than Dallas this season.   And yeah delete this. Doncic was selected in first team dude.  And than we are called Luka stans because we have to react to bullshit like this.
"Right? I'm gonna miss seeing 5 threads on the front page every time he takes a shit.  Seriously though, he'll be fine. I was telling my girl the other night just like she knows who Shaq, Lebron and  Kobe are, she'll know the name Luka Doncic some day."
Mavs would trade everyone not named Luka Doncic.
PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Nikola Jokic  That's a championship team.
Doc managed to make Huerter look like Luka Doncic all game because he wouldn't adjust...IN A GAME 7.
"luka ""empty stats"" doncic could take a few tips from a winner like booker"
"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, what a top 3 in that draft."
"The real question is what if every NBA player with the surname ending in “ic” just formed an Eastern European basketball squad go play against an iteration of Team USA.  You’d have Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Boban Marjanovich, Jusuf Nurkic, and Goran Dragic.  That in and of itself of NBA players is a ridiculously good team and would probably require the BEST American NBA players to commit to beat."
"I’ve never seen Luka play offball once in my life, also Booker and Luka would clash egos. There’s no chance the suns org hands the keys to Doncic without Book leaving.  CP3 isn’t the future of the Suns, Book is and always will be.  Clint Capela is honestly much worse then Ayton and a backcourt of Luka and Booker would be one of the worst defensive backcourts in the league.  That team you just suggested would be a second round exit for sure.  Also you are just nonchalantly glossing over the leadership CP3 instilled into the team. Terrible take."
You think he deserved to start over STEPH CURRY and LUKA DONCIC??? Completely delusional
"Luka ""Jeremy Lin"" Doncic"
Devin Booker is about to take the Luka Doncic/Donovan Mitchell role of making ridiculous shots over the Clippers.
Luka Doncic?
"I mean Eurosport is one of the most know sports network in Europe and during summer is like 30% of time cycling.  There is no point to argue with him if he says that he can end discussion with Jokic and Djokovic, as even Doncic now argubly has more awards than Jokic, not even mentioning athlets as Tina Maze, Janica Kostelic, Toni Kukoc, Anze Kopitar and hell he forgot that Luka Modric and Davor Suker even exist."
He beefed with Rajon Rondo and now Luka Doncic. It seems like Porzingis isn't fond of him either based on his post game comments this season.   At the end of the day it doesn't matter how good your coach is at adjustments and gameplans if he is disliked by his players
"What inability to shoot is this lol? His FG percentage last night was better than KD's, his 3PT percentage was equal to that of Joe Harris (better than flop Harden) and his FT percentage was better than PG Luka Doncic in Game 5 against the Clippers."
"Jordan averaged 33.7 points in Game 7s (3 games played). His highest score was 42 points, good for 12th highest all time after this KD game.  The highest active player after KD? Luka Doncic at 4th overall with 46 points. (LeBron has the 5th= spot with 45 points, twice.)"
"He got more votes than Luka Doncic. If I picked Luka, your dumb ass would be quiet as your teams fans right now.   You. Are. A. Clown."
He really isn’t a number one option on a championship tbh. Not a knock on his ability but I think he is more of a 1b guy. He needs a Elite playmaker to play alongside with. Someone like Trae Young or even Luka Doncic.
"Starring Trae Young, James Harden, Luka Doncic, and Joel Embiid"
Luka Doncic ain’t good? The dude who was an MVP candidate his rookie season? Lay off the crack pipe my friend
He’d figure out a way to turn that large pizza and Kali Mist into Luka Doncic
"Zubac and Bev were both getting killed by Doncic. Clippers used a switch-heavy scheme against the Mavs, so Luka more often than not hunted those two down. Resulted in a lot of baskets for the Mavs (which is how they won the first two games before Lue benched Bev)"
This is the thing I hate James Harden not for his own game but for the way he made it possible for Trae Young and Luka Doncic to play. They could both be so entertaining and they just aren't.
"&gt;I promise you the Clippers lose this series with Doc. The adjustments he made against the Mavs and Jazz can't be denied.    He didn't make a random nobody drop 40 on the Jazz (who also apparently has a DPOY) in an elimination Game 6   &gt;  Jazz was HORRENDOUS in the 2nd Half, and Terance Mann ripped them apart. They lost to that man   &gt;  They barely survived the Dallas this year.. where Luka Doncic was clearly the best player on the floor every single game.   &gt;  Are you lot fuckin dumb, or just the narrative in your head changes based on recency bias?      Ty Lue was again considered nothing but a joke just few days ago.. when Mavs was destroying the Clippers and also when the Jazz was up 2-0. There was so many posts about Ty Lue being so shit, and only getting paid because he's ""LeBron's guy"".   &gt;  This subreddit is clown show"
"No I didn't dude. My main argument was   &gt;Wingspans are more important. Luka has 7'2, Mitchell has 6'10, Beverley has 6'6. Mitchell is still closer to Doncic than he is to Beverley.  Then that guy responded with, ""he is not, as you can see, 4 inches = 4 inches, haha imperial system goes brrr haha"".   Well, that's not the fucking point to begin with. The point was despite Mitchell being the same height as Beverley (6'1), he had pretty big wingspan advantage to shoot over him. So his TS shouldn't have been effected by it.   On top of that, i don't even have to know the imperial system. It is soo inefficient and shit that it should have been burried in the 18th century. I looked at Google results, the wingspan numbers showed like this, and I roughly converted it.   On top of that 2, their wingspan numbers can easily be wrong, because those numbers are not direct measurements. We still don't know if KD is anywhere between 6'9 to 7'0. That's freaking a lot."
"The problem is that in this series, it seems like Donovan Mitchell is a one man show for the Jazz, just like Luka Doncic on the Mavs. That doesnt win many playoff series"
"Sauces:   1) https://www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com/nba-players-height-wingspan-vertical/#:~:text=Luka%20Doncic%20has%20a%20wingspan,size%20to%20play%20power%20forward.  2) From 2018.  https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2018/05/18/2018-nba-draft-combine-standouts-measurements-rumors-luka-doncic  I looked it up but there seems to be no official measurement of his wingspan. Idk tho you may be right 7'2 seems a bit much from the photos. But what do you do."
"Wingspans are more important. Luka has 7'2, Mitchell has 6'10, Beverley has 6'6. Mitchell is still closer to Doncic than he is to Beverley."
"Yes, it's not always stats. Boban looks worse in game film than he does on stat sheets. I don't understand why it is that when someone likes a not-so-good player they say ""just watch the games"", as if we should believe that your perspective on game film is more valuable than everyone else's.  The fact at hand is that being good at PnR alley-oops is a more valuable skill. It doesn't matter if Boban is slightly better at a wider range of things if the thing Powell is far better at is the most valuable role-player C skill in the NBA, *especially* on a team with Luka Doncic. Clint Capela's entire offense is PnR and he's one of the most valuable centers in the league. So Boban has other offensive tricks up his sleeve despite not being good at PnR, including ...what though? His 39% midrange shooting? His 13% 3-pointer? These are not good shots to rely on. And the thing is, Boban takes *every shot he's given*, which I can see watching games, and that's why his usage rate is abnormally high. Powell knowing what he's there to do and sticking to it is basketball skill. Rather than settling for a 39% contested midranger, he gives it back to Doncic to reset. Your example of Boban's deeper skillset is his ft% - he takes one free throw a game and averages 0.9 points from it. You can either have an extra 0.9 points or you can have a potent PnR offense play that generates either a Doncic 3 or an easy lob. That's an easy choice  Also an aside on Boban's skill in the paint: he shoots 60% at the rim, which is in the bottom 23rd percentile of all centers in the NBA. He may be skilled but the basketball simply does not go into the net enough"
"this just in: 6'1"" Patrick Beverly can guard 6'1"" Donovan Mitchell, but not 6'7"" Luka Doncic"
Luka “has to learn how to involve” Doncic had 17 assists on his first outing for Slovenia in 3 years. Worth a watch.
Luka Doncic with a bunch of bums put up a better fight against a healthy clippers
"Luka Doncic: I feel your pain, Donovan."
"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA’s golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him “a stud” and “built different.” They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka’s play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then… right? If you’re familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you’re reading this) then you might have an idea of what’s coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there’s lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a “flopper” a “chucker” a “bitch” and a “choker.” I even found two comments that said “I hate [Harden] as a person.” (It’s odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that’s a topic I’ve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what’s different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don’t seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that’s it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, “the Mavs didn’t have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.” r/NBA doesn’t have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players.  [TL;DR in meme format](https://i.redd.it/yw1eh6vyfmx51.jpg)"
"I thought Trae was going to spend his whole career as ""that guy who isn't Luka Doncic,"" but he's already making Luka his bitch. These Atlanta fans love him."
I really do think Trae Young is a better passer then Luka Doncic
"this is sounding less and less like a hot take, but people saying the mavs won that trade for doncic may have been premature. even if cam reddish isnt quite the rotation player yet, given the turmoil going on in dallas seemingly because of doncic and the dominance trae is showing as a showtime star, its becoming a toss up whether you would rather have trae and cam reddish or luka"
"Luka has 2 first round exits but has put up superb stats. His 2 exits were against a much better clippers team, where Luka had a poor supporting cast. I included Luka over Kawhi because even though he isn't as good as Kawhi is right now, he is much younger and playing at a much higher level in his third year compared to Kawhi's. Doncic has the ability to win multiple MVPs, and fMVPs if put in the right situation. Kawhi's lack of durability will also limit him"
Because Luka and Doncic are far more athletic than Larry Bird. I watched both eras live.
"Yea the doncic comparison always exposes people, doncic’s best comparison will always be harden they obviously dont play completely alike but that is indeed the best comparison available  People need to stop trying to force this larry bird/luka comparison  Although i dont agree with you saying bird would wipe the floor with luka lol"
"Three players averaged 20+ drives per game this season: SGA, Doncic, and Trae.  Luka drew a foul on 7.3% of his drives, which was higher than Trae (6.5%) and SGA (5.9%)."
Shades of Terrance Mann passing an open layup cause DPOY candidate Luka Doncic was behind him.
"00:55 Luka ""meme"" Doncic"
Luka Doncic seems insane
"As a Raptor fan, I like this if it means that the Heat can no longer acquire Lowry straight out of free agency without a sign-and-trade.   But as a fan of Doncic, this fucking sucks! Lol. The supporting cast is already weak enough, but take away THJ and Luka no longer has a hype man."
"&gt;Luka Doncic is not a championship caliber player.  This is super-vague.  I would agree that he's generally not a tier 1 player b/c of his defense.  I would say many teams have won a chip with someone as good as him as their second-best, though."
"Aight, this is a fun thread. I’ve got 2 spicy takes:  1.) Jayson Tatum is a legitimate top 10 player who’s season was marred by getting Covid and being on a team with horrible injury and covid luck for the season. If the Celtics had lived up to expectations and JT didn’t lose a month or so due to covid (basically a healthy season) he’d be a consensus top 10.   2.) Luka Doncic is overrated. Luka is a great player and is a joy to watch but his highlight reel doesn’t show his weaknesses. He’s not a very good defender and is an inconsistent shooter. He can get extraordinarily hot at times hitting insane threes but his late clock and clutch stats are not very good. He has a few huge shots to his name that overshadow everything else (that game winning 3 against the clips last year is still nuts).   If you want these hot tales combined I think that Tatum and Luka are at similar levels of play. Luka  is a better passer and Tatum is more efficient scoring and a much better defender. Depending on how you prioritize those will give you an answer to which is better, but it is a legitimate discussion about which of those two. A plug-and-play 2 way wing with some passing chops vs a ball dominant tall point guard that requires an offense built around him."
"I’m just going to copy what I said in another comment.  Alright, I’ll concede that I worded it rather harshly and that he’s probably had more success than CP3 and probably Dame, but I’m not bashing the guy. He’s easily in the top 15 right now, probably top 10 at the moment, and most of the other players at that level have simply done more.   Players in this teir that have done more: LeBron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, Harden. Pretty clear cut. Also including AD, Kyrie, and Westbrook, as the first two won a championship and Westbrook has a Finals appearance and MVP.  Players that have had similar or less success: Jokic, Giannis, Embiid, Doncic, Dame, CP3. Jokic, Giannis, Embiid, and Luka are both younger, but the other two have had less playoff success so they prove me wrong.  My whole point was, who of similar age in the top 10-15 has PG done more than? Well, after really looking at it, CP3, Dame, and if you’re very critical of them then possibly Westbrook and Harden.  Tl;dr - Paul George has never been as good as LeBron, so he didn’t make the Finals on his best team before now. He currently has an opportunity on a depleted Clippers team to change that."

You think Luka Doncic in his second and third year was gonna take down Paul George and Kawhi Leonard without his Scottie? Jordan had the same route Bucks-Celtics-Celtics 1st round and then Pistons b2b before making the Finals
"Luka Doncic is not a championship caliber player.  NBA championships are won by defense and by the team with the most players who can grit through a 100+ game season.  Lukas lack of athleticism and poor conditioning will lead to a shortened career and many early playoff exits.   Also, don't look at my username."
Luka Doncic is overrated
"And then your FO passes on Trae Young, Luka Doncic, JJJ, SGA, etc to pick Marvin Bagley with an incredibly fortuitous 2nd pick in a loaded draft.  Feel so bad for Kings fans, you guys deserve much better."
Thats two years of Luka Doncic sitting in Madrid instead of drumming up his NBA legend. How is that good? 1 year was good for sifting out total busts and hard to scout schools.
Donovan Mitchell -- No.  Zion Williamson -- No.  Luka Doncic -- Yes.  Nikola Jokic -- Yes.  Joel Embiid -- No.

How is Trae &gt; Luka? Trae beat a regular season Knicks team and the Sixers (same team that got swept by the Celtics mind you) who’s number two was Ben Simmons. He’s about to get crushed by Milwaukee. Doncic has gone up against... hmm lemme see  Kawhi Leonard 2xDPOY 2xFMVP Top 5 player  Paul George 7x All Star 4x Def Team 6x ALLNBA    Trae Young never faced that level of competition
Someone on r/NBA will find a way to twist the result of every game into a way to fellate Luka Doncic lmao.
"Jason Kidd next season to Doncic when out of timeouts ""vomit on me Luka. Vomit on me"""
"I legitimately don't think there's been one  It would have to be a team with a star who wanted to trade them as well as had a mountain of future assets. That's the kind of deal, that of course doesn't really exist  Usually when a star is traded, it's to a competitive team who gives up their future to make an even more competitive team (Nets for Harden, Lakers for AD). But I don't think any teams future is worth as much as Luka for 6 years, you can have 20 years of drafting and not get a Luka on a 6 year deal. So you need to craft a deal that involves a star being traded out as well, which of course defeats part of the purpose of trading for Doncic  Maybe, like the Celtics give up Tatum + some combination of picks and young players?   Celtics end up with a new core of Doncic and Brown, while the Mavs get a new franchise player and some picks to rebuild  Maybe the Pelicans give up Ingram + the mountain of picks they own. The later Bucks and (especially) Lakers picks look pretty good  You don't have a franchise guy, but you have a near all-star you can flip or keep as well as the picks that can give you multiple shots at a star while you rebuild"
"If Luka Doncic tries to force his way out with 6 years on his contract the Mavs are still in a pretty good position. They either:  1. Tell him to go fuck himself, he's under contract for 6 years. There's a reason almost no one asks out with 2+ years left; or  2. Trade him for the biggest haul in NBA history. Him under contract for that length is by far the most valuable asset in the NBA"
Coach and GM Luka Doncic plans on hiring J.J Barea on *his* Coaching Staff.
"Assists don't dictate playmaking. Trae is a good passer.   Thus far, Luka has shown a superior feel for the game it is just an all-around better playmaker. He has much better control of the offense than Trae does. The supporting cast around the two of them isn't even comparable as well. Both teams were bad prior to them, but the Hawks got better and got some depth. Doncic Is the superior player right now and it isn't really that close. When Trae's shot isn't falling, It's useless. Doncic is still a smarter player and better at manipulating the defense."
We are fucking losing Luka Doncic...FML
"Yeah people who think Luka is a ball hog are hearing narratives floating around and buying into them. If you watched Mavs basketball all season round, you'd see that Luka makes the right play, every fucking time down the court. What do I mean by ""the right play?"" I mean he is going to find the best look for himself or his teammates. Luka made Zubac unplayable in the first round. He is one of the few players in the entire league, who can target mismatches in real time and scorch the fuck out of the defender he is targetting. Not because a coach told him to do so but because his court vision and real time reaction to defenses is unparalleled outside of Lebron. The Mavs outperformed this season with a roster that looked better on paper than in real life. Kawhi basically sacrificed his body for the rest of the playoffs just to push his team barely past us. I promise you it wasn't the whole of our team that was pushing the Clippers to the edge of elimination. Luka FUCKING Doncic."
Sources tell Luka Doncic is reluctant to share some of his borek his grandma sends him in the locker room and this causes friction between him and the teammates.
"Where did Luka get Carlisle fired? Carlisle told the team he wouldn’t be returning. I haven’t seen a single report about Luka wanting Rick gone.   I also don’t know what you’re talking about when you say Luka has thrown KP under the bus. Every time they ask him about KP he says that he thinks KP is great and that they have to find a way to get him more involved. Even if he doesn’t feel that way he’s not saying anything negative about anyone, so I don’t know where you’re getting all this.  The reason most Mavs fans love Luka so much is because 1.) he’s insanely good at basketball. This is pretty much the first thing that will get fans on your side and probably the most important and 2.) he holds himself accountable. Anytime you hear Doncic talk about what’s wrong with the team or why they aren’t winning or whatever he always says that it’s on him. He always says he has to reduce his turnovers, has to take better shots, has to get his teammates more involved.  I’m not some Luka lifer either. I’ve followed the Mavs since the Dirk, Nash, Finley days. You clearly don’t know what you’re talking about."
"I have a few real life friends who are also die hard mavs fans, they also live and die by the Luka doncic.   As a lakers fan I’ve seen superstars throw tantrums and it looks like Doncic is coming up with all the excuses right now. My biggest pet peeve is you get one of the greatest coaches ever fired because “you don’t like his coaching style”   2nd point is: Luka throwing his costar under the bus all day, if I was KP I wouldn’t wanna play with this guy either   Y’all better watch out, you got a pre-Madonna in the making"
Steve Nash  Rolando Blackman  Luka Doncic  Mark Aguirre  Kristaps Porzingis
PPG first 2 playoff series  1. Michael Jordan 36.5 ppg  2. Kareem averaged 35.2 ppg  3. Julius Erving 34.25 ppg  4. Luka Doncic 33.5 ppg  You can probably get a much better submission if you included the correct stats at least.
"I genuinely cannot believe I have to explain stuff that happened ~3 years ago on this sub, but if you really want me to spell out the complexities of this 'ancient history' then fine.  Here's your statement:  &gt; most mock draft boards were saying ayton/bagley, and moved to ayton as we got closer. The buzz on luka was there, but most boards had him somewhere in the top five.  This timeline is blatantly off. There was never an ""Ayton vs. Bagley"" debate, there probably wasn't even a moment in time before June 2018 where the plurality top two prospects on mocks was Ayton/Bagley in either order, and certainly no point where it was true for big boards. Bagley had a little bit of hype - not number one hype, but still top 2-3 hype - around ~Summer/Fall 2017 (but if you want to try to play it off that that is what you're talking about you're still wrong because MPJ was generally seen as a stronger NBA prospect at that point in time as well), but effectively dropped out of contention for the top spot on big boards entirely by the new year.  But wait you say, you have compelling evidence of 5 different links that support your claim? Surely these draft experts' opinions should be the authoritative voice on the subject, no? And yeah you're right, so let's see who these guys said was the best prospect in the class, let's start by looking at the writers who contributed to the first mock draft you posted, with the aforementioned Ayton, Bagley, Doncic 1/2/3:  KOC: Doncic  Chau: Doncic  Tjarks: Doncic  Huh??? None of them have Ayton number 1 on their big board? What??? But he was the consensus number one pick as you have so clearly laid out. And not a single one of these writers have Bagley above 5 on their boards? How could this be?  Well most of these mocks were posted in mid-June 2018, *after* the Suns and Kings did all but say who they were going to take. These top two's aren't reflecting people's opinions, it's reflecting the fact that everyone pretty much knew who was going 1-2, regardless of their own opinions.  So now let's get back to the original comment I corrected:   &gt; I mean, ayton was the consensus top pick that year, so he was regarded the best player available.  So yeah, this isn't true. You yourself have just provided testimony of three pretty well regarded writers saying no, DeAndre Ayton is not the best prospect in the draft. The most prominent Ayton supporters in the draft media, Schmitz and Givony, even went back and forth between Ayton and Doncic a bit in the year leading up to the draft.  I don't feel the need to discuss this any further because, to be blunt, this did not happen very long ago and if you disagree with the general statements I made in this comment that honestly says more about you."
Which one is Luka Doncic
wtf are these jerseys? i'm half expecting Luka Doncic to be running point for the Bucks
Yeah I mean if I could choose any player I would choose Luka Doncic
"Give Luka any big man that mastered the pick'n'roll and he'll have 11 assists per game. Kristaps is too soft for Luka. Doncic needs a big man that matches his intensity and will to win and exceed expectations whenever they share the floor.   If the mavs can trade porzingis for Myles Turner that would be a good trade. Myles Turner getting spoon fed looks by a premier playmakers is capable of reasonably spacing the floor. He'd be a plus on defense, he hustles for rebounds and played solid in the p'n'r with Brogdon who's, no offense, not in the same stratosphere as Luka.   Indiana gets a guy who wants to be the leader. With more touches and the offense catered to his game I'm sure Kristaps would have a good season with the pacers. If he pans out they're back into playoff contention and if he doesn't they can start a soft rebuild"
"I really want Doncic to do a Jokic style transformation and win MVP the following season. I feel like we are deprived of an all-time great because Luka won't get fit. I know he is already great but when you see Jokic's improvement after losing that extra weight, you have to wonder what Luka would do."
Finally I can stop seeing Luka Doncic undefeated with the Slovenian team posts every day.
1. Michael Jordan  2. Kobe Bryant  3. LeBron James  4. Tim Duncan  5. Steph Curry  6. Shaq  7. KD  8. CP3  9. Grant Hill  10. Luka Doncic  Edit: shit I forgot abour Dirk. He's somewhere in there.
"The one I hate the most is where they just say the player name. I.e. Luka has a big game and someone just comments ""Luka Doncic"" and every single time some other fool will reply back being like ""thats a great point but have you also considered ""Luka Doncic""? Shit is like clockwork"
PG: Stephen Curry  SG: James Harden  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: Cade Cunningham  C: Ben Simmons
"I thought we were going to hear the usual ""Take Luka Doncic!"" retro-blast, but instead we got.... ..... .... Wendell Carter Jr.  &amp;#x200B;  lol."
Luka Doncic PASSES UP WINNING SHOT! Does Luka have the KILLER MENTALITY? Can he ever be the best player in a championship team??
"just someone you recognize that you DONT want to face  in a playoff series. and i don’t care if your team is a one seed and doncic being an 8th seed. there are very very few players that command that same reverence. lebron, luka, durant, and maybe steph and kawhi."
Once he fully catches up it’ll be just in time for Luka Doncic^Jr.
"U are so funny. You put Luka down for having no accomplishments and then compare him to a player that has faaaar less than Luka, but that is now not a problem? LMAO  Yeah, I am comparing, are you? Especially playoffs ones, they are not comparalable, especially given the fact that Luka is getting perma double teamed and triple teamed and having no good player besides him.   U loterally dont check if your argument is valid, u are just here to hate on the kid lol  Edit: I cant beileve I took a bait and argued with a guy who thinks Booker &gt; Doncic lmao"
"There were no goaltendig. For every salted slovenian and pro luka of this sub http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/official-basketball-rules-yellow/2020.pdf article 31.2.3   If you check the replay of this match, the ball touche the foam under the basket so there were no way the balls went in even without block.   But 1 min later, the staff forgot to reset the clock push france to TO and give technical to french coach which lead to a +5 for slovenia.   Referee forgot a flagrant from Dragic on a french player and all Doncic bait was whistled.  Referee was bad in this game and honestly it was more against france than sloven."

Luka Doncic does not lose contests. He wins them. Or he quits them because they are unfair.
"Luka Doncic by quarter this playoffs:  1Q: 85 PTS, 54 FG%, 48 3P%  2Q: 71 PTS, 62 FG%, 57 3P%  3Q: 54 PTS, 44 FG%, 32 3P%  4Q: 40 PTS, 35 FG%, 28 3P%"
"How many white players are even talked about? 75% of the NBA is black. How many stars are there currently that are white? 2? 3? Jokic, doncic, porzingas? Kevin love, maybe?  People destroy porzingas on reddit. Only really jokic and Luka get passes for honestly sad behavior--i hate ref whining for the record."
"""Luka Doncic 'frustrated' with Haralobos Voulgaris and Mavericks management and requested a trade.""  Absolute doomsday"
i said that Kd is a bit better than Luka but i consider giannis and luka on a similar level. Also i dont hate KD i love him but i dont blindly use that in my rankings of players. Giannis didnt even show up to play for his country and has had plenty of bad games before. look at his playoff history than look at doncic.
Wtf did Doncic pass that? He got the switch and had the mismatch he wanted on Gobert. The team  got him the isolation he wanted  and gave him the whole left side of the court to use with only Gobert to beat. I'm sure he'll look at this film and kick himself in the ass.  That was a great game and Luka  is the absolute best even though they lost and he made the wrong play. He's so young and so amazing  ready. I can't imagine what he's going to be doing when he's 29-30. He already understands the game like any real vet. It's going to be scary and he's actually one.
"They got hoopers, none of that non hooper shit like Tim Duncan or Luka Doncic"
"They got hoopers, none of that non hooper shit like Tim Duncan or Luka Doncic"
It's up to debate (and this exact debate happened when LeBron passed out of a double earlier this year) but esp on Slovenia against a soft double team (it looked more like a zone honestly) I would take Luka Doncic for the game over anyone else by a mile. The right basketball play isn't always the right play in the clutch
"They got hoopers, none of that non hooper shit like Tim Duncan or Luka Doncic."
"They got hoopers, none of that non hooper shit like Tim Duncan or Luka Doncic."
Kp can’t even be a second option to luka Doncic in a successful way. He cannot do what Randle did
"Yes, this sub absolutely detests Luka Doncic"
Maybe they will add some pictures of Batum once the Luka Doncic wing of the Basketball Hall of Fame is completed.
"Bruh, the fact that we have go up against the anomaly that is Luka Doncic for our first Olympic medal.. destroys me."
Luka Doncic n'peut pas gagner avec le gros merde Tingus Pingus il a besoin d'un vrai centre comme Mike Tobey
"These games move quickly.  Less than 2 hours.  And, yes Luka is gassed.  I don't understand, have people see a player do absolutely everything for almost an entire game, with an incredibly weak team playing a fairly stacked team, and lead them to win, and look like they still have some left in the tank?  Of course, it was going to require every bit of Luka's energy and abilities. No one was saying otherwise.  Really thought they were losing it in the 3rd, but just a handful of 3-pointers from other players kept them in it.  In the final possession, if you look at the video, Luka repeatedly motions to himself, like as if he's saying ""I'm going to take this"" repeatedly. He made it look a little too obvious. It may have been that he was intentionally trying to make himself the decoy.  And it almost worked. Had the other Slovenian player been able to hold the ball out longer, or run to the basket faster, Batum can't complete his block.  Doncic was running the Michael Jordan-Jim Paxson play, but to open up a drive to the basket for a surefire 2 points. Would you trust Luka's teammates with a 3 point shot, or a long 2-point shot? Of course not. Only a drive to the basket and layup or dunk."
"""Luka Doncic is going to take the shoot, for sure""   Well I am happy he didn't!"
Luka Doncic is 22 lol theres gonna be time for legacy
"It's going to so tough for me watching the bronze medal game.  On one hand, Australia has suffered too much to fall short again. They've have suffered through years of heartbreaking losses and poor officiating... coming so close but that elusive medal barely slipping through their grasp every time. And if anyone has ever been deserving to go out a winner... it's Patty Mills. He's poured his heart and soul into this program, taking it from an afterthought to ranked 3rd in the entire world.  On the other hand, Luka Doncic has been nothing short of inspiring this summer. Slovenia had never qualified for Olympic basketball... until Luka. Taking a country with the population of New Mexico to a chance to medal is just incredible. The dude has literally put an entire country on his back and willed them to within one game of a medal.  Will always root for FIBA Patty first... but I'm going to be heartbroken for whoever comes up short. Both deserve to leave Tokyo with a medal."

"Now I don’t know Luka Doncic, but I still doubt that he cares more about his Olympic semis shooting percentage than he does winning a gold medal. They just locked him down."
Luka Doncic:  * 16 points  * 10 rebounds  * 18 assist - 1 Turnover  * 1 Block   Luka just recorded the second highest assists in Olymics History.  1. Manuel Saenz (1976 games) -20 assists  2. Luka Doncic - 18 assists  3. Steve Nash(2000 games) - 15 assists
I'm not sure who I would have rathered tbh. One one hand Rudy would probably expose our lack of size and poor rebounding even more than they already have been. On the other hand we've now got to face Luka Doncic and a Slovenian offence we might not be able to keep pace with.  Australia has suffered too much to fall short again. They've have suffered through years of heartbreaking losses and poor officiating...
"Lol, you are the bad losers.  I just say Doncic is always complaining, same in NBA. I guess nobody can be perfect.  This sub is pro Luka, you can't say anything against him"
"Depends on the odds. I'd bet $14 for $3 profit if I had a 90% chance of winning. The odds (probability) are the hard thing to figure out, they're definitely not 90% for Julius Randle. They probably are for Luka Doncic as a random example."
"Once again, Nic Batum denies Luka Doncic from advancing to the next round  Game 7 Clippers vs Mavs and now today France vs Slovenia"
Luka Doncic after every possession
"What does this win over a GOAT contender, Luka Doncic, put Gobert in all-time discussions?"
"Luka Doncic? MORE LIKE LUKA DONTSHOOT, AMIRITE?"
Luka Doncic on the replay “He fucking fouled me”
Luka Doncic at the end “He fucking fouled me!”
most passive Luka Doncic last second play ever. Wtf.   Batum with the grown man SWAT.
"It's going to so tough watching the bronze medal game.     On one hand, if anyone has ever been deserving to go out a winner... it's Patty's Boomers. He's poured his heart and soul into this program, taking it from an afterthought to ranked 3rd in the entire world. But so far there's still nothing to show for it as Australia has yet to win a medal in basketball. The Patty Mills-led Boomer teams have suffered through years of heartbreaking losses and poor officiating... coming so close but that elusive medal barely slipping through their grasp every time.     On the other hand, Luka Doncic has been nothing short of inspiring this summer. Slovenia had never qualified for Olympic basketball... until Luka. Taking a country with the population of New Mexico to a chance to medal is just incredible.     Will always root for FIBA Patty... but I'm going to be heartbroken for whoever comes up short.

Sleep: Luka Doncic                                             Woke: Mike Tobey vs Rudy Gobert legacy game.
Luka Doncic
"I think the semifinal is very hard to predict. Luka changes everything. If he manages to read our defense, he can make Slovenia score 100 and we don't have the offensive firepower to counter that. Our defense has been terrible in all our first quarters. If Doncic gets hot from the start, they can get a 15 point lead and then it's game over ."
&gt;a GOAT contender in Luka Doncic   Bruh.
&gt;GOAT contender in Luka Doncic  i think i missed something
Luka Doncic disagrees
Luka Doncic v Rudy Golbert soon. Sucks that I have work tmw. Enjoy the game guys.
"just started watching basketball this olympics, are these the top 5 guys in the nba  1. Kevin Durant  2. Luka Doncic  3. Patty Mills   4. Zoran Dragic  5. Dante Exum"
"Clippers are pending on re-signing half of their roster and will need to rely heavily on PG. They should fight for the playoffs, but definitely not for home court.   Bron/AD/Westbrook Big 3  Gobert/Mitchell/Conley  Booker/CP3/Ayton  Luka/Doncic  PG and Friends  Jokic/Murray  Dame ""I Won't Request a Trade"" Lillard  Ja/JJJ  Splash Brothers feat. Wiggins   And we will have teams stealing wins en route to die for a play-in position. KAT/D'Lo/Edwards could sneak in a 10th seed, Zion/Valanciunas will be a nightmare for teams without a good paint defense, Fox/Haliburton/Mitchell will be as creative as a backcourt can be and Houston's young core is good enough to make some noise right now, as well as the Spurs'.  Honestly, other than OKC and maybe Houston and SA, you have 4-5 times battling for home court and 5-7 teams fighting for the playoffs. People are all over the East being tough now, but the West will continue to be the usual bloodbath."
"Bro you’re acting like the bucks actually beat someone good. The only halfway decent ream they beat was the suns, and that same suns team got taken to 6 by a kawhi less clippers. It’s entirely possible the mavs beat the suns if they don’t have to play a healthy clippers team. Neither the bucks nor the suns played a twam as good as heathy clips.   Luka individually has performed as well as Giannis and more consistently in the playoffs. This is like saying Jordan wasn’t one of the best in the league when he was getting bounced in the first round. He was still among the best his team just sucked. Look what doncic is doing in the olympics."
"&gt;France coach Vincent Collet on the key to the upcoming Olympic semifinal matchup vs. Slovenia: “You cannot let [Luka Doncic] score 50.”  Thx man, couldn't have guessed"
Doncic is sooooo fucking overrated its insane. People were calling him dogshit after he got shutdown in that Clippers series. Now back to jerking off Luka till Jrue-Dray handle him.
"It's still a useful stat, and if it wasn't then your point is moot anyway.  This season, Westbrook averaged more touches than Harden, Doncic, and LeBron, per NBA.com. His time of possession (8.5) is 4th in the league to Luka, Trae, and Harden, with 8.9, 8.8, and 8.6 respectively. For reference, LeBron is at 6.4.  He's a very high usage player however you want to slice it."
The Ayton pick is miles better than the Bagley pick but it’s still a pretty big mistake when you pass on a generational talent like Luka. Imagine how insane a Doncic and Booker backcourt would be.
MVP: Luka Doncic  ROTY: Cade Cunningham   6MOTY: Derrick Rose  DPOY: Nikola Jokic  MIP: Lonzo Ball  COTY: Steve Nash
We need a country by country tally of all citizens named Luka Doncic to actually see who has the most.
"You know about FIBA Patty Mills, FIBA Frank and FIBA Ricky Rubio... but while those players rank in the NBA from very bad to solidly average... you have Luka Doncic who is an NBA MVP caliber player. And the thing is, he came up via EuroLeague where he was MVP before getting drafted. He has that same ""next gear"" as those other things when it comes to international play.   FIBA Luka is a thing.. and it's terrifying for everyone."
"Every all-in-one metric in the public domain – including EPM, Raptor, WS, and WS/48 – all of them say that Devonte' Graham is better than Lonzo Ball.  Except one. The one exception is Real Plus-Minus, which rates Lonzo Ball as the 10th-best player in the league last year – and Devonte' Graham as 15th-best.  However, RPM also rates Lonzo Ball above Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc. So maybe take that one with a grain of salt."
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I’m not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we’ll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, “That is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],” I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I’m not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: “He is not a good runner; he’s an amazing runner. And then he’s an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn’t really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he’s a great kid, he’s smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He’s a treasure, really. He’s going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.” Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I’m positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan — and his shot looks as good as any player’s in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don’t fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I’ll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: “He is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He’s an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he’s a coach on the floor. He’s such a smart player.” Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, “If we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?” Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He’s a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker–type player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him “the best defensive player I have ever coached.” Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
"Being barely ""servicable"" when you were taken #2 over Luka Doncic, Trae Young, and SGA among others is about as big a miss as you can make lmfao."
Luka Doncic or Kevin Durant
why Luka Doncic?
Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic and Giannis level.
A team of -ics would be nasty tho  PG: Luka Doncic SG: Bogdan Bogdonovic SF: Bojan Bogdonovic PF: Nikola Vucevic  C: Nikola Jokic  6th man: Goran Dragic   A bit wonky in the frontcourt but great shooting from all 5 positions and great passing overall.
"You're not wrong, but Trae needs to stop being seen as ""the guy who shouldn't have gone before Luka"" and start being seen as ""an incredible young star on a promising trajectory, and an intensely entertaining player and personality"". The Hawks would likely be better with Doncic, but they still did had a great pick in Trae, and I agree with everyone else, it's high time we stop bringing up the trade."
Luka Doncic
He probably said that Luka Doncic isn't LITERALLY GOD.
this was my biggest issue trying to separate players like D'Angelo Russell from players like Luka Doncic
"What even is a forward at this point. Because you cannot tell me that Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, and Cedi Osman all play the same position."
"Fair enough. Thanks for looking into it. While I don't agree with some of your reasoning, I can't deny the % stats.  Are you familiar with 2017 European Championship? Have you actually seen any of the games? Not that I'd expect you to, just wondering, seeing as you're still somewhat doubting this Slovenia team is for real. I would assume had you seen those, you would be more reluctant to write them off. That run was every bit as unlikely as this one, if not more (other than potential finals vs USA), and they pretty much dominated.  Slovenia vs France (no Gobert, but a great team otherwise): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47dfXNcnUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47dfXNcnUU) (domination in a blowout)  Slovenia vs Latvia Quarter-Final (vs Porzingis, before he was a bust): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-DKtLy9S1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-DKtLy9S1M) (this nail-biter is a must see for any Doncic fan, and a really fun game overall)  Slovenia vs Spain Semi-Final (against 4 years younger Gasol brothers, with a 4 years younger teenage Doncic that has since come a long way): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVSMQQ23b60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVSMQQ23b60) (domination in a blowout)  Slovenia vs Serbia Final (with Doncic hurt with 5 minutes to go in 3rd): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJH6c1oKztE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJH6c1oKztE)  I'm not here to convince anyone, I'm really just debating with people who I disagree with, so I am not posting this to convert you or anything, but rather because I think it's something many Americans are not aware of and would probably find of interest to see, especially since this was Luka before NBA, taking a back seat to Goran Dragic while destroying the basketball empires of Europe.  I'll leave this here as well:  Slovenia vs Lithuania - Olympics qualifier Final, a month ago (vs Jonas Valanciunas and Domantas Sabonis): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTb8CwRp-lc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTb8CwRp-lc)  My prediction: 95-84 Slovenia (unless it's a blowout, which I don't expect, there will be fouling in the end, probably inflating the advantage by some 6 points)"
"ESPN: ""Trae Young says that Luka Doncic is overrated. Will never be a Hall of Famer."""
Trae know he better than Luka can't win a playoff series Doncic. He just being nice
"&gt;Examples of what I'm looking for is stuff like how Tim Hardaway Jr. went from a 34.3% career 3-point shooter to shooting 40% and 39% his last 2 seasons with Luka in DAL.  In his two seasons with the Mavs, Hardaway [shot](https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2020-21,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612742&amp;PlayerId=1629029) 39.9 with Doncic on the floor and 39.3% with Doncic on the bench."
However you want to do things man.   Luka doncic will be one of the greatest players of all time. You can be late to realize it but it’s plain to see for most.
while most r/nba users dont respect kidd and have never watched him play because their all tiny wheewhees. players have a much higher respect level for him. dude is one of the best pgs ever and can teach luka a lot. I actually believe that too many mavs players get cold because he is a one man show in doncic that wants the ball 95% of the time.
"Toni Kukoc was an international star, but at most a talented role player in the NBA.  Luka Doncic doesn't care if it's international or NBA, he's giving everyone that work."
Are there any similarities between Toni Kukoc and Luka Doncic? I'm thinking about the 92 dream team showing Toni who was boss...
"This. What's one year of over-paying Dragic to make Luka happy?  The combination of little moves like this could be the difference between having Doncic for 5 more years, or 15."
&gt;“… and France are through to the semi finals to face the Luka Doncic led Slovenia”  How do you say “fuck” in French?
"Damn right, If the Rockets have any shot in hell of getting Luka Doncic, you do what the hell it takes. Period!"
"I mentioned Luka and Lebron in my post(before I got overwhelmed and deleted it). Luka definitely fits, now that the Mavericks have fully committed to running Luka at the 1, but LeBron's a bit more iffy, since while he's obviously a great ball-handler and passer, he's never really ran point guard as a position outside of the 2020 Lakers. He usually has another guard out there with him, like the last season when Schroder started alongside him. So I don't think he really pushes for the tall PG movement like Ball, Cade and Doncic do.  And Magic and Oscar technically started it, I know, but they're long retired and don't really fit into my point."
FIBA Patty Mills FIBA Ricky Rubio FIBA Luka Doncic FIBA Evan Fournier FIBA Luis Scola  I don't think anyone's beating this team smh
Ricky 'Luka Doncic' Rubio. Let's go!
De'Aaron Fox and Luka Doncic 🙃
Wait til the season after when lebron and AD have to join up with the nets to stop a rampaging luka doncic who is average 55 in the regular season but some suspect a demonic presence within him.
Luka Doncic is now 17-0 with the Slovenian national team.
"Who's this luka doncic fraud? wtf not even the best player on his team, all hail zoran"
imagine luka doncic in shape. god mode.
🎶 He won't srop until they say Michael Jordan is the white Luka Doncic 🎶
"Another term for basketball IQ. Essentially, does the player process what is occurring on the floor quickly and correctly anticipate how the play will evolve based on different decisions / actions taken by players?  High IQ players like Luka Doncic leverage that understanding to essentially manipulate defenses to react to him in a way that opens up efficient scoring opportunities"
"Well I get that you have more to say about his current ability then most. But that's what the draft is about. Trying to pick who will grow into good players.   What prospects are better 3 and D players guaranteed? Even Cade, Mobley, Suggs and Green the top 4 all have parts of there game that can be said to be not ready yet.   Its all a gamble on expected improvement unless you get Luka Doncic level of ready players."
Toss up between Luka Doncic and Ivica Zubac.   National Balkan Association.
Does anyone remember that prophecy guy from the kings sub who posted that he had a vision like a month before the lottery that the Kings were going to get the #2 pick and draft Luka Doncic.   Then they got the #2 pick and the sub all went crazy about getting Luka Doncic... until the team drafted Bagley.
"Sure, for him I want uhhh one Luka Doncic and throw in Giannis while we're at it"
You forgot to mention Mormon Luka Doncic aka Sam Merrill
"Cade is being compared to Luka Doncic, so who would you rather have? AD or Luka?  (Both those comps are dumb btw)"
Michael Jordan is the Luka Doncic of America
"You know, I am starting to think this Luka Doncic guy might be pretty good."
"You were the one trying to argue that GSW had better roster(clearly they didn’t), calling Curry as a failure because he didn’t win the games he scored 37 and 39 while he was the one getting trapped, double and triple teamed all game long because his teammates couldn’t score even when they are open, ignoring Luka getting gassed on 4th quarter of a 7th game(where supposedly stars should close those games and if they couldn’t they are failures), continue to ignore Curry having more votes on both All-NBA and MVP votes for this season(btw Doncic was the favourite to win it before season began). But i’m the one having bias and tries to change the subject. LMFAO. Sure bud you do you and continue to worship Luka as a god."
Some would say the Luka Doncic of Slovenia
"Drose had 2.5 years playing at an all star or MVP level. *Maybe* 3 if you cobble together some of his injury ridden seasons. Luka has already surpassed that. They have similar duration of high level NBA play and Doncic has Euroleague and this hypothetical gold on top of that.  Yes Drose has made a strong comeback as a solid contributor, but that's not really HOF material."
Luka Doncic has also never been 23 years old
"Luka was pretty amazing but lets not act like the Mavs didn't implode. He still has a lot to improve on with his game (which is a scary thought) but to be among the best in the league he has to: Improve his shot selection, he would make shots and then shoot them out of games. Get way more consistent with his FT shooting, it was pathetic at certain points against the Clips and easily cost them a game. 4th quarter impact, you can't be a god for 3 quarters and completely fizzle out in the 4th.   A lot of this will come with experience but people are crowning him way too early. You're not Steph KD LBJ level after b2b first round losses, I mean, you/we didn't even include Kawhi in those ""top"" players when he was clearly a tier or two above doncic in the same series'.   I'd say he's still outside the top 5 pretty definitively. KD, LBJ, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis (maybes/probablys: Lillard, Jokic, Harden, AD)"
Curry who got beaten by Ja morant and Luka doncic is better then LeBron?
"At the same age LeBron had already won a playoff series, finished Top 2 in MVP voting and was about to make his first NBA Finals. Luka is a great player at age 22, but he ain't Shaq, Kareem or LeBron at 22, these guys were putting up MVP caliber numbers while making Conference Finals and NBA Finals, Luka is yet to win a playoff series.  At his age 22 season, Shaq averaged 28/12/6 on 61% TS in the NBA Finals, let's pump the brakes a lil bit on those outlandish takes about Doncic."
"He's definitely in the tier of players capable of being the best player in the world every given night. I think for the NBA crowd to solidify Luka in the same tier as Steph KD LeBron he needs a standout season for people to truly take note.   Imo he played the best series in the playoffs on par with Giannis' finals series. 36/8/10 40% from 3 on 10 attempts per game vs 35/13/5 on 60%fg. I'm not disregarding Giannis Defense in this but I'm also not disregarding that Luka played against a considerably better team loaded with the best perimeter defenders in the league.   If any team can stop Luka it's the Clippers this year but he outright beat them as long as he was on the court. I think overall these all-time performances even out. Luka took a championship squad to 7 on his own. His best sidekicks were roleplayers, not even low-level All-Stars. We've come a long way since then but the 2 playoff series Luka played were immaculate. The Mavs had no business making it to G6 in theory. Doncic is capable of getting wins against contenders single-handedly and those aren't miracle games for him either. It's just who he is and the level of play we can expect of him."
"They didn't know each other. Luka said in the same interview he only met him once or twice and was nervous so he only took a picture.   Idk why you're trying to make it seem like he had a gun pointed at him while saying it lmao. Mbappe idolized Ronaldo growing up, Haaland says Ronaldo is the reason he became a footballer, why is it weird for Doncic to say his favourite footballer is Ronaldo ?  Also this is the dumbest topic I've had a debate about in a while and I just wanna say I'm proud of it lol."
Luka “The Stilt” Doncic.
"He unironically said, after he saw how good Doncic is - that Luka is ""pretty good for a white dude.""  I mean, there's a line there, which doesn't necessarily apply to him.  Can you imagine a pundit in England saying someone like Lukaku is a ""pretty good footballer for a black guy""."
You are just saying that because Luka Magic is a shitty nickname for Doncic and both have Magic in name.
"41 year-old Luka Doncic.  After several successful seasons, opposing teams began employing a Hack-a-Luka strategy, until one fateful evening a young, up and coming Knicks player on a 2-way contract misunderstood Tom Thibodeau's (who's confusingly still coaching) instructions, and brought an actual machete to the game, and hacked Luka's arm almost completely off.   He was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, while witnesses claim he was still waving his other arm, complaining about the no-foul call on the hack. After emergency surgery was attempted, his arm had to be amputated.   Luka took one season off to work on his left-handed jumpshot before returning to NBA play. His playmaking and passing abilities were obviously impacted, but before long he was playing at an above average level again, although his playstyle was often critiqued as ""selfish"" as he rarely passed now.  Late in his career and past his prime, the stars finally aligned and he averaged 29/6/4/1 while starting primarily at power forward."
"“America’s Favorite Son, Luka Doncic” - Carl Tart"
"Lol Luka is rightful a top 5 guy. It is crazy someone still consider Kawhi one of those while basically Doncic is match for Kawhi only coupling with George.   As today Doncic almost equal to Kawhi+PG13. We are talking KD levels of star power almost, at 22."
I used to play basketball with a lot of Turkish fellas and they all raved about Luka. They all said that Doncic was the real deal. This dude can kill in FIBA basketball
Olympic Basketball...welcome to Luka Doncic.
"why is that a joke? If Slovenia were to face USA in the finals or something, and Luka Doncic preceeds to beat their ass consisting of all an All-star lineup and bench, that is something even a championship wouldnt eclipse"
"Honestly if you're not going to kidnap 8yo Luka Doncic and raise him in the USA, a country that you're not even from in the first place, that's just poor GMing"
"Luka ""Bane"" Doncic"
"Luka Doncic in his Olympic debut had 48 points, which is 2nd all time in points scored by a player in a single game... just fucking insane"
"Imagine going from Dirk Nowitzki to Luka Doncic, we’ve been fucking spoiled"
Luka Doncic.
"Luka Doncic is a real patriot!! He will do anything to bring the gold medal to his country, and he will be proud to hear his country national anthem at the podium.   Not like those US players who kneels while the USA national anthem, and disrespect their country.  Doesnt matter how talented they are, when they will face players who will play for milions of people, they will not have the heart to beat them!"
"Give it up for God and his myplayer, Luka Doncic"

"&gt; Led by Luka Doncic, who won the MVP awards in 2023 and 2025, and co-star Karl-Anthony Towns, the Mavericks won the 2024 and 2025 championships over the Nets and Hawks, respectively. Doncic, now considered the best player in the world by a wide majority of pundits, averages 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists in an entertaining MVP race with Hornets superstar LaMelo Ball. The Mavericks look to secure the first threepeat since the 2000-2002 Lakers.  I'll take it."
LUKA TECHNICALS TOO?  THIS IS THE TRUE DONCIC EXPERIENCE
Imagine having the fifth pick and you end up getting Luka Doncic lmao
"Luka Doncic, apparently"
Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic is a bad man
Luka Doncic
luka doncic
Luka Doncic.
Slovenia is by far the best 3pt shooting team. Everyone can shoot aside from Dimec (their bench center). Its amazing spacing for Luka Doncic
"Team success is the only argument. Also maybe some awards. The award argument might actually be worse than the team argument because of the lack of competition for mvp and other awards.  For example, there weren’t many players exploding for jokic, curry, kd, harden type seasons on a yearly basis. The mvp and most awards are way more competitive today.   You’ll also have people who think jordan’s peak was undeniably higher despite lebron holding many records for impact metrics in the playoffs (just go look at his 2009 playoff run it’s arguably the best all time).   Regardless i think it’s fair to have jordan as the goat for now. But it’s also fair to have lebron at that spot. I think it’s clear lebron is the better player but it’s not entirely clear who is greater. The distinction between being better or greater is important. For example, luka doncic is better than larry bird at basketball but he’s no where near as great."
"Sure. I’ve seen posts saying that NBA caliber players can’t play international basketball because “reasons”; that “the worst NBA player on any team is better than the best player from any international team” (despite players like Luka Doncic existing and playing for international teams); I saw a user post something that said “my dad said the NBA sucks ever since MJ left so it must suck, and we are seeing it live on international TV”.   I don’t know, seems like bad takes to me!"
I hope we will see US against Slovenia (european champions) with Luka Doncic...
"&gt;But they also in general just don’t play under FIBA rules so they don’t know how to handle it.  Teams the US have lost to and might lose to later in the tournament are overwhelmingly dependent on a few NBA players who play by those same rules. Luka, Gobert, Fournier, Mills, Thybulle, Metu, Oni, Okogie, Rubio, Gasol- all went to play under FIBA rules after the NBA season and are doing just fine. Hell, Doncic looked just as dominant as he does in the NBA in the qualifiers and went to the line like a billion times against Lithuania, the host nation of their qualifiers.  I think it's more to do with never having developed a sense for fouls and travel to begin with due to being given leeway since their AAU days."
Luka Garza? Doncic isn't American. Giannis would be Greece.
"Yup crazy when you think bout it. MVP and MVP runner up are international. FMVP is international, Gobert is DPOY. N of course theres Luka Doncic"
Luka Doncic : scoring in the NBA is easier than in Europe
"Yeap i agree. This season alone in the NBA: MVp and Finals MVP are international players, Gobert was defensive player of the year. N of course Luka Doncic"
Luka doncic wasn't playing today I'm confused
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Luka Doncic type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
In 15 years it might be Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic in Denver
Luka Doncic will probs change his jersey number to 76 and it gets retired by the Mavericks
"How I started really getting into NBA was following college stars into their NBA career and expanding my taste from there.   For you, along with the other suggestions, I would say to pick a player to follow. I don't know what kind of player would appeal to you but I can give some recommendations.  (I am going to preface this by saying most players I list are on the younger side so you can build  a fan relationship without the dread of impending retirement)   * Luka Doncic - Dallas Mavericks - Young guard who is lighting up the NBA. Very likeable personality and fun to watch. Not as flashy as others but still very entertaining to watch. [Luka Highlights](https://youtu.be/aJBl7RMDlVo) * Trae Young - Atlanta Hawks - Another young guard that is coming into his own. Trash talker, can be flashy on the court, absolutely awesome to watch him play and interact with the fans. [Trae Young Highlights](https://youtu.be/l4Cwaj351aM)[Trae Young v New York Knicks Fans](https://youtu.be/gXPhb1HthNk) * Zion Williamson - New Orleans Pelicans - Freak. He is just an athletic Freak my guy. If he can stay healthy, he is a dominant force and plays the game physically. [Zion Highlights](https://youtu.be/j3RPnA4pvKw) * Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers - Center. Big and strong dude that plays a whole lot of Defense. Sort of troll sometimes, especially if someone calls him out. ex: Andre Drummond [Joel Highlights](https://youtu.be/hxuiQrvKETs)  The NBA is stacked with talent and the youth of the league is fantastic. If you are wanting a current great that I didnt list, you cannot go wrong with Giannis, Lebron, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, or a multitude of others.   If you want to go the opposite route and choose a team first, I would recommend choosing the closest franchise to yourself. It is a whole other experience being able to attend the home games from time to time. If that's not your jam, then I would choose one of the ""younger"" teams so you can watch them grow and compete. Ex: Memphis Grizzlies, Oklahoma City Thunder, New Orleans Pelicans.   If you do not want to cement your choice on team or player, watch the games, highlights, play the video games, get involved somehow to give yourself an interest. I would highly recommend checking out the highlights of some of the greats from the past generations and comparing them to todays game.   Whatever you decide to do, don't take the toxicity you receive from others too seriously. There is no problem with throwing your interest into a popular player or cheering for the Lakers, if that is what you like. Basketball is game and being a fan is about enjoying the product. Remember that."
Most rookies still take time to develop and are not playoff ready. There are exceptions like Luka Doncic but not every lottery pick will be as good as Luka Donic in their first playoffs. The Sixers need a player to utilize the limited time Joel has left and a rookie aint gonna get it done.
"Yeah I think USA will get gold, but Luka Doncic on any team is a problem. Then you got the Gasol brothers playing together in Spain. France &amp; Nigeria are pretty stacked as well. I’m surprised Serbia didn’t qualify after getting Silver last year.  They also have 3x3 basketball this year."
"Luka Doncic gold, Patty Mills silver, thank you"
I dont think mvp winner and runner up should be under luka doncic
"Fwiw, some stats from recent years:  2020 draft   * Edwards: 19.3/4.7/2.9 on 41.7/32.9/77.6 splits * Wiseman: 11.5/5.8/0.7 on 51.9/32.6/62.8 * Lamelo: 15.7/5.9/6.1 on 43.6/35.2/75.8 * Patrick Williams: 9.2/4.6/1.4 on 48.3/39.1/72.8  2019  * Zion: 22.5/6.3/2.1 on 58.3/42.8/64 splits  * Ja: 17.8/3.9/7.3 on 47.7/33.5/77.6  * RJ: 14.3/5/2.6 on 40.2/32/61.4 * Hunter: 12.3/4.5/1.8 on 41/35.5/76.4  2018 (doing 5 here to get Luka and Trae)  * Ayton: 16.3/10.3/1.8 on 58.5/no 3s/74.6 * Bagley: 14.9/7.6/1 on 50.4/31.3/69.1 * Doncic: 21.2/7.8/6 on 42.7/32.7/71.3 * JJJ: 13.8/4.7/1.1 on 50.6/35.9/76.6 * Trae: 19.1/3.7/8.1 on 41.8/32.4/82.9  2017 (note Fultz played only 14 games)  * Fultz: 7.1/3.1/3.8 on 40.5/no 3s/47.6 * Lonzo: 10.2/6.9/7.2 on 36/30.5/45.1 * Tatum: 13.9/5/1.6 on 47.5/43.4/82.6 * Josh Jackson: 13.1/4.6/1.5 on 41.7/26.3/63.4  Couple things that stand out to me. Top 4 picks have historically not been great free throw shooters out of the gate. Only Trae (who isn’t technically a top 4 pick) and Tatum shot at least 80% from the line of the 17 guys mentioned and neither of them made 83%. Since the 2010 draft, the only top 4 draft picks who’ve hit that mark were Kyrie and Porzingis.   Also theres a trade off with volume and efficiency. Zion shot 14 total attempts from 3 so leaving him out. Only Tatum and Patrick Williams shot at least 37% from 3 and they scored 13.9 and 9.2 ppg. And of the guys above with at least 18 ppg, their 3pt%s ranged from 32.4 - 32.9%."
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
1. Kevin Durant  2. (Would be Kawhi Leonard but he injured) Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Luka Doncic  6. Nikola Jokic  7. Joel Embiid  8. LeBron James  9. Jayson Tatum  10. Anthony Davis
"I totally get that. Like I said, I really don’t mean to suggest anything bad about Luka. And what you’re doing saying about the injury is important context (as a sidenote, when im actually evaluating/discussing players, especially when it comes to ability vs results, I very much try to take injuries/fatigue/other factors into account).   But that type of context is exactly what’s missing for the other players on this list. If you looked at either postseason on it’s own, multiple players had more 40 plus point games than Doncic did that given year. And they didn’t all make it further than him. Mitchell for example last year had 3 in the first round while Luka had 2 but then was also playing through injury this year. And KD didn’t even play last year but if you combine this past postseason with his 2019 pre-injury he’s had 6 40 point plus games on the last two postseasons he’s played."
"I think it'd be a mistake pairing a 22 year old Doncic with Kawhi coming off a partial acl tear, has degenerative knees/tendiopathy-whatever, and nearing his 30s and only plays like half the season, if that.  Giannis and Luka would be the dream team up"
"Sample size is still relevant because the limits placed on what games are considered hurt other players on this list.   Murray was injured this past postseason. Murray had all 4 of those 40 plus point games last season. Doncic had 2 last postseason and 3 this one. If you compare one postseason to one postseason, it’s a different story. And Murray got 3 of those in the first round last year so that’s equal to Doncic’s in his 7 game series this year.  On the other hand, you could widen rather than narrow the sample size. Luka was drafted in 2018 so starting from the 2019 postseason, KD (remember he also didn’t play last postseason and played 12 games this postseason to Luka’s 13 over the past two) racked up 6 of these games and Giannis ties Luka with 5."
Luka Doncic shot 20% lower on free throws in the playoffs than the regular season. The numbers very obviously were going to neutralize with more sample size had the Mavs won the series (probably had a much higher chance to do so if he didn't miss so many FTs).
"Yeah but Larry birds game was built for todays game, Hes like a super efficient Luka Doncic with slightly worse playmaking with also the fact that he would attempt like 8 threes a game in this era so he would probably avg around 32/8/7."
"And Luka Doncic. You can argue winniNG ACB MVP doesn’t guarantee he will be a good NBA player, but to say he was an unknown is completely false."
"He averaged 10 assists a year prior. His passing is literally the best part of his game, he just played with dogshit teammates. You can find 30 minute compilations of Cade throwing dimes &amp; his teammates bricking them. He’s an ambidextrous passer that throws cross court passes off the live dribble, similar to Doncic in that sense. He’s not the generational passer Luka is, but he’s definitely got elite playmaking potential, he’s a maestro in the pick and roll"
"2026: ""After years of disappointing title runs and a front office that can't seem to build a decent team around him, Luka Doncic has decided to leave the Mavs organization for greener pastures, signing with 5-time reigning champs Milwaukee Bucks.""   Man, imagine the chaos if this happens lol."

But if you dont wanna do that, here are some good teams you could support:  Bucks: just won the finals, Giannis is pretty entertaining and they’ll be good for many years  Mavs: Luka Doncic is one of the best already at a very young age, has potential to be an alltime great  Nets: KD, Kyrie, Harden, all very entertaining. You would be supporting a superteam though, and they wont be around for many years  Pistons: #1 pick in this years draft, probably gonna draft Cade Cunningham  Thunder: Thousands of draft picks, and have an amazing young talent in Shai Gilgeous Alexander  Lakers: Lebron  Timberwolves: Have been bad for a while, but with Anthony Edwards entering his second year and KAT at center, they are starting to show some promise.  Obviously there are tons of other fun teams in the league, but these are some that I personally think would be fun to support. Enjoy!"
love these! luka doncic would probably be a fun one to look back on!

"Yes, I watched the series.  [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/clippers-vs-mavericks-kawhi-leonard-mercilessly-hunts-luka-doncic-to-close-out-latest-playoff-masterpiece/amp/) is an article that references it. The article has examples too."
"Luka Doncic is eventually going to leave the Mavericks and be hated by their fanbase and it's going to be absolutely delicious.  MOST superstars don't have the Giannis moment winning the title with their drafted team. That's rare, it's why it's so special."
"Yeah, I'm not ready for a Luka Doncic a year older, better and with a better supporting cast. Jesus Christ if they meet the Clippers again it'd be great."
"2 weeks ago chris paul was the 2nd greatest point guard ever   luka doncic was empty stats while devin booker was a championship closer   deandre ayton was top15 asset   and monty williams' ""top10 best inspirational scenes"" was the height of nba coaching    i remember   OH I REMEMBER   ARE WE OUT OF THE WOODS"
"Luka doncic loves that move, honestly hope it get removed Wade really popularized such a bs move lol"
Please tel me some more about how you’re happy you picked DeAndre Ayton instead of Luka Doncic
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."

"A few years ago, I created a custom player using God Mode. I made this player 25 feet tall with maximum stats. I imagined him standing around the free throw line on defense and using his arms to block every single shot by the other team. I was disappointed after simulating a few seasons that he only averaged 4-6 blocks a game. COMPLETELY unrealistic.  Also traded for Luka Doncic in another simulation, he ended up playing until about 45 years old, where he was still averaging about 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 6 assists a game. Had like 5-6 MVPs, 20+ All-Star appearances, 7-8 championships. Just imagine if that came true! Sorry, Kings fans."

The issue with these lists is that they rarely account for draft picks past the year they were made. I guarantee the author of this list had no idea who guys like Luka Doncic or Jayson Tatum were. They just assume that everyone who was good will still be good and some of the most recent draft picks will be good.

I’d probably have to go with Luka Doncic. Can’t wait to see him develop
"This is definitely conspiracy territory here.  You know who else is repped by CAA?  JJ Reddick, who hates the NO front office (if they're trying to appease Zion's agency, why would that have even risked crossing him?).  Also Josh Hart, who supposedly wanted out because he was close to JJ, but re-signed.  &amp;#x200B;  Then if you go across the state line, you'll find Luka Doncic is repped by Bill Duffy.  Same Bill Duffy Cuban literally wrote a blog article trashing a few years back.  There's probably bad blood there, but it's not going to get in the way of 200 million for Doncic.  &amp;#x200B;  Now, if you want to talk agency conspiracies, there was a period of time when the late Dan Fegan basically repped everyone on the Mavs.  Also, there used to be some trivial around that time that I forget the answer to - but there was one agent who's free agents \*never\* signed with the Rockets.  So probably not coincidence  and some agency collusion that does happen.  But it's not on the scale this article would have you believe."

"tl dr   &gt; Does Luka Doncic have sauce? &gt;  &gt; Zach Harper: I think Luka Doncic has the potential for sauce, but I do not believe he currently possesses sauce. I try to live my life by a philosophy of, “If you have to think about it, then your answer is no.” I go with that on whether or not I should move into this new apartment or buy these new shoes, or even when it comes to whether or not I want to order a certain food or restaurant on whichever food delivery service is sponsoring The Athletic NBA Show Podcast. If I have to think about it, then the answer is no. If it’s truly meant to be, then the answer is an automatic yes.  &gt; I feel that way about Luka having “sauce.” He currently doesn’t have sauce. He has moxy. He has huevos. Doncic has the It factor, and I don’t mean he’s secretly a murderous demon clown looking to take down the children of Derry, Maine every 30 years. Luka has a lot of things, and it’s why he’s able to question everything or have free rein with his decision-making on the basketball court. He’s clearly a superstar, and he doesn’t even have to wait to win anything in the NBA to garner that distinction.  &gt;  &gt; Sauce is different, though. Sauce is the extra flair that legitimizes placement on every Instagram highlight account ripping off every other Instagram highlight account. That’s not a knock on Luka, either. He has the capability of acquiring and holding the sauce. But there isn’t quite enough flair, and that might be a situation about his handle.  This is the bullshit athletic is trying to make you pay subscription for."
"He's well worth the rookie extension max. When his contract is up a lot of teams would be happy to give him the max (they would offer him more than the rookie max if they could)  Is him at max equal to value to giving Luka Doncic the max, no, but the Suns aren't going to get Luka or anybody close to that caliber if they let Ayton go. With Suns being contenders and you already having committed to CP3 its kind of crazy to me that they are risking angering Ayton here."
Max contracts have got to go. The market is just completely fucked at this point. You gotta pay Ayton the same as Luka Doncic if you want to keep him. It's silly.

"*That's not an offensive chemistry thing, that's a bad bad bad fit in terms of defensive scheme.* Look at the OffRtg and DefRtg separately, and you'll see Mavs improve markedly on D regardless of which one sits.  Basically KP has been limited to playing two defensive PnR schemes (especially after the second knee surgery) -- either deep drop or zone. But he's not been very good in deep drop, and has been needing the other defender to get over the screen. Guess who can't get over screens well? Luka. Or indeed anyone else in the Mavs' starting lineup much of the time -- Finney-Smith and Hardaway included.  On the other hand, the biggest benefit of having a 6'7"" PG is not having any short (in the NBA context) people on the court. This should allow you to play more aggressive coverages, show high, even switch. Except that's impossible when KP is on the floor -- especially after the second knee surgery his mobility just wasn't remotely good enough for anything like that. A correctly constructed roster around Luka would be one that can employ a switch/show heavy scheme when appropriate, while a correctly constructed roster around KP would be optimised for a drop-only scheme.

"&gt; 1-3 (one of those loses being in overtime) vs the eventual champions despite having over 50% of their payroll, including their second and third best player, either sitting or playing highly injured.  I'm not disputing that KD in the series was incredible and achieved something incredible. I'm picking at the sleight of hand of crediting him with achieving a 7 game series *on his own* when the majority of those wins were with Kyrie Irving. It's just that. I am still someone who on most days thinks that KD is the best player in the world.  &gt; Please show me an example of a player carrying a team to game 7 if you don't count KD  Luka Doncic, Clippers/Mavs 2021. I don't think Luka is better than KD, but this is the problem with weighting so much on a handful of games."
Luka Doncic
"In both Westbrook's case AND Luka's, stat padding to make it easier to get Triple Doubles is absolutely the goal.  Today's NBA wants to market its players as the best ever.  So NBA teams have agreed to allow more uncontested rebounds.  The NBA wanted Westbrook to outdo Oscar Robertson in Triple Doubles by any means necessary.   Saying that getting the ball in the hands of a guard 80 feet from the basket initiates offense better is BS.  Top Centers have been initiating offenses with full court outlet passes forever.  If today's teams are initiating offenses so great, why is it today's teams do not score as much as teams from the 1960's when there were no 3ptrs?  When 1 player has to box out so another player can get a rebound 80 feet from the basket, that man boxing out is one less guy on the break.  Its better basketball for the playmaking guard to be near halfcourt and catch an outlet pass from whoever boxed out; a 3 on 2 fast break is better basketball than a full court hail mary.  Yet full court Hail Mary type passes are more spectacular highlights.  Lastly, guys don't get ahead of the defense by recognizing that a guy like Westbrook or Doncic is about to get the rebound.  Guys get ahead if the defense when they recognize a teammate has successfully boxed out, which is two (or more) steps earlier than when Russ or Luka gets the rebound.  Therefore, it is actually the successful box out that actually initiates (triggers) the offense."
Which is a year older than Luka Doncic who will be going into his 4th season with the Mavs.
The age gap between Jalen Brunson (25yo - 2018 class) and Kristaps Porzingis (26yo - 2015 class) is smaller than the age gap between Jalen Brunson and Luka Doncic (22yo - 2018 class)
"That's true, but you also have to consider that Trae Young is closer to Luka Doncic than Doncic is to James Harden."
"Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, soon to be Luka Doncic, gonna be the players literally everyone gets compared to for the next decade."

"Welcome to the NBA. There are a few historical basics:   1)Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. Many people including myself believe that Lebron James can catch him but it'll require a few more accolades.   2) Some of the greatest NBA teams of all time are the 60's Celtics, 80's Lakers, 90's Bulls, 99-03 Lakers, and mid2010's Warriors.   3) There have been more and more rules introduced to make it harder to play defense because flashy offense is what crowds love and brings the big $$$ to the league.   4) Lakers-Celtics is one of the biggest and most competitive sports rivalries of all time.      Now some points that are relevant to this season and more recent times:   5) The Warriors team mentioned above was so good largely due to having two of the best three point shooters of all time. They helped influence the league to dramatically increase its rate of three point shooting.   6) The Lakers and Nets are the championship favorites this year.   7) Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, James Harden, and Luka Doncic are currently regarded as some of the best players in the league.   8) Enjoy the NBA! During the season there are games every night so there's always some NBA action to watch. It's a beautiful sport. I hope that the Lakers become your favorite team."

"No. Chad Ford put it well on his podcast last week so I'll summarize. I would highly recommend if you're looking for draft coverage. As far as podcasts go, I'd say he's on par with Givony &amp; Schmitz.  1. The Euro league teams have no incentive to develop players so they can declare for the draft unless those players are advanced enough that they can help them win immediately. Considering there's a rise in competition and everything else that comes with playing professionally, unless said youth prospect left for Europe for at least 2 or more years, spent time getting little minutes and earning more faith from coaching, it's just not to their benefit.  So you can the difference in the amount of minutes and role an Alperin Sengun got as compared to Luka Samanic for example. Or even, Doncic Vs Killian Hayes. And why comparatively of the two, even the coverage was about flashes of brilliance for Hayes &amp; Samanic versus actual current production for Doncic and Sengun.  2. Not when they can go to Australia, the Overtime league, the G league or universities chasing one and dones.   This year should be extremely interesting for prospects. With all the available options. So if you listen to the podcast pasted below, you'd hear the breakdown on each interesting international prospect and why they chose either of all the available options.  https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BCHsH1UfpxoEYSXOCubc6?si=RDB19CMuScmFa_4O70LBaA&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;dl_branch=1"
Honestly I think Trae Young &amp; Luka Doncic are worse than Harden at this point
Luka Doncic is the all time playoff PPG leader
I think if you want to say luka you have to include trae.    I think doncic has the edge but trae is right there with him.    The magic and bird or Kobe and Duncan of the 2020s.

"That's it.  That seals the deal.   I am no longer a Luka Doncic fan.   I officially will not be wearing my Luka jersey nor will I be renewing my Maverick season tickets ever again. I'm taking my fandom to South Beach, where they know how to vaccinate properly."
"&gt; Luka Doncic, who earlier this year said he contracted COVID-19 last offseason, was asked point-blank on Monday whether he is vaccinated.  &gt; “I mean, yeah, but I want to keep it private,” he said. “Everybody should have their own choices, what they do.”  Is that not about Luka?"
"That's not how it works. We're talking about his trade value, not his value to Philadelphia. His trade value is a combination of how much Philly values him and how much other teams value him. It doesn't matter if Philly's value stays consistent, his market value does change. The transaction doesn't need to occur to estimate his current trade value.  Luka Doncic has 0% chance to be traded. That doesn't mean he has 0 trade value because no trade will happen.  I can claim that I won't settle for anyone except Kate Upton in my bed. Kate may say that she isn't interested until I become a billionaire. Well, currently, i'm not, so I have no value to Kate currently. If I gained a billion dollars, I would. So my value has changed regardless if Kate's conditions changed or not.  Again, I don't know how I have to spell this out in such detail. Negotiations have two sides. Any transaction will be based on a COMBINATION of the wants of both sides. That's how things work."
"So, what should I do? Sit down and cry in the corner? Go to Indy and sell my kidney for Rick to come back? Change teams and hop on a bandwagon?  I'm a MFFL. I'll see the bright side. If I'm to be gloomy about stuff, I'll just quit sport and focus on my daily life, it is more than enough gloom and doom there. We have a deep defensive personnel, that are both talented and versatile. We have a roster that apparently were at odds with the former coaching and also apparently bought the ideas of the new staff. We have the former Euroleague winning coach and very successful in Europe in the staff. We have Luka Doncic.   Do I think we'll win? No. I think we'll bounce in the 1st round again, with Kidd, Rick, MDA or my mom as HC. But if I'm to whine, I would just post on Simmons threads. I want my team to win and, until they give me tangible evidence they won't, I will think my team will win, yes. I'm not in the karma business."
"Carlisle was a menace here per multiple reports. He was just a giant asshole. Luka didn't like the way he treated bench players. On his way out, he recommended Kidd as his replacement over his own assistant Mosley cause he felt Mosley was closer with Doncic than with him."
"What a giant crock of shit. Everyone has implicit racial bias to a degree, there's no denying that. However, it usually manifests in the form of prejudice. Your brain naturally fills in the gaps of missing knowledge about a person, making assumptions based on their noticeable characteristics like skin color.  The way we form impressions of NBA stars like Harden and Luka is completely different from the way we form impressions of a random person on the sidewalk. When we see James Harden or Luka Doncic, we know exactly who they are. These are two of the most recognizable athletes in the world. Making inferences from Harden's complexion does nothing, because knowing that it's James Harden give us infinitely more information. That's not to say that NBA fans know what Harden is really like, but we've had so much exposure to him that knowing his skin color is totally meaningless in forming our opinions about him. The same goes for Luka. We've seen them play over and over and over again. We've seen their (public-facing) personality. Those are the things that factor into fans' judgements of a player.  There are so many differences between James Harden and Luka Doncic, I don't need to list them. All I need to do is point out that if you ask someone why they prefer Luka over Harden, they will give you an answer. When they point out one of the many differences between the two players, do you think they're lying? Do you think it's just a product for their racial bias? If so, how could they possibly convince you otherwise? No amount of reasoning or evidence will disprove your theory, because your theory isn't built on evidence in the first place.  There is no logical basis for saying that NBA fans prefer Luka over Harden because of their skin color."

"Luka Doncic kind of looks like Adriana Lima, anyone else see it?"
All the advanced stats say he's better than Doncic though (by a solid margin at that) and it's not like Luka can use the team success argument either.    Both of them are single handedly carrying mediocre rosters and were the 2 best players in the first round
Great news for the mavs. Luka had an unsustainable usage rate and was exhausted every fourth quarter . Unlocking porzingus will help the mavs even if he isn't as efficient as doncic.

"Yeah exactly. I know it's kind of arbitrary, but there's definitely a reason the only rookies to ever average at least 20/5/5 are Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, LeBron, James, Tyreke Evans, and Luka Doncic. It's not easy to do  I think that if Reke was drafted by a better organization he could've had a much better career"
I guess luka doncic is here to answer that question
Luka Doncic wins the west with Ben Simmons as a teammate. Sixers couldn’t even beat the hawks
ITT Mavericks fan that watch the Mavericks trying to convince random NBA fans that don't watch the Mavericsks that Luka Doncic is a PG.
"I like the confidence, but he's not quite top 5 yet.  Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday, (even) Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Jamaal Murray, Steph Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard are all better.  You could argue he is a top 10 PG. He is definitely in direct competition with the likes of De'Aaron Fox and D'Angelo Russell.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Forgot Westbrook. Yeah, Morant isn't quite top 10 yet."
I mean how luka is regarded is a joke to me. Trae and doncic are very similar players and belong in the same tier.
Yeah it really is puzzling to see that some people are so low on Luka Doncic. He's been in the league for three seasons and it's quite obvious that he's a generational offensive player. I dunno how you could've watched him do what he did against the Clippers over the last two postseasons and conclude that he's overrated. He was kicking the shit out of them. It's not his fault that Porzingis was injured and/or a literal pylon.
"Lowry and Rondo were mainly designated as chasers to shooters and Curry and Paul (among Lebron and Luka as well as handful of others) were mainly handling helper responsibilities in defense trying to avoid being involved in point of attack defense wherever possible.  Personally I'd be fine with how they are currently classified so I'd be happy to count Luka and Lebron as point guards just as I would counting Curry or Paul. If I would question any players that are currently defined as point guards it would probably have to be Ben Simmons and Bruce Brown due to their offensive roles, but even then I'm fine with it.  Personally I'm not quite sure how useful or meaningful the position label in itself is due to the fact that no matter how you slice it there will be players with various offensive and defensive roles included.  However as an example Luka Doncic, James Harden, Chris Paul and Lebron James all had exactly same offensive and defensive role. So at least personally I struggle to see what separates Paul from the 3 others as they were all classified as point guards last season. Harden is only one where I could see clear argument since he had dual position. But comparing Paul and Luka for example I just feel that all the arguments basically come down to the bias of Paul is short and Luka is not. Like neither of them is trying to guard the point of attack on defense if they have a choice and both of them generate their offensive value in a similar manner."
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."

Tyler herro vs luka doncic who’s the better great white hope?
Herro as many points as Luka “Euro Fraud” Doncic
Luka Doncic and Jimmy Butler are the same height and weight...
"Because in their second year when ""they really came into their own"", Doncic's team had twice as many wins as Young's while playing in the more difficult conference. He also made the playoffs and had a good first round play against one of the title favorites. Also has the clear advantage in rebounding, which led to an unprecedented number of triple doubles for such a young player.  Trae had great numbers but when players with great stats (especially high usage players who dominate the team's game) haven't led their team to success, big stats get translated as ""empty stats"" by many fans. It was during this season that Doncic was seen as the best between the two by most fans. Last year Trae was successful with his team and the perception changed by a lot. He might not be seen as better or even equal to Luka yet, but the narrative has clearly changed."
I just think Luka is more marketable. Maybe it's because of his joking and demeanor. I personally enjoy watch Doncic much more than I enjoy watching Young.
Luka Doncic is almost universally regarded as a generational talent- because he is playing professional bbal since 16 at highest possible level
"In every assist stat, Trae has been superior to Doncic at any point in their careers.  More assists and less turnovers. Better looks generated, and faster decision making. It's no competition between the two.  Luka is a second tier playmaker with Ja while Trae is fighting for the. best alongside CP3, Jokic, and Lebron."
How about one Luka Doncic in return ???
"You have to take into accountsupporting casts and the importance to their team. Luka is the mavs. In the playoffs last year Trae had games where he shot like 5-25 and they were still winning. The hawks also beat the Bucks without him playing. The hawks probably have the deepest roster in the league.  In terms of passing ability, Trae is good whereas Doncic is generational, larry bird esque playmaking. (which by the way is not going to be derived from raw assist numbers). The only area where trae is probably better is shooting but Luka being bigger and having an insane release evens things out. Luka at very least a top 10 player in the league I dont think Trae is quite there."
Luka doncic is the best player.
" LaMelo, RJ Barrett, Luka Doncic,Tatum, Brown, Embiid, Beal  The only bad one really was Okafor  The meh ones are Otto, Kanter and Favors  Damn #3 is stacked"
Any team with Doncic on it is a contender. Do the Mavs have one of the worst rosters in the league? Absolutely. They also have Luka Doncic
"For the Kings- Jumping up in the lottery to #2 and feeling ""Holy shit, Luka Doncic is gonna be a King!"". The rest is history."

Luka Doncic y’all know why
"He is one of the few lottery pick player of Mavs. Other than Doncic most of the Mavs rotation players were drafted late 1st, 2nd round or undrafted players.  So Frank, WCS are bench players but arguable they had higher ceiling than rest of the roster that is not named Luka."
"I did not say Gobert is not top 10 simply because his team lost.  I explained that players who are top 10 with the Jazz roster would take it to the Finals. The Jazz roster against last years Western Conference was enough for Embiid or AD on to get them out of the West last year. Their inside presence offensively would be so dominant with the ball handling and shooting around them and they can also serve as quality defensive anchors while being a bit better on the perimeter.   Gobert does not provide enough on the offensive to cover for flaws that a roster may have. Luka also took the clippers WITH kawhi to 7 with a worse roster than Utah and without very good perimeter defense. And those are the 3 guys ranked in the bottom of the top 10.  Also LeBron's Cavs team was also much much much worse than the Jazz roster which literally has another all-star and top 25 player next to Gobert. Lebron, literally made the Finals though. That's so much more than not ever getting past the second round lol.  But Who is Rudy Gobert better than out of these guys? Because that's the only conversation that matters when talking about top 10.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis.  I think there's seasons around 2013-2015 where Gobert these past two seasons could have been top 10 but he's not in this current NBA."
Luka. Doncic.

That’s how Rick Carlisle used him, and what did was the result of those “bad” shots? 29 points on 55% eFG (which is better than Curry’s current eFG%, and Steph won Player of the Week with it) and the league’s 9th best offense. Dallas had a better OFFRTG than the #1 seeded Sixers, granted them the #5 spot in the West despite below average defense, and pushed the Conference finalists to 7 games. So clearly the “bad” shots weren’t the problem for Dallas.  The hell are you talking about? High usage is a bad thing, no matter how you try to spin it."

"Luka hates this situation I can guarantee you that he does.  He was a but spoiler with the fact  that his teams from early one got better every year. He was in one of the best organisantions in europe if not the best.  He has the sam.emntality hd had in the end of season 1 when the lost games to get a high deaft pick.  In wueope we don't have this system, we hate it.  Our fans would literally behead a coach of team managment if the tanked.  He is uninspired and hates it.  And this is jot just on the court.  His conditioning isn't improving, he isn't ""playing himself into shape last year"" becouse he hates the situation.  And believe me, if mavs don't get their shit together, he will leave. Its questionable how much better the team was alst year compared to 1 year back. If you take thw enxt step luka took and calculate in the fact thqt they traded seth away, they were pretty much stagnand.  Kidd is a new coach. Doncic wants to win, he fucking hates losing. Dude is emotionals as it gets.  He will start hating the mavs and go to a franchise that has assets and an winning mentality.  Mavs fans will downvote me to hell for this, but this is happening if things don't change.  This isn't dirk, the managment nqd cuban are being greedy. If they don't deliver, he wont be blindly loyal."
"Unless you want to argue luka has never had an off night prior to this I don't really see the point. Yes if doncic didn't have an off night the offence would have been better, but that doesn't mean that doncic having an off night the sole reason their offence was bad."
Beal&gt;Doncic all day. I love Luka but painfully overrated.
"Not if you’re Luka Doncic, who’d be getting max contracts for many years to come with a grumpy newborn as an agent. He’s got other concerns."
"You forgot to name the honorable mentions:  * LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers * Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers * Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat * Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks * Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves.  I'm annoyed they even put Lebron's and/or Luka's name on there if this list is supposed to be a current ladder."

Which team traded out of Luka Doncic for their starting point guard and spent the most money in the league in free agency last off-season?  Expectations were significantly higher for Atlanta than for New York heading into opening night. Julius Randle has been a pleasant surprise but Trae will always be held under a microscope while he wears an Atlanta jersey. That’s just facts
Luka Doncic is a bastion of white supremacy

trae young devin booker luka doncic ja morant
I'm holding them to their contemporaries. Trae was drafted after Luka after the trade so I'm expecting the Hawks think he'll be better or at least on the same level. I'm not seeing that. This doesn't mean Trae sucks just a little underwhelming. Same goes for Ayton and especially Bagley.  No knock on Trae but Doncic is already looking to be the next GOAT talent. Trae on his best day isn't matching Luka especially on defense.
"Next generation showed out this weekend  Luka Doncic: 31 PTS, 10 REBS, 11 ASTS  Devin Booker: 34 PTS, 7 REBS 8 ASTS  DeAndre Ayton: 21 PTS, 16 REBS  Trae Young: 32 PTS, 7 REBS, 10 ASTS  Dillon Brooks: 31 PTS, 7 REBS, 2 BLKS  Ja Morant: 26 PTS, 4 REBS, 4 ASTS"

zion and luka doncic lmao
"No they aren't, they are on a hot streak, but they are effectively the same team they were last year (swapping Seth for J-Rich) and they were 10th in 3-PT%. They take a bunch of threes, but that doesn't mean they are one of the best shooting teams in the league, they are good, but they aren't close to the level of efficiency that teams like the Clippers, Nets and Bucks have.  But as i said, if they shoot 50% from 3 because you are doubling Luka and forcing the matchup with Kawhi/PG you shake their hands and congratulate them, but the odds of them shooting close to 50% from 3 again and the Clippers (who are the best 3-PT shooting team in the league by a mile) shooting less than 28% again are astronomically low.  The Clippers are by far the best 3-PT and FT shooting team in the league, they can and should win this series either way, but it's clear now that their strategy of switching everything and not consistently doubling Doncic isn't working, it didn't work last year aswell when Luka averaged 31/10/9."
Luka doncic. Just saying
"They do. [And he’s listed as 6’7”](https://www.nba.com/player/1629029/luka-doncic/profile), which is obviously perfectly reasonable rounding, especially since no heights are listed with fractions of an inch.  Yet he’s routinely described as 6’8” or even 6’9” when people eyeball his height. My thinking is that that’s because other players/announcers/... are just so used to inflated heights that their perception of what height they see corresponds to which number is skewed by an inch or two."
"because people like Bev more than Doncic. Pretty simple.  Saying that race is a more sensitive topic than height is a BS excuse. Plenty of people are sensitive about the height, NBA players included who have to work ultra hard to make the league if they aren't tall and dont have innate physical gifts.  But of course, Bev isn't gonna go on a campaign against Luka for those comments. because its just a part of trash talk. And Doncic didn't go on a campaign against Montrezz. Because its a part of trash talk too. It was other people who got offended for him, that are choosing not to be offended now."
"I mean it was pretty obvious how much more complicated it gets to stop the elite distributors like Jokic, LeBron or Doncic in the Mavs game.     Luka cooked his defenders in the first half and then got double teamed most of the time in the 2nd, which made his shooting numbers go down but he didnt care really as he still reached his teammates with all these passes which allowed THJ or Finney Smith wide open 3s or the easy dunks for KP for example."
"I'll never understand shit like this, Luka Doncic had just won EuroLeague, EuroLeague MVP and EuroLeague final four MVP at *18 years old*. Anyone that still pretends Ayton was the safer pick just wasn't paying enough attention at the time or was letting their bias against European players blind them to what was actually going on."

You don't let a GM that is fearing for his job make the draft before you terminate his contract. Poor owernship decision by Sarver. McDonough made the safest pick and selected the popular hometown player who the local fans and ESPN wanted.  It's no surprise Donnie Nelson took Luka Doncic. He was the first GM with a lot of job security in the draft.

"Luka Doncic is a fictional character bro, nowhere does it say in his story that he has to be white"
Luka Doncic is my favorite player but here  Tatum is the better defender and it’s not close at all  Luka is a foul baiter and whiner and not a real man  Luka can’t get it done in the playoffs (I know he’s had one entire series)  Empty stat padder
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"PG: Luka Doncic SG: Jaylen Brown, SF:  Jayson Tatum, PF: Ben Simmons, C: Jokic  Not only do I have scoring, defense, length and multiple ball handlers mixed through out this line up, I have longevity.   Picking guys like Steph, Lebron, Kawhi and KD would be better.....for a couple years. All of them are in their 30s and have a lot of mileage. KD, Kawhi and Lebron are getting hurt more than they ever have recently which shows they are slowing down. My line up is tearing up the league for a decade+."

"Ah yeah, I instinctually don't really think about Doncic as a PG in the same way as Lebron, but I guess if he lines up as one they're up there too.  THJ or Richardson are going to be the worst 2nd guy of any of those backcourts, but Luka probably makes up the difference."

"&gt; I’m not trying to be the annoying “I told you so” guy   I am.

Not only will he not return even 90%, his rich injury history gives this a very high chance of becoming an albatross poison deal. &gt;  &gt; They're lucky Doncic is super young, but 3-4 years from now this will look Batum-like bad. Absolutely needless risk. &gt;  &gt; They'll probably end up stretching him or trading him along with picks to sweeten the deal along the way (or get some other shit contract in return)."
"Man never heard of Luka Doncic, the white Larry Bird"
"We're talking about NBAs shit post material Ben Simmons, not the golden child Luka Doncic"
"Because they are trying to give Luka more credit. It's funny. It's almost like the Schlenk did his job in assembling a team and getting that extra asset when he ""traded away doncic"" crow is what they all eating now. Most trae haters didn't even watch the hawks. Built on ignorance"
"yeah dude was in the finals with a worse supporting cast than Doncic , lets see how far Luka goes now. DIdnt lebron score like 23 straight points plus a go ahead bucket against the pistons in the playoffs?"
"Conversely Luka Doncic has 29 and is playing the game of his life and Mavs are down 8. Mavs have a shot, but it's not a good shot."
"If Luka Doncic had Trae Young's supporting case, they going to the Finals easy."
I saw Luka Doncic at a grocery store in Dallas yesterday
"Fuck it, I'm saying it. Luka Doncic is the best European player of all time"
Eerie similarities between Doncic and pre-Heat LeBron. Singlehandedly dragging a bunch of second-string caliber players through the playoffs. Luka needs help or else he should demand a trade
It's god disguised as Luka Doncic
"Luka Doncic woke up and said ""F The Clippers"""
Luka fuckin' Doncic!
What the fuck is Luka Doncic
"JVG: ""Luka Doncic would agree he has to play better in the second half if they're going to win"" 29 points 5 assists in the first half  OK Jeff"
"Luka ""This is My House"" Doncic"
Luka Doncic is my dad
&gt;Is Luka Doncic the best person ever to do anything of all time?  People are so eager to call him an all time great. It's crazy.  Let the guy have a career first. Jesus.
"You both are bringing up numbers when the post states that I am clearly just talking about the skillset, not about how good the players were. Obviously Kareem and Jordan were better at 22 than Luka Doncic. (allthough its debatable if the average competition was as good as today, but thats another story)."
If they're in a Game-7 against a hella stacked Clippers team is just because Luka Doncic.
"If you take the literal meaning of MVP, it has to be Luka Doncic. He’s going to dominate this league for the next decade"
I don't know exactly what it is.. But Luka doncic has that IT factor
Luka Doncic is out of his cotton pickin mind!
"""*Hope you're enjoying the game so far.*"" - Luka Doncic"
Did the Hawks and Travis Schlenk basically get an older version of Luka Doncic in Bogi cause Bogi was pretty dominant in Europe too?
Luka Doncic Lukin Deadly so far.

Luka Magic Doncic aka Wonder Boy aka El Fenomeno
"Ben ""Luka Doncic"" Simmons with these FT percentages."
"This series will also expose Ben's deficiency in Offense. A ball-handling guard that can impact the offense in playmaking and scoring is a trend in this year's playoffs:  Utah- Mitchell/Conley  Mavs- Doncic  Hawks- Trae  Bucks- Holiday  Nets- Harden/Kyrie  Suns- Booker/Paul  Nuggets-Playoff Austin Rivers   Clippers, who has wing stars and no star playmaker, had trouble against Luka picking apart their defense and on offense has to rely on Kawhi outplaying in 1 on 1 to get to Game 7."
"The fact that Trae Young and Luka Doncic where on the same draft, and neither of them were 1st or 2nd pick is insane. Crazy talent"
the way you built the team is perfect surrounding trae with high % 3pt shooters with a rim running big. trae has unlimted options. Superstar in the making on par with luka doncic   also helps that you fired pierce
"The fact that Trae Young and Luka Doncic where on the same draft, and neither of them were 1st or 2nd pick is insane. Crazy talent"
"I'm calling that Luka scores most... but still loses. Kawhi and PG both have solid games in the win, and Doncic doesn't get quite enough help to pull off the upset."
"Marcus ""Luka Doncic Jr. "" Morris Sr."
"“America’s Favorite Son, Luka Doncic” - Carl Tart"
Kawhi Leonard and his son Luka Doncic
Luka doncic and his son paul George
He’s also played against Luka Doncic and his son Josh Green.
"The top 5 list is always closer to 7-8 players. I feel like it’s the legit proven superstars in the league with multiple years to have proven nothings a fluke.   Lebron, Harden, Curry, KD, and Kawhi are my top 5 guys with Jokic, Giannis, and Doncic right on the edge. Jokic was the best player this season, but it’s hard not to take in to account the multitude of years we’ve seen those 5 guys lead their teams to the playoffs and win series. I think all three of the guys on “the edge” for me will be top 5 in the coming years especially with Luka and Jokic really proving they can perform in the playoffs these last couple years. It’s just hard to ignore what we’ve seen in the past and it’s why Lebron is still a lot of peoples #1 in the league."
I think a more apt comparison would be comparing Tyler Herro's potential to that of Luka Doncic. Just spitballing tho
"&gt; he’s playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.    Kanter - 40% (2-5)     Lillard - 46% (12-26)      Nurkic - 41% (12-29)       Average - 43% (26-60)       For Kawhi...     Tim Hardaway Jr - 52.9% (9-17)      Maxi Kleber - 75% (3-4)     Luka Doncic - 38% (9-24)       Kristaps Porzingis - 46% (5-11)      Dorian Finney Smith - 17% (1-6)       Average - 38% (27-72)  For Luka...      Reggie Jackson - 67% (6-9)      Rajon Rondo - 17% (1-6)     Paul George - 29% (2-7)    Nicholas Batum - 38% (3-8)     Marcus Morris Sr - 33% (3-9)     Kawhi Leonard - 50% (7-14)       Average - 42% (22-53)       They are all terrific. Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers? I think there's a difference between a team that's 2 wins from 50 versus a team that's 2 wins from 40."
Most 42 win teams don't have Luka Doncic
"Tatum sells a lot of jerseys. He was fifteenth his sophomore year, then 4th for the first half of the 2019-20 season behind Lebron, Giannis, and Steph and in the bubble behind Lebron, Luka, and AD.  His jerseys also sell globally pretty well. From 2018-2019, Tatum was the ninth most popular jersey in Europe, above Doncic who was 14th in sales his rookie year (Doncic’s have skyrocketed since then of course) From 2019 to the start of 2020, he was third in Australia after Lebron and Simmons. This year, he’s tenth in Canada behind Toronto Raptors players, Durant, Curry, Lillard, Giannis, Kawhi, Lebron."
Has anyone name dropped Luka Doncic yet?  *Bang! A bazooka! Step-back like I'm Luka!*
you're completely delusional. Also this is NBA GMs [https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-execs-poll-luka-doncic-top-young-talent-zion-williamson/](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-execs-poll-luka-doncic-top-young-talent-zion-williamson/)  nobody thinks Trae Young is better than Ben Simmons except for Hawks fans but then again Hawks fans also think he's just as good as Luka LOL
100%.  Kawhi was using screens to get Doncic as his primary defender.  Luka was using screens to get Kawhi off of him.  That has to count for something.
"Honestly I think it’s better to not double him so we don’t open everyone else up. Try to contain him the best we can with single coverage.  We can still beat them even if kawhi goes off. If we let everyone else go off then there’s nothing we can do.  Even if our offense is predictable it’s still very effective, we just hit a lot of bricks. Luka had a subpar game too.  Edit: I agree though, we need someone who can get inside outside of doncic"
"Yes, Luka Doncic was the Best player on Real Madrid, a team that won the Euro League."
"Luka has proven himself as the Best player in the Euro League, as the Best player on championship team. Has more team success in a better conference and with similar supporting cast.  The gap between two time 1st All Nba team and zero nba selection is massive.   Just because the media sells narratives and make strange choices from time time doesn't mean that they dont understand basketball. Most certanly they know it better than me and you.  You are quoting some advancend metrics with no context and arguments. Even those favor Luka more. Its one thing to dominate games against Detroit and Bulls, its completely other to do it against Lakers and Clippers.   The Best example for quality are not the stats but the impact that player has over his team and team results. Trae is great but putting him in the same picture as Luka is simple diservice. Doncic is ona trajectory to challenge guys like Jordan and Lebron"
"""nah this the Lakers building technically, we neutral site, you have no power here Luka Doncic"""
"Ah so you think Doncic is already like Lebron James. Ok .  Mavs will never win anything with him in the Harden offense with the ball 99% of the time and 4 role players waiting for catch and shoot passes .  Good for Luka and his stats, bad for actual winning basketball"
Uh it's Lebron James? Well this is Luka Doncic lol
"Tell me you’re mad that you passed up on Luka Doncic, without telling me you’re mad that you passed up on Luka Doncic.  Passing out of double teams and traps isn’t being passive.   Luka is literally always this emotional, he’s toned it down since the regular season."
"Remember Luka had the stamina to run DHOs and it was nearly unstoppable, and now he’s just chilling after he pass the ball like Houston Harden  https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2020/7/20/21330304/the-dribble-handoff-has-been-a-deadly-play-for-luka-doncic-and-the-mavericks"
"doncic is lazy and needs to take his conditioning and fundamentals seriously. if doncic got with a shooting coach and took his form and technique seriously he could become a mid 80% FT shooter and a 40% shooter from 3. if he took his body seriously and got in elite athlete shape instead of carmelo anthony shape he would be so much better as well.   it's insane how naturally skilled Luka Doncic with those problems. he would easily be the best player in the NBA, possibly of all time if he had a better work ethic, or maybe he does have a great work ethic but for some reason is getting bad coaching/development and nobody is telling him to get in better shape or have more consistent fundamentals on his shooting?"

"Saw him waiting for the pass from Doncic a couple of times in the game when he was free on the perimeter. Luka didn't even consider passing to him, gave it to Finney or Hardaway instead."
"If I had to rank them it would be  Luka (I think the Nets are already definitely the best team in the NBA, Durant Doncic Harris Irving Harden would be completely laughable as an offensive lineup)  Harden (The perfect player for the Clippers, an offensive engine that PG and Kawhi can play off of, maybe the best playmaker in the NBA)  Steph (Steph and Giannis seems like a match made in heaven, but I'm not sure its as lethal as the moves listed above. The gravity of the two in tandem would be interesting to watch)  Jokic (Same idea as above, but the Bucks and Steph are both better as a team and individual)  Kawhi (Ramped up version of the championship Raptors)  Dame (Dame is only slightly better than Butler, the 6ers aren't that scary in general in my opinion, Dame would make them title favorites of course, but a pretty clear last place here)"
Too much Doncic. The guy's usage rate maybe an all time high. Its maybe the coach fault that majority of the offense is Luka taking a shot or Luka setting up a team mate. Its hard for an offensive player like Porzingiz to get his offense going in this situation.
No NBA player impacts his own game negatively with bad attitude like Luka Doncic does. He's like Demarcus Cousins.
Been a fun/stressful duel between Kawhi “why tf won’t you miss” Leonard and Luka “how tf did you make that” Doncic
Luka Kennard    Luke Doncic
'Lebron James is a better athlete than Luka Doncic'  Such a surprise.
Kawhi playin like prime Luka doncic rn
"Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Paul George, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Reggie Jackson."
He fucking boomed us   - Luka Doncic
"No one said he played bad in a vacuum.   We’re taking about Luka Doncic here. Not some random mid tier all star. Luka Doncic. The guy who is sometimes touted as a top 5 player, future face of basketball. Yes, you want him taking difficult shots to close a damn elimination game. Yes, you want him to continue taking these shots and not lose confidence in his ability to make these shots."
"Kawhi can't hit every 3. Doncic is a net positive on defense, but he'll have to make some pretty drastic improvements to make some all-defensive teams. I would say 'he can't do it', but Larry Bird did it 3 times, and Luka is more athletic than Bird."
"The Sunday Afternoon Delight: Afternoon of Determination  The swift Los Angeles Clippers have cut through the Pacific seas look to attempt the impossible: make it rain in LA. The Dallas Mavericks have been sturdy and agile, looking eagerly to get their Hollywood Star and advance to the second round.  Kawhi Leonard. Luka Doncic.  Paul George Tim Hardaway Jr  Three pointers! Circus shots, clean dimes. Big time players making big time plays.  A thunderous battle for glory.  Don't miss it."

"Luka Doncic looked pissed as hell. I mean, I'd be too if I got shown up by Kawhi's 45 to my Luka's 29.  Mark Cuban in shambles."
"Don't let this one game make you think Doncic hasn't been the best player this series.  Doncic played scared to shoot this quarter after the no call on the drive, followed by the out of bounds play. It took a career game from Kawhi to beat this team.  Clippers probably pull this out in 7 tbh. Still the more talented team, and if Luka is afraid to waste posessions, that'll be the series."
Reggie Jackson outplayed Luka doncic in an elimination game LOL
Zubac has done well tonight and all he needs is for Luka Doncic to not exist.
Luka fucking Doncic
"I want the Mavs to win but I need this to go to overtime. I took the over on 215 points, the over on Luka 31 points and a Luka triple double. I need 46 more points, 15 points for Doncic and 4 rebounds."
how mavericks feel when other people have the ball while luka doncic is in the game begging for the ball  thats how jazz fans feel when rudy gobert is resting on the bench
"This year really does feel like the changing of the guard in the NBA a little bit, if the Mavs close this out the remaining 8 teams will be led by their stars of:  Donovan Mitchell/Rudy Gobert (never made Finals)  Devin Booker/CP3 (never made Finals)  Nikola Jokic (never made Finals)  Luka Doncic (never made Finals)  Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons (never made Finals)  Giannis (never made Finals)  Trae Young (never made Finals)  and then KD who has won Finals/Harden who's never been  Other than the Nets it's allll fresh blood from a superstars perspective. And same from an organization perspective for the most part. Exciting times!"
Luka doncic
"Luka, Giannis, Doncic, Tatum and Trae"
That was Doncic Luka in the 2nd quarter
Top 5 NBA players of all time:  1. Luke Walton  2. Luke Kennard  3. Luc Longley  4. Luka Doncic  5. Luke Ridnour
Flaming hot take.  Luka Doncic is good at sport
Reggie Jackson vs Luka Doncic just like we all expected
Reggie Jackson vs Luka Doncic  what a trash performance so far -_-
Luka Doncic vs Reggie Jackson
I took the over on Luka 31 points and the over on 215 points + Doncic triple double. So I should be good on 2/3.
Luka “James Harden” Doncic
"Expecting luka to become a ghost in a 7 game playoff series, with a big chance to win the whole west is like the least luka doncic thing ever. Im betting against that"

"Gotta love the good old ""Big market = good"" narrative I have seen multiple times  Get the fuck outa here, love me some Luka ""Michael Jordan"" Doncic  Ty"
I’m from Eastern Europe. We don’t nickname players here lol. He’s just known as “Luka” and sometimes they even call him “Doncic”
Luka doncic or Alex Caruso? Who would you take? Delete this post
"Steph Curry, Ja Morant, and Luka Doncic.  I love playing with players that pass the ball and create opportunities for their teammates.  In my humble opinion, these are some of the best to do it in today's game."
Luka Doncic is only good because Adam Silver is trying to spread white supremacy propaganda
"Luka Doncic is getting $8,049,360  He’s one of *the best players in the league* and he’s getting less than $10M  Nothing more valuable than a phenom on a rookie contract"
"ha damn it I thought I linked out the [article](https://www.warmthebench.com/luka-doncic-free-throws/), my bad!  Luka's at 42.9% from 3 and from the line this series, while in the playoffs Steph shoots 40.1% from 3 and Shaq's at 50% from the line."
Luka Doncic is one of the best young players in the league! The Mavericks should build around him to win a championship.
"&gt;Haralabos Voulgaris is without a contract beyond the end of the current season with the Dallas Mavericks and his role with the franchise has been scrutinized following a report in The Athletic and the departure of Donnie Nelson.  &gt;""If they're going to bring in a real president of basketball operations, whatever the title is, they're going to hire a real person, Bob Voulgaris can't be there. There's no one who is going to accept him in the middle of all this. To me, I think that's going to be a non-starter for anyone of any real stature in the league.  &gt;""I think Cuban realizes that. I think Bob Voulgaris realizes this. And the other thing is, there are other frayed relationships with Voulgaris within the organization. Obviously the Luka [Doncic] one... Mark Cuban will have a really strong analytics department. Bob Voulgaris, I can't imagine the circumstance where he'll be in charge of that."""
&gt;I still don't have a full understanding of NBA financials and the salary caps but even though the salary cap does limit larger markets from getting all the superstars it also limits smaller markets as well does it not? Wouldn't richer teams still just pay the luxury tax for the superstars if there is no limit to how much they could pay them? I know that the nba does some type of sharing of revenue between teams so maybe that balances things out. Would no max still give richer teams the best players even if there is a salary cap? Also if you removed a max contract wouldn't that remove a player's incentive to stay with their drafted team or the team that own's their bird rights? Players like Luka Doncic and Zion Williamson really would have no reason to stay in Dallas and New Orleans right because the Knicks would have the Cap Space and the money to sign them and pay them the most amount of money that smaller markets might not want to reach? Even if the knicks went over the cap and went into luxury it would still be worth it for them if they win titles because they can easily make that money back. I know this wouldn't happen all the time but could it still happen a lot? I know teams like the knicks are profitable just for being in a large market. They can make money even without years of having no superstar and I know it's a lot harder for smaller market teams to make a profit. Sorry if most of this is incorrect but this stuff gets confusing. I would like to know if this is not the case.
"Presti is just going to hoard up all lottery picks until nobody can be able to draft good young players, so they will be left with all aging vets while OKC has the next Luka Doncic"
Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Ja Morant  Lamelo Ball  De'Aaron Fox
"what input? the teams been trash for a decade and they lucked into Luka doncic, if they didn’t have luka they’d still be pure ass."
Well you all decided Marvin Bagley was the best player available when * checks notes * Trae Young and Luka Doncic were both left on the board
Presti been playing the long con. He's gonna trades all these 1sts for Luka.   Luka Doncic traded to OKC for the entire 2028 draft class.
"I agree he is much better defensively , but Trae’s overall playmaking ability is still huge to build an offense around.  You wouldn’t say Tatum is better than Doncic even tho Tatum is a better defender tho. (I understand Trae isn’t Luka tho, just illustrating a point). Again it’s very close to me who I’d want between Trae and Tatum, I don’t think it’s clear cut like you do"
"I'm really not looking to the common sense here. We were hit by a sequence of punches, the franchise is now in disarray and we are basically one ""Luka Doncic to the Lakers?"" rumor of being put on suicide watch. Having Dirk involved, even if he suggests us to hire Joachim Low as the new HC, is better than the speculation of Excel Bob being hired permanently."
"Haupt, Max  MVP Voting:   Curry, Stephen (GSW)   Doncic, Luka (DAL)   Westbrook, Russell (WAS)   Simmons, Ben (PHI)   Antetokounmpo, Giannis (MIL)"
"This is brilliant by Presti not just bc of the obvious plethora of picks, but bc he’s on pace to do what most tanking rock bottom teams havent: limit how long they have been terrible.  Much of this is due to CP3 miraculously having OKC good last year. The other part is Shai being so good. Bc of those 2 things, it’s very possible this past year will be the only year OKC is a sub 30 win team. So you have all those picks, mortgage sale, and still field a good squad. Compare that to the process Sixers they were rock bottom for lile 5 years.   Also it helps that the league is so young and young players come in ready.   But just imagine OKC gets 2 top 5 picks. Let’s say Evan Moboey and Jalen Green.   Kemba - Shai- Jalen Green- Mobley  I mean Luka Doncic is 22 and a 2-time all first team nba guy. It’s a young man’s league it wouldn’t surprise me at all if OKC is a 35 win team"
"Luka is apparently running guys out of town.  His talent is otherworldly but that attitude would've clashed really bad in Phoenix.  People roll their eyes at fit but Ayton is 1000% a better fit in Phoenix and because of that they don't need Luka. They already have a superstar wing, if Ayton can become an All-Star center (well on his way) they won't miss Doncic"

"no like unders on say luka doncic being under 30pts. then double tech him before he gets to 30. that's just one example, there's plenty of other ways refs can influence games in favour of certain outcomes   it might not be a high paying bet but combine it with some other things and syndicated with bets in the 000's of thousands or millions and you're talking big money over the course of a season"
"Nope, I want to see Luka Doncic running over hookers in a Faggio"
"Doncic, with all due respect to his obvious talent, is an elitist diva who is going to tear Dallas up over the years in full Lebron-esque fashion.   Only, he doesnt play winning basketball like Lebron, he plays Harden ball.   &amp;#x200B;  this could work for the Mavs, they get him some actual support and not just good G leaguers (sorry Brunson, Cauley-Stein, Kleber, Finney-Smith, and basically everyone else except Powell and barely Porzingis)   &amp;#x200B;  or it could lead to Luka whining his way around for the next 10 years and being bounced in 2 v 7 matchups each year, screaming for free throws he wasnt fouled for and all the other shit out of James Harden's book"
"No state income tax and Luka Doncic, are still two good selling points lol"
"hes got the body, just some platforms and a little camera work and boom 6'8 Jonah ""Luka Doncic"" Hill"
This motherfucker thought Kobe was bad? And now he is going to be in charge of Luka fucking Doncic? Fucking end me. He thinks Millsap was undervalued and not Kobe? WTF he probably is going to give the team to KP now or some stupid shit.
The Mavericks have Luka Doncic one of the best talents to enter the league and they can’t get their shit together for the kid to put the franchise into the stratosphere.
A team with Luka Doncic is the furthest thing from the titanic I can imagine.
Takes all of that damn time just to shoot like Ben Simmons or Luka Doncic at the line
"Luka Doncic invited his old friend  Rick Carlisle for dinner at his mansion, a seven-bedroom spread in the woods of suburban Ft. Worth that did not feel particularly lived in. This was the night before the two-time defending-1st round exit Mavs played the coaching carousel on network television, and Doncic was battling the flu. That didn’t stop the wine from flowing, because Luka was a gracious host — Matthew McConaughey planned to stop by when he was in town — and nothing could stop Luka from getting what he wanted, which was to move the hell out."
"Secret mavs employee here, we'd like to trade luka doncic for ben simmons. That is our organizational imperative"
Luka Doncic has entered the chat
 Luka Essien Doncic
"&gt;Before Luka Doncic was drafted, reporter Gambadoro heard from multiple sources that he was 'very immature', 'Not liked by teammates', and 'full of himself'.  Maybe this reporter is full of himself?  Literally no one in the NBA hates Luka. He's like the golden fucking child lol."
"yeah, it’s too bad the superstar turned into a donkey instead of the advertised unicorn… and the second guy turned into a generational talent, franchise player. oh and this surprise with Luka Doncic was mostly with US folks; ppl in Europe knew he was special before the draft even happened"
&gt;	you have a generational talent to work with  Bold to assume Luka Doncic is gonna wanna stay after all the staff turnover…
"&gt;by what metric   See my comments above where I posted several rankings showing the Hawks and Mavs rankings coming into this season.  &gt;why is their season better   One of the teams is one game away from the conference finals against the 1 seed while the other took a first round exit.   &gt;but you just spill shit as facts that aren’t facts  I posted my sources. Everything else is clearly my opinion.  You’re literally fucking sperging out and have no idea what you’re even talking about. My ENTIRE point was responding to a comment that said “If you put Trae Young on the Mavs and Luka Doncic on the Hawks, the Mavs get worse and the Hawks get better. It’s a fact”   You’re having an autistic spitfest behind your keyboard and don’t even know what conversation you jumped into."
"It would be sick if Luka doesn't re-sign next season, then signs with the knicks, then the knicks get the the Doncic-less Mavs pick in 2023."
trae young &gt; luka doncic
"Holy shit. That's one of the GOAT coaches right there, wow. I figured we would know well in advance, but i imagine he and Doncic clash philosophically (best way to use Luka goes against the way Carlisle seems to enjoy coaching), then the KP situation on top of that.   Dude's too accomplished to let a player do all the playcalling while fans start claiming he, of all fucking people, doesn't know how to utilize a 7-foot stretch big."
"Luka, ""coach Killa"" doncic"
"we have seen them play well together. Remember last years playoffs, KP played so well its fair to say he contested Doncic for the teams best player (although in the end, clearly Luka is the best).   Porzingis has been a shell of himself nearly the entire season. He was injured, got rhythm, was injured again, and so on. I dont doubt that he has the skills to be an effective player. Body is the biggest question mark and I think if he is healthy and fit (he could use some more strength) then he can work on synergy with Luka to be a dominating duo. But to say they dont match together after just this rollercoaster of a season is really reactionary"
"&gt; Doncic showed up Carlisle several times this season, such as making animated gestures on the court when he disagreed with a decision or yelling at Carlisle in front of assistant coaches and teammates.  Wonder if the Mavs fans who shit on Rondo will have a similar kind of energy here.  Luka needs to chill, he's not quite where he thinks he is. He's a poor FT shooter, streaky shooter (considering how he started the season), poor defender with no lateral quickness considering his size and evidently has some attitude issues."
"Trust me, this guy is a good coach! He can even be as good as Rick Carlisle!  ~Luka Doncic probably"
Yeah and that's on the Mavs not Doncic. You think people would worry about having to appease him if he wasn't in such a terrible situation? It was the same with LeBron's first stint in Cleveland. The notion that Luka/LeBron is/was at fault for Mavs/Cavs is ridiculous.
"There's no I in team, but there's an I in win  - Luka Doncic"
"I never said Luka is holding his team back? What the fuck are you on?   It’s hilarious watching you guys argue the guy who averages more assists and has crazy highlight reel of dimes would make the Mavs worse while also arguing that Luka is what makes them better.   The entire league clearly believed Doncic had the better supporting cast coming into this season. Why is Doncics playmaking what makes the Mavs good an acceptable argument but Trae Young putting up better assist numbers on a unanimously agreed upon significantly worse team not an acceptable argument?   The hypocrisy is astounding and you literally had to make up a scenario where I say something ridiculous like Luka Doncic is holding his team back, which couldn’t be further from the truth, to even have an argument."
"I'll get downvoted for this but, Harden isn't the talent Doncic is. And, Luka has already had more iconic playoff performances. You can't afford to let Luka go, no matter what."
You want Luka Walton as coach.  But you might end up with your star player becoming Luke Doncic.
"I mean, this decision making process &amp; thinking brought to you by the organization that thought it was a good idea to take Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic, Trae Young or JJJ and the organization that thought it was best to lose Bogdanovic for nothing because they needed more minutes for Buddy Hield &amp; Cory Joseph.  If they made good decisions they wouldn't be the Kings"
It's a Sicilian message. It means Luka Doncic requested Rick Carlisle sleeps with the fishes.
"Really a locker room cancer, And an empty stats kinda guy, Luka “despite the series lost” Doncic.  Tbh I don’t have anything against Luka but boy is it fun seeing the Luka stans baffled by Trae’s play. since they clearly didn’t watch hawks games before.  Hawks won the trade"
"Wow....this shit is insane. I guess the Mavs really are a mess behind the scenes because wow, imagine leaving a job with Luka fucking Doncic as the star. He was a guy i didn't think was leaving his team ever. He's gonna be the most coveted name on the market by far tho. And now the Luka sweepstakes might soon start."
"That was interesting.    He named Jason Kidd from 10 years ago, but not back to back All NBA player Luka Doncic."
Because they traded away Luka Doncic.
"&gt; This is false. Dallas made two lottery picks - DSJ and Luka. Hawks selected Trae, Reddish, Hunter, Okongwu all in the top 10.  Maybe that was because you traded one of your lottery picks (who ended up being Cam Reddish, the entire subject of this post) to us to actually get Doncic? What kind of logic is this..."
"Yes, but objectively Luka Doncic is a 1st team all-NBA player. Whether or not you think other players didn’t deserve that award is irrelevant. No one can argue Doncic isn’t first team all NBA, unless it’s because of homerism."
lol what? We have had one year were we got a top 5 pick from the draft lottery. 2018.  In 2019 we traded up to 4.  We got Picks 8 and 10 from the actual lottery  &amp;#x200B;  * 2016: Bembry at 21  Rebuild Starts here  * 2017: Collins at 19 * 2018: Doncic at 3 who we traded for Trae at 5 and a 1st rounder the following year * 2019: Hunter at 4 (traded up from 8 by using another 1st rounder) and Reddish at 10 (part of Luka-Trae trade) * 2020: OO at 6  * 2021: Pick 20  So again fuck you on about a bunch of high lottery picks.  We had 3 years of losing after completely blowing up our roster(seriously Collins is our longest tenured player and it's 4th year). We had 1 top 5 lottery pick we actually won (the Sixers had 5 in the past decade).  We had to trade for the other top 5 pick we used.  Please find me a team that has completely imploded their roster and rebuilt on a shorter time scale.
"Trae doesnt have to have 30/8 by halftime for the Hawks to be within 10   &gt; Mavs would still not have secondary playmakers that can create their own shot at even the level of Bogdan just because Trae gets there.  This does mean that Luka had to carry more offensive load and couldnt play off ball (to whom?)  &gt; Mavs big men wouldnt magicaly become able to rim protect and rebound if trae is there  This does mean that Mavs did give points easier than The Hawks so they had to cover an even bigger ground offensively to stay in the game and that certainly that difference between teams wouldnt change if you swap doncic and Trae. Actualy Mavs become an even worse defensive and rebounding team then so the load the superstar would have to carry offensively for them to stay in the game would get even higher  So of course Luka is much more gassed come 4th quarter cause  there is no players around him to relegate shot creation, ball handling and playmaking and cause AND he had to do these stuff at a very high rate and play after play cause of a worse defensive and rebounding team around him, especially at the 5.  Put Trae on the Mavs. Who does he give the ball to that can dribble, pass and run sets for him to go and play off ball like he does now in some plays?    Also yesterday they won specificaly because the other team's stars choked their asses off while kawai was playing like a god every last quarter. Have Kawai and PG shit the bed this much at any of the last 2-3 games and Mavs win"
&gt;he was swapped with Luka Doncic and nobody thinks too much of it.   &gt;nobody thinks too much of it.
"Well   1. It wouldn’t have been the number 1 pick. According to you Suns should have flipped their picks in Bookers second season, which means it wouldn’t have been the number 1 overall as Ayton wasn’t drafted til Bookers 4 year. (That’s what being an idiot and flipping picks early gets you)  2. Again a second star would have come at the cost of both Chris Paul and Ayton.  3. If you honestly think that having a pick where you can choose between Luka Doncic, Trae Young or Ayton should be traded for some random dude who might leave a 2-3 later then you are insane."
"It’s not even up for debate who is better, it’s clearly Luka  28,8,8 vs 25,3,9  The only thing he’s better than Luka at statistically is assists which is probably because he has a better team. I’m taking Doncic over Trae any day and anybody who isn’t is either a Hawks fan or has insane recently bias"
"&gt; Interesting that the Mavs were a bunch of scrubs even though they shot near 50% from 3 those first couple games and shot 38% for the series. Meanwhile Trae's teammates are bricking wide open 3s and shooting 35% for the series.  Shooting isnt everything and even there through the playoffs its a wash, both shot around 37-38%% without Trae/Luka. Mavs legit dont have bigs that can rebound or rim protect or lob run or PnR on a good level. These are MUST haves next to players like Luka and Trae and the Hawks have such players.   Its not the fault of Luka that Porzingis regressed in defense after last year (look at every advanced stat even during his good shooting regular season) or cant rebound for shit and cant roll to save his life . And that no big men can in teh Mavs. Powel pre Achilles was a great roller and the Luka-Power PnR was literally the most efficient offensive play in the league so its not like Luka doesnt run amazing PnR sets when he has people to. Swap just Porzingis (who is supposed to be Mav's second best player) with Capela or Collins and the Mavs win the Clippers series.   Also the Mavs literally have no player on the roster that can playmake, create their own shot and put the ball on the floor safely at the level that Bogdanovic or Huerter. Its not ""Luka ball hogs so they dont have the chance to"". There was a whole season of any of them getting chances to find out but no one has the skills to take offensive load of Luka and run plays. You can ask yourself if a team would you trade the 2-4 best players in the Hawks for even the 2-6 best players in the Mavs ?   Hawks FO straight up outperformed the Mavs one and even then with a single small upgrade of KP with a big that can rim protect and run PnR we wouldnt be having this convo cause Mavs would have beaten a similarly good team to the Sixters.  &gt; Trae for some reason didn't get the benefit of the doubt when he was putting up 30/10 with 2 rookies, Jabari, and Damian Jones in the starting lineup last year.  People shouldnt have, i agree here  &gt; Doncic is a generational talent because why? What makes him a generational talent and Trae not a generational talent?  I believe that both are generetional in a way but i do believe that Luka is both better rn and has a larger potential.The gap between them isnt huge and Most aspects slightly or more noticably favor Luka besides freethrow shooting only thing i give Trae a smallish edge is playmaking.. Most playmaking and passing metrics through their career and playoffs are similar with Trae slightly better. And when Luka played with a bigs that could roll well they were closer. In the playoffs scoring stats increase in Luka's favor and playmaking increase in Trae's (small sample size). And also as an extension most advanced stats do favor luka  some slightly and some by more and i do think the vast vast majority of GMs, Coatches,FO  etc rn would pick Luka starting next year"
Does anyone genuinely think Luka Doncic or Nikola Jokic are attractive?
" Ok this is what I'm talking about. All of these reasons are just thrown out here as if Trae has no accomplishments of his own because people have already decided that Luka is the far better player due to the media and their unconscious bias.    Did I forget how Luka is 1st all NBA? No, i also didn't forget how Trae wasn't voted to the all-star game. Both ""awards"" are voted on by the media where all NBA is actually completely voted on by the media lmao.    &gt; remember how luka got first team all-nba, and pushed a team of scrubs (minus hardaway jr maybe) to seven games with the clippers?    Interesting that the Mavs were a bunch of scrubs even though they shot near 50% from 3 those first couple games and shot 38% for the series. Meanwhile Trae's teammates are bricking wide open 3s and shooting 35% for the series. Trae for some reason didn't get the benefit of the doubt when he was putting up 30/10 with 2 rookies, Jabari, and Damian Jones in the starting lineup last year.     Doncic is a generational talent because why? What makes him a generational talent and Trae not a generational talent?     Is it because he's bigger? Is it because he was great right away and Trae looked like a bust for half his rookie season before he became a great player? Is it because Luka has a more aesthetically pleasing game?    The answer is yes to all of these. Your unconscious mind tells you that Luka is better due to all these factors, yet when you look at the stats ... They put out essentially the same output. The media tells you Luka is better and your mind confirms it from watching a few games."
&gt; Lmao what “rumors” are saying Luka’s going to demand a trade?  https://theathletic.com/2649806/2021/06/14/inside-the-mavericks-front-office-mark-cubans-shadow-gm-is-causing-a-rift-with-luka-doncic/  The one that just caused you to fire your GM lol.
"umm? i feel like there is some recency bias because trae is cooking rn but do you remember how luka got first team all-nba, and pushed a team of scrubs (minus hardaway jr maybe) to seven games with the clippers? i think that trae is a star no doubt, and maybe has an MVP season in him at some point but doncic is a generational talent, he just has a much shittier roster lmao"
I don't think he's actually that underrated when he was swapped with Luka Doncic and nobody thinks too much of it. These two will dominate the league for years to come.
"Unless something drastic happens in terms of getting the right pieces around him to become a perennial contender, it really does seem that Luka ain't retiring in Dallas. He's the type of euro player who will probably move at some point while still in his prime, if not before. And before Mavs fans storm in denying it all, nothing indicates he is super excited to be a Maverick for life, or at least until past his prime. Regardless of how PR ready he is, his remarks and gestures lately look different compared to when he was in Madrid.. and to his first 2 seasons with the Mavs. What I do know about him from his time in Real Trampas Mandril (that's an insult, I'm a Barça fan) is that he's all about winning. And he won't be ok with putting up historic numbers just to fall short or not be good enough as a team. He hates losing to the point that I envision him doing whatever it takes to pile-up rings. And yes, if the Knicks are able to prove they can build a contender, that's where I seem him heading if he were to leave Dallas. But again, Marc Cuban has the chance to do things the right way and collect many rings.. but make no mistake, Doncic is no Dirk; if he needs to walk he'll walk."
"If Luka Doncic had no hands, would he be in the NBA?"
"While this trade does seem like a win-win it's hard for me to call this the most win-win ever, for it to be a win-win you almost have to think about how would Dallas be with Trae Young and Cam Reddish and how would Atlanta be with Luka Doncic. If both teams are worse then yes it is a win-win trade however I think Atlanta gets better and Dallas gets worse. I know Trae Young is really hot right now and is having a great playoffs and is leading his team incredibly right now but if I'm Atlanta and Dallas offered me Luka straight up for Trae Young and Cam Reddish that's an instant accept"
Is it just me or is this luka doncic guy pretty good at basketball??
Luka Doncic and Larry Bird comparisons name a better duo
"Moritz Wagner &gt; Luka Doncic     Germany will win, and Luka fanboys will cry."
"The only thing he ""learned"" was that his teammate is luka doncic and if the team is desperate as fuck then Luka should shoot the three. Look at THJs catch and shoot % with the knicks - its amazing. We just sucked and genuinely needed him to take heat checks every game. Thats what killed his efficiency. I dont think black hole is fair to him on the knicks. Who else was gonna shoot?"
"for Ben Simmons we just want Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Zion Williamson, Ben Simmons and 5 first rounders from the Timberwolves."
"Aight aight , ill lower the draft ask.. just give us Luka Doncic even swap"
"Ah okay, thanks for correcting me, trying to figure out the Olympic tournament has got my head spinning.  Even so though, if you go off of FIBA rankings the US would either play #2/#10 or #3/#16.  If Luka Doncic didn't look so dominant losing would still be the more strategic decision.  Yeah it'd be an impressive tank job but that's my point, with more games there'd be less chance of an intentionally poor effort being rewarded."
"“You guys have Luka Doncic maybe at his peak and you can’t even get to the western conference finals???  Lmao what a garbage org”  (I’m not saying this is true, I’m just saying expect this response.  It doesn’t matter if you actually put together a great defensive team or ran into a Magic team with a surprisingly modern offense or played against the Pistons or Drew Gooden left even when he said he wouldn’t or you ran into the Tim Duncan Spurs.  you should have won with that player who will probably be a top 15 player all time!)"
Vlade Kings. Luka Doncic
All of this to lose to Luka Doncic
"As a disclaimer, this isn’t meant to detract from Luka’s blocks per game or op’s post. I just personally like to know (might just be a me problem) about ties when there are statistical rankings given and in this case, I was aware of it since I remember hearing Tatum was tied for 1st in blocks per game while playing 8 and 9 fewer minutes than the guys he was tied with (which appear to be Doncic and Hamed Haddadi from Iran). Still crazy that Luka is tied for first especially with everything else he’s doing."
"Nobody would ever phrase it like that. They would say ""Luka Doncic Resigns With The Mavericks for $xxx Million"" and it would be blatantly obvious that he is signing a new contract with the Mavericks.  If you really, truly get confused by that then I question your grasp of the English language. If someone really, truly posts something like ""Luka is resigning"" with no further context, then I will do my part in downvoting them just like I expect everyone else to."
I can’t believe nobody is talking about how Luka Doncic is good at basketball.
"Luka ""Shaq Diesel"" Doncic"
"Definitely watch some historical clips over the years to watch how the game started and has developed. I personally recommend starting around the 80s and watching some highlights of the Celtics and Lakers match-ups, especially their finals match-ups. Detroit in the late '80s brought an overwhelming defensive presence to the game which changed things up a bit. Then of course you have to watch the greatness that was Michael Jordan in the 90s, the double three-peat.   After that you'll be caught up to the 2000s where things are a lot more current and familiar. Assuming you don't know but the Lakers (Shaq and Kobe) and San Antonio Spurs were the powerhouse teams in the early 2000s, followed by a power move by the Celtics in 08 to form ""the first"" ""Big Three."" I personally believe this move  by the Celtics is what has powered a lot of the motivation behind free agency/trades over the last decade plus. Around that same time was the rise of LeBron James, widely regarded as the second-best player (or best, depending who you are talking to) to Michael Jordan. LeBron James' move to the Miami Heat started his Finals dominance the last decade which was very entertaining to watch as he showed up in the Finals nine out of ten years from 2011-2020 with the Heat, Cavaliers, and now Lakers.   The Golden State Warriors rose as a titan in 2015 and began their reign, with Steph Curry greatly evolving the game by extending the expectations of 3 point shooting. Kevin Durant, regarded as the current second-best player to LeBron James in the NBA, joined the Warriors in 2016 and formed what was known as the ""Hampton Five"" - which was arguably the best line-up in the history of the NBA. Kevin Durant left the Warriors after 2019 for the Nets, which brings us to today's game (upcoming year) where there has been somewhat of a vacuum left by the Warriors from the last decade, in which several teams are in-contention (including the Warriors, I think) for the upcoming years to establish a new dynasty.   James Harden's trade from the Rockets to the Nets was regarded as the largest move last year and many expect Brooklyn to take home the championship in the next 1-2 years. It is a great time to get in the game as there are many young players on several teams who are still blossoming as the leaders of their franchises and are expected to join the ranks of the elite like Trae Young on the Hawks, Zion Williams on the Pelicans, and now you could say Cade Cunningham on the Pistons - while we are still watching the rise of other potential all-time greats like Giannis on the Bucks, Joel Embiid on the Sixers, and Luka Doncic on the Mavericks.  Great time to get into the sport and hope you enjoy it!"

No love for Luka Doncic?
"In no particular order:  1.	⁠Giannis  Arguably the best player in the world today and he’s only 26. Unless he becomes riddled with injuries, it’s very unlikely we see him drop off in the next 5 years  2. Luka Doncic  Luka will be 27 and in the prime of his career. He’s already found his way into some MVP conversations at 22 and it’s not hard to imagine he’ll win the award sometime in the next 5 years.  3. Zion Williamson  The man is already averaging 27ppg in his first full season. I can easily see him improving over the next few years to become a top 5 player in the league  4. Donovan Mitchell  At 24 years old, Donovan Mitchell is already among the best guards in the league. When you look at Dame and Curry, and you compare their games from when they were 30yrs old to when they 24/25yrs old, you can see they improved a ton and really took their game to the next level. Who’s to say Donovan Mitchell won’t do the same.  5. Deandre Ayton  This ones a reach, I know, but it’s kind of boring if I make my list too safe. Don’t really have a good reason for why this would happen lol, but here’s my hot take: Booker and Ayton will start to get Kobe &amp; Shaq comparisons 5 years from now  Additional notes:  I could’ve put “someone who hasn’t been drafted yet” because there’s a great chance another Derrick rose or Luka doncic comes into the league (especially in this 2021 draft class), but I wanted to keep it to players in the league rn."
"&gt;Lowry has long been intrigued with joining Heat star Jimmy Butler and the Miami organization, and now Miami has maneuvered to have two key elements of a possible sign-and-trade package -- guard Goran Dragic and forward Precious Achiuwa -- to offer the Raptors once talks can ensue at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, sources said.  &gt;The Heat picked up the option on Dragic's $19.4 million contract for the 2021-2022 season, making him an ideal contractual fit to include in talks to make a deal possible with the Raptors. A market exists for the Raptors to move Dragic, 35, onto a new team, including the Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans, sources said.  &gt;Achiuwa, a well-regarded 2020 first-round pick out of the University of Memphis, showed significant promise in his rookie season and would serve as a sweetener to Toronto to facilitate a sign-and-trade deal, sources said. Miami could add draft assets to a package, too.  &gt;Dragic has been a longtime mentor to Mavericks star Luka Doncic, both natives of Slovenia. They also share an agent, Bill Duffy of BDA Sports. The Raptors have Fred Van Vleet returning at point guard, and drafted playmaker Scottie Barnes out of Florida State with the No. 4 pick in Thursday's NBA draft.  Some form of a 3 team deal looks most likely."
[I_Said_Joe_Mama] Sources indicate Luka Doncic and Jayson Tatum may team up in Sacramento down the line  Am I doing this right?
Look into Dallas. Dirk was a loyal legend and now they have Luka Doncic. He is going to end up being one of the GOAT
"If Luka Doncic has a couple more great seasons, I bet he could too."
"Last time I played in China, the people at the park were most interested in knocking your ass to the ground (think Raja Bell and Pat Bev types). They play hard, for sure, but that's basically channeled into fouls. Playing good help defense and recovering to your man after getting screened is non-existent because you can just deck someone to stop a possession. Can't get embarrassed by a crossover or blow by if you don't even get a shot up.  The basketball culture is just every man for himself, dribble 18 times like Harden and T-Mac before him (Rockets are the #1 team in China, at least pre-Morey controversy) and put up a Kobe-esque fadeaway. There is no AAU, and there's no youth level teams like Real Madrid/Barcelona to farm talent a la Ricky Rubio and Luka Doncic. It's a shame because there are kids out there with hops but are just so undisciplined that they would get benched immediately for dumb fouls/poor shot selections if they played overseas.  And yes, I'm a Rockets fan for exactly this reason and I modeled my game after Kobe/T-Mac."
"NBA is focus on individuals. Just like in music, TV and entertainment in general, marketing will focus on individuals, not the team.  An average basketball fan will not be able to name a player on championship Bucks' team, but if you say Lebron, it will immediately spark their attention.   Secondly, NBA figured long time ago that scoring a lot of points attracts fans who are still on the fences or have little or not interest in the sport. For the past 20+ years they've been enforcing rules that favor offensive players: banned hand-checking, defensive 3-second rule, and allowed James Harden to perfect the game of foul-baiting - all with a goal to discourage defense from getting too close to the scorers. In his rookie year, Luka Doncic famously said it's easier to score in NBA than it is in EuroLeague. He's absolutely right!  FIBA (EuroLeague) basketball is not focused on generating billions for their owners and players. The game is focused on a team play, and the rules are made to protect the purity of the game. Hence why they don't hesitate giving out technicals for flopping and if the dribbler forces a contact, they won't blow the whistle. That's how the basketball was meant to be played.  For us older folks, today's basketball is a lot different than what we played as kids and teenagers in college and playgrounds. If you pulled the Harden shenanigans  and called for a foul, you'd be laughed at and kicked off the court. In NBA, that's called prime-time basketball."
"Luka Doncic by quarter this playoffs:  1Q: 85 PTS, 54 FG%, 48 3P%  2Q: 71 PTS, 62 FG%, 57 3P%  3Q: 54 PTS, 44 FG%, 32 3P%  4Q: 40 PTS, 35 FG%, 28 3P%  He choked when it mattered."

They don't have a Luka Doncic covering up these weaknesses though
"Yeah I think he's a good player you know what this is you see it all the time people dont like advanced metrics or impact metrics because they dont understand them or just feel like its some arbitrary black box way of analyzing things. So they break down stats and players in ways they can conceptualize them. Comparing two players TS% is easy to conceptualize so it makes it seem like its more important than it is. Same thing when people do things like look at unadjusted plus minus, use playtype data, or weigh individual things they perceive as important way too heavily. Because those are the terms under which they view the game and conceptualize it.   There was someone on here who wrote a 42 page scribd paper about why Trae Young is as good as Luka Doncic. It was full of analytics and metrics. The whole thing was asinine and nobody who works with nba data and analytics for a living would ever support any of the methodology(or the conclusion). But it was basically him taking all the individual stats he could find and that he could understand as important and say ""Hey look they are the same or Doncic is behind Trae"" and the ones that have Doncic ahead he would just add caveats like ""Well impact metrics are notoriously flawed and cant account for many things"".   It's just a general trap people fall into all the time on here. And it highlights anti analytics vs analytics is all just a strawman everybody uses data and numbers even Charles Barkley. We just use what we are comfortable with can conceptualize and grew up looking at"
If you told me Luka only had 12 I’d have thought Slovenia would have lost by 20.  Great game by the rest of the team when Spain completely sold out to stop Doncic
"I want all 😂 yes, probably Luka Doncic will win but I want to dream till the end"
So what you’re saying is this Luka Doncic fellow might be good?
"They almost lost against Ricky Rubio and Spain. You think THJ, KP, Brunson can’t replicate Rubios offense?? Remember Rubio can’t even shoot the ball and he was cooking Luka Doncic. All you classy fans don’t understand basketball a lick."
Luka ”near triple double” Doncic strikes once again. He could easily had 15 assist.
"The rankings are skewed though, Slovenia hasn't even played any international competitions since 2017 (if Doncic or Dragic don't play qualifiers, we don't qualify). This team, as it is now, obviously deserves a better rank than that. When Luka doesn't join the NT though, they're only a shadow of their current self. He really elevates the whole team mentally and makes them play twice as good as otherwise."
Luka Doncic is **16-0** with the Slovenian national team.
"We are so close to see another Luka ""Luka 'Triple Double' Doncic"" Doncic."
"Luka ""Draymond 'Triple Single' Green"" Doncic so far."
"Okay, lemme explain why Spain doesn't have any chances against Slovenia:  Their best players are role player Ricky Rubio, who's their first scoring option which says alot, aged Pau and Marc who are already too old for this shit, Willy Hermanboobiez, whose defense is non-existent and Rudy Fernandez, who was out of NBA after 4 years. And worst of all they all don't fit each other, they defense is ok, but offense sucks too much, if your first option is Ricky Rubio.(Only scored 88 against Japan and 81 against Argentine).  Meanwhile Slovenia has MVP candidate Luka Doncic, who ain't even at his prime yet, and Vlatko Cancar, who's better offensive player than Rubio. Rest of the players are elite shooters who fit with Luka well, even more than in Dallas. They scored 118 against Argentine and 116 against Japan which says a lot about their offensive power. But their defense is so-so.  So it's basically Slovenia's offense vs Spain's defense. If Spain clamp Luka hard, they'll leave open their shooters, and if they'll have 1v1 defense, Luka will feast on ISOing.  IMO final score will be 102:90 in favour to Slovenia."
Luka Doncic
Luka Doncic
That was the exact premise for the [article] (https://www.warmthebench.com/luka-doncic-free-throws/) I wrote that discovered this odd data point!
47 points on 22 shots!!!! That’s insane. For reference doncic just had 42 on 37 shots. And that’s not even a shot at luka. Book was just absolutely wild tonight.
Either jazz or whoever coming out of the clippers mavs. Mavs are a little sus but Luka doncic is just too fucking good
Can't wait to watch Suns-Nuggets featuring rising superstars. Not to mention if the Clippers lose we get to watch Luka Doncic... another rising(or already) superstar
Mark my words. There will be no LA teams in the second round of the NBA playoffs. LUKA DONCIC IS HERE TO GET THE JOB DONE.
"We have entered a new era of NBA superstars.  Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Devin Booker, and Jokic will all dominate the next era and battle each other for titles.  And damn.. never thought I’d see the day Lebron gets bounced in the first round. Pretty Surreal."
Luka Doncic has entered the chat
Luka motherfuckin Doncic
"Trae Young averaged 9.4 FT attempts on 18.8 shots per 36 this year.   Doncic had 7.5 FT attempts on 21.5 shots per 36.   Lillard had 7.3 FT attempts on 20.0 shots per 36.   I see people sometimes complain about Trae (not as much as Harden. Have to use last year stats for Harden 11.6 FT attempts on 22 shots per 36 in 2019-2020).  I rarely hear people complain about Lillard.  The closest comparison to Doncic this season is De’Aron Fox who shot 7.4 FTs on 19.6 shots per 36   To summarize. Only Trae Young is even close this year to Harden last year in free throw rate. And even then Harden is pretty far ahead of the field.   Luka sits in the middle of a group of players that I would say are well liked by this subreddit (Beal, Fox, Lillard, Curry, Morant).   Maybe people dislike Harden more because he gets more FTA than everyone else? Nah it’s probably a race thing.   Edit: also I can’t find stats on 3 point fouls drawn but as of a 2019 article by NBC Sports the league average for drawing a foul on a 3 pointer is 1.6 percent and Harden averaged 11.5 percent."
"Luka ""Baby Bron"" Doncic"
"Harden has a longer tenure in the NBA and has faced a lot more trouble in the playoffs, since he played more years than Luka, being way more scrutinized than Luka for his failures to get a title, while Luka is still liked because he is a young star, and his failures can be tied to not having yet the most competitive team to fight at the highest level for a title. And if he starts talking about leaving Dallas, then it will come hard.  As soon as Doncic starts to get into his prime or the Mavs starts getting more competitive, the hatred will show."

"Quick rundown of every team in the league:  Boston Celtics: a corp of young players, exciting to watch, however aren’t quite good enough to make noise in the playoffs yet. In the past they have been one of the most dominant teams in sports history winning 17 titles, tied with the Lakers for first. Very storied franchise with a passionate fanbase.  New York Knicks: one of the wealthiest franchises but are a joke as they tend to have a history of disappointment and missing out on big free agent signings. They make it into the playoffs every 5-10 years and are always fun to watch when they’re good. Large and passionate fanbase.  Brooklyn Nets: went from being a joke and a backwater in New Jersey to being one of the wealthiest and most renowned franchises in a matter of a decade. They have a super team built around three all stars and are heavy favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference and possibly win the title. Tends to have a lot of fair weather fans.  Philadelphia 76ers: another storied franchise with some of the NBA’s greatest players ever. After a fairly successful rebuild they are a playoff staple and are currently the highest seeded team in the Eastern Conference.  Washington Wizards: a fairly mediocre team that’s pretty fun to watch. They are going to have to start rebuilding soon I’d say.  Charlotte Hornets: an up and coming team that had previously been an absolute dumpster fire of a franchise. They have young talent galore and are on pace to becoming the NBA’s next big thing.  Atlanta Hawks: formerly a fairly mediocre team that made the playoffs but never actually did much. The Hawks get better every year and are in a position to make a deep playoff push and maybe even contend with the other big East teams.  Orlando Magic: a franchise tht always lands good players in the draft, but always loses them to bigger markets. Entering a total rebuild at the moment.  Miami Heat: a solid franchise that was infamous for its super team in the early 2010s. They made a surprise run to the finals last year but this is mostly due to the conditions of that season. Young and old talent alike and a decently fun team to watch.   Cleveland Cavaliers: a miserable franchise that has only ever been relevant because of LeBron James. Right now they are amongst the worst teams in the league as per usual.   Detroit Pistons: feared in the late ‘80s for their physical play and again in the early 2000s for their finals run, the Pistons, just like Detroit, are a far cry from their glory days. In the middle of a big rebuild.  Indiana Pacers: best summary of this franchise, bad luck. The pacers always put up decent teams for the most part and have a solid history but always are good in a time where the Eastern Conference is fierce with competition.  Chicago Bulls: internationally one of the NBA’s most famous teams. Michael Jordan, the best player of all time played here. Watching the last dance must have given you a decent amount of information about the Bulls. Since that 1997-98 season however, the Bulls have never even touched any semblance of their former glory (except maybe with Derrick Rose in the early 2010s, which was a basketball tragedy). A decent roster that just doesn’t perform how they should on paper.  Milwaukee Bucks: overall a fairly good franchise and in the modern day one of the East’s top teams. They are a favorite to take the Eastern Conference, I highly recommend keeping up with their series versus the Nets it’s shaping up to be a good one.  Toronto Raptors: The only NBA team not located in the U.S. A fairly new but good franchise that recently just won its first title. They are at a crossroads and are most likely looking to rebuild.  Memphis Grizzlies: have always been kind of irrelevant, but have put together solid teams. They have a young corp of players that can be built upon. They may be a Western Conference playoffs staple in the near future.  New Orleans Pelicans: similar to the Grizzlies and Hornets, with the exception of an arguably even better roster than either of those teams, but with less postseason success. They’re still trying to find their rhythm but it is quite possible that they could be contending for a title in the future.  Minnesota Timberwolves: the t-wolves in my opinion might be the most frustratingly disappointing franchise in North American sports. High draft picks seemingly all the time, but are just terrible year in and year out. They’ve had like five rebuilds in the last decade. Wasting premium talent is Minnesota’s specialty. However they might change this narrative soon, maybe.  Houston Rockets: formerly (as in literally two years ago) were a formidable team and the second best in the Western Conference (after my team, the hated Warriors). They had a solid run that was exciting to watch. It all came crashing down at the beginning of this season when their superstar James Harden demanded a trade. Houston is one of the better franchises in the NBA but they are about to enter a dark age.  Oklahoma City Thunder: the Thunder for the past decade have been a playoff staple and filled with young talent. This reputation is looking to continue. They’ve hit a rough patch but they own the most draft picks in the next 5 years than any team in the league. This team is very soon going to be overflowing with the nation’s top young talent.  Dallas Mavericks: a well-operated and storied franchise with a young superstar in Slovenia’s Luka Doncic, who may be a future MVP. With some small improvements to the roster or the addition of a second option, I could see this team making a finals run very soon.  San Antonio Spurs: a great franchise that built a 20 year long dynasty. Very well-liked by most other fanbases in the league. Currently in a rebuild right now but it may not be that far away until they see the playoffs again.  Denver Nuggets: one of the Western Conference’s top teams. They are consistent and have been a solid team for the past 5ish years. They are a dark horse finals candidate this year.  Utah Jazz: The top seeded team in the Western Conference and owners of the NBA’s best record this season. They have a solid franchise and a loyal fanbase for such a small market team. Talked about a lot in the Last Dance as they were the team the Bulls beat in their championship.   Phoenix Suns: Another one of the NBA’s top seeded teams. For a long time the Suns were a backwater in the NBA that rarely made the playoffs. Many of the NBA’s best players have spent time in Phoenix. Have a legitimate chance for the first time since the 90s to make the finals and win.   Portland Trail Blazers: a small market team with a die hard fanbase and solid history. A playoff competitor for most of the decade. Kind of hard to hate this team. However they’re just never good enough to seriously contend for a title.  Sacramento Kings: a small market team that has been the definition of pain and suffering for the past 15 years. Haven’t built a good team since the mid-2000s. Always have to compete for attention in a crowded California market but despite all this have a good fanbase.  Los Angeles Clippers: the second rate Los Angeles team that everyone likes to make fun of. They’ve had some good teams recently but they never get it done in the playoffs and always lose to a team they should’ve beat. History is looking to repeat itself this season.  Los Angeles Lakers: perhaps the NBA’s most storied and well known franchise. The largest fanbase of any basketball team in the world. Their also extremely shallow, arguably one of the worst fanbases in the league out of California. They most recently won the finals but their on thin ice and probably won’t repeat. Tied with the Celtics for most championships with 17, however I would argue the Lakers have a better overall history. I will not apologize to Boston fans for that.  Golden State Warriors: my favorite team and one of the more hated teams in the league. A great history with some of the NBA’s top players. A large fanbase in Northern California and plenty of bandwagons outside of that area. Stephen Curry, basketball’s greatest shooter is the focal point of the team. Injuries have hampered this team recently as the dynasty begins to dismantle after a 5 year era of unrivaled  dominance.  That’s basically a small rundown of every team in the league that will undoubtedly piss everyone  off."
"You talk about potential as if most of these guys aren't already better than Tatum. Tatum's slight uptick in passing efficiency hasn't even gotten him close to any of the guys I've mentioned in terms of passing/playmaking. In terms of scoring Tatum is great and up there with the guys I mentioned, but he isn't going to become a better passer in the next 5 years than any of these guys are now unless CP3 possesses him. Doncic has plateaud statwise, but his game has shown improvement with the introduction of the midrange and post game making him an even more robust scorer come playoffs. Where has Tatum shown that type of growth in his playmaking? Tatum is about the same level as Paul George as a number 1 option right now in their careers, but PG has shown a higher peak being an MVP candidate in OKC.   Clearly you rate Tatum very high, but you're comparing him with players of similar age who are already Top 15 or even Top 5 in case of Jokic and Giannis. He would have to show something that he has never done to even become better than Luka is now by learning how to pass/playmake at an elite level. Idk how you can say other young guards in the league outside of Luka have shown the same ceiling as Young when he is already putting up monstrous scoring and assist stats whilst being the sole focus of the defence. I'm not gonna bother arguing with you if you think Tatum has the potential to become a top 10 passer in the league or that he has the potential defensive impact of a Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green. Because those are the only ways he even comes close Jokic, Giannis, Luka or leapfrogs Young and Zion in terms of potential value. He's a great player and a perennial all-star/all-nba, but he isn't a future MVP candidate unless he does something he hasn't even shown glimpses of."
"Ok but I’m not arguing who is putting up monster stats now it’s still about potential. It doesn’t make any sense how you don’t recognize that Tatum has both become better at playmaking and more efficient each year as his AST/TO ratio has Improved along with his assists going up. Meanwhile Doncic and Young have both plateau’d statwise this year, there isn’t much either of them can add to their offensive games other then strength and intelligence (free throws for Luka) or efficiency.  As for Zion yes he is an athletic freak but you can’t say you see his potential for shooting and defense which have both been extremely hit or miss and then ignore Tatum’s growth as a playmaker.  Tatum is already a better scorer then George at this point and arguably a better all around player so I’m not sure how that could be his ceiling. Tatum is already a two way All-NBA player who as you admit has loads of room to grow. What more can Trae Young add to his arsenal on offense at this point other then being more consistent and maybe keeping his teammates more engaged? I’m not sure how you don’t list Tatum on that list yet have Young when there are arguably 2-3 other young point guards who have the same “ceiling” as him."
"Yes, but there's other players that despite their scoring ability being worse than KD they know how to manipulate offenses and control the tempo of the game that might be more valuable. So in a sense THOSE players might be more of a defensive nightmare. Like prime Lebron, Luka Doncic, Jokic, etc."
League sources: Luka Doncic to command rookie max extension
"DeAndre Ayton is not worth the same money as Luka Doncic or Trae Young, sorry. He's performing well against a garbage Lakers front-court. In reality his offense is abysmal and his defense/rebounding is marginally above average.  Joel Embiid has offense. KAT has offense. Ayton is not even close."
"&gt; He loves that pasta, is what I heard. Mans is overloading on carbs, that's all.  It turns out I am also Luka Doncic."

"Luka ""a lot of things"" Doncic"
"I think that's my favorite part. It's like he takes it personally when PG and Kawhi aren't the ones he's getting buckets on. Luka ""Don't Switch"" Doncic."
"Pat Beverley, defensive specialist, who allegedly defended 7 footer KD well, cannot see floor time due to Doncic. Its a massive statement by Luka!"
"Luka Doncic demanded 8 points out of Kristaps Porzingis before Game 5: “Typically, we play Fornite, if we’re playing at home. We’ll play in the morning, after shootaround. I told him, I need 8 out of you and we’re gonna get this dub.”"
"If you make millions after just a few years...Never?  Certainly nothing beyond summer homes come to mind for Euro players in this situation.   I’ve seen all the Jokic videos discussing how bland the food here is.  That said if you score a franchise player like Luka, and your boss is a billionaire, it’s hard to imagine Doncic hating on Texas three years from now. He’ll have citizenship soon enough because the Mavericks/Cuban will NEVER let him leave.  Mark my words, Doncic and his hot Mom will have southern accents when alls said and done."
Except we know that Dorian Finney-Smith is not the one driving Dallas’ success. He shares the court with Luka Doncic most of the time. We know that Damian Lillard has for the most part been a god this series
Two words Mr. Silver:  Luka  Doncic
"I think the key to making a good show is for the hosts to just not take themselves too seriously. You don't need to provide cutting-edge basketball commentary (most fans won't even understand the technicalities). Just make wild predictions, joke at each other's expense, and you will entertain. Skip Bayless and Stephen A have perfected this and they get paid $25 million a year to scream about whether Luka Doncic is *actually clutch*."
"It’s very close. I don’t think there’s a consensus best player in the league right now but these guys are both in the conversation. I’ll take Luka for health reasons.  But seriously, watch out for Doncic in years to come. That guy will terrorize the whole league."
"The reverse happened to the Mavs and Luka though.  The Suns drafted Ayton, Kings drafted Bagley, Hawks picked Doncic and then traded him.  Even the savviest of professionals mis-draft.  So looking back at this guys take, which is wildly wrong, we should keep that in mind that the job is hard."

"Luka Doncic, from Slovenia, a country in Europe, where the predominant favorite sport is soccer, where also Luka has incredibly high support, where fans frequently throw banana peels and do monkey chants to traveling black athletes in their country and region? You cant see there being ANY crossover here?"
"&gt; I’m optimistic about the Mavs’ chances, but let’s be honest; this was an ugly ugly win, and in the two games before that anyone not named “Luka Doncic” just couldn’t shoot.   Just commenting to say this is some grammar &amp; syntax porn right here. Correct use of a plural possessive apostrophe AND a semicolon correctly joining two independent clauses? Mercy."
