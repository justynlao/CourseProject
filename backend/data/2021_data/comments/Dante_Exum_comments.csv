"The Nets obtained James Harden and gave away Caris LeVert, Jarret Allen, Rodion Kurucs and Taurean Prince, their umprotected first round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, plus a first round pick swap (so if the pick of the other team is lower that that of the Nets they trade those picks) in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.  The Cavaliers obtained Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince and gave away Milwaukee's umprotected first round pick in 2022 and Dante Exum.  The Pacers obtained Caris LeVert and a 2nd round pick in 2023 from Houston and gave away Victor Oladipo.  The Rockets obtained Victor Oladipo, Rodion Kurucs, Dante Exum, the Nets 3 umprotected first round picks, Milwaukee's 1st round pick (via Cleveland), the Nets 4 1st round pick swaps and gave away James Harden and a 2023 2nd round pick."
"So just because we have Drummond we shouldn’t have traded a bucks 1st and Dante exum for Allen? Dudes 22 and our future center, Drummond will be gone"

"Utah's only top five picks in the past several years were Enes Kanter and Dante Exum, neither of which worked out for us, lmao.  I fear top 10 picks now."
Yeah it was! but without drafting dante exum instead of marcus smart. I dont know if we make the trade for jordan clarkson. so counter factuals fucking suck.
I mean yeah that’s the difference in getting a bench warmer or a guy who could be in the rotation.   It wasn’t going to get a guy who would drastically let Utah make a significant leap but it’d be the difference between like a Jordan Clarkson and a Dante Exum
Dante Exum. But poor guy is made of glass.
"It's funny because Ingles WAS brought in to do just that! Haha.  Ofc it helped that he could play, but let's be honest, Joe Ingles never makes a Jazz roster if Dante Exum isn't drafted by them at #5 in 2014."
"Think of it this way.   When Utah acquired Ingles, Dante Exum was looking forward to a season where he'd play 82 games &amp; he'd also never been injured.  .... feel like a long time ago now?"
"We traded Exum &amp; 2 2nd rounders IIRC.   I still love Dante, but that trade made us so much better."
"I still don't understand it lol  Jarrett Allen + Prince for Dante Exum, Milwaukee pick &amp; a second round."
Dante Exum and a late first
Dante Exum and the Bucks 2022 1st round pick
And Prince for the shell of Dante exum  and late first rounder I'll never understand
"The Cavs worming their way into the Harden trade is lowkey a brilliant move. Snagged a good big in Allen and a serviceable wing in Prince for the low, low price of Dante Exum and a pick."
We really traded Dante Exum and the Bucks' first round pick for this dude lmaooo
Yeah most journeyman players aren’t that involved in the national narrative. You don’t see Dennis Schroeder or Dante Exum involving themselves in these situations either lol
"I still think about it every day that the Jazz finessed Clarkson for Dante Exum. I know Cleveland wanted more minutes for guys like Garland, Sexton, and Porter, but holy shit the value he brings to Utah is tremendous."
"Very happy we walked away with Smart at 6, where he's surrounded by Noah Vonleh, Dante Exum and Elfrid Payton"
Getting Jarrett Allen (and Taurean Prince) for Dante Exum and a Bucks 1st was absolute fucking robbery by the Cavs.
The bucks first next year iirc and dante exum
dante exum and a 1st 🥴
"It is notable that people naturally link players due to appearance (looks, skin tone, etc.) RJ Hampton looks like Dante Exum so he got that comparison a lot."
I’m confused by this.  What was in it for the Nets to give him up.  The Rockets gave him and Prince away for Dante Exum so it doesn’t seem like they really valued him anyway .  Wasn’t there something or someone else the Nets could’ve offered?
HODL Dante Exum Island 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Guys dante exum has all star potential have you seen his first step?
"Dante Exum, if only because of 2k15 MyCareer"
There's a tiny little part of me that still thinks Dante Exum is for sure going to blossom one of these days...
Mudiay and Dante Exum... I still believe!
Dante Exum
"He's like Dante Exum, but good."
Yeah I mean Dante Exum literally just got traded
Homie been hanging with Dante Exum
Has he been hanging with Dante Exum?
I understand why they're doing this but I don't want to watch Tyrese Maxey vs Dante Exum.   Sorry.
&gt;Dante Exum is injured  Of course he is
"Dante Exum is injured, watch him fail the physical and the deal gets called off"
Allen's due for an extension though. I think at first glance it's apparent that Houston has no interest in paying him so they swapped him for Dante Exum and will shed another ~8M in salary since he's an expiring.   I get what you're saying about better ways to save money though; if Oladipo does get moved though I'm wondering how they're going to go about it.
Michael Kidd Gilchrist is younger than both of them by at least nine months. Also Dante Exum is only 25 somehow.
"&gt; you get 6’8 point guard/forwards who can also shoot once a decade. Lebron, Lamelo, Luka  Lebron was a below-average at best shooter for years (29% as a rookie, 33% in his 1st CLE stint). Luka still isn't a good 3pt shooter (31.8% career, 27.3% this year). Neither is Lamelo so far (32.7%).   Frankly, that's all pretty comparable to Dante Exum (31.4% as a rookie). Maybe they'll develop into good shooters like Lebron or say, Greivis Vasquez (29% rookie, 39% prime), maybe not.   You don't see many tall PGs in general, and the ones we've seen certainly weren't/aren't good shooters entering the league."
I guess this is how I’d cope too if my team traded a perennial MVP candidate for an expiring Oladipo and Dante Exum
Dante Exum was a failed version of Lonzo Ball before Lonzo Ball was a failed version of Lamelo Ball
"The Rudy getting the league shutdown thing followed by the supposed fracture between he and Donovan could have been a funny thing to explore.  Could have Rudy been like the mountain being revived or something like that but then he's just off and turns out it gets everyone sick. Then Donovan goes full Ramsey Bolton mode during the rift and he captures Dante exum or Grayson Allen or some guy no longer on the team and ""tortures"" them. I dunno just spitballing some funny sounding shit."
"I understand that those two aren't great, but if you're the Nets for example you are in desperate need of another center and you have limited assets available.  Jarrett Allen isn't going anywhere though; Cavs got a great deal swapping Dante Exum for Allen. Drummond will either get traded or walk in FA so Allen can get the bag."
Add Dante Exum to the list
"Yup, Bucks 1st and Dante Exum"
Cavs somehow turned Dante Exum into Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince. Gotta give it to them.
"How is that any different than Anthony Bennett, Jarrett Culver, Mo Bamba, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Alex Len, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, or Thomas Robinson being set up to fail, or failed by their teams?"
"The Pacers and Cavs absolutely fleeced everybody man  You trade an injury-prone expiring contract back from a major injury for a young talent with All-Star quality. Huge W. And Cavs get Jarret Allen and Prince by giving away Dante Exum and a 2nd round pick is also a W,but a little smaller because they have Drummond and McGee already."

"Oh damn, Dante Exum is not good, I must be thinking about someone else. You're right, not that great of a trade.   Guess Fertitta really said fuck Daryl Morey if they really were offering Ben Simmons and took this instead."
"We’re getting more dudes with big boy appetites, he may have to bring extra  I’m so hyped for this though, from a basketball standpoint. In a vacuum we gave up Dante Exum, a bench player who never stuck and that we didn’t need, and a first round pick for *Jarrett Allen* and Taurean Prince. It’ll be a lot of sharing the paint, but good luck getting to the rim on us"
Building around Dante Exum
"Not really , Allen essentially offers the same rebounding skills with better rim protection and comes at a lower price tag . Drummond is a free agent after this year and will want a max deal. Cleveland won’t give him that (Drummond does not fit with what the NBA has turned into - it’s a shooters league).   Cavs just turned Dante Exum into Allen ( one of the best young centers in the league) and Taurean Prince who’s a decent bench player. They can move Drummond now for draft capital or other young pieces to go along side the core group of Sexton, Garland, Allen , and Porter Jr. (if he ever comes back).   This was a great move by Cleveland"
"""The Rockets will receive four first-round picks and four-pick swaps, all unprotected.

"Rockets still get Oladipo, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, Four first round picks and four pick swaps. Pretty good end result for them."
"The Nets sent Houston a package that includes multiple players and draft picks and features guard Caris LeVert, who was then traded to the Pacers for Victor Oladipo, sources tell ESPN.  Center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince are headed from the Nets to the Cavs in the deal, according to sources, while the Rockets receive Cleveland guard Dante Exum and Brooklyn forward Rodions Kurucs  Houston also receives Brooklyn's three unprotected first-round draft picks -- 2022, 2024 and 2026 -- in the deal, plus pick swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027, according to sources. The Rockets also get Cleveland's 2022 first-round pick, via the Milwaukee Bucks.  Wow"
Dante Exum reaching his final form of salary fodder for trades
So the Cavs really gave up the perpetually injured Dante Exum and a late first for Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince? Completely fleeced em
"I'm not sure if this is complete, but from what I gather:  To Brooklyn:  * James Harden (obviously)  To Houston:  * Dante Exum * Victor Oladipo * Rodions Kurucs for some reason * Two 2022 firsts, a 2024 first and a 2026 first  To Cleveland:  * Jarrett Allen * Taurean Prince  To Indy:  * Caris LeVert"
Also gave up injured bust Dante Exum
you guys got jarrett allen for...dante exum and a first or two?  ....thats it?

Did the Cavs just give up Dante Exum and a first for Allen and Prince? Thats a pretty solid deal for them.
Why didnt Rockets just take Allen instead of fucking Dante Exum??
"The Rockets will receive four first-round picks and four pick swaps, all of which will come from the Nets except for a 2022 Milwaukee pick currently owned by Cleveland.

"I don't understand Allen getting traded to the Cavs. I figured he'd be more valuable to keep than the Bucks 2022 first rounder, unless Dante Exum is that good which I don't know. Seems like they could've kept Allen"

"Cavs traded an utterly shite contract in Dante Exum and ended up with Jarrett Allen, lol."
I'm really mad that Cleveland just got Jarret Allen and only gave up Dante Exum and a future first. Hornets could've really used a big like Allen.

"Jfc I typed in Dante Exum and the first thing under people always ask was ""is Dante Exum hurt?""."
"That's what they said about Dante Exum... Dude has played 239 games in 6 seasons and is out right now with another ""freak injury"". At some point you're just injury prone."
"&gt;  I really still believe in Dante  Give it up. Exum is horrible. And that's when he's healthy. He's never healthy, which makes him even more of a liability."
And we got him for Dante Exum. I really still believe in Dante but it was clear JC fit the team better since we had a bench starved for scoring
"Dante Exum - 100% on the Exum train when he got drafted. But as it turns out, he's a guard that can't score, or be a playmaker and has been mediocre at best throughout his 7 years in the league.. lots of things went wrong in his short career. He's now 25.. and I wonder if this is it for his career. Not sure how many more chances he's going to get from NBA teams."
Dante Exum
Joe Johnson was so washed he did not even play much and Dante Exum was always injured. People have such a bad memory. It was just a few years ago.
"Does this sound like a lottery team to you?  Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles, Ricky Rubio, Jae Crowder, Dante Exum, Derrick Favors, Rodney Hood, Joe Johnson.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html)"
If he were to stay in Australia he likely wouldn’t have played pro at 16/17. What Lamelo did is not normal. Most Aussie hoopers with NBA dreams look to go to college in America. And they usually attend the AIS up until they make college like Dante Exum did.   So the two main pathways are either what Bogut or Exum did.   So no if he stayed in Australia he wouldn’t have played pro.

Dante Exum: the answer is always the IR
Dante Exum. The guy has an insane first step and I really thought he could be a top 15 combo guard in the NBA. I still do honestly lol.
Trae was in fire till he came across the buzzsaw Dante Exum
Dante Exum
Let's hope he's not Dante Exum 2.0
"hes done pack it up, dante exum 2.0 inc"
At this point the only thing I remember Dante Exum for is his acting in NBA 2K15
"Raul is an excellent third PG and a decent backup, plays hard and doesn't make mistakes. My main gripe with him was that he just couldn't stay healthy. A backup that can't consistently be available loses a lot of his value, especially if you already have Dante Exum in your roster lol"
The Cavs must be kicking themselves letting Clarkson go for Dante Exum and a measly second rounder.
I would like to give the game thread its once-per-game reminder that we traded Dante Exum and got Clarkson.
They really got Jarrett Allen and Taurean prince for Dante Exum. Unbelievable
"Yea its just odd. Look at how Dennis treated players like Joe Johnson, Dante Exum, and Derrick Favors where he chose to trust/reward them or trade them in ways that didn't really benefit the Jazz because he respected them as people. He's always had a reputation of being respectful and high character. He's also actively provided a platform through the Jazz organization for players to engage in activism for what they were passionate about. He's trusted by high character people like Quin Snyder and Donovan Mitchell. This is why its so confusing.    Obviously, if its true, no fucking way should he stay in charge. Our players don't deserve that shit."
So glad we passed up on Jarrett Allen so we could grab Dante Exum.
In another timeline Dante Exum and Donovan Mitchell are wrecking backcourts all over the NBA
He's trending to follow on the Dante Exum path right now.
Give me Dante Exum. Suppose to be the next Penny Hardaway
"The hype that the 2014 draft class had is finally starting to show. Now we gotta get Wiggins, Jabari, Aaron Gordon and Dante Exum to the all star game"
Dante Exum and random injuries is the GOAT for this
"Hey at least you’ve got the corpse of Dante Exum and a (nominally, since it’s the Bucks’) first-round pick"
"We coulda had him, but thought turning him and Prince into an injured Dante Exum and the 27th overall pick (at best) was a better idea.  And Rockets Twitter still vehemently defends this decision because ""we don't want to have to pay Allen and he doesn't fit next to Wood.""  Give me a fuckin break."
"The Cavs picked up Allen and Taurean Prince for the corpse of Dante Exum and Milwaukee’s 2022 1st. Neither of those are assets I’d lose any sleep over wasting. Obviously I hope we keep Allen around, he’s a great young player, but I think he’s limited enough as a player that he’s not gonna get the max.   He’s a good defender, rebounder, and rim protector, but he’s skinny enough to get bullied by larger 5’s and not quite quick enough on the perimeter to be comfortable switching. Offensively he can catch lobs and sometimes hit an open midrange jumper, but he’s extremely limited on that end. If he can add some muscle and mass for screens and the low block, he could have a broke man’s Gobert kind of impact, but he’s not nearly there yet."
"dante exum, joe ingles, can you believe how solid jazz is before"
"Yeah for the Cavs, Dante Exum up next 😤"
Jordan Clarkson for Dante Exum and two second round picks is lowkey one of the best trades in the last few years
For Dante “Mr. Glass” Exum no less
"I'm always worried today will be the day that we struggle because Jordan isn't hitting his shots, but then he hits an and one three fading into the corner off an out of bounds play and I wonder how we traded Dante Exum for him."
Dante Exum
"Jazz fans and Dante Exum, i never purchased real-estate on Exum Island thank goodness."
We traded Dante Exum for Clarkson. Think about that.
Jazz have tanked like twice since relocating to Utah. It netted us Enes Kanter and Dante Exum.  2/10 Would not recommend. . .
Honestly I think Dante Exum is the fastest player in nba history
"And I think that he’s loyal because Utah took a chance on him when others wouldn’t. The Clippers waived him, and he wasn’t about to get signed by anyone else until the Jazz signed him (just to make lottery draft pick and future superstar Dante Exum feel more comfortable by giving him a countryman in the locker room)."
Dante Exum has the best name in the NBA yet he's not good.
Tim Frazier and Dante Exum are both irrelevant. And don’t post advertisements.
"fr, him and Dante Exum competing for the worst luck right now"
Dude has been slowed down by the likes of Lu Dort and Dante Exum but the best defensive guard in history isn't going to have some success? Lmao
"Dante Exum.  Dude had every tool in the toolbox to be an incredible player, but never managed to put it together, or stay healthy."
"Dante Exum.  I feel so bad for that guy, injury took him out so early on."
Dante exum
Dante Exum syndrome
"I’d say so. He’s definitely been more disappointing than guys like Fultz, Sebastian Telfair, Wiggins, OJ Mayo, Greg Oden, Dante Exum, Kwame Brown, Thomas Robinson, Derrick Williams, and Jabari Parker"
Idk bro I was a big Wiggins fan when he came out of Kansas but even in Kansas he didn’t look that that great but he was super athletic  I watched some wolves games to check him out and he’s like the opposite of ant  Ant goes out there and is super aggressive and Wiggins could go 5+ minutes without touching the ball and he’d be chillin in the corner then he’d get the ball and do some ugly mid range iso  Even when butler was there he didn’t look that great I thought with butler and KAT they’d be a top 4 seed. Wiggins and Dante Exum were the 2 from back then I really liked but turned out not that great
"Between 2012 and 2017, the international (no college) players drafted in the lottery were:  Dante Exum Dario Saric Kristaps Porzingis Mario Hezonja Emmanuel Mudiay Dragan Bender Thon Maker Giorgios Papagiannis Frank Ntilkina  There's a good reason why teams are hesitant to draft international players with high picks. There are definitely gems out there, but it's much more difficult to evaluate talent playing in unfamiliar circumstances."
Clarkson for Dante Exum and a second round pick was a pretty massive win for us
I meant by 6th man 6th option not Trez that is on bench and then goes in after 3 mins and plays 30 mins last year Zubac 'starting center was playing something like 18 mins and rest went to Trez. Griffin is pf he is there to play instead of KD and with in small ball line ups. He will have 50% fg cause he will not tank like in Detroit and also based on Blakes last playoff he can be decent. And plenty players in range 8 to 14 are not better than Griffin would you have Dante Exum for 8m or Griffin or at same position 8m Bjelica even Galinari 20m he literally cant move on defense? I mean we will see but im sure that Blake at Jerred Dudley contract is steal
Dante Exum  Rodionos Kurucs  Poka  Anzejs Pasecniks  Goga Bitzade
Dante Exum. I held on to hope for so long.
"Let’s see the picks that surrounded them. Tatum was chosen over the consensus first overall pick Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Jackson.   Jaylen was drafted over Dragan Bender and Kriss Dunn.   Marcus Smart was drafted next to Nik Stauskas, Noah Vonleh, Dante Exum, and Jabari Bird.  At what point are we gonna dispel the idea that just because you are drafting high means that the pick is going to work out. It’s absolutely crazy to not reward GM’s for making the correct pick, even high in the draft.   Jayson is the best player out of everybody in his draft class. Jaylen is the best player in his as well (I personally think he’s better than Simmons because Simmons can just get schemed out in the playoffs and has been in the past).   I seriously don’t know why people use this as an argument."
"i was very very wrong about dante exum, i thought he would become an mvp caliber player   i was however very very right about jaylen"
"I think my favorite part of the Dante Exum saga was Dennis Lindsey holding out on a Conley trade because Memphis wanted Exum included  Like, I get it, but also...it's Dante Exum lol"
We traded Dante Exum for him if that tells you anything
Dante Exum
Dante Exum
"sorry no data,   um so basically it goes:  -no interest in basketball all my life till University  - starts playing pick up with friends at uni  - buys 2k15 or 16 or whichever had the cutscene with Danté Exum  - Ask friend who knows ball if Dante and the Jazz are good, he says he doesnt know Dante but Hayward is pretty good.  - Watch that Hayward team for a bit as my interest in ball grows  and thats that really, just stuck with em, never really LIKED a played on the raps, like i like Lowry now, but back then the only interesting player to me was DeMar and i didnt care about those casts, now im diehard jazz 4L"
I wanted Dante Exum over Embiid lol.
I was going to support whoever drafted Dante Exum since he was a fellow Aussie and was getting some attention
"Sure he wasn't the best back then, but surely he had to better than someone like Dante Exum? Lmao"
Dante Exum perhaps
And we got him for Dante friccin Exum
"The other guards with E are: Wayne Ellington and Dante Exum, and Ellington are already listed"
I swear he plays like himself then 3 games later he turns into Dante Exum
Dante Exum.  It ends this year but he got 3 years 33 million for no justifiable reason. Wouldn't surprise me if he is out of the league after this season.
"Iron man Dante Exum, duh"
And didn’t they basically bring him in because he was passable enough as a third stringer to be an Australian friend for Dante Exum? How the turn tables
1. Dante Exum
Who would have thought those Dante Exum predraft comps would be so eerily accurate.
Or Dante Exum!!!
Or Dante exum
"&gt;He was the consensus number one pick the entire year until his foot injury  This is true, but after the injury he was no longer a no brainer. I just googled ""nba mock draft 2014"" and found on the first page of results three mock drafts that had the Sixers taking someone else and Embiid falling lower than three. [Here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2099551-2014-nba-mock-draft-jonathan-wassermans-final-2-round-predictions)'s one where the Sixers take Dante Exum, [another](https://nbadraftroom.com/p/2014-nba-mock-draft/) with Exum, and [one](http://www.basketballinsiders.com/2014-nba-mock-draft-final-consensus/) with a combination of guys all not picking Embiid."
"This season, eight Australian-born players have played an NBA game.  - Ben Simmons  - Patty Mills  - Will Magnay  - Kyrie Irving  - Joe Ingles  - Josh Green  - Dante Exum  - Matthew Dellavedova  Irving does not represent Australia internationally, whereas Aron Baynes (born in New Zealand) and Matisse Thybulle (born in the US) do.  Ryan Broekhoff, Jonah Bolden, Mitch Creek and Isaac Humphries are all playing overseas but have spent time on NBA rosters in recent seasons. Josh Giddey is also a projected first round pick in this coming draft. I’m not sure where the number four comes from?"
"That was not the opinion at the time. Jayson Tatum was the prize and the Celtics had Jaylen Brown too. Especially since Julius Randle left in free agency and was not on the team Lebron joined.  But there were many other teams. For example the Suns, who had Devin Booker and Josh Jackson. The Jazz with Donovan Mitchell and Dante Exum. The Sixers with Simmons and Fultz. Heck he could have gone to the Timberwolves and flipped KAT for Ad."
You get Kelly onlynk Avery Bradley Dante exum 4 1st and 4 pick swaps
Remember when the clippers handed him to the jazz and the jazz basically took him to be a big brother to Dante Exum?
"at no point was randle really a bust, id say he turned his career up* not around  i remember being upset ending up with randle instead of a guy like dante exum"
"Bro, exactly. I got back into basketball partially from playing 2k11 with my brother. I was always the bench mob Bulls but I only played Brewer or Korver at SG pre-rip. Brewer at least had his defense, Bogans the Ultimate Irrelevant. Honorable Mentions- Dante Exum, Thabo Sefolosha, Jeremy Lamb, Andrea Bargani"
Wiggins vs Parker the other night. Now Wiggins vs Embiid! Where’s Dante Exum?
Bro if you just read Reddit reactions you're gonna think every lower leg injury is an Achilles.  * [Dante Exum injury](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kqm4d8/highlight_dante_exum_goes_down_with_a_noncontact/gi4krnx/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) - actually a calf strain * [Marcus Smart injury](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/l93mrc/highlight_marcus_smart_injury_vs_lakers/glfzb85/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) - actually a calf strain * [Goran Dragic injury in the bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/j30dc2/highlight_goran_dragic_injury/g78xxvs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) - actually a plantar fascia tear
Dante Exum did great on him in between injuries in 2018
They forced me to play my 10-day in 2K15 with the Jazz and Dante Exum bullied me.
"Top 10 defensive win shares for 2020-21  Spencer Dinwiddie  Henry Ellenson  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert  LeBron James  Julius Randle  Elijah Bryant  Dante Exum  Ben Simmons  RJ Barrett  This is your voting list for all-defensive teams, correct?"
The two controversies that season: Replacing Kanter with Gobert and Trey Burke with Dante Exum in the starting lineup! Haha
"Dante Exum and Trey Burke aren't even included!  It was Kanter, Favors, Hayward and Alec Burks that was supposed to be the future star unit for the Jazz. Lol. Crazy how none of these guys ended up being the future, instead it was a late first round pick and a late lottery pick in 2017 after their supposed ""star"" in Hayward left in FA !"
That along with Dante Exum as the starting PG! I don't want flashbacks to that time.....
We tanked one season and it got us Dante Exum. Then the Jazz decided that shit wasn't for us lol
Dante Exum in shambles
Dante Exum?
He’s not better than Clint or embiid or Dante exum so thanks for the funny jokes man you’re doing great work
no ty corbin means no dante exum and therefore no jordan clarkson but i know what you mean.
What? Corbin wasn’t a great tank commander. They only really tanked one year under him and ended up with the 5th pick and Dante never plays exum
"To piggyback off this, Australia (if all their players show) has a really solid rotation. Ben Simmons, Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Matisse Thybulle, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Baynes, and Dante Exum is a solid group of NBA players. They also have other notables like Mitch Creek, Ryan Broekhoff, Thon Maker."
Dante Exum with intangibles 😔
I genuinely thought Dante Exum would be the next big thing and easily one of the two best players in his draft class.   I also thought Ben Simmons was going to be close to the same level as Magic Johnson by this point in his career.   I was definitely wrong about both.
Dante Exum was here all along.
Throw in some players who will collectively get flipped for Kelly olynyk and Dante exum and it’s a done deal
*Dante Exum has entered the chat*
"It's because of the name. I remember people would always be like ""Haha what about Exum, Dante Exum?"" when talking about prospects, but no one actually knew anything about his game."
I *still* believe in Dante Exum.....
"i miss dante, and Exum Island :("
It's Dante Exum.
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
I thought dante exum and dennis Smith jr were going to be stars....I like to think I'm smarter now when it comes to prospect evaluations.
"Ya , its why the league sucks.  Lebron, Trae young, harden , Julius Randle,  KD , etc... all get that call.  If that was Dante exum driving on lebron it's not a foul.   Hell it wasn't a foul this entire game.  And the contact was initiated by Youngs arm .  The rules changed the last 4 minutes of that game"
"eh, I don't know. It seems the same guys tend to get unrelated injury after injury. DeMarcus Cousins, Rodney Hood, Gordon Hayward, Dante Exum and others."
Ante zizic vs Dante exum
"Yep. Should really never pick a player if they've ever had an injury. Very stupid thinking from Philly, we should let Michael Porter Jr fall to 14 in every draft! Genius. I wish we had Aaron Gordon or Dante Exum now!"
"Were the Sixers tanking when they drafted Joel Embiid instead of a healthy player who could contribute like Dante Exum? Were they tanking when they traded away future superstar Michael Carter Williams for a first round pick? Were they tanking when they took a future first and Dario Saric who wouldn't come over for two years in exchange for Elfrid Payton? And were they tanking when they gave minutes to g leaguers like Robert Covington or second round picks like Jerami Grant?  Or is it possible young players just need time to develop or get healthy? Is it possible Michael Carter Williams or Evan Turner weren't going to result in the Sixers winning more games? And is it possible after the Sixers traded away essentially everything valuable they had for a player who would never play a single game for them, it was not feasible to put together a competitive team immediately?   Who's to say? I don't know but I don't think it's you. You're not the Sixers expert you pretend to be  Edit: Also what is this?  &gt;Just going through the replies you will see many readers were misinformed by the false narrative you pushed  Did a child write this?"
"&gt; Randle was nowhere near bust status or having is NBA career in jeopardy, many Lakers fans wanted to keep him.  That is part of my point. Even he doesn't fit. Pretty much no one does.  &gt;It's an interesting point you make but players mocked that high don't constantly fail as hard as the Suns did even if it takes them going to another team.  But if it was because of the Suns failure to develop them, other teams should find tons of value swooping and picking up these young guys with star potential. Turns out they are pretty nonfactor on their teams no matter where they go and not anywhere close to being a star that many predicted before the Suns drafted them.  &gt;The Suns didn't reach but these guys failed spectacularly, there must be something the Suns were doing wrong in terms of player development that made them irredeemable.  If you got a coin and flip it 10 times it wont likely alternate heads then tails everytime. You are likely get a string of heads and/or a string of tails. It is a crapshoot. The Utah Jazz picked Kanter, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, Dante Exum, Trey Lyles to Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. This is also true accross sports, Seahawks had a string of historically great draft classes in the early 2010's to pretty bad recently in comparison. It often takes 1 or 2 players to chance an entire narrative of draft history and if 76ers never got Embiid, if Bucks never got Giannis, and if Kings got Doncic instead of Bagley, it would change entire prespectives."
"If Dante Exum wasn't made of glass, and actually had time to learn and develop, he could be a great player.  Dude had an incredible NBA body, but never learned how to use it."
"2014 was a weird draft class. Wiggins 1st, Jabari Parker 2nd.    Embiid at 3rd, Aaron Gordon 4th and Marcus Smart 6th were the only top ten picks that weren't total busts imo. Remember Dante Exum and Nic Stauskas? Yeah me neither but they sound kind of familiar. Elfrid Payton, to whom I've frequently heard Knicks fans refer as the devil himself, rounds it off at number 10.    Zach Lavine went 13th, and Jokic didnt get taken until the 2nd round. Crazy huh?    CBS sports ranks it as the 5th worst draft class of the last two decades: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-draft-looking-back-and-ranking-the-five-worst-draft-classes-since-2000/"
"Funny enough, the Jazz had the fifth pick that year and drafted Dante Exum, who we traded to Cleveland for...Jordan Clarkson.  So we got a great guy out of the 2014 draft class, just in a really roundabout way."
dont forget about dante exum. He didnt do shit but he was in that draft class. So dont forget
"We've made the best pick available three drafts in a row and now we're getting Mobley.  We got Jarrett Allen for free.   Larry Nance is one of the most valuable assets in the league and we got him for Isaiah Thomas and a pick that turned into Moritz Wagner (we also got Clarkson in that trade; he was traded for two seconds and Dante Exum, our main contribution to the Allen trade).  Everyone loves to dunk on the Cavs but we're recovering much more quickly than other rebuilding teams.  If Love didn't suck we'd probably be looking at playoffs next year."
Jrue holiday either plays like Dante Exum or Dame no in between 😭
"""Victor Oladipo, Rodions Kurucs, Dante Exum, four unprotected first-round picks (Brooklyn 2022, 2024 and 2026, Milwaukee 2022), and four unprotected first-round pick swaps"" enough for 1 dame?"
So you want Dante exum at #3 instead of embiid because Noel exists is what you're telling me? You go best player availa le until you have a stud.
"The problem with your logic means you are taking Dante exum instead of embiid because you already have Noel. At the time Hinkie was pushed out Okafor and Noel still had value and Embiid had never played. The next regime came in, sat on them, and basically had to pay to get rid of both. It was a gross mismanagement of players and assets. You think the guy who's specialty is selling high isn't getting value back for either of those guys? He never had an opportunity to clear the log jam because he was fired but if there's one thing there's no doubt about it is his trading acumen."
"Dante Exum, now sponsored by Corning Gorilla Glass"
"Fun fact - Dante Exum (Aus) and Chima Moneke (Nig) went to the same high school in Canberra, Australia."
dante exum \*should\* be so much better than he is. really gets me down him and ben didnt reach their potential so far.
Buried here is Dante Exum can barely even get minutes for the Australian national team.
"Holy shit you met Patty Mills, Ben Simmons, AND Dante Exum?"
Literally every single team in the league would win gold. Even the Rockets without Dante Exum
"Even then the Australia team only has 6 NBA players (Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova and Josh Green)."
Josh Green (Mavericks)  Will Magnay (Pelicans)   Matisse Thybulle (76ers)   Patty Mills (Spurs)   Aron Baynes (Raptors)   Dante Exum (Rockets)   Matthew Dellavedova (Cavaliers)  Joe Ingles (Jazz)
"I get your point that it's not really accurate to suggest it's NBA talent vs a whole bunch of not NBA talent, but Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova, Matisse Thybull, and Josh Green vs Damien Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Jarami Grant, Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Zach LaVine, and Jayson Tatum isn't exactly close in individual talent."
Imagine losing to Mathew dellavafuckingdova and Dante fucking exum
Imagine losing to Joe Ingles and Dante Exum
Dante Exum gained AT LEAST 30 pounds
"dante exum is so fat, what the hell, he is an nba guard"
Who says the rockets would have kept him? They could’ve traded him for more assets.  I get you guys are still trying to cope with the fact that you guys got absolutely fleeced.  The lakers gave the Pelicans    Ingram  Lonzo  Hart   Plus a shit load of  picks and swaps for AD  The rockets literally only got    Oladipo who’s no longer on the team   Dante Exum and  Rodions Kurucs.  Picks and swaps for James Harden who is way better then AD   That was an all time horrible trade
Dante Exum. Because on 2k15 I always smoked this bum and he’d still talk trash to me. Kinda crazy he’s only 25 but been in the league since 2014. Feels older to me
"dante exum, mostly because of injuries but yeah"
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
Dante exum would kick this guys ass
Lol remember Dante Exum was supposed to be the next Kobe.  Not saying he would’ve worked out but they stunted Trey Burke’s development to groom Exum and only one of them is still getting minutes in the NBA
"Dante Exum could have been great. I think he could have become what Donovan Mitchell is right now. He had so much promise, it's truly a shame."
"Man I was so high on Dante Exum. I thought he'd basically be what SGA is, but with better slashing/first step"
Start Dante Exum he was picked higher than Donovan Mitchell
start dante exum huh
Damn I always thought patty mills was like Kyrie / Ben simmons type Aussie   But dude is like Dante Exum/ ingles type Aussie
"In the offseason after the Rockets loss, I thought Dante Exum would get healthy, shake the injury bug and he'd be the starting PG of the future for the Jazz... not looking too hot on that one unfortunately."
"Yeah he sucks compared to *checks notes*  Dante Exum, Rodions Kuruks, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk  4 first round picks and 5 pick swaps with contenders.   You suck Ben!"
Another Dante Exum.
Rox could've had him and ended up with Dante Exum and a fun size bag of funyuns
There's a difference in observing Jason Kidd vs observing Dante Exum
Whatever happened to Dante Exum?
"Dante Exum turned out great. Yeah, let’s go with that."
Dante Exum too
"His dad's name was Cecil Exum so Dante isn't that much of a reach.  Random trivia, his dad played with Jordan at NC, and shifted to Australia to play there"
"Jazz gonna get Simmons and Patty Mills, then bring back Dante Exum as an assistant coach. They playing Pit while the rest of the league is playing Monopoly and they're cornering the market on Australians."
"I'm not even sure Dante Exum is a real person. In fact now that I think about it, his name sounds made up."
Is Dante exum playing for them? And has Kyrie ever expressed an interest in playing for them?
This is *exactly* what Dante Exum used to do.
Dante Exum and Ben Simmons were scary on paper.
"Dante Exum anyone, anyone??"
Surprised to see Dante exum there. Feel like I haven’t seeen him on the floor for a couple years now
"If the Jazz had given us Dante Exum and kept Jae Crowder in the Conley trade, like we supposedly asked for, is the LAC/UTA series headed for a game 7 right now?  Felt like they got absolutely exposed for having only one good perimeter defender."
Yeah haven’t you seen all the dante exum stans?
Ain’t got shit on Dante Exum
Dante Exum and Frank are the most egregious to me. their stock was based on frame and hype and not a lot of production to speak of. Even Mudiay makes sense to me because he was very good in high school.
"Off the top of my head, Dante Exum, Markelle Fultz, Justise Winslow, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina"
"I'd argue Jabari shouldn't be there and I'd probably put Dante Exum,  Only because in Jabari's 3rd season he actually averaged 20.1 ppg"
dante exum 2014
2k14 acted like dante exum was going to be solid
I only remember Dante Exum because of the awful beef with the player on my career in 2K15.
"Some others that have claims to biggest bust in their drafts:  2010 - Evan Turner, Wesley Johnson  2011 - Jan Vesely  2012 - Thomas Robinson  2014 - Dante Exum  2015 - Mario Hezonja  Pretty much everyone else is unanimous or still too early, but anyone you put is a reasonable selection."
"Dante Exum pre-injury had a HOF first step, honestly in my mind it was better than guys like Parker, Wade, Rose. Equally as quick but with longer strides."
They should work out Dante Exum. He will be a fan favourite.  Dude balled out at the Olympics.  Good sized guard that can handle the ball and can play D.
Dante Exum needs to return!!!!
"I still think Dante Exum has way more potential than Gel Ball.  I just don’t want him to go to Portland (nothing against the city, just don’t want him to get any more injuries)."
Dante Exum
KP. Dante Exum. Harrison Barnes.
Dante Exum. He was ridiculously hyped on r/nba before the draft.
"Dante Exum, DeJuan Wagner"
All I know about Dante Exum is from 2k pushing him in MyCareer.
Dante Exum
Not top 5 but I definitely though Dante Exum was going to reach a higher tier. Dennis Smith Jr too.
Dante Exum. Heard he was gonna be one of the best guards in the league
"I still own real estate on Dante Exum island, and I don't ever plan on selling baby!"
Dante Exum  Derrick Favors  Larry Sanders
dante exum
"Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr, Tyreke Evans, OJ Mayo, Adam Morrison, Emmanuel Mudiay, Jahlil Okafor, and more lol. There’s a lot of these guys 😭"
"dante exum, although i believe this has been due to injuries more than his ability."
"That's just the story that Tillman didn't want to deal with Morey. There is 0 evidence of trhat happening. According to Kevin O’Connor, the 76ers never made it to the asking price that included 3 FRPs and Maxey + Thybulle. Tillman cares about money more than winning though and Oladipo / Olynyk / Avery Bradley / Dante Exum / DJ Wilson were all expiring contracts to ensure the Rockets wouldn't be forced into the luxury tax that Tillman never wanted to pay in more competitive seasons even to trade draft picks to get under the tax at the 2019 deadline."
Dante Exum
"I'm sure you've witnessed the same with Ntilikina. Us Pistons fans are holding onto what we know he *could* be, and are focussing on his positive defense. He's showed enough flashes for us to not completely give up. I think he's in a similar mould to Ntilikina and Dante Exum, just needs to break out of it"
Will Australian Dante Exum get a contract in FA after his Olympics performance?
" Melbourne Australia:  I think we get Kyrie? He was born in Melbourne and that’s the criteria even if idk if he grew up here   So; PG: Kyrie, SG: Dante Exum, SF: Ben Simmons, PF: Jonah Bolden, C: Andrew Bogut  With Luc Longley and Andrew Gaze off the bench, both these guys are pretty interchangeable with Bolden who touched the league briefly with the Sixers . The real choice is probably to Longley in starting lineup but my brain won’t let Simmons Longley and Bogut on the court together even in a hypothetical, maybe move Ben to the 4 and slot Gaze in at the 3.  Either way I reckon this is better than most people expected"
Dante Exum
"I really wished Dante Exum succeeded. He's so good, but injuries have hurt him badly (and he's so inconstant)"
"I'm a homer but I think Dante Exum is a better option coming off the bench as a PG. As long as you sufficient sroing options on the team of course. He gives incredible defence, is a good runner with an elite first step. His major question is his health."
If you want a Aussie PG that can play D there's worse choices than Dante Exum.   And by worse choices I mean Delly.
"Which team (if any), would you like to see sign Dante Exum?"
Dante exum is worth it as a 3rd PG/SG
"It took 7 years for Dante ""flashes of MJ"" Exum to finally fall out of the league.. draft day hype is too much"
Dante Exum?
"Dante Exum. SGA, dejounte Murray, fox, MPJ depending on Murray,"
Dante Exum gets PICKED on.
Dante Exum was clutch as fuck. Someone sign this man
"How good was that stretch by Dante Exum? A charge, a three and then a steal and dunk. Can’t believe he’s still a FA. Someone sign him!"
The team that doesn’t sign Dante Exum will regret it!
Gotta format like OP  • Dante Exum (Free Agent)
It’s crazy to me that Dante Exum just turned 26. This mf tore my ass up in 2k back in the day. 2k14 was so damn long ago it’s wild
Im biased but Dante Exum could be a solid pg next season.
Dante Exum.
Dante Exum
I will never hear any dante exum slander ever again that man single handedly changed the momentum in the 4th to get us home
Dante Exum really just played himself into a roster spot didn’t he
Dante Exum turned into prime TMac out there with 6 to go
"Dante Exum deserves a spot on someones roster, his defence is incredible. Thybulle is a blessing to have as an Aussie, and Patty I still have my signed Portland Patty picture in my office of you. I love you"
"Dante Exum really earned another look from NBA teams this Olympics. He still needs to learn how to land safely, but he showed off a really improved jumper and some real court vision."
The game was getting tight in the 4th and Dante exum broke the game open
"Ahh yes, the Dante - Luka rivalry will be one to watch for the next decade and beyond.  For real, Exum was huge in that last quarter."
"Ahhh yes, the Dante - Luka rivalry will be one to watch for the next decade and beyond.  For real, Exum was huge in that last quarter."

"With 6 minutes remaining Australia has conceded a 13-2 run and were leading just 85-80.      - 5:55, Dante Exum draws an offensive foul.  - 5:40, Dante Exum hits a corner 3, 88-80.  - 5:15, Dante Exum gets a transition dunk. 90-80.   - 4:15, Dante Exum drives in and finds Ingles for a corner three as Australia break away.    Further down the track in the last 2:30, Dante Exum made clutch free throws and hit a dagger 3!    Patty Mills was sensational with his buckets but Dante Exum was also INSTRUMENTAL in turning the tide again when momentum was against us and securing the victory."
"Ahh yes, the Dante - Luka rivalry will be at the forefront of our screens for a decade.  For real, Exum was huge in that last quarter."
"Dante ""free agent in the NBL"" exum"
"Dante ""Olympic Patty Mills"" Exum.  Edit: Anyone catch Luka and Matisse chirping at each other in the end? lol"
Dame must have not realized Dante Exum was still available when he made those comments about us missing our guy in free agency.
PATTY TISSE INGLES AND DANTE FUCKING EXUM HAVE BEEN HUGE
Is Dante Exum the best two way player in the world?
Did Dante Exum save Australian basketball? Tune in after this break
Dante exum is a fucking hero. Couple huge plays when we really needed it
DANTE EXUM!!!
Lottery pick Dante Exum lol
DANTE FUCKING EXUM
I would like to formally apologise to Dante Exum
THAT'S PICK NO.5 DANTE EXUM TO YOU
 Dante Exum is the greatest player ever
Patty Mills is who Dante Exum thinks he is
Dante Exum would be a great signing
Dante Exum
I dont understand why went to college in the first place and couldn't just have done what a player like Dante Exum did
Dante Exum
"Did Joe Ingles played? In all seriousness, I can only remember one shot from him in the second half. He shot the same amount of shots as Dante Exum wtf."
"1. Forget to play defense early and go down double digits  2. Players realize they are about to get blown out by Dante Exum  3. Coach calls a timeout, comes up with new plan: Give the ball to KD  4. Comeback by halftime and cruise to the dub"
dante exum*
"Good game.  Boomers played hard, but once the USA team start playing actual defense and hitting threes, there's not a lot you can do.  A reminder for any NBA GMs in this thread - Dante Exum and several others of the Australian players are still unsigned to NBA contracts."
Dante Exum getting himself another NBA contract these olympics
Utah Jazz legend Dante Exum!
Dante Exum really yelled and screamed while up 15 made KD angry. Patty tried to tell him to calm down too haha
Dante Exum to the suns.  I’m calling it right now
Anyone know what's up with Dante Exum?
Who signing Dante Exum? I'd take him over Schroder tbh
Dante exum one of the biggest NBA busts ever.
"unfortunately the full dante exum experience  some nice defense, made a three, got injured  the full deal"
Man Dante exum getting that Boris Diaw body
Unrelated but this makes so much sense why Wiggins shoots long 2's. He's just trying to become the next FIBA Dante Exum
"My son, Dante Exum, is dominating! I'm so conflicted"
Dante Exum??
Utah Jazz legend: Dante Exum.
I still believe in Dante Exum
We gettin fucked by Dante Exum boys
Dante Exum looking like a top 5 pick.
I LOVE DANTE EXUM
Dante Exum trying to steal my heart.  Orlando should draft him head of Aaron Gordon.  Calling it now.  Exum for the 5th pick
"A healthy Dante Exum is worth the money, a non healthy Exum sounds like he doesn’t get the money."
Dante Exum obviously.
"Lol someone on YouTube commented that ""If it wasn’t for a bad run of injuries, Exum would be a legit all-star"".  Granted it, it was posted 3 years ago but I dont remember anyone that ever said that Dante Exum was going to be a future All-Star back in 2018."
"It's easy to be a draft savant when you have hindsight on your side.  I am looking at the drafts now in fact. Look at the top 5's:  2013: Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len   2014: Wiggins, Jabari, Embiid, Gordon, Dante Exum   2 out of 10 players ended up being great. If anything it makes the Cavs look better for trading while the guys still had high value.  The guys still available when they drafted Waiters were Thomas Robinson, Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, etc. So in all these scenarios there's one really great player that they missed (and 4-5 other teams passed on as well). If they took Giannis #1 in 2013 the GM would've been fired on the spot.   The Bennett pick is bad and one of the worst of all-time. But even that the likely alternative would've still been considered one of the biggest busts ever (unless they took Oladipo). I remember the hype leading up to the draft Alex Len was the most common projected #1. The other picks range from average to pretty good. They took TT over Jan Vesely, Biyombo, Knight, etc. Kyrie over Derrick Williams."
Dante Exum in 3.
"Ah, yes, but I have no memories of specifically watching him play so I’m going to cherry pick some inconsistent stats to prove that I’m the smartest and that Dante Exum will never be an asset! /S for the loonies.  If you watched Exum in the Olympics you know he can be an asset.  He’s still only 26 and about to enter his prime. Houston is making a smart play here, because if he proves valuable that minimal $ deal can turn into a future asset for their rebuild."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2403167-why-dante-exum-is-the-nbas-defensive-rookie-of-the-year  https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/sports/pro/cavs/2021/01/04/dante-exums-defense-defines-his-role-cavs/4125061001/  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/dante-exum-defense-rating  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/dante-exum-defensive-rating-2021
From memory rookie Dante Exum started the second half of the season replacing Trey Burke which would have made a big size difference too.
"Dragan Bender, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Dario Saric, Enes Kanter, Jonas Valanciunas, Jan Vesely, Ricky Rubio.  It's not that hard to understand. The hit rate on the top international guys leading up to Doncic was very poor, and Luka had worse physical tools than most of them. Ricky Rubio was billed as a can't miss guy in a similar vein to Luka, and then he missed."
When Cleveland traded Jordan Clarkson for Dante exum people on Twitter were mocking that trade saying they both were essentially the same player. Not so much now.
"&gt;Because the incentives would officially be considered likely bonuses, they would be included in outgoing salary if Dante Exum were to be traded. Per sources, incentives discussed are based on Exum's average minutes and plus-minus in games played.  My mans depending on plus-minus lmao"
Dante Exum.
"It wasn’t really all that clutch. We came into the series missing Rubio in the form of his life, which had already pretty much doomed us, and then Donovan got hurt in the final quarter which was the last straw. We weren’t gonna be a threat starting Dante Exum and a rookie Royce O’neale game 6."
I will never sell my stock.  Dante Exum is the reason I follow basketball and the reason I support the Jazz
I thought Dante Exum would be the prototypical combo guard who would be a near all-star eventually.  I thought RJ Hunter would have a 10 year career as a spot up shooter.  I thought Mario Hezonja was the next European star and would average something like 18/4/4 for a while.  I stopped thinking and just wait to see now.
"ok thats more fair enough. I still disagree but it makes more sense. Cleveland before the 90s were an absolute joke. No ones going to disagree with that. They were great in the 90s. Then tanked for a bunch of years to get Lebron. Had a successful 7 years. Rebuild for 4 years but built the pieces for Lebron to come back and have success with TT and Kyrie as well as the trade for Love. Take away KDs snake tactics and the cavs would have won more than 1. 3 years into a rebuild rn and have a great scoring prospect, a PG with great potential, a young skilled big project that was a consensus top 3 pick and traded for Jarett Allen and only lost Dante Exum and a second. I mean thats some good trades and potentially good picks picking 8-5 3 years in a row before getting #3. So your wrong and I believe the next couple seasons the boys will prove you wrong but I'll give you that your argument makes more sense and is fair enough."
"Oof. Has anyone so clearly not been an NBA player from Day One more than Kevin Knox? I kept looking at the screen and then saying to myself, ""but he was drafted 9th"" as if, somehow, that would translate to his play.  Mine is Dante Exum. I never saw footage of him from Australia but every article I read talked about him like he was a huge sleeper. Turns out he never woke up."
"Same with Dante Exum, would be great coming off the bench to play D and a bit of ball handling duties"
"I'd say Cleveland as well. We've traded the following players one way or another:      Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, George Hill, Dante Exum, Kyle Korver, Alec Burks and best of all Jordan Clarkson."
DANTE EXUM
DANTE EXUM!!!
Dante Exum is exactly who the Jazz need
Dante Exum not being made of glass and aluminum foil would’ve been awesome.
We think Dante exum will get picked up by anyone. He looked good at the Olympics?
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
"Jazz took Dante Exum at three or four I believe, one of the highest picks in franchise history. Man proved to be made of glass. Ate up cap for years while playing virtually no minutes. Still glad to see him have some success on the Aussie national team though, and hope he can nab a contract in the league again."
"Dante Exum, Andre Roberson, Tony Allen"
Dante Exum.  Even though there are **still** holdouts on Exum Island over at r/UtahJazz
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
Emmanuel Mudiay and Dante Exum are Bum tier.
* Dante Exum * Nik Stauskas * Solomon Hill * Aleksej Pokusevski * Alex Len
Dante Exum for Jordan Clarkson
"As a Jazz fan, there are a few that come to mind that could end up looking this bad for other teams.  Dante Exum and 2nd round picks for Jordan Clarkson seems like the Jazz made off with it considering what has come of Clarkson and Exum  The other two are the Nuggets getting a pick and Trey Lyles back for Donovan Mitchell's draft rights and the Nugs sending Rudy Gobert's draft rights for a second and cash."
Dante Exum baby!
"I hope that cash bought Denver a nice toaster for their break room or something. None of the other 3 players ever did anything for them. Building off that list, I  would also tack on Jordan Clarkson for Dante Exum and two second round picks.   Gobert via trade, Mitchell via trade, Clarkson via trade, Ingles via waivers and O'Neale was undrafted. 5 of the top 8 Jazz players were scooped up for free basically. Not the point of the thread but it is interesting to think about"
I thought Dante Exum would be a stud and make a couple All Star games for the Jazz. A dud if anything. He wasn't even the best aussie on our team lol. Should've drafted Marcus Smart instead.
I swear Dante Exum was supposed to be a taller prime Derrick Rose
"Don't forget Dante Exum, pride of Australia."
"I still remember the three headed monster playing PG for the Jazz: Mack, Raulzinho Neto and Dante Exum"
I hear Dante Exum might be available
"the legend of dante exum, greatest PG in rockets history. dude was lightning quick, it's as if he wasn't even here.   lowkey was hoping we could keep him as a defensive guard to pair up with either kpj/jalen, but armoni deserves his contract more"
Dw I’m fully aware of the goat. He and urban legend Dante exum getting the bag next year 💯
Don't disrespect Dante Exum like that.
"Created a [Dante Exum Highlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc8U6DZQoVk) and some [others](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7prenMovWf572Z-xSHiXbA)  .. Bummed about Exum, hope he gets another chance in the NBA."
"He’s literally the polar opposite of all the guys who played for the Boomers. Patty, Tisse, Josh Green, Baynes all those guys would run through a brick wall for our country. Hell, Dante Exum was a free agent who could’ve done with an offseason but instead chose to play for the Boomers without hesitation. I really doubt Ben would fit in on that team"
"Dante Exum was waived by Houston, so maybe a quick call..."

Dante Exum.
"His Dad played with Ben Simmons and Dante Exums fathers in the early 90s for the Melbourne Tigers. Warrwick Giddey, Dave Simmons and Cecil Exum. Cecil Exum won a NCAA championship with Michael Jordan."
"That draft had the coolest names in the lottery. Dante Exum, Marcus Smart, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, etc etc. Any one of those names could have been a superstar's name. The next LeBron James or Kevin Durant. Hardest draft to pick in imo. Just high potential names all around."
"Cam Reddish, Malik Monk, Justice Winslow, Kris Dunn, Mo Bamba, Lonnie Walker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Kyle Kuzma. I think Kuzma is going to be at least mentioned in all-star considerations being Washginton's second option.  There's the obvious choices that everyone won't shut up about like OG, Poole, and Herro, and their fanbases are being so obnoxious about then that I kinda want them to fail. Less Herro than the other two since he already had his hype a year ago."
"In no particular order based on draft class and whatever comes to mind that I remember having a strong opinion on -   High - Zion Williamson, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins  High but missed the mark - Wendell Carter Jr, Ben McLemore, Kevin Knox, Lauri Markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, Malik Monk, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters, Evan Turner"
The order is   Dante Exum  Emoni Bates  Solomon Hill  Chet Holmgren   I ordered them by how many letters are in their name.
Shiiiet i still have real estate on Dante Exum island
I'm still waiting for Dante Exum to be a Magic Johnson type player. :(

"I am from Melbourne Australia. Was a big fan of Melbourne Tigers growing up. Ben's dad was a prominent player that time.  I am currently friends with a few kids of the retired 80s-90s NBL American players who ended up staying in Melbourne. The US born NBL dads are a pretty close knitted circle. All the kids kinda grew up along side each other. Most of the son are not close friends but more like ""family friends"" type of deal. The word was Simmon's family knew Ben had the talent and big chance going to NBA very very very early. I am talking his name was mentioned to me 12+ years ago. And the only other name I ever heard remotely close at the time was Dante Exum but it wasn't that early. And what I heard his family did baby him as such.  Very early on the word on the streets was alot of hands off my son type of vibes, in terms of coaching, advice especially around basketball people. Ben's family was very protective and because of that alot of lifetime friendships within Australian basketball community was distanced. Still in Australia today there is alot of tension. Because Australia basketball ultimately wants Ben to represent Australia one day and  there is still alot of walking on egg shells in terms what inside people can and cannot say regarding Ben and his family.  I imagine alot of stories will start to come out from Australia if Ben pull out of Paris Olympics. Alot of bad blood being building and prominent people lost their job in Basketball Australia because Ben pulled out of the World Championship squad few years ago."
"It's a rather poor return that they got for Harden, to be honest.  Rockets got Oladipo, Exum, Brooklyn's 2022, 2024, and 2026 1sts, and Milwaukee's 2022 1st (from Cleveland).  There's pick swaps in there (2021, 2023, 2025, 2027) but those are unlikely to convey any time soon (the 2021 did not).  They traded Oladipo on to Miami for Avery Bradley (left in free agency), Kelly Olynyk (left in free agency) and a 2022 pick swap.  Here's what Houston still has from the Harden trade:  * Brooklyn 2022, 2024, &amp; 2026 1sts (2022 and 2024 are likely to be late round picks.  2026 is too far out to say)    * Milwaukee's 2022 1st (likely to be a late round pick)    * Pick swap with Miami in 2022- unlikely to convey    * Pick swaps with Brooklyn in 2023 (unlikely to convey), 2025 (possibly conveys), and 2027 (possibly conveys)    * Dante Exum  That's a lot of nothing for Harden  Vs the rumored package of Simmons, Thybulle, picks and potentially Maxey.  Even if you think that Simmons isn't worth building around, you turn and flip him like they tried to with Dipo."
Dante Exum still exists buddy.
But Joel was considered the best player in the draft. 76ers were lucky to get him because of his injury history. Why are you being obtuse referencing Dante Exum? Aaron Gordon went before him and he’d have been an excellent fit for Philly had they not taken Embiid.
ok then you get Dante Exum instead of Embiid because you already have Noel.  Great plan
Dante Exum being only 26 and Ricky Rubio only being 30 always fuck with me.
We got Jarrett Allen for Dante Exum and the Bucks pick.
Then I'd like to submit Dante Exum to the argument. If he never had an injury I still think he would be a super star.
Dante Exum was that guy for me
Ok then you end up with Dante exum instead of embiid because you just drafted nerlens. You go bpa until you have someone to build around.
"De'Anthony Melton   Dante Exum if he ever gets healthy (that's a big if, honestly)   Nerlans Noel: I don't think he'll ever reach the success of Chandler, but I think he'll be a starter 6 years from now; many people have already written him off."
"Simmons, Mal Brog, Dante Exum. The Other Ball."
2011 Enes Kanter - Tristan Thompson  2012 Kevin Murphy - Kostas Papanikolaou  2013 Shabazz Muhammad - Giannis Antetokounmpo  2014 Dante Exum - Marcus Smart  2015 Trey Lyles - Devin Booker   Just wtf

"I was very, very high on Dante Exum, thought he'd end up being the best player in that draft. Also really liked Kris Dunn. Likened him to Gary Payton on more than one occasion."
Dante Exum
If we’re doing former players then it’s gotta be Dante exum for me
"Or Mudiay, or Dante Exum."
Lakers need Dante Exum  Yeah I said it
I can't stand Dante Exum becuase he talked smack in My career in 2K and he couldn't back it up because he sucks!
any mysterious raw lanky pg who has good defensive tools get dante exum/frank ntilikina comps
I feel like I see Dante Exum a lot and I have to google to refresh my memory on who that was
"Can’t wait till he plays on the Australian team at the next Olympics.  Giddey, Thybulle and Josh Green will all be going into their prime. Patty will probably have one last run before he retires.  Still have Joe Ingles, Dante Exum, Jock Landale and Aron Baynes.  X-Factor is if Ben Simmons finally joins. Figure he has a shot at it if he wants to redeem his image."
Dante Exum for sure
Dante Exum had a pretty quick first step
You wouldn't because nobody watched Dante exum at length
"I might get flamed here, but anybody who has watched Dante Exum at length knows he belongs in this conversation."
"Honestly, being good enough to be considered an All Star snub is a decent outcome for a 5th overall pick. There was a five-year span when the fifth picks were Thomas Robinson, Alex Len, Dante Exum, Mario Hezonja, and Kris Dunn.   I agree about Wagner though. He’s gonna go really high in re-drafts of a draft that will produce a ton of really good players."
Concept Dante Exum
you should add Dante Exum to that list
Everything after the top is pretty random though. You can’t tell me Wiggins was a huge bust when other top 5 draft picks are Dante Exum and Jabari Parker
Dante exum can do what Russ does for about $44m less cash
Dante Exum
"Player heights up to very recently were very skewed. I met Alec Burks, Dante Exum, and Derrick Favors after a game once. I’m a legit 6,6” without shoes and was easily taller than Dante and Alec. Dante is taller than Alec too even though they were listed as the same height. Derrick favors was prob 6’8”"
"To be more accurate, it was a 2022 Bucks first (to Houston), 2024 Cavs second (to Brooklyn), and Dante Exum (to Houston) in exchange for Allen and Prince.  Later, Prince was flipped alongside 2022 Wizards second and cash considerations for Spanish Jesus.  As an aside, Cavs own Spurs’ and Rockets’ 2022 seconds as well as all their firsts."
"It was a first, second and Dante Exum iirc"
They could've but instead wanted Dante exum and a 2nd round pick I think. They didn't want to pay him
The closest - 2020 Cavs:  * Kevin Love son of Stan Love * Larry Nance Jr son of Larry Nance * Darius Garland son of Winston Garland * Dante Exum son of Cecil Exum (drafted in the 9th round by the Nuggets) * Coach J. B. Bickerstaff son of Bernie Bickerstaff
Dame was a 5th pick that year. Even if they had the exact same record and had the same 5th pick it doesn’t guarantee a superstar. The next 4 draftees at #5 are Alex Len 2013. Dante Exum 2014. Mario Henzonja 2015. Kris Dunn 2016. Plenty of other too picks are misses as well.   That’s assuming they never improve and are able to pick 5th every year. It’s more than losing games and getting high picks. Just gotta hit when you do. And pick up quality free agents.   Obviously they could’ve picked different players but the point stands that having high picks isn’t the problem as much as hitting the picks like they did with McCollum. Tanking doesn’t guarantee you anything.   I’d rather win 50 games and try to trade or get free agents to join me. That’s Portlands biggest issue. Warriors were a 50 win team then they picked up Iggy. Lakers MO is free agency. Bucks traded for Jrue Holiday. Raptors traded for Kawhi. Portland sucks at getting Dame help through other means.
Dante Exum for Clarkson would be up there too.
Dante Exum over Marcus smart 😔
We also sent out the corpse of Dante Exum
"His draft class kinda sucked. Imagine looking at a top 5 draft that included Dante Exum, Aaron Gordon, and Jabari Parker…  Wiggins was hyped up because he was sooo much better than those dudes (excluding Joel)."
"death, tax and Dante Exum getting injured"
Every team signs Dante Exum to a temporary 1 game contract.
"Yeah, I definitely wish that we have more players available for the next game, our depth chart is looking rough:   &amp;nbsp;  [](/CLE)Cavs|**Starter**|**2nd**|**3rd**|**4th**|**5th**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |PG|~~Darius Garland~~ |~~Dante Exum~~|~~Matthew Dellavedova~~|Collin Sexton|-| |SG|Collin Sexton|~~Dylan Windler~~ |Damyean Dotson|~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |SF|~~Isaac Okoro~~ |~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~|Cedi Osman|~~Dylan Windler~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |PF|~~Kevin Love~~ |Larry Nance Jr.|Cedi Osman|~~Isaac Okoro~~|Dean Wade| |C|Andre Drummond|Larry Nance Jr.|JaVale McGee|~~Kevin Love~~|Thon Maker|   Also, unrelated, but Cole Anthony looked pretty good in there tonight for Orlando."

Trae mad he got clamped by Dante Exum all game
"I got some ptsd flashbacks watching this, but also LET'S GO DANTE EXUM"
Dante Exum great full-court defense in the clutch*
Full court clamps.   Dante Exum DPOY? You can tell Dante Exum was in Trae Young’s head. He got so many clutch stops.
"I know the Hawks looked completely gassed, but my god it's nice to win games with defense. Dante Exum locking up Trae and guarding 1-3 is a very nice development."
Dante Exum put the clamps on John Collins.  You guys are disrespecting the elite defense right there. Embarrassing.
If your losing to Dante Exum it's time to hold yourself accountable.
Dante Exum 2K15 type beat
Dante exum is a fiba God??
Dante Exum looking like Kobe
Dante “sign me bitches” Exum
Cavaliers legend Dante Exum
Dante Exum &gt; Dame and Devin combined !!!
I remember Dante Exum was hyped coming into the draft. And then the injuries...
Getting bodied by a team with continuity. Absolutely no excuse for a team of all-stars to get embarrassed by Patty Mills and Dante Exum lol
"just started watching basketball this olympics, are these the top 5 guys in the nba  1. Kevin Durant  2. Luka Doncic  3. Patty Mills   4. Zoran Dragic  5. Dante Exum"
"Carna Aussies.   Keep moving it, and keep getting good looks and good things are going to happen.  PS Attention NBA GMs. Dante Exum is worth a minimum contract deal."
"I want the US to win, but I keep finding myself rooting for the team with Joe Ingles (and Dante Exum)"
"Ahhh, the ol' Dante Exum."
"Dante Exum is a track star that wants to play Basketball. He's always looked good in international play, but never shown any consistency in the NBA."
the only thing dante exum ever had going for him was his cool name
"NBA 2k15 Point God Dante Exum. Start as 6ers trade some assets for him, lance stephenson and James Brown of the celtics and have 4-90 rated players by year 4."
"wow, rockets legend dante exum in there too"
dont forget to sign Dante Exum and Nick Kay
Dante Exum balling out   You love to see it
I just arrived from the moon after 30 years. Is Dante Exum the greatest basketball player ever?
I hope the Bucks sign either Patty Mills or Dante Exum. Or both. Both would be excellent.
DANTE FUCKINH EXUM!!!!
Dante fucking Exum
Dante exum oh my WORD
How’s this relevant. There’s still extraordinary talent from America that lately find ways to lose to the other countries. Separately dante exum is marginally less of a bust that Anthony Bennett
"The NBA guys on teams other than the US are still in the top couple of hundred players on the planet, at worst.   People act like Australia found Dante Exum at the park and gave him a jersey."
Dante Exum literally exists.
Yep. We need that cap space to offer Dante Exum a max.
One day Carsen Edwards and Dante Exum will team up in the Lakers. We gotta counteract the bad mojo.
dante exum redemption arc starts now
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
"Idc, he’s Australian. He’s gonna be the best player in the league in like a year. Dante Exum will be 2nd."
In my head I can't keep him and Dante Exum straight.  Everything I know about them just blurs together.  Weird huh?
"Giddey joins the likes of Simmons, Jonah Bolden, Jalen Brunson and Dante Exum as sons of NBL dudes"
One of these days Dante Exum will finally be a star lol
Dante exum round 2
The next Dante Exum.
Dante exum 2.0
"If you’ve watched him, probably.  Dante Exum really worked at #5"
"Every year, we pretend that we know for sure which players are going to be good and which aren't. Every year there's guys we think are meaningless who turn out to be really solid. Every year, there's guys we thing are going to be really solid at the top of the draft that *totally* blow.   Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014 were really underwhelming for their hype. Dante Exum and Nik Stauskas straight up were terrible NBA players. They were the 5th and 8th picks.   But that's just one year, you might say...  2015: Jahlil Okafor, pick 3...had a lot of hype as a potential #1 overall guy a few months before the draft. Total bust. Mario Hezonja, pick 5? Worthless. Mudiay and Stanley Johnson, picks 7 and 8? Total crap.  2016: Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn in the top 5. Marquese Chriss and Thon Maker in the top-10.   2017: Fultz was a bust at 1. Josh Jackson was a bust at 4. Guys 8-11 were all crap.   You give each draft a few years, and you see that there are really good players drafted in the 20s each year, and some crap picked in the top-10."
"It means that the prospect is ready to contribute as a rookie. Most rookies these days aren’t considered NBA ready because they still have have a big weakness or big weaknesses in their game that can create havoc for them early on. Many rookie these days only have one season of college basketball experience or never had college basketball experience. I don’t have the data in front of me but it feels like more highly touted prospects end up busting nowadays than ever before because they were not ready for the league. (Ex: Mudiay, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Josh Jackson, even though he was actually a contributor with the Pistons this past season)."
"dante exum is 6'6, the hype coming in to the draft was luka doncic esque. although hampered by injuries"
Can someone please fire Dante Exum into the sun?  Ben Simmons left nut at the line every possession would still be better than the shit Exum's dished up every possession.
"Dante ""Ben Simmons"" Exum"
Dante Exum might just end up with more career injuries than career highlights…..
I’m going back to 2014 on this one. Dante Exum.
"I don't see the NBA being cut short. Too much money in it.   However, an annual international tournament after the NBA season is certainly possible. It's already half way there with the Olympics and world cup. It'll mean a lot of players will miss the off-season but to be honest, what better preparation will Ingles and Gobert have for the Jazz than playing for their national teams? And Dante Exum the other night was fantastic. I can't imagine he would get more from training."
"I’ve really enjoyed the Dante Exum experience, been a long time"
austrailia coach is right.  if dante exum drove to pass more he would be finding wide open guys
any jazz fans? did dante exum always struggle with weight issues?
I was on the Dante Exum hill for a long time. Really like his game
"I thought Dante Exum was going to be a legit starting PG in the NBA, injuries played a huge part but just seems like he could never get it together.   &amp;#x200B;  Also, OJ Mayo wasn't a bust I guess, but I expected him to be much better"
"[serious] if Dante exum grows  a Lowry sized ass, could he make a comeback?"
