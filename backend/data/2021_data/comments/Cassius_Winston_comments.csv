"Seeing as he just had his best game of the season and is finally attacking the basket, yes. I'd also rather Westbrook play than Cassius Winston."
"Isaac Bonga, Cassius Winston, Moe Wagner and 2 2nd round picks should do it imo."
"&gt; Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len  oh my fucking god"
"We missing like 6 key guys lol ... Beal was playing with a bunch of bad players who shot worse than him.   Like do you want Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len taking those shots instead?  Neto, Lopez, and Matthews are probably the only players there that may get playing time if the team is healthy."
You guys have Cassius Winston too. I watched him from extreme close distance for the past 4 years. He should be good enough to play some minutes eventually.
Cassius Winston time?
And take care of my guy Cassius Winston too
I just realized he’s not Cassius Winston.
"Never heard of him, first thing that came to mind was cassius winston, and I was like that dude is the most unathletic dude I've ever seen"
"Same, been a fan since college, thought he was one of those “he’s probably going to go in the 2nd round because he’s undersized but he’ll end up a very good player”. I feel the same about Cassius Winston"
"Cam Reddish went 10th too, and Tre Young went 41st the next year. That starting lineup was absurdly stacked.   But they didn't have Cassius Winston."
"It's because they don't play the goat, Cassius Winston."
"If you don't have any affiliation with the University you root for then I can't say I'd understand why you'd watch other than for the love of the game.   I wasn't that into CBB before I went to MSU, but I attended every home game from 2016-2020 and that changed things to say the least. Pretty cool to see Miles Bridges, Jaren Jackson Jr, Xavier Tillman, and Cassius Winston up close and share a little community with my fellow students."
Didn't Cassius Winston do that like two years ago. Pretty sure Luke Babbitt is on the list too so it doesn't really mean anything.
Bruh Cassius Winston played at most 20 seconds. Cmon man.
Cassius Winston known for getting decked by Russ in pregame intros
I don't think drafting players like Admiral Schofield or Cassius Winston ... is much better than trading away 2nds
He’s currently Worstbrook. I have him right above Bertans and right below Cassius Winston
Tillman is a rookie but is married with two kids and is a senior. JJJ has been in the league longer but Tillman is still older. Him and Cassius Winston could have won the National title in 2020 if the pandemic didn’t hit
put in Cassius Winston please Scott Brooks
The way the fouls are going this will have to be the Cassius Winston game.
"This is getting tangential but I have to chime in, the one time I disagree with you about Zion being the smartest guy on the court at Duke was when they got booted from the tournament by Michigan State. Cassius Winston was the smartest guy on the floor in that game. He picked apart a Duke team that had 4 future NBA players and 3 top-10 draft picks, he had the ACC DPOY guarding him all game and he still dropped a 20 point / 10 assist game. Tom Izzo said he might be the best decision-maker to ever play in the state of Michigan, which is high praise considering Magic was an MSU alum."
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner.

As a MSU Spartan fan there is only one and his name is Cassius Cash Money Winston aka Old Man Cash
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."

"Cassius Winston comes to mind, my favorite college player ever but his ceiling is a high quality backup in the league."
Our team got covid fucked in summer league so bad omens for the rest of the year... Or at least for Cassius winston
Cassius Winston
"It’s cuz of that damned 3 year 2-way contract. Players progress at an absurd rate in the G-League, so both he and Cassius Winston wind up at like 85+ minimum"
"Did he? He was absolutely able to be a role player on a Cassius team, but Cassius Winston was an all time college floor general. His FT percentage isn’t great, his offense is streaky, he was asked to lead the team and couldn’t really do anything until the late season Watts/Henry breakthrough. Even then, they lost to Maryland and UCLA pretty quickly right after. Literally beyond good defense in college and improved playmaking, I didn’t see any particular improvement. Was the least bad player on Tom Izzo’s worst team in 23 years."
"Yeah, the move is another 6'0 washout. We've got 2 rostered, just need 1 more  Who's keeping track from just the past 2 seasons? I am....  Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Cassius Winston, Chris Chiozza, Justin Robinson, Shabazz Napier, now Aaron Holiday."
Well last year Cassius Winston went #53 and according to Spotrac he signed a 1 year contract and was getting paid $1.48 million.  So I guess if he doesn't get a new deal then he would get less than $2 million from an NBA team (I'd assume he would be able to be able to at least play in some overseas league if he wanted to).

"The fans who are going to be watching Nate Hinton, Caleb Martin, Cassius Winston, and Sharife Cooper duke it out? Yeah, they'd deserve that prize money tbh"
I tell everyone how Cassius Winston but up 35 against me as a 4th grader when I was in 5th grade. They let him play for his team (UD Jesuit) a year early cause he was that good. Used to have the funniest looking jumper ever that somehow always went in
"I know that he shot well in college but he wasn’t aggressive with it and all of those attempts came on wide open shots that were created because of high ball screen and pops.   Because Cassius Winston was such a good collegiate player with miles bridges taking a lot of the heat from the defense opposing teams were pretty much fine with JJJ shooting those since he was hesitant to ball hog a lot.  Like I said the potential for him to take off in the nba was always there, but there just wasn’t a big sample size since he was a reluctant shooter which is why he got benched in the March madness tourney. (Even though that was a bad decision haha!)"
