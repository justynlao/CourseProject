"Well... yeah. Our offense completely opens up when anyone gets their shot going. We have a multitude of guys who could be our lead scorer on any given night. But I dont think Devonte is able to get people going as  quickly or as often as LaMelo. If its Devonte taking the ball up the court, he either passes it away and gets in position (which he is good at), he drives and pulls out of the paint and resets, or he takes a bad shot. Im not gonna try and claim that LaMelo doesn‚Äôt take bad shots or that he doesn‚Äôt make stupid plays while driving, but he provides another serious threat to drive at the basket, which creates more spacing for shooters like Hayward, Monk, Bridges, Graham, or Washington (hell maybe even a Martin twin if the stars are aligned) to go to work."
Flashback to posts/comments on LaMelo scoring 0points on debut and people calling him a flop straight away and saying he's only rated because of the 'Ball' name.
Warriors should trade Steph for lamelo ball and trade oubre for lonzo and fire Kerr and hire lavar
Bruh give me Lamelo Ball or Anthony Edwards over wiseman any day. The center position is a really difficult place to thrive for young players because you need a Man‚Äôs body to bump around and score and rebound. Wiseman thin. We need thicc bodied centers.
"Well, there was that LaMelo Ball post that was recently revisited."
&gt;Lamelo Ball  same here
1. Anthony Edwards  2. James Wiseman  3. Lamelo Ball  4. Patrick Williams  5. Isaac Okoro  We're 20 games into these guys' career and none of them have looked like they don't belong. Wait at least a year before you try to bring up this discussion.
Lamelo Ball
I remember people were posting LaMelo Ball lowlights from preseason.  Do people still post lowlights after he loses or plays bad? Seems to be a lot of folks who didn't like him.
Thank you. People act like LaMelo made our coach change his tactics. JB had us moving the ball around already.

"I think Lamelo is clearly in the lead. I haven‚Äôt heard many say Haliburton is the clear leader at this juncture. And I wasn‚Äôt saying Lamelo is the only legitimate candidate, but I do believe others will have to do more if they want to catch him to have a ‚Äúlegitimate shot.‚Äù I think you‚Äôre misconstruing and not comprehending there. They‚Äôre all legitimate candidates, but if they have a reasonable shot is a different statement.  The only reason Melo can‚Äôt stay on the floor is coaching. He outperforms the other guards on the Forster. Sure, he has turn overs but he‚Äôs looking to set up.  And not everything is stats. If you can‚Äôt use your eyeballs and see that Lamelo is more dynamic, you‚Äôre a robot.   But since you want to keep talking about efficiency and stats, here you go. Haliburton doesn‚Äôt even lead rookie‚Äôs in PER. Furthermore, his PER is worse than Ball‚Äôs.  Quickley: 18.85 Ball: 17.63 Haliburton: 16.18 Wiseman: 15.38 Edwards: 9.70"
"no shame in losing to LaMelo Ball, dont be shy jimmy"
"the hornets are winning despite lamelo ball, and not because of him"
Is anyone really aspiring to be the wolves front office? Lamelo has also just shown more so far he has literally been the main reason for some of their wins.   At least GS have Wiseman a shot at the starting spot. Hornets got devonte graham in over him isn't he on an expiring are they really gonna resign him while having Terry and lamelo plus Hayward is a ball handler.
LaMelo Ball going for 50/20/15 tonight
Lamelo ball
"As long as Lamelo Ball doesn‚Äôt start then someone else will have a chance to win the award . He‚Äôs not even promised 30 minutes a game despite outproducing both starting Guards . Read that again, LaMelo‚Äôs production off the bench outproduces the starting backcourt in like half the games played already"
"LaMelo Ball is averaging 6.1 assists and 2.5 turnovers per game while Anthony Edwards is averaging 1.8 assists and 1.8 turnovers per game in similar minutes. LaMelo Ball isn't just ""being flashy"", he's a playmaker that has shown really good ability to run an offense in limited minutes. Anthony Edwards isn't playing more fundamental basketball just because he's a scorer first (who by the way is barely averaging more points while being less efficient from the field).  In limited minutes LaMelo Ball shows a positive impact in every single advanced stat that exists while being a point guard learning how to run an offense which is rare for a rookie. Anthony Edwards is currently (only a rookie I understand) negatively impacting the game according to any stat available to public."
"Pleasant: LaMelo Ball for sure. I was expecting a disaster of inefficient shot launching, being very ball dominant, lack of effort on defense, and LaVar Ball losing his mind that Melo wasn't starting over Graham/Rozier. I'm happy to admit I was wrong about *most* of that. Still a long way to go, but the tools are definitely there.  Unpleasant: Honestly... I'd have to reach to shit on any of our players aside from the Martin Twins, who basically are who we thought they were- fringe rotation guys who can sometimes give you a boost but sometimes be total shit. I'm most disappointed in James Borrego's unwillingness to stop playing so much damn zone, and that it took him almost 15 games to give Malik Monk the light of day. To nobody's surprise, Monk has been far better than a Martin could dream of being."
Imagine if they'd have taken Lamelo and had the ball brothers with the splash brothers. That would've been pretty nasty.
"ugliest shooting form nominees: Tyrese haliburton, Lamelo ball, ja morant"
The Bucks aren't any worse if you replace Giannis with Siakam. Lamelo Ball has peaked. Kemba is finished because of his knee. Timberwolves passed on generational talent in James Wiseman for a 6th man (Anthony Edwards). Sexton wins the MVP in this next 5 years. Luka is faaaaaaat. Ty Lue wins his second title.
"&gt; High school ball is the time to make some mistakes and learn from them. Its also when kids start to develop their defensive fundamentals, and Melo isn‚Äôt getting any of that by cherry picking and shooting whenever he wants.  Which was what he was getting at Chino Hills when Lavar pulled him out. The other reason this take was wrong was that the JBA world tour was against European Youth and B teams.  The talent on those teams were as good or better than any HS or AAU competition Lamelo would find in the states."
"Oh, I thought this was a thread about the GOAT Lamelo ball"
"Well I do. And I‚Äôm being tame with my generational , I would say Lamelo is a transcendent TALENT. I think he will win MVPs and all the awards (can‚Äôt speak for chips as of yet , that‚Äôs a team/FO thing). Ben Simmons is a generational talent are you out of your mind? Dude is a multiple time all star with no jumpshotü§£ü§£  I think all the players you mentioned are generational TALENTS that can turn out to be generational PLAYERS . It‚Äôs my opinion that Lamelo happens to be a Unicorn . If his name was Jackson instead of Ball he‚Äôd get much more respect imo"
Immanuel Quickley     LaMelo Ball                                         ü§ù   Exciting rookies that need to start
"As a self professed Russ ""hater"", I can try to explain why. It's because he plays the game in a way that doesn't meet his skillset. Russ does a lot of things well and some things at an elite level. The problem is that he chooses to ignore those things in favor of doing things that he isn't good at which just makes no sense. Russ has never shot better than 34.3% from 3 during his MVP season. And yet over the past 4 seasons, he's shooting 4.5-5 three per game at a 30% rate. That's roughly 150/166 if you were to just extrapolate that to this year. That's on par with Cousins and LaMelo. Alternatively, there's also the narrative (which may or may not be overblown) that he is simply a bad off-ball player. He needs the ball in his hands to be an active part of the offense. Otherwise, he's just disengaged since he clearly isn't a 3 point threat. A lot of people don't like guys who play like that.   You compare him to someone like CP3. Now, does everyone like CP3? Hell no. Some people hate the dude. But CP3 has always played to his strengths and he plays smart. He's a brilliant passer, he keeps the turnovers low, he plays defense with effort and he isn't a liability anywhere on the court.   It essentially comes down to the fact that Westbrook plays ""dumb"" basketball by choice that people don't like him. Or at least that's why I don't like the way he plays. Do I hate him for it and make it personal? No. But he's one of very few players I find frustrating to watch because he basically goes against everything that you're taught about both fundamentals and how to play effective basketball. Can you imagine Russ on the Spurs or the Celtics or the 2014 Atlanta Hawks? And I get that Russ brings something different that people like but it's going to be controversial."
Sabonis still shook from being dunked on by Lamelo Ball üêê
"all I'll say is ""LaMelo Ball"" sounds like a really bad name for a fictional basketball player"
"Still better than any team Giannis has beat except for maybe the dysfunction 2019 Celtics with the most toxic player/saboteur in the NBA at the time.  And who says Giannis even wins that series comfortably? He doesn't fit as well as AD does with certain teams due to his nonexistent spacing &amp; offensive versatility, so it may make it much easier for the Blazers to clamp him and change the tide in those close finishes in that series  Hell, Giannis has Jrue now, along with Middleton, and is struggling to beat LaMelo Ball and Gordon Hawyard, and the regular season is where he feasts. Come playoff time... we'll see"
Very true but Lamelo is very good at defending too and very young. Jury like Simmons was. Ball though has that killer mentality and actually plays offense. Ball is gonna be amazing.
I remember one thread about LaMelo where a guy said he's faced better competition than pretty much all other high school and college prospects by playing in Lithuania and Australia  which is an undeniable fact and he got downvoted to hell   The LaMelo Ball discourse on here was NASTY a few years ago. Glad he's balling and proving people stupid
"I don't give a shit about Lonzo Ball man I don't have a horse in this race, but I made a thread to get more opinions cause I really don't see how Graham is more impactful to winning  I've watched multiple Hornets games because of LaMelo Ball and I don't have a reason to be bias either way. Graham simply is not a good player"
"Graham is not that good and should lose his starting spot at any minute. 30/30 teams take Lonzo Ball, Lonzo has a TS of 50 while Graham is at 47.  You can take literally any advanced stat and they all give Lonzo Ball the edge. You can accuse me of not watching games (which I do cause of LaMelo) but there‚Äôs no way every single advanced stat is wrong.  I don‚Äôt give a shit about either, Lonzo Ball is unquestionably a better player then Devontae Graham"
"Lol I remember all the ""why is lamelo going top 3"" ""DAE think lamelo inefficient shot chucker"" ""lavar ball bad"" posts before the draft from this subs armchair analysts, happy to see him prove y'all wrong"
Betting odds as of earlier this week   https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/nba-rookie-of-the-year-odds-update-lamelo-ball-tyrese-haliburton-james-wiseman-01ex0a09qq18
"&gt; People might not remember that this was during the stretch where like half of all basketball content in the media and on the internet was about the Balls  Maybe this thread specifically was, but as recently as literally weeks ago after LaMelo was already drafted a large portion of this sub was still downvoting any positive comments or analysis about LaMelo and still saying he's overhyped. Virtually every front office and draft analyst all had him as a consensus top 3 pick in the NBA draft, several having him at number 1, and redditors were still on here saying only Ball family dick riders thought he would be any good."
The hate for Lavar Ball made everyone want to root against LaMelo.
"this subreddit is complete ass but tbf there are some level headed takes in that thread that were upvoted   the very top comment was  &gt; LaMelo‚Äôs got the potential but his father has screwed up his developmental years. The kid was a 5 star prospect when he was in high school but in the JBA he‚Äôs basically playing on the Harlem Globetrotters at this point.  &gt; I‚Äôve got no idea how he‚Äôs supposed to improve when no one is actually coaching him and everybody else in the league sucks. High school ball is the time to make some mistakes and learn from them. Its also when kids start to develop their defensive fundamentals, and Melo isn‚Äôt getting any of that by cherry picking and shooting whenever he wants.  He ended up finishing up his senior year at a good school like spire, when to the Australian league and fully realized his potential. that comment wasn't too unfair    another comment with 500 upvotes  &gt; LaMelo has the potential.  &gt; LiAngelo is that small, old great player in the gym that thinks he can play in the NBA.  &gt; Also, it frustrates me that he got a scolarship at UCLA but fucked it up some unbelievably petty thing."
"Some(like me) just were dubious because most first round draft picks have proven themselves over and over against top competition while LaMelo took a different route.   Also, this is reddit. Slight criticism, no matter how logical, is transformed into ""HE HATES LAMELO BALL!!"" It happens way too much.   Of course there are some dumb haters, but they're usually downvoted to infinity in most threads but a lot of people like to take these few comments and warp them into ""entire thread hating"".   Hot tip: any shitty comment hating without giving logical reasons are comments you should *ignore*."
"They slept on Lamelo Ball, but now they're mirin LaMagic Ball."
"it shows that pre-conceived notions about players are sometimes just extremely wrong. LaMelo is a high effort player on both ends. He pushes the pace so hard, he's always pressuring the ball when his man has it, he denies the ball when his man doesn't have it. He gets back quick after he turns it over. He is an absolute PEST out there. Anyone who hates on his effort hasn't watched him play straight up"
But lamelo doesn‚Äôt even turn the ball over that much? Is there more because I feel like he was harping more on the defense

Ok but is Malachi Flynn better than Lamelo Ball?
Lamelo Ball is a fken weapon man he‚Äôs going to be so fken good.
**LAMELO BALL IS LEGIT.**
you just got dominated by LaMelo Ball sit your ass down
"He‚Äôs going to be a bonafide star in this league. He‚Äôs truly incredible at the rim, which separates him from his older brother and is why I‚Äôm a lot higher on Lamelo. He doesn‚Äôt need to be shooting great to still put the ball in the hoop."
LaMelo Ball is probably going to be the best Hornet ever. You can already see it.
"Lamelo made so many clutch plays, no real turnovers either, he got one off a travelling violation when they were jus holding the ball wit 21 seconds left"
"Lamelo Ball? That Big Baller Brand-descent love cannon? Yeah I know him. The girth on display from this man has no rival. He slaps rims, throws dimes and makes love like a stallion. The man oozes testosterone. Wherever he goes the air crackles with sexual energy. Yeah I know Lamelo Ball, and now you do too."
"LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, WELCOME TO THE LAMELO BALL SHOW"
Add Lamelo Ball to the list of players who get a better whistle than Giannis...
Lmao he's basically rookie LaMelo Ball
Did sabonis suddenly grow a back made of brick and mortar? Far as I know as long as Lamelo doesn‚Äôt yeet the ball at sabonis it won‚Äôt go far
&gt; Or he missed him then touched the ball first. That would be a violation  how fast do u think lamelo is lol
A good Lamelo Ball is good for the league
"Both ball brothers are pretty good in catching the rebounds, lamelo is more on the explosive side"
"Such a watchable player.   Interesting to see the difference in players new to the league who are converted athletes who have played little to no competitive basketball before, and have to be baby-stepped while they get used to the game, and someone like this, who clearly has absolutely lived and breathed it since birth - with a touch of younger brother syndrome for that extra ‚Äúno fear playing with the big boys‚Äù too.   Also funny that LaMelo can hit any circus pass he wants with his eyes closed but nearly misses bonging the ball off a 7 foot dude from a metre out."
But people on instagram told me Lamelo Ball is going to be unanimous
So are raptors fans still crying about Lamelo Ball getting more media coverage than malachi flynn?
"Lonzo ""LaMelo Ball"" Ball"
"OP left out my favorite part where our announcer followed this up by saying ""LAMELO BALL WITH SOME SERIOUS YEAST"" lmao.  Our announcers are GOATed tbh"
"Right but with the emergence of Lamelo and Devontae it really does cover a lot of his weaknesses. When we signed him i thought him as starting PG would be bad, but as an off ball SG he is excellent, his catch and shoot numbers are insane."
Lamelo Ball....  He's gonna attract great players who wanna play with a really talented unselfish PG. Huge for Charlotte.
"Ball reminds me of Josh Smith, a coach (IIRC) told him to not shoot 3s one season and that was his best season.  LaMelo should do the same"
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
He‚Äôs gonna come back so skinny that even lamelo ball can post him up
 Is ball watching like that on the second play a usual thing for Lamelo?
"I am not a LaMelo fan, but he is averaging 11, 6 and 6 in 24 minutes per game.    It is close between the 3 of them.  Wiseman had a great game last night, which could help move him up.    Ball got off to the best start, but he hasn't played well for the past 5 games.  I would still put him 1 or 2, but he is trending to drop to 3 or lower."
"yeah which is why Lamelo gets dusted on ball lol height hurts later quickness, that's why guys like Bam are freaks."
Lamelo ball? We can‚Äôt call him melo now that name is taken.
"half the sub watch ball, the other half plays ball/ lamelo will be a top player. you don't come into the league with a vision like that unless you gifted."
Lamelo Ball lol

Bulls broadcast really said that LeBron is doing a Lamelo Ball with that pass lol
Did this Bulls commentator really just compare LeBron to LAMELO BALL are you kidding me lmao
mfer really comparing lamelo ball to lebron james?
"I'll be the first in line to say I was wrong about lamelo ball. Never expected him to have this kind of game sense so early. And yeah, like hayward said, what struck me is how much it reminded me of luka."
"Melo went from LMAO Ball to being hyped and now nobody talks about him because he's been below average.  I still don't understand the Ball brothers. Lonzo was ass shooting, then he was starting to shoot well in NOLA, went to the bubble, he was ass and a couple of days ago there were rumors about him being traded.  Lamelo is really aggressive, I've seen really good passes from him, really athletic. He goes 4/5 from 3pt line and then 0/6; he goes 15FGA to 3FGA. He looks confident and then he's sloppy; he's flashy and then he vanishes (Although I've watched the last games from him, maybe he was better)"
**Stars with a good shot**  AD/Giannis/Joker/Luka/Simmons/Sabonis  **Very good players with a shot**  Draymond Green/LaMelo Ball/Lonzo Ball/Clint Capela/Andre Drummond/Dejounte Murray/Myles Turner  **Maybe somehow if they get play time (even if it is extremely unlikely)**  Elfrid Payton/Rajon Rondo
"That‚Äôs not a good way to look at it though, it‚Äôs looking at them all as assets. LaMelo ball is (I believe) a net-negative player this year, but definitely a very valuable player and has good long term potential. Maxey not being a positive player yet doesn‚Äôt make him a scrub."
"Bro I live in the Bay Area and LaMelo Ball is more popular here, in what world is Wiseman more popular right now? LaMelo Ball was the 3rd pick also"
lamelo literally played a season of pro ball against grown men...
When Lamelo is in he‚Äôs been sticking with the zone. I feel like Ball moves his feet well enough to play man and gets rebounds and steals well.. but I guess they think he‚Äôs going to get abused on screens/mismatches. But the centers accounted for 3 of his 5 turnovers I believe.. right off their hands. Makes melo look bad with the statline
Well they definitely made a mistake for not drafting Lamelo ball with the number one pick. Too bad for them
Yep he was a beast on offense. Was cooking our smaller wings and was very aggressive. Too bad devonte Graham had like 2 pts in the second half and Terry rozier had 0 in the first and lamelo ball had 5 turnovers with the game's worst -15
"Did Lamelo Ball sleep with James Borrego's wife during the course of the game or what? Cody zeller lack of awareness gave Ball a turnover and Lamelo just got benched immediately lol, for the rest of they game!!  Also, Stacey King is a treasure"
"I think Lamelo had the benefit of watching his brothers struggles in the nba and do everything he could to round himself out sooner. Lamelo is already a better ball handler, playmaker, and finisher. Lonzo literally only has shooting, and Lamelo isnt bad at that either."
LaMelo Ball is who Lonzo should think he is
"It‚Äôs not moronic tho. We‚Äôre literally watching the reemergence of the big men in the NBA. Hell the top 2 of 3 in the MVP race is a center. The warriors have no depth at that position. They were good when they had big men on the floor. Bogut, Zaza, Lee, etc... Looney hasn‚Äôt been 100% for a while. I don‚Äôt think your going anywhere in the post season playing small ball. Plus with or without Lamelo they‚Äôre not going to Finals this year. So that gives you a training period till Klay comes back next year."
"Did you just call Lamelo a ball dominant PG who doesn‚Äôt facilitate the ball? Clearly, last time you watched Lamelo play was when he was a freshman at Chino Hills"
"Since entering the starting lineup, LaMelo is hitting 45% on 6.5 threes per game...so he's not exactly useless off-ball.   Also, there are 15 minutes a game that Steph doesn't play.   Also, Steph turns 33 in a week. Lightening his load in the regular season as a creator is of paramount importance.   So, as always when people bring up fit to explain leaving better players on the board...your concerns are unfounded.  Also, Steph happens to be spectacular off-ball."
"Lamelo can play off ball, and be the primary initiator with Steph is out of the game. He could have been part of the death lineup 3.0.  Instead they picked wiseman when he is probably 2-3 years from being good. The time for the warriors to win is within the next 3 years. Wiseman doesn‚Äôt line up with that. You could argue that Lamelo was thought to have needed more time as well, but that has been shown to be wrong."
Lamelo ball trainer is former nba player Jermaine Jackson who‚Äôs friends with Jalen
"Drafting for fit is moronic for a normal lottery team because they don‚Äôt have any talent to fit with.   We have Steph, Klay and Dray and a system that doesn‚Äôt not facilitate a ball dominant pg.   People who said we should‚Äôve drafted Lamelo are either advocating we waste his talent by playing him in a position where we don‚Äôt utilise his strengths or we relegate him to a bench role for his whole career and get him to lead the second unit.   Wiseman as a slightly less talented but much better fit prospect was the much better choice"
especially bc lamelo would fit fine on the warriors   i‚Äôd be really surprised if an organization as clearly smart as the warriors did that. they were a huge part of why small(er) ball became popular. drafting a 7‚Äô1 big that might have defensive issues seems pretty antithetical to that
I think something got lost or exaggerated in translation. I‚Äôm gonna guess the conversation in GS was ‚Äúif the Wolves take Wiseman over Edwards we‚Äôre going Lamelo‚Äù but it was miscommunicated to the Ball camp by a third party the night of the draft.
"exactly, people are so impatient. Lamelo has been playing pro ball for like 3 years now? Wiseman has looked very solid, and other than his current lack of play time I think he's in a great situation to learn and grow.  kind of why Luka come in so crazy good as a rookie, played against grown men for years before getting drafted."
"#Lamelo Ball, guard for the Charlotte Hornets"
"I mean yeah, we have bad ownership but if the lottery balls went any better for us, we could‚Äôve m had guys like Zion Williamson, Lamelo Ball, and other guys. No one talks about it because it‚Äôs better to just laugh at us but we [have historically bad lottery luck ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/dailyknicks.com/2020/08/21/ny-knicks-worst-lottery-luck-nba-history/amp/)"
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn‚Äôt have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year‚Äôs. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte‚Äô Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We‚Äôve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he‚Äôs definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he‚Äôs still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We‚Äôre still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we‚Äôre young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we‚Äôve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
"They are exactly in a position to fill need? They are in contention for 4-5 seed, with great guard play, an all star caliber wing, and depth everywhere but c, yes Mitch said they aren‚Äôt in that position to fill need before the draft but ALOT has changed since then, lamelo turned out to be a steal and potential super star, we signed Gordon Hayward, terry rozier broke out, and we planted ourselves clearly in the playoff picture. There is no need to trade for ball if he really wants to play with his brother he can join In the offseason without costing assets"
"can people please stop with the Lonzo to Charlotte stuff. Dude's going to get massively overpaid, and as it stands he'd probably be our 4th or 5th best guard. We are S T A C K E D at guard and have no bigs.   Also, I'm happy that LaMelo is attracting attention to the team and all that, but I want nothing to do with a full on LaVar Ball media circus, which would inevitably happen if the two good Ball brothers teamed up. Things are better when drama is low key around here."
"as someone else posted, not true  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2020-nba-draft-prospect-rankings-final-big-board-of-cbs-sports-top-100-pro-prospects/  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/11/17/21561225/nba-mock-draft-2020-timberwolves-warriors-lamelo-ball"
"Idk who will end up being better but GSW could really use LaMelo. I mean, they always run Steph+Dray, 2 guys that can actually handle the ball and make plays, for 12min straight then rest. When the bench players come in (ala Wannabreaker) GSW offense go into headless chicken. Now you tell me LaMelo won't help that? He won't help next few years having constant offenses with Curry-Klay-Wiggs-Dray?"
"Why not? Lamelo's skill set and playstyle suits the warriors perfectly and he would allow the Warriors to maximize Curry both on and off ball.   There is zero reason to think that Lamelo could thrive alongside Rozier and Monk but he wouldnt be able to fit with Steph and Klay. People are just clinging to pre draft narratives about him being a non shooter and bad teammate. Based off what we have seen in the NBA, there is no reason to suggest he wouldnt thrive in GS."
&gt;he was the consensus number #1 pick      Yeah no.    https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2020-nba-draft-prospect-rankings-final-big-board-of-cbs-sports-top-100-pro-prospects/       https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/11/17/21561225/nba-mock-draft-2020-timberwolves-warriors-lamelo-ball
"Couple things:  Hornets: I find that the hornets are interested in Vucevic to be fascinating. I applaud the Hornets for saying hey, we have a young player and rather than standing pat and trying to build through the draft, let's be aggressive and surround LaMelo with some other pieces. I think there's a lot of value in trying to build around a young player even tho by time he reaches the end of his rookie contract, guys like Hayward and Vucevic will be past their prime. The question is, what is the cost and what are they willing to give up? I think they have enough contract filler but you'd have to imagine they have to throw in a young piece and a first.   Wolves: they've needed a PF for some time now and the pieces they're interested in are young and can be good defensive pieces. Again the question is cost, I can't imagine either of those players gets moved without a first coming back and I'm not quite sure either of those guys is good enough to move the needle out west and get them into play in game territory but they need to do something before KAT gets tired of them.   Dinwiddie: obvious piece to be traded from the moment they acquired Harden. They have no use for a guy like that who can't shoot or play defense who's making double digits to come off the bench. The question is, what should they trade him for? I would trade him for Tucker, I don't care how redundant him might be with Green, I think he'd be a good front court piece to have for this year and then bring him back for one more year next year. Plays defense, can hit the corner three, won't ask for the ball, can rebound. That's the deal I would make if I'm the Nets.   Blake: what contender would want him? Doesn't play a lick of defense and is shooting 31% from deep. What do you do with that? I'm not saying he doesn't have value but I don't see any contender taking him or Cousins. At least not a serious contender."
"I don't think the inflation angle is valid, as it applies to anything that's traded.  A LaMelo Ball rookie card doesn't water down the value of a LeBron rookie card. I don't believe they're duplicating the exact same moments.  The risk of the platform itself is perfectly valid though. It's a huge risk."
Westrbrook.  Lamelo.  Any ball dominant guard who feasts on from-behind blocks and jumps the passing lanes.
"A lot of other folks need to apologize. I really wanted the Wolves to swindle a trade and draft Lamelo and get some like Bridges with the #1 pick. I'll be honest I was sad when Silver sad Anthony Edwards. Still early , but I cant keep lying to myself saying Edwards is better than Ball"
Stark difference in the Hornets offense when they give Lamelo the ball vs when Malik Monk starts the possession.
"The international team is led by RJ Barrett and Lugentz Dort.  The domestic team is led by Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, and LaMelo Ball.  Send you prayers to the international team, because they need it!"
"Personally, I've always been a believer in pushing athletes to compete at the highest level they possibly can.   If you can hang in the G League, you should be there instead of college.  There's nothing that will improve your game more than playing against top competition.  I think soccer has the right idea with academies that bring young talent along at whatever speed they can handle.  Superstars like Kylian Mbappe rocket up to the highest level because they prove themselves at every step.  Same can be said for teenagers who make their way to to MLB like ARod.   Basketball should be looked at the same way IMO.  Luka and LaMelo are showing the value of playing pro ball and pushing yourself at a young age."
Someone has to say it:  LaMelo Ball.  :-)
To be fair it was widely regarded as a weak draft so the fact that a handful of picks look as good as those guys do is pretty surprising.  The only people who had LaMelo looking as good as he does were the like sycophants who just live to stan the Ball family and it was the weirdest intersection of the off-season.
Nice but for some reason I'm more impressed by Miles Bridges' alley-oop dunks from Lamelo so far - like the extension/motion of his arms when catching and stuffing the ball.
I like ant but it‚Äôs kinda hard to watch him when lamelo ball is actually dominating
Lamelo is lamelon ball
"Nah, I was a BBB hater of Lavar, Lonzo and Gelo until I watched Melo. Then I became a fan because my favorite type of player is Kyrie/Iverson, handles with swag and LaMelo has that since Chino. He got me liking BBB after watching Ball in the Fam and shit.  Through out all that, I knew Lonzo is overhyped and Gelo is trash. and I was right."
"Is the NBA cursed? Almost everyone who has played in the NBA has either 1) gotten injured or 2) Lost in/missed the playoffs. Man this is spooky, starting to think the entire NBA except LaMelo Ball is cursed."
I wouldn't say so. Lamelo is more of an on-ball creator while Lonzo is insanely good off the ball. They'd fit perfectly together
"It's pretty hopeless to make sense of any rotation. Usually the end of the bench guys are vets who can mentor young players but ours are just more young players. I like what I see from McDaniels and Nowell but they probably are the only benefactors of being on such a shit team. In reality, they would probably be playing on two-way contracts for most teams.  Being completely realistic, Jaylen Nowell could not be any more one dimensional. Even on offense without the ball he just stands there. He looks good when he's hitting jumpers but when he's cold he is a complete negative.  Re: Anthony Edwards, I think he's exactly what people scouted and reported him to be: a charismatic athletic guard who can get to the rim and dunk but often has mental lapses and horrible shot selection. I hope he makes improvements but based on recent developments of other players (Culver, Okogie especially) it's hard to really get excited about any future with this team.  It especially sucks to see the roster that Rosas has built knowing he is nearing Kahn levels of winning %, and that we might have drafted the wrong guy (see: LaMelo), and we might be losing our draft pick to the Warriors."
I hope he ends up playing with his brother LaMelo at some point. Watching the Ball Brothers with Lamar sitting courtside would be all-time entertainment!
"Carmelo Anthony is Melo. LaMelo Ball might get called that sometimes, but the nickname is officially occupied in the NBA by a far more accomplished player. Mellow Melo will just be more confusing because it just sounds like you're saying his name twice. Apparently Hornets fans are using Melon, which could work. There's no need to force these nicknames, just call him Lamelo until something actually sticks."
"Maybe the Ball father wasn't wrong after all. as soon as LaMelo Ball got drafted and started torching these bums Lonzo elevated his level of play. Following this train of thought imagine what would happen if LiAngelo ""the steal god"" Ball was in the NBA, and if the three brothers were in the same team? Championship guaranteed. NEVA LOSS"
 &gt;2021 LaMelo Ball vs 2004 Carmelo Anthony (self.nba)   &gt; Carmelo had a pretty great **ROY-level season** (he just happened to be in the same year as LeBron so he never won the award).  &gt; LaMelo is on track to have a similarly great **ROY season.**  &gt; Which player was more promising **after 1 year in the NBA?**  ...
"Lamelo‚Äôs stock skyrocketed the last couple of years. I think a lot of people that didn‚Äôt follow him closely still thought he was the undersized, half court chucking Ball brother. For so many years, Lonzo was seen as the super-prospect of the family that a lot of people missed how good Lamelo became."
Lamelo has unrelenting confidence with how he plays.  I don‚Äôt think most rookies get over that mental hump when they get into the league.    They‚Äôve been killin‚Äô it their whole entire career .. (even If you‚Äôre a 2nd rounder.. you were still killing it in college) etc.   LaMelo had some adversity playing in leagues with older dudes.. but he‚Äôs always had fucking delusional confidence.. the only thing is.. he has the talent to back it all up.  I also think he just loves playing ball &amp; being out there.  Everyone loves him
"Black: One day I was sitting in my office at the Forum, and Jerry just pops his head into my office and says, ""Hey, come on, let's go, we got a workout, you gotta see this kid!"" In the summers the court inside the Forum would not be down because there would be concerts, hockey, the rodeo or whatever. So we worked out guys at Inglewood High and the Inglewood YMCA -- they were both like a minute car ride from the Forum. To me it was just Jerry being social, wanting to include other people in something he was excited about. I knew the names being bandied about that we were looking at, and Kobe wasn't one of them. It was just a chance to get out of the office.  Ryan West, son of Jerry West, Lakers front office, 2009-2019: The Inglewood YMCA was not the nicest gym in the world. It was probably 30 years out of date. It was small, not a full-sized court even, and it had a real homey feel to it. I've read a lot about the workouts and there has been a lot of misinformation about it. As time has gone by people have gotten the details mixed up about the order and the location of the workouts. But I'm blessed with a great memory and I drove him to the workouts and I remember it like it was yesterday. The first place where the story gets misconstrued is with Michael Cooper. He was the first workout. The other error is about Inglewood High. I specifically remember walking through the door with Kobe that day at the Inglewood YMCA.  Kupchak: Today you walk into a workout and there's trainers, strength and conditioning coaches, sports scientists, measurements, charting, all kinds of stuff. Back then, it was all pretty informal. I'm not even sure we had someone there to rebound the ball for him.  Ryan West: At the beginning they were running him through drills, and Kobe would just go to the rim and dunk every ball. My dad stopped the workout and said, ""Kobe, we know you can dunk. Let's see what else you can do."" He wanted to see him do other things rather than just tear the rim down every time. My dad wanted to see players put in situations they would find themselves in during NBA games. That's when you saw the pull-up game, the jump hooks, the floaters. Kobe had every shot in his repertoire. The Lakers had the recently retired Michael Cooper, who had been named DPOY in 1987, guard Kobe during his pre-draft workout. After just 20 minutes, Jerry West had seen enough. ""This kid is better than anybody we have on our team."" John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images  Black: Michael Cooper was 40 at the time, and he had been retired a few years but he was still a freak. Still wiry. Still in great shape. Cooper at 40 was like a normal person at 25. Larry Bird is on record saying Cooper was the most difficult guy he ever played against in his career, the toughest guy to ever defend him. And there's Jerry saying to him, ""Don't take it easy on this kid. Make him work as hard as you can.""  Michael Cooper, Lakers guard, 1978-1990: I thought I was going to go out there and whip his ass, to tell you the truth. That was my thought. I was like, OK, look, I don't give a f--- how old I am, I'm not gonna let some f---ing guy do anything.  And boy was I brought back to reality quick. In a hurry I found out that 40 and 17 don't go together on the court. At the very beginning, I got right in there and got my hands right up in his face. Guys hate that, especially young guys. He just rose up over my hand like I wasn't even there. I was planning on him not being that strong and that he'd be intimidated. This is an unfair comparison to this young man because I really like him, this LaMelo Ball kid in Charlotte, 19 years old he comes out to the NBA and you see his little, frail body -- Kobe didn't have that frail body at that age.  Carbone: The knock on Kobe in high school was even if he had the skills he was too skinny. I met him the summer of 1995, and Kobe trained that whole year and put on 10-15 pounds of muscle. His first visit to the Nets, the GM at the time, Willis Reed -- his hands are huge -- well he grabs Kobe around the upper arm and he's shaking him and he says, ""OK, you ain't so skinny.""  Black: Kobe never backed down from anyone, even at age 17. Kobe did not know how to be deferential. Michael was playing his best and Kobe just had his way with him. Kobe was just destroying him.  Raymond Ridder, current senior VP of communications, Golden State Warriors, Lakers PR staff, 1990-1998: I just saw Michael Jordan out there. Kobe had all the Jordan mannerisms: the fadeaway jumper, dribbling between his legs, tongue hanging out -- he had perfected every Jordan move at the age of 17.      ""I thought I was going to go out there and whip his ass, to tell you the truth. That was my thought. I was like, OK, look, I don't give a f--- how old I am, I'm not gonna let some f---ing guy do anything.""     Former Lakers guard and DPOY Michael Cooper, who guarded the 17-year-old Kobe  Cooper: There were certain things Jerry wanted to see. The big one was: Could he get to a spot? Great players can always get to their spot. Spots, and the angles you take to get there, are so important in basketball. You might not always hit the shot, but if you can get there, that's when you feel like you'll hit 8 out of 10, or 9 out of 10. Jerry requested that he get to an exact spot, say, at the elbow, every time. Not a foot away, not two feet away, not an inch away. Even the very best offensive players cannot get to that spot by just going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes you're gonna have to take me to A to C to F and then come back to B. So that was the first thing I admired about Kobe. I had done this, taken this away against Larry Bird, Dr. J, and a young Michael Jordan, and here's a young man fresh out of high school and I'm trying to deny him certain places on the court, and Kobe was able to get to his spot, I'd say, nine times out of 10.  Ryan West: They had him doing a particular play off a pick and roll where Kobe was the ball handler and he threw me a great pass, and I went up for the layup and completely bricked the layup. I was so embarrassed.  Cooper: One time Kobe comes off the screen and he got me pretty low so I ended up going under the screen. Now, a decent offensive player in the NBA would think, OK the defense is under the screen -- let me take one dribble past the pick and hit a jump shot. Sure, you could hit that shot, but that's the shot the defense wants to give you. He came off the screen, gave me a little pump fake, which rose me off my feet and gave him some room and then he drove -- one-two, bounce, dribble -- got to the elbow, rose up and hit the shot. Then he went to the left side and did the same thing.  Ridder: He wanted to do everything he could to destroy Michael Cooper. That mentality was something he had from day one, and you saw it in this workout. He had the mamba mentality at 17.  About halfway through the workout, legend has it that things began to heat up, with Kobe and Cooper talking trash and throwing elbows. Kobe was, after all, notorious for ruthlessly humiliating all challengers -- teammates, coaches, friends even -- in games of one-on-one. But the truth is Kobe was so dominant and relentless (at one point he hit 12 shots in a row from the baseline) the workout never even got competitive enough to become contentious.  That week in Los Angeles, Kobe was already shooting his first commercial. Even as a teenager he was a genius at building a brand and spinning his own mythology. Growing up a Lakers fan, he knew exactly who Michael Cooper was and, more importantly, what people around the NBA would say if he strolled into L.A. and destroyed one of the game's greatest defenders. So Kobe never said a word. He knew the workout would speak volumes on its own. In fact, the only chatter heard that day came from former Laker Norm Nixon, who tried to encourage Cooper by yelling, ""Bang on him, Coop! Bang on him!"" from the bleachers. It didn't help. Afterward, Nixon walked up to his old friend and whispered, ""The kid just kicked your ass.""  Cooper: He did kick me in the nuts one time with his leg, and I was mad about that. But that was it. I was banging on him. I was hitting him with my forearm and he was banging me right back. I hit him hard one time, in the kidney and it was a cheap shot, on purpose. It was just that he was backing me down, backing me down and so I hit him. He felt it, you could tell. I said, ""Hey man, sorry about that,"" but Kobe was so focused on the workout he was like, ""No, no, no problem, Coach, let's go."" When he'd hit me with an elbow he would say, ""Oh, oh, I'm sorry,"" and I said, ""Quit treating me like an old man."" But no, Kobe didn't talk. And it was a good thing. Jerry hated that. He always said, why are you fraternizing with the enemy out there? Why are you talking to the enemy when you should be trying to kick their ass? No, Kobe had one thing on his mind: He wanted to play in Los Angeles.  Jerry West: He just had that ""It"" factor. LeBron James, Magic Johnson, people like that, they just have it. Kobe had it. You could see it. You could feel it.  Cooper: When we moved to the low post, Jerry took off the restraints. Kobe didn't have to hit a certain spot or go a specific way anymore. So I didn't know what he was going to do. I was at his mercy. Left-hand hooks. One-bounce turnarounds. And he had that little shake shot, that little MJ shake with his back to the basket and that fall-away shot. And he was able to get up and get his shot off and sink it time after time after time. play 0:47 Kobe's early years: From high school star to the Lakers' gold  Take a look back at how Kobe Bryant went from high school phenom at Lower Merion to a teenage sensation early in his NBA career."
"Oh i said it was a failiure? i take that back, i didnt meant to say that. What i tried to say is that their style of play was bad and didnt help either of those guys develop a great understanding of the game, and that the 2 Ball brothers and Okongwu would have made the NBA wherever the fuck they play. Also that Lamelo learned far more playing overseas than in Chino Hills.   I also think you are looking at it from the wrong angle. Chino Hills was succesfull BECAUSE they had multiple top tier prospects and not the other way around. But you are fanboying this team for some reason, prolly an alumni."
"&gt;He made a smart, thought out, professional decision.  That's possible. It's also possible Lavar was just [pissed at UCLA](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/11/26/lavar-ball-lamelo-ball-ucla) for suspending LiAngelo.  &gt; ""Heck no, he won‚Äôt be at UCLA though ‚Ä¶ What? UCLA, why? After what they did to my other son? Are you crazy? After what they did to Gelo (LiAngelo Ball), you think I‚Äôm gonna go back? They messed that up. You don‚Äôt mess with none of my boys."" &gt;  &gt; LiAngelo was arrested for shoplifting while in China with the UCLA team in 2017. The interviewer appeared to be unaware of the incident, asking what UCLA did. While LaVar mentioned the suspension, he also said that LiAngelo was forced to wear No. 15 instead of No. 3."
Playing professional ball is more competitive and prepares guys more for the NBA. Obviously it doesn‚Äôt always work (Emmanuel Mudiay) but Luka and Lamelo are both extremely talented early on in their careers
"&gt;Carmelo Anthony on **LaMelo Ball also being called Melo:** ""LaMelo is going to be in the league for a long time **so you might as well use it. For me, it's an honor.""**  it also says that as clear as day in the post"
I can‚Äôt believe Lamelo is already this good. I was probably higher on him more than most but he‚Äôs already as good as Lonzo if not better. The game just comes way more naturally to him which is crazy. I thought he would get bullied way more in the league just because of how young and relatively skinny he still is. But dude can flat out ball and his shooting splits are impressive as hell.
"I think he cares a lot more now that he's in the NBA. Like going to the Illawarra Hawks was so he could ball out and get drafted to the NBA, and now that LaMelo is in the NBA, he's he's getting better coaching and he has better teammates around him. I think the most underrated part of this Hornet's team is their collective playmaking abilities. I mean LaMelo is already showing the potential to be one of the best playmakers in the league and Hayward and Devonte Graham are actually like good playmakers as well. Charlotte really was the best realistic landing spot for LaMelo."
LAMELO BALL DUMB ASS

"Its a bit unfair as Simmons is more seasoned than the other 2.  Simmons nets you a problem matchup, a DPOY candidate, and an excellent ball-handler/passer, and size. The configurations you can build around him are gonna be a lot easier to manage than the ones you can build around Lamelo/Morant.   So if I'm building a team from scratch I feel like he solves the most problems....that being said there are a few team configurations i'd choose the other guys over him - but they require a lot more specific personnel - where I'd want a perennial outside threat.   Like lets say Lamelo and Ja continue their trajectory, and you have to replace Donovan Mitchell in Utah... I'm not sure I pick Simmons then."
"I am going to need to see more than like 30 games of LaMelo before I put him ahead of Ja. At least get to the sophomore year so I can see if he regresses once teams figure out his play style and force him to evolve his game. We've seen a lot of players have good first years then fall off a cliff afterwards. Brandon Jennings, Tyreke Evans, Michael Carter Williams, I mean give it another year before I even consider LaMelo Ball."
LaMelo Ball is gonna end up being the best out of those three IMO
LaMelo Ball and Carmelo Anthony are each better than Kennard / Mbah a Moute without needing to be combined.
"Cade, he‚Äôs a less flashy but bigger stronger Lamelo ball, he‚Äôs been the consensus number one pick. Then guys like Mobley, kumimga, green, Suggs competing for #2"
"And this is the biggest difference between Lonzo and Melo. Dude decided he was gonna pass before he even got the ball despite the closest defender being \~10 feet away. On the contrary, LaMelo is pulling that 10 times out of ten with the ultimate confidence. Lonzo gonna be kicking himself when he watches this clip back."
imagine lamelo ball... instead of wanamaker.
JJ Redick = Eric Bledsoe / Lamelo Ball = Thanasis Antetokounmpo / Sam Merrill = DJ Wilson  any i missed?
"* Overrated: not really anyone is super overrated but it‚Äôs either Hayward or LaMelo. Both are good players, but have flaws. Hayward is good but seems to refuse to take over games and goes cold, two things he needs to avoid to put him in that caliber of ‚Äúgreat‚Äù player. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to be an All-Star, but he was discussed as a candidate and mentioned in some snub lists. Melo is fairly rated by most (good passer, acceptable shooter/defender, super high effort/energy) but the Ball stans waayyy overrate him.   * Underrated: Cody Zeller. I don‚Äôt think most neutrals realize how big an impact Cody has on this team. We need a C who can pass and move- that‚Äôs Cody. Over the past few years, whenever Cody has been out, we‚Äôve lost games. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs exceptional at any one skill, but I also don‚Äôt think he has any huge, glaring limitations. He‚Äôs just solid, reliable, a metronome relative to Biz‚Äôs stock market ticker."
"My girlfriend and I broke up because of lamelo ball.  We got in a huge fight over it because I was saying how beautiful lamelo is. The fight eventually spilled into other topics and it got really heated. In the heat of the moment I called her a ""Sixers fan"", and it was a wrap.  We dated for two years and were thinking about moving in together. At the time I thought she was the love of my life. And it ended over lamelo ball  And since all of my friends were also her friends, and she was closer friends with them than I was, they took her side. So I lost all my friends too.  My best friend called me a few hours after the argument and said he didn't want to hang out with me anymore because it would cause drama.  The only person I've talked to in like a week is my lamelo ball Plushie ."
"Right.  Looking back at 20 drafts between 1995 and 2015, we can see there is a clear drop-off in the likelihood of getting an allstar player after the first pick in the draft.  * Pick 1 - 60% all stars * Pick 2 - 20% all stars * Pick 3 - 50% all stars * Pick 4 - 30% all stars * Pick 5 - 25% all stars  I'd note that a lot of these ""all-stars"" are one or two timers like Antawn Jamison and Stephon Marbury.  Weirdly enough the 3rd pick in the draft has produced some really great hall of famers including Melo, Pau, Harden.  Every third pick in the last five years (which I didn't include in my sample) has been an all-star or is very likely to become one (Barrett and LaMelo Ball)"
You yougins need to stop calling lamelo ball by the name of melo
A poor mans lamelo ball
"Some may disagree but what makes this Hornets team fun to watch is Borrego's system.. (ie. Pop's system from the Spurs). Derozan is averaging a career high in assists under Pop and the Hornets play the exact same way seeing as how Borrego learned under Pop. They all share the ball and it's a really good mix of playmakers with LaMelo, Hayward, Graham, and Terry leading the team in assists and all being willing passers. Scary Terry is probably the most score-first of the bunch along with Gordo.  It's a crazy departure from watching Kemba play hero ball all the time (granted there wasn't much around him) but thank god I don't have to watch isos non-stop these days...  The Celtics on the other hand look like the old Hornets. Just take turns getting theirs and don't necessarily play cohesively as a team. It feels like between the Jays and Kemba (albeit great players) they take some horrendous shots not within the flow of the game.  That's why on any given night you see Monk go off, or LaMelo, or Hayward, or Scarry Terry etc. Hornets are playing the right way and it can lead to anyone having a big night which as a fan is fucking awesome to watch. FINALLY!"
"I mean, that is by far an overstatement.  Edwards has no samples of play in his life that are comparable to LaMelo Ball's career so far.  Ball has been more impressive in his 30 NBA games than Edwards was in his 32 NCAA games.  Ball would be the no doubter first overall pick by every team in the league if there was a redraft.  Knowing what we know now, he is clearly the best prospect.  And plays the most coveted archetype - lead playmakers are more valued in the NBA than non-elite big men and scoring wings.  I think it is reasonable to acknowledge Ball would have been the better pick for Minny."
"Thank god for Hornets fans they fell to three and got saved from themselves.  I am still astounded the Warriors took Wiseman.  Any random role playing center would look good on that team, while LaMelo would be the perfect guard to fit their offense with ball movement and cutting.  LaMelo was almost the perfect prospect for the Warriors - imagine him and Steph playing together at the same time."

I get my draft opinions from watching the guys play and listening to experts  Which is why before they had even played a second of NBA ball I'd made numerous comments on here saying that edwards was the wrong choice and that LaMelo should be number one  Can't be knocking my opinions when I'm right so far lmao
"You see, they didn't select lamelo ball as a 1st pick, and instead they selected anthony edwards. Quite interesting, isn't it?"
"I think I‚Äôve gotta side with op here. Pretty much every rookie has a path to becoming a really good, productive nba player and you‚Äôre correct that for ant that is his athleticism and ability to get downhill (I would be hesitant to call him ‚Äúgood at attacking the basket‚Äù when he shoots less than 50% at the rim). What differentiates Lamelo is that he‚Äôs found a way to translate those skills into being a positive contributing player on a competitive team. That‚Äôs not to say ant can‚Äôt get there, or even pass Lamelo, but at this point Ball is much further along than edwards"
"Inefficient is a major issue. He wasn't efficient in college either. Who is to say that's going to change? His main skill is supposed to be scoring - what good is a scorer that can't score efficiently? Hint: not good.  And not passing is also a major issue. Passing is the most underrated skill in the nba.   They drafted Andrew Wiggins 2.0   Lamelo at least came in with 2 elite nba skills - passing and ball handling. And those are 2/3 of the most important things for a guard to do, the other being shooting.   There's nothing that edwards is elite at besides being athletic, and athletes are a dime a dozen"
I have decided that Lamelo Ball is the better player and should have been drafted first
"Yeah, that D'Lo trade looking like an abject catastrophe.   The D'Lo experience cost them their 2021 draft pick and LaMelo Ball. And it's a pretty bad experience to begin with, their team is bound to come in dead last for years to come with D'Lo at the helm."
Lamelo makes it look so easy when he plays. He plays with the ball on the string. He‚Äôs gonna be a superstar in this league 100%  Averaging 15/6/6 is pre damn good for a rookie
"bro imagine being a suns fan and somehow think you got fucked this game lmao! holy shit..... get real people. literally just off the top of my head.... lamelo getting tackled by 2 dudes shooting a 3 in the end of the first quarter, no call. miles bridges fouled on a putback dunk attempt no free throws, terry rozier scraped in the face no call, lamelo ball getting slapped in the face no call, egregious carry by chris paul directly in front of the ref no call, booker elbowing hayward in the face and getting rewarded, ball going out on saric and giving you the ball at the end of the game........ ok thats just off the top of my head"
"Wiseman and LaMelo on the same team? Juicy af.  I think the Warriors would like Hayward and Monk. That will also mean Oubre won't be re-signed coz Hayward is significantly better than Oubre, who is in turn better off searching for greener pastures if he wants major minutes to come with a better salary.  Ball - Rozier - Wiggins - Washington - Wiseman would be an intriguing lineup."
Mikal was great offensively and fine on-ball but he was putrid on help D. Jae too. And that made Ayton look like a fool getting left out on Lamelo island.
"Someone explain why the Mods, AGAIN, have deleted the Lamelo ball iso on Ayton at the end of the game.     It was a fantastic highlight with a fantastic title.  Just so sketchy"
"Agree. I don't get the fit talk at all for the Warriors, we seriously lack a second ball-handler who can actually penetrate past the perimeter, and the system is geared towards high IQ players. Even with Klay back, LaMelo can easily give this team 25+ minutes a night."
LaMelo Ball snubbed first overall pick
I think people like watching Zion. I'm not denying that.  But I think it's also disingenuous to not notice the massive drop off in his promotion on social media. I see LaMelo Ball a billion more times than anything Zion related this year. Which is odd because the only person who appeared more last season than Zion on ESPN/Tiwtter/Reddit was LeBron.
‚ÄúA1 from day 1 lamelo ball‚Äù what?
"lamelo needs to initiate the offense, why does he keep giving the ball to hayward"
this is how I've been feeling so far about Lamelo. everything he's doing so far was super predictable yet so many people are acting surprised. People just really don't trust overseas ball.
Ja Morant.      Edit: maybe not. I thought his steals numbers were higher.  I revise my guess to Lamelo Ball.
LaMelo Ball Win Shares: 1.8  Anthony Edwards Win Shares: -0.7  Obviously judging them right now is extremely premature but after 30 games Ball has been way better and it's not particularly close
Loving the hornets tid bit of you only got the answer of Lamelo ball and miles bridges
Serious question. What justifies a tech foul? The other day Lamelo Ball scores on Conley and then signals to him that he‚Äôs a midget but nothing is called. I see Giannis mean mugging KAT here and it‚Äôs called.   I don‚Äôt geddit?
"Holy shit those have to be the worst stats I've ever seen in my life lmfao.  The first one has Lamelo Ball above Kawhi leonard and Kyle Kuzma above Ben Simmons.  The other one has CJ Mccollum at 11, which is laughably stupid, and Devonte Graham at 9."
Can I go by ESPN standards and say Lamelo Ball. He‚Äôs got more highlights than anyone.
"And that's why I don't like **LaMelo Ball.** Sure, he is a talented young player and will be an All-star no doubt in the future but his arrogance is off-putting. Hopefully he matures as he gets older."
"Invest? Probably not. I don't know much about this Top Shot thing, but I wouldn't bet on it being around or popular anymore by the time LaMelo Ball is an all-star."
LaMelo Ball
Grover Hardwood and LaMelo Ball seem to bring out the best in our guys. Eventually
lamelo ball and anthony edwards annoy thr fuck out of me... they remind me of all the arrogant kids i went to hs with. theyre like the loud fortnite trashtalking 12 yr olds old enough to play in the nba
"I thought Lamelo Ball would be the SAME player as Nick Young. shooting dynamics, dumb plays, questionable attitude... boy was i off"
I gotta say i seen that LaMelo Ball kid do some crazy shit i never seen nobody else do before. Not sayin he the best but def got a unique skill set
Lamelo  Ball is a cocky little shit who won‚Äôt achieve shit in his career - overrrated af
Lamelo Ball loses by 22 points? Didn't know he has his own team
"clock winds down to 9:45 seconds left in the first quarter  ball is inbounded to Lamelo who turns face to face against Gobert  ""You took my family""  moves to the left  ""You took my friends""  moves to the right  ""You took all that was dear to me""  clock winds down to 9:42  ""I cant get them back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR MY FRIENDS""  goes up, fire coming out of his shoes  ""LAMELORUKEN""  Ball flies over Goberts head, goes straight into basket. Lamelo falls to the ground, exhausted.  ""Hayward... Senpai... I...""  faints  Final Score  Jazz 132  Hornets 110"
"The moment LaMelo Ball disrespected Mike Conley, this game was over. I don‚Äôt care how nice his game is, you don‚Äôt come in as a rookie and disrespect the most universally respected vet in the league for no reason. He was doing it to get back at Royce O‚ÄôNeale, but like‚Ä¶ say something to Royce then. Mike doesn‚Äôt deserve that shit, especially from a kid."
"He was insanely raw coming in but he‚Äôs been averaging 24 for over a month on decent efficiency and increasing usage. And that‚Äôs with defenses now game planning to stop him, which is a clear acknowledgement to his impact on the offense. Defense is a mess but there are signs of improvement there as well.  LaMelo had a couple years of pro ball under his belt coming in and a lifetime of coaching, so he was always expected to start out better than anyone else in this class. He‚Äôs played very well but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs shown the ‚Äútake over a game‚Äù ability they Ant has flashed. If his improvement trajectory maintains til end of the year I don‚Äôt think anyone could be too upset about the award going to Ant."
"Cade Cunningham - Trevor Lawrence: Tall/Big generation talents that every team wants  Patrick Beverly - Jalen Ramsey (ramsey a lot better but the attitude and skillset): Defensive focused players in LA that are aggressive, get a lot of fouls, talk shit and love to take on the star player of the other team, heart and soul of team  Daniel Jones RJ Barrett:Young top 10 picks out of 2019 Duke that have been really good but sometimes inconsistent. Are both doubted and underrated by media  Kyler Murray Devin Booker or Lamelo Ball: Young exciting prospects out of Arizona (Besides Ball) that will be top players in the future  Aaron Donald Rudy Gobert: Large players that impact the entire defense of their team  DK Metcalf/Zion Williamson: Large freak athletes with a really bright future in the league  Baker Mayfeild Lonzo Ball: Top picks in their respective class that haven't panned out but are still good players, Lonzo is a lot like a QB and they both have been overshadowed by better players in their draft"
Lamelo ball - Justin Herbert
"Yeah look at Pop. He changed his entire scheme to fit Derozan and Gay while still holding onto some of the motion/triangle stuff that they won their last championship with. He know Demar and Rudy aren‚Äôt going to just run around like JJ Reddick all night and it‚Äôs not what they excel at. He‚Äôs figure out a nice middle ground between iso five out ball and his traditional motion offense.  I would say Kerr should do this too but this team is so bad idk if it even matters. They need to minute restrict Steph and try and really work on wiseman‚Äôs game. This year is a wash at this point. I thought if they flipped Wiggins or Oubre for somebody they might have a chance to win a playoff round but it‚Äôs not worth potentially seriously injuring Steph just to play the play in tournament. I think Bob Meyers deserves some blame for bringing in Oubre when they already had shooting problems. I don‚Äôt blame him for the wiseman pick because Klay was healthy at that point and they didn‚Äôt necessarily need Halliburton or Lamelo. But man, imagine one of those two with Curry out there. They‚Äôd be so much better."

"Doncic teammates let him get the boards to pad his stats. Doncic is not a good rebounder. Doncic is a great passer and good at getting to the bucket and scoring. Doncic is not a good shooter. There are plenty of players who can do what Doncic does but I'll name 5 other than Russell Westbrook for you. Ben Simmons, SGA, LaMelo Ball, Jrue Holiday, Ja Morant."

"Ready for the downvotes, but I find it corny as hell how RJ Barrett was deemed a bust in his first season, was snubbed from the all rookie team, and has basically been ignored for the majority of his sophomore season despite all his improvements because he was inefficient and on a bad team last year. Anthony Edwards rookie season so far is just as ""bad"" as RJ's rookie season statistically aside from PPG. He's even more inefficient and is on a worse team with a worse record than the Knicks last year but he has been getting nothing but praise and attention throughout this season and people are ready to call him rookie of the year (mostly because Lamelo is out).  The double standards are wack as hell. If people were ready to write RJ off as a 19 year old rookie why is that same energy not present for Anthony Edwards who is pretty much in the same exact situation? Miss me with all that man it's goofy. I'm sure Anthony Edwards is gonna have a solid season next year, but ROY of the discussion should be primarily about Lamelo Ball regardless of the games missed. Since apparently y'all care so much about the efficiency of a 19 year old rookie."

"Totally, yes. Nothing even remotely close to the level (if measured by $$$) of those ""major"" leagues.   My point is there is a void of league, and a surplus of talent, plus a small social movement (like with what you see going on with GME) with some people tired of the Billionaire society who have created this unstoppable monopoly system where they just get richer and harder to compete with (barriers of entry higher and higher).   You see college level players starting to choose Australian pro league or the G-League over college opportunities and it starting to work out well (Lamelo Ball...more coming next year with NBA draft)"
Lamelo Ball&gt;Anthony Edwards but both will be good
"&gt;I'd disagree, but you may be right. I think primary playmaking is the most important skill in the modern NBA, with shooting right after. Ball has the first, and the second has improved   I mean he's an okay playmaker for a SG and deciding he can't improve on that is stupid in his rookie year lol. But his body type, athleticism all means he could be a much better defender and scorer than LaMelo.   He's also got one of the quickest first steps in the NBA. Once he gets his shot down he'll be a legit problem."
"Gotta feel bad for the Kings. They haven't finished a season over .500 since 2006.  For clarification, that was LeBron's first year in the playoffs.   Chris Paul, Derron Williams, and Andrew Bogut made the All-Rookie team that year.   Clifford Robinson and Kevin Willis were still kicking around.   LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and J. J. Reddick weren't even in the league at that time.   Al Horford and Joakim Noah were teammates in college. Kevin Durant was a year away from declaring for the draft.   Derrick Rose was still in high school.   Blake Griffin was 5 years away from playing his first NBA game.   Antony Davis was still in GRADE school.   Luka would have been in the second grade!  LaMelo Ball would have been in pre-school.  &amp;#x200B;  THAT'S how long it has been since the Kings were over .500.   &amp;#x200B;  :-("
I mean that‚Äôs not true if you watch basketball but you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not talking about Anthony Edwards. I‚Äôm talking about LaMelo Ball not being a top 3 player under 25 or how he projects because 1. He isn‚Äôt and 2. He just isn‚Äôt that good relative to the dudes he was ranked above
"If ESPN was really just trying to stir up contoversy, they would do something more drastic than leave out RJ Barrett. I think he genuinly just got left out. I was reffering to Jayson Tatum was put under Lamelo Ball"
BuT LaMeLO BalL iS BeTeR tHaN EiTheR Of TheM
"trae young is on the list and Lonzo ball isnt ranked over either of those guys. If you mean Lamelo, id probably disagree with you on that Lamelo&gt;Jaylen Brown if we are going off of potential"
"Theo is 6th.   Poku, Patrick Williams, LaMelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, Killian Hayes, then Theo"
"This year Lamelo has been:  1. The youngest player to record a triple double.  2. The youngest player to make 7 threes in a game.  3. One of three rookies to make 7 threes and dish 10 assists in a game  4. Only rookie in the last 60 years to lead all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals heading into the all-star break.  5. One of three NBA players age 20 or younger to have multiple 20/10/5 games (the other two being Lebron James and Luka Doncic).  6. One of three rookies to record 7 threes and 10 assists in a game (the other two being Steph Curry and Jason Kid).  7. One of two rookies to average 15/5/5 and 2 threes (the other rookie being Luka Doncic).  8. Per 36, one of two rookies to post 18/6/6 for a season (the other being a Oscar Robertson; less impressive if he doesn‚Äôt play again this year).  That is literally the definition of historic.  Before he went down he was the prohibitive favorite to win ROY. Sports media regularly said at the point he went down that it was his to lose.   [This article does a pretty good job putting his season into perspective](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fansided.com/2021/03/03/nylon-calculus-comparing-lamelo-ball-greatest-nba-rookies-ever/amp/)  Games missed going to be his biggest black mark, but with an injury unlikely to inhibit his growth going forward and how he was head and shoulders better than every other rookie, in the eyes of many a stat nerd he‚Äôs done enough to be deserving of ROY. Don‚Äôt think he gets it but we all know who the best rookie this year was."
Hindsight Lamelo Ball should have been #2 and Wiseman #3. I personally think Haliburton will have a better career than Wiseman as well but at this stage his overall potential would stil have him as a fair #3.
"Lmao ok James Wiseman is better than lamelo. Despite everything that says otherwise...literally everything. Ball came here dominated his rookie class just like all the players that got drafted from pro leagues that blazed that trail for him. Wait I'm sorry he didn't outplay his rookie class, he was just further along in his development. I can't wait until Marvin bagley shows the world that he should have been picked over Luka. He just needed to catch up on his development bc he didn't have the luxury of playing pro ball...he was stuck at Duke like a bum"
Well yeah. You can't compare luka's pro career with ball's. Luka was getting mvps while ball was taken back to the states bc he wasn't getting minutes. He then played his senior season against people ages 16-21 in the jba. Its a ridiculous argument anyway. Euro players never came into the league with an edge on their college counterparts. And to say that lamelo ball was only better this year than James Wiseman is because he played a year of pro ball over seas is even more ridiculous. I can't tell if your trolling or you're related to Wiseman lol
I mean that comes with being drafted number 2.. over LaMelo Ball
I would've drafted LaMelo Ball so the Warriors could actually be a playoff team this season instead of maybe fighting for a play-in.
"I'm lost. The kings don't have a better record than the warriors. However, the hornets and lamelo ball do. Record isn't even relevant though, they're all rookies on garbage teams (except lamelo)"
Lamelo ball is the 3rd best player of all time
"If playing overseas is such an advantage, why don't other prospects do it? They would make money and get into the league as an almost finished product?  There's absolutely no evidence that a 19 yo who played a year of overseas ball is more likely to contribute than a 19 yo who played a year at Kentucky. It didn't work out for brandon Jennings or mudiay. It didn't work out for the countless foreign prospects who got drafted and never made it. I get that your a dubs fan and want your team to succeed, but you're really reaching here. Wiseman looked lost and overmatched physically. It's more concerning to me that Wiseman looks lost on the mental part of the game as he does have some physical tools. I genuinely hope that Wiseman goes on to have a great career, but I would bet my 1st born that lamelo has a better career"
"Well let's compare them as rookies since Lamelo was named a starter, where they both got around 31 mpg.  Tatum 13.9 ppg 5 reb 1.6 assist .7 blocks 1 steal  Melo 19.5 ppg 5.8 reb 6.2 assist .3 blocks 1.7 steals  Tatum is primarily a scorer who plays a lot of iso ball and doesn't make those around him better.  Melo is already one of the best passers in the league, already one of the best ball handlers in the league, has shown tremendous scoring potential and is already top 10 in the league in terms of making their teammates better.   Tatum is never going to make his teammates better to the degree melo can, and I am of the belief when melo puts weight on his frame he is going to be a deadly scorer. I think Melo will be the better rebounder of the two as well.   So yes I see Ball with the higher ceiling. That does not mean Melo will reach it."
They made the classic mistake of drafting over fit than need. At the top of the draft you have to target talent. Lamelo Ball would be so fun on this roster next to Steph and Klay.
Give me Jamal murray over 6-10. Lamelo ball? really?
Lamelo ball 3rd??? No brown on this list???
Lamelo projects to be a good defender though. A tall defensive pass first pg that can play some off ball seems like a good fit to me. But hindsight is 20/20 and it's easy to say that they should have picked him now
When LaMelo Ball is out*****
People were clowning him because of the Lamelo thing early on. Raptor fans were amped that he outplayed Ball in the preseason and apparently that meant that we thought he was going to be better than Ball
LaMelo ball and if you say overrated Haliburton u deserve u basketball knowledge card revoked.
"Well those reports about the Warriors thinking Ball was better could have been smokescreens, but if there's truth to them I think we can all agree that they screwed up. And while I didn't think he'd look this good, I've got a signed BBB sweater to prove that I thought Lamelo should've gone #1"
i hope he gets injured the way he disrespects Lamelo Ball
"You can do hindsight draft picks with most teams.  I do agree though that the FO could have done a lot better even during the Golden Era and got lucky that they landed KD and are located in San Fran.  Picking Jacob Evans at #28 in 2018 is pretty awful in retrospect. In most drafts, you don't typically expect a late 1st rounder to become a major contributor, but that draft was deep with as you say, a bunch of players picked later than #28 being major rotational pieces right now.  Jordan Poole is a weird pick and the Warriors would be better today with Keldon Johnson, KPJ or Nic Claxton but this is more on Kerr not playing Poole earlier and now playing him in awful line-ups.  Wiseman at #2 made a lot of sense so I can't entirely fault the front office but damn Lamelo Ball or Tyrese Haliburton would have made the Warriors so much more competitive right now, next season, and Lamelo to me projects to be a way better player."
People in this thread are severely misinterpreting the word ‚Äúhyped‚Äù.  Lamelo Ball may not have been #1. But he was definitely more hyped then say a someone like Trendon Watford who people here probably don‚Äôt even know who he is because he‚Äôs not as hyped but ranked higher.
"Why are people saying Zion wasn‚Äôt hyped?  He was extremely hyped?  Was it because he wasn‚Äôt #1 in his class?  The only people ahead of him were RJ Barrett and Marvin Bagley who were also very hyped.  Personally,  I think they knocked him to #2 because of his competition in HS while RJ was a freshman starter on Montverde.   I could remember Zion vs Lamelo amassing 120k viewers on Facebook live stream and that's completely unheard of.  Lamelo Ball was also extremely hyped being a freshman started on one of the best high school teams ever(Chino Hills)."
LaMelo Ball was doing a pretty good impression before he got hurt.
I broke both of my wrist (scaphoid bone)  First time playing basketball and the second time skateboarding.  The recovery is really frustrating and the bone takes a long time to heal. Maybe a year or more.  Definitely Lamelo will lose range of motion and strength on the wrist.  I recommend that he starts considering changing his shooting mechanisms especially the realese of the ball.  I hope he do great because from my experience i had  really bad time recovering
Number 2 just before Jerry West and just after LaMelo Ball
"To be fair, Wiseman was a consensus top-3 pick. No one thought Lamelo would be as good as he‚Äôs been tbh. Despite that, Ball had years of professional experience while Wiseman barely even played at the college level. He was always going to be more NBA-ready."
"if you cant move in tight spaces you cant handle the ball in traffic and keep your dribble or playmake in a crowd.  its why some people are slashers and make plays from the post, elbows, wings etc and others are pgs and sgs who can run an offense in every which way from pnr, in a crowd etc.  this isnt arbitrary, its whats required to play the position. guard like movement isnt being fast for your size and taking someone off the dribble, its a short area quickness, body control, and reaction time.  think of the difference between lamelo ball and wiggins. around the same height and frame, but wiggins cant react or move like a guard, so hes a slasher/wing. lamelo can, so hes a playmaking guard.  kd moves like a bigger andrew wiggins w less bounce. he doesnt have the short area reaction time and wiggle guards do. however you frame it, he doesnt move like a guard"
Lamelo ball cannot make up for the physique Edwards has
lamelo ball
Edwards chucking up 40 shots a game does not make him better than LaMelo jesus. Ball can play within an offense on a good team and still put up amazing stats. Edwards is out here taking more shots than KAT.
And LaMelo already played a year of pro ball
"It is way too early for people to be saying the Warriors should have picked LaMelo over Wiseman. Ball is putting up good stats on the Hornets and is the better player for sure right now, but the Warriors picked Wiseman because he is a better fit and has higher upside for their system imo. If Klay did not tear his achilles, I guarantee the Warriors would be a decent playoff team at this time.   LaMelo's stats would not be what they are right, sharing a court with Steph, healthy Klay, Dray, and Wiggins. In addition to that, LaMelo's playmaking was not needed with Steph and Draymond on the team. His defense is very questionable too, and his shot is an uncertainty as well.  Who knows what Wiseman's stats would be on a team where he has more of the green light on.   Plus, the Warriors were really lacking talent and size at the center position. They had to draft a player that has great size, length, and athleticism, to possibly defend players like AD, Jokic, Nurkic, KAT, Gobert, etc out west later on down the road. Wiseman is 7'1"" with a 7'6"" wingspan, has freakish athleticism, and has shown promising potential with his shooting. He has legit potential to be a star two way big one day. I think in the long run, it will pay off for them. I am still not completely sold on LaMelo yet."
"What would have been a 'win-now' move?   This draft wasn't that good. LaMelo didn't look like he could shoot despite his playmaking, which wouldn't be as useful in the starting lineup because Draymond has to be the primary ball handler. Edwards has the same lack of shooting and efficiency despite his athletic gifts. But more importantly, Warriors needed another true center besides Chriss."
Looks like a less flashy LaMelo Ball.
/r/DetroitPistons top post after the draft:  Killian is LaMelo Ball with a more complete offensive tool kit.
LaMelo Ball
"What? That‚Äôs exactly what the Warriors small ball were dude, Klay would guard 3s in that lineup.  You don‚Äôt go to that lineup all the time though, you play Lamelo as the 6th man when all are healthy.  The fit would be totally fine, Lamelo would still get 30 minutes per game off the bench."
This is understated. I don't hate the kid. I really don't but he has some serious flaws in his game. We took him instead of Lamelo because of fit. I just looked at the stats. Lamelo is currently out rebounding our 7 ft big and ball is injured now.
"&gt;Draymond is a 4 that needs to be involved in almost every play to not allow his defender to just straight up ignore him  That's a good point, Draymond is quite limiting in a way while also being a great playmaker, in what needs to be played because of how incapable of scoring he is himself.  Still, they also play quite some minutes without Draymond and that makes it clear that his value in general is positive for this roster: without him they just don't have playmaking. All these guys become kinda just logs drifting on a river, nobody having any space, team offense level that's just shameful in 2021.   Wiseman's kinda a guy that is only a viable scorer if you just give him the ball in a nice open place and then he immediately shoots, preferably from close to the basket (he seemingly has a potential to be a great 3-pt shooter for his size, but this season it's 34%, 25% when Curry is not on court).  Overall, I imagine Bob Myers must have these moments where you just stare blankly and feel a hit of emptiness on the memory that you picked Wiseman over LaMelo. Jesus what a gigantic loss it seems to be now."
"If I am picking top 3, why would I pick a guy that isn't a top 3 prospect? I am trying to pick stars.  Giannis as a prospect wasn't that good, wasn't even in top league in Greece. If Giannis was picked third, he wouldve struggled because  he would've been tasked with creating his own offense due to playing on a completely dysfunctional team.  Giannis development was standard for a guy who is a late lottery pick and has NBA skills. Most of development came when his body started changing and the ball was put in his hands. If anything, the Thunder who had the 12th pick should've drafted Giannis because they had the talent to take the risk of him flamming out. They drafted Steven Adam who had zero skills besides being big and strong. What's the difference between an unskilled 7 footer and a raw big wing with some guard skills?  Thinking raw players like Giannis will turn into MVP like players if you just put the time in is what leads teams to picking someone like Dragan Bender 4th and Bender actually played in a top European league, albeit off the bench. Suns could've had Jamal Murray, a guy that demonstrated he was clutch and capable of scoring at will in college.  I am taking that Jamal over some 7 footer that supposedly dribble and shoot but rarely get minutes.  My mentality is what leads the Warriors to pick LaMelo or Hali over James Wiseman. Lol, I would've even picked Patrick Williams over Wiseman if I wanted a project player. At least he plays the 3/4 wing, most important position in the NBA."
"He's shown flashes, he has above average ball handling skills for a guy of his size, he's crazy athletic like expected, maybe even more, he's one of more athletically gifted player in the league but :  \- his hands are terrible, he struggles to catch passes, and is overall a mediocre finisher on non dunks, the finishing will improve once he starts to realize the level of his opponents, the hands are worrisome  \- he has no defensive instincts, he can kinda move his feet so he can have some versatility, but in drop coverage he has no ability to read what the offensive player wanna do, he WILL get better on that,but a lot of his ceiling was the ability to be a DPOY level defender in his prime, and those kind of center usually show way more even at a young age. He's kinda like a worse rookie Ayton defensively, and Ayton is now a good defender (worth noting that I'm not sure he has THAT level of lateral quickness)  \- he settles way too much in the post for ""soft"" moves  IMO he still projects as a good starting center, but picking him ahead of Lamelo looks terrible now. And with Edwards showing more flashes in the ""rookie that kills his team but clearly has tons of potential"" mold, Wiseman may end up being the big mistake of the top 3. But the top 10 after that looks rooooough and drafting Haliburton, Stewart or Vassell that high would've been crazy : he still has way more upside than those guys  &amp;#x200B;  To be fair the Warriors are a weird team, they don't run that much PNR, Draymond is a 4 that needs to be involved in almost every play to not allow his defender to just straight up ignore him. Maybe he'd look better on a more normal offense, but that make the pick even weirder because Lamelo would be perfect."
Comparing Ju to Oubre is like comparing MJ to Lamelo ball
LaMelo Ball is the 2nd Coming of Jason Kidd
Malachi Flynn today: 16 points. Lamelo ball today: 0 points. enough said.
LaMelo Ball could never
"Or drafted LaMelo, at least. Of course that's 20/20 hindsight on our part, but I recall hearing something from Myers about them being set on taking Ball until a late dinner with Wiseman changed their minds, so it looks as if they were likely to grab the PG until they did a late 180 and drafted Hasheem Thabeet instead."

Lamelo ball
"It's a luxury now in the nba to have a lead ball handler that is tall and skilled, see Jokic, lebron, luka, simmons, LaMelo. Don't overthink it."
"I know this sounds crazy, but if you want a team that is super fun to watch where absolutely no one will consider you a bandwagon fan, consider the Hornets!!  They are seriously sooo fun to watch, especially when Lamelo comes back.    Their players who might not be the best in the league but are just really cool and good at all the fun stuff.  You'll see some *ccrazyyy* dunks and alley oops, some crazy passing and ball handling, some crazy game winners, etc., and a team that is just having fun and playing hard.  The Hornets kinda rule after being distinctly not fun for, like, over a decade."
"Star =/= all-star, I find DeMar DeRozan a star this season and he wasn't an all-star. By your definition ""future star"", players who haven't made an all-star team yet but will most likely make it some day: Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball and who else?"
All people will remember him for is passing on LaMelo Ball.
"&gt; The potential Wiseman-Curry p&amp;r is way more lethal than whatever you think Lamelo can bring to GS  I like how you continue to insist I don‚Äôt watch the warriors, and then expose yourself with a take like this. Anyone who thinks Steve Kerr is going to spam pick n roll with Steph has 0 clue what they‚Äôre talking about. The defining characteristic of Kerrs revolutionary offense is the use of ball movement opposed to pnr. And anyway draymond is a better pnr partner for Steph than wiseman, because draymond can make plays off the short roll."
"Lamelo is 6‚Äô6‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt some little point guard we‚Äôre talking about pairing with Steph. Both lamelo and klay have the length to guard 3‚Äôs, in fact klay will probably have to guard 3s next year because he will lose a step and struggle to keep up with quicker 2s.   All 3 of steph klay and lamelo can thrive off ball as well. Steph is not the type of point guard who pounds the ball in iso, playing with another sevant playmaker would just get him easier looks and extend his career by reducing his ball handling load. It‚Äôs madness that you can‚Äôt picture how powerful the warriors playstyle could be. Do you remember the pre Durant warriors? High flying exciting transition basketball. You know who sounds like an ideal fit in that kind of system? Lamelo, not some middle of the road traditional center who would be benched to allow the warriors to play their best lineups (draymond at 5)"
"Dude fuck your data &amp; just watch the game, Golden State got a wing in a 7 footer‚Äôs body who‚Äôs going to develop a respectable 3 ball and off the dribble game and he‚Äôs going to fit perfectly next to Steph and Klay  And once again you‚Äôre ignoring fit; there‚Äôs no place for Lamelo on that team  Golden State has 0 regrets picking Wiseman"
"Saw a Bulls beat reporter recently say AK loved Haliburton but thought he needed to go for a home run once we jumped into the top 4, and believed he hit it with Pat.   Nice to know the guy running the show is on point in the draft, especially when our sub would have gladly taken Deni over LaMelo Ball."
"If that wasn't enough, Hornets with Left-over Celtics (Hayward, Rosier &amp; even Wanamaker) are 2 games over .500 and 4th seed now. All without ROY Lamelo Ball for last 5 (Went 4-1, pushed suns to OT).  It has to be deflating at some point to see all the bottom feeders overachieving and you are doing way below expectations for a ECF team.  Heat are kinda in the same boat, but I can never fault their effort. They are no. 6 in defence for the season, for the most part their struggles have been injuries, Covid and just shots not Falling. But they still find a way to win because they defend for 4 quarters.  Last night they held Indiana scoreless for 5 mins in the 4th quarter."
Is it disrespectful that when I hear Melo I think of LaMelo Ball?
"We have an exciting, absurdly clutch team, especially when our up-and-coming star LaMelo Ball returns from injury. We also have the best announce team in the league (Eric Collins and Dell Curry), so every game will be entertaining. But mostly, r/charlottehornets has the best memes."
"PG: Isaiah Thomas  SG: Damian Lillard  SF: Terrence Ross  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Nikola Jokic  Bench: LaMelo Ball, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo"
"I've seen it frequently commented on this sub where people say ""Haliburton is having the better rookie season and should be ROTY, but I'd take Edwards long-term"" -- why??  I get that Edwards has *fLaShEs* but Haliburton is better at almost everything on the court. He's a better shooter, a better finisher, a better passer, a better defender, a better PnR player, he absolutely demolishes Edwards across the board in basketball IQ. Edwards is (much) more athletic and younger, people are swept on on the tools and potential when Haliburton has some great potential himself. And Edwards isn't eve THAT much younger -- 17 months. It's not like Haliburton is some Malcolm Brogdon 23 year old rookie, he just plays with the polish of an older rookie.  Haliburton plays off-ball more while Edwards has a higher usage, but I don't necessarily see that as a plus for Edwards. Haliburton will be an elite swiss army knife that can play next to anyone in the backcourt, while Edwards projects to be a low efficiency volume scorer who probably will always have to play next to a good defensive guard.  In a redraft I'd absolutely go with LaMelo #1 and Haliburton #2."
"Now someone who really can from the streets, LaMelo Ball."
"Lol competitive where? Lamelo is good but slow down bro, he‚Äôs not playoff ready. Kelly isn‚Äôt replacing Thompson, he‚Äôs playing knowing full well Kly is coming back and he‚Äôs getting benched at best once he‚Äôs in full form(if I should say).   For Lamelo to be so young and have so much potential, it makes 0 sense to have him on a team with champion caliber guards. They are literally 2 of the best shooters ever. Lamelo would ride the bench too long, and get reduced minutes in the playoffs for allay. They wouldn‚Äôt be contenders this year with him on the team right now.   And that‚Äôs even pre-Harden nets. Lamelo is good but pump the breaks, him and Steph are not a ring winning duo in this league. Besides Lamelo is a better on ball guard then off. Let him play elsewhere with less pressure to win now and develop. Let‚Äôs have this conversation when he‚Äôs shown consistency. Championships take time."
"Yea here: https://www.sportscasting.com/lamelo-ball-charlotte-hornets-golden-state-warriors-nba/  They told Ball they were drafting him, on draft night, which is why Ball put up the ‚Äú2‚Äù sign saying ‚Äúlook at my fingers. two‚Äù to indicate he was going second. Then they changed their minds."
"I didn't mean to imply that. My point was that I just lived through the retirements of all the greats of my early fandom, and that it is hard to say goodbye to the players you idolized when you started following the league.   I am very excited about the new generation as well, but it's a bit different being a fan as an adult. I am never going to save up money for a Zion Williamson shoe, put up a Luka poster above my bed, or open 10 packs of basketball cards looking for a Lamelo Ball rookie card."
"Thats true, i wasnt trying to say his current play is great but his potential seems to be played down a lot. Not everyone can be a lamelo ball lol hope he gets back soon, a blast to watch"
"The year is 20XX. De‚ÄôAaron Fox plays at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on the injury report. The Fox availability metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches. Humanity has reached its pinnacle. The low tier peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leader of 20XX, the Sacramento Kings, and their army, the Fox monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Fox with one hand, and winning championships with the other. The basketball metagame has gotten to this point where everything is played out to theoretical perfection, so other teams pray Fox is out for the night, and that‚Äôs the game.  The leaders of the anti-20XX movement aim to keep 20XX from coming. These warriors include Trae Young, Luka Doncic, LaMelo Ball, and Cade Cunningham. They are all fighting to keep the apocalypse at bay, the De‚ÄôAaron Fox apocalypse. But their efforts are futile. Their silly stepbacks, thirty foot jumpers, slick passes, and height are no match for Fox‚Äôs raw speed, the only viable advantage in the National Basketball Association‚Äôs version of basketball. Try as you will, but 20XX is coming. Or maybe, it‚Äôs already here."
"lamelo. Can fit in more schemes, and just a lot bette r on the offensive side of the ball."
"Lonzo has been great defensively and is making shots, still think he is, and will be very good, but the fact that despite making his 3's well he's still below average efficiency and usage says it all.  He's still pretty powerless as an on ball guy in the halfcourt, teams just don't even bother even mixing up pnr coverage for him.  On the other end Lamelo has less defensive upside, but we've already seen team felt like they had to switch him on pnr and he's already shown way more shot creation.  Lonzo fit better on a team with a playmaking wing, but it's not like Lamelo couldn't fit on such team, Lamelo can already be a primary ball handler, Lonzo can't"
"Not arguing if edwards is a positive player, he‚Äôs not, most rookies aren‚Äôt. But watch the possessions he was getting before the coaching change. He‚Äôd only get the ball for bail out isolations with less than 8 seconds on the shot clock. Now that the wolves are getting healthy and he‚Äôs playing as a part of their offense he‚Äôs looked like the best rookie besides Lamelo in the past month.    Edwards last 10 games: 24/5/3 on 42/35/73 with impressive defense for a rookie."
There are other things to consider when drafting like team needs and ceiling. There's a reason why Anthony Edwards and Lamelo Ball went ahead even though they aren't as fundamentally sound.
"Dude Lamelo Ball also had horrendous shooting splits in NZ.  Clearly it isn't as simple as a 1:1 translation, this is just a silly argument.  He was an 18 year old playing in a foreign country.    High schoolers playing in either Euro or NZ almost alwayssss have horrible effiency.  It doesn't automatically mean they will be trash here.  Hampton actually looked really good in the minutes he got this year.  That's why almost literally every Nuggets fan who watches every game was hoping it would be Bol instead of Hampton to be traded.  Hampton has a ton of promise.  It's asinine to hang his reputation on his shooting splits on New Zealand when he was a teenager."
"Charlotte, LaMelo bout to ball out for the next decade"
"Usually players who are young and with high potential. To mind Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Lamelo Ball, John Collins, Ja Morant, Murray, Mitchell, MPJ. B- tier players that could probably go to A - tier. BI Murray and Mitchell are already all-stars."
" Now : Luka &gt;&gt;&gt; Trae &gt; Shai  &gt;Sexton &gt; Ja &gt; Lonzo &gt; Fultz &gt; Lamelo &gt; Haliburton &gt; Garland &gt; Quickley &gt; THT(not a primary ball handler hard to compare) KPJ &gt; White &gt; Maledon &gt;  Poole (sample size is too small to put higher)   &amp;#x200B;  Future : Luka &gt; Shai &gt; Ja &gt; Trae &gt; Lamelo &gt; KPJ (either he's that high or he's in China in 3 years no middle ground) &gt; Haliburton &gt; Sexton &gt; Lonzo &gt; Garland &gt; THT &gt; Fultz &gt; Quickley  &gt; Maledon &gt; White &gt; Poole  &amp;#x200B;  I didn't include Anthony and Lewis haven't seen them enough, IMO White and Poole are more 6th many type, and THT isn't a point guard"
Breaking: sources tell me Jayson Tatum and Jayken Brown were traded today for Lamelo Ball
"Ah yes, LaMelo Ball, the rookie averaging 16 points per game. Don't get me wrong, he's great, but his peak will prob be a solid all star, as he seems like the typical rookie of the year favorite. Not one of the faces of the league though."

Like what some else said the boner you kids have for lamelo is comical....So Weird. I remember how Ball fans attacked Detroit for waiving Dianglo. This aint reality TV no more its the NBA get real kid. Lamelo nice and is incredibly similar to Lonzo. But he is not Jordan...he isn‚Äôt even Zion lol. He went 3rd in the draft for a reason. You need a reality check
There's a reason lamelo ball and rj Hampton came down here instead of playing college ball.
"Maybe, but why are we going to act like Wiseman is a bust. We were initially under the assumption that Klay would be healthy and wiseman fits their position of need. LaMelo was not the consensus number 1 pick and wiseman was going to be a work in progress. Give the kid some time, man barely played college ball and had basically no training or summer camp"
"&gt;In terms of athleticism, Ball would be below average by NBA standards and doesn‚Äôt have an explosive first step.   https://www.sportingnews.com/au/nba/news/nba-draft-2020-lamelo-ball-scouting-report-strengths-weaknesses-and-player-comparison/1pn54aictvw1w1gvymdiq82j1f  &gt;Ball is just an average athlete and lacks top level explosiveness and speed.  https://nbadraftroom.com/p/lamelo-ball/"
"Anthony Edwards has shot 50% from the field or better 17 times this season in 70 games played.   LaMelo Ball has shot 50% from the field or better 19 times in 49 games played.   Am I doing the arbitrary, cherrypicked stats thing right?"

"He's been inconsistent and you're just facing recency bias because he's been bad to start the season and has only ramped up lately. Ant's also has a efg% of 48% which is terrible with 41.6% from the field and 32.9% from deep.  His team is also out of the play-in if that matters. 22 wins compared to fellow ROTY nominees Ball and Hali at 33 and 31 respectively.  The one thing Ant has over Lamelo is games played but in the games Ant has played, he's been a negative at VORP of -0.4, OBPM of -1.0, DBPM of -1.7. meanwhile Lamelo beats him with a slashline of those metrics at 1.5/1.3/0.7.   The thing is if we're really using games played as a factor then we should just hand it to Tyrese. He's played a huge majority of the season, has his team at a higher seed than the Twolves, has better advanced metrics by a mile and has been 100% consistent. Also, both players are more efficient than Ant.   It's Ball or Tyrese."
Philly vs Heat but the Photo is of Lamelo Ball?
"Last year's draft prospects aren't a complete mystery box anymore, we've actually seen some of them play. There's no reason to assume anyone in this class will be better than LaMelo Ball (who is having a historic rookie season).  You can blow smoke about Cade or Green or Kuminga, whoever but they are unknown quantities. I don't think Green has more potential than Edwards either"
LaMelo ball
Can I have Lamelo Ball please
Thank you for the work you do on this sub. Can I please have the player flair LaMelo Ball on my username. Thanks
Lmfao are you on crack? Pre-injury LaMelo Ball was way better than post-ASB Edwards.
"Yes because inefficient = being bad lmaoo watch the kid bro. The first few games of the season was an adjustment period after not playing ball for like 8 months and not knowing what team you‚Äôd be drafted to until a month before the season. Not to mention Ryan Saunders didn‚Äôt utilize him well and had him play with a lineup that had no spacing off the bench.  Yall putting too much stock into the first ‚Äúhalf‚Äù of the season like he was bad yet you don‚Äôt want to include the last half of the season to cancel it out, yet lamelo had an excellent start to the season but the time lost to injury and these bad stretches of games that he‚Äôs had since he returned doesn‚Äôt count against him now? Make it make sense"
"Ball.  He was consistently good the whole season even if Edwards was the best rookie of the 2nd part of the season.  Ball was the best rookie before he got hurt though.  Close race though although the LaMelo injury made the race closer.  I was wrong about Edwards though, Wolves made a good pick. It's the Warriors who fucked up this draft lmao"
LaMelo Ball because he wasn't a total garbage negative for half the season and is still much better
"If James Wiseman ends up having a better NBA career than LaMelo Ball (freak injuries nonwithstanding) I will eat my hat. Everyone gives Wiseman a lot of leeway right now, which is fine because he is barely 20 years old. But LaMelo isn't even 20 yet and he's *already an above-average NBA starter*. He's also one of the top 10 passers in the NBA, again as a 19 year old rookie. For Wiseman to catch LaMelo at this point would require an absurd, MIP-level developmental leap from JW that is at this point based on nothing."
lol chill rookies like Killian Hayes &amp; Lamelo Ball make that pass every other game
"I love superstars like Steph, Lebron, KD, Dame, etc., but my favorite players are never those guys.  The players I've had the most joy in watching in the last decade are guys who weren't (\*yet\* in some cases) even very good:   **Rookie Giannis**\--I watched every Bucks game just because he was liable to do sth I'd never seen at any given moment.   **Jonathan Isaac**\--just iso watching him on D is more exciting than most things on TV.   **Chris Bouchet**\--he weird. Trebuchet 3 shooter/shot blocker/stringbean.   **Tyrese Halliburton**\--not ""exciting"" like some of the others, but watching him figure out what's happening on the floor faster than the vets all around him is pretty amazing.   **Will Barton**\--all knees and elbows and ill-advised shots, with a nose for the ball off the glass and a love of leaping before he looks.   **LaMelo Ball**\--he does stuff nobody else does and it's freaky watching him sus out plays ahead of everyone else on the court."
"Saben Lee should be higher on the Kia Rookie Ladder with his cool 11.0 assists per 100 over nearly the same amount of games as LaMelo.      Ball is an indisputably great passer playing PG, I don't see what that has to do with comparing shooting efficiency with a SG."
They don't double Lamelo because he's a passing prodigy lol.   Hayward was also out with a foot strain during Lamelos best stretch. Also Lamelo is already a better lead ball handler than Rozier whose scouting report mainly consists of don't let him get hot on catch and shoots.
"My favorite Eric commentating moment is the one where the hornets get the steal ‚Äú here comes lamelo ball with his hair on fire, MIIIIIIIIIIIILLLES WOW‚Äù   https://youtu.be/JeEYS53pA7E"
"In 13 games since the all-star break, Lamelo is shooting 28% from beyond the arc and 67% from the FT line.   The wrist injury is probably a factor, but it might also be some regression as well. Nobody thought he'd shoot the ball as a rookie as well as he has this season."
"Literally no one is saying LaMelo is a stuck up piece of shit because of one technical. I doubt anyone is saying that about anything, but you can‚Äôt act like people don‚Äôt have 6+ years of exposure to the Ball brothers to form opinions they may have.  Reality is both Luka and LeMelo are unbelievable talents we‚Äôll be watching for years to come. Don‚Äôt make this into one fan base versus another."
"That could come with time. Jury was out on Steph early too due to his size and injuries his first few seasons.   *I'm in not way saying Trae is the next steph. I'm just saying he has tons of time to develop still.    Also, I really like lamelo ball, I think he's going to be a great NBA player and lead the league in assists at some point I'm sure."
"And the way Lamelo disrespected him earlier in the season, this was the perfect revenge. That 3pt at the end was a literal ""sit down son"" moment from Facu to Ball"

"More like ""LaMelo Ball got a tech for aggressively shoving the ref's hand away after the ref stuck an arm out to catch Ball when it looked like he might be stumbling into a collision."""
the ref wasn't watching him the whole time. the ref was looking to the left. that's why he looked surprised when melo went into him. it was a dead ball and lamelo shot the ball for no reason.
"Yeah, I had that thought, too, but this is LaMelo Ball. He's playing in the NBA--I don't know how someone who is *that* uncomfortable with contact being so comfortable in the NBA. At least there's no way he made it this far in his career without getting a reputation."
"LaMelo Ball gets tech for defending self from vicious ref attack.   Cmon man lol, this was clearly a warranted tech."
"""LaMelo Ball got a tech after committing a technical foul"""
"Lamelo literally ran into the ref, and the ref took the brunt of his momentum and slowed him down since he was moving in the opposite direction.   If Lamelo didn't want to make contact with the ref he shouldn't have went for a layup on a dead ball right in his direction in the first place. Shoving his arm down after the fact like an irritable brat was just uncordial for no reason"
Just in: Lamelo ball has been ejected from the city of Charlotte for unnecessary roughness
"LaMelo  Ball does not get to have the Melo nickname, yet. Melo belongs to Carmelo Anthony."
"Harden, westbrook, soon to be Lamelo and probably cade.  Guys who always have the ball in their hand and creating points."
stat looks busted.  no analytic worth its' salt can argue Cody Martin is more impactful than LaMelo Ball
"Lamelo Ball. Edwards has given him a run for his money near the end, but he‚Äôs lacked the impact that Ball has had all season. In fact I had Edwards on fantasy for a long while and he was pretty bad I even dropped him and no one grabbed him until recently."
The point on transition assists is a great one. It‚Äôs much easier to chuck it cross court for an easy lay in than having to break down a defense.   I‚Äôd also add lamelo ball to the list of guys who could take a shot at this record.
Rather have ant edwards than lamelo ball next season
Big Men take a lot longer to develop their game in the NBA. Plus Wiseman has barely played over the past two years. This rookie year has been stop/start with injuries and he played one game in college? We don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll end up being. High character individual means he has strong chance of succeeding even if it‚Äôs as a role player but GSW have got to be kicking themselves they didn‚Äôt draft LaMelo Ball. He‚Äôd be the bridge player for continued multi-decade dominance.
"GSW wanted Melo, they told Melo they were drafting him [(source)](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/09/warriors-nba-draft-promise-lamelo-ball/) and Lamelo even [indicated he was going 2 ](https://youtu.be/oKo6U3B6RVg) in the draft. But on draft night, even after news of Klay getting injured for the rest of the season, they changed their minds and went with Wiseman.... such a weird decision"
"GSW wanted Melo too, they told Melo they were drafting him [(source)](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/09/warriors-nba-draft-promise-lamelo-ball/) and Lamelo even [indicated he was going 2 ](https://youtu.be/oKo6U3B6RVg) in the draft. But on draft night, even after news of Klay getting injured for the rest of the season, they changed their minds and went with Wiseman.... such a weird decision"
Man I love Dame he reminds me of Lamelo Ball with better handles
"Skill: Miles Bridges. If he had a really good handle then he‚Äôd be a killer in iso.  Athleticism: Lamelo. A more athletic Lamelo could be like Russ with a better 3-ball.  Height: Either Terry or PJ. Terry because that would make him the height of a real SG (6‚Äô4), PJ because then he‚Äôd be a better ‚Äúsmall ball center‚Äù that could hope to defend better against rim runners."
Bryce Cotton played in the NBA. LaMelo Ball wasn't even close to top 5 NBL players last season and is now starting in the NBA. Joe Ingles is currently one of the best players on the number one seeded team in the NBA and he started his career and played many seasons in the NBL. JaeSean Tate got called up to the Rockets. Cam Oliver just this week signed a contract. Broekhoef has played NBA. The only way to really find out best leagues would be a champions league type contest which had never happened.
"**Skill Boost**: Miles Bridges. Bridges has developed a really good jumpshot and really good defense. If he had a better handle he‚Äôd probably be a perennial All-Star.   **Athleticism Boost**: LaMelo Ball. He‚Äôs not bad athletically, but a more athletic LaMelo would be pretty similar to LeBron...  **Length Boost**: PJ Washington. He‚Äôs been our best defensive center this season, but is a little small to play the position full time. If he added a few inches in height he‚Äôd be able to play the position full time and would fix our biggest weakness.   **Other Contenders:** A 6‚Äô4‚Äù-5‚Äù Terry Rozier would be a beast. A 6‚Äô7‚Äù Malik Monk has a lot of potential. An athletic Vernon Carey Jr would be a really good rookie. If the 6‚Äô10‚Äù McDaniels had a really good handle and playmaking he‚Äôd be super interesting, especially since he‚Äôs already a good shooter."
"I think he was trying to see how hard LaMelo was going to go for the loose ball, dude really wanted to best his big brother there"
Yeah man 43 year old Paul Pierce who hasn‚Äôt played in 5+ years is better than Lamelo Ball lol
"Imagine how stressful it must be playing alongside Lamelo and not knowing when and where the fuck the ball is gonna come from, until the ball lands in your hands and you score the basket"

"He‚Äôs not playing enough bully ball for his size.   If he increases stamina and is able to play 40mins in 82 games + post season, abusing his opponents with skill, intellect and size, he will have reached his ceiling.   Remember, bully ball dehumanizes defenders and causes despair. If he‚Äôll be able to use this to his advantage, defenses around him will collapse because many centers will just give up out of sheer impotence to defend him.   I think this is the decade of luka, lamelo and jokic."
Naw dude. That was the move that LaMelo was trying to pull off because he was trying to steal the ball. He was trying to LiAngelo the ball.
Talking about how he refused to pass the ball to Lamelo virtually all game.
they really thought that ball wasn't off lamelo
Malik monk is such a ball stopping issue for this team. Has 0 chemistry with Lamelo
"Going into this game I promised my dad 2 things:  1) LaMelo Ball is must watch TV 2) Hornet‚Äôs commentators are god tier  Both promises have been delivered upon, thanks Hornets!"
Why challenge lamelo ball!!?!?
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/nesn.com/2021/04/espns-top-under-25-nba-list-has-jayson-tatum-behind-lamelo-ball/amp/  Outside of bridges, Zo who here is RJ Barrett better than? Especially given that the list is missing garland and some other guys."

"why‚Äôs everybody acting like the first half of the season doesn‚Äôt apply?  also, even when comparing LaMelo‚Äôs games as a starter to Ant‚Äôs post-ASG (26 to 31 games) LaMelo is better across the board aside from points, and that‚Äôs because Ant shoots more. Ball has better shooting %s."
Lamelo ball and kyrie
"LaMelo Ball  I expected a disaster after Russillo trashed on him on all summer as a ball hog during his Australian but damn, if he's not fun to watch in the NBA!"
well this is talking about who will be a ‚Äúface‚Äù for the league. Lamelo Ball is already one of the biggest names in the sport and he‚Äôs only been in the league for half a season. Popularity is definitely a significant factor on who becomes the face of the league
Bro I don‚Äôt follow high school ball at all and knew about Zion his junior year but yeah his game against lamelo was like the craziest one
"Being really really good at hitting layups at will isn't that entertaining.   Lamelo is a 10x flashier player so he gets the coverage instead. Zion from a media entertainment point of view is kind of a bust because he's not doing nearly any of the crazy hyperathletic stuff he was doing in college.   From an actual ball pov though, goddam he's insane."
"Zion Williamson, Luka Doncic &amp; LaMelo Ball will be taking turns trading the MVP award for several years to come"
"To be fair doubling teaming lamelo would be dumb for a team not because he‚Äôs bad scorer but with his vision of a player is left open he‚Äôs gonna find it, double teaming a player Hassan bit to do with how good a player is it also has a lot to do with skill set on how effective or smart a double team would be, for example weak ball handlers and playmakers are often double teamed to try and make them make a mistake, so does it mean those scrubs have earned more respect than players who don‚Äôt get doubled?  this isn‚Äôt a slight to ant or saying lamelo is better but looking at it as he‚Äôs the only one who gets double teamed so he‚Äôs the best when its simply not that simple"
"&gt; We can all agree Ant doesn't have the best playmaking chops and can be forced into some bail-out shots. Until he proves he can make teams pay, other than 8 pull up 3s per game  I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt watch him play much, because he has not responded to doubles by hoisting up shots. He‚Äôs actually pretty willing to move the ball, especially in a doubling situation where it‚Äôs clearly beneficial to swing it. He‚Äôs not a passer like LaMelo or something, but he‚Äôs a very capable passer who is more than willing to give the ball up when needed.   The doubling strategy last night was not because they thought they could get some easy turnovers or force bad shots ‚Äî it was simply because they wanted to get the ball out of his hands because no other perimeter player was capable of creating like him (with D‚ÄôLo ejected and Beasley injured)."
&gt;We had that same team you just cited last year minus Hayward (who has missed a ton of time with injury) and went 23-42. LaMelo has changed the culture immediately. Look at some of the things Borrego has said about his attitude and energy and how infectious it is to all of his teammates. LaMelo has transformed this team into one that absolutely loves sharing the ball and feeding everybody else. He's just special. The Hornets do not win awards and haven't been relevant in 30 fucking years.  Yeah and you added a top 10 SF in the NBA and a top 3 pick in the draft. No shit you gonna improve lol. And yeah you had the same team but it was full of young guys who were hopefully gonna improve and take on bigger roles this year no?  I'm not denying LaMelo isn't good but it ain't all on him.
This award ain't for the last 2 months homie. In the winter when Ant was going 4-19 from the floor LaMelo was putting it on everyone.  We had that same team you just cited last year minus Hayward (who has missed a ton of time with injury) and went 23-42. LaMelo has changed the culture immediately. Look at some of the things Borrego has said about his attitude and energy and how infectious it is to all of his teammates. LaMelo has transformed this team into one that absolutely loves sharing the ball and feeding everybody else. He's just special. The Hornets do not win awards and haven't been relevant in 30 fucking years.  I'm dying on this hill. It's LaMelo. Last I checked he was -700 to win it on FanDuel. So if you wanna go make a lot of money you can go bet on Edwards. I'll take our guy.
"that‚Äôs fair, last night was fresh in my mind, and I didn‚Äôt watch the 1-10 game. I got home, saw the box score, and pretended the game didn‚Äôt happen.   Ant may be the better volume scorer, but LaMelo is better at pretty much every other facet of the game.   Ant gets 3.1 more PPG, has a .004% advantage at the line and .1 more blocks (though their per 36 are both .5) and half a turnover less.   Ball is better at literally everything else. Assists, steals, rebounds, FG% 3PT%, etc.   Advanced stats are where LaMelo really separates -   PER +4.8 OWS +2.3 DWS +.6 VORP +2  Ant is a negative in VORP, +/-"

"Guy needs time to develop. Time the warriors don‚Äôt have with aging superstars.    Seems like a good kid, raw physical ability is really good, but his skills just aren‚Äôt there. And the warriors are a really tough team to join. Draymond and Steph are playing ball at a PHD level and Wiseman is barely a high school graduate.   At this point the only hope is that he comes back strong next season after a real offseason and we can trade him for something to help us win now.  But with Lamelo balling out and looking like a future star this is looking like a big miss for Bob Myers."
"As I Hornets fan, I would just like to offer my sincere gratitude for passing up Lamelo Ball."
lamelo ball ready to make a statement
He was a massive bust at Marquette.  His high school mix tapes made him look like LaMelo Ball throwing crazy passes everywhere.
you really think Lamelo Ball will let that happen?
"Who won: Chris. This feels like the best combination of roles. True playmaker, two defend-and-defer guys who aren't useless on offense, pure scorer, and a two-way guy. Malik's team is gonna be ass on defense, Simon's team is alright but a little weak defensively (with Simmons being the only average or positive defender on the whole thing), Nate's team has worse spacing than the 2019-2020 76ers, Sasha's team is solid but I have serious doubts about a Trae/Fox backcourt due to defensive issues, and there may be too many mouths to feed on offensive.    What I would do with the same graphic:   PG: LaMelo Ball, $2  SG: SGA, $3  SF: Mikal Bridges, $1  PF: Zion Williamson, $5  C: Bam Adebayo, $3."
Zion Williamson and Allen Iverson  Lamelo Ball and Shaquille O'Neal  Tyrese Haliburton and Amare Stoudamire
"* Zion Williamson and **Chris Paul**. CP3's playmaking can help open the floor for Zion, and he won't be taking shots away from him like other ball-dominant guards. Also, the lobs would be fun. Bam Adebayo is another good option, a solid secondary playmaker who can cover for Zion's defensive limitations thanks to his versatility.  * LaMelo Ball and **Nikola Jokic**. LaMelo has thrived this year thanks to Hornets' ball-sharing system, which lets him function as a playmaker and an off-ball threat. Jokic is the perfect fit for that, even if Melo/Jokic would be serviceable at best on defense. Of course, if Melo-Jokic pick and pops aren't your speed, Melo-Zion would also be fun, again because of lobs.  * Tyrese Haliburton and **Damian Lillard**. Hali doesn't iso a lot, usually having others set up his shots for him, but is a great playmaker. Dame can create his own shot with ease, but isn't a spectacular playmaker, and can be worn down if he has to have the ball in his hands on every possession. The strengths perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Hali and Steph would also be a really fun pairing, or Hali and Jimmy Butler."

"There‚Äôs no fucking way you just compared Josh Giddey to Lamelo Ball. Goddamn this dumbass sub talking out their asses  Giddey has average passing, no athleticism, no defence, no jumper. Nowhere near Ball or Rubio."
"Born in 95 and I can't stand anyone born after 98. Just the natural order of things. Youngsters will always be weaklings, too short and be making poorest choices in my eyes even if said youngster is one LaMelo Ball."
these guys need more Lamelo Ball and less Giannis
"Ben's is 2.33 and Trae's is 2.12 [Career]  This season: Ben 2.19,  Trae 2.26  So for season barely, but this is also his lowest ATO ratio season...  They are all close, but Ben also averages less TO per 36. Doesn't have the ball in his hands for his team. Statically has better ratio.   But my point with my original statement is Ben is one of the best passers in his age range.  Ben, Luka, Trae, Jokic, Ja, Lonzo, Fox, Lamelo etc. I think there are a few guys you can argue are the ""one of the best."" I did say l was being a bit hyperbolic."
"Oh I most definitely did. I've caught a lot of Hornets games and all Wolves games. I'm just talking about the narrative around the time of the draft. Ant and Lamelo are most certainly that level of prospect knowing what we know now.   I love Hali, Pat-Wil, and IQ but I don't see them as Franchise Changers. But moreso very valuable second options. In my eyes at least Ball and Ant can lead a team.   Right now Cade-Green-Mobley-Suggs are seen as that level right now. A lot of people would still take Cade-Green-Mobley over Lamelo or Ant even knowing what they know now. I think that's bananas tho"
This is a 30 game sample size of all the most recent games. We can‚Äôt keep pretending lamelo is somehow vastly more efficient when he turns the ball over significantly more and recently has been shooting less efficiently on less volume.
He'll still never be Lamelo Ball.
&gt; oh wow 5% ts lower and better stats  Anthony is worse at 3 of the 4 stats you can see there. Sure he's scoring 3 more points but three more assists is like Ball being responsible for 28 points a night while Anthony is responsible for 25.  &gt; Ant is capable of passing and getting rebounds too.  Then wait until he actually averages better stats than LaMelo before asking if he's locked up ROY
"Sure he‚Äôs flashy and he‚Äôs going to be a star. But Anthony Edwards being just a average to good distributor (which he has been lately) is much better than ball. Edwards collapses the paint and will constantly demand a 2nd help defender. I‚Äôve watched about every game now, and I have not seen one perimeter defender that can actually guard Ant. You *need* an elite paint presence occupying the paint; which, in Utah‚Äôs case, often led to open looks for KAT on the perimeter before they had to adjust and let Gobert float around guarding Okogie (nonshooter). But even then wolves smartly adjusted with a lot of back door cuts to the paint with ant and okogie.   Edwards can take over offensively AND make others better by getting them open looks. He‚Äôs smart enough to make the right decisions too unlike early Wiggins. His ability to finish with contact is also unreal for a rookie. Lamelo makes the right plays, and winning plays. He sees plays that are already there and available to him (and identifies that better than most people already as a rookie)."
I pulled Anthony Edwards and LaMelo Ball rookie in a Donruss NBA pack. I guess its a race to see who will be worth more in 5 yrs
"I agree and I stan LaMelo but you have to agree that Ant has been something else since ASB. Even is Ball wasn't injured, I'd still take Edwards in a very close race between the two right now"
Edwards and Lamelo Ball have superstar potential.
Lamelo Ball has entered the chat
The narrative set before the season started was lamelo ball was going to win rookie of the year thats why
"I mean, I‚Äôm a wolves fan and everything, but you have to admit that Lamelo has an argument for ROTY as well. Ant has balled out for the past couple of months, but it‚Äôs a year long award. Edwards had a slow start under Ryan Saunders and his percentages and efficiency are considerably worse than Lamelo‚Äôs (who is only scoring 3ppg less than Ant). I love Edwards, and think he definitely deserves the award if he gets it, but it‚Äôs not a bad take to have Ball over him. He still played most of the season, and the narrative for success is in the hornets favor."
"I'd personally recommend watching the Charlotte Hornets next season. We missed the playoffs this season due to injuries and a stretch of bad games, but we've got a bright future building around LaMelo Ball, and I'd hop on the bandwagon before we're at the top of the league.  I also like the Timberwolves out West. Some nice talent, just they need to get healthy and figure it out. I wouldn't be surprised if they are the next surprise team like this year's Knicks team. Plus, I love their jerseys and logo.  Edit: corrected typos, I have sausage fingers"
"It‚Äôs the Big Baller Brand stuff and the Ball family (mostly Lavar). Not really fair to Lamelo but it is what it is. Seems like a good kid and obviously a great player, hope he has a long career in Charlotte."
"It could be so many other things.  You could even have it be the same glass block but say ""Rookie of the Year"" on it with a small NBA logo.  It's literally just a glass NBA logo, the only thing that makes it a rookie of the year trophy is the writing on the stand.  It shouldn't be up to us redditors to find out a better sort of trophy.  You can criticize it without having to come up with the solution in this case, it's literally just an NBA logo an a square block.  That is a terrible fucking trophy, haha.  It's like they just pulled some random ""NBA"" glass thing out of a closet and stuck it on a stand and wrote ""Rookie of the Year -- Lamelo Ball"" on the stand.    It's a terrible trophy.  You could make it a basketball shape.  You could make it a shape of some groundbreaking rookie.  You could make it just a more unique shape than a square.  You could write something on the award, or have a design more interesting than the NBA logo.  It's the NBA, they have enough money to make a cool trophy for their awards every year.  Not just an NBA advertisement glass block."
"But we can still do Lamelo Ball to Malachi Flynn comparisons, right?"
"Same, but for Lamelo Ball"
"Fuck this shit, fuck lamelo and all those fucking Ball motherfuckers. I hope Edwards dunks so fucking hard on Lamelo that the ball bounces on his face breaking his nose and then flies to hit Lavar on the sidelines breaking his nose as well."
"[The Goddess Hebe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebe_(mythology), obviously.   -	Hebe is the personification of eternal youth in Greek Mythology.  -	Much like LaMelo Ball, and other ROY‚Äôs, she has the power to revert her opponents to a childlike state.  -	Hebe was youngest of the gods and responsible for keeping them eternally young, and thus was the most revered by them.  -	Her role as cupbearer in Olympus is also a good fit for your average NBA rookie, since older players often require rooks to get them drinks  The case is clear. Personally, I think that a [marble, topless goddess double fisting wine](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Canova-Hebe_30_degree_view.jpg) would make a great NBA trophy that any Rookie would be proud to own.   Frankly, I‚Äôm not sure why Adam Silver hasn‚Äôt responded to any of my emails about this issue yet‚Ä¶"
"Because LaMelo didn‚Äôt play for 30% of the games, and because Ant was putting up ridiculous numbers in the second half for a primary scorer who is not yet 20 years old.  It is more difficult to score consistently and efficiently on high volume as a rookie than it is to accumulate counting stats in space with an army of shooters.  Putting the bullshit popularity contest for ROTY aside, I don‚Äôt think anyone who watched the Wolves this year would be willing to trade Ant for Ball straight up."
The LaMelo Ball that LeLoser ran out of LA?  That LaMelo Ball?  Who knows‚Ä¶. If LaMelo had still been around LeChallenged Hairline might not be watching the playoffs from his couchü§î.
"Charlotte is the 10th largest market in the NBA. Minny is in the bottom 25%. Lavar Ball has been a household name within NBA circles for the last 5 years. LaMelo had the most hype, played well, got hurt. Anthony Edwards played the whole year and got better as it went. LaMelo is going to be a good NBA player, Anthony Edwards is going to be a perennial All Star in the league. Keep the trophy, Ant has his eyes on a different one."
LaMelo Ball receiving ROTY award. It means game will start 7:48
Lamelo Ball plays for the charlotte hornets my man.
So I‚Äôm gonna say this and move on.  Lamelo as a starter in 31 games- 5.6 3 pointer attempts  KD in his 35 games- 5.4 attempts.  Edit:  Actually read into shit instead of going off your feelings.  YES I THINK LAMELO BALL WILL SHOOT MORE THREES THAN KD NEXT SEASON
"Media hype. If his name wasn‚Äôt lamelo ball he wouldn‚Äôt have won.  You have haliburton who‚Äôs ts%, ast/t0, offrtg, and defrtg are all better.  More games played and the exact same record.  You can‚Äôt argue media hype doesn‚Äôt play a roll."
[Lavar actually said LaMelo would be the best back in 2017](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2734967-ball-in-the-family-review-lavar-ball-says-lamelo-will-be-better-than-brothers)
I project that he‚Äôll be a little worse than Lamelo Ball. Just like this season.
"Woj: ""Lamelo Ball has been diagnosed with a tear in his left ACL.""  What? My knee doesn't even...ARGGGHHHH!     *Woj laughs manically.*"
"I think Ball will have the better career, and was more impactful this rookie season because his numbers contributed to a 45% winning percentage compared to Ant‚Äôs 32%. Also, Ant played with two recent former All-Stars(KAT and D‚ÄôLo). It‚Äôs not like Melo‚Äôs teammates were significantly better.   With that said though, I would have given the ROTY to Ant because LaMelo missed my personal 75% games played benchmark for award eligibility. And given how many players are hurt the past couple of years, staying healthy should be praised."
"yeah the only point i‚Äôm trying to make in this thread is that the media hates tanking teams. it‚Äôs a lot easier to get stats when you‚Äôre down double digits in a game versus being competitive. based on stats alone edwards wins this year, both guys had plenty of highlight plays. but the fact that lamelo won WITH injury and games missed just confirms where the voters‚Äô heads are at. that‚Äôs the only point i‚Äôm trying to make.  i never said ball was better or deserved to win."
"I find 538 RAPTOR and Bball Index's LEBRON to be the two best advanced stats publicly available. Definitely far better than RPM, VORP, PER, etc.  -  [**538 RAPTOR**](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)      LaMelo Ball:      +1.2 OFF | ‚Äì0.9 DEF | +0.3 TOTAL (+2.3 WAR)     Anthony Edwards:  ‚Äì0.5 OFF | ‚Äì2.8 DEF | -3.3 TOTAL (‚Äì0.7 WAR)  -  [**Bball Index LEBRON**](https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-database/)      LaMelo Ball:      +0.17 OFF | ‚Äì0.68 DEF | ‚Äì0.50 TOTAL     Anthony Edwards:  +0.91 OFF | ‚Äì1.81 DEF | ‚Äì0.90 TOTAL"
"Ok Ant man had a historical second half season for a rookie, Lamelo was simply not good, worse than Ant‚Äôs struggles beginning of the year. Also, Ball wasn‚Äôt the reason they made the Play-in...not sure how you reward a player that would‚Äôve placed 10th any other year."
"Look, I don't have a horse in this race like it appears you do. All I am saying is, that when you and Wolves fans say, ""Well, but ANT was way better in the second-half"" and that's the main argument, thats ""pretty crazy.""      You are saying, lets only look at the part where Melo sucked and ANT was good. But lets look at what are clearly 4 sections of the season: The Half ANT was good, The Half ANT wasnt good, The Half Ball was good, and the Half Ball Wasnt     Good Halfs:   Pre ASG Ball: 36 games, 15.8, 6.0/6.3 on 45/38/80   Post ASG ANT:  36 games, 23.8/5.3/3.4 on 45/35/76     Bad Halfs:   Post ASG Ball: 16 games, 15.6/5.7/5.8 on 41/29/69   Pre ASG ANT: 36 games , 14.9/4.0/2.5 on 37/30/80  If your argument is that ""Lamelo was worse when he was worse,"" then you have a problem. Because in the halves of the season where they didnt play well, respectively, they shot nearly the same, but Ball had more ppg, rpg and apg. Now yes, ANT played more games, so there is that, but the argument could be made that Ball still had better stats while ""bad"" and with a injured wrist than ANT did while healthy.  And if you want to add that ANT's great half of the season was better than Ball's good half, well, you might have a problem there as well, since while he has a nice edge in scoring, Ball takes him in rpg, apg and slightly better shooting."
"Facts if people really look at the stats. Lamelo‚Äôs worst (coming back from injury of his shooting wrist) is better than Edwards‚Äô worst(first 35 games). If you look at lamelos stats since he became a starter and Edwards‚Äô stats after the all star game, Lamelo‚Äôs is still better.   Idk if it‚Äôs recency bias that‚Äôs making people feel like Edwards is roty but he just wasn‚Äôt the better player statistically for the entire year. Lmao not to mention Edwards only ended the season leading in points and blocks. Every other major and advance metric of a basically player shows Lamelo having the better, more impactful season.  Maybe I care more about stats then just the Ball brother and Lavar ball hate."
Imagine the reaction you would have gotten here 4-5 years ago if you said LaMelo Ball would be a future ROTY.
Lamelo Ball has been ruled out for the Western Conference Finals
"Lamelo does more than score the ball, just saying."
"Man, take it easy man, I was respectful. It's just an award. Ant did play poorly for the first part of the season, in the games against us, for example, he was completely awful, but then he was good. You got to consider also that he was basically the focal point of the Wolves, while LaMelo had to share the ball a lot more. Again, I'm not saying I completely disagree with you, I'm just trying to peacefully make you understand another point of view, different from yours, that's it man ü§ù"
"Don‚Äôt worry, stats don‚Äôt matter to a ‚ÄúKeeping up with the Ball Brothers‚Äù on FB tv fan, dude probably thinks Lamelo is the GOAT."
Barring injuries both Ball Brothers are going to make well over $100 million in their careers. LaMelo has a chance to make exponentially more than that because he looks like he'll be a perennial max contract guy. Lavar did something right.
Lamelo Ball has more instagram followers than Patrick Mahomes or Zion Williamson.
Bullshit tbh. Lamelo was garbage since returning from injury while Edwards played amazing ball
"Charlotte Hornets guard LaMelo Ball has been voted the NBA‚Äôs Rookie of the Year, sources tell ESPN. Announcement expected soon."
On r/nba? The same people that had threads asking if you'd take Lu Dort and Lamelo Ball over Trae? Never.
I was thinking the same. Although then Im guessing they will be compared more than Lamelo Ball and Malachi Flynn.
"I think Magic over Kobe for LAL.    Definitely Jokic over Melo now - 4 years ago when people were saying that Jokic overtook Melo I was like ""slow down, dude hasn't even been to the playoffs yet"", but Jokic has played in two less playoff games as a Nugget than Melo did, despite Melo making 7 playoffs and Jokic only making 3.  Plus Jokic has been an MVP and Melo was never really in that discussion in Denver.  Gilbert Arenas for Washington is flat out disrespectful.  Wes Unseld and Elvin Hayes are both 50 Greatest Players of Time, and won a title in Washington.  Same with LaMelo Ball. Come on now, Kemba did so much more in Charlotte than LaMelo has (currently) done."
Lamelo Ball for Hornets lol
"So did Lamelo Ball so according to the OP, we shouldn't consider Lamelo for any all nba teams because he missed 21 games, even though its clear he's the roty and is going to mean an all nba rookie team."
Lamelo Ball is just another version of Nick young.  and that was my own take lol
"Jokic is basically already there, as is Luka. Luka is closer to Lebron than CP3 because of how potent a scorer he is, but all 4 share the ability to control the pace of the game, pick the defense apart, and orchestrate the offense. Lamelo is an easy answer because he's the only real point guard among them, but I'd argue Lamelo so far has only shown that he's a willing and brilliant passer, not necessarily an in-game manager. He's obviously only a rookie so he's got room to grow, but I think the distinction is worth mentioning.   Part of the problem I think is that in the modern NBA basically everyone is a competent ball handler in a way that just wasn't true even 5 years ago. It used to be that the PF and C positions were true bigs who needed to be fed the ball, and the best passers among them could pass out of the post or at the top of the key only after being fed the ball. Today we have multiple centers who are bringing the ball up themselves, and the PF position is functionally dead. When you have 4-5 guys on the floor who can all put the ball on the floor, it decreases the absolute need for a true point guard to run the show. That doesn't mean things devolve into iso ball (think the old Spurs teams or the current Jazz), but it means teams can get away without a true PG."

"Since you‚Äôre having trouble joining the dots, I shall assist  Relating Ayton to Wiseman because when Ayton was drafted in the same draft class ahead of luka and luka came out of the gate dominating, Ayton was labeled as a bust. But has turned into a big contributor and is definitely not a bust. The original comment relating Ayton to Wiseman is because of the hopeful similarity that now lamelo ball is getting all the attention even though drafted behind wiseman(similar to luka and ayton), so the hope(for warriors fans) is that they follow similar story arc and wiseman also turns out like Ayton  Can‚Äôt believe I have to spell it out like that, I thought it was obvious."
"Seen him owning other big guys in chino hills while watching lamelo ball. How times have changed, he getting owned in the big leagues now"

On god. If I was starting a franchise right now I would take lamelo ball over Rudy gobert. I could realistically make an argument for at least 30 players I would start a team with before him
imagine lamelo ball with donovan üëçüèº
"1 - Luka  2 - Donovan (Biased, I know)  3 - Tatum  4 - Ja  5 - Trae  6 - Zion  7 - Ayton  8 - SGA  9 - Fox  10 - Bam  11 - MPJ  12 - Anthony Edwards  13 - Lamelo Ball  14 - Mikal Bridges  15 - Sexton"
"Uh, right now history has shown the ones who want to be good go to college. Other than LaMelo Ball, ""go pro in Europe or Australia"" route for these kids has failed, miserably."
I don't think thats true of Zion. And Lamelo Ball is a pretty unique case. No one gave a shit about R.J. Hampton.
"Right but fanbases can come via other means. You're looking at it from a purely American standpoint of 'this is how we do it, so this is the only way it can work'.  All over the world it's been proven you can develop secondary fanbases for minor divisions as long as you have the talent.   The fans will go where the talent goes and the talent will go where the opportunities are.   LaMelo Ball had kids watching the Australian Basketball League. Zion was going to be Zion whether he was in Duke or Ignite."
I think a lot of people panicked because there wasn‚Äôt immediate success. But players like that need a bit to develop. But who else was there? LaMelo? He don‚Äôt help the Warriors. He‚Äôs another guy who needs the ball in his hands. Wiseman will be able to impact the game without the basketball. Which will fit better when they‚Äôre actually all healthy
"I believe the result is a reddit victory story. I remember vividly there was a post comparing Lamelo Ball and Giannis' free throw side by side where Giannis failed to shoot the first before Ball finish both. It was on front page, and like just a week after, the violation call happened and you can see the ref is on it the second Giannis gets the ball, and you can tell he's a redditor.    https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n5e4lq/highlight\_in\_the\_time\_it\_took\_giannis\_to\_shoot/"
"Lamelo has more insta followers. Therefore, Ball &gt; 30 year old rookie"
"I mean... Fox and Lamelo are good young players and all, but CP3 is an all-time great floor general and someone that all of these other all-stars will respect.  If one of those PGs drops out, its going to be Ben Simmons, Lowry, or Kyrie.  You'd only take Fox or Ball if you're trying to bring more young guys into the international game that than field the best team we can."
"LaMelo Ball, even tho the thought makes me cringe"
"Hot take. Zion is boring. Upcoming stars like Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball, etc... are way more entertaining to watch."
you leave Lamelo Ball and friends alone
"While I'm sure he's glad to have LaMelo Ball, who looks sensational, I'm sure he would have liked if his team would have advanced beyond the play-ins."

Warriors radio is talking about how the team should have drafted Lamelo Ball. Steph isn't a floor general like CP3 is. There are so few of those in the NBA.
"LeBron got nothing left in the tank. Even if the Lakers get healthy next year, these emerging young teams are gonna easily surpass them and especially these already established contender teams. I think we just saw the last ring LeBron will ever win in the NBA last year's playoffs.  LeBron ultimately falling short with 4-6 record in the finals and solidifying LaMelo LaFrance Ball as the GOAT in the NBA."
Give up LaMelo Ball for Simmons then ?
Only a select few remember a time when Michael Porter Jr and Lamelo Ball looked like brothers
"1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young  I love Trae, but this list isn't absurd.   There's a few positions I would change but a lot of those guys don't have the physical limitations Trae does.  I do think, just like many others on this list, Trae has HoF potential."
* Buddy Hield * Kelly Oubre Jr * LaMelo Ball
Lamelo ball took his team further than lowry did this year what are you kn
"When I think the best passing style I think the Warriors from a couple years back or the Spurs. The Warriors should be strong again next year and the Spurs should always play a good style as long as Pop is coaching. A couple of the top young exciting playmakers now are Luka Doncic from the Mavericks and Lamelo Ball from the Hornets. Jokic from Denver is an amazing passer, too. I'm biased as a fan but I think the Raptors will be back to playing an entertaining, hard nosed and unselfish style next year and really as long as Nick Nurse is coaching there.  I highly recommend you get NBA League Pass. You can stream every game plus they have highlights, stats, condensed games, different streams for each team's announcers, and other features. You could watch a few condensed games or highlight packages to get a feel for a team, and then dive into full games. Another feature is you can hide the scores if you don't want to have a game spoiled before you watch it. I swear I don't work for them lol just think it's a really good package, especially for someone who might have trouble watching games live."
"Well we missed the playoffs, but next season you might really like watching the Hornets. We were one of the top teams in assists per game this year and have a pass heavy style in general.   Plus we‚Äôre a young team that plays at a fast pace, which is really exciting when paired with our awesome announcer Eric Collins.   LaMelo Ball has been an amazing rookie for us this year too and easily has at least one highlight worthy pass a game (his playmaking is incredible at only 19 years old). So you might enjoy watching!"
PG - LaMelo Ball  SG - Donovan Mitchell  SF - Jimmy Butler  PF - Julius Randall  C - DeAndre Ayton
LaMelo Ball
"The other one is behind a paywall, but [here's the list.](https://nesn.com/2021/04/espns-top-under-25-nba-list-has-jayson-tatum-behind-lamelo-ball/)"
"As of now, I'm 2 for 2 on the Ball brothers. When Lonzo was getting hyped as the next great point guard, I thought he was overrated and wouldn't be a star. With LaMelo, I thought he was gonna be the best player out of his draft class. We'll see how that goes."
LOL lamelo before these guys? Lavar ball did the list?
"You‚Äôre not wrong. When the Ball brothers face off, LaMelo reminds Lonzo that LaVar liked spooning him better"
But lamelo ball is the better under 25 player according to espn. ROFL

"Are you talking about the Lamelo Ball one? I actually posted that for him haha it definitely was bad enough that a tech would‚Äôve been justified but this dude is just gonna fight back rn so there‚Äôs not much point in keeping it up. Oh well, Lakers won so I‚Äôm happy!"
Well I didn‚Äôt say they could do it without Gordon Hayward or Lamelo Ball for the remainder of the season.

"After seeing Lamelo in the first few months, was pretty certain that he‚Äôd give a surprisingly good losing effort to a contender in the playoffs. Dude looked so professional and did all the role player things consistently on top of his highlight plays.   Things went sideways in the last few weeks, tho. He complained to the refs more, played more hero ball than before and had really bad body language. Felt like he suddenly lost all the maturity he showed earlier in the season.   Hope the team bounces back next season because they‚Äôre very exciting to watch when fully healthy."
Lamelo Ball
"Not if he doesn‚Äôt win a title. There will be plenty of guys getting gaudy stats like Luka. If one of those guys also gets rings while doing it, they will pass Luka.    Kobe is a good example of where you‚Äôre drafted completely dictates your path. Yes Kobe was also great but if you swap his draft situation with Tmac it‚Äôs a different ball game   Guys i could see surpassing Luka as player of the decade if they luck into the right setting:   -Tatum (Luka may never have a sidekick better then Jaylen brown)  -Lamelo,   -Trae Young   -Jokic (in 2 years if both LA teams are out the way, Jokic could have the best team in the west and 2 all star sidekicks in Murray and MPJ). Simile to how Kobe had better stats than Duncan but Duncan to many had the better career , I could see happening   -The wild card is OKC. They could have a team that‚Äôs like (ironically) the old OKC with lottery picks after lottery picks. If one of those picks is an Emoni bates or Case Cunningham , they could be just as good as Luka AND have a stacked supporting cast and start taking over the league the 2nd half of the decade   Remind me! 5 years"
He is on my team and is my favorite player to watch but LaMelo Ball interviews are some of the least insightful things ive ever watched lmfao
I would take LaMelo ball and Trae Young very very very easily over the rest. Trae is already there and I think LaMelo has whatever ‚Äúit‚Äù is. He‚Äôs gonna be grant hill to his max potential
1. Trae Young (MVP potential) 2. Ja Morant  (MVP potential) 3. De‚ÄôArron Fox 4. Lamelo Ball (MVP potential) 5. Anthony Edwards  6. SGA  7. Rj
Meanwhile LaMelo getting mentored by the GOAT himself Lavar Ball. Step yo game up GSW.
Timberwolves fan would mention ant but not roty lamelo ball
Is Hero-Ball the adopted child of Tyler and Lamelo?
Malachi Flynn vs LaMelo Ball
"Those people aren't known for taking care of the ball. And Lamelo is a rookie, definitely not worth bragging about."
When Trae Young starts running around dribbling he looks like LaMelo Ball in high school lol
"There‚Äôs a lot of nuance involved at that level. If you‚Äôre a play-off team chasing a championship then it makes sense to trade the late first round pick for a player who can instantly contribute. The Nets traded the pick for Shamet because they knew he could stick in the league and was on his rookie contract. If the Nets win this year they should keep this years first because you need to add players who can earn playing time but are on a rookie deal so you go with a guy who only needs to contribute in a limited way like be a 3&amp;D player. Or you draft a player and develop him on your G-League team and sign ring chasing vets to fill out the roster.  The Warriors would probably like a do-over on the Wiseman pick. They like him a lot as a person, high character type of person with huge potential and the type of bridge player who can link the current GSW dynasty to the next dynasty. Maybe he will be that player but big men take longer to develop.  The pandemic screwed the Warriors at the last draft but they still made their decision. Anthony Edwards has definitely surpassed expectations this season but would he have excelled as much with Step and Wiggins next to him and with Klay coming back? I imagine Lavarr Ball put the Warriors off wanting to be associated with that family and Lonzo really only improved this season. But LaMelo or Ant Edwards would look great right now on the Warriors.  The Warriors should have also tried to send the number 2 pick and the upcoming Minnesota pick to a rebuilding team for a guy who could play for them this season."
Lol basketball casuals talking about 17-0 fts. Yall probably don‚Äôt watch or even hoop. One team drives and one team shoots. What do you expect? Yall probably know everything about basketball from bleacherreport and houseofhighlights and think lamelo ball is the goat. When dude played only 50 games and has 145 turnovers on the season
how did andre drummond being gifted FTs he can't hit escalate into lamelo ball hate lmao lakers fans break the IQ scale
So‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ a LaMelo Ball?
LaMelo Ball?  no
"The reason a lot of younger siblings tend to be more successful is because they have to pull above their weight from an early age, but once you start hyping them up as the best, maybe they lose that underdog mentality a little bit and aren‚Äôt as driven as a Reggie Miller or Lamelo Ball. Idk it‚Äôs something to think about."
That's why I think Lonzo and Lamelo are quite close right now in on court production. Obviously Lamelo has a much higher ceiling but I think teams with a ball dominant PnR star would much rather Lonzo than Lamelo
"I think the question is do you think you could get something more valuable for him? He's a productive player \*\*when healthy (which deserves more \*s than I can type) and having that consistency next to younger players could be helpful to stabilize a bit of the rotation while the young guns figure things out. I don't think he's such a ball dominator that it will take away from Lamelo vs what he adds.   Also, my guess is his value on the trade market isn't very high since he's been hurt so much."
"Lebron + Lamelo Ball.   Just need LBJ to take LaMelo‚Äôs youth and hold back Father Time a bit longer.  Edit:Whoops, misread this but I guess the logic would be the same with AD &amp; LBJ. LBJ to get younger or AD to be more durable."
"Pretty crazy how many young players are elite passers in the league now.   Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, LaMelo Ball, Ben Simmons, Ja Morant, etc.   Seems like we have been getting a steady influx of players beyond their years for passing/playmaking"
it's not even going small ball either. Lonzo is about 6'6 and Lamelo around 6'7
Up to date power rankings of all the Balls.  1) LaMelo Ball  2) Lonzo Ball  3) Basketball  4) LiAngelo Ball
"How do they not make sense with each other? LaMelo is a better half-court PG and great finisher. Lonzo is a 3&amp;D guy that can pass in transition, he fits perfectly next to LaMelo. Lonzo is not a half-court PG that needs the ball in his hands.   I mean I agree with you that the Hornets definitely should not use all their cap space to sign him but you say they make no sense next to each other when in fact their games compliment each other well."
"i like terry a lot too, don't get me wrong. But I don't think the problem with the hornets is scoring, and i think you can use rozier as a closer while playing him from the bench.   I think if you have Lamelo Lonzo and Gordon as your backcourt, you have so much defensive presence and passing ability. But, to your point, no breakthrough scorer... cuz rozier is the best bucket getter on the team.  I think Lonzo as a backup guard could work by pairing him with Graham. But Lonzo works best with a primary ball handler, which lamelo is, and lonzo gets to work as an off-ball facilitator.  Yeah it's a tough one, but I'd start Lonzo and Lamelo, and figure out what to do about Rozier and Hayward. Do you want more scoring, go with Rozier. And Hayward has the additional benefit of playing as a small ball 4."
"Lol Lamelo has always been like this. I‚Äôve been half following the ball family on and off for 4ish years and at every life stage he‚Äôs goes 120% harder then his peers into slang. His friends, the ones his own age, speak like normal humans, just with whatever slang is popular. I‚Äôve been fascinated by it, because I don‚Äôt actually think he‚Äôs a moron, at least no more so then his brothers who also don‚Äôt speak like this, he seems to have just fallen in love with it."
"Why does the Lonzo, the larger ball, not simply eat Lamelo?"
Dammit just bought my friend a Lamelo #2 jersey today *facepalm* dont tell me it‚Äôs a Lonzo ball jersey now
Lonzo Ball got drafted then he bought Lamelo a lambo for his 16th birthday I think
"I'm not at all really sold on the idea, as I don't really see the fit.   If you let Lonzo play the 2, he's not nearly as great of a scorer as Terry is in that position. LaMelo definitely isnt as well.   If you play either of them at the 3, you completely make no use out of Gordon Hayward (when healthy).   LaMelo at the 4 and Lonzo at the 1 is something I'd do in 2K, and itd probably be fun as hell, but I know it's not at all practical. Plus, I'd like to see Miles play starter minutes at the 4 next year.   I like the idea of the Ball Brothers together, because the hype would be stupid, and LaVar would lose his mind out of pure bliss. But I don't think we're the team for this.   We have so many other problems to deal with, getting another guard isnt one of them. Please, someone free me from watching Cody Zeller, Biz, and PJ at the 5. We've needed a real C for the last 5 years."
Sorry LeBron Curry of the Miami Lakers couldn‚Äôt be facing off against Kawhi Durant and rookie LaMelo Ball on the New York Warrior-Nets you fucking casual
"Kemba Walker, LaMelo Ball, Gordon Hayward, Nicolas Batum, Bismack Biyombo"
"Nope  Not that Lamelo is a bad player, in fact I think he will be a superstar in this league. But he doesn‚Äôt fit our system at all, so his development wouldn‚Äôt be nearly the same as what we saw on the hornets, especially since he wouldn‚Äôt be as ball dominant with us as he is with Charlotte"
westbrook and lamelo ball would be the most fun
"This kid's handles look so inaccurate and just slow in general, if he plays the same kind of ISO - slash n' shoot game he forced in college but in the NBA, he's going to just get eaten alive.  Check out like college highlights of Jamal Murray or Lamelo in Euro league if you wanna see how sloppy this dude looks. Even Jaylen Brown in college looked cleaner. He's maybe a great guard one day with some work, but having this much hype on yourself when you don't got the ball on a rope ain't a good sign."
"Charlotte also has lamelo, graham and rozier already.  Idk that Lonzo is better than any of them.  Although I understand the allure of putting the ball bros together"
"Pop choosing his own player in Keldon Johnson over other, better young American guards like Trae Young, De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, or even LaMelo Ball is just laughable. Not that I'm surprised after Pop chose Derrick fucking White over Fox for the terrible 2019 FIBA team lol what a joke."
"I think you swap Trae to 3, him or zion is a toss up to me as of today. I just can‚Äôt tell how good Zion can be because I don‚Äôt understand what the   pelicans are doing around zion. You could debate him and Trae at 2 or 3. 4 for LaMelo seems accurate based on the playoffs and a perimeter ball handler who creates being a massive impact. After that it‚Äôs a grab bag of take your high level prospect with some hole in their game you hope they fix."
"I nominate Lonzo Ball, LiAngelo Ball and Lamelo Ball. Last time they played together, they were undefeated"
Lamelo Ball this year almost help dragged the Hornet to Playoff.   But to compare him to Fox and Westbrook is still too early. There can be a case of Lamelo vs SGA from this year performance and that's it.
"I have a lebron cavs jersey a Lavine jersey a Lamelo ball jersey and a Lonzo lakers jersey, I‚Äôve got more jerseys from other teams then my own team lol"
LaMelo Ball is the right answer.
tldr; Dubs F'd up and should have picked LaMelo Ball
"Here are some I‚Äôve heard. Drummond&gt;valanciunas this year. Lamelo ball is better than SGA, Fox, and Westbrook this year. Ja and trae are both better than curry. Ayton&gt;jokic. Jamal Murray&gt;luka."
"John Collins- Hawks, they‚Äôll likely match whatever, and it‚Äôs better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he‚Äôs in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that‚Äôs even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I‚Äôll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
"Well Lamelo isn't a score first kind of guard. He does need the ball in his hands to be effective though, which means less offense being run through someone like KD or Lillard which probably isn't what Team USA wants. I also recall Melo already turning down and invite for the Olympics, maybe the select team."
I‚Äôve been assured Giddey is going to be LaMelo Ball‚Ä¶
"What does Lamelo bring to the table that we don‚Äôt already have? We should be looking at glue guys, not another scorer who wants the ball. We should go get a defensive big or something.  Hell I‚Äôd rather have the other ball brother. Lamelo is a better player in a vacuum, but that‚Äôs not what this is about."
"LaMelo isn't even the best push the pace, pass first PG named Ball."
"LaMelo Ball might be fun. The team has scoring, they need playmaking"
lamelo ball (as suggested by Bill Simmons)
"Lamelo Ball, then trade him for a superstar like tatum to pair with Dame."
"Something's gonna happen in Brooklyn. Either Harden or Irving is leaving,  Lamelo Ball is top 5 in MVP voting.  Jimmy Butler or Spo leaves the Heat. I see spo taking Pat Riley's job and then whoever is coming in as head coach gets into it with Jimmy he leaves.  Markelle Fultz coming out party. 25ppg  Knicks implode or get Zack Lavine from chicago  &amp;#x200B;  And that's all I have"
Lamelo ball is a better point guard than John Stockton. Prolly lonzo too. Pistol Pete is up there.
Yeah only arguable ones I see are    Rudy Gobert vs Donovan Mitchell   Myles Turner vs Domantas Sabonis   Pascal Siakam vs Kyle Lowry   Gordon Hayward vs LaMelo Ball
1. Nets - Kevin Durant 2. Bucks - Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Lakers - LeBron James 4. Warriors - Stephen Curry 5. Clippers - Kawhi Leonard 6. Nuggets - Nikola Jokic 7. 76ers - Joel Embiid 8. Mavericks - Luka Doncic 9. Blazers - Damian Lillard 10. Celtics - Jayson Tatum 11. Suns - Chris Paul 12. Heat - Jimmy Butler 13. Hawks - Trae Young 14. Wolves - Karl-Anthony Towns 15.

Knicks - Julius Randle 22. Pacers - Domantas Sabonis 23. Raptors - Kyle Lowry 24. Grizzlies - Ja Morant 25. Spurs - DeMar DeRozan 26. Cavaliers - Collin Sexton 27. Magic - Jonathan Isaac 28. Rockets - Christian Wood 29. Pistons - Jerami Grant 30. Hornets - LaMelo Ball  This was tough
"Schroeder is not top ten. Not close.  The list.  Luka, CP3, Fox, Ja, Lowry, Curry, Westbrook, Kyrie, Trae Young, Lillard  The actual list of best PG's in the NBA has dropped off a bit cause Westbrook is gonna fall fast off the list soon, and I think Conley and Kemba are done in terms of being top ten guys, but in there place there could be ascendant guys asap, like Suggs, Cunningham, SGA, Dejounte Murray, FVV, Lonzo or Lamelo Ball, etc.  I'm sure I'm missing someone. Edit: That person is not D'lo."
Lamelo ball.
"We're talking about *currently*, not a few years ago.  He doesn't even crack the top 10.  Most recent rankings:  1. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets  2. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  3. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  5. Russell Westbrook, Washington Wizards  6. Luka Donƒçiƒá, Dallas Mavericks  7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  8. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  9. Steven Adams, New Orleans Pelicans  10. Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics  He's behind *Jaylen fucking Brown*."
Rondo would be amazing on this team. even LaMelo ball.
This team needs Lamelo Ball and Terry Rozier
From 2020-2029?   1. Luka Doncic  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo   3. Zion Williamson  4. Emoji Bates  5. Jayson Tatum  6. Trae Young  7. Ja Morant  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Karl-Anthony Towns  10.

LaMelo Ball  21. Deandre Ayton  22. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  23. Jaylen Brown  24. Bam Adebayo  25. Jalen Green
"Is he in the tier with Dame and Luka like you had mentioned, no obviously not. Is he in the tier with Tatum and Mitchell, he might be, if he‚Äôs not he‚Äôs definitely closer than you make him out to be.  This wasn‚Äôt even the original point. The original point made was that Booker right now is not top 20 and he‚Äôs not good at defense, therefor he has no chance of ever being an MVP.  Anthony Edwards and Lamelo Ball are 19 years old. Both are not top 20 and are defensive liabilities, yet how can we rule them out from being MVP candidates one day?   I agree in saying we need to wait until they hit their prime to see if they can be MVP‚Äôs, but saying they have the *Potential* to get their one day isn‚Äôt illegal"

"Call me biased, but LaMelo Ball has been really run to watch. His shooting form is unorthodox, but it works and he is a team first passer with White Chocolate flashiness"
What a surprise seein u hate on a lamelo ball post
what a weird thing to say. Lamelo wasn‚Äôt even the ball brother that stole something.
Because everyone in here is 12 years old with Lamelo Ball as their goat.
[DaBaby] LaMelo Ball signs a 20 year contract with the Charlotte Hornets
LaMelo Ball is a stud
Should get LaMelo Ball on team USA.  Fuck it even Rondo.
"It depends what you're looking for, but before anything else since you're in Europe if you want to watch any games live make sure it's an Eastern Conference team otherwise the scheduling will be extremely unkind.  I personally think the Pistons, Hornets or Hawks are the most fun Eastern teams for a new fan.  Pistons - their rookies performed really well this year, and they've got the consensus number 1 pick of the draft Cade Cunningham likely joining their team. They had a miserable year team-record wise, but are potentially only a couple of years away off being scary once their young players gain experience.  Hornets - They got rookie of the year LaMelo Ball, and without his injury would likely have made the playoffs this year. LaMelo is really fun to watch, and there could be a lot of off-season movement around him as they build a future contender.  Hawks - Young team with superstar-in-the-making Trae Young, who is not only extremely fun to watch but does cool shit like shushing crowds, shimmying, and talking friendly trash. His supporting cast have all shown heaps of potential, and are all like &lt;23. They made the conference finals this year, and it honestly looks like they can only get better every year."
I usually don't pay attention to commercials unless it involves Lamelo Ball being sunk into an abyss in the MCU.

"&gt;But he wasn't a year younger than everyone last year, so why would he be this year ? I mean he was literally only 17 days younger than Lamelo Ball.   But compared to his draft generation he was. You had a few people who reclassified but compared to the vast majority of freshmen he was a year younger."
"But he wasn't a year younger than everyone last year, so why would he be this year ?  I mean he was literally only 17 days younger than Lamelo Ball.   He still wouldn't go ahead of the top 3 this year. That's not even up for debate."
"Just because Lebron is still so popular, they'll switch names. KD is so easy to villify for example, but also talk up his greatness.  Then there's Luka and Zion, they have their things they can focus on to either hype them up or tear them down. Jokic and Giannis are a bit more difficult as they don't have too much drama around them, maybe Giannis for his FT/Shooting. Then you have Lamelo Ball or Trae Young, who they can always say they need to do more or whatever that means.  Plenty of options."
Literally just watch the first ten seconds of a tweet and proclaim Lamelo Ball the greatest prospect since Lonzo Ball
Must have confused him with Lamelo Ball
"Now that the path has been laid, how long until Gelo Ball grifts a pelicans roster spot to keep LaMelo happy?"
D'Angelo Russell and Lamelo ball....?
Lamelo Ball hmm
Zion Williamson - 28/10 on 62/30/72 shooting  DeAndre Hunter - 15/4 on 45/35/85  RJ Barrett - 18/6/4 on 45/37/77  Ja Morant - 21/4/8 on 43/32/74  Mikal Bridges - 13/5 on 50/40/85  Cam Reddish - 10/5 on 38/31/80  Kevin Porter Jr. - 18/3/7 on 41/30/76  Anthony Edwards - 22/4/4 on 43/35/80  LaMelo Ball - 16/7/8 on 44/37/78  James Wiseman - 14/9 on 55/33/70  Patrick Williams - 11/6 on 46/37/72  Onyeka Okongwu - 7/7 on 60/-/60  Tyrese Halliburton - 14/4/6 on 45/40/85  Killian Hayes - 11/3/6 on 37/34/80
"Obviously you add more pieces that fit, but Lamelo imo would‚Äôve been a key player in Warriors small ball line up for years too come, and he would‚Äôve been the perfect player to bridge the gap between helping curry win games now and have a franchise pg to take over the warriors after Curry is gone.   I think if they drafted Lamelo, Curry, Wiggins, Dray would‚Äôve made the playoffs this year and have something to build with next season.   If Lamelo doesn‚Äôt work out then a Lamelo, 7 pick, Wiggins trade package can get you about anything."
LaMelo Ball seems like the only player that can have a leap that will outshine everyone's progress in the league
"Lamelo isnt gonna make it with all the guards and hes playing behind alot of guys to share the ball with, hes gonna average like 19/6/7"
You should support the Hornets and become a massive LaMelo Ball fan
"I like:  - Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounpo because they sound like Greek Gods   - Also Lonzo Ball because that's just a perfect name for an NBA player (LaMelo is such a stupid first name that it cancels out the Ball last name)   - Steph and Seth Curry also got some nice names  - Danilo Galinari and Rajon Rondo are also great, as you mentioned  - I also like Rudy Gobert when spoken in a heavy French accent  - J.R. Smith is dope too even if it's kinda basic"
Lonzo and LaMelo Ball.
Missed opportunity to say ‚ÄúLaMelo Ball is RAW BALLING THIS MODEL‚Äù
"Because everyone knows ""dating"" = fucking  They won't come out and say ""LaMelo Ball is FUCKING THIS MODEL RAW"""
Trea Young 2023  Lamelo Ball 2029
"Anthony Edwards, Lamelo ball, Zion. these guys have a chance at it."
"Lonzo Liangelo and Lamelo team up together on the Denver Nuggets, coached by Lavar Ball and light up Ball Arena by winning 4 straight titles"
"Yea like I was so embarrassed to have the raps that I didn‚Äôt even watch ball until we won. Well I did, but at playoff parties and it basically turned into watching Bron every time . Hornets fans should be excited they‚Äôre chilling with scarey tearey, lamelo and bridges"
"I like what Charlotte did though. Hayward plays well with LaMelo, and it helps LaMelo's development playing with a secondary ball handler who can score. When Hayward's contract is over Melo will be a bonafide star and guys like Monk and Bridges look like they'll be really good too."
"I think my story on Gigi Bryant is the story I am most proud of. It is really different than the piece I had most fun writing (LaMelo Ball stories), because with Gigi, I cried writing it, I cried reporting it. It was really difficult to call her friends--also minors, grieving--and ask them about their memories of her. I felt a big weight to honor her spirit and who she was, and I constantly worried about failing. I'm proud of that story because it centered HER. Not her dad, not anyone else. HER."
"My favorite profile I've written is LaMelo Ball in Lithuania. This was my favorite because it was the most terrifying to accomplish. I had never flown out of the country by myself, I didn't have a translator, and everything had gone wrong once I got to Lithuania. It taught me to be tough, resourceful, and optimistic. Sometimes you have to take what you are given and persevere. I liked seeing LaMelo at  that stage because I couldn't imagine the pressure he was under. He was so young. He was really a child thrown into a man's game. Seeing how he handled that with grace was fascinating to me."
i didn't delete anything but just don't go back and look at my LaMelo Ball takes
At this point last year no one thought LaMelo Ball was going to ball tf out
We‚Äôll probably forget his name the moment he retires tbh   He never once beat LaMelo Ball in the playoffs in his entire career
"Deandre Ayton did have a good first two years but you look at him now compared to his rookie season and his defense is much improved, his shot selection is better, he's really starting to find the ways he can be most effective helping his team at the NBA level.   While I will agree he had a better rookie season than Wiseman but Wiseman got screwed out of a college season, Ayton got a full college season at Arizona which definitely helped his game, he entered the league before COVID got the full summer camp experience, full training camp, didn't catch COVID (Wiseman caught it right before the season started though didn't have a bad case apparently).   All of that stuff matters for a 19 year old big man. Bigs take the most time to develop. But I saw Wiseman improve, sometimes literally from one game to the next. Wiseman has shown a lot of great flashes his rookie year, a few plays taking the ball from the back court to finish in transition with his long strides, straight line quickness and length, we've seen he's got the foundations of a real 3pt shot, and his physical tools are elite. Once he gets the timing and spacing down he's going to be a premier rim defender.   I know overall opinion is down on Wiseman, I know the guards like Ant and LaMelo played pretty well this season, but I still believe Wiseman is going to be great."
"downvoted all year in our sub for saying we should have taken lamelo.   God damn would he be perfect for the future of our team. We desperately need a second ball handler, he's 6'7 and will be a decent defender if his brother is any indication, and he could allow steph and klay to come off screens until they're 40."
Punks like lamelo ball can‚Äôt be coached but proper players can be coached - I‚Äôd never pick a lamelow lazy bum player
"Yea that‚Äôs reasonable, but the same could be said for greens very small body and meh defense, and suggs bad jump shot as things thatd need time to develop.   Mobley can end up being the most impactful rookie defender and as a player who doesnt need the ball can work to make productive nba minutes. Obviously wiseman is a example of a big failing as a rookie and one who needs significant time, while mitchell, and lamelo are guards who made significant impact year 1."
Didn‚Äôt lamelo ball do this lol
LaMelo Ball on James Wiseman
"Definitely a much newer nominee than a lot of the ones being mentioned here, but LaMelo Ball was must watch tv for me at the beginning of the season. The passing vision and ability just makes him a human highlight reel."
"&gt; It‚Äôs been 1 year‚Ä¶ lamelo isn‚Äôt on the floor if Klay is healthy and wiseman has the potential to fill a hole on the roster. If you know that Klay is going to tear his Achilles, then sure maybe you go for lamelo.  imma have to push back hard on this. in the regular season, sure, he comes off the bench, which he did in charlotte to pretty good success. but he definitely would play at the end of games. remember that the warriors are best when draymond plays the 5. steph-lamelo-klay-wiggins-dray would make for an awesome small-ball/crunch-time/playoffs lineup.  regardless, when you're picking that high, you go for the best player available. even then, considering the necessity of playing draymond at the 5, picking a center with #2 still doesn't make sense if the goal is to win now.  if their evaluation was that wiseman was better than lamelo then that's inexcusable. wiseman's feel for the game is no better than damian jones's. i think it's more likely than not he ends up a bust."
"Charlotte already has their point guard of the future in LaMelo, Rozier &amp; Graham are additional ball-handlers, which means if Ben Simmons doesn't have the ball in hands, then he's not that worth it. Likewise, while Ben has his positives on the defensive-end, PJ Washington is the Perfect 4 for the way Borrego and the Hornets want to play. Hayward getting traded is very possible, I just don't imagine it being for Simmons."
Exactly. Lamelo would fit anywhere and anybody who disagrees is lying. We‚Äôre talking about a 6‚Äô6 point guard who can consistently shoot the ball.
There are like 2 players on the Warriors who can actually dribble the ball and one of them is Wiggins who can‚Äôt create for others or consistently shoot off the dribble. LaMelo would have been great for Golden State.
1. Lowry  2. Simmons  3. Conley  4. Murray (assuming he comes back 100%)  5. Brogdon  6. Van Vleet  7. Lamelo Ball  8. Sexton  9. Lonzo Ball  10. Russell  Splitting hairs on a few of these though
Where is Lamelo BALL????? Somebody pls
All the Ball brothers played pickup at our local 24 fitness in Chino Hills. Used to watch them play. Ironically LiAngelo looked like the most nba ready. Lamelo was a freshman in high school at the time.
"LaMelo Ball is bad, but I‚Äôm bias because I‚Äôm a huge Timberwolves fan, and was mad when Edwards lost to him for ROTY"
"PJ Washington/Draymond Green/Miles Bridges/Terry Rozier/LaMelo Ball would actually be a really cool small ball starting five. If Rozier or Ball learned to defend, the switchability of that unit would be interesting.   Sub Rozier for Oubre for defense and everyone in that lineup is 6'7 except for Bridges (6'6), and you'd have 3 guys with 7'2+ wingspans.   Now I want to see that, Philly should trade us Simmons"
"Nobody understands the importance of a good education better than LaMelo Ball. Wow, very impressed with him!"
"I feel pretty good about that. Terry took the leap once he was allowed to play more off ball and as a secondary ball handler. LaMelo is only going to get better at playmaking, so I think there's a fair chance Rozier continues to benefit. His catch and shoot 3 point shooting is elite, and he's in his prime."
2016: Pascal Siakam (wound up trading 22nd pick for Marco Belinelli- Siakam picked 27th)   2017: Donovan Mitchell (picked Monk at #11)     2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (actually picked him at #11 but swapped for Miles Bridges for a 2nd) / Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd (we got Devonte' and it was a great pick but Mitchell Robinson works better with the new team)       2019: PJ Washington at #12 (did well here) 2020: LaMelo Ball at #3 (no complaints in hindsight)  Would've been:  Ball/Mitchell/SGA/Siakam/Robinson with PJ Washington off the bench
"&gt;Yeah but do the 4 assists isn‚Äôt a big deal when you have LaMelo as the primary ball handler  Wasn't he the primary ball handler the previous year before Ball came?  His assists didn't change from the year prior.  He was a shoot-first PG who was moved off-ball last year because of Ball's arrival.  I think this role better suits his game, tbh."
GSW:  2015: Norman Powell  2016: Malcolm Brogdon  2018: Gary Trent jr  2019: Kelvin Johnson (need a forward)  2020: Lamelo Ball
"They provide education in the same way D1 Basketball and Football programs do. Miss me. I'm all for education. I'm in Data. A traditional schooling route gave me a phenomenal life in my mid twenties. I took AP classes, college courses in high school so please me.   However, if you're so talented at one thing that it can make you millions as a teenager, I do not give a fuck if you have traditional schooling. I don't care. I'd rather someone take the Lamelo Ball route than go to a D1 school to get a communications degree and not be able to do shit but coach or sales after football ends."
What bro did you even watch the hornets? Lamelo brought the ball up the court or take‚Ä¶ roziers greatest asset is his catch and shoot which is extremely valuable next to our primarily ball handler which again is Lamelo not rozier
Intelligence and knowing where states are not the same. Go ask a lot of doctors or surgeons anything not medicine related. You're dense.   No. Lamelo ball who's been a professional athlete since 16 doesn't need fucking school. Its why premier soccer prospect overseas are in soccer academys.
So you seriously think I can‚Äôt like LaMelo Ball acting like intelligence is unnecessary without being racist? You‚Äôre ridiculous and projecting
"well basically all of this (but the assisted part) is wrong.   Their TS%s last season are basically identical, and that's after Rozier's numbers cratered playing a role he will never play again when LaMelo and Hayward are healthy. His TS% was well into the low 60s for a significant portion of last season until he was forced to handle the ball due to our injuries.   Also Rozier is just a step above terrible defensively. He's better than Sexton, but far from a two-way player.  Rozier's value to the Hornets comes when there are multiple ball handlers on the floor, and he is asked to play off the ball. He is incredibly good in that role, and has been a legitimate top tier catch and shoot guy both seasons with us. He's much better equipped for that role than Sexton is, and it's the only real role that either of them would play on a good team."
"No. I'm acting like a 20 year old not knowing certain facts or not caring about traditional education isn't the end of the world considering he was playing professional basketball as a Teenager. Literally.   Lamelo is among the small group of people who did not need school. Basketball stars project to the NBA early. EARLY. You almost always see it coming unless it's an AD or Dwight Howard.   So no. Lamelo Ball. Who at 17 was playing basketball against grown men professionally did not need school. Again, you're wrong."
"Yeah but do the 4 assists isn‚Äôt a big deal when you have LaMelo as the primary ball handler and the 4 boards is just a bonus it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs Russ on the boards and he doesn‚Äôt need to be, yeah the defense isnt great but if we can actually get a decent rim protector in there it will help that a bit"
How is he a bad fit with Lamelo lol. He's an elite off ball catch and shoot guard.
Lamelo is our PG. Honestly what made Rozier go from frustrating to great with us was when we moved him to the 2 guard and let him play off ball with Graham his first year here. His catch and shoot is lethal.
They hated his last deal with us too. Idk people meme every move we make. Terry is frustrating sometimes but his off ball catch and shoot numbers are lethal. Great pairing with Lamelo.
Lamelo Ball hasn't spent a dime of his NBA money. What are you talking about? All of those rich white savants are notoriously one dimensional. And no one cares. You're full of it.

"you say 3rd best guard as if being just a bit worse than Terry Rozier and LaMelo Ball is a bad thing.   I would personally have traded Rozier before dumping either of Graham or Monk. I'm expecting a noticeable step back in Charlotte without those two, unless LaMelo blows up big time. Devonte' is a legitimate floor general that makes his teammates better, if you want to take a look at our on/off numbers."

"College isn‚Äôt for everyone, high school is. You play AAU, high school hoops and set up your G-League (or whatever they‚Äôre calling it this year) or foreign deal before you go.

Fuck dem kids   - LaMelo Ball
i think i would take lamelo first just bc his build and game seem to fit the future of basketball so well. tall primary ball handler with really good vision and shot creation   i really think he‚Äôll be a top 5 player someday
"Fuckin whole ball family gives basketball a bad name. I don‚Äôt care if they can hoop or not. Lonzo appears to be the brightest of the bunch and that is really not saying much. I understand what he is trying to say but god damnit man, words fucking matter. These idiots consistently say shit that makes you shake your head in disappointment. The whole family needs to recognize the reality and grow the fuck up. They clearly struggle with thinking outside themselves. Go back to fucking school during the off-season lamelo, you very clearly still have some learning to do."
"Man if you heard gilbert arenas talking about Lavar Ball. He had the perfect plan.  He says Lonzo should have signed with Nike, then use that money to build BBB. Then when Lamelo comes in you have something and Lamelo builds it from there.  He says thats the only thing Lavar messed up on."
"Looking like Lamelo Ball or Anthony Edwards at the moment but if I‚Äôm have to pick one then it‚Äôs Lamelo as he looks like he has the whole package: handle, passing, playmaking, size, improving shot. control of the offense."
"Lmao what a lazy ass excuse.   If Michael fucking Jordan can have enough drive to make it to the NBA and still get a college degree then so can LaMelo Ball. He just lazy and ""school too hard"" so not for everyone.  Maybe if you got your free education you could actually make something out of the Big Baller Brand and utilize all the tools that are available to you.  Not like the dude doesn't have a free time now either lmao."
LaMelo Ball
lamelo ball is literally a 19 year old kid lol. i have 5 years on the dude and I say shit I immediately regret about once an hour.
"LaMelo Ball is not, by any means, the first person to say school sucks. I literally used this exact reasoning to drop out of school chasing stand up. And I don't think I was 100% invested. I just didn't really want to work hard and only wanted to do things I loved, but I didn't work hard enough on my plan A. I've come a long way and still do it. But I also went back to school."
Lamelo Ball
Wait. Are you saying LaMelo Ball doesn‚Äôt lie? Or the ball doesn‚Äôt lie?
"Lonzo is probably the only brother capable of being a functioning member of society. He speaks coherently, understands nuance and seems to have a decent moral compass.  It's actually pretty crazy just how bad Liangelo and Lamelo are when comparing them to Lonzo. You should check out Ball in the Family. Lavar is surprisingly a good dad and husband. He raised Lonzo with the right priorities, but something definitely went wrong with the other 2."

If a Kid stop going to stop because of what LaMelo Ball of all people said they. They weren‚Äôt smart In the first place
LaMelo Ball
"Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I think college is important for most people, but I also acknowledge that it's not the right choice for everyone. But what irks me about people like LaMelo is that they aren't articulating that. They're just generalizing to ""school is useless."" That makes it sound like all school is useless, and for everyone. A large part of their fan base is in middle or high school, and telling those kids school doesn't matter is awful.  For most players that skip college and go to the NBA, it really is the most logical choice. It's better to play pro ball while they can, rather than putting it off a few years, during which they could decline in talent or face injury. But the difference I see between people like LeBron and people like LaMelo is that Lebron still seems to understand the value of education. I don't think Lebron is particularly smart or anything, but I believe he could go and get a degree after retiring if he wanted to. LeBron likely paid some attention during high school, so even though he skipped college, he still got a lot of basic learning in. LaMelo sounds like he wasted any and all educational opportunity (though to be fair, it sounds like his father is heavily at fault here, too), and I don't know if he's actually capable of getting accepted to college when there's no prospects of being on the basketball team anymore. I hope I'm wrong, though...maybe he's just trying to be cool or something and will change his attitude later."
"Again this isn't all about Lamelo, he still probably would have made the league doing the things you said. I do still believe though that the family he was born in, the age of youtube mixtapes and general high school basketball player celebrity did help him build off an already great foundation. When you're related to a pro athlete (Lonzo) you get so much more exposure, which leads to camp invites, personal training etc. Also being rich he doesn't have to get a job in high school, he can just focus on ball. Of course he still has to go out there and ball out, but he's always been invited to bigger stages than most kids will ever see making his pro path a little more clear and straightforward."
what kind of Clippers fan are you if you don't have Paul George in team good looks but have LaMelo ball in there instead. Lamelo ugly as a beat up steak
"Success can be measured in many ways, nowadays it's a rarity to be moderately successful without some sort of education. Save me the Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg dropped out from Harvard nonsense, that's another type of person that the average population is nothing like.  It's not about backing anything up, I wish success to everyone but if you're in a position of influence, you should consider the ramifications of your words. Consider who looks up to NBA players?  Lamelo ball is the exception. He's gifted at basketball in a way that very few are but his words can carry consequences to his audience."
"Who the fuck would have thought that among all the Ball brothers, the closest to LaVar in terms of personality is LaMelo"
At 19 I was a lot like him. Yeah. I was basically the LaMelo Ball of Dennys dishwashers.
"For me it‚Äôs more about the pervasive anti intellectualism that‚Äôs become rampant lately. It‚Äôs certainly not unique to the Ball family but there‚Äôs no reason to die on a hill for lack of education because someone waltzed into money. There‚Äôs nothing glamorous or admirable about openly deriding intelligence whether it‚Äôs LaMelo, Cousins or even Kyrie"
"I lived in the city where Lamelo played ball in Australia, met him few times and he speaks like someone who could have used those extra years of schooling hahaha"
Who's LaMelo ball?
LaMelo Ball Officially Signs With PUMA For Deal Reportedly Worth $100 Million  Making 8 mil a year as a rookie.  I suspect that most of the people calling him a dumb ass won't sniff his annual salary in their lifetime and their shoe deal is a coupon for 10% off at footlocker.  Anyway...just sayin..
Translated for the white people on this sub  &gt;So please don‚Äôt tell your mother ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to attend school‚Äù because LaMelo Ball said ‚Äúit is not necessary‚Äù  when you do not already possess a highly marketable skill in a specialized field and you are not 100% dedicated to this skill. Which in my case was playing basketball in the NBA
"LaMelo ""Roger Waters"" Ball."
The Ball family is a big name.  The middle brother was the most popular player in summer league and he isn't even on a official NBA roster yet.  LaMelo a household name already. He would get viewership easily no matter what market he is in.
Like lamelo ball.
"School's first mission is to teach you how to learn, which includes basic math, science and language skills, the tools required for learning other things. Then it's to introduce you to the concept of society. Specialized education should be a distant third.  LaMelo Ball obviously went to school for years and years, it was simply a highly specialized school on how to be a great basketball player. Whether he has any sort of grasp at all on anything else we don't really know."
‚ÄúWhat the fuck is school?‚Äù - Nelson Mandela - Michael Scott - Lamelo Ball.

"When your name is LaMelo Ball, the only thing you can do is ball. His name is a combination of LaMarcus Aldridge and Carmelo Anthony, and his last name is ball."

"You‚Äôve made your point. I think you‚Äôre extremely closed minded. America certainly does have a problem with anti-intellectualism, but school, especially higher education, is mostly a money-making scheme promoting inequality.

Of course. Its why we do it. We're just regular folk.  Lamelo Ball is not and has worked most of his life in the lab to get HIS 'decent job'.  Slam him for mocking the need of an education but DO NOT slam him for his use of AAVE.
"They've been one of the smarter organizations in the league for about four years now, it's hard to name all the good moves.  They flipped Shai for Miles Bridges and a couple picks.  They got Gordon Hayward on a bargain contract, then flipped Kemba for draft picks and Terry Rozier (who's averaging 20ppg on high efficiency).   Even this year Bouknight and Jones both looked good in summer league and seem perfect for the run-and-gun style they like with Hayward and Lamelo as ball handlers, and I really like the Kelly Oubre signing for them too."
"In these scenarios you describe, are we all Lamelo Ball?"
We not dumb to need school.  -lamelo ball 2021 (Rookie of the year).
"I think taken in context, someone like LaMelo has very little to gain from sitting in a classroom when all he wants to do with his life is play ball.   For the vast majority of the rest of us, sure this probably seems ludicrous to say lol"

"&gt; charlotte, sacramento  Why would you move LaMelo and Fox off ball lol"
LaMelo Ball
Michael Porter Jr I think could become a top 5 or top 10 player in the league in the next few years myself  LaMelo Ball most definitely for LaMelo
"Thats because that's exactly why they did much better this year, not Lamelo. They were still winning most of their games after he got injured, the roster is pretty good. He also sat out in crunch time most of their games when he was healthy since he wasn't helping them close games. The media will make people believe lamelo carried tho cause putting ""Ball"" in your video title instead of Rozier/Hayward/PJ Washington gets you clicks"
"LaMelo Ball is one. And Lonzo as well, though for many I think that ship has sailed."
"Easy. LaMelo ball. Over hyped because BALL. Good playmaker , w inconsistent jumper. Hes a Ricky Rubio not magic or Isaiah. Solid not super star"
"LaMelo Ball has opted to request a trade from the Charlotte Hornets after being disappointed in their fake praise of his brother, LiAngelo. Ball was quoted as saying, ""Don't blow fake smoke up his ass. Man been trash for the most and you just saying he good to make me happy""."
Jaren Jackson Jr.Memphis Grizzlies.   LaMelo Ball. Charlotte Hornets.
LaMelo Ball
LaMelo Ball?
"Miles ‚ÄúBRIDGESSSSS‚Äù Bridges. I‚Äôve thought he was gonna be amazing since Mich St days and now that he has a point guard like lamelo it seems he‚Äôs on the right path to dominating. When lamelo was out he showed he can play point forward a tiny bit improved ball handling and shooting off the dribble obviously an explosive athlete also, and I expect him to be even better this year too. Want this dude to succeed"
Miles Bridges. His improvement year on year has been stunning. guy was just an athlete in year 1 who was a mediocre dribbler. Now he is a hyperathletic playmaking small ball 4. He reminds me of Blake Griffin and would not shock me if he a blow up this season with a more developed Lamelo getting him easier looks
"Kuminga, hachimura, Jonathan issac, lamelo ball. Lamelo and kuminga all nba potential. Issac dpoy and all star potential, he gotta get out of Orlando ASAP tho. Hachimura perennial 20, 8, and 4 all star if his team is competing. I like his feel for the game. He is to me what Kyle kuzma thinks he is."
"Yeah I think their pops killed the kids brand, I personally assumed that they'd come in and be ball hogs with the hype the dad was selling. They're the exact opposite though, they're both pass first points and LaMelo has some solid scoring ability. I think for the old heads, their pops killed their name for them. I'm not sure how the younger generation felt about them, Lonzo certainly gets a lot of hate on here even though he's got a solid game and has improved every year. Certainly hasn't lived up to the number two pick though."
No particular order   1. Luka Doncic  2. Zion Williamson  3. Brandon Ingram   4. Devin Booker  5. Jayson Tatum  6. LaMelo Ball  7. DeArron Fox  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   9. Jaylen Brown   10. Dejounte Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. Michael Porter  13. Deandre Ayton  14. Jamal Murray  15. Donavan Mitchell  16. Jarret Allen  17. Collin Sexton  18. Trae Young  19. Bam Adebayo  20. Ben Simmons  21. Anthony Edwards  22. John Collins  23. Myles Turner  24. Marvin Bagley   25. Lonzo Ball
All 3 ball brothers have such one of a kind play styles. Gelo is the most prototypical if I had to pick out of the 3 but even there he has some weird qualities like being built like a linebacker but also has great shooting and was a great rebounder at lower levels don't know how good he'll be on the glass as a whole.  Then you have LaMelo who's a beanpole at 6'7 183 pounds but can someone finish through contact at the rim against grown men.
PG is so stacked it's great. Here's all 30.   LAL - Westbrook   GSW - Curry   Kings - Fox   Suns - CP3   Houston - John Wall  Mavericks - Luka   Pelicans - Graham   Spurs - DeJounte Murray   Grizzlies - Morant   Portland - Dame   OKC - Shai   Nuggets - Murray   Jazz - Conley  Wolves - D‚ÄôAngelo Russell  6ers - Simmons  Nets - Irving   Knicks - Rose   Celtics - Smart   Raptors - VanFleet  Bucks - Jrue   Pacers - Brogdon   Bulls - Ball   Cavs - Sexton   Pistons - Cade   Hawks - Trae   Heat - Lowry   Wizards - Dinwiddie   Hornets - LaMelo Ball   Magic - Fultz
The Ball family was saving the best one for last  They had to wait until LaMelo got to the NBA before unleashing him
"By far the best of the Ball family, lamelo way better then lonzo"
"Rozier for sure  He‚Äôs overshadowed by Lamelo Ball but he‚Äôs one of the best off the catch 3 point shooters, if not the best (I believe over 50%) and also a great pnr and off the dribble scorer. He could be useful on any team."
"Eh I don't think that the last part of your post is necessarily true  Lonzo/Lamelo haven't really been involved in that much drama themselves, it's just the Ball name"

He‚Äôs a ball brother lol if he was having a bad summer league he would still make the roster bc Lamelo is good enough to dictate if he wants gelo on his team
I think OP meant bc he‚Äôs on the Hornets with LaMelo so sort of because he‚Äôs a Ball brother

LaMelo Ball an All Star.
If you in the league you long.  These ball bros have IQ off the charts and that is the factor.  I really think Lamelo will be a big deal.  Lonzo has the right attitude to support a championship team.    I'm just so glad it turned out well because I was worried their dad was gonna F them up.  And a couple times almost did lol
"The only group of fans that truly get under my skin only do it when they talk about some players:  - Lakers: Really not that bad tbh, but will you please give the ‚ÄúTHT future star‚Äù bullshit a rest. Like honestly, shut up.  - Twolves: guaranteed 5+ downvotes for merely saying ‚ÄúLaMelo Ball is a great rookie‚Äù during last season. He won ROTY. Get over it.  - Knicks (i know, i know): general delusion"
1. Donovan Mitchell (1.3) - #27 in turnovers (2.8)  2. Jrue Holiday (1.3) ‚Äî #50 in turnovers (2.2)  3. Khyri Thomas (1.2) ‚Äî ? in turnovers (1.2) ‚Äî only played 5 games  4.

Lamelo with the biggest loose Ball recovered of the season with recruiting Liangelo
"It‚Äôs all the making of an SB nation collapse, it all starts in 2019. Then 2020 injuries, not drafting LaMelo Ball is looking like a horrific mistake. Trading DLo for Wiggins is really biting them now even if Wiggins is a better fit. What more could go wrong for this Warrior‚Äôs franchise which will waste the rest of Steph‚Äôs good years?"
Ok but why? What about him seems that young? If anything I have a harder time taking LaMelo Ball seriously than Tatum
"Well obviously‚Ä¶but even jokingly it doesn‚Äôt make sense to say someone older is someone‚Äôs younger brother, you should have gone with like Tyler Herro and LaMelo Ball or something like that"
"ok, LaMelo needs to become a better shooter, shot creator, driver, finisher, ball handler, passer, defender, rebounder, and get much much stronger... then we can talk about Luka."
"The popular answer will be LaMelo Ball. Obviously, he's got to follow up his ROY season with another stellar one.   But honestly, I think the two real x-factors for the Hornets will be PJ Washington and Kelly Oubre. PJ because he's been fairly inconsistent so far, but has shown many flashes of being an incredibly versatile PF for us on both ends of the floor. Oubre because he can have a legit chance to be 6th Man of the Year if he's up for the challenge."
"For Lamelo, I think the risk is worth it. His family is already making millions off his father's business alone. Then there's Lonzo bringing in some good NBA money. They are already so deep into investment and portfolio diversification that the usual fear of financially illiterate layers blowing through their life's salary in 3 years doesn't apply to the Ball family either."
Bovado's Betting Odds for the 2022 Assists/Game Leader:  1. Harden: -110  2. Westbrook: +200 3. Trae: +400 4. Luka: +600 5. CP3: +1200  6. Jokic: +1500 7. LeBron &amp; LaMelo:+2500  I'm assuming based on these odds that Westbrook will probably have the ball in his hands more often than LeBron.
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Alex Caruso  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Joel Embiid  Bench  LaMelo Ball / Jamal Murray / Austin Rivers / Lu Dort / Jae Crowder / Robert Covington / Clint Capela  I legitimately think this team can go 82-0 if injuries are not a factor.
Anthony Edwards and LaMelo Ball are going to accept the QO lol
"Not good enough all around. Hope he finds a way on defense to rack up on ball steals cuz that could be what propels him but I had said in another reply further up that LaMelo Ball is going to eclipse Trae fast. Same range, same playmaking ability, but LaMelo is a serviceable defender with 8 more inches of height that helps him finish amongst the trees. They did a great job hiding Trae on defense with Capela and good wing defenders, maybe as long as the Hawks org keeps that up he has a shot."
I really fuck with Trae but I think in the future LaMelo Ball will outshine him by a mile. Does everything Trae does but has good defense and an extra 8 inches of height to back up his passing vision and finishing ability.
"Unicorn has never made sense to me. The defining feature of unicorns is not that there's just one of them lol. So now when I hear it I hear ""LaMelo Ball is too pure for this world."""
LaMelo Ball
"Joining the league in 1990 the Minnesota Timberwolves drafted all time great Kevin Garnett in 1996 and proceeded to have this legend of the sport for his best years until 2007 at which they were able to draft Kevin Love in the 2008 NBA draft who proceeded to give his best All NBA years to the Timberwolves up until 2014 at which point they traded him for the #1 pick in the 2014 draft, Andrew Wiggins as well as selecting future All Star Zach LaVine in the same draft. In the next year Minnesota would proceed to solidify their young core taking the greatest shooting big man of all time Karl Anthony Towns at #1 in the 2015 draft to add to their young core. To provide leadership to this team Minnesota brought on former coach of the year Tom Thibodeau and then traded Zach LaVine for perennial 2 way All Star Jimmy Butler. As the Butler situation soured in early 2019 Minnesota still had their young superstar center and had traded Andrew Wiggins for the young Brooklyn All Star DAngelo Russell. Immediately that 2020 draft Minnesota had the option to draft LaMelo Ball but opted for the young stud Anthony Edwards to create a new star studded young core.   Minnesota Timberwolves all time record: .394 win rate and 9 playoff appearances in 31 seasons."
LaMelo Ball for Prime Alonzo Mourning is intriguing‚Ä¶
LaMelo Ball for Kemba Walker lol
Trade Lamelo Ball for KOBE FUCKING BRYANT
"Yeah I'd trade Hayward or Rozier for age 25-29 Kemba Walker. Super easy decision imo. I really like the idea of Ball and Kemba sharing ball-handling and scoring duties, and having Ball guarding wings rather than guards.  Now if you mean the player we're building the team around... I'm sticking with LaMelo, knowing Kemba's significant knee issues started at 29. The ceiling could be a good bit higher than Kemba, and we have 8 years of contractual control, rather than just 4 years of Kemba's prime before the knee troubles happen."
Wasn‚Äôt there a situation like this where lamelo ball gave his teammate the ball at the last second so he wouldn‚Äôt get the turnover?
"I'd venture to say that a guy like Kuzma in LA has similar commercial pull to a star in Charlotte. Think of the national attention he got all last year vs Hayward or Rozier. LaMelo got a lot of attention but that has more to do with him being a Ball and playing at a ROTY caliber. Even then, Lonzo got WAY more attention in his first year with the Lakers than LaMelo got with the Hornets, and LaMelo was miles ahead of where Lonzo was his rookie year."
LaMelo Ball
What the fuck is school? - Lamelo  Ball
LaMelo Ball.
LaMelo Ball talking about the severely older (for a teenager) cougar he‚Äôs dating
LaMELO BALL
I'm going to shock a lot of people...  LaMelo Ball.
"I'm a certified LaMelo Ball doubter so I'm not that convinced the Hornets will overperform without a steady, healthy, Hayward."
"I agree as well, BUT HOW DARE THIS MAN TALK ABOUT OUR BALL. YOU KNOW WHOS OVERRATED!!! LAMELO BALL. THATS LAMELO. PRONOUNCED LAME-LOL.      ....god I hope the bulls make playoffs...."
Lamelo Ball &gt; Westbrook
Im sure there will be some lamelo ball and face palm emoji outrage
"The NBA is stuck with their stars on bad teams. The play-in tourneyment, extra payoff teams, and these weird tlurneyments are just ways for them to TRY and get young stars like Zion and Lamelo ball"
"Honest question: Why WOULDN'T younger stars like LaMelo , Jalen Green, Anthony Edwards etc try to ball out in this tournament? Especially if it gives them more national TV airtime and helps build their brand??   I think people aren't seeing the vision of this... bc it can actually help young teams trying to build comradery , and also showcases up-and-coming stars in the league. Everything doesn't have to revolve around whether Lebron will participate or not.."
How good is LaMelo off ball (genuinely asking - I only watched like 2 CHA games)
"I'm in the process of watching all the Kings games from last season, and Kings fans on their sub gave me loads of detail about aspects of the team I found interesting and confusing (the link is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/pmve6u/ive_begun_watching_the_kings_202021_season_not/) and to emphasise the real value is in the responses).  Optimistic because Haliburton is so, so, undersold and it shouldn't be hard for the team to realise what they have in him. I think people don't notice him as much because the areas where he lacks a little (neither the flashiness of LaMelo or Anthony Edwards, no pull-up midrange or much self-creation) tend to be the areas that get highlights. This is a player who within maybe five, ten games was running a great offense when he had the chance. His passing is spectacular, his ability to guard his man is spectacular, he's 41% from 3 on 5+ attempts per game, he has amazing IQ, and he's come into the league already an established good all-around player. In the games he started the Kings had a .500 record, and I *think* most of the time he was starting was due to injuries to Fox/Hield, so that record was achieved even with a partial roster.  Buddy Hield is still a positive player, and his weaknesses will hopefully be covered a little better by a) eliminating entirely the few instances when he's asked to come up the court with the ball, and b) a smarter team defensive identity (he really is very, very bad on that end). But the defense *and* rebounding are the biggest issues. So much can unlock for the team if they can manage even a 20th ranked defense and/or 20th ranked ability to defensively rebound (instead of dead last in both categories). They run the fast break really well (mostly because Fox thrives with those chances), so anything that gives them more of those opportunities is going to impact the offense in a massive way.  I'm beginning to think Walton isn't actually as bad as people say, but that's different from being good. The roster isn't well constructed so it's a difficult challenge for any coach, *but* the improvements needed are smaller than the benefits they'd bring so I'm still optimistic."
"Because he‚Äôs a Ball brother.  They‚Äôre like the basketball Kardashians, absolutely everybody who watches NBA has known about the Balls since at least the year Lonzo was at UCLA.  They‚Äôve had ESPN videos made about them as far back as 4-5 years ago, and LaMelo became national news as a freshman because he dropped 92 in a game and their team basically annihilated everyone else on the way to a state title.  Lonzo wasn‚Äôt a top player, but he was extremely high profile since forever.  LaMelo was able to take that and the added hype of all of his brothers saying he was the best and back it up with his skills.  Say what you want about Lavar but mans is a marketing genius."
"Look all Imma say about this, is that New Orleans was probably the worst place Zion could go. Smallest market in the league and front office that doesnt seem very competent. The only saving grace is he gets to play with Brandon Ingram. Everyone is aware just how much the hype of his college season has died down despite him proving that the hype was warranted. I think instagram followers is a pretty good way to measure how popular a player is and Zion's has been trending downwards instead up, despite his fantastic season. Just look at his social blade. https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/zionwilliamson/monthly This is in stark difference to his contemporaries like ja morant, lamelo ball Nd Luka doncic whose social media are still climbing at a consistent pace. Although Zion is also not the best at marketing himself. Players care about this stuff more than you would think. If the Pelicans don't show they can build a consistent playoff team around him, I think it's entirely possible that he might want out earlier than expected."
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I‚Äôd rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
This is an interesting question. All these players have similar minutes played and games played last season (with Shai playing 35 games as an exception).I took a numeric approach to ranking these players. Opting to assign points to the 5 major counting stats in a fantasy points based system.  &amp;nbsp;    |Pts|Reb|Ast|Stl |Blk| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |1|1.2|1.2|3|3|  &amp;nbsp;           ---  &amp;nbsp;          |**Ja Morant**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|19.1|4|7.4|0.9|0.2||| |**Final**|19.1|4.8|8.88|2.7|0.6|36.08|5|  &amp;nbsp;    |**De'Aaron Fox**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|25.2|3.5|7.2|1.5|0.5||| |**Value**|25.2|4.2|8.64|4.5|1.5|44.04|2|  &amp;nbsp;    |**Trae Young**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|25.3|3.9|9.4|0.8|0.2||| |**Value**|25.3|4.68|11.28|2.4|0.6|44.26|1|  &amp;nbsp;    |**Michael Porter Jr.**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|19|7.3|1.1|0.7|0.9||| |**Value**|19|8.76|1.32|2.1|2.7|33.88|6|  &amp;nbsp;    |**Shai Gilgeous-Alexander**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|23.7|4.7|5.9|0.8|0.7||| |**Value**|23.7|5.64|7.08|2.4|2.1|40.92|3|  &amp;nbsp;    |**Lamelo Ball**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|15.7|5.9|6.1|1.6|0.4||| |**Value**|15.7|7.08|7.32|4.8|1.2|36.1|4|  &amp;nbsp;
"Ranking for right now, not for potential:  1. Trae. Great playmaker, proven playoff performer, good shooter but also good at getting to the line and has a nice floater/drive. Not a good defender, but no longer the worst in the league.  2. SGA: put up efficient scoring and playmaking numbers last year despite having Dort/Horford as his only NBA-level teammates. He‚Äôs a really promising combo guard, legit playmaker and great scorer.  3. Fox: had a great year last year in a Kings team that doesn‚Äôt have much coaching. He‚Äôs not the playmaker that Trae is (IMO) and not as well-rounded as SGA, so he falls a bit.  4. Jamal: efficient combo guard who can consistently average 20 and has the ability to go off for 50. Can play well offball, good in the PNR, solid playmaker. Not a bad player at all but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs the type of lead guy the first three are, assuming Bubble Murray is a fluke.  5. Ja: his shot isn‚Äôt great, nor is his defense, but he‚Äôs incredibly bouncy, a good playmaker, and he has that ‚Äúit‚Äù factor. Again, this is just ranking for now, going off potential Ja would be much higher. He has a great mentality and is a team leader, on top of his basketball ability.  6. MPJ: not a guard so not sure why he‚Äôs here. Absolutely offensive flamethrower, especially from three, but his defense sucks and he‚Äôs a non-passer; if the ball ends up in his hands, it‚Äôs ending the play in his hands, be it a make or miss. I think the other players are more well-rounded than he is, but, again, potential is sky-high.  7. LaMelo: promising because he has that ability to make every pass, but below these guys because he‚Äôs still a rookie and adjusting. Love the guy but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to have him in conversation with multiple All-Stars and several guys who‚Äôve shown up in the playoffs."
"Magic Johnson got nicknamed ""Tragic"" after a bad playoff run in the early 80's.  Markelle Fultz got nicknamed ""MH370"" because his game disappeared and no one knew why.  The Brooklyn Nets called the Brooklyn Nuts after we got Kyrie.  Kristaps Porzingis, ""The Trebuchet"" because he's 100-feet tall and launches slow shots from a mile away.  Zion Williamson ""Snorlax.""  Kawhi Leonard was ""Wi-Fi"" because he was amazing but he would cut out on you whenever he felt like it.  Someone called Lamelo Ball ""LMAO Ball"" when he looked like he might bust but Lamelo escaped that fate.  The Lakers were the Los Angeles Flakers after the 2004 loss.  Andrew Wiggins was ""Adrian"" because despite being 6'8"" with a 44"" vertical his most famous Youtube clip was a prankster asking him if he was Asian and he thought the guy said Adrian."

"The Ball brothers really changed perceptions for lost people. Everyone assumed they were these bonafide superstars with ego problems mainly due to Lavar. But man, Lonzo seems really down-to-earth and mellow and willing to improve. It doesn‚Äôt feel like he has that big an ego, and it‚Äôs almost like he knows he‚Äôs not going to be a No.1, and he‚Äôs fine with that.   There were all these criticisms of Lamell for the same stuff, but last year he just looked like a good teammate. LaMelo took his defense from a 2/10 to like a 6/10 in a season with no off-season training and limited practices. There‚Äôs work ethic in the Ball Brothers, and idk if I can say that for Simmons."
"He also predicted the careers of Lonzo and LaMelo Ball: ‚ÄúCause the same people that tried to black ball me/Forgot about **two things, my black balls**‚Äù"
"LaMelo Ball.   I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs bad, obviously he‚Äôs young and has lots to grow, but if you go by internet comments people would rank him a top 10 pg in the league already which‚Ä¶ he is not."
"Lamelo ball, brad Beal, lonzo ball, Chris broucher, Marvin bagley  Deadly small ball lineup if healthy"
Or hayward's 3 ball as well. Lamelo with a more consistent jumpshot/creation is a monster
LaMelo with Rozier's 3-ball would be nuts
I think you meant [Lamelo](https://streamable.com/ckhikm) Ball.
They‚Äôre about to enter their second year.  Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs a little early to compare Lamelo Ball to Steph Curry and James Wiseman to Ricky Rubio/Jonny Flynn?
"Who said hype? I'm talking about popularity.  Do you know how many more NBA fans there are in the world today than there were in 2003? Hundreds of millions of them.  If you wanna base the discussion on which players had more eyeballs on them in high school, it's not insane to say LaMelo Ball and you know I am right."
"No, there absolutely is not.  In terms of hype in regards to actual basketball, the Ball bros came nowhere close to the hype of Lebron.  No one was hyping them as the next GOAT.  If social media was a thing in 2002, Lebron's IG followers would be just as crazy, that's an absolutely absurd argument to make.  Lebron's hype vastly exceeded that of Lonzo and Lamelo.  Like it's not even a discussion, dude."
lol LaMelo ball was born before Carmelo made it to the league... sheer coincidence
"Can I go backwards? I kept out of the whole Ball brother BS, so when Lamelo came in and was putting up great numbers I thought he was great.  Then I saw a few interviews with him recently and I just think he‚Äôs so obnoxious."
"Tall pointguard.  Imo, the difference is based a lot on how much the ball handler has to turn his back to a defender.  For example,  I don't think Cade Cunningham will be able to bring the rock up and initiate the offense against good defenders without turning his back and limiting his vision forward. Doesn't impair his vision if he gets it in the mid or low post.  Lamelo on the other hand is better able to remain faced up and burn you for reaching.  With all due respect to his game, thered be no question about Luka being a tall pg if he were in great shape."
"The media just voted Jokic as the MVP, nearly unanimously. He‚Äôs not overly media hated, you‚Äôre Spot on with Russ though.  For too much love I think CP3 has more than earned it he‚Äôs been one of the best guards in the game for the better part of 2 decades  For Donavan I think he‚Äôs a very good player on an upward trajectory who does nothin but win games so far. I don‚Äôt think many in the media are saying he‚Äôs already earned all time great status or something.  Lamelo def gets too much love just because he‚Äôs incredibly well known and marketable. Kid is still pretty good at ball though  AD gets way too much love I agree there. People are trying to say he‚Äôs coming after Duncan as the best PF ever. Like cmon now. Easily Dirk, Kg, Barkley, Giannis, Pedo Malone and imo rodman are better than AD."
Melo is rookie of the year LaMelo Ball; this is Ant.
"&gt;Whoever puts up the best numbers wins the trophy  That didn‚Äôt happen last year, where Lamelo won it over Edwards. It‚Äôll go to whoever has more team success. ROTY tends to favor all-around stats vs just scoring.  Cade also has a good supporting cast. Jerami is a 20 ppg scorer, Saddiq shoots the lights out, Kelly O is a good shooter, Frank J is very good off the bench, Diallo a lob threat and Stew is great down low. He should be getting assists as long as the ball is in his hands."
We all know it the youngest is LaMelo ball who played for the legendary LA ballers should be the youngest
"His stats are far above average. 14.6/4.8/5.7 with 1.5 steals is very respectable and the list of players who average his statline or better is:  1.	Jimmy Butler 2.	LaMelo Ball  And that's the whole list. Obviously it's very selective to include all of those stats, but it helps to illustrate that Lonzo provides good stuff all around - solid rebounder, good passer, good defender (steals don't precisely correlate to defense bit they are still valuable), and can hit threes. It's not a super common skillset."
Lamelo Ball
"We had already started to lose once he was out lol. Him and Hayward both got hurt at the same time, he came back early from his predicted to be season ending wrist injury and his shot was broken and he did not single handedly stop our slide.  But if you're trying to imply we were better without Lamelo with that contextless cherry picked stat then I don't know what to tell you üòÇ.  Lamelo Ball went 14-17 in games he started. The Hornets went 33-39 for the season that's not better üòÇ. Using wins and losses from when he was coming off the bench for Devnote Graham is pretty stupid."
Lamelo Ball
Lamelo Ball. Way too many people acting like he is the next Dame/ Steph. And goddamn 2K putting him 1 point below RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS A FUCKING TRAVESTY.

Lamelo ball
"LaMelo Ball.. first that comes to mind.. I wanna see what he‚Äôll do in year 2. Michael Carter-William‚Äôs put up 16, 6, 6 and fell off after.. just sayin."
"How is a guy who has played pro ball and has savant-like basketball IQ a project? Yeah, the shot was expected to be terrible and you had some decision making, defense issues, but Wiseman had most of the same problems, along with a bunch of other shit.  Also, Warriors needing an actual big means that they don't value Draymond at the 5. Warriors desperately needed playmaking. LaMelo provides that."
Wiseman also went ahead of Lamelo ball  Draft analysts have said top 3 of this years draft would go number on in last years draft
Edwards went 1st overall in a draft with Lamelo Ball
"Have you heard of the name, Lamelo Ball? Or Ja Morant? If Ja won 5 rings, people would make the same arguments that they do for Kobe. If you have a big personality it doesn't matter where you are. Look at AI  No one's making the GOAT argument for Kobe, cause even Kobe stans know he's 98% Michael jordan, but still not MJ.   Kobe vs Bron comparisons have been a thing since Bron was drafted, cause until 2009 or so it was Kobe's league, then it started to shift towards Bron."

"Someone on the magic, spurs, Houston, or lamelo ball"
"LaMelo gets more coverage than Zion because the Ball brothers are insanely popular, especially with younger fans.  The reason why Zion doesn't have the same hype anymore is because he went to NOLA and not New York."
"Lamelo Ball, Joel Embiid, and Donovan Mitchell. Also like watching Zion play, but idk that I‚Äôd call him one of my favs"
"It is imperative that Lonzo, Lamelo, and LiAngelo all name their first children Cockin. Cockin Ball."
LeBron tried to be LeMelo but it came out LameLo because he ain't a Ball.
I think Lamelo Ball will make a first time all star appearance next year.   I think Mike Conley won't make it next year.
Antitty‚Ä¶bwahahaha!!!!      Those three are Giannis and his two brothers that play garbage minutes. They do not have the same play style.       I‚Äôve not seen the youngest Ball brother play that much. But LaMelo is definitely a better version of Lonzo (so far).
"Lamelo ball, Lonzo ball, liangelo ball"
Liangelo Ball Lonzo Ball LaMelo Ball
Stephen A.: THE HORNETS WERE ATROCIOUS LAST NIGHT  Magic: They lost 121 - 108  Stephen A.: LAMELO BALL NEEDS TO STEP UP HIS GAME IF HE WANTS TO BE AN ALL-STAR  Magic: LaMelo Ball plays for the Hornets!
"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"
Lamelo ball far too high
Lamelo ball August 22
"random. zeke, d'angelo, westbrook, paul george, ,reggie jackson/lamelo ball"
"Toronto is in a transitionary period, but the question is whether they got more worse than the Hornets got better?  The Raptors guard rotation is weaker than the Hornets', though I think you are overestimating Ball slightly and underestimating VanVleet slightly.  I think its hard to argue that the Hornets frontcourt is better, Siakam and OG are more versatile options than Washington/Hayward; and I have no confidence that Hayward will stay healthy long enough to revert back to old Hayward and make it a contest between him and Pascal.  Centre is basically a wash between each team.  Last year the Hornets won 6 more games than the Raptors.   The respective factors in their issues were Lamelo's Injury and Hayward's for the Hornets.  COVID absences, Pascal/Kyle injuries and playing ~70 away games for the Raptors.  We lose Kyle over the offseason, gain Scottie Barnes, Dragic and Precious Achiuwa, likely a net negative in win shares.  Hornets get Oubre, Plumlee, Bouknight and Kai Jones, I would score that as neutral, maybe +2 win shares.  My confidence comes from believing that a healthy Raptors team that gets to play out of Toronto increases wins by 8-10. Whether that is enough remains to be seen, any gap in projected wins is made up by homerism.  My greater point is that you refer to teams getting significantly better in the last 2 years, for the Hornets their improvement is Lamelo Ball, Hayward and improvement from Rozier. In the last 4 years they finish 10th, 9th, 10th and 10th in the East. Their success this year depends on Lamelo growth, Rozier maintenance/growth and Hayward health, none of their acquisitions are big needle movers.  I don't think they belong in the conversation about why the Raptors no longer figure into the Playoff picture. And as for the Raptors not being contenders, that's pretty clear, but not because the Hornets are a juggernaut.  My confidence in 100 out of 100 matchups is just me saying if I was putting money on the head to head matchup, I'm taking the Raps."
does Lamelo ball have rotating birthday?
"There's also another factor.  The NBL is financially unstable, and has decided to go all-in on being a development league for the NBA, because this improves crowds, gets more media attention and gets a pipeline of good players coming in. And occasionally you get LaMelo Ball offering to personally make sure the Illawarra Hawks make payroll this month after the team owner had issues.  Therefore, while Euroleague is a higher quality league, Euroleague coaches want to win today, because if they pour minutes into kids that leave for the NBA then their team doesnt benefit, and you might get relegated while you do.  But a kid like Nikita Mikhailovski (six-eight Russian kid, made the all-star team in the Russian league because he passes and shoots good and - stop me if you've heard this before - apparently doesn't have elite athleticism, shot creation or ball handling) *is* going to get minutes playing for Tasmania in the NBL.  And if he does good in the NBL, then NBA managers are going to go 'Could be a Mamu or a Poku' and he gets a shot at the big time."
"Because the nba back then wasn't as skilled. Just get a big guy and he just drop steps the other team till they lose. Why would u want george mikan setting people up for you lol.   There wasn't any goal tend rules, hand check was there, back to the basket wasn't a rule either. So get a  small guy in comparison to nba height  that's crafty to get the ball to the big guy.   But points guards are getting bigger now. Ben, lamelo, luka, cade, all are 6'6 and up."
"It's funny that people thought Lavar was fucking up LaMelo's career by pulling him from HS and having him not play college (he eventually did do that 1 year at Spire though). Clearly it worked out. If you believe your son is that supremely talented, it's better for his development to play pro-ball than play college imo, plus HS isn't doing anything for someone who's going to the NBA. Plus LaMelo was getting PAID from endorsements already and going to NCAA would ruin that."
"Really enjoying the energy Hornets team plays with. Off-game for LaMelo, but Bridges has been on fire, MIP! Too many turnovers, but they managed to pull it off.   I wish their games were easier to watch in CA. Can‚Äôt they make a hometown exception to watch the Ball boys?"
"Against the celtics with 1:10 to go in overtime and down 7 with the ball, LaMelo committed an offensive foul, his 6th. He took a foul in the middle of the game on a nothing fast break that wasn't even a guaranteed bucket. I don't mind the foul in fast break being a thing because I feel some guys who play big minutes actually hurt their team by taking them. Even Bridges took an intentional to stop a fast break and ended up with 5PF. Yeah it sucks when just some guy playing 15min is taking them, but I feel there's viable strategy either way the rule goes."
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
What if you had the athleticism of Anthony Edwards with the passing of LaMelo Ball.   You'd have Ja Morant.
Hornets. Two reasons:  1) Micheal Jordan  2) LaMelo Ball   3) I lied when I said two reasons. I also love their announcers

lamelo ball has a better chance at ever winning a title than Luka

lAmElO pLaYs HeRo BaLl   This sub knows basketball I'll say that
"I would disagree that these are cherry picked when they‚Äôre just the base NBA passing stats. The original comment‚Äôs point was that Ant never passes, idk how else that notion could be disputed  without examining passing statistics.     I would say it could definitely potentially be misleading, though.     I didn‚Äôt name those other players to imply that Ant is a better passer than them. That would be ludicrous. Obviously he‚Äôs not a better passer than literally any of those guys. And on top of that, it‚Äôs a tiny sample, given it‚Äôs been 3 games. But with these obscure stats like passes per game or potential assists per game, you need a reference point, right? If you told me Ant passed the ball 40 times per game, in a vacuum, I would honestly have no idea what that means. Is that a lot? Is that a little? How does it compare to the rest of the league?      LaMelo, Fox, Giannis, Randle, KD. Those are all great players who do a great job passing and getting their teammates involved. 40 passes a game means a lot more when you are able to use other players as a reference point. I used them to add context, not to cherry pick stats to imply he‚Äôs a better passer than any of them."
"The Ball Bros are legitimately celebrities at this point. Zo was doin cameos on TV shows his rookie year like he was Kobe or sum shit üò≠. LaMelo has had more followers than some NBA stars and most NBA players since he was 16. And they were both just recently in a couple movie commercials, one for Marvel. Lavar made a lot of people dislike them but he also made a lot more people know them. Shit Lavar himself was famous enough to get impersonated on SNL. Plus the WWE shit which was fun too."

"Exactly after Lithuania he came out playing more like Lonzo except he‚Äôs a killer as a scorer. If you look past the ridiculousness of Lavar‚Äôs JBA, what LaMelo was showing was legit. People just didn‚Äôt want to look past the shit that came with Lavar.   But he was a 6‚Äô6 PG with elite playmaking and scoring. He was a triple double threat in the JBA. Ik the comp wasn‚Äôt the best but he carried that play style over when he went to Spire and he played real comp. Averaged a triple double there. I always see people say the NBL changed him so much (I‚Äôm sure it did) but I felt he was always a great prospect even before he went. Especially once he grew to 6‚Äô6. Scouts just didn‚Äôt want to take him seriously because he was a Ball."

"Not on the level of Lonzo or Lamelo, but still a very solid ball player who could provide a spark off the bench for an NBA team."
My former Laker tracker:  * Clarkson: accurately rated - 6th man * D‚ÄôLo: accurately rated - but I still believe he won‚Äôt win unless he‚Äôs in the 6th man Role.  * Randle: underrated - never thought he‚Äôd be consistently good. Only in spurts. * Nance - overrated - his denfense isn‚Äôt all that * Hart - accurately rated - situational role player  * Ingram - ??? - I still think he‚Äôs a star but I just don‚Äôt know about ceiling or timeline * Ball - overrated - I thought he‚Äôd be Lamelo with defense and consistent Bron level passing * Caruso - accurately rated - GOAT * Kuz - overrated- thought he‚Äôd be scoring 24+ a night on a bad team. I seriously don‚Äôt understand is offensive drop off and inconsistency. His defensive improvements are nice but I‚Äôll let the nerds tell me if his rebounding is anything to get excited about.
"I was so pissed when I was unable to get Dame in my fantasy team, had to settle with LaMelo Ball"
Lamelo Ball
"Great awareness by Smart to make that reach to get the ball, but Lamelo needs to seal there better, and the pass needs to happen earlier when Ball is moving toward an open space if that is the play."
Favorite players all time for me are Rudy Gay and DRose. Outside of them Id probably say Iso Joe Johnson and LaMelo Ball.
"It's really funny to see when people have, like... No idea how basketball development works.  LaMelo right now is not as good as Jordan Poole right now, especially *for the Warriors*, since Jordan Poole knows the Warriors system and how to play off ball. A ball dominant point guard who's a mediocre shooter simply does not fit.  I think comparisons between different positions are generally stupid, but since I have in fact previously witnessed the development of young bigs, I think that barring injury is very likely Wiseman becomes a more valuable player than LaMelo ball.  His BBIQ is fine. His skills were undeveloped, which was wholly expected in a teenage who'd played the games since high school and been unable even to go through training camp. He improved rapidly through the games he got to play and seemed sorry coachable, since he tends not to repeat mistakes even after just being talked through then in-game.  People badly overrate how much worse the Warriors were with him on the floor, presumably because they just look at box scores and don't *watch the goddamn games*. When he was playing, the entire team was concentrating on Wiseman In-Season Training Camp instead of just playing to win.  Because last season was just a year-long training camp anyway. Getting the young guys reps to prepare them for this season. Seeing who would fit on a true Warriors team knowing any real postseason hopes died when Klay went down.  Thanks for your concern for our team but we're just fine with Wiseman."
lamelo and oubre threw the game. too much isolations and no ball movements
"feel like the ball should be finding gordon hayward,miles bridges, and lamelo most often down the stretch"
Curry is better off ball with his movement. So he would guard the 1 and play the ‚Äú2‚Äù on offense but he would still get the ball plenty to run plays too. I never understood the argument as to not picking LaMelo.
Refs did not call 8sec violation for Hornets. Lamelo clearly did not get the ball through the halfcourt in time
"What happened with Lamelo? Iirc He was crazy hyped as possibly being the best ball brother, and it turns out that it might not be wrong?"
"Morant and lamelo ball. Those guys are just fun to watch.  But i also like watching the previous young lakers core. (Lonzo, ingram, randle, caruso)"
Here you go: [LaMelo Ball full court dime](https://streamable.com/ix7q2g)
Ok I‚Äôm a lamelo ball believer
"I will never understand how the Warriors didn't draft him. Like WTF, can you imagine LaMelo handling the ball and Steph without it and the damage they would cause?"
Lamelo doesn't have the turnovers that JWill had while still being flashy. Through two years JWill was at 20.7 TO%. Lamelo had 16.3 last year and started this year 8.4 for an average of 15.8 TO% - and with a higher USG% (19.8 vs 26.2). Even if that 8.4 is unrealistic to maintain he still takes way better care of the ball.      It makes Lamelo and his fancy passes even more impressive. And JWill was hands down my favorite PG back in the day.
"Because Caruso is the biggest meme in the nba, people love seeing him do well kinda like bartolo colon in baseball for all my baseball watchers, and the ball family name causes a media frenzy, why do u think it‚Äôs called the ‚Äúhouse of lamelo‚Äù. Because the ball name garners media attention"
"I mean Lamelo is big enough to guard 2s. We saw it all last year when he played with 6‚Äô1 Terry Rozier. There would be some trouble on defense, but can you imagine the offensive potential a Curry-Lamelo backcourt would have? You pair one of the greatest off ball players with a dynamic playmaker who has generational vision and you have dynamite.   Imagine curry and Lamelo splitting ball handling duties and running plays like the Spanish pick and roll. If rozier was deadly with Lamelo on that play think of how insane curry would be. Think of the amount of easy buckets Curry would get.   Instead the warriors draft wiseman who doesn‚Äôt make up the difference on defense (evident by his atrocious defense last year) and is honestly doesn‚Äôt fit at all in the warriors offense. Whenever I hear people talk about how the warriors drafted wiseman over Lamelo for fit it always baffled me. Sure wiseman is technically a **positional** fit, but definitely not a **system** fit and in a league where positions matter less and less I think fair to say Lamelo is a much better fit for the warriors than Wiseman is.   Even if wiseman does pan out and become a solid starter or even an all star it‚Äôll likely happen a few years down the line when curry is fast approaching 40 and Thompson and green are in their mid 30s. The warriors drafting Lamelo over wiseman will probably go down as the worst decision by the warriors front office in the curry era and will likely be responsible for shutting down their championship window."
lamelo ball = top 3 best players in charlotte history
Are you suggesting that Steph Curry should play out of position to accommodate LaMelo Ball or that the Warriors should play a mediocre shooter at SG because either way wtf
Yeah I'd absolutely hate to have Lamelo Ball coming off the bench.. /s
James Harden is a hack. Lamelo Ball is already a better point guard than Frauden and he proved that today.
You right. Ish gets the ball and just sprints down court. I can't imagine chasing him and Lamelo for 48. I think that's why we've looked so good in 2nd halves
"Unironically tho. He may have gotten to involved on bball decisions early on, but reviving the history and brand has been amazing. Bringing in Kupchak was genius. And now we have Lamelo Ball and Miles Bridges"
"All it takes is one (1) Lamelo Ball, and you can start 3-0  Why haven't other teams figured this out?"
"I honestly think we can go 82-0. I mean, would you look at this team? Let's start with the backcourt. You've got LaMelo ""Lamelon Baller"" Ball staring down Terry ""Scarence Terrence"" Rozier, slicing and dicing NBA defenses. Ish ""Prodigal Son of Charlotte"" Smith, locked in and ready to make defenders cry with his veteran smarts. James ""Bonknight"" Bouknight. Gordon ""Hair Jordan"" Hayward. When was the last time you saw a backcourt like that? And then the frontcourt. My god, it makes me weep tears of pure joy to read off these names. Miles ""Sky Miles"" Bridges. PJ ""The Capitol"" Washington. Mason ""Plumdog Millionaire"" Plumlee. Vernon ""Mount Vernon"" Carey.  And then the bench. Every time I look at this list I have to change my pants. I'm running out of pants. I'm going broke. Cody ""Which Martin is that?"" Martin. Kelly ""T$unami Papi"" Oubre. Thor. McDaniels. Jones. I'm running out of nicknames. Actually I had to go change my pants again. Lakers? They can go to the nursing home. The Hawks can fly off to the glue factory. Orlando has a team? This team doesn't follow the rules. It makes the rules. And they exercise the rule of law over the Eastern Conference. Read my lips, 82-0."
LaMelo Air-Ball
"The great thing about going for a block against Lamelo is that even if your block isn't clean, you're still going to get all Ball."
Kevin Durant &gt; Lamelo Ball
You know damn well that ESPN would never talk about Charlotte except if there were some BS LaMelo Ball to LA or New York rumors
Digging the gangster music in the background and Lamelo Ball on the scooter. Very cool.
LaMelo Ball‚Ä¶I have a younger brother around his age and LaMelo gives me those same annoying younger brother vibes. Basically trying to act out on purpose and talk big to get attention
"Yep he got a bit of a raw deal having to play over there right now. Like I get that he got a huge bag for the trouble which is nice, but for a guy who is a similar caliber of prospect to Ja Morant, Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, etc. as a creator, it has to suck that those guys are on fun teams while he toils on the Thunder."
"That reminds me of Terry‚Äôs first year with Charlotte. We were playing him as the primary ball handler at times and it was brutal to watch. But with Lamelo and Devonte last year, it made it so he basically never had to facilitate our offense and he thrived"
He doesn‚Äôt care about the stats. Both Ball Brothers jus Hoop to Win. But Lamelo will Take over unlike Lonzo. Tonight was Oubre nd Hayward night tho so why not feed them build they confidence so when Lamelo does start to use his green light they won‚Äôt be bitching nd putting their heads down.
https://imgur.com/a/iWjwXXz      If it was Lamelo on the play he would've gotten all ball
"I got to watch LaMelo Ball throat punch Ricky Rubio and flop, Chris Paul and the Suns bitch about everything, and the Lakers play full contact basketball. Great day"
"Trae, then Lamelo  Zion is a better talent than Ball but the injury/durability of big men is such a risk"
"Big difference being that Lamelo always has the ball in his hands and Scottie doesn‚Äôt. Not a knock at all, Lamelo is great, just a fact. And they aren‚Äôt even running plays yet for this kid."
"For reference the Rookie of the Year last year, LaMelo Ball, averaged 15.7 pts and 5.9 rebounds over the season. Obviously it's not a fair comparison (LaMelo was a year younger than Scottie is, a few inches smaller and plays a different game, and Barnes isn't gonna do this every game lol) but it should illustrate how impressive it is, especially in game 2 against a pretty solid team like the Celtics."
If Lamelo ball did this it would be at the top of bleacher report
"That one minute of absolute swarming defence by Charlotte was amazing and helped the Hornets run away with this game.  (A 15-0 run in 2:14 at one stage)  - 9:47 left, Mason Plumlee steals, Cody Martin scores a 2.   - 9:19 left, LaMelo Ball steals, Gordon Hayward scores 2.   - 9:11 left, LaMelo Ball steals, Cody Martin scores a 2.   - 8:44 left,  LaMelo Ball steals, Gordon Hayward scores a 3"
"LaMelo still doing that Chino Hills thing of instantly pushing the ball. Easy cherry pick to undo that dunk straight away. I love that, see Lonzo always looking up early too"
"I would take team 1.  Tatum and Embiid provide some semblance of a defensive presence for the team.  I think you have a good mix of shooting/slashing/passing on offense.  Team 2 feels a little redundant with Morant, Booker, Lamelo and Giannis all being best as primary ball handlers rather than secondary scorers.  Even Jokic is best used with the offense running through him.  Luka and Young both need the ball to be most effective, but Young is a very good 3 pt shooter and Tatum, Zion and Embiid I think could excel off ball."
lamelo ball
"Chris Duarte is going to have the best season of all the rookies this year.   Domantas Sabonis is going to be an All Star for his 3rd year in a row.   LaMelo Ball is the best Ball brother, and it's not particularly close. He legitimately may be an all star this year.   I would fake an injury if I was ever tasked with guarding Steph Curry  Russ simply will not work with the Lakers. I don't like Dennis and they shouldn't have paid him his 80 mil, but Russ is a downgrade considering his contract."

How do they outduel Lamelo Ball?
"Sexton is an ideal 6th man, and arguably would immediately be the best one in the league.  He of course could also play with another big guard that could at least share lead ball handling duties.  Lamelo, Brogdan, Barrett...lots of really nice fits if a team wanted to use him as a start too.  He's certainly not an ""inaccurate chucker"".  He's simply too efficient for either of of those adjectives together or separate.  What he is, is a ball dominant walking bucket.  That can have its downside but he'd help a lot of teams, he's just not a great fit for CLE."
Lamelo might be the best Ball brother after all. Didn't think that was possible when he was shooting 28% in New Zealand.
"A big discussion, saw them both yesterday and damn, what an incredible performance from both. Ant has made a lot of progress physically and look like he‚Äôs becoming a two-way player. He is more strong than last year and looks very mature to play in high level for a promising team that is Wolves, besides KAT and D‚ÄôAngelo. Shooting in a HIGH level on 3 pointers, the guy cooked my Rockets. But honestly im a big fan of LaMelo. 7-9 in 3 pointers and a dazzling game against the pacers. His court vision is something we dont see very often, maybe he is the next Cris Paul, only  thinking about assists. Comparing him to Ant, his defense needs to get better, but he played a great game on defense last night either, I also remember about a poke ball on Sabonis. What a player this boy is‚Ä¶ So mature, looks like he is an NBA player for ten years. To be true, if this guy have a chance to play with an All Star PF or Center, he‚Äôll probably get more than 12 assists per game. So hyped to see the Hornets this year"
Ya Lamelo runs the offense but Minnesota comes at you with all three guys getting the ball pretty evenly.
"LaMelo has the keys to the car in Charlotte, while Edwards is definitely not their number 1 option and has to share ball handling with DeAngelo"
"Ant: I think he‚Äôs become a legit defender this year. His athleticism/size combined with fire and great instincts in passing lanes defensively bodes for him to be an elite and unbeatable nba defender. He‚Äôs also a great scorer but doesn‚Äôt always have the ball in his hands  Lamelo: runs the offense, makes great passes, scores within the offense, but isn‚Äôt ever going to join Ants stratosphere defensively due to his lesser strength and quickness. But he‚Äôs a more well rounded offensive player.  Overall: I think Lamelo will always be a more impactful offensive player, but Ant absolutely closes the gap defensively."
Maybe they wanted a source lol.   https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/02/carmelo-anthony-lamelo-ball-3-point-celebration/
"How many top SG‚Äôs in the league are ‚Äúrunning around screens‚Äù tho? I‚Äôm not specifically saying that it‚Äôs going to be strenuous on his legs, I‚Äôm saying for a guy who wasn‚Äôt an amazing athlete before 2 major lower leg injuries I have my doubts he will be an All NBA level defender again or even someone you can consider a ‚Äústopper‚Äù to earn his 3&amp;D reputation.  If they took LaMelo, who doesn‚Äôt seem interested on defense, Klay is getting matched up every night with their best wing player. If they play Dallas, he gets Luka. If they play Boston, he gets Tatum or Brown. And so on and on so on. I don‚Äôt think he can match up with these guys defensively anymore. These guys are bigger, more agile, and supremely skilled with the ball in their hands. It will be a long night for him. As currently constructed with Wiggins in the starting 5 he will get that assignment and Klay on most nights won‚Äôt be depended on for his perimeter defense, at least not until he shows signs he can still be that guy.  Also I think the Wiseman pick will be the catalyst that changes slightly how you guys play 3-4 years down the line. You can‚Äôt recreate how successful the offense is without Curry or have the defensive versatility to play a talent like Dray at C. I think things will be different but with the development under their current future HOFers I can see your young guys keeping the ball rolling which almost never happens in the NBA."
"If I take my perspective from the draft yes the situation is similar the Warriors made a gamble play based on size and athleticism but I always saw Lamelo as the perfect fit in the Warriors scheme as an oversized ball handler with amazing passing. Lamelo‚Äôs downsides were more manageable as well improving shooting and defensive effort is easier then basically relearning the entire sport for Wiseman when in Warriors system. In retrospect yeah I was kinda right that Lamelo‚Äôs passing, handles were great and that his downsides were manageable he has improved both his shooting and defense. Meanwhile Wiseman still struggles with the same things he did in college and his size have brought about some health concerns. It‚Äôs up to Wiseman now to become his classes Ayton. If you aren‚Äôt skilled and talented as Embiid, Towns, or AD then it can be stretch to project physical talent for big man."
I mean warriors didn‚Äôt need a LaMelo Ball. They needed a big they could develop
"nice strawman lmao. the argument here is that when you just say ""melo"" with barely any context, don't get pissed when everyone assumes you're talking about Carmelo Anthony and not Lamelo Ball"
"If Lamelo Ball seriously turns out to be the next MJ, then I can assure you the warriors will get clowned for that for decades. But until Lamelo and Wiseman have played more than 1 season in the NBA, comparisons like that just sound ridiculous"
"Lamelo made no sense for the Warriors. You have Curry and Thompson to carry the scoring and Curry and Green to carry the Ball handling and Running the offense. Wiseman was needed for the inside and that's it. It's been less than a year for him. Dam, Let the dude for play. Yall did this to Lonzo and look how that paid off."
His name is Lamelo lmao we‚Äôre not calling him Magic Ball or something it‚Äôs literally derived from his name. He‚Äôs been called that since he was born. Carmelo has no issue with it.
"I'm saying! I initially thought at the very least Lamelo is more talented offensively and Lonzo defensively but their 1st game stat lines are wild. The more I think about it though Lamelo and Lonzo as your point and sg would PERFECT.   Not sure if it was the Ringer but I remember a podcast mentioning how Lonzo's strength is in being a ""connective tissue"" passer. While he doesn't necessarily break down defenses like his brother, he knows how to read/make smart decisions with the ball"
"LaMelo Ball. The East has an open guard spot because Kyrie won't be allowed to play because of the vaccine. LaMelo will up his stats as he's now a full time starter. 20/7/7 is likely going to be his stat line which is enough to get him in. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets starts based on fan votes like Trae Young a few years ago."
LaMelo ‚ÄúNeon Electric Banana‚Äù Ball
"&gt;They obviously do care what others think about them,  This is pretty provably false by looking at their use of social media and high prevalence of claimed mental health issues like anxiety.   Using Lamelo Ball, who is wearing head to toe designer fashion with a matching Lamborghini, as evidence of someone ""not caring what others think of them"" because of how they present themselves is a hilarious misconception of why rich celebrities flaunt their outfits and wealth to the public."

"That doesn‚Äôt matter, what does is what people said about him before and after he played there.

This year's event drew 27 NBA scouts to check on the progress of Ball and RJ Hampton, both potential top-five selections in 2020.

"&gt;To be fair I don't think Lamelo would have developed as quickly with the Warriors. Can't really play that good off ball just yet and even if Curry can do it, you want the ball in his hands as much as you can. A Curry-Lamelo backcourt wouldn't be able to share the court many minutes. Then you would have Klay coming back at some point and Jordan Poole knocking at the door."
Yes lol. They legit had no bench depth/quality there 1st 20ish games lol. Lamelo would‚Äôve fit well with curry and tooken the ball off of his hands.
Let‚Äôs touch base at all star break how does that sound? Reminder RemindME! 70 days ‚Äúlamelo ball bet
"I agree, but who you think Lamelo develops into the type of player he is now without being the primary ball handler in GSW?"
He's the first Lamelo ball
"No thanks- The Hornets don‚Äôt need a bad attitude non shooting big baby at PG, rather have Ball with the Ball LaMelo is the star and Hayward is his sidekick that glues the team together"
Dude I love that the Ball brothers continue to prove most people wrong. I was so off base at how good Lamelo could be
My league is named Lamelo ball and someone grabbed him immediately in the 2nd. Getting him pick 1 is ballsy
"#Lamelo ball is a excellent shooter  Many doubted lamelo as a shooter due to his form being a little odd. They said he would be just as poor of a shooter as lonzo. However those people don‚Äôt understand basketball and how to shoot. Lamelo has some of the best energy transfer in a basketball shot I have ever seen (up there with curry. A good way to look at energy transfer is a floppy wrist, it shows excess energy which is a good sign, however there are so many other ways like ball before body etc so I won‚Äôt complicate it) Furthermore his off hand doesn‚Äôt actually affect his shot, it comes off so early that he can fully release with one hand. Lamelo shot 37% from 3 last year as a rookie on over 6 attempts (CRAZY GOOD). I fully expect lamelo to shoot over 40% from 3 this year on a lot more attempts. Due to his fantastic energy transfer he can also shoot super deep and keep his percentages consistent similar to guys like dame. I think this year lamelo‚Äôs best skill will be his shooting. It‚Äôs a hot take now but in 6 months I don‚Äôt think it will be."
Malachi Flynn was labeled as better than LaMelo Ball
"He's not the best, the Joker is. Curry is top 5 though. Curry also is 2nd off a screen, and 1st in attempts  *Note: using the points per possession metric.* He's the only PG in the top 20 besides Lamelo Ball. Everyone else is a forward or a shooting guard. If you switch to frequency Curry is 5th and he's still basically the only PG anywhere to be found there.  Curry is also first on catch and shoot (using PTs because this stat doesn't have a PPP count), and if you sort by FGA he's 6th, again surrounded by SGs and Forwards.   Over 60% of his 3s have been assisted this season, and 40% of his 2s. Compare that to Dame, 49% &amp; 19%, or CP3 27%, and 7%.   Now compare him to a SG: CJ McCollum 65% &amp; 27%, Booker: 68% &amp; 37%,. Beal: 71% &amp; 35%.    **TLDR:** Currys shot profile is much similar to a shooting guards than a point guards.   Sources:   -	for the % of shots assisted basketball reference for each player, the shooting section.  -	[Isolation scoring](https://go.nba.com/x1zo) -	[off screen](https://go.nba.com/ckhb)"
Lol that‚Äôs just not our offence at all. Very much spread the ball when possible but terry does take a lot of iso possessions when lamelo off the floor
"Watch so more hornets games, Lamelo is not a ball dominant player, his average time of poss every time he touches the ball is almost identical to Stephs and way lower than guys who you would consider ball dominant, he also is something like 50th in mpg so he‚Äôs not sucking up a ton of minutes"
"**PG:** Ja Morant, Lamelo Ball, Seth Curry   **SG:** Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Lauri Markkanen   **PF:** John Collins, Evan Mobley   **C:** Deandre Ayton, Myles Turner, Clint Capela    Championship contender, idc what you say."
Morant/LaMelo/MikalBridges/Harris/Ayton  Bench: DJMurray/JMurray/OG/Collins/Capela  More bench: Ball/Herro/Wiggins/Isaac/Valenciunas  This roster is definitely competing
Eh I dunno. He got a very soft whistle yesterday. Shot the most FTs in the game with the 7th most FGA and a lot of jumpers.  Do you really see fouls [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-LCJeBOjKII)?  First one LaMelo loses the ball on the gather.  Second one LaMelo extends the forearm and makes contact with Lonzo‚Äôs chest.
his usage/minutes wouldnt be the same but he certainly would have shown this off the bench. he started his career off the bench for the hornets. players this good show it soon and well. stephs selflessness and off-ball ability opens so much for lamelo too. imagine what kerr can do with an elite ball handler like lamelo paired with the GOAT shooter.
"&gt;Why not?   Hard copium at this point. Talented NBA players fall into three or four tiers, generally. You have:  1. Talent that would‚Äôve been talented no matter what situation they were dropped into. You see this most often with the all time greats. The type of players who can take a 15 win team and turn them into a playoff contender simply being on the roster. i.e., Lebron, KD, KAJ, MJ, Shaq, etc.   2. Then there is talent that is talented but needs an ideal situation and circumstance for it to show. I would put Steph, Klay, and Dray in this category. They are all obviously talented players, but if Steph and Klay are born in 1968-1971 instead of 1988-1991, we never see the full level of their potential as the greatest shooting backcourt of all time bc the game was played differently. Dray may still be an all-nba player in the 90s, but if he didn‚Äôt have a coach to unlock his talents like Steve Kerr did, we probably don‚Äôt think of him as an all time great.  3. Then there is talent that is good, but not in the same level as tier 1 and 2 guys. They very often need very specific circumstances and more importantly, opportunity, to show how good they are before they are regarded as a superstar level talent. These are the guys that if you run simulations, 7/10 they end up not being the player that they are simply because of circumstances and opportunities. The Jimmy Butlers of the world.  4. Finally there is the talent that is good, not great, and ends up being a bust because time, circumstance, and opportunity was suboptimal. The Greg Oden‚Äôs and Markelle Fultz‚Äôs of the world. These guys were regarded as next level talents but for one reason or another (usually injury), it just didn‚Äôt work out at the NBA level.   Believe it or not, Lamelo is a tier 1 talent. He would‚Äôve been good wherever he went, whatever time period you dropped him in. Sure in the 80s/90s it would‚Äôve taken more time for that talent to show bc of the physicality, but his ball handling and vision literally transcends era. In the modern era that is all about pace and space offense, even more so. It‚Äôs easy to see him succeed in pairings with a rim running big like KAT, with an otherworldly shooter playing in the exact same offense he thrives in, and as a lead guard on a team with multiple good, but not great, young players with savvy vets.   At worst he‚Äôs a tier 2 talent, but that‚Äôs still pretty damn good, and it‚Äôs obvious to see now that it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered what team he went to, he still would‚Äôve been what he‚Äôs showing us now."
Lamelo is a ball dominate player and from how he‚Äôs looked so far he looks like the type of player that just needs the ball in his hands to figure it out in a trial by fire setting and starting out on the Warriors doesn‚Äôt help that
"I don‚Äôt want to get into an argument, but me talking about him here has no effect on anything whatsoever, so how is the attention he‚Äôs getting in this thread relevant to anything? It isn‚Äôt helping the Ball children, it‚Äôs not making him any $, it‚Äôs doing nothing positive for anyone. It‚Äôs not doing anything tangibly negative either, so again, if Lavar‚Äôs antics are genius because they get people talking about him or his kids on Internet forums, than maybe I have a different idea of what genius is than others. Lonzo was a top pick regardless, so he‚Äôd be talked about and known by NBA fans anyway. Lamelo looks to be easily on his way to being an all-star, so he‚Äôd be talked about and known as well. There‚Äôs nothing tangible you can attribute to Lavar‚Äôs antics, so this is really just a thought experiment either way.     I think your definition of genius is pretty broad and much easier to attain than it should be. I think Lavar is a pretty ridiculous public figure. And I think we just disagree on it, which is fine.    As an aside, I don‚Äôt know anything about the Pet Rock ‚Äòinventor‚Äô, but I do think it‚Äôs a stupid ass thing. But according to Wikipedia, the fad lasted 6 months, the rock costs $4, so it is what it is. If your line of thinking is that it‚Äôs genius to market idiocy to idiots, than you probably think demagogues are geniuses too. Again, I‚Äôd disagree, but we‚Äôre just two anonymous strangers, so who cares."

"Who's filling out the SF, PF, and C spots? If it's just role players, then they're a non-playoff team. If you put a good All-Star next to them (i.e Paul George, healthy Zion, Butler, etc.), I'd say 2nd round exit.   A good, fun, contending lineup for the Ball bros would be:  Lamelo, Lonzo, Paul George, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bam Adebayo  LiAngelo is your 11th/12th man"
It certainly worked against us on Friday. It's actually kind of stressful to score against you guys because you know the ball is shooting out of the Lamelo cannon into another highlight.
Our defensive gameplan is to get the ball back as quick as possible so Lamelo can do something fun. If that means giving up 2 or 3 points every possession so be it!
LaMelo ball
LaMelo flopping on his older brother lmfao  ball dont lie tho
"&gt;was just saying outrageous stuff for publicity. This guy managed to get 3 sons to play professionally  I don't know that I think he's ""bad"", but there certainly is a lot to be desired from how he portrays himself, and I'd argue that with the exception of LiAngelo, he probably has hurt more than helped as far as their careers.  I do think the publicity and exposure for LiAngelo helped a fair bit.       With that said, your comment made me realize that they are just the modern day Barry's.   Rick was a vocal jerk too, and got 5!! kids playing pro-ball.       In this scenario Brent == LaMelo, Jon == Lonzo, and Canyon/Drew/Scooter == LiAngelo."
"He's as strict as they come. I think (obviously)...  I've only seen a few interactions and take it all with a grain of salt, since it's usually curated by the Ball family what they put out and publicize. That said, I once saw a video clip on IG or something idk, and it was Lamelo and he looked pretty old, so like, not that long ago, and his dad and someone else and Lamelo said something and I can't remember what it was but I'm thinking it was something like ""heck yeah lol go off on these nuts"" or something (idk, it doesnt matter), and Lavar just looks at Lamelo with this intense glare and Lamelo just folded instantly and ran inside like a child does when his father is upset and was instantly holding back tears with his eyes red and telling the camera person to go away.  You just know Lavar was a terrifying father, but clearly it was from a position of love, because I feel like at this point those boys have enough resources to distance themselves from him if it came from a different place."
"Terry Rozier, Carmelo Anthony, LaMelo Ball all had worse 2FG seasons recently. As I said it's bad but not catastrophic"
Lamelo ball surely has to be 3rd team   And I say mobley as ROTY.  And Davis shouldn‚Äôt be 3rd team he currently has the worst 3p percentage ever for over 2 attempts per game
"In some ways they both are now. Prime Westbrook was a beast but he wasn't scalable.  Scalability is underrated in this sub. It's what made the KD Warriors so ridiculously good. Both Curry and KD are massively scalable stars.  Ball dominant players tend to be less scalable. Westbrook was undeniably a top 5 player in his prime but if added to the Warriors would be a detriment to them.   Lamelo and Ja are both high IQ players with great vision. Either could be moved to the Nets, Warriors or Lakers rn and improve them massively. Even in his prime there were massive doubts on whether Brodie could do the same.  If I wanted to make a bad team good I'm taking Brodie everyday. But if I wanted to make a good team great Lamelo and Ja are who I'd go with."
Is that really true though? What Americans players are in outside leagues and are good enough to be on nba rosters? Lamelo played pro ball in Australia but it‚Äôs pretty rare I think.
"?! Lamelo. Obviously. Not even close LOL. Zion is a heliocentric system kind of star. Take the ball away from him and he's quite useless offball. Lamelo is atheltic, high bbiq, tends to play unselfish ball and a style of basketball that doesnt Overly rely on athletism. Even if he peaks as a 2nd option, his value for a team is simply not comparable. If you pick up Zion, you're hoping he carries u to finals/chip. But with guys like Curry , KD , Giannis, Bron still playing in the league? Yeah good luck ""carrying"" Zion, im gona take Lamelo and actually build a competitive modern team ."
"Lamelo ball is one of the better drivers in the NBA, is a very big guard, and somehow only averages less than 3 free-throw a game. The NBA is totally screwed and honestly the new rule changes have just given the Refs more ways to manipulate"
"LaMelo.  A ball handler who can run and offense and shoot off the dribble is a lot more valuable than a big who is a super efficient high 20s PPG scorer. And obviously there's injury risks and the fact that Zion is a negative defender as a big, which makes the decision easy imo."

"Lonzo Ball is an absolutely excellent PG and role player, but LaMelo ball is already easily the better player.  EDIT: Lonzo is a 22 million per year contract player, and LaMelo is a max contract type of player. Both, the Bulls and the Hornets are extremly happy with what they got."
LaMelo is already better. In the next 10 minutes. I never saw it coming but here we are.  No disrespect to Lonzo either but he's never gonna be an All Star PG like Melo might be.   After all the Ball family drama I'm amazed 2/3 worked out so well. Apparently LaVar isn't a *complete* moron.
"I kind of like LaMelo's passing more.   I feel like Zo's is a little more 'quarterback' style, and Melo's has a bit more 'finesse.' LaMelo is also a bit more daring with the passes he attempts. And so it looks like he has eyes on the back of his head with just the way he hits his teammates with the ball.  There should be an all-star passing competition where we get to see Jokic and LaMelo go at it üòÑ"

"I actually agree, the stats are nearly identical and was surprised after taking a look:  Harden: 20.7 / 7.6 / 9.2 on shooting splits of 41.4/ 37.8 / 89.4 (4.9 TO)  Ball: 19.9 / 7.8 / 7.5 on shooting splits of 41.7/ 38.8 / 90.7 (3.1 TO)  I'd still take Harden because the Nets are #1 in the East and the stats slightly favor him, but Lamelo is definitely on pace for his first All-Star nod this year"
&gt;Lamelo Ball  Think you misspelled Harden
Lamelo Ball is pretty much Jason Kidd. Congrats Hornets on drafting a star PG for the next decade and a bit.
Aaaand they got  bonked and lost a game to lamelo ball lole
"Lamelo ""Patrick Mahomes'"" Ball"
They were scared off by noted rim protector LaMelo Ball
Starting to see some of the same stuff with Lamelo and Ant. I just wanna see all the small markets stars ball out!
i‚Äôd say Ants on ball defense= Melo off ball as he is always active on the passing lanes and when Lamelo shot isn‚Äôt falling he is still able to impact the game in multiple ways and his rebounds shouldn‚Äôt just be overlooked as useless since he constantly pushes the pace of his rebounds and gets east transition looks
"So you‚Äôre 12 then?  LeBron, KD, Curry, Luka, Trae, Lillard, Giannis, Harden, Jokic, Embiid, that‚Äôs 10 with Kawhi out.  AD, Booker, Beal, CP3, Paul George, Butler, Tatum, Brown, Beal, Mitchell, KAT, Gobert, Zion is out, Irving is out, and that‚Äôs the top 25.    If Ball wasn‚Äôt a terrible defender with poor scoring efficiency he‚Äôd be top 25, but he‚Äôs certainly not there now.    Young players improve quickly.  Ant‚Äôs D puts him a lot higher than he would be if he was playing defense like last year.  LaMelo needs to figure Defense out and become more efficient."

"Ayton ans Shai definitely over Ant and LaMelo for sure. I would put some of the rookies this year over Ball as well, he's not in my top 10."
Check out miles Bridges stretch on bball reference game logs when LaMelo went out with the broken hand. Bridges was given the keys to the offense a six week stretch right before ball came back and that‚Äôs where the numbers blow up.
"You're massively underrating SGA here. In the 35 games where he was healthy last year, OKC was 16-19, with a roster that everyone agrees is shit. If you give him a roster where Dort is the fourth best player instead of his only reliable teammate, he could do what Booker, Lavine and Mitchell are doing/have been doing.  Imo he should be 6 on this list at minimum, he is debatably top 4. His case is another instance of people here disrespecting a legitimately great player because his supporting cast is pure dog shit. Swap Ayton for SGA and the Thunder would be 7-59 Charlotte levels of shit because Ayton needs an elite passer like Rubio or Paul to give him the ball. On top of that he is hell bent on shitty finesse moves instead of bullying people in the post.  He's also far better than Edwards. He's a very entertaining player to watch but he isn't as well rounded as SGA. It's definitely a debate over LaMelo, Fox and SGA but I'd give Shai the edge over Fox because of his shooting and the edge over Melo because of his scoring"
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
1. Luka Doncic 2. Ja Morant 3. Trae Young 4. Zion Williamson 5. Jayson Tatum 6. Anthony Edwards 7. Lamelo Ball 8. DeAaron Fox 9. Tyler Herro 10. SGA
"Draft assets, Terry Rozier/Gordon Hayward? LaMelo and Bridges look to be the young core going forward and paring them with Turner would be great. Rozier is a bit redundant as a third ball handler and not exactly on their timeline. Hayward too, but even more so."
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"Dude as an Aussie it was even weirder hearing about this kid because his dad played in the NBL and played NOTHING like him, it would be like if Andre Roberson had a kid who ended up being LaMelo Ball."
LaMelo Ball attempts a self-oops!\*
"shit like this will make the coach mad he can't *retroactively* bench him like ""Actually LaMelo Ball was DNP - Coach's Decision today""  One way or another they need to humble him a little, a second-year player shouldn't have the confidence to try this shit up *two*"
From a distance duarte kinda looks like young lamelo ball playing nba basketball
"Lamell literally kicked the ball with his heel in the backcourt right before that dunk he had because he was fckin around In front of the ref. Nothing. Also start of the half, ref whistles some Hornet inbounds the ball Lamelo gets down to tie the shoe, KCP gets the ball and then ref requests the ball back from him ‚ÄúLamelo wasnt ready‚Äù type shit. NBA is a fuckkn show not a basketball game"
"I guess coming from my perspective it‚Äôs a bit rich, but I really get tired of the Bleacher Report and Friends BBall perspective, where the only teams that exist are A. Wherever LeBron is, B. The Lakers (where LeBron currently is, so double focus), and C. Wherever any of the Ball brothers are (congrats Charlotte, national media cares more about the current team than Kemba bringin the Heat to 7 games in 2016).  I get it‚Äôs what makes money, but when it‚Äôs all you get shown, you get tired of it. I know I have- I honestly don‚Äôt really care about LaMelo anymore, and probably haven‚Äôt since like 2017"
"This is true, I‚Äôd assume these guys in the East will get voted as locks before anyone else goes in.  Durant  Giannis  Embiid  Jimmy Butler  Harden  Lavine  DeRozan  LaMelo Ball  Beal  That‚Äôs 9 already, Trae Young always polls well so he‚Äôll probably be in contention for a spot so that‚Äôs 10.  Not gonna be a lot of space for Herro to get a spot."
LaMelo Ball.
I still compare Lamelo and Ant so I'm super salty with the season Ball is having. Starting to get over it though since I have no problems with the Hornets
"Between the two,  Lamelo:  ‚Ä¢Higher PER (17.5 vs 13.9) and TS% (.539 vs .523) ‚Ä¢Higher ORG (1.2 vs .8), DRG (4.7 vs 3.8) RPG (5.9 vs 4.7) As well as higher rebound percentages ‚Ä¢Higher APG (6.1 vs 2.9) and AST% (33.9 vs 14.6) ‚Ä¢Higher SPG (1.6 vs 1.1) and STL% (2.7 vs 1.7) ‚Ä¢Lower usage percentage (26.1 vs 27) ‚Ä¢Higher win shares (2.8 vs .8), box score +/- (1.9 vs -2.6) and VORP (1.4 vs -.3)  Edwards:  ‚Ä¢Higher PPG (on more FGA per game [16.8 vs 13.2] more 3PA per game [7.2 vs 5.1] on a higher 3PAr [.429 vs .388] and more FTA per game [3.8 vs 3.2], also less efficient scorer than Ball when using TS% and FG%, while also having a lower efficient field goal percentage.) ‚Ä¢Higher BPG (.5 vs .4) and BLK% (1.3 vs 1.2) ‚Ä¢Less turnovers per game (2.2 vs 2.8) ‚Ä¢Less personal fouls per game (1.8 vs 2.7)  The only argument that can be made for Edwards is totals, due to Ball missing 21 games due to injury. Lamelo led or nearly tied Anthony in virtually every statistical metric with the exception of PPG (which Edwards won handily, but this point is easily refutable due to Ball‚Äôs higher efficiency and shooting percentages.)  Statistically, Ball was the better player."
"Personally I do find dominant ISO ball to be kinda boring. I love seeing teams click, I love watching Nash run the break and Marion Amare and the rest all filling the lanes and seeing the defenders panic. I love a perfectly-timed backcut for a layup. I love seeing Lamelo thread the needle right by two defenders' heads and his teammate almost isn't ready for it.  That's more fun to me than seeing, like, PG catch the ball on the elbow, doing some jabs and a dribble stepback, even if it goes in."
"I literally said I misread what he said. And yes, lamelo is a top 3 ball."
delusional fans said they would rather have someone that has a ceiling of Ayton instead of Lamelo Ball a future allstar and face of a franchise ü§£
"Different question but in your opinion, say Lamelo Ball and Cade Cunningham (also big high IQ card with excellent instincts/touch/feel) fill out their potential   What will separate Luka from those two?"
Anthony Davis  Giannis Jokic  Jayson Tatum Zion if healthy (not lookin likely but still) Ja Morant  Joel Embiid  Lamelo Ball Anthony Edwards Deandre Ayton  Evan Mobley  Emoni Bates  Bronny Jr Victor Wembayana  These are just the standout talents of you told me they are going to be the best player in the world I can clearly see why   What is Luka‚Äôs why?
To me it‚Äôs not wrong considering Lamelo is on pace to averaging close to a triple double this year as a non ball-dominant player. He still hasn‚Äôt grown fully into his man body and hasn‚Äôt even played 82 games yet. I firmly believe a couple years from now the narrative will be Luka vs Lamelo similar to magic vs bird. They are both 6-7 playmaking guards who can score. Luka is far ahead of Lamelo right now as a scorer/closer but he‚Äôs a few years older and they have entirely different games. As a Charlotte fan I am bias but Lamelo is still improving rapidly so to me this is a future conversation

"Luka is a ball hog lamelo isnt lol people have to watch lamelo play the keys not even in his hands yet fr , Luka usage rate has been high as hell"
Why not scarier?  The Warriors without Melo are already looking like they could be comparable to the Duncan-era Spurs.  The #1 seed in the league + Klay Thompson + LaMelo Ball.
Lamelo is probably the least ball-dominant offensive engine in the league. Half the time he doesn‚Äôt even fully bring the ball up the court as he‚Äôs constantly looking for quick hit aheads.   And Curry is one of the best off-ball players‚Ä¶ it would have been a match-made in basketball heaven.  One of the best passers in the league routinely finding the best shooter in the league ‚Äî how can people not think this would work?
"we need the previous sequence too, Bridges blew an alleyoop dunk, the Wiz got the rebound, but LaMelo just popped the ball out and Cody Martin came down with the loose ball to set this up."
LaMelo Ball is already a top 15 player
Lamelo Ball (sophomore) and Giddey (rookie) deserve a specific mention.
fun fact: cade cunningham is only one month younger than reigning RotY LaMelo Ball
Hornets lamelo BALL
"Please stop pouring milk on LaMelo Ball, it is weird ü•õ"
"The Hornets at times have excellent, almost Spursian or Warriorish ball movement, apart from Oubre and Terry. Miles, LaMelo, Cody Martin, and Plumlee all move the ball especially well for the position and it‚Äôs not uncommon to have five, six passes lead to a shot when we‚Äôre clicking.   I‚Äôve also been impressed that LaMelo doesn‚Äôt just try to pass into assists (like some stat-padding guys). He does what‚Äôs best to create for the offense and doesn‚Äôt seem hyper focused on stats."
Let‚Äôs breakdown their stats all the way.   Trae is shooting 44% on 19 shots per with 5 free throws per (90%). He is shooting 36% from 3 on 6 attempts per game. He turns the ball over 4.1 times per.   Lamelo is shooting 41% on 17 shots per with 2 free throws per (93%). He shoots 39% from 3 on 7 attempts per and turns the ball over 3.1 times per game. He is also grabbing four more rebounds than Trae.   The major difference in ppg is free throws (and as someone who watches Lamelo a lot he gets fouled without getting the call so much. The whole team really just gets hosed on foul calls). I‚Äôm too lazy to check the advanced metrics but I‚Äôve been looking at them pretty frequently and Lamelo and Trae are always within a few spots of each other except for defensive metrics (which we all know Trae is considerably worse).   So yea I would think they are pretty similar in terms of player quality as far as the stats go. Your particular leaning determines which player you think is ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù

"Honestly while lamelo does get a ton of legit dimes, some of the assists that got counted in todays NBA are really wack. I remember seeing a couple where he legit handed the ball off to rozier and bridges who actively shook off of a defender and take like 5+ dribbles get counted as assists"
"Uh, this could not be more wrong. Unbelievably silly statement. LaMelo grabbing the rebound is an instant fast break with his full court passing ability. Him grabbing the board gets our break started IMMEDIATELY. LaMelo's rebounding is also massive for us because we absolutely need it as a small ball team without an even average center. He has to get back and help crash the boards if we have a chance of competing. Also, he grabs PLENTY of contested rebounds over centers. He's almost prescient at it."
"LaMelo ""despite the loss"" Ball"
"Because Michael Jordan is an asshat of an owner. Lamelo is the closest thing to a decent piece on that team. Do you really think Lamelo Ball should be compared to a generational talent that can arguably become a top 10-20 player of all time?   And I‚Äôm not really a Laker fan. I‚Äôm just a fan of good basketball. The lakers were my childhood team, but these days I don‚Äôt really have a favorite team. I simply made this my flair when Kobe died and never even thought to change it. But if name calling makes you feel better, whatever. Not sure why you‚Äôre talking about the hornets and ball as if they‚Äôre your family or something.   And, sorry, but the hornets won‚Äôt make it to the second round with lamelo ball as their best player. Ever. And if he ever becomes more than just a fringe all star, it won‚Äôt be as a hornet. It has nothing to do with being a small market. Save this post in a remind and laugh in my face if I‚Äôm ever wrong."
Lamelo Ball. Always hated seeing those videos of him in hs games with what seemed like a ridiculous play style and him putting up stupid numbers. Butthe guy can play
If my goal is to win a playoff series I‚Äôm easily taking Jrue Holiday over Lamelo Ball    I like Lamelo more long term but as of now I think Trae still clearly had the edge
"And Magic drafted Lonzo Ball over this dude because he believed on the fabricated hype smh That shit still upsets me, how can anyone in their right mind could fall for Lavar's bullshit? At least LaMelo is showing some sparks, but Lonzo never looked like a top 3 draft pick then, neither he looks nowadays, Magic was a complete idiot"
"Not only that but this knife cuts both ways. Melo is AMAZING and his talent/potential has completely changed the trajectory of the franchise, but if you read articles like [this one](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/11/1/22756535/lamelo-ball-charlotte-hornets) you'll see that Miles is just as responsible for pulling Melo along as Melo is for pulling Miles along.  &gt; After an injury to his right wrist derailed his long-range shooting at the end of last season, Ball set out to correct it by training at a pace of more than a thousand makes a day. **Bridges ‚Äúdragged‚Äù Ball with him to the weight room, until LaMelo wound up ranking in the top three among Hornets in total offseason lifts at the team facility. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna put the work in,‚Äù Bridges says, ‚Äúno matter what.‚Äù**  BUZZ FUCKING BUZZ MOTHERFUCKERS."
"He would‚Äôve looked great in Golden State too. Lamelo is the prototype player for the system Golden State uses. I really really *really* wish y‚Äôall would at least watch him play or check the stats before making these generalizations.   He is not the player you think he is and he doesn‚Äôt play the way you think he does. It‚Äôs why everyone can‚Äôt stop talking about him and the Warriors because if you watch his games and watch Golden State, it‚Äôs pretty damn clear that the passing vision, the off ball movement, and the way he spaces the floor would boost everything about Golden State‚Äôs offense.  He is a talent that would‚Äôve been good no matter where he went. Sucks that we couldn‚Äôt see him tag team with Draymond and Steph."
"People consistently get this wrong about Lamelo. Everyone thinks he dominates the ball, but no, he doesn‚Äôt. His usage is around 26% which is the same as Jordan Poole and averages about 4 seconds per touch which is the same as Zach Lavine. He completely plays within the offense.   So he would be able to do his thing in Minnesota, especially so having a big man as talented as KAT where he can consistently pick n pop with or set him up for rim attacks, and he would look amazing in Golden State where he could also be a back door cutter or set Steph and Draymond up for those same looks (he also plays well off ball).   This kid is versatile and flexible and he shares the ball which bodes well for him wherever he would‚Äôve landed. He would‚Äôve been the same player or even better in both situations. Watch his games and that becomes evident."
"I agree his stats would be down because he‚Äôs next to Curry but he would have fit like a glove into the Warriors offense. He‚Äôs honestly kind of even perfect to be the main handler (with Curry off ball). Dray is great but he‚Äôs not a threat scoring. Melo is.   LaMelo‚Äôs IQ and feel for the game is crazy. It just comes natural for him. One thing that makes the Warriors offense so great is that everyone is unselfish. LaMelo is the type to make the pass to the pass to the assist. He‚Äôll gladly give up a good shot for a better one.   I agree his off ball skills would need some work but hey Curry is right there. And I assume he‚Äôll be more on ball anyway because he‚Äôs easily be the most well rounded offensive player outside of Curry, who does a lot of off ball. Dray could set up a lot more off ball screens. LaMelo and Curry would‚Äôve been fun asl ngl."
"If LaMelo wasn‚Äôt a Ball Bro he would‚Äôve went number 1 easily. It took him so long to shake off his reputation. Tbh he only really got rid of it because his talent was just undeniable. But it was always there. D1 recruits 4-5 years older than him couldn‚Äôt stop him when he was a 5‚Äô9 freshman. When he was the shortest and weakest player on the court. I always thought he was too skilled to fail.   The year he grows to 6‚Äô2 he has a 92 point game. It was obvious he was special then people were saying it. Everyone knew he was going to end up 6‚Äô6-6‚Äô7. What surprised me was he started to pass like Zo when he has his spurt but he was always a natural scorer unlike Zo.   Lithuania was a flop, but no doubt in my mind Melo should‚Äôve been more highly rated right after that. Ik the league was made by his dad but watch his JBA highlights. His stat lines and the shit he was pulling off was ridiculous. Nobody took the comp seriously but it was easily better than HS basketball. He was a 16 year old 6‚Äô6 PG dropping 40 point triple doubles. An elite and complete offensive skill set outside of his jumpshot (but he always had great touch). And it was clear his athleticism hadn‚Äôt even come in yet. Yet nobody took him seriously as a prospect. He wasn‚Äôt even considered a second round pick. I wonder why‚Ä¶."

"if my team passed on Lamelo for James Wiseman  I would‚Äôve thought of a million excuses and reasons to why Lamelo wouldn‚Äôt ball out on the dubs, I don‚Äôt blame you dude."
Good point. For some reason I think DLo would still get more touches on ball than Lamelo would tho
Lamelo got to the right situation with Hornets. The team lets him do his thing with the ball in his hands. He wouldn‚Äôt get to do that if he went 1 to Minnesota or 2 to golden state
Luka isn‚Äôt the only franchise changer. Also look at the usage rates‚Ä¶ LaMelo doesn‚Äôt need to be ball dominate to influence the game. Not a knock on Luka but you‚Äôre denial is prob an limitless so go off king!
"I don‚Äôt know if you understand the difference between usage and ball dominant. Steph is an extremely high usage player who doesn‚Äôt need to dominate the ball. 75% of our halfcourt possessions are basically initiated by Draymond lol. Luka is an example of one who needs to control basically every touch.   Lamelo leans more towards the Luka archetype as a heliocentric primary initiator of the hornets offense, he does basically nothing off ball that adds value other than occasionally crash the boards."
"I definitely wasn't a huge LaMelo guy all through HS, but when I learned he was 6'8"" and still running the point like we used to see...it felt like that ""how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?"" meme. Draft the lengthy ball handler that can kind of shoot!"
Lamelo Ball is a dog. His shooting will come but he‚Äôs showing serious flashes of stardom already. Dude can Ball.
Bridges is the tantalizing prospect for me after lamelo. He's a hybrid wing/big who has shown flashes of being able to put the ball on the floor and shoot.    Bridges and LaMelo are going to be like GP and Kemp.
Right? Who knew lamelo ball would be chosen one 2.0.
"Lamelo treats the ball like a hot potato which is good. Reminds me of Jason Kidd.  Big guard, big board bombs it  down the court quicker than any guard could run"
"Is there a consensus on who's the better Ball brother? It seems like LaMelo is getting more attention as he's new to the league and putting up good numbers, and that Lonzo, while still good, doesn't have a spotlight on him anymore and isn't putting up numbers as good as his brother."
"I ranked them via letter count, (least to most):  -Ja Morant  -De'Aaron Fox  -LaMelo Ball  -Collin Sexton  -Shai Gilgeous Alexander"
Floor/Current:  1. Ja Morant 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 4. Collin Sexton 5. LaMelo Ball  Ceiling/Potential:  1. Ja Morant 2. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 3. De'Aaron Fox/LaMelo Ball 4. Collin Sexton
"Think it's a little unfair to lump Ball in with guys who have at least a full season under their belts, I can't pretend I've seen enough of LaMelo to rank him seriously in here. I'd tier em:  Tier One   1. SGA 2. Ja  Tier Two  1. Fox 2. Sexton 3. Ball"
That was LaMelo Ball-esque.
"To circle way back around on this, if you‚Äôd posted something like:  ‚ÄúLaMelo Ball is currently Top 25 in APG while playing just under 25 MPG‚Äù and put in the body ‚ÄúCaris Lavert is the only other player in the Top 25 in APG under 30 MPG‚Äù  I think your response would have been quite different. Or, post about both Ball &amp; Lavert and you might spark an interesting discussion about both players.  Post that again later and see how it goes"
I HAVE SEEN IT. LAMELO BALL IS THE GOAT AND PEOPLE ARE JEALOUS. PERIOD.
"After 10 games, aside from the other top 24, Lamelo Ball has the most assists per game."
"*After 10 games, Caris Lavert and LaMelo Ball are the only players in the top 25 in assists per game with less than 30 mpg played."
Put some respect on Lonzo and LaMelo.  Way different ways of getting into NBA and adjusting. LaMelo has the advantage of Lavar Ball being quiet and in the background instead of how he was with Zo and I'm sure that played a part in his development. He learned from that and is leaving Melo do his thing.
"Comes down to a few things:  Age is the primary factor, as you more often get rookies in the MLB in the mid-20s than in the NBA. By that time, these players have had 2-3 years of playing in season-long leagues against similar caliber competition. Players don't otherwise debut until they're ""ready,"" and there isn't much development expected once they reach the major league level.   You also have the strength and conditioning that comes into play. There is a big difference in the body of a 20 year old and a 23 year old. We've seen an influx of highly successful MLB rookies lately, and it's likely that they've basically been groomed for it since they were playing little league. There is a lot of support and great coaching beyond just high school and travel ball for young baseball players. Those skills camps that are more often just a charity event for the NBA are legit businesses for little league parents who can afford it.   Just look at Luka, Lamelo, etc, players with some kind of ""pro"" experience before coming into the league. Their game is more polished than someone joining right after high school. That really does make a difference, and is basically why the minor league system in the MLB exists."
"yeah lamelo ball also outplayed trae young, what's your point."
LaMelo Ball gonna get FMVP
"Lamelo is gonna be the best one of them all.  However , love I Lonzo‚Äôs intangibles and know he could be a killer on a team that emphasizes transition.  Lamelo will be beastly regardless cause he has a more refined offensive  skillet set.  Really hope Lonzo finds a team/coach that lets him run all the time with the ball in his hands. I think he could be one of the best transition players and def the best transition passer of all time."
"both the ball brothers play on the court in a way that is almost the exact opposite of the 'brand' of lavar.  Both are quiet, very willing to pass teammates, they don't chase stats they move the ball fast and focus on transition.    They both have incredible intangibles from devoting their life to it. Lamelo has got some extra sauce to his game and now hornets finally will get national tv and people tuning in.  Don't mess this up Mitch!"
"His form still isn't great, but there are enough positive signals to suggest his jump shot could develop further. Lonzo had a tendency to miss left and right which meant he had to completely overhaul his jumper. I haven't seen that as much with LaMelo, and his touch / ball rotation seems fairly solid despite his form. I could see LaMelo becoming an excellent shooter with some footwork adjustments and by bringing his shooting pocket a bit more up and a bit less out in front."
how so? Lonzo can‚Äôt run a halfcourt offense. He‚Äôs an elite 3/D role player who is great with the ball in transition. If they played together you‚Äôd definitely want LaMelo at the one.
lonzo always had some serious shot creating questions tho even coming into the league. he just doesnt have the handles to be a legit creator in the half court.   thats not really the concern with lamelo tho. with lamelo its more so how good can he get at that. thats why a lotta people considered him the best ball brother even before he was in the league or at least has the potentially to be the best  lonzos big scoring games are usually from him getting hot from 3. lamelo has shown an actual ability to get to the rim that lonzo has never shown
There is only one person in the NBA referred to as Melo and it sure isn't LaMelo Ball.
"One more stupid question. I thought back when LeBron went straight to the NBA from High School, he was the last generation of players allowed to do so, and the NBA required players to go through college ball first before being drafted...? So, how is it that Lamelo is able to play in the league at 19.5 years old? Or am I just completely wrong from the get-go?"
"LaMelo Ball is going to be an MVP and a star in this league. I said it and I am never taking that back.  I just hope they can build a better team around him, otherwise he will be taking his talents elsewhere."
My first thought was that I actually attributed my good ft% in high school to how much 21 I played in the summers. That game is all about making 3 fts and getting the ball back lol not sure about lamelo yet but lonzo is a horrific free throw shooter
Kinda crazy that a big man like Wiseman is averaging fewer rebounds than Lamelo Ball per game. If you think wiseman has all the tools to develop you must have not been watching 19 year old Ball play yet.
"Let‚Äôs not fucking call LaMelo ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù. There‚Äôs one Melo in the NBA, and it‚Äôs not a ball brother."
"&gt;I saw someone say Shaun Livingston if he never got hurt and I shed a tear. Obviously a lot of people will bring up Michael Carter williams but he seems to be much less ball dominant and has way more raw talent.  They play literally nothing alike my guy.  LaMelo Ball is a flashy offensive talent with a penchant for elite passing vision, and the potential to be a triple double machine in the future. He uses his size well, whereas Livingston was more of a dynamic guard who could've literally just plowed through players with his elite vertical and intense athleticism coupled with stellar ability to play the passing lanes. Livingston was an underrated passer, but LaMelo Ball makes passes that literally seem impossible to pull off. That being said, Livingston probably could've dominated the NBA after his junior year, with how well he was playing as a two-way guard. He was well on his way. Still, much respect to the man for coming back and playing  12 more years after that gruesome injury."

I'd say both ball brothers are streaky. Lamelo has had a few good early games though. More than Lonzo if i remember right
No it‚Äôs because lamelo ball went 3rd in the draft.... nephews these days really don‚Äôt know anything it‚Äôs crazy
[$500/month sounds pretty semi-pro to me.](https://www.businessinsider.com/liangelo-ball-lamelo-ball-may-sign-lithuanian-basketball-team-2017-12)
"Quite honestly, we never saw Lonzo Ball at any level show the scoring capability that LaMelo has. LaMelo was more lethal to score as a sophomore in HS than Lonzo was as a freshman at UCLA."
Man.. you think that LaMelo didn‚Äôt *have* to play ball his whole upbringing? I said he played more than ‚Äúmost‚Äù players in the league in his youth. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs even arguable.
"I'm a Warriors fan, and would have preferred LaMelo just because he's the better player and we absolutely need a second playmaker besides Steph. I can see LaMelo fitting exceptionally in our second unit as well as with Steph off-ball."
Agree. I would love this have him in Golden State. You can never have too many 6'8 guards who have elite ball-handling and playmaking. LaMelo is a far more polished player than Wiseman at the moment. I think he would absolutely dominate in our second unit and with off-ball Steph.
I hate anyone calling Melo for Lamelo Ball.
Who? LaMelo Ball? That kid from middle school?
"I would like to point out that LaMelo was absolutely *not* balling last year. He played on the worst team in the league, who's key ball-handlers were out the whole year. LaMelo was just the guy there by default and if often wasn't pretty. One of the worst looking shots, one of the worst defenders. His passing vision was clear as day but everything else was such a worry.  He did not look good. He's playing better in the NBA than he did in the NBL by a wide, wide margin. It's great to see."
"Quite honestly, we never saw Lonzo Ball at any level show the scoring capability that LaMelo has. LaMelo was more lethal to score as a sophomore in HS than Lonzo was as a freshman at UCLA. Now LaMelo has grown a foot and he still seems to have that same scoring prowess. Lonzo was always a distributor who could dunk and light it up from time to time."
"Flynn is as raw or rawer than Ball, which says something about his ceiling. So far Flynn hasn‚Äôt had the same leash yet with healthy FVV/Lowry/Davis/Powell even Matt Thomas as SG. We got plenty of guards.  I‚Äôd give Flynn a year or two before comparing him to anyone. He might be more like a Curry than Lamelo."
I said from the very start I believe Lamelo would be the best Ball brother.
"I'm taking that Ball boy, 100%. Just from a longevity perspective, LaMelo will have an easier time in the league due to his size. Often the smallest guy on the floor gets picked on. But I just like LaMelo's game way better than Trae's. JMO since I know some folks are gonna be in their feelings about it."
"actually as a UCLA fan i watched the whole season. Lonzo was the 2 for that season with Aaron Holiday being our half court PG most of the time, Lamelo is more ball dominant player in the half court and can create his own shot more consistently. just because they both hit deep threes sometimes doesn‚Äôt mean they played any bit alike."
I know I‚Äôve watched every Hornets game because he was my preferred rook but he isn‚Äôt that effective off ball which means we would be running a lot of actions through a rookie and that means Draymond is less effective because of his lack of offense. If you run Steph and Dray short rolls it works because Draymond sees the floor well and makes the right read. With LaMelo there‚Äôs too many hands in the pot and I wasn‚Äôt sure if his offense would be good enough as a rookie to warrant it. DLo is seen as a better offensive player who is ball dominant with bad defense and that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt work. With LaMelo it would have been the same way.
"Really though, I bet Lamelo put in more minutes playing ball from 3-15 yrs old than most players in the league. I doubt he had an option lol"
"Yeah Minny already realized they probably fucked up, but I think there's a possibility that the Warriors also have regrets down the road, depending on Wiseman's development.  Anything short of Giannis/Embiid outcome and I believe Warriors would pick Ball in a re-do.    LaMelo looks like the most skilled player on the floor in most of the games he's in and he's only 19.  The person guarding him is always scared he'll make them look silly."
raptors fans whined that lamelo ball highlights were making the front page while flynn highlights didn't despite him supposedly playing better in the pre-season.
" Now all of them will say ball , next time when trae puts 30/10 and lamelo play bad all of them will say trae , bad timing to ask that question"
He's been playing more off the ball which he is much better suited for. He's can't run/initiate an offense but with the addition of LaMelo we don't need him to handle the ball as much.
i‚Äôm pretty sure graham turned the ball over instead of passing it to lamelo on purpose at the end when they were late game fouling/trapping
"It‚Äôs kind of crazy how much this sub discounts playmaking &amp; bbiq. The warriors would be insanely awesome with Dray, Steph, &amp; Melo play making &amp; finding guys for open looks and back cuts.   In Minnesota, Melo would do the one thing no one else on the Wolves seems willing to do which is get the ball to KAT. That big mfer would average 30 on insane efficiency will Melo on his team.   If u can playmake and shoot well enough to get guarded (which lamelo does), u can be plugged into any team and instantly make them better.   Ten games into his NBA career with a year layoff from his last game, no summer league, a four game preseason &amp; this kid is already helping his team win games. He‚Äôs gonna be a star."
"I never believed in the first Ball. Still don't.  But LaMelo is different. When it's all said and done, I expect him to be the best of the bunch. By alot."
"Yeah, that ball is named LaMelo"
"Honestly I feel like the people who thought he would fail either 1) never watched him play or 2) have never seriously played ball. The way he moves with the ball is effortless. Everything is instinctual when he is playing, even at the NBA level. He can get to wherever he wants on the floor and can get himself a good look at pretty much any time. You can teach shooting and get better at that, but the ball handling, where everything is spontaneous and instinctual, that LaMelo has is flat out special. Point is, fuck yall haters LaMelo good haha"
"Holy fuck the fact that this kid plays for us just blows my mind still  LaMelo Ball, youngest player to get a triple-double in NBA history, plays for the fucking Hornets."
"LaMelo ""Malachi Flynn"" Ball"
I like Lamelo Ball.
I think LaMelo Ball might be good
"Lamelo Ball is the World Best Professional Athlete, sources say"
"Lamelo is so smooth man. He doesn‚Äôt pound the air out the ball but he has the ball in his hands enough to make plays off the dribble and initiate offense, it‚Äôs like he knows exactly what the offense needs of him. He‚Äôs definitely a high IQ defender as well but his footwork and body need improvement for him to make a jump.   Watching this game convinced me. Dude is the real deal."
Lamelo Ball is my dad
Lamelo ‚Äúshake and bake‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drop a bitch‚Äù Ball
That‚Äôs Illawarra Hawks LaMelo Ball to you
LAMELO BALL=GOAT
lamelo ball
Sorry but Malachi Flynn &gt; Lamelo ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù Ball
I love Lamelo Ball
LaMelo Ball will be a superstar in a couple years
Happy for lamelo. I grew up in chino hills and graduated from chino hills high (a few years before the ball brothers were in attendance). Lamelo looking like he'll be the most successful so far coming out of chhs.
Is LaMelo Ball already a better prospect than Trae Young?
"so lamelo is the true superstar btwn the ball brothers, only a matter of time until the hornets franchise has to make that descsion"
It's honestly crazy how dead-on accurate the scouting of the Ball brothers was while they were still at Chino Hills. LaMelo was always thought to be better than Lonzo while LiAngelo wasn't really ever going to make it.
"You don‚Äôt have to play your five best players in the starting lineup.   There‚Äôs only one ball in the court, every team needs that guy that produces off the bench. LaMelo is that for Charlotte."
LaMelo Ball is going to win ROY
 LAMELO BALL. Big baller!
Lamelo Ball. My new favorite player after Bron
Lmao. We‚Äôre obviously gonna build around the Martwins. I‚Äôm just glad LaMelo has been increasing his trade value so we can get someone who won‚Äôt take the ball away from Cody and Caleb
"Best public high school team ever. Lonzo star at UCLA, Liangelo leading Cali in points, and Lamelo scoring 92 in a high school game. Loud father. Their own Facebook watch show. They may seem boring in interviews, but they are not in Ball in the family, their FB show. (IMO)."
"Hey guys, LaMelo assist at 1Q 42 second mark not counted. If you rewatch any stream, the announcers mention it as an assist as well.   I know you can‚Äôt see much here, here‚Äôs another angle where you can see Melo push the ball to Miles. (Second play)  https://imgur.com/a/LvyvWyh"
"Normally I'm one to say the same thing, that it's too early to call something with such a small sample size. That being said, LaMelo at first glance does seem to have certain skills that aren't likely to diminish or regress for a long time, in his ball handling, passing vision, and his ability to create space and facilitate.  It's like a high walk rate in baseball. Hitting (like shooting in basketball) can fluctuate with hot or cold streaks but a good eye at the plate is generally a skill that doesn't regress, unless a guy starts trying to do too much.  I have a feeling with LaMelo's skillset, at worst he'll be on NBA rosters for a very long time even if, at times, he doesn't score a whole lot."
"Lamelo has the potential to be a great player because of his superb playmaking ability and his flaws are definitely fixable, kid's got confidence with the ball on his hands. Lonzo seems to be improving and he could become a better defender and gain some confidence as a finisher. He'll never live up to the hype of his draft year but he'll be fine."
I rewatched and slowed it down. Bridges didn't have time for a normal shot. Lamelo was still holding the ball with 1 second left in the shot clock. Bridges caught the pass with just 0.5 remaining
Zion was sending that ball to Mars if Lamelo shoots it

"&gt; He wasn't open. williamson was on him.  if LaMelo shot the ball, he would have easily got it over Zion.  Zion was too far away"
Lonzos shot not even the worst thing about him. The fact that lonzo couldn‚Äôt make driving layups or hit free throws was much worse. Lamelo jumper also nowhere near as bad as lonzos where he pulled the ball across his whole body.
"It definitely was open, but you‚Äôre right about Terry. He wasted a solid two seconds with the ball before passing it to LaMelo."
"No no You don‚Äôt understand, that right there is the world‚Äôs biggest super fan of LaMelo Ball, ever since the night Lavar conceived LaMelo they‚Äôve been there rooting him on. You can‚Äôt imagine how long they‚Äôve been waiting for this day, so us band-wagon LaMelo posers just have to sit tf down I guess."
I would put Lamelo Ball and devin Vassell there instead of Wiseman and Pritchard
Lamelo is basically a cartoon character that can ball.   He was born n raised to be memed.
"JVG had a great point on the broadcast where he said when Lamelo drives he drives to finish whereas when Lonzo drives he drives to pass out.   Lonzo's never been a good rim finisher and it's honestly disappointing he hasn't figured that part of his game out yet, his vertical isnt bad but he keeps driving with the ball on his hip"
I like this list I saw from a pelicans fan better  1. Lamelo 2. Left ball 3. Right ball 4. Lonzo
Gordon Hayward is underpaid. Lamelo Ball was a steal at 3rd overall. I will not be taking questions at this time.
Conclusion: Lamelo ball isn't just Lonzo Ball
Anybody who watched Lamelo before he got in the league knew he would be better than his brother. Kid can legitimately Ball
"I mean the Pelicans had Lonzo sitting in the corner majority of the time and the Hornets ran a lot of sets that involved LaMelo with the ball. I‚Äôm not sure what you really expect.   LaMelo had a great game but Lonzo not getting his numbers isn‚Äôt all on him. Sure he had a couple turnovers and missed shots but it‚Äôs hard to get into a rhythm when you‚Äôre sent to the corner almost every play. Tonight, LaMelo had the ball a lot and was able to get into a rhythm."
Lamelo Ball is a top 10 PG
"Go ahead and take a look at the Jazz' roster and see which players are averaging double digit assists. The answer is none. The Jazz just doesn't get many high assist games out of their players because everyone is trained to make the extra pass to find an open look - that's why people love to call it the ""blender offense"" - most of our sets start with either dribble penetration and kickout, or a high pick and roll, Gobert's gravity as a roll-man to collapse the defense, then the  ballhandler passes it out to the open man, and the defense starts to scramble to compensate, then they kick the rock around the perimeter until they have a high-quality shot. [Just take a look at this film if you don't believe me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRwqm1-WhFw) and you'll notice a consistent patter; high screen into dribble penetration, go until you hit the paint, kick out, dribble penetration, kick out, dribble penetration, kick out, until you find a wide open three. It's why the Jazz are the best 3pt team in the NBA; it's not based around having one player break down the defense and make the right read, it's about everyone doing their part to get the defenders to scramble, the putting the ball in the right guy's hand.  In a system where every player is touching the ball, sometimes multiple times in a single possession, it's *really* hard to average a high assist count - raw assist count as a counting metric really privileges high-volume playmaking scorers who hold the ball in their hands a lot - guys like Harden, Luka, and LeBron, or guys who are purely pass-first playmakers who are not primary scorers like Simmons, Rondo, or LaMelo. Mitchell is not the second type of player - he's first and foremost a scorer. And Mitchell does not play in an offense that would facilitate him being the first type of player. The Jazz are not a star-led offense in the way that the Harden-era Rockets, the Lakers, or the Mavericks are."
lamelo ball
"I like Wiseman a lot, and you really can‚Äôt go wrong picking a unicorn centers with elite defensive potential .  However, I still think LaMelo would‚Äôve been a higher upside choice. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô6‚Äù and would be mentored by Curry, Klay and Dray. His passing would unlock the Warriors team beyond our imagination. It could‚Äôve been extremely destructive, and both Steph and Klay have no problem playing off the ball and dropping 30 each regardless."
Yikes. Hate to break it to you but Lamelo Ball isn't bringing any team to a Spurs-like dynasty.
"I thought and still think they should have picked LaMelo. Wiseman has great tools and has shown flashes but looks at least a year or two away from being an effective player. Clock is ticking for the Warriors, they don‚Äôt really have the time for a long development project at center. If you spent a good amount of time watching LaMelo in his various environments the last couple years there was zero reason to doubt what he is capable of. Lamelo Ball is Him. If they‚Äôre serious about making this team a Spurs like dynasty then I believe they missed. If Wiseman becomes Embiid then they‚Äôll have been right I just don‚Äôt see it as of now.  Team like the Warriors has a year from hell and gets the opportunity to pick a guy like LaMelo Ball and they don‚Äôt. They can talk up Wiseman all they want but they missed."
"You would think it'd be an obvious choice.  However the argument for ""best player available"" comes into play when you draft that high.  There are many who felt that not drafting Lamelo Ball was a bad choice for the dubs.  I, however, strongly believe that Wiseman was not only the better fit for us, but will be a better player for us."
"I think ball will be good, and if the season ended today he‚Äôd be ROTY, but ball certainly still has some rough edges just like wiseman. I will say Lamelo has given more defensive effort than I thought we‚Äôd see in year 1."
"Agree Wiseman is showing some flashes. I really hope his development keeps going at this pace as the Warriors are going to want to take that step back to contention next year. Curry only has so much time left.   Still would put Lamelo over him from a prospect level,  since a shot at a lead ball handler with that level of feel is just too valuable in the league right now. But you can't be mad at the Wiseman pick right now."
Not hands down. Honestly Lamelo Ball is the front-runner imo
"While you're right that there was no consensus #1, you're way underselling the LaMelo projections. A strong majority of reputable commentators had LaMelo pretty firmly at #1 (I think all of Givony, Vecenie, Ford, Duncan, Leroux, and Hollinger, if I'm not mistaken). All summer, podcast after podcast, it was ""LaMelo's gonna walk into the league as one of the NBA's best passers / playmakers."" All of these Globetrotters-ish highlights we're seeing were forecast by virtually everyone on the draft beat; the only mild surprise is that he is shooting slightly better than expected out of the gate and is trying harder on D than expected. He's mostly been as advertised, and most mock-draft podcast discussions that I recall (mostly the personalities above) said that MIN should take LaMelo, DLo overlap be damned (the argument being that while KAT is good enough for them to not consider drafting Wiseman, DLo is not good enough to bump LaMelo out of the conversation).  What I'll give you is that (I think according to Vecenie's surveying of his team contacts) Edwards was most consistently high in the rankings, meaning that virtually no one had him out of their top 3, whereas some teams really did want little to do with Ball or Wiseman. With the exception of Wiseman being way ahead of schedule on his jumpshooting and a few other random hotspots further down the draft (Maxey, Pritchard, etc.), the scouting reports and NBA projections for this class have so far been very accurate, from what I've seen. Very few have really popped or busted in unexpected ways yet."
Lamelo Ball was 6 years old the last time Lebron James scored less than 10 points in a regular season game.
"the Ball bros have broken shot mechanics  &amp;#x200B;  at least Lamelo has some dog in him, so that automatially makes him better than Lonzo"
"Its interesting bcuz I feel like OKC definitely had conversations with Minnesota for the #1 pick this year. There were a lot of reports that Presti was eyeing LaMelo Ball (we signed his brother to a G-league contract last year) and was tryna acquire a top-3 pick to draft him.  There's a good chance as well that Dort might have been on the table for the #1 pick (along with other stuff), but I think Wolves probably turned it down."
Lonzo will be out of the league after this year when his contract his over. This is nothing more than releasing his frustration cause everyone knows LaMelo is the better Ball brother and the Lakers won promptly after dumping him to NOLA
Terry Ball / LaMelo Rozier would actually be a crazy offensive talent
Lou Williams  Lamelo Ball  Lebron James  Larry Sanders  Lamar Odom  This is easily a better starting 5 than K's. ^(/s)
Tried to make a semi realistic cap situation with my list and take into account fit. Not in any particular order.   Luka Lavine Haliburton Patrick Williams Zion Jokic Giannis Dort Jarrett Allen Lamelo Ball
"This is super tough. I think Lamelo will be a star one day and def has a higher ceiling than Pat. The thing is Pat is impressing as a 4th or 5th option in starting lineup with minimal touches. Pat's ceiling certainly isn't Tatum-like scorer, but instead more of a smooth, patient Kawhi-like player who just knows how to play the game and can play both ends of the floor. Lamelo might be Trae Young minus the shooting - both guys are bad defenders and are inconsistent shooting the ball. If you draft Lamelo, you have to commit to him long term, and the question is if making him your #1 or #2 guy is worth it at his ceiling when you're paying him max money.   If you look at the final 4 playoff teams this past season (Lakers, Nuggets, Heat, Celtics), all of them had balanced teams with 1 or 2 primary scorers and facilitators. That being said, having an elite two-way wing who can give you 20 ppg and guard the other team's best player is more important than having 1 great playmaker who isn't super efficient and can't really play defense."
I would not sleep on Williams‚Äô ceiling though. Lamelo has the possibility to high usage ball handler. But 6‚Äô7‚Äù wing that can shoot it and create a bit is not a bad archetype either.

Wasnt lamelo always known as the better ball bro?
james wiseman = sam bowie  lamelo ball = michael jordan
"LaMelo Ball wins 6th man of the year, but not rookie of the year  Also LeBron and the Lakers bow out in the 2nd round of the playoffs to someone like Dallas or Denver"
"Lmao Ja has made countless impossible and insane passes, if he was Lamelo ball he'd have 5 passes on the front page."
"hornets don‚Äôt do anything special on defense with lamelo, he‚Äôs just got a great feel and super high iq so he knows what he can and can‚Äôt do defensively. They have used him as an off guard a lot but over time he‚Äôs shown that he‚Äôs a super high positive impact player and has earned more touches but really still is used off ball more than he should be"
"Genuinely wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing him in a role similar to CP3‚Äôs Thunder run - bunch of young dudes, some decent defence, some hustle guys. The biggest knock I‚Äôll put on him is that I‚Äôm not sure if his way of playing is championship conducive, but I think he‚Äôd be great next to some young guys who need mentoring and some players who can hit shots. He‚Äôs past his peak, but I still think he has a little bit left in the tank to will a team to the playoff in the right situation.  Somewhere like the Rockets would actually be interesting with him instead of Wall. I think NOLA also would be intriguing but might be to Ingram‚Äôs detriment a tad. An OKC return maybe, but once again, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the right fit next to Shai. None of those are contenders, but I think he raises the floor a fair bit and playoffs become a possibility in one or two of those scenarios.  But if you‚Äôre asking what stars he would pair well with? I think that‚Äôs tough because most stars need the ball and there aren‚Äôt a lot of non-Curry stars who work well off-ball (or at least want to). KD grew as a player with the Warriors and ironically I think would be as close to as good a fit as I can think of, but it‚Äôs still not a great fit and not with Harden now either. I don‚Äôt think you could count Hayward as a star, but that would be interesting - however I think Lamelo loses out there.   Truly I haven‚Äôt thought it overly through, but I still think there‚Äôs a place for Russ to shine for his remaining years in this league, I just think Beal is at the stage of his career where he needs more touches (and a way better supporting cast) and Russ is still insistent on being the main guy when he‚Äôs on the court. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ideal.   I would be highly intrigued to see a coach like Pop tackle Westbrook though! I genuinely don‚Äôt know if that would end in disaster or not, but he‚Äôs not had that type of coach (or that caliber) and that would be interesting to say the least!"
Unpopular opinion these days but I love where the jerseys have gone. Tons of them are fun to wear. I bought a LaMelo Ball Mint Jersey just because of how clean it is. I get it being disorienting on the court though.
This reminds me of that one play lamelo ball had while he played pro. It's insane how often Luka impresses the nba at such a young age.
Melo is LaMelo Ball. You meant to say Carmelo.

LaMelo Ball
"Coming in here late, but LaMelo Ball has one of the smoothest games in the NBA. I never watched him play before he got drafted, but his handles and passing since he joined the Hornets have been real nice to watch. He's always adding in no look passes for flare too.  Unfortunately his shooting form isn't great, but he's still an okay shooter."
"Larry Bird, Lebron James, Lamar Odom, Luka Doncic Lamelo Ball  98-0 Neva Lost"
"No, this is what I think LaMelo Ball sounds like in private though"
"I would maybe slow down with 6MOTY talk as handsome and good at basketball as he is. He certainly is climbing the ladder, especially as the Harden trade and related roster shakeups may pull a couple of guys out of bench roles, but I don‚Äôt know if it would be fair to say he‚Äôs been better than Jordan Clarkson, who is the top bench offense option for Utah and has been showing big effort and improvement on defense over the course of the season. Terrance Ross has been scoring well for a pesky Magic team. The Ball brother appeal (as goofy as it is) and ESPN‚Äôs unceasing boner for him make LaMelo a contender. I think ‚Äúlooking like a 6MOTY contender‚Äù would be a far fairer frame for this post."
A dude was saying that Lamelo Ball was the greatest passer of all time. It was preseason and he was dead serious.
Malachi Flynn &gt; Lamelo Ball
"adding 2 playmakers like LaMelo and Hayward helps. Also, when there‚Äôs not a ball dominant scorer on the team it usually leads to more ball movement"
"Zion, Lamelo ball, Doncic, LeBron, Curry, KD -&gt; National TV. Everyone else, get fucked.   - Disney/Turner probably."

"Oii what about Lamelo Ball, mate?"
"relative to expectations yes but in the grade scheme of things no. Lots of these guys are high floor/low ceiling types. So like Tyrese Haliburton, LaMelo Ball, and even James Wiseman are all guys who will realistically peak at a sub-all star level."
"I am going to say Wiseman.  His physical frame looks like he should fill out nicely for a big and he can already shoot the 3.  His handles might not be guard level, but he can still handle the ball.  I would even still call him a raw talent.  He could have a AD or Embid like career.  LaMelo has the handles and the flash, but the guard position is so deep in the NBA.  As a guard he will need to refine a lot of skills to become a top guard in the league.    One last piece I believe will help Wiseman is he is on the GSW and LaMelo is on the Hornets.  I just trust the GSW to develop Wiseman more than I believe in Charlotte.  Both should end up to be really good I give a slight edge to Wiseman"
I am not an architect but It seems the ball family home has a ceiling of around 30ft in some areas. I don't know about Weisman's home but with the information I have available gotta go with lamelo.
"Hey people. I'm not a *new* NBA fan per se but have recently renewed my interest in the league and the sport as a whole. Help me find a team?   I kinda like the Raptors (Canadian godfather), the Bulls (loved MJ as a kid and later DRose), the Nuggets, the Jazz, the Sixers, and boy is that kid LaMelo fun to watch.   I'm pretty much open to any team good or bad, but I like team basketball with sweet passes rather than iso ball. I also like rooting for fun personalities and good people.   Another thing is, I'm a baseball fan as well and facing a similar sort of dilemma there. I'm not from the US or Canada so maybe having my favorite teams in the same city could be helpful if I ever decide to visit.

"... no man... the point is that Wiseman and Ball were selected because of who they **could be** as Nba players. Over the course of an Nba career. And we will only know the successes and failures of those careers after their careers are done  You inexplicably seem to be thinking of this as a binary 'Lamelo Ball was seen as the better player, so he should have been chosen' when the actual thought process should be about **MARGINAL UTILITY**. Wiseman, who has played only about a dozen games since high school, has a very very good chance to be better than Ball, who played against grown men in a professional league. This potential will manifest over the course of a career, not immediately. Don't know why I have to belabor that obvious point.  Repeating the phrase ""outcome-oriented decision"" does not reify it into a meaningful concept. What the hell would a ""non-outcome-oriented decision"" even look like? You talk like you're trying to say one line of thought, namely picking BPA, is better than another, but you keep talking about the ""decision"" itself for some reason. A decision can only be made in pursuit of a goal (winning basketball games or championships, a player having a consequential career, etc ), and within the confines of a linear timeline  You're not making an argument here for anything, you're just hoisting up one line of thought as 'correct' and obtusely ignoring the validity of any other lines of reasoning. Even the most **minor** of differences  That's why your 'analogy' doesn't make any sense, if you're using it as a way to say that things can work out for you despite your justifications being spurious, then it's clear you're arguing about the validity of lines of thought, rather than anything to do with how a ""decision"" would pan out. And that's a completely different argument. That you've made no points for at all.... besides this convoluted and irrelevant analogy.  You should look up what a ""Justified True Belief"" is and what the ""Gettier Problem"" is. They are infinitely closer to what you're trying to talk about than this unrelated math problem you keep misapplying with increasingly brute stubbornness.  To return to the original point, the information they had was used in the process of determining who *will have* the better career. You see the future tense there??? That's the relevant part. Perhaps a better way for you to realize what's going on is to think of this as Wiseman *actually* being the true BPA, just that it will take more time for him to manifest as such, and that there are more potential risks along the way. And that different people may assign greater or lower chances to those risks actually happening."
Lamelo ball
"This is just not true. Pretty much every smart nba person worth their salt all say that point guard is the hardest position to learn in the league and that centers are the most nba ready coming out of college/overseas.   Also just thinking about the elite skills needed to be a competent point guard (agility, playmaking, ball handing, and bbiq to manage an offense) compared to a big (touch and size which most bigs have size by the nature of the position), and it‚Äôs easy to recognize that to be a competent guard in nba you are going to need more time to develop and read the game. This is pretty much the consensus throughout basketball, especially nba basketball.   Defend your guy but please don‚Äôt make shit up for the sake of trying to elevate one player while downplaying the talent of the other. Of course it makes more sense that Lamelo is more league ready, but also remember he played a total of 9 games more than Wiseman in the NBL, and was summarily shit talked for a year bc his stats were bad and ppl in this very sub said the NCAA is harder than the NBL (not kidding).   Both Lamelo and Wiseman are young and talented and have a bit to go before we see what players they will really be. We don‚Äôt have to shit talk either one of them to recognize that they can develop into amazing players."
"Lamelo Ball is listed at 6 foot 8. Chris Boucher is listed at 6 foot 9.  His last game against Portland. He had 3 blocks. One on Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Jones Jr. none of whom are 5"" shorter.  The last block he had on anyone more than 5"" shorter than him was his last block in Golden State on Steph Curry."
"&gt; Yes 6‚Äô8 point guards who make the passes lamelo does just grow on trees  Passing on its own has limited utility, no matter how good or flashy it is, unless it's paired with scoring. It doesn't really matter how good a PG's passing is if the other 4 guys you're passing to aren't open, because the defense is happy to let the PG attempt to score 1 on 1.   We've seen this with guys like Rubio. Rubio is a comparable passer to guys like Nash or CP3. Rubio is also taller than either, but his lack of a scoring threat reduces the value of his passing. He can't draw multiple defenders, which means all the guys he could potentially pass to are less open, and in less of a position to do anything if Rubio does get the ball to them.   As a result, you have a guy like Dame whose passing ends up equally valuable to Rubio's, even though Rubio is a much better pure passer than Dame. Because defenses have to double and help against Dame's scoring threat, Dame's teammates are more open. Dame isn't as good a passer, but he doesn't have to be, because his scoring threat allows him to be an equally effective passer while throwing easier passes.  So 6-6 PGs who can't shoot aren't that valuable, no matter how good they are at passing, because defenses will be happy to let them try to score with their 49.8% TS (weird that you brought up TS% as some kinda Lamelo support, when his is worse than Wiseman's).   Granted, Lamelo can probably improve. But your post kinda suggests that Wiseman will never improve, so fair is fair - treat both guys as if they'll never improve from what they are today. And today, Lamelo is a non-threat to score efficiently."
lamelo ball is a showtime damn that was nasty from both of them
LaMelo Ball jerseys are going to fly
Malachi Flynn Revenge SZN üòàüòàüòà Lamelo ‚Äú22/11/12‚Äù Ball who??
Lamelo increases the tempo much more than Wiseman could ever hope because of his ability to get the ball and start a fast break with his passing
Klay's only out for one season.  LaMelo would be coming off the bench because 1-4 in the starting lineup is already filled and you don't play small ball all the time - the Rockets showed why that's a bad idea.
Dante Exum was a failed version of Lonzo Ball before Lonzo Ball was a failed version of Lamelo Ball
https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/lamelo-ball-shot-chart
"He just doesn't really know how to play right now is the way I would describe it. He is a massive person with ridiculous athleticism but hasn't been able to harness it other than the occasional highlight play. As of now he has horrible shot selection, and really clumsy hands catching interior passes and rebounds. He can't defend without fouling at the moment, he doesn't move his feet and just swats at people, which makes sense, the last time he played real organized basketball was in HS when he probably had a foot and 30 pounds on every player and was good enough to just swat at people and take the ball.  That being said the people writing him off and saying Lamelo was the obvious choice are a little unfair. I still see wiseman turning into a great center"
Lamelo played pro ball overseas whereas wiseman played like 4 college games. Both can be great... why are people rushing both when its been like 10 regular season games in a weird season? Give it at least till the end of the season.
I'm confused. Wiseman looks like he is going to be really good. Wiseman didn't even get to play college games whereas LaMelo has played pro-level ball for years now. Of course LaMelo is going to be better out the gate.
LaMelo Ball
He can pass the ball to Lamelo so Lamelo can do a fancy pass to someone who can score. Not bad.  ü§î
"LaMelo A. Ball, the A stands for Air"
The nets saw LaMelo Ball and knew they had to get some help
"It‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs playing more, Ball has played 3 less minutes a game so far but averages a lot higher usage.  He looks like the ‚Äúbest‚Äù because he‚Äôs been shooting lights out.  I don‚Äôt expect him to keep his average 52/50/82 going tho his entire career lol.  I still think Lamelo is better though because he‚Äôs shown flashes of being a star so far."
"Putting his nice start in the league aside, is it just me or was there a narrative out there predraft that LaMelo would have been a poor stylistic fit on the Warriors? I seem to remember reading and hearing a lot of that and thought it made no sense.   When you have a guard like Steph, who is so good on and off ball, you can absolutely put another creator like LaMelo in the back court with him. There is no real ""bad fit"" in a backcourt with Steph Curry. Now Wiseman wasn't a bad pick either, he looks totally fine, but LaMelo would have made sense there too."
"You watch much? They both show some pretty incredible potential. Ant with his surprising vision, great speed with the ball, and ease of getting to the rim has been great to watch. His first step is insane. Wiseman has been a lot of fun too, super lengthy and can dunk like it‚Äôs nothing. Unless the league starts to shift big I expect wiseman to have a lot of success going forward. Lamelo looks really good but his BBIQ and basketball experience probably would‚Äôve had me guessing he‚Äôd look the best right out the gate. Also, they aren‚Äôt hiding Ant on defense that much like they are lamelo so it‚Äôs just a rockier start but I‚Äôm so much more confident in him now than when we drafted him"
"They need offense too and LaMelo can help with that.  LaMelo would have been a great fit with them, I agree with Jackson.  Look ahead passes in transition, big PG that could play with Steph, Golden State would help ensure he develops well since he would join an offense based on player movement and ball movement.  Wiseman is fine, could be a nice trade asset or quality starter for them, but you can get solid starting centers for relatively cheap, it is rough to use a high lotto pick on a center without some transcendent qualities.  Ball has so much more upside and he won't be a rookie forever."

"Ingram : he's been good enoug defensively this season unlike last year, and the offensive difference is huge, you can probably build a team that would be great with Simmons, but it would require very specific piece  Jokic : right now, Luka will be better, possibly even the at the end of this season  Booker : Even if Trae played hard on defense, his size would always be a problem, if Lamelo Ball can target him, any good offensive player will do the same in the playoffs, Booker has gotten better defensively, and offensively he's more versatile  AD : just better, more versatile, can fit everywhere, can play 2 positions, can be elite on and off ball defensively  Sabonis : not a fan of both, both have limitations that makes it hard to build a real contender around, but Sabonis gives more than scoring  Jrue : amazing defensively, can score, can pass, if CJ continues to shoot the 3 like that tho..."
"First of all, why the hell are you choosing the ball brothers? Lol  Secondly, no I doubt he's stay. He'd see two young guys, one of which is a rookie, that probably wouldn't be ready to contend for a title until he was in his mid-late thirties.   Lastly, how the hell would they get Lamelo on his own, let alone also trading for Ball? What are they giving up that's worth the 3rd overall pick?"
Lamelo ball. He has shown flashes but I truly believe he can be a top 10 player asap if they give him the chance.
You underestimate the pull of a rookie LaMelo Ball involved in the Finals. LaVar‚Äôs interviews alone would set TV records lol.
"I'm about to get downvoted for good reason but I'm taking LaMelo Ball and taking Brad Stevens as the coach.   Unlike with Luka, LaMelo and the number 1 pick in the following draft will still be bad enough to potentially get me Emoni Bates in the folowing draft.  I'll build around LaMelo, Emoni and Jaylen Green"
"Andrew Bogut also had NCAA and NBA experience **before** playing in the NBL but I guess that doesn't matter yeah?   You think the NBL is a bush league, Australia is the #3 team in the world according to FIBA.   LaMelo Ball had a radical development compared to most prospects yet he still is performing consistently across leagues.   And anyone with an eye can actually see that LaMelo is a much better offensive prospect than Lonzo, he's actually does drive to the hoop and tries to finish compared to Lonzo sometimes settling for bad shots on the perimeter instead of driving.   &gt;Another factor is they are both 2nd draft in their own draft class.  Zo is 2nd and Melo was 3rd."
LaMelo has always been the confident (to the point of over confident) Ball brother. He probably suffers less second guessing his decisions which allows his talent to shine.
"Oh I wasn‚Äôt even counting Rozier. In my eyes it‚Äôs Hayward, Graham/Ball, Ball/Graham and then Rozier. I wasn‚Äôt even considering Terry. So if Graham is consensus #2. Give me Lamelo. I‚Äôm taking a swing on potential there"
LaMelo definitely looks like he‚Äôs going to be the best ball brother

Unpopular Opinion: Lamelo Ball.
"Lamelo Ball might be the most confident player in the league lol, definitely the most confident rookie"
Lamelo is for sure the best ball brother...
Melo refers to LaMelo Ball now
"I'm not,all I'm saying is you're only looking at the negatives,what did you expect?This post is literally a pro lamelo ball dedicated post.He had a good night overall.""I'm not hyping up an player who shot 2-13"" felt really suggestive,it's 3/13 btw."
Love it. Fuck the haters these guys can ball. Edwards has seriously crazy athleticism and Lamelo already has crazy IQ
"""Air Ball"" sounds more like Giannis than LaMelo."
I overheard a guy saying Lamelo Ball was gonna be ROTY. Did Immanuel Quickeley retire already?
So many possessions where Lamelo doesn't touch the ball.
"LaMelo ""Airbnb now accepts reservations"" Ball."
"""If you were the Hornets, would you trade LaMelo Ball for--""  *no*"
"LaMelo ""Literally Zion"" Ball"
"I hope Lamelo is in perineal MVP contension, so we can hear Lavar Ball for the next decade and a half."
"&gt;Both need the ball in their hands, and Lamelo wasn‚Äôt projected to be a great defender or shooter so it‚Äôs not like he can spot up and let DLo take the ball handling duties either  Lamelo had good catch and shoot numbers. The idea that he couldnt play off the ball has already been shown to be overblown. Hes better on ball but that doesnt mean he cant play off it."
"He complements KAT but no way he complements DLo. Both need the ball in their hands, and Lamelo wasn‚Äôt projected to be a great defender or shooter so it‚Äôs not like he can spot up and let DLo take the ball handling duties either"
pretty hard for me to freak out about lamelo when doncic was a rookie literally 3 years ago  and lamelo ball is no luka doncic
"Russ in his prime without great passing is not a bad player. He was still dropping 30 on solid efficiency.   He could be more than a good driver. For a guard He has elite size and athleticism and finishing around the rim.   Edwards high end potential is an elite driver, competent playmaker, good shooter, great defender. I don‚Äôt think lamelos potential matches that.   It‚Äôs an opinion either way, but I think it‚Äôs entirely unjustified to say the wolves made a mistake based on 20 games when lamelo has already been playing professional ball."
"good job ignoring the 7 other positions i mentioned to focus on wiggins driving. Yes Lamelo is better than wiseman. But i question whether the dubs would benefit more from another ball dominant, poor defense guard over a big. And the CENTER is a dying position but a BIG MAN certainly is not."
"The amount of people saying Wiseman or Edwards have a higher ceiling then Melo is astounding. Lamelo is a big ball handling wing, that‚Äôs literally about as valuable as you can get in the modern NBA."
"&gt;I don't really care what the Wolves wanted man - their FO hasn't exactly shown much ability to build a good team  I mean since Rosas has took over he brought in Beasley and D'lo and the only reason we are a dumpsterfire is becuase KAT has been injured a lot.  &gt;LaMelo wasn't expected to be solid this quickly, but his profile is perfect for playing with Towns and he can make it work with DLo too - he can easily be an off ball secondary playmaker.  You've obviously haven't watched KAT play ever then. His game is perfect with cutters and slashers who can drive to the rim because he makes the opposing big man leave the paint and guard him at the 3 point line. Edwards is a perfect teammate for that."
"Those guys you compared him to are miles better as shooters lol. That‚Äôs like me comparing Edwards to Lebron because he‚Äôs got crazy athleticism.   I Believe Edwards can improve as a passer. Giannis, Kawhi, Durant, Beal, Kyrie all weren‚Äôt typical pass first guys but improved over time. Edwards is way more raw than LaMelo because LaMelo was playing pro ball while Edwards was on an awful college team.   Edwards over the last 9 games is averaging 17-4-3 on 45-40-80 splits."
"I don't really care what the Wolves wanted man - their FO hasn't exactly shown much ability to build a good team  LaMelo wasn't expected to be solid this quickly, but his profile is perfect for playing with Towns and he can make it work with DLo too - he can easily be an off ball secondary playmaker."
A ton of analysts viewed Wiseman or Anthony Edwards as the #1 also.  https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-draft-2020-mock-draft--who-will-be-the-no-1-overall-pick-anthony-edwards-lamelo-ball-james-wiseman/fzjr07j7twd5190ibt14yhz4g
"Because Lamelo is a great ball handler with truly elite passing vision - there's nothing I'd rather my guard be able to do than shoot off the dribble and be an elite playmaker.    It's the mold of literally every elite guard in the NBA right now - Steph, Lillard, Harden, etc.   How many of the leagues elite guards are mediocre playmakers? It's literally just Kyrie, and he's well beyond where Edwards is in that regard (and obviously is an elite scorer). I can't think of a single start guard with a similar game to Edwards. Maybe Beal?"
"Lonzo being the best out of the Ball brothers, being drafted 2nd, then struggling in the NBA kept LaMelo humble and made him work.  &amp;#x200B;  Do I need to explain further?"
It‚Äôs weird how lamelo is 6 8 and Steph plays phenomenal off ball and it‚Äôs 2021 yet you‚Äôre still arguing this was smart
"If you didn‚Äôt draft lamelo because of Deangelo Russell, you are an incredibly incompetent organization.  Also ball can easily play with curry"

"There's no way the Warriors are happier with Wiseman than Lamelo right now.  Edit; there's plenty of minutes for him, it's not like Wanamaker and Bazemore are immovable in the rotation. Curry doesn't need the ball in his hands but the Warriors do need another playmaker  Even when Klay comes back, Klay doesn't need the ball in his hands either which is why Iguodala handled the rock so much when he was there. Lamelo fills that role (but bigger) on offense"
LaMelo Ball and Gordon Hayward
I think if you multiply the entire left side of the equation by 10 then you get Lamelo Ball
Jordan skill + Magic passing + Steph shooting + Ibaka dick size = LaMelo Ball
Anthony Edwards over LaMelo Ball will eventually be part of that to some extent
I'm not claiming that I'm smarter than these GMs at all... I'm one of those fools who believed Wiseman was a better prospect than LaMelo and I was wrong. Dead wrong.   The lesson we can learn from the Suns and Warriors' mistakes is that you should ALWAYS take the perimeter ball-handler that's an elite passer over the center in THIS era of the NBA where a big is less valuable than somebody who can run your offense.
[LaMelo ball highlights custom made ](https://youtu.be/yMdDNkPJvWM)
Why does everyone think that LeBron is better than LaMelo Ball?
"Your original point had you including Wiggins in with the Big 3 as far as core pieces go, first off, that's an insult to the other 3 who are all legends of the game, but secondly, my point was that while he's serving his role well, he's not a core piece, the Warriors only have 3 core pieces: Steph/Klay/Draymond, everybody else could be moved tomorrow for the right offer. Not dissimilar in how the Spurs always had Duncan/Ginobili/Parker and constantly tinkered the rest of the roster around them.   And secondly, there's no reason as to why LaMelo couldn't function with this current Warriors team. Instantaneously he could've come in and fulfilled the Iguodala role on offense as a ball-handler and initiator.  When Klay comes back, you could've had something similar to the OG Death Lineup on offense:  Steph/Klay/Melo (as new Iggy)/Wiggins (as new Barnes)/Draymond"
"&gt; Wiseman was labeled a better prospect before the draft too.  By who? Mike Schmitz, Jonathan Givony, basically everybody who run ESPN's draft coverage all had Melo as their #1 prospect. I was skeptical at the time because he seemed to be an empty stats player in Australia, but I didn't follow him until I watched him in the NBA. You seem to be ignoring the point that I was in favor of the Wiseman pick for the Warriors at first and a LaMelo skeptic and I've changed my mind because I have to acknowledge the fact that he's been a positive impact player as a rookie, and rookies are seldomly ever positive impact players, and the ones who are, are usually special players that go onto become stars.    &gt; Not to mention Melo needs the ball in his hands which dray and curry handle those duties   I mean, you said it yourself, you can never have enough ball handlers. Melo would've filled the Iguodala role instantaneously.   If anything, having Melo could've allowed them to reconstruct something similar to their OG Death Lineup, at least on offense:  Steph/Klay/Melo as new Iggy/Wiggins as new Barnes/Dray"
You seem stubborn on this but you are using hindsight without context. I'm just telling you the rationale that the FO had when selecting wiseman. Wiseman was labeled a better prospect before the draft too. So you really are blaming irrelevant conversations. Not to mention Melo needs the ball in his hands which dray and curry handle those duties. Whjle you are right that you can never have enough ball handlers but you aren't picking him unless you are giving him the keys to the franchise which curry is gonna be the focal point for the franchise for the next 5 years. It worked out better for lamelo as he has his own sjtuatjon to grow in.
"Because Wiseman was a better player and better prospect. Because drafting a player who is projected as someone who is best running the offense when you already have Steph Curry doesn't make sense. LaMelo isn't an off-ball guard, and turning Steph into that would be a crime against humanity.  This isn't a Bowie-over-MJ, fit-over-BPA situation; this is a better fit separating two players who, at their closest and most generous to LaMelo, projected to be about equal."
"Why could they be so much better with LaMelo?  If Wiseman ends up being what the Warriors hope, he'd be a defensive anchor who can handle the ball and score at all levels.  LaMelo is certainly more NBA-ready, which I can understand is useful for the Warriors' aging stars, though."
"&gt;The suggestion of a lineup with Dray at C, with LaMelo in it? That sounds fucking awful.  Right? Kerr would not go for it, people forget that the small ball death lineup only works when it's used in the right moments and efficiently. We know this because of times like losing Bogut or other times we've been forced to go small ball. The Death line up is great for huge runs but it is not sustainable. Hell I thought even Kerr said this last week."
"It's similar in the sense that both teams went for the big man over the perimeter ball handler who can run your offense, when it's been proven that in 2021 the latter is more valuable than the former.   Look, I was a LaMelo skeptic too, I didn't have any problem with them taking Wiseman over LaMelo at the time, but I've changed my mind after watching LaMelo play in the NBA, he's an amazing passer who knows how to run an offense and he's a MUCH better shooter than I thought he was.   The one fear I have over LaMelo is how much will he actually improve. In that aspect, he reminds me of Ben Simmons, who came into the league and was immediately good, and hasn't really gotten better since then.   Wiseman might end up being better than LaMelo down the line seeing as he's the type of player who is going to take a while to develop given how hard it is to be a modern day big (Ayton is still inconsistent in Year 3), but by the time Wiseman reaches his potential, Steph and Klay will be in their late 30s, whereas LaMelo is going to be better than Wiseman for the rest of Steph's prime."
"Nah, this an awful take. He has huge value for us on the defensive end and he's starting to get acclimated to being efficient in our system. If you've watched any Warriors games attentively it's obvious he is the second best player all around out there most nights. The only knock is his contract is high.   And we didn't ""pass on a potentially elite prospect"". We still drafted a potentially elite prospect. Remember we drafted who we were expected to draft and we still had the #2 overall pick. Acting like we made some huge mistake by not drafting LaMelo ball is revisionist and short sighted given that we're not even halfway through Wiseman's rookie season.   And sorry, but a line up of Steph - Klay - Dray - Wiggins - and a more developed Wiseman sounds pretty damn good to me."
"Lamelo ball wasnt projected to go number 2, the warrior needed a more nba ready player and that was Wiseman. The warriors already had a pg in curry and lamelo ball shouldn't be played as a wing he has the size but hes best utilized as a pg. Also the warriors were in deep need of a center james Wiseman filled that role."
Na it's not the same story. Luka had achieved way more than Ayton had in Europe while Lamelo was an inefficient non defensive ball dominant guard. How is it similar?  This almost feels like a Tyreke Evans/Steph situation or when MCW was by far the best player in is draft and a superstar day 1 while Giannis nobody. It's just been 25 games anything can happen
"He's also 363rd in BPM, 303rd in WS/48, and 420th by VORP. It doesn't really matter how you slice it; most advanced stats don't reflect kindly on Wiseman's play so far this year.  That's fine; most rookies struggle, and it's entirely possible that Wiseman turns out to be a great player. I thought he would show more defensively than he has, the way Rudy Gobert did in his rookie season.   The only reason this looks bad (which also applies to the Timberwolves) is because they passed up on LaMelo Ball for fit reasons despite the reporting that they thought he was the best prospect in the draft.   Both teams would love to have LaMelo at the moment, not even for developmental upside (which he does have), but because he's contributing at a starting level right now!   For the Timberwolves it's even worse because LaMelo is playing better than D'Lo, who is the whole reason they didn't draft LaMelo."
Sooo.... you telling me Lamelo ball doesn't have more votes than Fred Van Fleet? I find that hard to believe.
"Wiseman barely played in college. Basically went from HS to the NBA. The fact he has one less year of experience, much less at a pro level, than LaMelo and is still performing well speaks of his potential no?  Klay got injured but he's expected to be back next year. Wiseman was a better fit. LaMelo from his NBL take would not have been a better fit next to steph given how ball dominant he was and his inconsistent shooting.   Easy to look back now when he's been hitting shots and say he would been a better fit, but by the same measure Haliburton would have been a good fit too since he's slotted as a 2 guard now in SAC."
What‚Äôs so shocking is how well he is scoring. I liked Lamelo and was watching a lot of his nbl tape and knew his passing was as good as advertised. However his scoring was a serious concern of mine. He‚Äôs shooting better than I thought from 3 and still finds ways to score when his 3 ball isn‚Äôt falling. He‚Äôs already had some impressive finishes at the rim. Teams are gonna regret not trading up for him in a draft where the teams with the top 2 picks were practically begging someone to trade up.
&gt; thanks to the star power of the rookie LaMelo Ball and the shotmaking of Gordon Hayward  &gt; Here's how they're doing it  Sounds like they answered the question before they asked it.
"You just gave a great example... That Duke team with Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish, Barrett, and Tre Jones couldn't compete with a top Euro-league team? I'm not talking about Euro League Team featuring Gasol or an extreme outlier in Luka.  Remember LaMelo Ball with his ragtag group was playing 2nd Div in Lithuania.  They were doing just fine. Yea they struggled against 1st division competition.  But it wasn't to the level of being non-competitive.  I literally gave you instance of 4 teams 2012 UK, 1998 UK, 2001 Duke, you can throw in 1999 UConn. Then you have 2009 UNC,2007 Florida that were college teams loaded with above-average NBA talent, and were above average as soon at they took the floor the following year. Thats 6 teams in 22 years that just won the NCAA Championship.  That excludes Teams like Zion's Duke Team, or Wall/Cousin's UK Team, or the UCLA Team with Love, Westbrook, Memphis who had D-Rose, CDR, and Joey Dorsey who didn't win the title.  You are trying to argue, that a team who's BEST player is at best a rotational player in the NBA can beat a college team with multiple players who are capable of being rotational players or starters.  Look at those roster's of the teams I provided, and look what they did in their NBA careers within 3 years of being in the NBA.  Now overlay that Euroleague Teams and their Rosters.  I personally wouldn't bet my life savings on that game.  I'm saying I wouldn't take a bet on who would win that game.  Because I know how 'high-end' talent works in the Basketball.  Its not that crazy.  Its no different than saying a top 4x400 USA College Team could make the an Olympic Finals or WC Finals.  Now its very easy to measure because we have a stop watch.  Why is it possible? Because again, they may have 3 guys who are 'Good' who can run low 46s and high 45s.  But they prob all have a absolute workhorse Michael Norman who can compete individually on the world stage. Running 44s and lower."
"It has to be someone beyond just good, in that they elevate the entire team.  I‚Äôm thinking Jimmie Butler, LeBron, Jordan.   Like that doesn‚Äôt happen every year.  Even superstars lose a bit of fire from year to year.  So it has to be a player dominating statistically AND elevating his team in the same year.  See Westbrook for an example of a dominant player statistically for a few years but not really elevating the team (he was the offense out of necessity).    AND the team has to be winning and competing to make a run at the playoffs.    So for me this year -   Greek Freak  Jokic  It‚Äôs scary that I would almost list LaMelo Ball here but.. Trey Young trending right direction   Beal is great but team  Curry dependent on how good the team can be  Davis is a consideration  Jerami Grant is just amazing this year  Doncic needs more wins   Anyway that‚Äôs just random thoughts.  I know I‚Äôm forgetting people but just thinking of players I‚Äôve watched this year and went ‚Äúwow that guy is on the next level and elevating his team‚Äù"

"First Team: Lamelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Immanuel Quickley, Patrick Williams, James Wiseman   Second Team: Cole Anthony, Desmond Bane, Anthony Edwards, Devin Vassell, Jae'Sean Tate"
LaMelo Ball played five (5) minutes in the second half.  What the fuck is James Borrego doing with this team.
Trae Young and Lamelo Ball are just further examples of why scoring in today's league doesn't mean much anymore
LaMelo Ball
Don‚Äôt fucking call it slavery if you know it‚Äôs not then. That‚Äôs misleading and stupid. There are people that make it and there are people that don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs reality. Is it unfair? Yes. Not everyone is going to succeed. Most college athletes don‚Äôt become pros. And your anger in the NCAA is misplaced. It‚Äôs not the NCAA that decided on a age limit for the draft it‚Äôs the NBA. You‚Äôre one of those people that believe these players are forced to go to college when they can just go to Europe or anywhere right away like a Lamelo Ball. He‚Äôs doing just fine. You‚Äôre not well informed in this
Melo = Camelo  Melo ball = Lamelo
why would you get confused? Melo is Carmelo Anthony and Lamelo is Lamelo Ball
LaMelo Ball
"LaMelo, from what I read, isn‚Äôt good defensively. And let‚Äôs no act like he‚Äôs a massive step up from oubre shooting wise. He‚Äôs shooting like 32% from three. Which is below where oubre has been for weeks now. LaMelo off the bench running point would be a god send for the warriors, but playing off ball next to curry? Nah not a huge upgrade."
"Lmao bruh he‚Äôs 19 and only played in high school really. LaMelo played professionally against adults. Any idiot could‚Äôve told you LaMelo would be more polished. Holy hot takes in this thread. LaMelo is clearly playing better, especially since he‚Äôs been starting. But wiseman has played in 20 games, has had several 20 point games. Can knock down 3‚Äôs at a good clip. Can handle the ball."
LaMelo Ball says hello
"Maybe LaMelo is doing better because, ya know, he‚Äôs a better player?? The ball family always said LaMelo is the best of the three brothers, so you would expect him to perform better in his rookie year than Lonzo which he (not surprisingly) has"
Melo = Carmelo Anthony  Zo = Alonzo Mourning  LaMelo = LaMelo Ball  Lonzo = Lonzo Ball  End of discussion. No opinions. Only data.
"I hope for the best for him, and he‚Äôs still only 16, but I think it‚Äôs unlikely he actually plays in the NBA. He has to be one of the most overrated recruits in HS basketball history. He is only 6‚Äô2‚Äù, and has averaged 6 ppg so far in high school yet is ranked in the top 20 in his class. His AAU success has been against kids his own age, instead of playing in the oldest age bracket like every other underclassmen star player does.  Yes he is at a powerhouse school, he has only played in a handful of games, he has amazing feel for the game &amp; instincts, and he could still grow a few more inches... but I just don‚Äôt see it. Most NBA players dominate in HS from a young age. Lamelo Ball averaged 17-4 for the national championship team as a freshman when he had braces and was like 5‚Äô9‚Äù."
Or you get lucky and get a Luka..Ja Morant..shit even LaMelo Ball.  Not every rookie needs the multiple years to develop.  I can understand the Bulls hesitation given their recent picks slowly developing (or not at all).   Unless the Bulls are getting a top FA why waste Lavine prime and also stay in mediocre land.   Raps are playing average and they are talking about trading Lowry ..
"Lamelo is best served by reliable shooters. Terry rozier and Malik monk are both better shooters than lonzo ball this season. Plus, if we're gonna trade for someone, the position we least need to trade for is a point guard.   Maybe we can sign lonzo in 5-7 years in order to make lamelo happy and keep him in Charlotte if he becomes an MVP caliber player. But for now, let's worry about winning."

"I know what set point is.  Curry shoots around eye level  not from the top of his head , Young has an even lower set point right at face level .  Lamelo shoots as from a similar set point as Young .  Like i said with the examples ,lower set point does not mean easier to block.  Text book form does not exist rather the jumpshot is constantly evolving ,with the emphasis on deep shooting a faster more fluid power transfer and release is much better than putting the ball high over your  head .  Some of the so called text book form tips are also just plain wrong like keeping you shoulders squared which is against the natural body movement and no top shooter does it .  But these kind of fake text book principles still fuck up freethrows for a lot of players . Lebron for example would probably shoot better immediately if he angled his feet to the left on free throws . Something he naturally does like almost every other player while shooting jump shots ."
"I should probably clarify that by release point I mean not only where your hand finishes at the end of the shot, but also where your ‚Äúset point‚Äù is, at the start of your shot.  Textbook form is to have your shooting elbow below the ball, and the ball up around the top of your head, at the start of your shooting motion.  Curry does this.  Lamelo has his shooting elbow angled out to the side, and the ball starts from around his chest/chin.  This makes his shot easier to block/bother, and harder for him to get a good shot off with a defender on him.  FWIW he used to do this worse than he does today, his form overall is significantly improved.  Could still get a lot better, though."
"perhaps you're thinking of the other ball brother, Lamelo has always had the most hype"
You‚Äôve watched every single Lamelo ball game for 5 years? Hahahahahaha bro no you didn‚Äôt
"I‚Äôve been saying the jury is still out on the Hornets FO. Word around the street is that MJ isn‚Äôt taking the Hornets seriously (more concerned with the 200 mil he lost in the GME thing atm) , which worries me a lot . Mitch Kupchak doesn‚Äôt inspire so much trust , and I don‚Äôt think the Hornets expected Lamelo to be this good this early just like everyone else    Ideally you want a big guard to pair with Lamelo in the backcourt of the future , and get a young center to grow and develop with the team (Vernon Carey and Nick Richards are developing in the G league rn, Biyombo and Zeller simply wont cut it so I hope they develop into something special)  A young wing would also be nice , since Hayward is going to be more injury prone the older he gets . So Big Guard - Lamelo - Bridges - 2 way Wing - Above average Center   As a fan of the Ball family I‚Äôd love it if Lonzo went to Charlotte but I don‚Äôt think the Hornets want to give Lavar more power lmao   There‚Äôs a lot of politics but I hope things work out for the better"
"Typically, guards aren‚Äôt the best positional choice for a championship contending team. Lamelo is young, so it would be unfair for me the nitpick a lot of things about his game right now. Let me just say that if he can:  1. Improve his on ball defense 2. Finish at the rim, through contact etc. 3. Flesh out his build (again, I know he‚Äôs young and it‚Äôll come)  Then he‚Äôs got a shot. He‚Äôs long, athletic, and has the confidence and frame necessary to take those next steps. In terms of potential, he‚Äôs really high up there, it‚Äôs just as of now and how I would expect him to develop in the future, I don‚Äôt see it. These questions are just hard cause it‚Äôs completely opinion based and I‚Äôm not a fortune teller. Just my two cents."
"I mean, Curry is probably the greatest off-ball player ever. Imagine having Draymond *and* Lamelo to take the playmaking pressure off him? He'd be avging 35 easy"
LaMelo also has a much tighter handle and seems more decisive with the ball.
I really don't want to get ahead of myself but it might have been obvious after all. The extended scouting period made it harder for teams to properly evaluate what this draft class had. It had LaMelo fucking Ball.
"My aunt actually met Lamelo once. She used to work in the Chino Hills area in a local jewelry shop. Lavar was a frequent and he‚Äôd always chat it and and make the conversation lighter. One day about 3 years ago, he brought this kid with him that looked around the age of 17, who my aunt suspected to be Lamelo but wasn‚Äôt sure of it. So Lavar perused the showcases and purchased some jewelry, as is expected from someone in a store. When billing however, her curiosity got the best of her and she inquired is the kid was a ‚ÄúBall Boy.‚Äù Lavar responded, ‚ÄúThis is Lamelo, not Liangelo.‚Äù"

LaMelo Ball!
It‚Äôs because bleacher report sportscentre only care about lamelo ball now
[LAMELO BALL](https://streamable.com/ryg1ss)  [MYYYYLLEE with the left hand!](https://streamable.com/lz178s)
"Lonzo plays like he's played his whole life with LaMelo lol. *""Gotta throw lobs to my fast brother."" ""Gotta pass the ball to my brother so he can shoot."" ""Gotta steal this ball for my brother.""* lol"
We were saying Malachi Flynn &gt; LaMelo Ball unironically after 2 preseason games as well.
Theres nothing I want more rn than to see a rookie lamelo ball in the playoffs
"What do them being from the same mother have to do with their personality lol. Also some players like Westbrook is a complete alpha personality on the court, but very chill and reserved off the court. Lonzo and Lamelo just have different approaches to the game. Lamelo clearly more talented, which will give him the confidence to take more risks. Lonzo more conservative, but showed in Chino Hills and even at UCLA that he can be very creative with a lot of flair if he plays in the right system. He simply doesn't have the ball skills and ability around the rim of Melo to really express himself in that way."
Also a reminder that there's a clip on Youtube of Freshman LaMelo Ball making RJ Barrett and Anfernee Simons look bad.
The Ball family haters must be on suicide watch. They guaranteed Lamelo would be a bust.
&gt;I guess all the guys working at ESPN or whatever mock draft site should‚Äôve watched the games  ESPN flew Mike Schmitz to N-Z expecting him to roast Melo and he came back saying LaMelo Ball is clear cut the best player in the draft despite his flaws.  Skip to 2:57 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyf7xxIObxw
"Practice, practice, practice.  The main point is being able to bring it to your shooting pocket quickly to start your shot. Doesn't matter if you catch it high, low, left or right, once you get your shooting motion from your pocket, its muscle memory at that point.  Just to add, there are also skilled passers who can hit shooters right where they want it (the shooting pocket). There was an old Danny Green video where he talks about it and being ready to catch it while in your stance. It allows you to be ready and not have to set yourself before going through the motion (so if Lamelo caught it lower, he doesnt have to spend that time bringing the ball down)."
"I've been saying that signing Gordon Hayward was the most underrated move of the offseason, this entire season was talking about ""Hornets wanna stay in mediocrity, why sign a 30 year old injury prone forward"" but giving your future franchise point guard whose game is literally built to share the ball a legitimate scorer is HUGE.  I'm almost confident (with my reddit level analysis) that LaMelo Ball's development played a huge role in them signing Hayward."
Lmao in the postgame interview the announcer actually asked him what he thought of this nickname and Lamelo said he didn't really like it.  I think he said his current nick name is MBx2 (melo ball x miles bridges) which IMO is way worse but tbf he said it was only temporary and they were still working on something
LaMelo Ball is Azor ahai
"Yes sir!  A high profile rookie that loves to share the ball.  (no pun intended)  You can see it when he throws lobs to bridges, bridges has the biggest smile on his face!  And now teammates when they have an opportunity to speak to the press give lamelo praise, unreal for a rookie."
"Yep, all three can be very special in this league . Your first paragraph is funny because Ball seen as the most raw player in the draft . I‚Äôve been telling people about Lamelo for years , and even he‚Äôs suprised with with how fast he‚Äôs learning the game"
"I feel like at least Wiseman and Ant aren't straight up misses -- they're more raw, so it'll take them more time to develop (vs. LaMelo, who came from pro ball in Australia), but the potential is clearly there.  I mean look at Brandon Ingram -- just absolutely god awful shooting splits his rookie season, in subsequent seasons got better but never _quite_ put it all together (partially because of injuries but also because that's just being a young player)...but now 5 years later he's blossomed into an amazing scorer, and pretty knockdown from three/the free throw line.  Some great players just come out firing right out the gate, and some need to develop a little more. Only time will tell."
"100% with you, anyone who‚Äôs actually watched his full games in the past 3 years should know that his talent is undeniable. His handle, passing, and feel for the game were already top tier as a freshman/sophomore. Once he sprouted up to 6‚Äô7 in the JBA/Spire and still kept all his skills/craftiness, it was over.   He has everything you want out of a franchise player, but so many people wrote LaMelo off because his jersey says ‚ÄúBall‚Äù"
"It's so strange to me what lonzo is as a ball player.  He comes across, not in a bad way, as someone that is a nba veteran.  He defers to their play makers, Zion and Ingram, plays solid D, and just kinda plays the game as it unfolds.  Lamelo forces the game onto others.  Might result in a turnover but he plays with such confidence.  Uptempo, takes risks, has a flair for the dramatic.  He is playing the way everyone thought lonzo would out of college."
"Let me be clear - I am not taking into account his experience when saying ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt been good‚Äù. Only judging his performance as is because we are in a thread about Melo who is currently on a fantastic hot stretch that is objectively good.  Wiseman is a great dunker yes. But he also has really bad hands and fumbles the ball a ton. This also hurts his rebounding (along with not knowing how to position himself best and aggression). He‚Äôs got a long way to go until he can put together a stretch like Ball is now. Lot of potential but he‚Äôs gotta realize it   Wiseman being so raw isn‚Äôt good for the Warriors title contention hopes as they need him to be great ASAP to maximize Steph/Dray/Klays window. How long do you have to wait for him is a real question, and a reason that  LaMelo is looking like the superior choice."
"Idk, I think the bigger difference is that LaMelo is exponentially more talented as a ball handler and has much better touch. Some of that is from being just more naturally gifted than Lonzo but you can also see his skillset is just so much more refined. If Lonzo were capable of playing like LaMelo I think he'd have the same level of confidence lol."
"Absolutely he‚Äôs raw around the edges but ‚Äúgenerally hasn‚Äôt been good‚Äù for a rookie who played four college games is absurd imo.   Is he a starting center on a mid-tier playoff team? Maybe not. But who tf expects that seeing his experience? His fluidity with the ball at his size is outrageous, has a nice touch that will improve from outside the paint and his finishing is top tier.   Defence is a major sore point and decision making will come. But let me say Lamelo isn‚Äôt a great defender either and his decision making is a lot higher due to the umpteenth times experience he has over other rookies especially wiseman.  Wiseman ain‚Äôt perfect but he‚Äôs absolutely a special talent from what we‚Äôve seen so far. Top 3 is obviously Him, Lamelo and Halliburton not in that order"
"The moment LaMelo Ball disrespected Mike Conley, this game was over. I don‚Äôt care how nice his game is, you don‚Äôt come in as a rookie and disrespect the most universally respected vet in the league for no reason. He was doing it to get back at Royce O‚ÄôNeale, but like‚Ä¶ say something to Royce then. Mike doesn‚Äôt deserve that shit, especially from a kid."
"LaMelo Ball with 21/7/4 and being the leading scorer against the number 1 team in the league, this kid is gonna be a problem. The taunt has nothing to do with them losing to the hottest team in the league"
Tomorrow on ESPN: is Lamelo Ball the Randy Moss of the NBA??
"Should be, but between this and the Warriors game it seems like league officials are on LaMelo Ball promotion duties."
"SikaM, Randle, iPad,  Grant,  John wall, lamelo ball"
"Well... That's easy to say in hindsight but his first stretch games last season backed up basically everything we feared would be wrong. He was brought in to be a starting point guard, something he is still terrible at.   He took off once he was mostly moved off the ball by the emergence Devonte' Graham and then completely off of it by LaMelo. I couldn't be happier about how it has worked out but he has completely transformed his game over the last couple years. He is absolutely nothing like the player we signed a year and a half ago, and thank god for that."
Honestly I dislike some of the bbbreakdown‚Äôs videos because IMO he seems too biased. He clearly dislikes lebron and it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm a fan of the guy but sometimes he sounds like skip b with some stats. He clearly understands the game but I don‚Äôt particularly like the way he talks. If you watch his latest lamelo ball video it seems like he‚Äôs trying to sell the kid in a comercial lol
"The same is true when Wanamaker has the ball before he's wrapped up by LaMelo and PJ, Steve Kerr called repeatedly for a timeout but the refs wouldn't give it.  It was all around terrible officiating, which sucks because Rozier had a nuclear finish which is kind of being undercut by it."
"ESPN gonna highlight that hug from Lamelo Ball..   ""look at Lamelo he's so happy about his teammate's buzzer beater.. what a rookie.. have you seen that hug from a rookie before?"""
Is Terry Rozier better than prime Tracy McGrady? Is Terry Rozier a Hall of Famer? Did the Celtics mess up by trading Terry Rozier? Should Giannis have signed with Charlotte to play next to Terry Rozier and LaMelo Ball?    Just trying to prepare myself to sort by new over the next couple hours.
"Yes!!! This is the version I wanted to watch over and over again, the version i watched live!!! I was gassing terry up whole game! I LOVE MY HORNETS AND OUR COMMENTATORS!!!!!   Lamelo really helped push hornets though that tough spot and then Scary Terry was released! I even heard we gave Draymond the game ball for showing such sportsmanship tonight!"
"""LaMelo and a Warriors player jump on it"" lol what? Wanamaker had possession but then got mauled by two hornets and the refs decided that was a jump ball, that was the most egregious decision of the game."
"Yes!!! This is the version I wanted to watch over and over again, the version i watched live!!! I was gassing terry up whole game! I LOVE MY HORNETS AND OUR COMMENTATORS!!!!!   Lamelo really helped push hornets though that tough spot and then Scary Terry was released! I even heard we gave Draymond the game ball for showing such sportsmanship tonight!"
"The interesting part is the refs gave the jump ball to PJ Washington instead of Lamelo initially, which probably means they didn't even see what happened.  Wanamaker and Washington stood around in jump position for a good minute before GSW staff got the refs to change it to Lamelo.  Refs were just very inexperienced."
"Warriors up 8. Terry Rozier hits 3 of the most insane shots you‚Äôve ever seen, Oubre also with an insane 3 for the Warriors in between.   Warriors up 2 with the ball with the clock running down. They miss a shot with 12 seconds left, and LaMelo and a Warriors player jump on it, jump ball. Scrappy jump ball, Heyward grabs it and falls down, and Draymond reached down to grab it too. But they awarded the Hornets the timeout first... and here‚Äôs where it gets crazy. Draymond does what he always does and mouths off. So the refs give him a technical or maybe a double technical and he gets ejected.   So the hornets get 2 free throws. Rozier hits both. Then they get the ball back and Terry hit what can only be described as one of the most inanely off balance flying through the air prayer shots of all time, but he was on FIRE. So he hit it as the clock buzzed and the Hornets win.   My mind is still processing, what a treat.   Draymond Green is BIG angry and"
Took them like 5 minutes to figure out Lamelo should‚Äôve been doing the jump ball. Refs were fucking terrible for both sides tonight.
"What a load of horseshit. Trying to pretend LaMelo shouldn‚Äôt be on that jumpball, then pretending the Hornets called a timeout in the .25 second Hayward had the ball?  Draymond‚Äôs a huge fucking liability this whole game, don‚Äôt get me wrong, he cost us this game. But he wouldn‚Äôt have been in a position to if the refs hadn‚Äôt gotten this game in that place."
Why isn‚Äôt LaMelo handling the ball every time he‚Äôs in? I‚Äôve seen Malik Monk bring the ball up as often as LaMelo
"It‚Äôs likely a combination of factors, including getting healthy and finding a rhythm in a season without a training camp. But there is no doubt that psychologically, when you see your kid brother being hailed as the best Ball player in the family in his first few games in the NBA, you are going to be inspired to elevate your game. I mean the guy has been called out many times in his career for being too passive and inaggressive. LaMelo balling out is making him for eager to prove himself and it‚Äôs feeding his confidence which can improve his shot making."
Probably safety protocols  Or... Scared to play lamelo ball
LaMelo is Ball
"LaMelo Ball good, Anthony ""Wiggins"" Edwards trash"
"Also, the NBA today doesn't have layers like it once did. Football is like chess and each play can be broken up and analyzing it is very fun.   Years ago the NBA had sophisticated plays. Ball movement was a great thing. Nowadays, plays are instantly finished by guys chucking threes. I honestly don't blame Steph for that. I blame the guys who want the glory like Steph. Dame lillard has literally mirrored his game off Steph. He was a totally different player 3 years ago. He was more like an Isaiah Thomas(pistons) and it was a breath of fresh air. In comes trae young, this guy just chucks 3s constantly. Everybody wants to be like Steph and it's problematic, even for Steph. It takes away from his game.  The league currently doesn't have a true playmaker. I've only seen this from lamelo. Lamelo is gonna be my fave player as long as he makes his main thing playmaking. I'm just tired of everybody chucking 3s.  We need PFs to bring back the mid range. Currently KD is the only star taking advantage of that   The reason why the people in the media talk like this is because the league itself is full of egos. You have guys worrying about THEIR OWN legacy and not the team.  People have always been protective of their players and teams for decades. This ain't new. It's just how it is and NFL is definitely like that.   It's just that NBA is becoming more toxic because the game itself is just watered down. Jamal Murray made 50 points with just 25 shots. That's damn mighty impressive. Let's be honest tho, am I excited, intrigued? No. I'm not because some other fella will do the same in a month.   Adam silver doesn't realize the problem, but it will come to haunt him in a few years. Stars are made from the offensive end. Guys like Clude drezler, Hakeem, magic and bird, Kobe, Jordan, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, TMAC, Tim Duncan, Garnett, Allen, Iverson, Dwade and Anthony, Lebron. All of these guys made themselves household names because of the offensive not defense. It's obvious. Not many people know guys like Tony Allen who is the greatest defender, top 5 in league history, imo.   Not many players were known to be amazing offensive threats, this led to each time having stars of their own or underdogs (04 pistons). If you have a good majority in the league that are offensive threats then you will not have as many stars as you hope. The NBA made this mistake by taking the big man out of the game. The big man was an amazing piece of the game that had to be removed in order to speed up the offense.   I don't know about you younger fellas. Watching Penny and Shaq in the 90s was the most entertaining piece of Basketball I've ever seen. It was insane.  Steve Nash and the Amare duo was crazy too. The spurs and their ball movement was amazing.   The NBA needs to make a transition over the next few years. They need to start bringing the big man back. That's literally what's missing from the game. That is the reason why it feels so bland and empty honestly. If everybody chucks 3s, then they're not exciting anymore."
1) LaMelo Ball  2) Anthony Edwards   3) James Wiseman
How can someone be 6' 5 and relatively athletic and be so bad at the rim- like all time bad.   He needs to go to Lamelo ball camp or something.
Lon o is a solid player. But I think the best of the ball brothers has to be lamelo
I'd say the pre-draft hype for Ricky was similar to Lamelo Ball. Both were passing prodigies with some  pretty big holes in their game.
This post going to be like that RDC_World Lamelo Ball video with everyone praising Embiid and Maxey just weeping in the background lol
So is LaMelo Ball
LaMelo Ball will go scoreless today.

So is Tyrese Haliburton and Lamelo Ball!
"Anthony Edwards - OJ Mayo 2.0  James Wiseman - poor mans Toronto Chris Bosh  LaMelo Ball - prime Penny Hardaway without the injuries, MVP"
"Michael Jordan and LaMelo Ball, what a sight that would be"
"Kevin O Connor said Killian Hayes was a better prospect than Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, and Lamelo Ball lmao. Listen to this guy speak and you know he's never picked up a ball in his life."
"I live in America but I only got into basketball last year. I'm from Michigan, but I don't have any strong affiliation to the Pistons. I feel like that home team spirit is something you get from being a kid and watching everyone else root for them.  Instead, I just root for the players I like watching. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Jokic and most recently Lamelo Ball are players I root for."
"LaMelo Ball - The real Steph Curry w 40 inch vertical James Wiseman - Slow and less athletic left handed Giannis, can shoot way better though  Anthony Edwards - gonna be 80-90% of prime Dwyane Wade"
he said lamelo ball cmon read
"Lamelo Ball  Kobe Bryant (Joe Johnson and Wade, honorable mentions)  Lebron James  Tim Duncan  Dirk"
Jason Williams  LaMelo Ball  LeBron James  Chris Bosh  Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal
I know Terry had a solid season last year but I'm convinced that part of his success is him being an excellent fit next to LaMelo Ball. Dude's an undersized 2-guard.
You think Trae is the only one getting these calls?  [Look no further than the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lmdms0/highlight_dame_with_the_clutch_drive_and1_to_give/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) post on Lillards drive.  He dives hard into LaMelo and Ball gets the foul called on him lmao
The problem is the refs call fouls on the defensive player every time the guy with the ball initiates contact.  It's not just Trae.  [Look at Dame](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lmdms0/highlight_dame_with_the_clutch_drive_and1_to_give/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) on this play on the front page right now... That is perfect defense from LaMelo (and great shot by Lillard) but he gets whistled because Lillard barrels into him then bounces off as if Melo was the one creating the contact.
"If Lamelo ball did this, this post would have 11.1k upvotes at least and be at the top of the front page of r/nba"
He was the Malachi Flynn to Cash Considerations‚Äô LaMelo Ball
"Firstly, Ben has the ball in his hands a lot more right now. Second, LaMelo has exceptional court vision and has lots of passes that don‚Äôt lead to assists, either hockey assists or misses cause Zeller and Biyombo suck. Ben isn‚Äôt a bad passer, he‚Äôs a great passer. But LaMelo is an exceptional passer, there‚Äôs a reason CHA is #2 in team assists, a huge improvement from last year."
LaMelo Ball
"* Right- Hawks and Raptors struggling. I thought the Hawks, despite the amount of talent they brought in, would struggle because they had so many mouths to feed. With Trae monopolizing the ball, some of those new players would struggle. I thought the Raptors had lost enough depth (especially at C) that they'd regress from the highs of the past few years and be a lower-level playoff team.  * Wrong: I thought Lamelo was a sure-fire bust and a bad fit for the Hornets. I've never been happier to be proven wrong in my life. While Lamelo's numbers in Australia were bad, I didn't account for the fact that they were a ten-game sample size and Melo had total control of the ball. With our more measured offense, he's been a much better player and isn't gassed all the time, so he can put more effort in on D."
"Right: Gordon Hayward, Christian Wood, Lamelo Ball being good at some point  Wrong: Jerami Grant, Lamelo Ball not being the worst player in the league in his first season"
Anthony Edwards is better than Lamelo Ball.
"It‚Äôs not just because Ball is a bigger name, it‚Äôs because Edwards has had dogshit efficiency, and doesn‚Äôt rebound, get assists, or play defense. Lamelo doesn‚Äôt really play defense either, but he does rebound and playmake."
"It‚Äôs really crazy that he gets NO discussion for ROY just because of the fact that ‚ÄúBall‚Äù is kinda a household name.  LaMelo is doing great too don‚Äôt get me wrong, but the ROY race really should be neck and neck.  Ant leads all rookies in scoring, which in the first few games could be written off as ‚Äúhe plays in a lot of garbage time‚Äù but he‚Äôs been starting for a few weeks now and has stepped up"
Yes by miles. Zion is already an amazing scorer in fantastic efficiency. His defense is amazing compared to lamelos abysmal ness on the other end of the ball. If zion devolps a feasible jump shot and stays healthy he could very easily be the best player in the league even right now zion is so much better than lamelo is not even funny. Lamelo is debatably not better than his bro right now
Lamelo Ball is a better playmaker than Jeff Teague
Lamelo does not fit the warrior's offense.  He needs to handle the ball a lot.
And that‚Äôs where the chorus sings all you needed was some lamelo ball. Bob fucked up real hard surrounding the unknowns on wiseman
"Trae right now, but I have a feeling the answer will be different 12 months from now. Ball has the same advantage over Trae that Luka does-size. Luka is much improved defensively this year, and I am sure LaMelo will get better as well. Trae will probably always be a defensive liability."
"Idk about that case, Ball and Haliburton have been on fire as of late, its understandablly close. But I agree it's not like Lamelo has it on lock rn"
"Lamelo because he can affect the game in more ways than Tre. Rebounding, passing, Defense, versatility, off ball potential meaning he won't NEED the ball in his hands to be productive. I mean a 6'6 All Around Guard that can do almost anything you ask of him on both sides of the ball guarding and playing 1-3, or a 6'1 offensive superstar that can score and playmakes but pretty much isn't that good at anything else. I'm taking the All Around player any day because it's way easier to game plan around and for him to succeed."
"&gt; You have two ball brothers Lonzo and Lamelo.   Their grandfather Cedric\* played for the Clippers thirty years ago.  &amp;#x200B;  \*he isn't really, as far as I know"
1. What's your favorite color?   a) Orange   b) Blue   c) Green   d) Lamelo Ball
dude is gonna lose ROY to an over usage Lamelo Ball. Haliburton clearly the better player.
"Lamelo ball was ranked 23rd by 247 composite and 26th by 247. He was a 4 star recruit and projected as a second round pick by 247 on December 12th, 2018.   He was on the radar but usually guys don‚Äôt start grading out as surefire NBA prospects until their senior year of high school/during their one and done year."
"LaMelo ball wasn‚Äôt seriously in draft consideration until about a year and a half ago, he had a lot of flaws he cleaned up and the Lithuania shit didn‚Äôt end up fucking him over like it could have."
"The Hornets already tried the Drummond experiment in Dwight Howard.  That being said, LaMelo Ball throwing lobs to Drummond might actually make him a star... Lol."
Lamelo no question. Trae is an amazing playmaker and scorer but defensively he‚Äôs such a liability. I think lamelo can be just as good offensively and is already a better defender and rebounder because of size/athleticism. Lamelo ball all day.
"Ball because of the size.  Trae is so tiny.  There was a play where LaMelo basically backed him down from the 3 point line all the way to the basket and got an easy uncontested layup.    It was at that point I thought, maybe Trae's defense will always be a huge liability.  Edit: @2:21   https://youtu.be/ysdnWSZYtS8"
lamelo ball his potential is better than trae young. this is who trae young‚Äôs gonna be his whole career not a winning player
The whole ball family trying to cover up MJ. LaMelo at MJs team. Lonzo looking like he's going to MJs old team. Lavar said he was better than MJ at one on one. All they need is Liangelo to get a degree from UNC
Without LaMelo the Hornets would be near the bottom of the Eastern Conference  I dislike the Ball family but i have to admit LaMelo is good
How much can you attribute his rise in usage to playing with Sexton as his PG? He went from 20% in detroit to 30% in Cleveland. Detroit wasn‚Äôt lighting the world on fire but they did build a playoff team with him as a top 2-3 player on the team. I wonder if playing with someone like Lamelo or Lowry would be addition by just having him make less decisions with the ball in his hand.

"Chino Hills first started primarily with Lonzo‚Äôs hype being a top pick of his class. LaMelo was more of a sideshow. I know there‚Äôs casuals out there who watch abit of Lonzo, heard about Lavar and the Ball bros and then turned off the TV. They heard the hype but felt ‚Äòmehh‚Äô about it. when Lonzo turned out a ‚Äòbust‚Äô, people come out the floodgates saying Lavar talks a bunch of crap and the Ball bros are overrated.  They bunch Gelo and Lamelo and said they‚Äôre overhyped because of Lonzo. while Gelo is indeed overhyped (which is obvious you watch him play, dude doesn‚Äôt have bball savvy), Melo has incredible handles since young and has massive confidence (pointing at the logo and hitting it as a kid). He was smooth af on the court. Anybody who watch him would know he‚Äôs a top pick talent. But these ‚Äòhaters‚Äô calling him bust never actually watched him. Just bunched him with his brothers."
"Donte is cheaper and has potential. Brook is a big that you need  More minutes for Devonte Graham and Lamelo Ball.  Better fit  Graham-Ball-Hayward-PJ-Brook with DD, Monk, Bridges, and Zeller off the bench."
"LaMelo Ball is the shiny new toy now.  Zion doesn‚Äôt have super gaudy counting stats either (great stats, but he doesn‚Äôt get triple doubles, 40 point nights, etc.)"
"Nah Terry has been legitimately good this year. His on the ball shenanigans have been limited, he can be a sparkplug or a late clock option in the offense when we need him to be but now that we have Hayward/LaMelo he's mostly off-ball and hunting spot-up looks. He has a knack for hitting difficult shots and creating things out of nowhere in a way that really helps our team - it's like a Lou Williams type role. Quite frankly I don't give a shit what the on/off numbers say, he's been better than Devonte this season (who's been forcing up difficult shots that he can't hit consistently)."
Sometimes I wonder how the fk the Ball bros get so much hype and nobody actually watches LaMelo play. It‚Äôs like they only watch Lonzo at Chinos and assume all Ball bros are overhyped lol.   LaMelo was on some Kyrie swagger since then.
"Lamelo ball is the best point guard of all time, don't let these comments fool you"
"Where do the Ball brothers rank among active NBA brothers?  I got em 2nd  1. Steph and Seth 2. Lamelo and Lonzo 3. Giannis and Kostas (or Thanasis) 4. Jrue and Justin (or Aaron) 5. Brook and Robin 6. Marcus and Markieff (yeah I know that's disrespectful, but they're slacking this year) 7. Cody and Caleb 8. Jalen and Jaden (yeah the McDaniels are worse than the Martins)"
"LaMelo Ball / Cody Martin / Caleb Martin / Jalen McDaniels / Bismack Biyombo  It's our own death, but still"
i am a big melo fan  big clap for lamelo ball
Eh still think lonzo ball is better. Defense = good but lamelo is cool. Lavar is the best B-ball dad in history
Zo - Lonzo Ball and Alonzo Mourning  &amp;   Melo - LaMelo Ball and Carmelo Anthony
No he wouldn't. Lamelo Ball has been far better in almost every single category. He's been outstanding since getting the starting job
Zion is alright...but Lamelo is in a whole other level in terms of popularity and talent.  1 Year Later...  Lamelo Ball is alright...but Cade Cunningham is really special probably the best prospect since LeBron  Rinse and repeat
"And like Lonzo is literally one of the chillest players in the league. Dudes been in no scandals, doesn‚Äôt even celebrate on court, humble in interviews, and if you seen them old Chino Hills videos before the Ball bro‚Äôs were even famous, Zo is goofy asl (so is Melo lmao). I get people gettin irked by Lavar, and I can see why some people may dislike LaMelo (he did have some issues in Lithuania and a lil after but I don‚Äôt blame him he was 15-16 lmao), but like Lonzo has literally done nothing lmao. He‚Äôs as professional as they come."
"how good would a team of all ball brothers be? lonzo, lamelo, liangelo, lil dicky, cb3  best d1 team probably"
" There are a few factors that make a comparison difficult. The first factor is Carlisle vs Borrego. Once Carlisle understood what he had, he gave the keys to Luka and let him be the center of the offense. Borrego is still playing lamelo off the ball for large stretches of the game. The other factor is Lamelo has only been starting for 6-7 games and the numbers since starting are dramatically different. Luka started all 72 games his rookie season.  Anyway heres the per36 numbers for both of them, but keep in mind the Luka sample size is 3 times larger.  &gt;Luka    (72 games) 23.7pts 6.7 ast 8.7rbs .71ft% .33 3pt% .42 fg%  &gt;Lamelo(27 games) 19.2pts 8.0 ast 7.9rbs .79ft% .35 3pt% .44 fg%  Looks pretty similar to me. Luka is averaging 2 more baskets a game but he also averaged 2.5 more shots a game.  Its still early and we are dealing with a small sample size, but the people trying to dismiss this thread as ridiculous, arent actually being objective. Its no different from Luka's rookie year and people were dismissing the Lebron comparisons even though the numbers were there for you to look at."

Mikal Bridges has no NBA accolades and barely a good season.  Roco has a 1st place All NBA Defensive team.  Recency bias would make you think Lamelo Ball is better than Jokic too

Terry as a spot-up shooter is elite. Terry as a primary ball handler is not. LaMelo being the playmaker he is should let Terry do what he does best moving forward.
I was sure that Lamelo Ball would be a bust. Boy was I wrong.
Tough choice as there‚Äôs no good comparison for Lamelo so it‚Äôs hard to tell what his ceiling is. While for Edward it‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs going to be in the mold of James Harden (very ball dominant scorer with well above average playmaking) if he actually reaches his potential
"LaMelo already won the narrative game and has all the media hype from just being a Ball brother. Even if the teams had the same record, he would still probably have won it. I see his highlights all over social media. The fact they are the 5 seed rn makes him essentially a lock to win it."
"Edwards still shooting 47%TS on the year, sub 40 fg% and 31 3pt%. He‚Äôs had a good stretch of games and gets the highlight dunks but Lamelo been good all year. Edwards going to have to play like this the rest of the year and even then it‚Äôs still a conversation because Ball is a great facilitator and the stronger defender at this point in their careers"
Not to mention this year's draft is miles better than this previous one. Although Lamelo Ball seems special.
"Lmaooo busto ball cost them the game by thinking he was Lamelo and tried to ""takeover"" at the end of the 4th. Dude is a bust"
"Lonzo, LaMelo, LiAngelo. The 3 Ball generation."
"Lamelo Ball has made the Hornets pretty fun this year, that team might actually be exciting for the next few years"
"Obligatory ""fuck Trae young"".  Lamelo ball or Anthony Edwards üëå"
What's this supposed to show? Isn't Melo listed at 6'7? Based on his posture he looks taller than Lamelo Ball in this photo.
"Someone that has the athleticism and verticality to be able to catch lobs and finish dunks, at the 5 meaning as a Center (positions are numbered 1 through 5). A good example is if you look at the sixers, our main 5s/centers are Joel Embiid and Dwight Howard. Embiid‚Äôs obviously amazing, but he‚Äôs not much of a lob threat. He doesn‚Äôt get up in the air super quickly, he‚Äôs quick on his feet moving around but he‚Äôs not jumping out of the gym on a consistent basis. Dwight has a far more limited skillset, but he‚Äôs a terrific lob threat. He has a huge ‚Äúcatch radius‚Äù meaning he has a lot of range for where passers can put the ball on an alley oop, it doesn‚Äôt need to be perfectly placed.   LaMelo is an incredible passer, and plays extremely well at a fast pace and in transition, and having a center who is a true lob threat (compared to Cody Zeller and Bismarck Biyombo who are not), would benefit both players a lot."
lamelo ball would be a nice fit on this warriors team
Yeah but our team is so bad Ant was basically playing 1 v 5 all year so I'd say he played enough college ball to cover for Wiseman and LaMelo
All it took was Lamelo to turn your whole franchise around  Even when we had Liangelo Ball for a month or so our game threads were like 10x poppin w people like WHERES GELO???
Lamelo Ball and Ja Morant. They're both must see TV for me
"I mean the Hornets acquired Lamelo Ball and Gordon Hayward so he will have less usage compared to last year, but I really like PJ Washington as a player. Really great 3/D guy, hornets got a steal in him."
Lamelo is a better shooter how ja be better of the ball
It's only a matter of time for Lavar Ball to kick off a campaign tour pushing Lamelo for ROY.
We're all being paid by LaMelo Ball to talk shit about Edwards
LaMelo Ball.
"I understand what you are saying, just saying ""playmaker"" may have been too crude that I tried to rectify by also saying initiator. Rozier and Hayward (also Graham) are comfortable as primary ball handlers is prob the more accurate way I should have phrased it.  I have no doubt LaMelo is the best playmaker on the Hornets, you can see how special he is, especially in transition. But he doesn't have to bear as great of a burden running the offense as Ja has had to, which is what I was trying to get at by mentioning Rozier, Hayward and now Graham.   The only player Grizz have that can function well as a primary ball handler was Tyus Jones, who almost never shares the court with Ja. Lots of secondary ball handlers like Melton, Brooks, Anderson etc but that is why they struggled in the bubble so much with Tyus out. The offense absolutely cratered every time Ja left the floor because no one else could run the offense effectively.   I didn't mention this in the post by Ja was also 4th in the NBA for assists in the 4Q last season, only behind Lebron, Simmons and Rubio. He wasn't just scoring in the 4Q, he literally just took over crunch time for the Grizz whether it was scoring or setting up teammates.   As most Grizz fans can attest, Ja actually defers as a pass first guy too much at times and doesn't look for his own shot which can get annoying esp when he's the best crunch time option. Which you can see play out in the stats even, since he's had a higher Assist% both seasons than LaMelo has this season."
"Yes, but hey, remember Wiseman is almost a HS to NBA prospect. Guys like Lamelo or Edwards have had time to be ""the man"" the past year (Ball in the NBL Illawarra Hawks and Anthony Edwards in Georgia). Wiseman barely played in the college level. Also, the Warriors scheme is brilliant but complicated. Give the kid some time and I'm pretty sure he'll be good. He looks fluid for a 7 foot tall guy."
It always confuses the hell out of me when people refer to LaMelo Ball as ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù because I always associate that nickname with Carmelo Anthony. And then you had to go and use it on an actual post involving Carmelo. C‚Äômon man! Making me think too much
"Been overshadowed by Lamelo so far, but people forget Ant was not #1 by accident. He can ball"
Lamelo ball   If AAU was a person lamelo is the perfect style
"He's 19 years old and went from basically high school ball to Kerr's motion offense with an all new roster that also was trying to figure out how to play together. No G-League time. Basically no college ball (3 games? Lmao).  What the fuck were people expecting exactly? Anyone with an iota of basketball iq knows that this type of raw big man is going to take literal YEARS to develop.  Like, the people comparing him to Lamelo for example are just flat out admitting how little they actually know about basketball. Sure, Wiseman's getting minutes, but they're essentially forced minutes with no set rotation/stable lineup. Kid's literally in the fire trying to figure it out. He'll be more than fine."
"you're definitely right that it's something that can be pointed to, and he sure can improve, but he's nowhere close to rookie Lonzo on defense. LaMelo came in looking pretty lost on rotations and outmatched a lot of the time on more physical and more athletic players. Was getting a lot of his steals by gambling in passing lanes early on.  He's improved as the season's gone along and looks like less of a defensive liability than he did 20 or 30 games ago. Growing into a legit SF sized player is the absolute best case scenario for his defense imo, lets him be mostly off the ball where he can roam passing lanes and stuff, and I don't have faith in him keeping up with the Ja's of the PG position athletically."
"Yeah I keep seeing people say lamelo wouldn't be good for them, but have they watched the Warriors this year?  They have Brad Wanamaker and Damion Lee handling the ball a very worrying amount.  In their situation I'd much rather have another ball handler who is already very good than a center who isn't that good right now but might be good in 2-3 years."
With a name like LaMelo Ball you don't even need a nickname
"Steph and Klay aren‚Äôt LeBron and LaMelo isn‚Äôt Lonzo. Steph and Klay are two of the best off ball scorers in league history. LaMelo also has the size to play SG or SF, just like Klay, so they could easily all play together. Do you really think a generational passer wouldn‚Äôt be able to fit next to the two best shooters of all time??  Wiseman can still be good, but I think it‚Äôs crazy to say that the Warriors wouldn‚Äôt have a brighter immediate future with LaMelo."
LaMelo doesn‚Äôt have his ‚ÄòBall‚Äô body yet and is still balling out. That‚Äôs important.
"No thanks, miss me with the reality TV stuff lol. I'm a fan of the *whole* thing that the Hornets have going for them, not LaMelo specifically, though he's an important part of it!  Seems like everything worked out, especially Ball,Rozier, and Hayward, and the team is playing very healthy ball. All 3 were risky acquisitions. No ego, ball hogging, unhappiness, or nobody who doesn't fit with what's going on."
Too bad you were late on the Lavar Ball Bros party. we had an incredible time watching LaMelo grow up.
Ohhh Carmelo Anthony!   I thought for a sec it was Lamelo Ball when I read it like damn that was quick

"Warriors desperately need a competent backup PG that can also create offense for himself. His BBIQ looks great, so I think he's a plug-and-play type player for most offensive systems. He'd probably learn Kerr's motion offense faster than Oubre did (and it took Oubre more than a month to adjust to the dumbed down version, although he's been pretty good after).   Also, have you watched Warriors games recently? Dray brings up the ball while Curry's moving off-ball like half the time. Nobody else can really make good passes except those two. Even throwing lobs to Wiseman shouldn't be hard, and Dray and Steph are the only 2 guys who seem to be able to throw it up comfortably for him (whether he finishes or not is up to him).  There is no fit issue w/ LaMelo, Steph, and Klay. Defense would be an issue, but it's the same for rookie Wiseman, and would improve. In fact, he's tall for a PG, so if he fills out a bit he's got the physical tools, and Warriors have a very good defensive coaching staff. His offensive talents just need some refining.  Wiseman might be worth the wait, but in hindsight drafting LaMelo and getting a big off the market might've been a better decision."
"I've hated Carmelo and his game his whole career, but show some respeck. Dude is going to be a top 10 scorer ever. LaMelo Ball has to wait his turn"
i Love Lamelo Ball!
When you draft someone ahead of a player like LaMelo Ball (who is having one of the best age-19 seasons in NBA history)...
Seriously how does LaMelo Ball get away with calling himself Melo?   There is only one Melo.
"Over the next decade?  1. Trae  2. Ja  3. Ball  Trae is the most polished of the three right now and we know what he is for sure as a player. I feel more confident in him staying as good as he is now. Ja has the highest upside, but also the lowest floor and LaMelo has a higher floor, but a lower ceiling."
I had someone tell me about Lamelo being one of the best PG in the league. I responded he‚Äôs the 3rd best pg on his team and second best Ball in the NBA and was looked at like I was an alien. Do people not watch games? Is it just hot takes and social media highlights that people base their opinions off of? I dont know if it‚Äôs a generational thing or what but I don‚Äôt understand a lot of nba fans.
"He's our best player. I really want to give Gordon Hayward respect but goddamn. When he's in , lead increases. When he's out, lead decreases. It's scary how good he is. If NBA teams knew this was what they were getting out of Lamelo Ball , teams would be killing each other trying to trade up for that pick. He's literally the steal of the draft at #3 . Wow."
LaMelo Ball is LaMelo Ball. Melo is forever.
"Melo has always been Carmelo. 'Ball' is Lamelo, since he's the better of his brothers. Lonzo can be Lonzo"
Melo is Lamelo ball. This ain't 2008 anymore. It's CARMELO now
Is LaMelo Ball the best player on the Hornets?
"Ait let's do it Genius style  *Fuck you* - LaMelo betting on himself and his unorthodox fundamentals instead of listening to the noise  *Backed by walking the walk* - From the saying walking the walk, not talking the talk. Actions not words.  With a helluva lot of self-confidence - Ball playing w/ a lot of spice  *Sexy af* - basketball broner"
"He has better stats in essentially everything except rebounds, which hardly matters anyway for ball handlers since they're just grabbing them from their bigs anyway.   LaMelo goat."
Lamelo ball is the next lamelo ball.
"I was an advocate for taking LaMelo Ball first in the draft because I thought he would be really good. However, I didn't think he'd be this good this fast. I can already see him being an all-star next season."
"Kemba is good. But LaMelo is way better (when accounting for age and career progression).   Far better shooter, passer, ball handler, defender, etc. at similar stages to Kemba."
"Sure, I could be wrong. But I‚Äôd also be willing to wager that Lamelo will be a superstar in 5 years. His ball-handling, touch, and passing are literally 99th percentile despite being 6‚Äô7. He‚Äôs also shooting 38% which is incredible given his broken form. You give him 15-pounds and fix his shot form and he‚Äôll be one of the most unstoppable offensive talents in the league.  Sure, Wiseman could be good, but it‚Äôs always an uphill climb for a big to match the impact of a perimeter player. You need to be on the level of someone like Embiid and Jokic, and I don‚Äôt ever see Wiseman teaching that level. I see Wiseman‚Äôs ceiling being somewhere around KAT‚Äôs level- an incredibly gifted offensive big, but lacking defensive mobility and IQ"
"&gt; Because the Dubs with a 5 that has guard speed, can guard the perimeter, and shoot would be unstoppable lmao, vs having another elite ball handler and playmaker.  Lamelo is a significantly better shooter than Wiseman right now. The only think wiseman is better in is 3 point percentage on extremely low volume, but he is absolutely atrocious when looking at free throw and midrange shooting numbers on higher volume. Having ""guard speed""  has nothing to do with whether he's good or not. Having another elite ball handler and playmaker is additive, not redundant, especially with Steph and draymond aging.   &gt; Players don‚Äôt develop at a linear rate my dude, and age has 0 to do with it.  lmao wtf, age is by far the biggest factor is player development, which is why lottery picks are nearly always younger 19 year olds over more nba-ready 22 year olds."
"So i know a lot of people are sour on this take by KOC but I do think a lot of you are kind of underestimating Lamelo‚Äôs size. Being a 6‚Äô8‚Äù (listed) true PG is going to give Lamelo a lot of advantages as he develops and I THINK that plays a major role in KOC‚Äôs assessment.  Being an elite ball handler and passer at his size, while being clearly ahead of schedule in terms of his scoring ability makes me think this take isn‚Äôt as crazy as some people are taking it.  Also with his height, he SHOULD naturally progress into one of the top defenders at the position in a way Trae and Ja won‚Äôt be.  His take isn‚Äôt necessarily about ‚Äúwhose better right now‚Äù. His take is about who will be better 5-10 years from now, who would be better to build a team around, and Lamelo should have more tools at his disposal based on his skillset at his size.  At least that‚Äôs how I read it. I think most people in this thread are TOO focused on ‚Äúwhat these players are RIGHT NOW‚Äù vs the prediction I think KOC is trying to make.  But I could be wrong, and KOC could literally mean he thinks he‚Äôs better than them right now and in that case the backlash is warranted, but I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs trying to say here."
"Woow, if it wasn't Lamelo Ball this dude would be frontrunner for rookie of the year, tough."
Lamelo Ball is really good at basketball and I think he'll be best one day
Trae Young  Kawhi Leonard  Luka Doncic  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Jayson Tatum  Bam Adebayo  LaMelo Ball  Are the only current players winning an MVP in their careers
"&gt;CHA is blessed with a LaMelo Ball, not a crystal one.  you made this thread just for that pun right"
"I think LaMelo has a shot. He's at 2.8 3pm/gm since becoming a starter. He's not a guy who likes to work in the midrange as much as Tatum or SGA, so his FGAs will be more heavily weighted towards the arc, but his light to shoot should be almost as green as theirs. And like them - and unlike say, Haliburton or Gary Trent - he's gonna have the ball in his hands a ton.   He's starting way younger than Curry did, so he doesn't have to match Curry's pace (career 3.6 3pm/gm) in order to catch him in totals - the same way Kobe and Lebron eventually caught up to Jordan, despite scoring at a slower pace."
"Australia's domestic league isnt as good as our national team would indicate.  Still very high standard of ball, many of our players went through the NCAA system and played in Europe or the NBA.  We also seem to be good experience for players taking an unconventional route to the NBA i.e Stephen Jackson and LaMelo Ball both started in Australia.  Basketball is really popular here as far as participation, amd the NBA is followed by a lot of people. The local league doesnt pull huge crowds, but does have diehard fans."
"I can see the argument there as Rozier was great before Kyrie came. However, I personally think Rozier is great for Charlotte with LaMelo and Hayward both being great ball movers, but cannot play the way he wants to in Boston where JT and JB need the ball so much and are not nearly as good playmakers.   Kemba's also basically an upgrade over Rozier in every respect including Rozier's best skill, shooting. We also sorely need veteran leadership on our incredibly young team which Rozier would not provide. Obviously it looks bad right now, and the comparison to Rozier looks close, because Kemba had has so much knee problems but he has had a great career of health up until Boston, and we still have plenty of time left with him. I'm glad we're taking it slow w/ his recovery now which will hopefully ease things up.   Honestly the only thing I have to question Ainge about at this point is whether we need a better medical and training staff lol."

"I seem to remember quite a few people referring to him as ‚ÄúLmao Ball‚Äù for his first week or so in the league.   I saw one of our fellow fans downvoted in the negative hundreds right around the new year for simply stating that LaMelo was in the upper quartile of passers in the NBA.  There‚Äôs the famous ‚Äúhow is a prospect that that can‚Äôt shoot, can‚Äôt defend, has no handle, etc. be projected in the first round‚Äù (or whatever) post. The Malachi Flynn debacle.  We could probably pull up old threads for days. People hated this kid, called him a bust before he even played, clowned us for the pick and mocked Melo ruthlessly.  Now he was a no-brainer can‚Äôt-miss guy. Sure."
"How is Bron top when it‚Äôs ‚Äòonly pass‚Äô? Lol. So many others have better passing technique than Bron.  I‚Äôd take Rondo, Paul, Luka, Jokic, Ben and Young over Bron off passing skills.  Fkin‚Äô LaMelo Ball has better passing technique than Bron. Lol."

"When they said Ball, I thought they meant LaMelo"
Lonzo and lamelo ball
"I'm sorry but without a crystal ball no team would give much for that pick. Lamelo was seen as an inefficient defensive liability, with a huge distraction coming alongside him"
"The problem with LaMelo all along was the dilemma of where he would fit in the lineup last year.  We saw something similar with the D'angelo experiment.  Curry, Klay, and Lamelo are all guards.  They can't all 3 be out there at once unless you want serious D mismatches.  The Wiseman pick allowed for the warriors to build around A Curry-Klay-Dray trio that filled the Warriors biggest 2015 weakness of no center.  Even in hindsight, I think I'd still rather have Wiseman over Ball as of now"
"Does this sub just enjoy shitting on 19 year olds unless their name is lamelo ball? Like good grief, shut the fuck up already."
"Just basing it off of my brief chance to watch LaMelo this year. They both carry themselves very similarly when they have the ball. LaMelo is a much better outside shooter at this point, but that‚Äôs really the only difference I see."
"Lamelo Ball has generational vision and playmaking, throw him 2 of the greatest off ball players who can ignite for 50 when they want too along with a great scorer in Lamelo and it doesn‚Äôt get better. Lamelo also fits the shooting the warriors love and his passing is infectious. Adding him to this offense would be too perfect. Especially considering the warriors are wasting a year of prime Curry with klay out. Defensively you do an ‚Äúon‚Äù ‚Äúoff‚Äù in crunch time, like how the hornets do with Cody Martin and lamelo. Warriors whiffed the pick"
Ngl I thought ‚ÄúBall‚Äù was referring to LaMelo Ball
I thought the title meant ball as in Lamelo Ball like ran into MJ or something lol
I thought this was gonna be lamelo ball running out of bounds to get words of wisdom from Mj. The truth is much more boring.
For some reason reading the title i thought lamelo ball went out of bounds and dove into jordan.
"I watched confused wondering where Lamelo ""Ball"" was."
"The title was misleading, read it as"" Lamelo ball goes out of bounds straight to MJ"""
"Wiseman just aint that good and is worse at every aspect of the game than Lamelo aside from rim running. warriors fans have somehow deluded themselves into thinking that wiseman has a higher ceiling than a younger player who can shoot better, dribble the ball better, has significantly higher basketball IQ, drive better, can create his own shot better, and is already good enough to run an entire team's offense for a winning team."
By ball I thought he you were talking about Lamelo Ball.....
I thought it was going to be Lamelo Ball running out of bounds and falling on MJ.  Instead it‚Äôs this.  I want those 5 seconds of my life back.
"When Steph is not on the floor there isn't any playmaking, ball handlers, no offense whatsoever. Lamelo would have been perfect as a secondary playmaker for them"
For some reason I thought the title meant Lamelo Ball ran out of bounds into MJ on a hustle play and yeah I don‚Äôt wanna say how many times I rewound this clip like a doofus
I'm not sure if Lamelo is a home run for Mitch. Ball Edwards and Wiseman were not falling out of the top 3 so he just had the last pick of the bunch.
Can't be the only one who thought it meant (Lamelo) Ball.
I‚Äôll go out on a limb and say Lamelo Ball will be better than Tyreke Evans.
I really thought this was about to be LaMelo running for a ball out of bounds and jumping into MJ lol
I thought Lamelo was running to the sidelines to catch the ball and fall directly into MJ..
"Anyone who actually watched LaMelo (which surprisingly wasn't NBA scouts) new that LaMelo had the most talent in this draft.  The guy had instincts, big moments in the NBL and played for a shitty coach, with a terrible cast around him.    The coach would constantly take the ball out of Melo's hands, and would have him spot up a lot on the perimeter. The games where Melo was the general, you could really see the guy was about it and had the extreme talent.    Same with the Vlade fuck up on Luka."
Thought it was gonna be Lamelo flying into MJ trying to save a loose ball lol
I really thought it was going to be LaMelo diving into MJ after he fell into the bench to save the ball not too long ago
I'd like to clarify that the Ball in the title is not Lamelo. Lmao my bad
"""A home run with LaMelo""  I hate it when people act like the success/failure of rookies is already decided. May as well warm up Tyreke Evans's place in the Hall of Fame, wasn't he the best player in his draft class?  LaMelo Ball has made *a promising start*, but it's way too soon to know how good he's actually going to be."
"Lamelo Ball, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion Williamson, Luka Doncic"
"i trust the warriors coaching staff enough, they probably have given LaMelo as many minutes as possible as the main ball handler when Steph was resting, but you're right that he would be playing with the Warriors' subpar bench and would look a lot weaker because of it."
"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
"The Warriors wanted Lamelo, they even told Lamelo they were drafting him. Ball posted on his IG that he was going to the Warriors at 2. But then they changed their mind for whatever fuckin reason lol idiots"
"I'd make two points:  1.  LaMelo missed a month.  Edwards could only technically be said to have  played basketball in January.   2.  Edwards is a scorer only, and Ball still leads him in that category as well as pretty much every other.    I'm glad LaMelo came back, as recency bias could certainly have swayed the vote, but I just don't see how anyone compares their bodies of work and contends that Edwards is the better player."
Does he really think Lamelo Ball has been in the NBA for 3 years lmao? What an idiot  Deleting in 3...2...1
How dare someone disgrace the Melo name by giving it to LaMelo ball.
Lamelo Ball
"Well, when he was injured his team went 5-2 before Hayward got injured, with the only losses coming against Phoenix and Brooklyn. That's why I'm saying they might be better without him. (While when Lonzo got injured his rookie season it had a major negative impact on his team).  Lonzo is currently better, but you can make an argument Lamelo is better than Lonzo was as a rookie. Lamelo has two advantages over rookie Lonzo. 1) he is shooting much better than Lonzo did. That said, the comparison is not necessarily fair since people have been rooting *for* lamelo while everyone rooted against Lonzo. No player ever had to deal with the hate Lonzo had to deal with. 2) Lamelo is more aggressive going to the rim, which opens more options for his team. As a rookie, though, Lonzo was a better passer, rebounder, and defender.  Currently Lonzo is better both offensively and defensively. It's not even really close. Lonzo is shooting better from the field and the line (Lamelo gets to the line more, though he isn't exactly gang busters at that), is more efficient from the field in shot choice, and provides better passing (Lamelo averages more assists because he is played on ball more -- SVG plays lonzo off ball which seems like a mistake to me.) And while I don't think Lamelo is bad defensively, Lonzo is clearly better.  You could argue Lamelo could end up being better. That might happen, but if lonzo continues to play as he has been playing this year, he might not."
Lamelo is slow shooting compared to lonzo in his last year with the lakers. He would catch the ball from the ref at his waist and shoot it in one continuous movement
"Despite missing 17 games, Lamelo Ball is still #1 in VORP in his class.  Advanced stats are not perfect but I think that it shows what I already believe which is: I'd rather have Lamelo for 48 games then Edwards for 65.  For those interested, Tyrese is #2 and Edwards is #49."
LaMelo seems more consistent of a scorer and while neither are a great defender LaMelo blows it away with his elite playmaking.   Any has had some nice games but I‚Äôd give it to Ball.

Has LaMelo Ball taken the title of ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù from Carmelo Anthony this quickly??
"If Anthony Edwards and LaMelo ball regress to playing like Kevin Knox and OKC Cameron Payne, sure  Jokes aside it‚Äôs always possible but I think Ant and LaMelo have more gifts physically but also have shown more star potential."
"Yeah but the amount of time each ref in each situation handles the ball is completely irrelevant to the point of the post.  The point is that comparing the two player's free throw routines (in which they *have the ball*, LaMelo makes two FT's before Giannis even puts his first one up.  If there was no cut in the first video, then what would be the point in including the ref handling the ball? What would it prove?"
"That‚Äôs not what you said.  You said in the time it took giannis to shoot one, Lamelo shot two.  That‚Äôs not what this shows. This just shows that lamelo is however much quicker to shoot once the ball is in his hands."
"He‚Äôs like an older, less flashy lamelo ball"
"&gt;Any tall PG with high intelligence, great passing, shooting range, flair, great handles and great rebounding like LaMelo has a chance to be a superstar like Luka. Yeah.  He averages 6 rebounds per game. That's barely more than Ant so I don't see this ""Great"" rebounding. Russ is a great rebounder,Harden is a great rebounder etc. LaMelo is average maybe above average for his position due to his height.  You also can't compare him to Doncic with his shooting because LaMelo is only a catch and shoot specialist meanwhile Doncic only had 43% of 3 point shots assisted in his rookie year. Doncic produced a great rookie season playing mostly by himself meanwhile LaMelo has had good teammates in Hayward,Rozier and Graham to make things easier for him and to take ball handling responsibilities when needed.   I never said he wouldn't be a good player or isn't a good player now but the intangibles that Luka has are what showed his top 5 potential. He lead his team from day 1. That's why its so hard to say for LaMelo or Ant or any rookie that they are a top 5 potential because you see it from day 1."
lol? He cuts it from when the ball goes in to when LaMelo gets the basketball again. Also not sped up but hey it must be tough to live a life in denial. Thinking of you...
I think OP was trying to cut out the ref handling the ball so that it was purely Lamelo possession vs giannis possession.
"It includes the parts where Lamelo has the ball. Thats the point, his free throw routine"

That announcer is going to sound great on the LaMelo Ball career highlights VHS tape that comes out at the height of his popularity.
Cant watch not available in your country but lamelo gotta be ROY and the best Ball brother
It was LaMelo for the majority of the season then he got hurt and Edwards became the front runner and then I don't think he will win over the two of them but I do want to mention Tyrese Haliburton has been pretty good and out of the three of them the most consistent.  Edwards has been erratic and his play has improved but it's happened to be when the Timberwolves have gone into tank mode and let him start chucking.  And I see all of the LaMelo Ball talk and I've been watching all season and I recognize the talent and creativity but I also see a kid who has a decent amount of holes in his game and I remember when they were taking him out of games in the fourth quarter when the game was on the line.  Both Edwards and Ball have the potential to be really great players in this league but I have to point out that right now both have quite a few wart's in their game.  While Haliburton doesn't have the long term potential as them he's been really good all season and steady. I don't think he's going to win but I do want to point out that for the duration of the season he's been the most consistent rookie this year.
"Ant has been great but he‚Äôs not one of the best rookie scorers of all time he‚Äôs not even top 25 in overall ppgs by a rookie and his consistency isn‚Äôt there to negate that, and efficiency has a lot to with proficiency  Add in per 36/100 ant isn‚Äôt even the leading scorer in the class that would be quickley but he hasn‚Äôt played as many minutes so that can be skewed   But say you compare his per 36 min or 100 possessions to lamelo who‚Äôs played more similar minutes to ant, this isn‚Äôt to say lamelo is better or worse that‚Äôs another debate but this is just to highlight his scoring compared to other rookies and it would also cover comparing him to people his age as Lamelo is younger but both 19,  Per 36 Ant  21.1 ppg on   .403 fg%    .317% 3pt  19 FGA   Lamelo  19.8 ppg on .449 fg%     .368% 3pt   16.1 FGA  Per 100 Ant 27.7 ppg on 25 FGAs (shooting splits stay the same   Lamelo  26.8 ppg on 21.8 FGAs  Again This is not a lamelo vs ant debate but an all time rookie scorer and can also add context as to 19 year olds proficiency at scoring in the nba but you can see that per 100 ant averages .9 more ppg on over 3 less shots a game so it could be reasonable to argue statistically that per shot lamelo is the better scorer as it‚Äôs very similar totals on lower attempts   Now there are obviously flaws to viewing it In this way just like it‚Äôs flawed to look at ants numbers without context and the fact that ant has attempted over 500 more shots than the next rookie   Rookie fga leaders  Ant 1088,  Halliburton 619, Bey 576, Tate 569, Ball 550 (missed last month), Quickley 547  It‚Äôs just really difficult to substantiate the claim that ant is one of the best rookie scorers of all time a better case could be made for best teenage scorers of all time but then that runs into the issue of lamelos totals when put to per 36 and per 100 are roughly 1 point less on 3 less shots and when lamelo is shooting well over 33% so it‚Äôs statistically really probable that with the same attempts lamelo would make more   Ant has a lot of potential and he‚Äôs improving a lot and I‚Äôm so happy for wolves fans as they deserve to do well but to say he is one of the bets rookie scorers all time is a stretch one several levels   And again before wolves fans come at me this is not about lamelo vs ant it‚Äôs about showing that it‚Äôs not realistic to say that stuff about ant as good as he has been and could be he just simply is not what OP claims him to be in any way that‚Äôs able to be proven with empirical evidence"
"Everyone always throws out the phrase ""gather step"" and all it does is convolute an extremely simple rule.  A player is allowed 2 steps after they no longer have a live dribble. There are 2 ways to kill your dribble. If you either two hand the ball or place your hand under it (or palm it so technically 3 ways) the dribble is no longer live and you have 2 steps to work with. In this video, from the point lamelo 2 hands the ball he takes two steps.  Players (such as The Beard) have gotten so good at killing their dribble simultaneously right as they're planting their foot that it makes casuals scream travel just because it happens so quickly. I'm not calling you a casual but that was definitely me venting my frustration with how quick some people are to condemn a player or ref when they just don't understand a rule."
I love lamelo ball. Hornets are absolute must see tv
"Oh, a SPECTACULAR move by LaMelo Ball!"
"if a Ball is starting its def Lonzo on this team, but LaMelo would be a 6MOTY contender"
"Lol wtf.  Steph and Giannis alone is crazy, add Jrue, Lamelo/Lonzo and either Brook or Marcus/Markieff as a small ball center for the starting lineup + a good bench is easily championship contender."
Lamelo Ball will end up being an upgraded Teodosic
Pistol pete wasn't even playing college ball yet at lamelos age. Throw lamelo into the college game for the next 3 years and see what he can average lol
"He shouldn't it's Magic's name when people say Magic nobody thinks Luka Doncic they think Magic Johnson. 2 years that's a long time, Magic Johnson has been Magic for 47 years. Luka deserves his own nickname because he is his own player. What's next are we going to call Zion King Z? Ja The Answer Morant? LaMelo The Truth Ball? Pistol Trey Young? Julius Dr. J Randle? The legends of the game deserve to be respected."

"years ago because i am soft internet boy, i made a comment about how lamelo/lonzo would both be all-nba within 10 years of the league... was -600 karma at the time lmao and i deleted it, but that snakeskin #2 ball jersey sits in my closet with my BBB shoes and i'm close to shedding a tear as between Lonzo's 33/11/8/3 tonight and Melo's underhand pass, I am vindicated dashboard confessional style"
"I think Pistol Pete is a great comp for the lamelo ball the kid is a bucket as well he's averaging like 20 as a starter Pistol Pete averaged 23 as a rookie but took a few more shots and the game was a bit faster pace as a whole. Let's not forget lamelo is the same guy that dropped 92 as a tenth grader on his brother's senior night LOL yeah he's a great playmaker but he's different from somebody like Lonzo or Jason Williams, he has an offensive bag a lot of guys don't. Right now I think he's limiting himself is a scorer to respect the older players on the Hornets. But if Melo hits a 3 from 25 the next trip down the floor he's shooting it from 32 squish or air ball lol I could see him three or four years from now flirting with averaging 30."
[Why LaMelo Ball WILL NOT make the NBA!! LAMELO BALL RUINED BASKETBALL!](https://youtu.be/ZEUmxQA_520)
"Lamelo ball has won more rookie of the month awards than any other rookie and its rookie of the year, as in who was the best rookie all year, so it‚Äôs only logical that the player with more awards for being the best rookie that month would be rookie of the year, plus betting odds have lamelo as the favorite"
"with their first round draft selection, the green bay packers select Lamelo Ball (charlotte hornets/lithuania)"
"I'd say that people start to have some animosity against Edwards simply because they prefer Ball and have to downgrade everything he does. Of course it goes both ways as Ant's fans will be more negative against LaMelo, but what can you do; at the end of the day, we're just imperfect humans."
Averaging 4.5 rebound when only .8 rebounds are offensive is decent for a rookie but Lamelo is averaging 6 and has been averaging 7 since becoming a starter isn‚Äôt great. Lamelo isn‚Äôt the 7th worst TS% in the nba. He‚Äôs not even in the 30 worst actually. Lamelo ball is shooting 7% better from 3. And it‚Äôs all year not since the allstar break. Lamelo is 5% better from the field. If you really want to use splits use Lamelo‚Äôs splits as a starter where he averages 22/7/7 on like 50%. I said edwards shooting is awful. He would be the most inefficient roty of all tim on his 50% TS. I‚Äôm using all stats. Your neglecting how bad his shooting is. Your pulling up empty stats. Using splits without the full story.
43% fg and 33% from 3. Still horribly inefficient. He‚Äôs one of the most inefficient rookies in the past few years. That‚Äôs not to say he will be bad because I think he will be a perineal allstar. Lamelo ball was shooting 45% fg and 38% from 3. Anthony edwards is supposed to be the shooter too. Lamelo is supposed to be the magic/chris Paul type guy but he is shooting way better than edwards.
"This is a Lamelo ball thread. I‚Äôve commented twice on this thread. The same amount as you actually. This is roty isn‚Äôt it? Not rookie of some good game and plenty of bad ones. I pulled up stats because that‚Äôs how nba awards work. You pick the most impactful, best storyline, best stats player for roty. You want edwards as roty show me the facts to why he should be. Just like how I pointed out how inefficient he is"
"I genuinely don‚Äôt care.  Both Ant and Ball have a solid case and I couldn‚Äôt be happier that both of them look great.    But for betting purposes, there are basically 4 half seasons here to consider.    Pre all star Ant:  14.9/4.0/2.5 on .466 TS% with terrible defense   Post all star Ant: 22.9/5.3/3.0 on .542 TS% with 25 games in a row with 1+ steals (3rd all time for a rookie).    Pre all star Ball: 15.8/6.0/6.3 on .561 TS%   Post all star Ball: 16.5/4.8/5.0 on .565 TS%....over 6 games.  What you‚Äôre really betting on is how well LaMelo will play coming back from injury, and how well Minnesota plays to close it out.  It‚Äôs real easy for Ball to drop those stats with a few bad games when you‚Äôve only played 6.  But if Ball plays well coming back, he‚Äôs going to win baring a ridiculous explosion from Ant (a 50 point game or a 30 point triple double goes a long way here).  My money is on Ball, but I do think those are good odds for Ant.  Color me biased."
"Stats shows Ant should be the ROTY no doubt but sadly, it's the media/fans who dictates who will win it which they leaning so hard on lamelo since he is very entertaining PLUS a BALL."
Lamelo because of his b-ball IQ

Lonzo Ball  Lavar Ball   LiAngelo Ball  LaMelo Ball  Lil‚ÄôDicky Ball
"Charlotte Hornets, Lamelo Ball MVP, Lavar becomes commissioner"
"I mean LaMelo Ball was said to have generational upside if his shot translated, which so far it is . Considering he's having a historic rookie season , you can't just brush off current production in favor of the unknown.  As of right now there's no reason to assume anyone in the 2021 class will be better than LaMelo."
I'd love to see the Hornets get into the play-offs. They are going to be a fun team to watch for years to come with LaMelo Ball as their franchise player.
"Now Brian, you're arguing that Saddiq Bey should be rated higher than Lamelo Ball but you're arguing that Lamelo Ball should be the rookie of the year."
My fellow media brethren should feel ashamed for rating Saddiq Bey over LaMelo Ball
"Both teams have a top 30-35 player in hayward and trae, top 50 players in john collins, terry rozier and lamelo ball is fringe top 50, so yeah both very deep teams."
"How have Ball and Halliburton been given the keys? Even Edwards is kind of a stretch. Lamelo is sharing with Hayward, Rozier and Graham. The Kings are still completely in Fox‚Äôs hands with a dash of Hield. The Wolves run thru KAT although Ant has been getting more lately."
Hornets also have a ton of guys who can shoot and attack the rim.  Lamelo is in a great situation there.  He wouldn't have been putting up similar numbers on the Warriors trying to pass the ball to Draymond/Paschall/Oubre/Wiggins for open jumpers.
Joe Ingles? LaMelo Ball? Patty Mills? Stephen Jackson?  Honestly this take is so incredibly weak.
"Third Team: Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Shaq  Fourth Team: Steph Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis  Fifth Team: Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball, Jason Tatum, Zion Willamson, Bam Adebayo"
"This is just me speculating, but I don't think there's a chance in hell, even if LaMelo was the higher rated prospect, that an old school guy like Kerr would take him.   I mean now he would, he's not an idiot, but he's got a little Popovich in him (""we like guys who've gotten over themselves,"" etc) and I would've been surprised if they took Ball at the time unless it was to trade him."
"Tier 1: Boban  Highest grossing actor and most minutes played by anyone over 7'3 in the last 5 years, so this is an obvious choice  Tier 2: Bojan, Bogdan, LeBron  Three prolific shooters with a shared 4 rings, 4 MVPs, 17 all star and 17 all NBA selections. SJ2 might propel LeBron into tier one, but we'll have to wait to see the earnings release  Tier 3: Furkan, Goran, Bertans, Draymond  Self explanatory  Tier 4: Lamelo and Lonzo (Ball)  Can't leave these two off any top list plain and simple"
"Dude played a full season of pro ball against grown men. Wiseman didn't even get to do training camp because he got Covid. There's a massive gap in experience between the two. Also, no one expected Lamelo to be the starter level player he proved himself to be at the draft, at least not this soon."
 &gt;he isn‚Äôt really the best fit for the Warriors offense  Of course he isn't because LaMelo Ball is.
Do I need to quote you again?   ‚ÄúLaMelo Ball had been the #1 talent guy in the draft for months‚Äù
You do realize I was specifically pointing out that he was not ranked as the top rank talent right? That was Anthony Edwards. Your direct quote:   ‚ÄúLaMelo Ball had been the #1 talent guy in the draft for months‚Äù

"I was like 7th ish man and it was senior night, so I got a chance to start. We were blowing out this other team by like 50 so all the scrubs got to play in the 4th quarter. Usually, I‚Äôm just the guy who stands in the corners who shoots 3s or sets screens, but at that moment I got to bring up the ball. I hit one regular pull up 3, then looked at my friend on the bench who reminded me about the Lamelo shot. The next play, I was bringing up the ball and chucked that boy and it banked in. Literally began jumping for joy. Good times ;)"
Wiseman was never over ball   Mocks had him going 1st cause it was clear the warriors favored him   LaMelo Ball had been the #1 talent guy in the draft for months
"Went through Charlotte‚Äôs roster and totally overlooked Lamelo ‚ÄúMelon‚Äù Ball and Hair Jordan, sad!"
&gt;	The wiseman pick in itself is questionable when there is lamelo ball on the board  This is hindsight bias because that was not the prevailing belief going into that pick lol
"Hindsight is 20/20. I liked LaMelo but he had real red flags. His shooting was terrible in Australia, his shooting form was wonky, his defensive effort was really questionable, and he may have intentionally botched his draft interview because he didn't want to play in GS. Add in the Ball family drama and the fact that Lonzo was way over hyped and it's totally reasonable for the Warriors to have doubts about LaMelo.  Wiseman is a project, but almost anyone who's watched all of his games this season will tell you he's probably going to be really good in a few years."
"Coaches go through slumps just like anyone else. Celtics have been coached terribly for awhile. We have a bunch of great athletes, yet we literally STOP fast breaks to run set plays. Celtics offense is an ugly, dated slog.  We have mobile husky bois &amp; a cat-quick former all star PG, yet we never run Kemba off ball over multiple screens like every other modern team to get him open. Kemba just isos sometimes with no momentum after Tatum ISOd the last 3 plays,or he gets a pass late in the clock to take a contested 3 or a scrambled drive attempt. Kemba takes a lot of crap but he is not being used the way he should.  Jaylen is an explosive athlete who has been working on his handle while driving all season which is good for his development and all, but they literally stop him from running on fast breaks, and we don't use him as a decoy on the baseline and let him hunt for open spots reactively and play off ball as a defense breaker even though he's literally a genius with incredible quickness.  If JT doesn't score 40, it's a freaking crapshoot that our offense can manage the game and win. While we played early 00s ISO-heavy offense with nobody moving or setting screens, the Hornets looked like the 2015 Warriors against us the other night. Playing modern, reactive basketball... and they were missing LaMelo AND Gordon Hayward. Celtics are NOT coached well at all rn"

"Yep! He was the runaway favorite before the injury that was thought to be season needing which just adds to his story since he‚Äôll prolly pass the min % of games played for Roy, and even tho ant has been great since post all star but he hasn‚Äôt done enough to steal it considering his first half, and Halliburton just hasn‚Äôt taken off enough to take it either    Source for betting odds: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10001790-lamelo-ball-betting-favorite-to-win-2021-nba-roy-over-anthony-edwards-despite-injury"
"The hornets are far from a stereotypical bad team even without lamelo Gordon and monk. They are extremely well coached a pretty deep, not to mention sharing the ball and playing like they do it‚Äôs so hard to guard, 40 assists on 47 made shots iirc"
"I mean, people also think Warriors dropped the ball in not trading these assets already. The Wiseman pick in itself is questionable when there is LaMelo Ball on the board."
So you think that if you give Lamelo ball that team they take prime Cavs Lebron to game 7 in the ECF and gentleman‚Äôs sweep the Sixers?
Maybe but it still doesn‚Äôt make sense. I would never draft Halliburton at 2 but I‚Äôd be depressed as hell If I knew I could‚Äôve had a lamelo ball and curry duo and perfectly transitioned into the next decade with a franchise player
You could‚Äôve had a 6‚Äô8 generational talent in lamelo ball and your sad about Tyrese Halliburton????
"Ok, harden in 2015 was the second highest scorer in the league. Donovan mitchell is 11th this year. You‚Äôre committing the same error people make when they compare true shooting percentages across eras. A lot has changed in basketball since warriors mania.   I never said Donovan mitchell will not improve, but there are a lot of players that are also young that are more likely to be the next generation of ‚Äúsuper stars.‚Äù Luka and giannis are already superstars. Zion already seems more likely to be a super star than mitchell. To name a few others, we got Devin booker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, and then a few more that I really think will be better even though there‚Äôs not a lot to go on I.e. lamelo ball and Michael Porter jr. Not to mention there will be more and more players pouring into the league, other guys that improve as well like maybe Anthony Edwards, and some current super stars that are still decently young like Anthony Davis and will be taking up those spots for the next while in Mitchell‚Äôs career.   Basically, I don‚Äôt really believe mitchell will ever be a borderline top 5 player and I actually believe he‚Äôll probably stay at around 15-20 for most of his career  Edit: ad is actually 28, but there‚Äôs others like jokic that are 26 and will be considered better than mitchell for like the next 6 to 8 years probably"
Even Lavar Ball said that LaMelo was always the more talented one out of the 3 brothers
"Why is this still being asked? I understood this question a couple months ago, but Ant has been ballin since the all star break and there are very few wolves fans who still think he was the wrong choice. Lamelo might technically be better at this moment, but with the way Ant has been playing lately that isn't even a given anymore. I think Lamelo will obviously improve and I'm sure he'll be an all star. But Ant is a freak athlete and is built like a grown-ass vet. He's proven everyone wrong who thought he wouldn't work hard or didn't care enough about basketball. He's shown a killer instinct late in games and has single handedly won us a couple. Advanced stats show that he's one of the worst defenders in the league, but he's shown flashes of being an absolute lockdown defender on-ball, and his off ball defense will improve as he gets more coaching. Ant has shown the potential to be not only an all star, but a bona-fide super star MVP candidate type of player. Anyone who is still asking this question hasn't been watching wolves games lately"
Hopefully this leads to the national media acknowledging the existence of the hornets not named lamelo ball they have an awesome young core all of them deserve love
lamelo ball
"Kuminga was the #1 prospect in this class and a projected #1 pick before he reclassified. Green was also #1 on some recruiting sites by the end of his senior season and also had some #1 pick hype behind him. Foster is projected as a early 2nd rounder from the 2022 ESPN mock draft, while Hardy is Top 3. Wouldn‚Äôt really put Foster in that same group as Kuminga and Green. One prospect the G League is going after who could help this class have two lottery picks is Ousmane Dieng, who‚Äôs a young French prospect choosing between the G League Ignite and NBL. Off topic, but I think a case like Dieng is really what the G League is trying to exist for. The Ignite isn‚Äôt trying to replace college ball. it‚Äôs just NBA teams trying to keep the kids who previously went overseas or had NCAA troubles (LaMelo, RJ, Wiseman, Bazley, etc.) in an easier scouting environment."
By little kids he means Trae Young and Lamelo Ball
"Steph, Prime Melo, White Chocolate, prime Vince Carter, unironically LaMelo Ball, prime Derrick Rose"
"It's true. We do love basketball here like literally a good chunk of NBA players were either born in GA or grew up here.  Even the GaTech games are lit. We couldn't attend games this year even tho we won the ACC but man the atmosphere is wild. And so are the after parties.  Also, with GaTech winning the ACC you'd hope that ATL will attract more talent to play college ball.   I feel like if we had the luck to draft AntMan or LaMelo, we would have got WAY more media attention than we currently are. I think it all comes down to ""Star Players"". That's the reason I feel like ATL folks support teams like Lakers because they have all the attention-grabbing stars. Trae is obviously a star and there are so many other worthy guys on this team. We're almost built like the Jazz imo. I do have a very optimistic feel for this franchise though. I think the future is bright."
There was no telling James Harden was even going to be traded until he demanded one and started tanking mid games.   That‚Äôs still not mentioning Kyrie goading about how clutch both he and KD were and proceeding to miss several clutch shots to ice a game vs freaking Lamelo Ball.
That's the point tho. They need players who can contribute now. Someone like lamelo ball who can contribute now at the same time has a high ceiling instead of Wiseman.
MVP - Joel Embiid  MIP - Julius Randle  COTY - Quinn Snyder  6MAN - Jordan Clarkson  ROTY - LaMelo Ball
"LaMelo Ball and Trae Young did that. They‚Äôre good, but are they as good as Steph?  Seriously, Steph has genetics, training and an IQ that allow him to do what he does. Just because he‚Äôs not a freak like specimen like Gobert doesn‚Äôt mean its simply a matter of ‚Äúpractice till you shoot like Steph freaking Curry‚Äù lol"
"Love talking about form. I've personally changed my form many times throughout high school, depending on which senior I wanted to emulate the most. I hate my left thumb with a passion lol  I think one reason for this trend is that basketball camps for younger kids don't have a block of time focused on form. While the old mentality was ""this is the best form, everyone do this"", the new mentality is ""do whatever you want, just perfect YOUR form"".  This might sound boomer of me, but I'm only 21. When I went to basketball camps in middle school, the first 15-20 minutes every day was dedicated to one hand shots at close range. We would focus on our follow through, high arc, and swishing every shot. BEEF was the way to go. UBC T-Birds camp btw.  The best example in my opinion is pre-NBA Lonzo Ball. No semblance of old-school proper form except maybe his feet alignment. But he kept that form from a young age and developed his own game around his shooting mechanics. That left step back that he was famous for at UCLA? 100% unstoppable because the defender had to go across his body to contest it, and by that point there's a good chance of a foul.  Even Trae Young and other chest-shooters like Lamelo Ball. Release is too low for the old school way of thinking. Right elbow isn't 90¬∞ at all. But he developed his step back and quick release to accomodate for his easier-to-block shot.  I think it's changed for the better. We get to see way more innovation in how players move on the court. Sure, there's picture perfect players like Klay Thompson, but the fact that his form is so textbook makes him stand out even more."
All you need to know is Lonzo Ball and LaMelo Ball
"Lol why are you limiting historic to the past three seasons??   This year Lamelo has been:  1.	‚Å†The youngest player to record a triple double. 2.	‚Å†The youngest player to make 7 threes in a game. 3.	‚Å†One of three rookies to make 7 threes and dish 10 assists in a game 4.	‚Å†Only rookie in the last 60 years to lead all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals heading into the all-star break. 5.	‚Å†One of three NBA players age 20 or younger to have multiple 20/10/5 games (the other two being Lebron James and Luka Doncic). 6.	‚Å†One of three rookies to record 7 threes and 10 assists in a game (the other two being Steph Curry and Jason Kid). 7.	‚Å†One of two rookies to average 15/5/5 and 2 threes (the other rookie being Luka Doncic). 8.	‚Å†Per 36, one of two rookies to post 18/6/6 for a season (the other being a Oscar Robertson; less impressive if he doesn‚Äôt play again this year).  That is literally the definition of historic my guy lmfao.   [This article does a pretty good job putting his season into perspective](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fansided.com/2021/03/03/nylon-calculus-comparing-lamelo-ball-greatest-nba-rookies-ever/amp/)  I know u want your guy to win but saying Lamelo wasn‚Äôt having a historic season? Come on now lol"
"&gt;Despite missing the past 17 games with a fractured right wrist, Charlotte Hornets guard LaMelo Ball remains the **betting favorite** to win the 2021 NBA Rookie of the Year Award.  Not trying to sound salty but come on. I'd at least give it some credit if it said the media again voted him top."
"My favorite player is LeBron, and I've liked him ever since he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine like 20 years ago. But I would advise you not to be a LeBron stan.  Here's some young and exciting players that I love to watch:   \- **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City** \- Crafty young point guard with an all-around skillset   \- **Lamelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets** \- Great passer and playmaker, and still super young   **- Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies -** Explosive athlete, a point guard who plays above the rim   **- Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings -** Smooth, reliable guard who plays like a veteran  Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Zion Williamson, and Trae Young are all really good and young, but they already get lots of fanfare."
No one cares about Denver or Utah or whatever team he‚Äôs on. For that reason he shouldn‚Äôt get MVP. Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn‚Äôt understand basketball. It should be Westbrook or Lamelo ball hands down.

Lol basketball casuals talking about 17-0 fts. Yall probably don‚Äôt watch or even hoop. One team drives and one team shoots. What do you expect? Yall probably know everything about basketball from bleacherreport and houseofhighlights and think lamelo ball is the goat. When dude played only 50 games and has 145 turnovers on the season

"&gt;just this year alone the hype already trimmed by a lot and goes to lamelo ball  NBA has always been like this, they run to the next new shiny rookie every season. Watch them forget about Lamelo and fawn over Cade Cunningham next year"
Am I crazy or does MPJ kinda look like LaMelo Ball?  Face wise
He's not Lamelo Ball.
"Man that Wiseman pick was really baffling, especially with the reports that [Warriors promised Lamelo](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/09/warriors-nba-draft-promise-lamelo-ball/) they‚Äôd draft him, Lamelo [indicating he was going 2](https://youtu.be/oKo6U3B6RVg) on draft night, and then even after Klay‚Äôs injury they still took Wiseman.   Warriors seem to be trying to rebuild AND compete at the same time. It‚Äôs so dumb, that‚Äôs how you end up in mediocrity.   My question to you is, what trade targets do you see the Warriors targeting in the off-season? Would you accept a Jerami Grant + Plumlee deal for Wiseman + filler + Minny pick? Grant is an elite 2 way forward putting up 23 ppg and Plumlee would fit the Warriors system really well with his Jokic-lite passing"
"Yeah my experience is probably somewhat skewed because I don‚Äôt follow or even watch college ball.  Based on what happens to cross my path, I see more hype over high school prospects like lamelo, Zion, bronny, etc than I do over any college hoopers. Staying in college more than one year is basically a downvote on a players resume. It means that player has limited upside. I do think we‚Äôll be seeing more and more US players skipping ncaa like international players already do."
**Starters**  Steph Curry   Jrue Holiday   Justin Holiday   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Brook Lopez    **Bench**    LaMelo Ball   Marcus Morris   Seth Curry   Robin Lopez   Markieff Morris   Thanasis Antetokounmpo   Kostas Antetokounmpo    **Coaching staff**   Mike D'antoni   Dan D'antoni
I think having Lamelo be the primary ball handler off the bench helps maximize use of his skills and gives the bench a better lead guard than Lonzo would be.
Maybe they‚Äôll take 2 more Wiseman like picks and leave LaMelo Ball like players on the board.
"""Ja Morant can't shoot, Ja Morant overrated, I'd rather have Lamelo Ball over Ja Morant"" BLAH BLAH BLAH BLA-FUCKIN-BLAH. Put some respect on homie name and stop fucking playin."
Anybody else watching Australian steams see that documentary commercial with Lamelo Ball and RJ Hampton? I wanna see that
"I think though some of that is the novelty of the G-League prospects system. If Green and Kuminga ball out and in retrospect look like they should have been picked higher, teams will start looking at the G-League guys differently. Playing in an atypical environment adds to the risk profile because that's another variable you have to account for, and tbh I feel like with these top-ish draft picks, GMs are often trying not to fuck up than hit the big homerun. Ayton/Bagley vs Luka or Ant vs LaMelo."
1. Jimmer Fredette (hometown boy)  2. Kemba Walker  3. LaMelo Ball  4. Dirk Nowitzki   5. Kevin Love  6. Luka Doncic  7. Miles Bridges   8. Hakeem Olajuwon   9. Nikola Jokic    10. Devonte Graham
"I get you don't want to roast rookies, but I think Wieseman was the least valuable player on a team that had playoff intentions.  I get he's young and didn't get to play in college, but his performance was really bad and way worse then Lamelo or Edwards.  Not sure whar the logic was of drafting a raw big w a lottery pick on a win now team, other then warriors needed an upgraded at center so greens not doing small ball 5 in the regular season.  But as we've seen centers come cheap in 2021."
Even more for that to show how much more it can be: Only nine degrees of separation between LaMelo Ball and Pittsburgh Ironmen low-bench player Joe Fabel (the worst player on the worst team from the first season of the NBA.)
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"In the above quotes, he talks about the ""baseline threshold of availability"", I think it's safe to say Ball is over it and Embiid was under. Not particularly hypocritical.   I guess the judgement you have to make is who made the bigger impact across the time they played. I think Edwards' extra availability makes up for any performance gaps, but I won't rail on somebody for picking LaMelo."
"In Lowe's defence, LaMelo played 51/72 games (equivalent to 58 in a full season) versus Embiid's 31/82. Ball missed games, Embiid missed most of the season."
LaMelo Ball and Anthony Edwards will each finish with 4. Two will be together on the 2032 and 2033 Lakers.
LaMelo Ball  Bismack Biyombo  Gerald Wallace  Jerry Stackhouse  Michael Jordan  Dave Greenwood  Roger Brown  Wilt Chamberlain  Ernie Beck  Freddie Lewis  Charlie Parsley
Norm baker to lamelo ball is 9 also and uses the one year tony parker was in charlotte. It almost felt like cheating
Norm baker gets to lamelo ball through tony parkers year on the hornets
"Tacko fall, bol bol, lamelo ball, Lonzo ball, Grayson allen"
Got 9 with Lou Spicer-Lamelo Ball
"Horrific post. The Hornets also lost their best player Hayword during that 3-7 stretch. Also Lamelo is clearly good, the problem from what I've watched is he's often out there  with ineffective bigs who clog lanes and don't contribute. Get this team a rim runner, a wing defender, and maybe another bigger shooter and you will see how much more effective an already good Lamelo Ball is."
Don Otten to Lamelo Ball is 8 - anyone got higher?
Boom! 9 degrees!  LaMelo Ball and Nat Frankel.  I am done now. 10 anyone?
"Damn I didn‚Äôt even think about that, that would be insane lmao.  The ball movement with him and Draymond would be nice to see  And that‚Äôs a big ass backcourt of LaMelo Klay and Wiggins"
"LaMelo Ball to George Mikan, eight degrees."
6 degrees between LaMelo Ball and Bill Russell lmao
There‚Äôs only 5 degrees of separation between Lamelo Ball and Kareem Abdul-Jabar  Really thought it‚Äôd be more
Two teammates separate Michael Jordan and Lamelo Ball.  Three teammates separate Anthony Edwards and Lamelo Ball. LOL
What‚Äôs the most separations that y‚Äôall can get?   I max out at 8 each time with an early pioneer and a rookie(Leo Mogus and Lamelo Ball)
Lol this is dope. Eight degrees of separation between George Mikan and LaMelo Ball
But I do. The topic is ROTY. I‚Äôm not giving reason for anyone to win ROTY. I‚Äôm giving facts regarding Hornets winning and losing with and without LaMelo Ball. Nothing to do with the original topic. All to do with the first comment I responded to saying Hornets made the play-in making things favorable for LaMelo. I stated those facts because statistics show he had nothing to do with the play-in. Nice try though. Next time offer something to the discussion.

TIL Lamelo Ball is Carmelo Anthony
Every time LaMelo Ball writes his name he starts with 'Lame'. Think about *that*.
"Exactly, Klay was out. So why draft Wiseman and waste Curry‚Äôs year? Lamelo has obviously been the better player, he‚Äôs got generational talent. And it‚Äôs crazy to write the season off as lost before it even started, there was an entire off season to set this team up for success.    You know, Warriors actually [promised](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/09/warriors-nba-draft-promise-lamelo-ball/) Lamelo that they‚Äôd draft him. Lamelo even indicated on [IG Live](https://youtu.be/oKo6U3B6RVg) on draft night that he was going 2. Yet, even after news of Klay‚Äôs season ending injury, they still picked the extremely raw Wiseman. Now they‚Äôre probably trading Wiseman in the off-season... there‚Äôs no need to go through mental gymnastics to defend your organization. They fucked up with the pick, their strategy of ‚Äúrebuild and compete at the same time‚Äù is ridiculous. Curry‚Äôs having years of his prime, of MVP caliber performances, wasted. Wait until he retires to rebuild."
"Lamelo is much much more versatile than DLo. He can play 1-3 and has played minutes at the 2/3 this season and overseas. He isn‚Äôt simply an on-ball guard like Dlo, he makes runs and cuts and can play off ball very well, he‚Äôs a high IQ player that would fit Kerr‚Äôs system like a glove. Klay can play the 3 as well, and he‚Äôs been injured all season anyways. Taking Wiseman just made this a waste of a season, a waste of one of Curry‚Äôs prime years.   You should be in win-now mode, not trying to rebuild. Rebuilding happens AFTER Curry retires. Not now."
"It might be too early. I don't think so but it's fair to argue it's debatable. But no one thinks he's the next Luka, Ja Morant or LaMelo Ball. You want a player like Allen when they're still on their first contract. For cheap. And hopefully they become that star before it matures. He's not that guy yet and his contract is up. So I would sign him and trade him for assets. 3 young 19 year olds are better than Allen for the Cavs IMHO."
"Because they don‚Äôt need ‚Äúprospects‚Äù right now, this ‚Äúrebuild and compete at the same time‚Äù shit is fucking weird and won‚Äôt work. They need win-now moves. Curry is in his prime and you‚Äôre wasting his years to rebuild? There‚Äôs plenty of time to rebuild AFTER Curry retires. Klay was also injured before the draft happened, so it made perfect sense to pick Lamelo.   To make things even more confusing: Warriors actually [promised](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/09/warriors-nba-draft-promise-lamelo-ball/) Lamelo that they‚Äôd draft him. Lamelo even indicated on [IG Live](https://youtu.be/oKo6U3B6RVg) on draft night that he was going 2. Yet, even after news of Klay‚Äôs season ending injury, they still picked Wiseman. Absolutely baffling!"
"To make things even more confusing: Warriors actually [promised](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/09/warriors-nba-draft-promise-lamelo-ball/) Lamelo that they‚Äôd draft him. Lamelo even indicated on [IG Live](https://youtu.be/oKo6U3B6RVg) on draft night that he was going 2. Yet, even after news of Klay‚Äôs season ending injury, they still picked Wiseman. Absolutely baffling!"
"It's definitely a stat that needs context and &lt;gasp&gt; game-watching to provide that context. Look at some other names in the ""top"" 30 for players with highest TOV% and we see: Ben Simmons, Facundo Campazzo, Ricky Rubio, LaMelo Ball, Goran Dragic, Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, Ja Morant, LeBron James. What these guys all have in common is that they don't take many shots ***relative*** to how much ball handling they do. For sure a couple guys (Trae and LeBron especially) shoot and score a lot, but they do *even more* ball handling relative to their teammates."
It's also funny cause everyone is like it's because of the Lamelo fanbase when the Edwards posts outnumber Ball posts like ten to one.
"I'm just glad Edwards made the gap between him and Haliburton obvious.. start of the season we weren't so sure. Also Edwards tanking his stats playing without KAT/DLo wasn't very fun -- Ball doesn't look very great without Hayward around, though that could just be the wrist injury.   Either way I think any sane wolves fan knows LaMelo had this in the bag  if he never got hurt, that's my rationale for not caring too much about who wins it at least."
What‚Äôs so bad about my statement?    Westbrook needs triple doubles to stand out from the rest.   The other greatest players ever do not need triple doubles to stand out. The greatest point guards ever didn‚Äôt need rebounds to stand out.   Chris Paul is better than Westbrook.   Rondo is better than Westbrook.   Lamelo Ball is already better than Westbrook.   Curry is obviously better.
Surely you know by now that Lamelo Ball has a huge fan following even though he pays for a small market team.
"Prepare yourselves for year 2, when he inevitably has a few bad games and people start posting the ""Is Jalen Suggs better than LaMelo Ball?"" threads."
"Very much agreed about the cherry picked stats. I would have called it out myself if you hadn‚Äôt.   That said, this is what Ant fans have been seeing in reverse all year. There was an article from the Ringer a few weeks ago that used rookie stats to compare the top rookies from this class against historic rookies to ‚Äúproject‚Äù their ceiling. For Anthony, they chose his usage rate combined with his FG% and compared him to Dion Waiters, Coby White, and JR Smith. And then for Melo, they did some magic with his stats of like 15-5-5 to compare him to Luka, Trae, and Ja. It‚Äôs just infuriating to see the misrepresentation.   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/20/22393182/rookie-comps-lamelo-ball-anthony-edwards-tyrese-haliburton  *edited to correct typo"
"but the point of the play-ins is to determine who makes it into the playoffs  the hornets were eliminated in the play-in. hence, they did not make the playoffs. lamelo ball does not have a playoff appearance. he has not played in a playoff game. it does not make sense for that to be true *and* for him to have playoff stats."
"""This far"" 10th in the east and a blowout loss to the pacers? Like im not saying the wolves were secretly good but the Lamelo ball is a winning player arguement is pretty clearly not true right now."
"The setting for the ant vs lamelo argument would also be different if we disregard injury.  Remember the hornets were a play off team before the ball and hayward injuries.  Yes swap ball and ant the results would be the same, they're both going to be stars in the league, but lamelo would have absolutely ran away with roty if it wasn't for injuries."
"Not exactly a great end to the season for CHA, especially since losing in this fashion is at least in part because of no Hayward(the ""why sign him to a max if he's gonna get hurt"" crowd is jerking themselves off), but ultimately it was a super successful season for the Hornets.  Hayward and Rozier are the steady vets, they have a good young player in LaMelo Ball, and their coaching staff has them playing hard even when the team is down players. There's a lot to be happy with if you're a CHA fan."
"I can just see the headlines tomorrow on ESPN  ""Is LaMelo Ball the ROTY still?""  ""Should the Hornets trade Terry Rozier?"""
"&gt;  the media has been judging Lamelo Ball only on his best 51 games of the season, and not the full 72 games  ...because he only played 51 games. You're wording this like the media are ignoring 21 bad games or something"
"Reddit is full of dumb fuckers who overrate rookies then throw a third-grade level tantrum when they aren‚Äôt always good. Ant got it first, then Wiseman, now it‚Äôs Melo‚Äôs turn. These guys are too young to fully evaluate, can we take a breather? I mean, shit, LaMelo Ball probably has a middle ground between G-League Jason Williams and Luka Doncic with flair."
LaMelo Ball holds the record for worst +/- in *Play In Tournament* history with -35.
Anthony edwards and lamelo ball would be a nasty backcourt
"Not even a meme. And that's not to discredit Lamelo's year, if he had not been injured he would've locked up ROTY. BUT Ant has absolutely flipped a switch since All-Star break and deserves the Award. It's seriously sad to see Ant getting absolutely demolished in ROTY voting so far, it's like 17-Ball and 3-Ant right now.  Even if you believe Lamelo deserves it more than Edwards, for it to be an absolute landslide like this is absurd."
"Most wolves fans don't want Lamelo to do poorly. I personally love watching Ball hoop too, and all the hype he's gotten is absolutely deserved. But I do think most Wolves fans wish Ant got the hype he deserves too, which he absolutely has not gotten this spring."
Lamelo could be the worst Ball in the NBA.
"It seems like it‚Äôs really easy for people to say ‚ÄúAnthony Edwards was terrible for first half of the season‚Äù yet he was still putting up points that being the efficiency wasn‚Äôt great but it was still about the same as LaMelo‚Äôs TS.  He also was much better for a longer period of time, ever since Ant was promoted as a starter he started averaging 21.3 PPG (55 games) on decent efficiency and he was even better as soon as finch took over as he finished the season averaging 23.5 PPG in his final 40 games on solid efficiency.   It seems like the argument used against Edwards actually favours him more. Clearly LaMelo ball was pretty bad for most of the season besides a 20 game stretch where as Ant was only bad during earlier in the season which onto consisted of 30 games or so and even if you want to say more it‚Äôs still less than how bad LaMelo was in his season.  **Anthony Edwards also finished his rookie season leading with 535 more total points (7.4 PPG average in a 72 game season for context) than the next rookie while also finishing top 5 in total assists, rebounds and steals among rookies.**"
"The ""future of the league"" Lamelo Ball rocking that sweet ""more turnovers than both made field goals and assists"" stat line."
1/7 -32‚Ä¶man Lamelo Ball is going to get clowned after the game  Nicknames are already popping up:   Lafraud  Lmao Ball
Where‚Äôs Lamelo Ball?   I get he‚Äôs coming off an injury early and he‚Äôs a rookie.  Hopefully this game gives him ideas on what to work on for next year.
"Terry was a ball stopping nightmare, lamelo might have the worse looking box score, but terry has higher expectations."
LaMelo Ball has been demoted to team janitor
LaMelo Can't Score The Ball
"Lamelo is the best rookie in the league, PJ is a solid center for small-ball, Terry is a 45%+ shooter on 39% from 3, Jalen McDaniels has been electric since coming up, Bridges is solid on both sides, and the Martins/Monk provide good depth. Purely off of talent, Charlotte is a better team than Indy/Washington, even without Heyward. They've been getting outcoached. Don't know why you thought you knew more about the team than someone whos followed them all year lmfao"
LaMelo jumping up n down for the ball    Ball handler: I have tunnel vision
lamelo yelling for the ball damn
Look at lamelo waving his arms around for the ball tho
"so you *clearly* either didn‚Äôt watch Hornets games both last year &amp; this year or you simply don‚Äôt understand what team culture means.  and as far as record and win percentage goes, they went from a .354 team last year to above .500 when both LaMelo and Hayward played. they both contributed to the team‚Äôs success. i don‚Äôt think that without LaMelo this team even scratches the play-in tournament, despite their 5-2 record with Hayward and without Ball."
lamelo ball more like lasmello because he stinks amirite  haha just kidding he's gonna be fine
"To be fair, LaMelo is 19. Which is insanely young. I figured his playing style wouldn't translate to the gritty, physical playoff-type ball.  I was a doubter when he was drafted but I see a bright future. (not actually watching to save data, just glancing at box score)"
Has the so called future star of the league and ROTY LaMelo Ball played tonight?  Haven‚Äôt noticed
"Three sloppy turnovers, multiple defensive breakdowns, and a game-worst -26 +/- for LaMelo Ball in the first half."
Lamelo Ball has more playoff appearances than Zion and Lonzo combined.
"Hornets not playing together. They really need to be moving the ball more and moving as a whole on offense. Defense, idk what to say. Just saw Lamelo stick his hand out and run back on offense üòÇ"
Atleast 24 teams would kill to have LaMelo Ball on their team
"https://i.imgur.com/ChKqHH5.jpg Quick pic. It‚Äôs backboard L, backboard R, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies.  Backboards follow the ball, Pacers follows Sabonis, Grizzlies follow Lamelo"
Lamelo needs to get the ball way more.  Hes calling for it too
"Hornets are a better team with LaMelo on the bench.  Too much of a defensive liability, too sloppy with the ball, so inconsistent with his three that can be left open."
lamelo is ball is good but everyone who was solely attributing the hornets early success to him and not Gordon hayward only watched the highlights and not the actual games.
Lamelo Ball is in a constant state of hustle. Its really impressive and fun to watch
"Listening to ESPN Radio, got this idea:  Would a Ball brother Finals of Hornets (LaMelo)/Pelicans (Lonzo) be a draw? Would such a family reunion matchup compensate for the supposedly ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù media markets?"
"I‚Äôve watched him plenty. He‚Äôs totally come back to earth as a shooter. Edwards scores the majority of his points on catch and shoots and cutting to the basket, lamelo doesn‚Äôt play off the ball at all because he‚Äôs a below average shooter. And he‚Äôs not a better defensive player than Edwards in any way"
Lamelo does not need the ball at all times by any stretch. He doesn't play like Doncic or Trae. Watch his games.   He's also much better on defense than Edwards.
Where will you be when LaMelo Ball saves the NBA?
Lamelo‚Äôs problem is that he needs the ball to be effective and he‚Äôs a sieve on defense. When you already have KAT and D-Lo it‚Äôs hard to get the most out of lamelo without diminishing the effectiveness of your other two stars. Kat needs a lot of touches and D-Lo is bad off ball. Lamelo is in the perfect situation where the hornets let him do his showtime act and play his game. Not to mention Edwards has been the better player by a pretty decent margin in the second half of the season and still has so much room to grow
"I mean no slight on Ant, I think he's a star. I happen to be super high on LaMelo, think he would be a perfect match with KAT as well (think he would be a perfect match with virtually anyone tbh).   I think Ball is a guy who actually makes every single player on your team better/more effective and there are VERY few guys I think you can truly say that about. So I got Ball 1A but I can't hate on someone taking Ant as well. Both will be all star players so don't think there's really a wrong answer."
I don‚Äôt know why anyone would take Ball over Edwards #1 overall. Don‚Äôt get me wrong Ball has been very good but edwards has been insane the second half of the season and was more raw to begin with.   Lamelo gets extra praise in my opinion because he‚Äôs got that ‚Äúshowtime‚Äù vibe about him where he‚Äôs really fun to watch. I have no doubt that Edwards is more conducive to winning basketball than Lamelo is
"I actually feel its the opposite lol  Ant should (and imo will) win ROY due to games missed by LaMelo, but I'd still take Ball #1 overall in a redraft, though they're obviously the clear top 2 in this draft class after 1 season."
"Well Mortal Kombat only had seven characters:  Scorpion - Lebron (Always bringing other stars to play with him. ""GET OVER HERE!"")  Sub Zero - Russ (Ice in his veins. Also his 3-pt shot is ice cold)  Rayden - Steph (Enjoys fucking the sky)  Johnny Cage - Lamelo Ball (Showmanship!)  Liu Kang - Demar Derozan (Spams from mid-range)  Kano - Ja Morant (Real first name is Temetrius)  Sonya - Jason Tatum (Looks good in green)"
"People might. NBA GM's would not. Ball is being benched late. Edwards isn't. I think Ball is a good player, but Edwards' improvement is accelerating month by month. You can't say the same for LaMelo."
Hmm but we can‚Äôt say it takes time for Ant to adjust as well?  Even with no summer league and preparation.  At least LaMelo has pro ball prior to the NBA.  Again this just helps Edwards.
People I obsessed cause it slows the game down tremendously. When someone posted the video of Lamelo ball shooting 2 ft‚Äôs before Giannis even finishes his first (separate games playing the same nigh) I knew it was way too much. Players shouldn‚Äôt be moving twice as fast as you please speed it up

This is why I have always said TJ McConnel &gt; LaMelo Ball
"&gt; Hell, his brother got a bunch of D-1 offers as a freshman in order to reel in Marvin and ironically, Marcus might end up bette  This is basically the Ball family too.  UCLA promised all 3 of them a ride to get Lonzo.  They knew LiAngelo wasn't worth a scholarship and who could have known about LaMelo (he was like 13 then), but to them Lonzo was worth it.  Now LaMelo's clearly the better brother and funny enough he didn't even end up at UCLA!"
The pendulum always swings back. He'll be worse than Lamelo Ball by midseason.
Graham is a damn good all-around PG but isn't really that great of a scorer other than shooting 3s. Good passer and acceptable defense for a 6'1 guy. Plus he's like 26 already which makes him fairly expendable for a rebuilding team.  Monk is a very weird player but his potential is through the roof. He's insanely strong for a guard and seems to have finally developed a consistent shot. Also has shown to be an extremely creative passer the few chances he gets to be the primary ball handler. Both Clifford and Borrego have found ways to shaft him out of the lineup which is just bizarre considering he's always outperformed his spot in the rotation and the analytics nerds love him.  I've always criticized Terry but he's still a solid rotational player. At the 2 he's one of the premier catch and shoot guys in the league but don't expect much in the way of playmaking or defense. Definitely won't be sad about trading him though  As for Simmons I'd definitely get experimental and play him at the 4 or 5 with Lamelo/Rozier/Bridges/Washington. That's a lineup with excellent playmaking and deadly spacing
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they‚Äôd take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant"
They had a decent team in the early 90s with Alonzo Mourning but their issue is bad team management. Mitch Kupchak is looking like he‚Äôs putting the team in the right direction. LaMelo Ball is a franchise cornerstone. And Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier have been good pick ups.
"Lamelo and Draymond passing the ball to each other while Steph runs around trying to get open isn't winning you shit.     Lamelo passing to Mulder, Damion Lee, Looney ain't winning you shit either.  Those are the positions they need to improve."
"There was a weird case with the Warriors in the case of Lamelo Ball. Remember they thought they were going to have Klay Thompson for the seconds half of the season, so it makes sense to pass on a guard that would have to sit behind Steph, Klay for certain, likely Wiggins (since Lamelo is big enough to play SF), and if he didn't hit, even behind Poole or JTA. Especially when the best center on their team was a toss-up between Marquese Chriss and 6'8"" two-way player Omari Spellman. Let's not forget too that Wiseman is supposed to be able to play a bit on the perimeter."
"Curry doesn't need Lamelo to pass him the ball when they have Draymond.    Warriors need paint scoring, vertical spacing hence the Wiseman pick.  Warriors need a wing who can put the ball on the floor and create his own shot which they can get this draft.    Lamelo looks good in Charlotte because they have way more shooters and forwards than the Warriors who basically just had Curry last year."
"Yeah lmao we dropped from possibly having Ja Morant and LaMelo Ball to Darius Garland and Isacc Okoro. I love our young guys but that's a significant difference. A top 3 pick has a good chance of netting you a star, a 5 pick has a much better chance of getting you a good role player."
played this while doing something else and for a second I thought I heard Lamelo Ball
Any All-Star under like 27-28 and locked up for a few years is probably the list.  Maybe add Edwards or LaMelo Ball.
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12. Seth Curry 13. Pascal Siakam 14. Fred VanVleet 15. Zach Lavine 16. Nikola Vucevic 17. Jarret Allen 18. Colin Sexton 19. Jerami Grant 20. Domantas Sabonis 21. Malcom Brogdon 22. Giannis Antetokounpo 23. Khris Middleton 24. Jrue Holiday 25. Trae Young 26. Clint Capela 27. Lamelo Ball 28. Jimmy Butler 29. Bam Abedayo 30. Russel Westbrook 31. Bradley Beal 32. Nikola Jokic 33. Michael Porter Jr 34. Jamal Murray 35. Karl Anthony Towns 36. Deangelo Russel 37. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 38. Damien Lillard 39. CJ McCollum 40. Rudy Gobert 41. Donovan Mitchell 42. Steph Curry 43. Klay Thompson 44. Draymond Green 45. Paul George 46. Kawhi Leonard 47. Lebron James 48. Anthony Davis 49. Deandre Aston 50. Chris Paul  51. Devin Booker 52. Luka Doncic 53. Christian Wood 54. John Wall 55. Dearon Fox 56. Ja Morant 57. Dillon Brooks 58. Zion Williamson 59. Brandon Ingram 60. Demar Derozen  And that list really minimizes controversial choices.
&amp;#x200B;  In no particular order:  1. LBJ 2. KD 3. Curry 4. Klay 5. AD 6. Kyrie 7. Harden 8. Joker 9. Booker 10. Murray 11. CP3 12. Luka 13. Giannis 14. Leonard 15. Dame 16. Embiid 17. Randle 18. Beal 19. Butler 20. PG 21. Gobert 22. Middleton 23. Trae 24. Jaylon Brown 25. Jason Tatum 26. Westbrook 27. Sabomis 28. Oladipa 29. Malcom Brogdon 30. LaVert 31. Joe Harris 32. Scary Terry 33. Gordon Hayward 34. Lowry 35. FVV 36. Pascal Siakam 37. Sexton 38. Garland 39. Kevin Love 40. Jerami Grant 41. Donavan Mitchell 42. Deandre Ayton 43. Michael Porter Jr. 44. Norman Powell 45. CJ McCollum 46. Ja Morant 47. Zion Williamson 48. Ingram 49. LaMelo Ball 50. Lonzo Ball 51. D-Fox 52. KAT 53. Anthony Edwards 54. Malik Beasley 55. D-Lo 56. Shai 57. Al Horford 58. Christian Wood 59. John Wall 60. Kevin Porter Jr
"Lonzo Ball isn‚Äôt one of the most famous and successful athletes in the world. Lamelo was also much, much better at that age. Bronny is not very impressive considering how much attention he gets and how much bron stans stay with him firmly lodged deep in their throats."
Sign up LaMelo Ball with the Globetrotters and let 'em in!
"He is going to go home and sign with Charlotte and him , lamelo and bridges are gonna ball out üôè"
"On the other hand, lots of reports of LaMelo ball being apathetic and not a team player in Australia. Promptly forgotten"
"You‚Äôre massively underestimating the lack of give-a-fuck among NBA players. You don‚Äôt think a team with players like Cade Cunningham, Jalens Suggs and Green, Lamelo Ball, Evan Mobley, James Wiseman level players would win every game by 20? France, Australia, Canada etc have NBA-caliber players in the starting lineup. USA at any level has NBA-caliber players at the end of the bench. Give these kids a chance who haven‚Äôt won anything of note to compete on the world stage as Olympians and you‚Äôll see something special"
Hornets trading up getting Lamelo Ball a center
"Bismack Biyombo with the hands of literally any other NBA player.  LaMelo Ball with Ben Simmons defense.  Also, non Hornets player: Derrick Rose with prime Derrick Rose athleticism"
Haliburton and Bey played multiple years in college and LaMelo played pro ball last year. Dudes like Edwards and especially Wiseman didn't have nearly as much experience
Oh boy I‚Äôm going to have to look at this. I love Ball and I have been the last guy left on the believe in Simmons bandwagon. How things change in the nba  Edit you definitely deserve to bump that thread. One simple factor..the hate for Lavar Ball makes people give Lonzo and Lamelo less props and more criticism than they deserve
Trash trade for the Hornets  LaMelo is the PG of the future and he needs the ball. They also have Graham and Rozier  Also I don‚Äôt think Hayward and the Jazz like each other that much
"He really hasn‚Äôt improved honestly. His ‚Äúrookie‚Äù season and sophomore season were probably his best out of the 4, and he‚Äôs just straight regressed since. He can‚Äôt hit a jumper, he can‚Äôt shoot 3s, he can‚Äôt even shoot free throws now, yet the one thing he‚Äôs good at is getting to the rim and he can‚Äôt even do that now? Dude went from an All-Star to Bronny being better than him real quick. Like fuck I‚Äôd rather have LaMelo or Lonzo over him and I despise the ball brothers."
"Hornets are looking to trade Hayward. I'd love to see Lamelo and Simmons in a fast break style offense. Hornets get a fun exciting team while they're not ready to contend yet. Also Simmons has to give up playing point, that's just not his position. He's a PF/small ball 5."
"That‚Äôs disrespect to lamelo ball, who is already a better player than summons  At the rate he‚Äôs going Ben is gonna be lianglo soon"
"Why is everyone relating this garbage ass performance to LeBron in 2011? We gotta stop comparing Ben to LeBron, LaMelo Ball by the end of his career will be closer to LeBron than Ben ever will"
LaMelo Ball
"I agree in part, I do think the league itself attempts to promote other stars, like Ive seen hundreds tweets from the nba about lamelo ball for even the simplest things. I think a major issue is also how the networks cover the league, all the anlysis on espn, tnt and fox sports does what you say by focusing on a few stars. After jazz choked againts the clippers in game 5 I expected in depth analysis on how they messed up but instead every show focused exclusively on PG and his preformance."
Lot of players with the extra 2 letters in their names lmao  DeMarcus Cousins  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De'Andre Hunter  DeAndre' Bembry  Devonte' Graham  De'Aaron Fox  LaMelo Ball  LaMarcus Aldridge  LeBron James  probably more I don't know
My real hot take is that Lamelo Ball will be the best player since Lebron and leads in the new era
Lonzo would be really good actually and if LaMelo had a better 3pt shot he would be the absolute perfect guard beside Mitchell (he allows Mitchell to play more off ball and can defend bigger guards).
Hornets and Pelicans will make it next year. LaMelo Ball and Zion gonna be in the race for mvp
Hopefully Lamelo Ball leads Charlotte one dayüôåüèæ
Woj:  &gt;Team Australia is in talks to replace Ben Simmons with Lamelo Ball in the upcoming Olympics.
"This is silly. Also if anyone's going to be the next Maravich, it's LaMelo Ball."
Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Ja Morant  Lamelo Ball  De'Aaron Fox
"Basketball, Lonzo Ball, Lamelo Ball, Liangelo Ball and Lavar Ball.  Who knew Sam Prestie's ultimate goal was to assemble the Ball gauntlet."

Celebrities React To LaMelo Ball Winning Rookie Of The Year https://youtu.be/r8ETNoGATFg
"Apparently reading comprehension isn't your strong suit. Meaning Ball was in an environment where they relied on him boosting his stats.  &gt;&gt;There's a reason 2 teams passed on Ball  &gt;Yeah, it's called ""they fucked up"".  Wow another Lamelo fan boy, such a surprise. Guarantee he's a all but forgotten in a few years as a role player, or worse goes the way of Carmelo"
"Oh ya sure  Edwards: monster dunk over Watanabe that should've sent him back to Japan  Media: crickets  LaMelo: wide open lay up that no one defended bc the fucking clock ran out and the hornets are down by 14 points.  Media: omfg play of the year, holy shit never have we seen a move like that, Jordan and LeBron should be worshipping at the alter of the Ball family dynasty right now.  It's been like that all year"

"Kelly Oubre on Curry:  You know, they say all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Steph Curry, and you can see that statement is not true! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another baller, you got a 50-50 chance of winnin'. But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal, so you got a 25% at best at beatin' me! And then you add LaMelo Ball to the mix? Your chances of winnin' drastically go down. See the three-way, for the MVP, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning. But I, I got a 66 2/3 chance of winning, cause LaMelo Ball KNOWS he can't beat me, and he's not even gonna try! So, Steph Curry, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25 percent chance, and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winnin the MVP! But then you take my 75 perchance chance at winnin', if we was to go one-on-one, and to add 66 2/3 percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning the MVP! See, McCurry; the numbers don't like, and they spell disaster for you for MVP!"
1. Dennis Schroder/ minutes for Payton Pritchard is an upgrade over Kemba Walker  2. Tyrese Haliburton is better than De‚Äôaron Fox (this might not be unpopular)  3. Ben Simmons/tyrese Maxey/ Jaden Springer/ Thybulle/ 1 2022 first for Lillard makes the Blazers better in 2023 than they would be just with Lillard in that season (coming from a die hard Blazer fan)   4. Jalen Suggs has the best career in the rookie class  5. Twolves are top 6 seed in 2022 playoffs  6. Knicks miss the 2022 playoffs  7. Wizards make the playoffs  8. Detroit Pistons make the playin tourney (10 seed)  9. Hornets get top 4 playoff seed in 2022  10. Lamelo Ball makes one of the all NBA teams in 2022.  Not sure I actually believe all of these but I‚Äôm pretty sure all are somewhat unpopular and I can at least see them maybe happening.   Would love to hear which are most realistic.   Edit: fixing a couple typos
"Yes I am aware of that, but so did countless other NBA players. I've never discredited their work ethic, but to see people rally and feel inspired by the Ball brothers is still baffling to me because let's be honest. Without Lavar and his antics (made possible by his wealth), Lonzo wouldn't have been picked that high and no one would've known who Gelo is. Lamelo is the exception here.   And to your point, the Paul brothers actually do train rigorously once they committed to boxing. But their fans are actual 10 year olds I don't see any grown adult cheering for them unironically."
Sorry I meant Carmelo Anthony not LaMelo Ball
"LaMelo Ball peaked when he won ROTY, he will never be an all NBA player."
im pretty sure every FO would rather have lamelo ball than simmons  melo is 19 and already quite good. i was very impressed by him
"Why is it that you think Ingram and Zion won‚Äôt work out due to Ingram defense? Could you not make the same argument about Jokic and MPJ? Kyrie and Harden? Lillard and Mccollum? Trae young, lamelo ball etc etc?"
"Alternatively  'The Philadelphia 76ers have traded Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey to the Charlotte Hornets for LaMelo Ball, James Bouknight, and their 2022/24/26 FRPs'   'Sources say Hornets owner Michael Jordan wants to make a playoff push now, and believes Ben Simmons could be the next heir of LeBron James'"
"Agree w/ the Bulls being overrated. Zach Lavine is miscast as a no1 option. They put themselves in position to make the playoffs and thats it.  Disagree with the G League point. NCAA has alot of cultural momentum, but I think a minor league system is a great way to get kids paid and in the NBA out of high school. Theres already been a couple of kids who went overseas bypassing college. Brandon Jennings, Lamelo Ball, Jalen Green. I think its great to give the kids options, and anything that can stick it to the NCAA is ok in my book."
Lamelo Ball isn‚Äôt all that he‚Äôs cracked up to be. He can make some really pretty passes and it makes for exciting basketball but I don‚Äôt ever see him being a starting point guard for one of the better teams in the league.
Lamelo Ball obviously
"maybe because people don't understand how words work, but how many fans if they sat down and thought about it would say he's better than at least 4 guys on this list:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  Brogdon  Sexton  Lamelo Ball  Lonzo Ball  Ja Morant  I think he is definitely worse than all of these guys, and he would need to be better than three of them to even be ""average""."
It‚Äôs pretty close tbf https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statspros.com/lamelo-ball-vs-malcolm-brogdon-stats/amp/ I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd count lamelo as better from those stats given that he didn‚Äôt even start for a lot of the season
Donovan Mitchell will never live up to the hype of being a superstar.  Lamelo Ball is going to bring a championship to Charlotte in a few years.

Flashy plays/highlights (John Wall and LaMelo Ball)
"Ridiculous post.  LaMelo obviously has the adoration of his teammates and seems to celebrate their success.  Lonzo also had no gripes about moving off the ball this season after being the point guard since he came into the league.  Gripe all you want about Lavar, but his kids seem to be good people and teammates."
"I think it can be taught if a young player doesn‚Äôt possess it initially. We‚Äôve seen players develop playmaking during their careers such as derozan, harden, randle, and others. The caveat is, for a person to develop this playmaking and decision making in a half court setting they have to have the ball in their hands. That‚Äôs why players like Lebron, Nash, CP3, and others have separated themselves so far in terms of bbiq and playmaking because from the onset of their careers they were trusted to make these playmaking reads. Having the mental chops to control the half court game as a 19-20 year old is super rare and is why prospects such as Luka, Lamelo, and Cade are and were so highly regarded. Prospects who can come into the league with the inherent ability to decision make at an elite level are far and few between, and this is the part of playmaking and bbiq that I feel is inherent. However, I still see it as possible to develop a playmaking game in the league however in incremental steps. We‚Äôve seen this in ball dominant players who‚Äôs playmaking has slowly but steadily risen (Giannis, Derozan) and you can see it slowly starting to improve in young stars today that didn‚Äôt come in with playmaking chops such as Zion, Tatum, Booker, and Lavine. These players will likely not reach the levels of Luka, Lebron, or Jokic who had that playmaking feel right from the onset, but they can definitely become 6, 7, 8 assist players a night towards the peak and post peak years. In short I feel as elite playmaking can be taught in the nba, with the caveat that progress will be slow, and the player will require the ball in their hands at a high rate. However these players will not rival the playmaking ability of players who inherently seem to understand how to control the half court offense. And the rarity of prospects having this ability while being able to score at an elite level is almost generational and could be argued to be inherent and unteachable"
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"So in a 40 minute game, in a defensive oriented league,  where NBA rookies like LaMelo Ball (who you will recall won ROTY) averaged 16 points a game you think IT whoops dropped from all NBA rosters would average 55? Just wanted to confirm before I call you a nephew."
"Easily Melo. The entire Ball family is already well known, adding to the fact that Lamelo is a popular player in the league."
"Marketable? It‚Äôs Lamelo by a long shot right now. What Green has going for him is an aesthetic game and his looks lol. In every interview I‚Äôve seen of him I haven‚Äôt seen a face of the league personality. He‚Äôs young tho so that can change  Better? I think I gotta go with Jalen right now. He has a better shot to be the best player on a championship team but that depends if Lamelo improves his scoring because players are going to want to play with him. Not crazy ball dominant, unselfish and exciting, seems like he‚Äôs having fun out there. Very similar to Steph in that way. Oubre has already touched on how things seem to changing there in Charlotte"
Lamelo has already proven to be an NBA playmaker and a pretty great player at that.  Jalen green is still an unknown.   Lamelo Ball is the answer
Lonzo and Lamelo Ball
"I usually pick the most ""even"" matchup or the most interesting one between the two teams rather than any individual player. Probably Lamelo Ball would be the worst player to make me overlook an otherwise interesting matchup"

"Rozier is bad any time he is asked to handle the ball and make plays for others. After the first month or so of 2019-20, he wasn't really asked to do that at all and has been an impactful player since. He's become a phenomenal shooter two consecutive years, it's not just a fluke anymore. Playing alongside Devonte' Graham and then LaMelo Ball and Hayward, he hasn't needed to handle much and has just focused on being open.   Losing Graham has me a bit worried about this though- if Ish Smith gets hurt or is just not that good, Rozier is going to have to play backup PG again which is where he becomes terribly inefficient."
"Both. He‚Äôs worse at ball handling, playmaking and defence, but likely the best/ most consistent shooter. I think a lot of their high school basketball was freestyle, so Lamelo and Lonzo got a great feel of the game as the were playing PG so LiAngelo didn‚Äôt quite get the same experience. Then playing at Ucla and when Lamelo went back to high school/Aus this gave the other two real experiences of structured basketball that LiAngelo hasn‚Äôt ever had.   The fact he‚Äôs shorter and less athletic means he‚Äôs undersized to defend his position but not mobile enough to guard 1‚Äôs and 2s, so he‚Äôs got to rely to hussle and effort to probably only ever be a satisfactory defender."
"LaMelo.  Lavar ""I Told You So"" Ball always speaks it into existence."
"Steph Curry, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, LaMelo Ball and Ja Morant are probably must watch too. Charlotte is going to be fun as fuck to watch this year. Gonna try to watch them and the Nuggets in addition to the Warriors.  Jordan Poole is lowkey an amazing watch too. He's got a nasty handle, flashy passes, acrobatic finishes, and some footwork to get off difficult shots. He's in that Nick Young/JR Smith category where they aren't all-star caliber, but give you all-star highlights."
LaMelo Ball and Crawford have similar flair when they play. They have this natural shake and confidence in their movement and the balls to take contested shots
Right now I enjoy watching LaMelo Ball. He plays with so much fun.   I love Jamal Crawford‚Äôs shake and bake.  I remember practicing it nonstop until I was able to pull it off in a pick-up.
Lonzo: 3+D Guard with great vision in the full court however lacks the ability to be a good finisher around the rim which hampers his ability in the half court.  LaMelo: Higher ceiling then Lonzo. Amazing court vision and aggression. Could be a high quality volume guy. Defense needs work but he has the physical tools to get there.  Gelo: He can shoot the ball. Needs to show other tools to actually get a team slot in the league.
I agree. No summer league will be as lit as it was during Lonzo‚Äôs rookie season. The arena was packed every time the Lakers played. LaMelo Ball is a walking highlight. And you saw yesterday people actually care to see Gelo play
"Lonzo is a damn good and be a player, he's obviously taken the time to improve his shooting, his free-throw shooting got exponentially better as well as well as the three pointers, he's a very good passer and a very good Defender     When LiAngelo is a good athlete but obviously just hasn't made it to the league yet, I don't think his dad should have pulled him out of UCLA , he just comes off as an needing as much help as he could get     I think lamelo has real star if not Superstar potential, he carries himself well and has a fun and exciting game to watch, I knew I liked him as soon as he stole the ball from embiid at the end of that game when the rest of his teammates were pretty much ready to pack it in so that tells me there's some strong intangibles as well to go with the good game     Shout out to Lavar"
"Wow I was going to say the exact same thing, the Ball brothers get this the most...  I think lonzo is a bit under 6'5"", Lamelo a weak 6'6, maybe even shorter. But the amount of people that discussed his (incredible) passing with ""that vision at 6'8"". He's listed 6'6"" everywhere since he got into nba. But people are still talking about his inflated shoe height lol that he had in NBL.  I'm guessing if they get 6'7.5 *in shoes*, these other leagues will list it at 6'8"". But bball shoes are thick af, so it turns into sometimes 3 inches different (Kevin Love for example)."
"The most blatant ones i've seen recently that might have actually even been lies from hyped up fans and not the players themselves are the Ball brothers.. I've seen people call Lonzo 6'7"" and remember before Lamelo was drafted people saying ""yooo he's grown to 6'8""-6'9"" when in reality both of them are around 6'4""-6'5"", MAYBE close to 6'6"" on a good day lol"
"In reality though I don't think it's so much about the ball family being popular, but more about lonzo being overhyped, then lamelo being ""under"" hyped, so now people are like ""i gotta see for myself"" lol"
"It's better if you want to impress Summer League reactionaries lol.   Jalen Johnson hadn't played a game since February and dropped 20/10 and was as impressive as Green/Kuminga, what's the spin for that?  As far as LaMelo, I think if Edwards played on a team as good as Charlotte/wasn't forced to be the #1 option with DLo and KAT out, he wouldve had a very comparable rookie year to LaMelo.   As far as Wiseman, he didn't even play college ball, so ofc he was gonna be behind."
Remember when last season when Lamelo breathing the air would get more views than a career game from Ant? It'll repeat again  If anything I feel bad for Lonzo. Dudes been like excommunicated by the Ball family fandom
"He was literally born and molded into a spot up shooter, and has played that way the entirety of his life. When he was a kid he would just wait for Lonzo or LaMelo to throw the ball at him."
"Hornets went from a garbage team nobody wants to watch outside Hornets fans and MJ stans to ""HOLY SHIT LAMELO BALL GONNA LOB IT TO KAI JONES/BRIDGES/BOUK"""
"I feel like with how much Lonzo's shooting has improved, there's a decent chance the Bulls would have been interested in both Ball brothers running the backcourt. Not to mention LaMelo might have wanted to convince the FO to try to get his brother."
Look I‚Äôm the biggest Timberwolves and Edwards fan but even I know we made a mistake and should‚Äôve traded the better player Lamelo Ball!!
"You keep on downvoting me, which is hilarious. Also, I could be wrong but he played all four seasons of high school ball. Lamelo was the one who was taken out early. Anyway, I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre fanboying over Gelo but to each his own."
Not sure what that has to do with drafting Wiseman over Lamelo Ball.
"LaMelo Ball.  HMs: Garland, Issac, Keldon, Rui, KPJ, JJJ"
Is it just me or do I like the Hornets less bc every time they have a highlight their color commentators just ruin it. Guy screams LAMELO every time he touches the ball it's unbearable
I though Lamelo was years away from being a player and wanted Wiseman as a project big. Dude just killed it and plays such a weird style of ball and it just works. So happy to be wrong.
"Got a lot of love and respect for the Aussie as well as the nbl. I‚Äôm a big fan of the ball bros and I really enjoyed the nbl while lamelo was there. On top of Australia basketball performing well lately in international stages, the nbl needs more respect developing great players into the nba as well it‚Äôs culture. I Gotta put it as at least the 3rd best league aside the euro league."
"2024 way too early Roster  PG - Morant, Lamelo Ball, Steph Curry/Trae Young  Wings - Ingram, B. Mitchell, Lavine, Tatum, Brown  Post - Williamson, Isiah Stewart, Michael Porter Jr/AD, John Collins  Note I'm only going with players who have played in a NBA game."
"I mean, I just flat out disagree. Liangelo Ball just got a g league spot with the hornets because of Lamelo. Lamelo has no where near the influence Lebron has. On top of that, Liangelo was the 226th best HS prospect vs Bronny being ranked 30th. There is literally no future where not a single team gives Bronny a roster spot. Regardless of if he deserves it."
"My top five  1. Gary Trent Jr   2. Kevin Porter Jr.  3. Lonzo Ball  4. Kelson Johnson  5. Kyle Kuzma  I feel like most of the people mentioned are   - Stars (Zion, Shai, Sabonis, Ja), and would need a 1st team All-NBA or an MVP to win  - Second Year (LaMelo, Edwards, Haliburton), and would all need to be legitimate stars to win it since there is a bias   - Guys that will probably be mostly as good if not a little better (FVV, Ben, Fox)"

Lamelo with the ball with multiple lob threats around him! Lob City is back and now resides in Charlotte!
Lamelo ball has as many fans if not more then Zion. Plus lonzo in Chicago now a huge market. Not to mention how good Chicago is. I think Chicago will have. Xmas game at the least
The anti-Lamelo. This man has never passed the ball a day in his life. Hornets fans gonna find out how much of a black hole he is real quick.
"Welp looks like our lineup is all but set for next season  PG: Ball, Smith  SG: Rozier, Bouknight  SF: Hayward, Oubre  PF: Washington, Bridges  C: Plumlee, ?????    ---  It's definitely a worse team than last season. The only way I see us finishing top 8 (or injuries go our 6) is that a combination of some (not neccessary all) of these things to happen   -  LaMelo takes an absurd leap in his scoring ability. Like as a guy that can get 20-23 a night I guess. I don't expect that in his sophomore year though that's a difficult ask so I won't be upset if he doesn't   - JB somehow turns this on-paper bottom 10 defense to a top half defense   - One of Miles/PJ takes a leap to a borderline all-star level talent   - Hayward doesn't miss 40% of the season    ----   Ultimately I think we are on a crash course to a solid 10 seed. I don't like giving Oubre a multi-year deal.   What are the ramifications of this deal on us giving Miles and PJ extensions next offseason?"
"Yeah Miles took the Leap that last stretch of the season. Dude was absolutely electric. You guys have a great young core cooking, and if the ball bounces the right way I think Lamelo makes the all star team next year."
"&gt;If Schroeder had a more solid and consistent 3 ball  He'd make at least $25M a season, probably more.  Check the list of veteran players who averaged more assists than Schroder last year.  The only two who made less than Schroder were TJ McConnell and Ricky Rubio. Rubio is one of the worst shooters in the league, and doesn't defend. McConnell is a 7ppg player.    The rest of that 6+ assist club? Westbrook, Young, Paul, Doncic, Draymond Green, Jokic, Lillard, Morant, Fox, Butler, DeRozen, Simmons, Sabonis, VanVleet, LaMelo Ball, Garland, Jrue Holiday, Conley, Irving, Randle, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brogdon, and Stephen Curry.  Not many cheap players on that list.  Playmaking is one of the rarest and most-valuable skills in basketball."
**G:** DeJounte Murray   **G:** Trae Young   **F:** LaMelo Ball  **F:** Zach LaVine   **C:** Malcolm Brogdon   **Bench:** TJ McConnell / Jalen Brunson / DAngelo Russell / Jamal Murray / Cam Payne
LaMelo Ball  Shai Gilgeous Alexander  Mikal Bridges  Jaren Jackson Jr  DeAndre Ayton
"Lamelo Ball SGH OG Anunoby Tobias Harris Deandre Ayton  2nd round exit maybe. Could use Jamal Murray instead of Lamelo, or Jeremi Grant/MPJ instead of Tobias, but I think the spacing and switch ability is at its best with those five.   OG is an absolute must include though, you aren‚Äôt getting defence that versatile with serviceable offence from any other non-all star player in the league that I can think of"
Lamelo Ball - Duncan Robinson - OG Anunoby - Xavier Tillman - Jarret Allen
* LaMelo Ball * CJ McCollum * MPJ * Sabonis * Ayton
"Or another schedule adjustment I would do as an alternative   - 12:00 pm- Hornets vs Bulls- Lonzo vs LaMelo on Christmas...nothin like a good old fashioned sibling rivalry game on Christmas...The Ball family will be in attendance for this game guaranteed. LaVar and Tina will be there to watch their sons go at it. LaMelo gets to play on Xmas for the first time ever and who better for him to go up against on Xmas than his older brother, Lonzo?  - 2:30 pm- Hawks vs Knicks- Rematch of the 1st Round of the Playoffs...almost a true rivalry game because of the fact that Trae became a villain in The Garden and Knicks get their chance at payback...this game happens at the Garden  - 5:00 pm- Suns vs Bucks- Rematch of the 2021 NBA Finals...it is only fitting and the game happens in Milwaukee   - 8:00 pm- Nets vs Lakers- KD vs LeBron on Christmas...Westbrook also gets to go up against KD on Christmas with his new team the Lakers. Plus this is a Finals preview more or less the NBA Finals matchup we should have got this past season but we were robbed of. Plus it gets to go down at Staples Center.  - 10:30 pm (late nighter)- Mavericks vs Warriors- Luka vs Steph on Christmas because it isn't Christmas without either of these guys being there on the marquee"
"Honestly if we can choose our own team, I actually greatly enjoyed Lamelo Ball in Charlotte. Kid plays 100% and watching him and Maxey sprint all around the court together was a joy to watch."
"34 years old Damian Lillard.   Lamelo LaFrance Ball, assuming Hornets don't find the success they envisioned.  Or any PG from Klutch (Ben Simmons, Trae Young, Darius Garland)  I'm just thinking of PGs for AD, hoping he stays."
High on Valanciunas and Zach Lavine. Their efficiencies are hard to ignore and I believe JV is a main reason Memphis has been above board the past couple of seasons  Low on Lamelo Ball. I still think he is a brilliant player but he is not all star ready as people in here think.
Why isn‚Äôt lamelo ball playing for Aus?
"Lamelo ball, lonzo ball, doesnt matter to me just give me someone who will put in more effort than this sorry squad"
Shoulda picked Lamelo Ball - at least he can beat NBL players
I just realized it's entirely within the realm of possibility for LaMelo Ball to be the starting point guard for Team USA one day
"LaMelo Ball, Liangelo Ball, Lonzo Ball."
"Im not a big lavar fan, i think the way he publically speaks on his sons careers isnt great, but you cant deny he instilled some good work ethic and attitude in the ball brothers. Lonzo was hyped, wasnt living up to they hype, so he worked hard to GitGud. Lamelo was doubted coming into the draft, but he exceeded expectations and looks like he will be able to really impact games. Curious to see what comes of liangelo"
"Not sure if this exactly qualifies, but when people say that the reason LiAngelo Ball went undrafted and is currently not in the NBA, is because of the China Shoplifting incident. People fail to realize that he was always projected to go undrafted even before the incident and he was only taken at UCLA because of Lonzo and Lamelo. Basically Lavar saying, ""if you want Lonzo and Lamelo, y'all need to take LiAngelo too""."
"I have Knicks and Hornets much higher.   Think Knicks are legit, and that LaMelo Ball is a real one and will become like Luka"
"The weird thing about Graham is that he doesn't ""look"" that good. He's not been shooting well, has a reputation of an awful defender, some fans say he also cannot run the offense, and generally everybody thinks that Pelicans absolutely demolished themselves getting him for Lonzo. It was sure they're gonna push him just for picks (which I was writing more as a joke, I probably joked about a greater return than what they actually got now).  BUT... The Hornets were always a miles better team with him than without him! By so far and so universally that it seems suspicious. It's not a fluke, they did generally very bad without him. Every player - Rozier, Hayward, LaMelo - Hornets had a positive score when they played with Graham, and negative without him. Especially when they played LaMelo without Graham, they were getting completely destroyed. Especially the defensive rating of the team was much better.  So... does he actually have a good side that fans don't see? Is he actually a good playmaker for others? Is his off-ball defense sneakily on point and filling the gaps, more than making it up for what fans see as bad individual defense? Does his ability to avoid turnovers, and to generate opponent turnovers, have an underrated influence on the score?  I think some of it is true. But I'm not betting yet on Pellies succeeding with him."
I think Lamelo Ball is the next great American talent. His feel for the game is amazing and I think he will only get better once his scoring and shooting improve.
"LaMelo is easily the highest profile NBL draftee, that should have been enough to convince some prospects that it's a good league to show off your draft stock. He shot the ball like a blind man but it was obvious watching him play (which scouts do, unlike most of us) that he was already a mature playmaker with a fantastic feel for the game"
"In some ways, I think the NBL is a better league for preparation for NBA play than Europe.   Yes, the NBL doesn't have the talent of the top European leagues, but the style of play is closer to NBA, and it's probably the most physical top-tier league in the world.  You can see how players who played in the NBL and didn't star have done OK in the NBA (LaMelo Ball, Childress, Hampton)."
"No he didn‚Äôt fit. They wanted a catch and shoot backup two and he improved at everything but that - proving deadly with the ball in his hands, not as good as they wanted off the screen, but still very effective. Then injured. Then Devonte Graham. Fight back into lineup. Then Drug suspension. Then LaMelo ball. Covid. No minutes. Played a 6‚Äô5‚Äù turnover-prone guy over him because they wanted size?   He wasn‚Äôt appreciated, no role for him, he‚Äôs out :("
"It would be LeBron, Dean Wade (D-Wade), Cameron Payne (CP), and LaMelo Ball (Melo)."
Dude what? Casuals think ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù is LaMelo ball.
"I disagree  Plumlee one is actually the deal I am fine with and actually quite like. Cody Zeller, while better on both ends, was gonna leave, he made it clear. We needed a stopgap early doors and Mitch got one while also moving up twenty spots in the draft to select imo the best value pick of the four selections with JT Thor at 37  While Plumlee is very poor on defense, he at least brings similar stuff to Cody on offense with his athleticism and drive and kick ability. His contract is fine too    -----   Not extending your 23 lottery pick guard after he has shown improvement on both sides of the ball year after year is just so shortsighted   Devonte' too, like whatever, we got a lotto protected first. But now we're stuck with what Brad Wanamaker? Grant Riller? as the backup. George Hill is worse than both those players  The fact is all the reasonable free agents we can get are worse than Monk/Te' in my opinion    ----   All of his decisions I would deem more acceptable if it's clear we were going on a rebuilding route, but then the question becomes if you're rebuilding why sign Hayward, who has hay and chalk making up his knees, to 30m AAV while also waiving and stretching Batum (the most ridiculous thus far).    We are reeking towards mediocrity (like at best a 6 seed) for the next couple years or so unless LaMelo becomes idk someone like a Trae Young level player of impact on the offensive end. And while he is a very very promising point guard, I'm skeptical that we have anyone on our roster who can go get you 25+ PPG and be a superstar like that"
"Lonzo is on his first of two or three big contracts. Lamelo looks like he's going to be a max player. Liangelo is on the Pistons G-League team.   Lavar Ball, while taking care of his disabled wife, got three sons to the NBA, and two of those sons are likely going to earn well over 9 figures before they're 30. The one who won't is already a millionaire. That's after he got them all to UCLA.   I don't care how you feel about Lavar, his antics, or him being loquasious. That's one hell of an accomplishment. He's still close with all of his kids and they're all seemingly good people (and yes that includes Liangelo. Stealing sunglasses when you're 19 doesn't make you a bad person forever)"
LaMelo Ball
"That draft wasn't that good for fit. If they pick LaMelo he'd look a lot worse with us not giving him any opportunities outside of the 2nd unit. In no universe does LaMelo and Draymond play together well with Warriors system completely dependent on Draymond having the ball to mask his shooting weakness.   Klay's injury also made it more clear contending that season was going to be difficult. There was no reason to even try to draft for pick, which is 99% of the time a bad idea anyways. They thought Wiseman had the most potential - and he still does - which makes the draft make sense. We didn't exactly utilize him well last season with Draymond force feeding him against 2 defenders."
"Yeah, but I can't really recall a time when there were a lot of high-profile, young guards that were 6'5-6""+, with there being Luka, LaMelo and Cade being the big three, and if that'll shape how teams scout players and how players are taught the game, like how bigs suddenly need to stretch the floor to the 3 to be effective, or wings need to be strong inside to play small ball 4/5 lineups."
"Bouk seems to be a 2, while Graham is a true PG and playmaker. Bouk is more of a Monk replacement. This move means we literally only have LaMelo as our only ball handler, unless Brad Wanamaker returns or we promote Grant Riller.  Also, before anyone mentions him, Rozier is NOT a PG. Please do not pretend that he is, as you will trigger your local Hornets fan."
Lamelo ball and a great draft we are fine
"This is Lonzo Ball. Not LaMelo. Sorry, to dampen your excitement"
"Lauri would probably be pretty good with literally anyone that can pass like Lamelo. Lauri played his best ball with Kris Dunn, who actually involve him in the offense. Lauri definitely needs to take responsibility for some of the things he lacks, but never having a decent playmaker to play alongside has definitely hurt his development."
&gt;. How does this help Charlotte?  Be there when Lamelo pass the ball?
"Graham can run the half-court offense New Orleans NEEDED. Ball can be the true point Chicago NEEDED. Lauri is the question mark. Does he really make sense for Charlotte? I'm a Bulls fan, which is probably why I don't see it. Maybe a Lamelo-run offense is good for    Lauri. Regardless, I'd love it if this deal happened"
"Also LaMelo and Lonzo Ball had it pretty tough. They had to grow up with LaVar as their father.  (/s, LaVar actually seems like a pretty good dad)"
LaMelo Ball
It would be great if yall bring back Monk assuming this trade happens. Monk and Bouknight I think is a good two guard bench combo. Ideally you'd stagger Terry and Lamelo more since they are the two better ball handlers. Maybe even have Haywayrd run more of the plays when Lamelo is off the court.
LaMelo Ball probably and only after one year
Hornets should be lamelo/terry/gordon/miles/pj  with mason plumlee starting on certain nights. Miles and pj are too good to come off the bench and pj as a small ball center worked well for us last yr.
"Part of my frustration with these lists is wtf even is a PG anymore.  Is Harden a PG?  He brings the ball up and usually initiates the offense, however he's usually not guarding the primary ball handler.  Same with LeBron, same with Luka.  Talent/potential-wise I don't think this list is far off, but if I were assembling a team I'd probably rather have CP3 than Kyrie or Trae.  I like LaMelo and he could eventually be towards the top of this list, but for THIS season I'd rather have Conley and probably FVV or Lowry."
Lamelo Ball
Anthony Edwards will make an All-Star team before LaMelo Ball
"Next Hornets legend. Forget LaMelo Ball, we building around the god of thunder"
"crazy that getting injured affected Mutombo's chances, but Lamelo ball getting injured and also having worse stats than Anthony Edwards didn't stop him from winning ROTY"

"I think he maybe lost a half-step defensively. He's not as steady as he used to be against fast ball-handlers and these new-age giant guards like LaMelo. Still a plus defender, but I think you'll see his impact begin to trend downwards from this season on.   Offensively he still has the juice if he's rested and healthy, but don't look for him to be a top scorer anymore. On a team like Miami however he fits like a glove, and can focus on doing all the little things he's so good at.   I don't think he'll be an All-Star but if he has a good year I'd hope for him to make it as a reserve"

Lamelo Ball?
Kawhi Leonard - He's a Kawaii  Hassan Whiteside - He's a White Side  Derick Favors - He is a Favor  Lonzo Ball/Lamelo/Liangelo - They are balls  Buddy Hield - He's a Healer  Kendrick Nunn - He's a Nun  Malik Monk - He's a Monk  Harold Miner - He's a Miner  Dragan Bender - He can Bend a Dragon  Devonte Graham - He's a Graham  Dion Waiters - He's a Waiter

Lonzo Ball 10. D'Angelo Russell  I think its pretty cool that D'Angelo Russell is like the 20th best point guard in the league. We're really stacked at that position and should be for a long time since we seemingly get 1-2 franchise point guards in the draft each year.

"Nahh. It was pretty obvious Lamelo had a high ceiling. Especially when he had the growth spurt and still looked agile and coordinated. If you watched all three ball brothers when they played in Chino Hill, it was clear he was the most naturally gifted. He was 14 playing with guys older, bigger and stronger and was still able to do his thing based on his skill, IQ and confidence."
Lamelo ‚Äú~~Magic~~ Hornets Curry‚Äù Ball ftfy
Damn Lamelo improved so much. Same with Lonzo. No one can shit on ball brothers anymore lol
Lamelo Ball is the first NBA player in history to record the name Lamelo Ball as a player
Not hot enough. Was Michael Jordan the first LaMelo Ball?
"On Lamelo Ball: Why are people so optimistic on a player who can't shoot, finish or defend ?"
LAMELO BALL
"Accept your new overlord, Lamelo ‚ÄúMagic Curry‚Äù Ball"
Look what LaMelo Ball has done to this man
Everybody in my fantasy league mocked me when I named my squad LaMelo Ball 2022 MVP and drafted him in the first round üòà
Still lost to the future mvp LAMELO BALL
Lmao as a fan of teams completely unrelated I always hated the Ball family.  Annoying as hell.  But LaMelo so good I'm over it.
   Lamelo Ball and Ja Morant
"How was kuminga horrible ? Did you watch him play at all? He couldn‚Äôt do anything on both ends of the floor outside of his first 3 games. Limited role won‚Äôt suit  him that well since his best attribute is ball handling and he‚Äôs not a smart cutter and has a broken jumpe, along with and touch around the rim. Lamelo and  Edwards are the exception not the rule. I‚Äôm not acting like Lakers piece are anything special but come on now kuminga and wiseman being major contributors this season is a pipe dream."
LeBron was playing in the NBA when LaMelo Ball was 2 years old.
T-3 years until he becomes known as LaMelo ‚ÄúYoung Socialite‚Äù Ball
"he probably wants a current player, not one of your old favs. get him a luka jersey, or tre yung, or lamelo ball. that's what the yungsters like"
"the dude had fucking nerve damage and couldn‚Äôt lift his right arm above his shoulder for over a year. being a slightly below average nba starter is incredibly impressive after that, and he was that his first year in orlando. last year he showed signs of rebuilding his shot (he shot 73% his first year in orlando from the line, that‚Äôs better than ja morant and about equal to lamelo ball and rj barrett who definitely aren‚Äôt viewed as ‚Äúcant shoot for shit‚Äù. can‚Äôt shoot 3s but he‚Äôs got a nice midrange game, incredible handles, good strength, great vision. it‚Äôs clear you haven‚Äôt watched him play once in orlando"
Imagine thinking fucking lamelo ball is currently capable of carrying a team to the playoffs‚Ä¶    This isn‚Äôt ‚Äú20 guys on rookie contracts who are better prospects‚Äù. It‚Äôs 20 guys who are the best players in the league right now and will win you the most games. Half the fucking list he gave can‚Äôt even make the playoffs as the best guy on the team and the other half are 3rd option specialist like jrue holiday. None of those guys are actually better than Westbrook right now.
"To add onto the other answers, it seems like the NBA is trending taller and taller at the guard positions. I wonder if this is a result of players just getting more and more athletic and/or AAU teams just giving the ball to their best player regardless of height (so that more tall players are developing guard skills). Feels almost like 6'4""/6'5"" is becoming the new 6'2""/6'3"" for guards. Of course there will always be exceptions but a lot of newer guards especially seem much taller. Luka, SGA, LaMelo are some recent examples that I think reflect this trend. And then in the recent draft, you have guys like Cade, Giddey, and Barnes."
LaMelo ball to take his team to the ECF.
"Miles can‚Äôt create shots though. He‚Äôs close to a knock down shooter, an insane lob threat and a good transition player. But he‚Äôs very dependent on playmakers from what I‚Äôve seen. That‚Äôs their main problem is that I only trust 3 players on the roster with the ball in their hands. Terry is score first, Hayward never plays, Melo is young and still can‚Äôt really control the game well. Watching their preseason games without Terry and Hayward literally everyone looked lost, even Melo. They don‚Äôt have anyone on the team who‚Äôs guaranteed to average 20 points this year. With all that, they need really good injury luck and they need Miles, Lamelo or PJ? I guess, to make a big leap to be a play-in lock imo.   I hope I‚Äôm wrong though, I‚Äôm a huge Melo stan and was mad as shit they lost to Washington. I‚Äôm hoping Melo takes off averages 22 and 7 and gets them to 6 or 7 seed."
"Ja should make Zach Lowe look more like a genius, **instead of an idiot**, by being more like LaMelo Ball/play more like he's hindered by Earth's gravitational pull."
"Yes. Too bad he can't do the things LaMelo Ball does, eh?"
NBL stats (scroll to totals): https://www.basketball-reference.com/international/players/lamelo-ball-1.html  Rookie year stats (scroll to totals): https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/ballla01.html  2 point fg% list: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_per_game.html  Shooting splits before injury: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/ballla01/gamelog/2021#1-41-sum:pgl_basic  Can‚Äôt seem to segment out 2pt% before the injury so can‚Äôt show the stats on that.   Be easy friend
"Not really.  People think he can‚Äôt shoot because of his NBL stats but we should really disregard that now that we have a solid NBA sample size.  LaMelo made more threes his rookie season (92) than he took his entire season in the NBL (80). He shot 48% on 2s last season, putting him in the company of Trey Young, Kamba Walker, and Ja Morant. He shot better from 2 than Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Edwards, Russell Westbrook, Dennis Schroeder, Julius Randle, and D‚ÄôAngelo Russell.  I‚Äôm too lazy to look up his stats before the injury, but if memory serves me correct he was shooting something like a 50/38/80 split. Post injury all his numbers really got dragged down and he couldn‚Äôt hit a three to save his life. Besides him constantly grabbing it every stoppage in play, it was obvious he needed more rehab time on that wrist to get his shooting form back.  But just from watching him, kid has a shooters touch. People hold his janky form against him but the ball goes in and his touch on 20 foot floaters is insane. Not to mention once he slowed down on his free throw routine he started shooting 85%.  Guy is a shooter, I think this next year really shows it."
"&gt;Lonzo‚Äôs full court office won‚Äôt transition to the nba/playoffs. Half court matters.  we don't know yet. People were saying the splash brothers couldn't go anywhere in the playoffs. Anyway, Lonzo doesn't always have to be the on ball playmaker, because they got Lavine and DeRozan for this. Lonzo can shoot and will space the floor while playing good D. He ain't Lamelo, but he knows his role and we'll see what he does come playoffs time."
Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Luka Doncic  Deadass those are the only players I could see an argument for being better than Lowry. And I don't even agree on some of them. If you think LaMelo Ball or Mike Conley is better than Lowry boy IDK what's wrong with you.
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"I‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll get accused of coping here, and that‚Äôs okay. I probably am. but people who would be considered starter quality on our team (miles bridges, lamelo ball, mason plumlee, pj washington, and i‚Äôm counting bouknight only because hayward, rozier, and kelly oubre were all out) accounted for a total of 82/240 possible minutes on the court. Our leading player in minutes in this game, jalen mcdaniels, is probably our 7th or 8th option on the team right now if not lower. we should have done better for sure, one of the worst games in NBA history is never excusable, but it‚Äôs not like this was the hornets best lineup getting destroyed. I‚Äôm sad bc it seems like nobody is taking that into account and just jumping straight to thinking we‚Äôre gonna be the worst team in the league in a year where a lot of hornets fans, myself included, have been excited to see what the team can do. I know it‚Äôs not that serious, but it has definitely been deflating for me personally."
its a 3 year contract where thye aren't going to be a contender anyways but this gives leverage to keep two really talented stars and lamelo could easily bolt charlotte.  They are easy to build around and both take pride in defense and ball movement so i can definitely see them as big pieces to a contender
"he should be.  ALl the crap he got, the guy was a man with a plan and a vision and the nba even if you're athletic adn gifted is very, very hard to be in to. 2/3 kids were top 3 picks, thats insane and something holidays, plumlees, lopez, or giannis bros can't say much.  The guy pushed them and it worked out pretty beautifully. Save for the dumb china incident, even if liangelo didn't make it he would've had a full ride to ucla.  All the crap talked abotu him, but his boys seem to never fight, talk trash, and more so they play ultimate team ball, move the ball up the transition constantly, passes or hockey passes just keep the ball rolling.  Their style of play doesnt reflect the narcissm which ball preaches.    Charlotte simply missed out of the goldmine of overpaying lonzo to come there, like they did with hayward, but it would be instant games more on national tv, a great story line, further more two athletic tall guards who can shoot and push the ball that may draw in other scorers finishers too.      I would've given Lonzo a 3 year close to max. That way when lamelo is up for extension they have leverage and can pay both and these guys generate more revenue, sales and attention than other at their level of play as they already have celebrity and for charlotte thats huge.  You can also win with those two as your 1/2"
Do you really think Zeller is significantly better than Plumlee? Personally I see Plumlee as a decent upgrade. Solid big who's a great passer. Doesn't need the ball and will benefit a ton from LaMelo.
i don‚Äôt like the lamelo take his difference on the floor last year was immense and he was easily the best playmaker one one of the biggest reasons for terry having the best season of his career since he could play more off ball   And with Cade he‚Äôs still clearly 6‚Äô6 which is the same height as lamelo and slow compared to nba players so i don‚Äôt see him playing at an mvp level ever but we‚Äôll just have to wait to see a full season and i may change my opinion but the lamelo take is horrible and he is able to take over games at times in only his rookie year and being extremely thin but i do understand that you may be low on his scoring upside but i can see hike averaging close to a 20-25 point triple double or something similar in like the 23/8.5/9 area
"These are the players I can't remember hearing a bad thing about all summer long. When a person says any of these names come up on a podcast, the other person immediately falls all over themselves to agree so emphatically that they might also take some credit for bringing him up. Saying you expect big things from these players is like saying the password to enter the sports media hootch parlor.   ...and if you have a 100% approval rating from group-thinky NBA podcasters, I'm sorry but you are probably overrated.  1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  2. Deandre Hunter  3. LaMelo Ball  4. Bruce Brown, Jr  5. Isaiah Stewart  6. RJ Barrett  7. Matisse Thybulle  8. Aaron Holliday  9. Luke Kennard"
"But isn‚Äôt Shaq mainly known for being super aggressive in the paint?  It‚Äôs like saying LaMelo Ball closely resembles Gary Payton, minus being an elite defender."
"One of the funnest in the league already - Gerti f Lamelo will do that for you! I personally barely watched any Hornets games before last season lol, but now y‚Äôall have such an exciting young squad with Ball, Bridges, PJ, Kai, Bouknight (both perfect fits with Ball) and perfect veterans around them. I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall make the playoffs"
Does it have a monopoly?   Last I heard these guys can go to Europe or do the g league ignite thing.  Didn't lamelo ball play abroad?
LaMelo's got a higher ceiling but I don't know if he's a better player right now. I like the fit of Sexton too next to Brogdon who can be the main ball-handler.  People are sleeping on the fact that Sexton averaged 24/4 last season on great efficiency. He just needs to be paired with a bigger playmaker. Charlotte's already doing that with LaMelo and Terry Rozier lol.
Aren't they really high on Miles Bridges? And they'd want Lamelo to have the ball in his hands.   Or would you think they'd move Gordon Hayward for Ben? Hayward actually fits really well next to Harris/Embiid imo
Malachi Flynn vs. Lamelo Ball
Lamelo Ball is who Ben Simmons thinks he is
"Right:   Ball Bros. When people were talking about LaMelo not even being picked in the draft, I was saying he could be a top 5 pick and would be an asset to any team.  Lonzo I wasn't necessarily exact about but I knew he would be a productive player. I thought his college shot would transfer and he'd be fine even with the unconventional jumper. Well it took a rework but he's become an elite shooter, mixed with everything else he does, he's only going to get better.  Wrong:  I thought Zion would be the next Greg Oden, shit I may still be right. Dominant when he's on the court but plagued by injuries and retired far earlier than he should. But so far it only seems like minor setbacks rather than career altering or ending injuries  Jarrett Culver: I thought his size and switchability would make him a valuable asset right from the start and the offense would come in time. Well he's almost out of the league so..."
"&gt;I don't know how many Warriors games you watched, but they were piss poor at center when facing bigger teams.   I know. But the point of a #2 pick is to draft a generational talent or someone ready to produce now. I'm not pissed at Wiseman being shit, I'm pissed at the decisionmakers double-guessing themselves when they already had the right choice. Just basing it on the fact that dude only played 3 games in college, they pretty much decided he's the safer pick because LaMelo Ball might end up like his brother who sucked at the start and wasn't worthy of the 2nd pick.  We don't know how long this team can keep playing at this level, we don't even know how good Klay will be when he gets back. I'm pissed at the fact that they knew who to pick yet they eventually had second thoughts and then picked the wrong guy.   You always pick BPA. Especially if you're already a contender. If we still were like the Jamison days sure go ahead and pick James, he's perfect for that.  I'm not trying to change your mind, and you damn sure won't change mine. I don't want Steph's last years to be wasted on a project that never pans out. It's frustrating to see how well Ball is playing, exceeding his initial draft projections and how good of a fit he would have been in this system"
"We need a second ball handler badly, and imagine 6'7 lamelo fishing to Steph and klay into their mid/late 30's."

"&gt;Saying Ball got here because ""his daddy sending him around the world to gain experience for the league"" is disingenuous because Wiseman could have done the same thing.  Dude, I don't know if you know, but Wiseman's family was in poverty before he got a NBA contract. Lavar lives in a mansion in Chino Hills. LaMelo was driving Lamborghinis before he graduated high school. Not only that, Lavar was raking in millions from his business, special appearances, and Facebook exclusive show. When you are struggling to make ends meet, you can't just get up and move to an entirely new country at will.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;talk about moving the goalposts. He was expected to be the starting center for a team that has championship aspirations.     Two things can be at the same time. I don't know how many Warriors games you watched, but they were piss poor at center when facing bigger teams. Their front-court was always their biggest issue. When facing players like Embiid, Atyon, Gobert, Valanƒçi≈´nas, and Jokic, the Warriors simply had no answer for them. That required Curry and Co. to work much harder to score because Draymond and whatever center they had couldn't make a shot past 6 feet. All long as Curry, Thompson, and Green share the floor together, the Warriors will always have championship aspirations. Wiseman needed time to get acclimated to the physicality of the NBA. Like I said before, dude was a high schooler playing against grown men who are more aggressive and physical than him.   Look, we can go back and forth on this, but I am not changing my mind. I support my favorite team and their players through thick and thin. I am more invested in being entertained than stressing out about who is better than who. Hell, Patrick Williams and Tyrese Maxey shocked everyone with how good they were, but I don't see Warriors fans dwelling on passing them up. Wiseman is a good kid and I want him to be successful. I didn't grow up much different than him, so I am rooting for him. If we still have a Reddit account a few years from now, we can get back in touch to see if the Wiseman experience pans out. Hopefully, you won't jump ship in the meantime."
"Idk their situation was unique at the the time. Why draft a guy that plays the same position as Curry? Sure, Curry might be better off ball than he is on ball, but then you have to account for and anticipate Klays return, who is the perfect backcourt partner for Curry. Lamelo would have been wasted and held back in Golden State"
"We're comparing them as they were drafted, not any other period. Saying Ball got here because ""his daddy sending him around the world to gain experience for the league"" is disingenuous because Wiseman could have done the same thing. Shit, LaMelo even tried playing in college but the NCAA cockblocked him. Besides, anyone watching basketball knew LaMelo was way better than his brother who was a high lotto pick as well...while Wiseman only had 3 games under his belt  Right now it's painfully obvious that the Warriors chose wrong. LaMelo Ball is the present and the future of the PG position in Charlotte, while James Wiseman has shown he can be a decent contributor, he's yet to get there, and even if he did, it isn't worth the 2nd pick that was used on him. Again, this team is contending for a championship so he'll be useless if he won't be a contributor. This pick was supposed to be the highlight of the DLo deal, or are we already forgetting that?  &gt;Wiseman was expected to be a 2-3 year project with the most upside out of anyone in the draft  talk about moving the goalposts. He was expected to be the starting center for a team that has championship aspirations. And he was for a while...until he showed that he's not ready. Instead he showed that he was slow, lacking in BBIQ, and not even close to being a threat with his jumper."
"LaMelo would've added at least another year to Steph's career by allowing Steph to play off-ball more often.  Klay and Steph off-ball, with LaMelo running the point and distributing in a couple of years."
Do you bench Klay or Steph to start Lamelo? What do you do with Draymond when you take the ball out of his hands ?
Did you see the Warriors change the offense to run PnR for Wiseman? They tried to mold him into the scheme they already had and are currently trying to make him into an Ayton who can shoot. Kerr won‚Äôt mold his scheme for a rookie. One of his flaws is he can be stuck in his ways. Because Dray isn‚Äôt much on offense without the ball in his hands he will still be the PG at the top of the arc with shooters getting open. Lamelo would be a secondary ball-handler like Steph so he needs to make good decisions but also knock down open shots. He is not going to be the primary ball handler until the 2nd quarter. Now I‚Äôm transition? Lamelo is probably handling the ball but primarily the ball decision making will be in Dray‚Äôs hands
"Dray will not be handling the ball more than LaMelo when both are on the same team, you don't play basketball on statsheets my dude. LaMelo has a far superior handle and you seem to be incapable of grasping the concept that the Warriors would change their offense significantly to bring the best out of Ball if they were to ever draft him."
I‚Äôm not talking about offense. And even then Dray and even Curry will still handle the ball more than Lamelo and he‚Äôd be a secondary ball handler until the second unit came in. I believe he‚Äôd be a good secondary ball-handler though. But on draft night Idk how much you want a guy who shot sub 30 from 3 play off-ball when you have Dray but whatever he clearly proved those shooting issues wrong.    On the Defense interior you are going to play terribly when Dray is the only guy who can defend inside. On the perimeter you‚Äôll be decent with smart defenders but you will be out rebounded by a ton of bigs if that‚Äôs your main lineup. Not to mention Dray shouldn‚Äôt be forced to put that much strain on his body being a full-time Center. I doubt he‚Äôd be healthy come playoff time so there goes our defense for good. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to start Looney but you do need your Center to be taller than 6‚Äô6 and your PF to be able to bang with bigs.
"To start? That‚Äôs going to be horrendous defensively and size wise since Klay probably won‚Äôt be the same defensively. So yes you do have to start a Center, whether it be Looney or a FA addition. That may be a closing lineup though in certain matchups. Primarily though Lamelo would be playing when Steph or Klay are on the bench as a PG with Steph/Klay as the SG. It‚Äôd be nice last year to have a ball-handler when Steph was off the court but that doesn‚Äôt solve our bench scoring issue we had."
"A talent like LaMelo would put everyone except All-Stars out of the starting lineup. Who're you gonna play in his place, Kevon Looney? A lineup of Steph Klay LaMelo Wiggins and Dray is mighty good on both sides of the ball."
Would you rather have an awesome 6th man or a good 6th man and a great big? If we needed a guard I‚Äôm going Lamelo Ball all the way but we did not need a guard. We needed a wing or a big. I don‚Äôt want to use the highest pick I hope to have in the decade to be a bench player for 3 of the next 4 years.
"[According to Jalen Rose, yes.](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/03/10/jalen-rose-warriors-told-lamelo-ball-on-draft-night-they-were-taking-him/)  &gt;‚ÄúRight after they got off the phone with LaMelo Ball‚Äôs team and telling them they were going to take him, I was a part of the next call,‚Äù said Rose. ‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, I sent an internal text to our producer on (NBA) Countdown and told them that. And then 3, 2,1, the pick happens and they didn‚Äôt do it. True story.‚Äù  This is some bush-league shit if true, and reinforces the fact that it's most likely an owner veto. Lacob probably thought Wiseman would be producing immediately."
you know Kerr's crazy ass would have put LaMelo in there with Steph and Klay. The ball movement and player movement would be crazy as hell.  And yes Poole broke out. But what if he didn't? We'd be left with a shitty sophomore center and even less firepower
"""Lamelo Ball With The Sweet, Sweet Dime. Oh My."" is gonna be said a lot this season, I can tell."
"I mean the basic rule is take the best player available. So many teams have been burned by not following that rule.  I think his IQ means he's gonna fit in Kerr's system much better right than Wiseman. If they both develop to their ceilings Ball is still the better overall player.  Whoever thought that passing on Ball was a good idea should get slapped.  a developed Ball, Curry, Klay, Dray will hide the deficiency at C or attract a quality C. Who wouldn't want to play with players who share the ball more efficiently than most teams?  I'm still fucking fuming they passed on LaMelo. Hope it doesn't bite us in the ass like Sacramento did for passing on Luka."
"Ok, TJ McConnell.... his rookie year he had more assists and less turnovers per 100 possessions than LaMelo.   If you discount per 100 possessions, and prefer just totals per game balancing assists and turnovers:   Damian Lillard  Elfrid Payton  Ricky Rubio  Ben Simmons Trey Young  Lonzo Ball MCW   So not a ton, but certainly not groundbreaking/generational"
"Ok I think 17th is too low for the Spurs but your argument is weak af lol.   &gt;we're still one of the most recent NBA champs  Y'all won 7 years ago. Lamelo Ball, Luka, Booker, stars in the NBA, were 12, 15, 17 at the time. There's nothing recent about 7 seasons.   &gt;only 5 teams have won the chip more recently)  ...aka 1/6 of the NBA  &gt;and given 3 of our 5 best players all retired recently, I'd say that's expected.  Is really though? Lets say 2018, when kawhi left, is when your rebuild started. Plenty of teams have at least shown direction they're going in 3 years.   - the Hawks started their ""retooling"" in 16-17. They at least had Trae Young by 2018 and even if you didn't know they were going to go to the ECF, you at least understood where their future was heading. - grizzlies started their rebuild the season after and even though they're still figuring stuff out, you can clearly see where they're going with Ja Morant. - the Rockets, barely skipped a beat as they transitioned from T-Mac and Yao to James Harden (2010-2012/2013)   And none of these teams have/had the FO reputation that San Antonio does.  In 97 and again in 2011 Spurs transitioned seamlessly between Robinson and Duncan and Duncan and Kawhi. When was the last time San Antonio missed 2 playoffs in a row?"
"Yeah, if I was going to start supporting a new team it would be the Hornets for sure.   Super young, talented squad with a very exciting style of ball. LaMelo, Bouknight, Oubre, along with Rozier and a (possibly healthy) Hayward. They should be able to score a ton, and have some exciting passes and highlights. Should be a ton of fun to watch this year, even if they are going to be a playoff bubble team.   Also, it's incredibly lame to start following the biggest team, so in my opinion that should block out Nets, Lakers and Bucks."
Lamelo Ball should be top five. smh
Trae young and lamelo ball told me preseason is more important than anything
Lamelo Ball was right after Wiseman
"even more, the more rope he gets teh better player he becomes. The guy like lamelo is a pusher transition player who just moves the ball forward and even if not hte direct assist, can hit the hockey assist and just keeps the ball moving.  I can't imagine any scorer,shooter, or finisher who wouldn't want to play with the ball brothers.  In fact I think horneys and MJ missed the biggest marketing and basketball opportunity on not overpaying lonzo like they did hayward and bringing him to play there. They'd get crazy exposure and national tv, move merchandise, and both those guys play in a way that may attract more stars and talent.  No one else is going to charlotte."
"Also in the interest of accuracy, we don‚Äôt *know* that LaMelo was passing the ball; he might have been trying to throw it out of bounds to get a whistle"

I‚Äôve been saying it all off-season and it‚Äôs an absolutely scorching hot take to Hawks fans. LaMelo Ball will be the best point guard in basketball when Curry retires.
"There‚Äôs a reason why you‚Äôve never played anything close to NBA ball.  I‚Äôm not gonna respond to every comment downplaying this pass but y‚Äôall need to slow it down and observe what happened.  Lamelo looked off his target forcing the defender to switch onto the decoy. He then makes a no-look, cross-court, bullet pass to the chest of the target. And all of this was done in the air.  This is an amazing pass. You have to either not understand the difficulty on what he did or be a hater to downplay this pass."

"[According to Jalen Rose they did](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/03/10/jalen-rose-warriors-told-lamelo-ball-on-draft-night-they-were-taking-him/)  I mean they were probably scared he'd end up like Lonzo. I wonder who eventually veto'd it, Lacob, Kerr, or Bob?"
"Nba fans have the worst opinions. I haven't been active on reddit for very long, but I can tell 60% of the people don't actually watch basketball games. Had a guy trying to argue that lamelo ball is a better player than Ben Simmons."
I think he really helped himself by stepping up his game when Hayward and lamelo were out last season. His 3 ball looked good in addition to the athleticism. I think he has a good shot at getting close to 100 mil over 4 years in the open market
LaMelo Ball is who Ja Morant thinks he is
Lamelo Ball
"Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball, Damian Lillard, and Luka Doncic for me."
"The answer should be either a wing or a very athletic guard as rebounding is the key here. That's why guys like Dame and Steph will rarely record a triple-double while, for Luka and LeBron who play as PGs, it's almost too easy. Therefore:  De'Aaron Fox is the first name that came to my mind along with LaMelo Ball. Jokic is an unusual Center who can play like a guard so I'll pick him next. Paul George, this season specifically with the expected high-usage, can be a regular triple-double guy."
Watching LaMelo Ball is fun on a bun.
"Yup.   But at the time Trae stock was low because his team was losing, they changed coaches mid-season. Ja‚Äôs flaws were being put more on display too with poor shooting and defending.   Not to mention, LaMelo does have a lot of talent. He is a 6‚Äô8 athletic ball handler with a special passing/playmaking ability. Personally I thought saying LaMelo over Trae was insane at the time, but if people had him over Ja it shouldn‚Äôt turn too many heads (although I do like Ja a lot)."
I like to think Lamelo is playing arcade games with Benny the Bull because the set designer saw L. Ball on the cast list and just had to guess which brother it was referring to
"This Lamelo hype seems over the top. I admit I didn't get to see enough of him, but I think when a guy is Lebron or KD tier, he impresses you first or second game you see him. I think Luka, Zion, and even Tatum showed that.  I like Ball, but I've seen games from him including that play-in game and he didn't look like this transcendent talent like these fans keep pushing. I think he will be really great still like multiple time all-star, but media/fans want a Ball brother to be some anointed star so bad.  Also Trae had a great postseason that few young guys could do and JA is arguably a better version of Lamelo if you ask me. I don't think Lamelo will ever be a really elite offensive player though he looks competent to be one."
"And how successful is the team Brett brown is coaching now? Ben has absolutely fell short in the playoffs, on more than one occasion.  But that does not discredit everything else he has done. He averaged 15/7/7 this year, while also being the runner up for defensive player of the year.  He is a top 30 player in the league whether you like it or not. And there is nothing you can ever tell me that would convince me that lamelo ball is a better basketball player than him."
"Lamelo ball is not better than Ben. Klay hasn't played in over two years. And on top of those two, you can argue Ben is better than sabonis, Murray, Lavine.   Ben Simmons is a top 30 player in the league. Accept it."
"I'll believe it when I see what he does with Wiseman. That ball movement was so good last night. It would suck so much balls if they ruined that by playing Wiseman too much. Speaking of balls, LaMelo would have looked amazing in this system too!"
"Where did I say you pair them with a ball dominant player?   I said having better playmaking beside them, and him being a better shot creator would be better.   Think of it like this. If the Nuggets had their choice of MPJ or KD (ignoring contracts) they would take KD. If they could choose between MPJ or Lebron they would choose Lebron. If they could choose between MPJ and Harden, they would pick Harden.   I‚Äôm not saying put Lamelo beside them, stop making strawman arguments.   I‚Äôm saying MPJ is a great fit, but he isn‚Äôt a perfect fit beside Jokic (mainly for defensive reasons).   Since then you are now trying to completely derail the conversation.  If you designed a player in a lab to play beside Jokic and Jamal Murray, why would you make them MPJ over KD? Acting like MPJ is a perfect fit is completely ignoring defence and ignoring that great fits aren‚Äôt always perfect."
"3 young players of today I would like to play Jesus‚Äôs son: Jalen Green, Lamelo Ball or Ja Morant. Jesus was a guard and so should an on camera son. It should be a young face that‚Äôs ‚Äúup next‚Äù."
Scottie Barnes &gt; LaMelo Ball
"Luka cut his teeth in Europe.  I think you had Ball go through Australia's next star program, come out then have a stand out ROTY season. That got people's attention on that league, now Josh Giddey probably gets drafted higher than expected because of it. So interestingly Lamelo may have built Giddeys brand up a little   A lot of fringe European and Asian talent have now jumped on it. If Giddey has a good rookie campaign and a few of those fringe players can raise their draft prospects then you may see a flood gate break on young players going overseas."
This fails to realize LaMelo was already popular BEFORE going overseas because of Lonzo and LiAngelo?     Besides overseas ball ain't even the best alternative to college
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
1. Zion  2. Anthony Edwards  3. Cade Cunningham  4. Ja Morant  5. Jalen Green  6. LaMelo Ball
Lamelo Ball he‚Äôs so smooth
I think a lot of people underrate LaMelo because he's a Ball and LaVar's antics have gotten them forever labeled as memes
1. Zion   2. Cade Cunningham   3. Jalen Green (A lot of teams would of taken him #1 instead of Cade)   4. Ja Morant  ( Wasn't a great prospect was clearly ahead of Barrett though. It was a perceived weak draft class at the time which might have been correct.)   5. Anthony Edwards (At the time he wasn't unanimous)   6. Lamelo Ball (Dropped because of Lamar and Lonzo Ball nothing would of changed)

He started breaking out last year when LaMelo was hurt.  He just improved his ball handling enough that he can set up his own shots. His issue his first few years was that he could kinda shoot and really dunk but his handle was super weak. Now that it's average his entire game has opened up.   Don't discredit the amount of work bridges put in by saying it's all LaMelo.
"I wish y‚Äôall would at least watch him or check the stats before you start talking out your ass. He‚Äôs not ball dominant lol. Lamelo has less touches per possession than Steph and [his usage is low as hell for a player who facilitates the offense](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=USG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*10).  Lamelo is 10th in RAPTOR WAR, 11th in RAPTOR, 25th RAPTOR OFF &amp; 51st in RAPTOR DEF (which completely blows his bad defender rep out the water). By advanced metrics, he‚Äôs one of the best players in the league and he‚Äôs only 20. You don‚Äôt have to cope like this bro."
"5 game winning streak, double double, I think I love Lamelo Ball"
"&gt; He‚Äôs been given the keys to be as ball dominant as he wants Charlotte   Absolutely false, at least when Lamelo first entered the league. Borreago started him on the bench and kept him on a super short leash to start the season. It‚Äôs only when Devonte Graham got hurt and Lamelo started playing well did Charlotte give him more minutes and leeway.   Lamelo wasn‚Äôt given the keys, he earned them after he proved he can play. This is very much the opposite with wiseman who the warriors essentially force fed wiseman minutes even though they were a far worse team when he touched the court."
"He‚Äôs given the keys to be as ball dominant as he wants in charlotte though, not exactly sure what is raw averages look like with diminished usage on the warriors.   Not even denying is a good ass talent, he‚Äôs just not some Luka tier player that I would truly be losing sleep over passing on. I think wiseman will be a quality starting level center and lamelo will be an all star caliber PG at the end of the day"
Beautiful ball movement is just lamelo running around
East:  * G: Trae Young * G: Zach Lavine * F: Jimmy Butler * F: Kevin Durant * F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  &amp;nbsp;  * R: DeMar DeRozan * R: Montrezl Harrell * R: Joel Embiid * R: Jayson Tatum * R: James Harden * R: Bam Adebayo * R: LaMelo Ball  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  West:  * G: Steph Curry * G: Luka Doncic * F: Paul George * F: Anthony Davis * F: Nikola Jokic  &amp;nbsp;  * R: Ja Morant * R: Rudy Gobert * R: Chris Paul * R: Donovan Mitchell * R: Devin Booker * R: LeBron James * R: Karl Anthony Towns
"I can easily think of 30 players better than Simmons (I'll exclude Embiid from the list)  In no real order: 1. Lebron 2. KD 3. Giannis 4. Curry 5. Luka 6. Jokic 7. Harden 8. PG 9. Cp3 10. Kawhi 11. AD 12. Lillard 13. Tatum 14. Zion 15. Butler 16. Beal 17. Trae Young 18. Donovan Mitchell 19. KAT 20. Zach Lavine 21. Booker 22. Bam 23. Jaylen Brown 24. Jrue Holiday 25. SGA 26. Ja Morant 27. Rudy Gobert 28. Middleton 29. DeRozan 30. LaMelo Ball  Also Kyrie Irving if he actually wanted to play basketball  There is probably some you could make arguments for one way or the other and obviously fit comes into play so I doubt they're trying to trade for say Rudy Gobert, but I also probably forgot some players you could add to this list as well.  That being said you're also probably not getting a 1 for 1 trade for Simmons with the current situation. So I guess you hold out and hope the situation improves"
"I love both Bridges + LaMelo. The Hornet's do a great job of team ball movement, but i still think LaMelo is pretty critical for that.   When Rozier/Ish come in at PG it feels a bit disjointed.  When PJ/Richards cone in for Bridges it still runs smoothly just less dynamic"

"you're ignoring the fact that draymond HAS to have the ball in his hands on offense to hide the fact that he is not an offensive threat off the ball and the fact that kerr absolutely loathes putting bad defenders in lineups with steph. lamelo would top out at 15mpg here because of these facts.  &gt;I personally think you guys are just coping with the pick instead of admitting you took the L and moving on, but hey, maybe I‚Äôm the crazy one here.  yea, coping my way to my team winning the chip this year."
"I watch the Hornets a lot and trust me, he‚Äôd be even better on the warriors if I‚Äôm being honest. Lamelo is NOT a ball dominant guard whatsoever despite what you might think, he‚Äôs pretty good about sharing ball handling duties with hayward, rozier, etc. Literally imagine igoudala offensively but he can shoot and handle the ball if he needs to. That‚Äôs Lamelo. He‚Äôs so smart and adaptable I‚Äôm nit sure what offense he‚Äôd fit into.   Sure he would wouldn‚Äôt make your defense better but you‚Äôre severely overestimating his negative impact defensively. That‚Äôs like saying there‚Äôs no way Trae Young would get minutes on the warriors because he‚Äôs not good enough defensively. Yes tf he would, elite players that are bad defensively don‚Äôt get cut from the damn rotation, *especially* guards. There‚Äôs no universe that Steve Kerr wouldn‚Äôt be playing him by now. He‚Äôs too talented and smart to not get at least 25 minutes on any given night.   I personally think you guys are just coping with the pick instead of admitting you took the L and moving on, but hey, maybe I‚Äôm the crazy one here."
"&gt;Poole is a worse defender and player overall so lamelo would be taking his mins and role  Absolutely not, watch the games. Poole plays passing lanes without gambling way better, and is far more reserved. His biggest weakness is ball watching and Lamelo has that weakness but wayyy bigger. Poole is generally much more consistent on defense, and a part of it can be attributed to Kerr/Steph being so vocal about it and Draymond screaming at him lol."
LAMELO BALL
"Chris Paul, Jaylen Brown, Kawhi, Pat Bev, Lamelo Ball, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, Markieff &amp; Marcus Morris, Jokic, Steph &amp; Seth Curry   All of these combined should result in chaos = I walk free"
Curry and Poole are playing together and both get to play off and on ball.   I'm not saying they should or should not have taken LaMelo but it is *crazy* to act like LaMelo wouldn't be great on this team.
Melo was a stud his rookie year. He surely would have started and just replaced Poole. Lamelo and Steph is an insane backcourt with Melo being able to run the offense and Steph shooting off ball  Wagner is whatever but Kuminga looks really good so its fine
"Cp3 has no creativity? Maaaannnnn. Btw Ja and Lamelo are both good ball handler, Rondo was really good at least many years ago"
LaMelo Ball got nice moves
Warriors clearly didn‚Äôt need a talented big to go with their roster. They are literally the pioneers of the small ball. They don‚Äôt even have a good big this year and yet they‚Äôre the best team in the league. They didn‚Äôt draft Lamelo because of his name
"Why do they say wait till they have to play a good team.They  embarrassed the Hornets,Bulls and the Nets in the last 2 weeks and I‚Äôm probably leaving someone out because they won about 7 or 8 at home by over 20 points every game.There only loss was a close one to the Hornets.It was there first road game on a Sunday night in Charlotte where Ball went off on them.You can‚Äôt win them all it‚Äôs the NBA Lamelo beats you or the refs beat you."
"I'm sorry but if you think Wiseman becoming as good as Zaza Pachulia is worth taking him over LaMelo, you're being ridiculous. Also LaMelo doesn't have to play ball dominant at all. He's taking a good amount of 3s this season and most of them are assisted. He plays with Gordon Hayward who's a great playmaker for a forward. IDK why so many warriors fans refuse to even think about the idea that LaMelo might have been a better pick than Wiseman."
"&gt; With the best off ball star ever?  You want to turn Steph into a spot-up shooter now?  If we're having someone else playmake we have Draymond, who's significantly better at it than LaMelo Ball."
"&gt; LaMelo would obviously be great with the Warriors, he's kind of built for them.  He so incredibly isn't.  He's too ball-dominant. How the hell do you think a player who's useless without the ball in his hands fits into a motion offense?"
"Probably. The 2020 East all-star guards were Beal, Kyrie, Jaylen Brown, Harden, Lavine and Simmons.   Simmons and Kyrie ain‚Äôt gonna make it this year, so that‚Äôs two extra spots. But the other 4 will likely be there. Trae is gonna get a spot.  That leaves 1. And a quick check of ESPN shows the two high guards are Ball and Brogdon. And Lamelo will easily take that based on hype value alone lol"
"4 rings, 4 MVPs, 4 FMVP  vs  4 rings, 3 MVPs, 1 FMVP  I also think LaMelo Ball is better than Magic Johnson but don‚Äôt downvote me it‚Äôs just my opinion"
"Right now yes, Lamelo has played college and pro ball, and is older and is a guard. Wiseman ain‚Äôt played shit. Watch out because when he arrives .. LOOKOUT!"
LMFAO DID YOU JUST SAY THAT LAMELO BALL DESERVES TO BE ON THE TOP 75 ALL TIME LIST
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"

"Great comment that in my reading boils down to this. Rebounds and assists have a ""quality"" aspect to them. They are all counted as ""one"", a whole number, but in reality they should be counted on a ""0-1"" scale if you are a team trying to evaluate performance of a player and team instead of a fan. Is Russell Westbrook grabbing a free throw rebound actually ""one"" rebound or ""0.1"" rebound in quality? Is Blake Griffin handing off to Kevin Durant for a 23 footer actually ""one"" assist or is that better described by Lamelo Ball threading a backdoor pass through 3 sets of arms to a cutting Hayward?  Baseball somewhat does this cutting Runs Allowed down to Earned Runs Allowed. If I was a front office analyst giving my year end Powerpoint presentation to Morey on a player's performance, i would include a ""quality of rebounds"" and ""quality of assists"" category instead of just plain aggregate numbers."
"The usage rate point is extremely dumb. That‚Äôs not how it works.    Lonzo is an elite role-player, a Swiss Army knife. A spot up threat, transition playmaker, keeps the ball moving and while not a lockdown defender, he‚Äôs still a menace. But he‚Äôs not a player that can ever be a 1st/2nd option cos of his lack of handle and scoring ability.   Unlike Lamelo, who‚Äôs shown he‚Äôs got the potential to be just that. Elite playmaking ability and potential of a scoring game that Lonzo just doesn‚Äôt have.   Right now Lonzo might be the better player but Lamelo‚Äôs in his 2nd year and definitely has a higher ceiling."
"People got a bit spoilt by Luka and then Lamelo in the past 2 years that when cade, another big ball handler that was picked highly, didnt score/do well his first few games in like Luka/lamelo, they sort of thought that was it."
have you ever considered the fact that Lonzo isn‚Äôt capable of creating in the halfcourt or running a PnR offense nearly half as well as Lamelo is the reason why Lonzo doesn‚Äôt have the ball as much
"You have to take age and experience into account with these kinds of comparisons. Lonzo has been in the league for a lot longer, so of course he's going to have an edge on things like off-ball plays and defense.   People say Lamelo is better because he has the potential to be a lot better than Lonzo based on how he has been playing. That's also the reason he has such a high usage rate - his team sees that he is already exceptionally good and trust that he will get better."
"LaMelo has can do so much more on the ball. LaMelo‚Äôs handle, finishing and pull up game is better making him a much greater threat at all ranges. That allows him to compromise the defence and create more open looks for his teammates. Those three things also make him a better pick and roll player.   Lonzo has to play more off ball because of those limitations, his jump shot is much improved but he really has to have his feet set and can‚Äôt shoot unless he‚Äôs standing still. Until he develops the ability to shoot with even a little bit of movement his offensive ability will lack the fluidity that he needs to become more of a focal point in an offense."
- Gary Trent Jr  - LaMelo Ball  - Evan Mobley  - Montrezl Harrell  - Cole Anthony  - Richuan Holmes   - Grayson Allen  - Tyler Herro   - Dejounte Murray  - Jonas Valanciunas
LaMelo ball is the ugliest man on Earth
"When Rozier is playing his starting role next to LaMelo, he is a near-perfect fit for our starting 5 and I think he was statistically the most clutch player in the league last year.  It goes to shit when he's asked to create for the second unit and make decisions with the ball. It's like if you asked Klay Thompson to facilitate, it's just not part of his skillset.   Terry has had a rocky start to the season, he sprained one ankle in the preseason and the other in his first game back, so he's been understandably rough, but he's looked like himself the last 3 or 4 games and been key to our last couple big wins. I'll take him over Lonzo on this team, but I'd take Devonte' Graham at less than half price leaving enough room for a better center than Plumlee over either Terry or Lonzo"
"I could see Lonzo working well with LaMelo since he doesn't need the ball that much, can space the floor and is a great defender. Rozier can shoot too and take some pressure off LaMelo having to do everything in the half court offense though. Can't really go wrong either way imo"
"I always liked Lonzo. people gave him a lot of shit because [REDACTED] Ball is such an obnoxious ass, but him and LaMelo always seemed like good kids at the end of the day. really happy for him that he's being appreciated in Chicago"
We really watched the Ball family come all the way. Lonzo is guaranteed 100 mill+ in contracts right now and LaMelo is bound to get a max extension. Their family will be settled for many generations to come.
LaMelo ‚ÄúCrystal‚Äù Ball üîÆ
"Yeah I was predisposed on hating both him and his brother because of how obnoxious Daddy Ball was, but honestly they're both pretty likable guys. Lonzo just super chill and laid back and Lamelo is a big goofball."
"Bridges has been the better defender and way more careful with the ball. LaMelo has higher peaks, but way lower lows for the team."
"Wild how many people wanted lamelo to fail, they must be salty asf seeing him ball out every game"
"I mean, you said it yourself you're 11-2. Plus Klay's coming back. This is probably your second window opening. Wiseman or LaMelo wouldn't have moved the needle much true, but having someone in there as an insurance or even a trade chip would have been valuable.   Imagine if you drafted Ball and his trajectory remained the same. You can either keep him as a valuable rotational player or include him with Wiggins in a package to net you another star. Basically so much more options would have opened up. Instead you're forced to roll with Wiggins (good thing he's actually performing decently).  I like Wiseman but it really does seem his BBIQ isn't up to spec and will be a tricky fit into your system. But yes, let's see what happens when he gets back."
"there's gotta be a shooting coach savant somewhere on this coaching staff. Rozier going from the inefficient dude he was in Boston to the insane C&amp;S guy he's been in Charlotte is pretty incredible. Between Rozier, Miles, LaMelo, previously Devonte' Graham and Malik Monk, even McDaniels, Cody Martin... a lot of our team has improved their three-ball drastically after coming here."
Is LaMelo ball the greatest basketball player ever?
lamelo ball may never lose to the warriors again
[LaMelo Ball](https://i.imgur.com/4duw6eh.jpg)
We can't let LaMelo win this. Think of all the sibling rivalry it would cause between he and Lonzo. Dubs trying to keep the Ball family together.
Should have drafted Lamelo perfect for currys off ball style
Everyone on the Warriors plays off ball. LaMelo Ball does not. A ball-dominant guard has no place on the Warriors.  The argument that he should be coming off the bench would be a waste of his talents.
Time for Warriors to kill and squash Hornets like bug  sorry Lamelo Ball
"Brainwashed fans, maybe. Unless Wiseman comes out looking like a young David Robinson when he comes back, the Warriors absolutely dropped the ball when passing on LaMelo."
Luka vs Trae/LaMelo Ball

Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
&gt;  Lamelo and Steph both need the ball a lot to do what they do  Steph is the best off-ball offensive player in probably league history.. what?
"Warriors already have 3 playmakers on the floor - Poole / Draymond/ Steph. Draymond is the most ball dominant while Steph plays half the times off the ball. So LaMelo wouldn't be bad if he replaced Poole, depending on how well he can shoot, and can play better defense.   I agree though people are sleeping on Wiseman entirely based on narratives. There were a lot of reasons that contributed to his bad start. His potential is immense. He ended last season with a very good net rating without starters. This season he will have simplified roles. He'll probably be rusty from not playing but again, his potential is immense."
"Nah trust me bro, I‚Äôm positive Lamelo and Steph would work beautifully together. Both high IQ, both good off and on ball, both good passers, both good (or all time great) shooters. That offense would be gorgeous."
"I keep seeing this pop up but it doesn't even make sense to me.  Lamelo and Steph both need the ball a lot to do what they do.  Wiseman is a guy who doesn't need the ball and is a 7 ft presence in the paint.  Of course Lamelo is playing better because uhhh Wiseman hasn't even played yet this year.  Not trying to sell Lamelo short I think he is great, but he and Wiseman are both in much better situations for developing their career as is."
"He‚Äôd adapt and fit great. He‚Äôs a 38% 3P shooter and was 35 last year, so he can play off ball. Iguodala + Livingston handled the ball quite a bit combined; Lamelo could replace them, just with better shooting and playmaking plus major upside for the future."
"Man I don‚Äôt know, he‚Äôs such a great passer and he‚Äôs clearly very smart, he would have to learn to play off ball more but I bet he could figure it out. And there‚Äôd still be 15ish minutes a game for him to hold the rock when Curry sits. I think Lamelo on this warriors team would be mad fucked up and scary lol"
"I hope we reward people who are actually playing well this year with good teams instead of just the usual picks. I think top 8 teams in the east all deserve at least one all-star this year so if I had to pick 1 all-star from each right now it would be:  Wizards - Beal  Nets - KD  Bulls - DeRozan  Cavs - Mobely  76ers - Embiid  Heat - Bam  Raptors - FVV  Knicks - Randle  Then that leaves 4 more spots. Harden and Lavine should be givens here. Then Giannis is the 3rd spot here.  That leaves 1 spot that is up for interpretation really and I think will be difficult to pick just one of them: Butler, Lowry, Lamelo Ball, Jaylen Brown, Trae (I don't think he deserves it but will be in the convo due to name), Garland/Sexton (depending on how that Cavs are looking in the standings near voting time), Scottie Barnes (depending on how raptors look in standings). I think media will give this one to Butler or Brown even though I'd like a new all-star here."
LaMelo Ball
"Lol these American statistics...   Only the third in last 25 years to record some random numbers....     He's the first one to be named LaMelo Ball that recorded at least 7 games with at least 11pts and 3ast with both shoes on correctly while having at least 1 brother also called Ball in another club in an NBA, also recording at least 10 pts and 3 reb in atleast 15 games in a season.     there u/ESPN, beat that"

Lamelo Ball is far from a superstar
"I guess that's why they call him LaMelo ""Ball"""
"Over 40% 3pt shooting, those are Budy Hield numbers, Duncan Robinson, etc.. only the best specialists can do that, Lonzo is definitely not on that level. I think it's funny how the Ball family still have dedicated fans willing to throw crazy arguments to aggrandize their talent, JJ did it because he knew that would grab the attention of these weak minded individuals. It's not bad if Lonzo don't go over 40%, these are elite numbers as I said. 85% FT shooting is the same thing, etc.. And 45% 3pt shooting is beyond elite, Steph Curry could do that only one time in his entire career. It's not a sin if Lonzo doesn't have elite talent, that's what you people need to understand. And the same argument goes to LaMelo as well, depending on how he improves going forward in his career. Only very few players are truly elite, it's not that simple"
"Yes you can lol. Warriors did with Steph at the beginning of the dynasty when he was a clear liability. And lamelo is taller, longer, more versatile, and probably better off ball"
Lamelo ball
i feel like lamelo knew he was off and then made sure to get the ball to bridges and others in the clutch. opposite of what brook does.
hornets need to let lamelo have the ball more
"‚ÄúNo he doesn‚Äôt, even he did.‚Äù Uh so does he or doesn‚Äôt he? Are you agreeing or not? Lol. The question is about fit. And the warriors don‚Äôt need him to shoot threes. They already have two franchise players for that. Lamelo has not shown he is a willing player off ball (the harden and lillard syndrome). The warriors don‚Äôt need him making one pass then standing there.   What the warriors need is a center who is a rim runner and has potential to protect the rim. Looney is not a shabby player so wiseman not being able to out play him at this stage of his career is perfectly fine. As of recently, looney locked up KAT, who most people rate as one of the most gifted centers and who Zach Lowe thinks is the most gifted offensive center ever or at least have the potential to be.   Your point of wiseman being the reason the raptors scored a lot is laughable. Lamelo was also on a hornets team that lost to the pacers in the playoffs."
No he can‚Äôt. People on Reddit really overrated lamelo. He‚Äôs a black hole defensively right now and he doesn‚Äôt cut or make plays off the ball on offense.
"You haven‚Äôt watched LaMelo if you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs already a great offball player. Kerr mentioned it in his pregame interview, LaMelo is one of the very PGs in the league who is not ball dominant."
Yeah even KD said on JJ reddick‚Äôs podcast it‚Äôs not even about who‚Äôs the PG - the guy with the ball is the PG and he even just calls him ‚Äúthe Initiator‚Äù   Personally I think lamelo would‚Äôve worked well for the Dubs
Dray plays a lot of point. Lamelo would need to learn to play off ball for that team to be elite.
He‚Äôs always been an underrated defender in the sense that most people like to pretend that‚Äôs he‚Äôs awful. The truth is he‚Äôs an okay defender. You just couldn‚Äôt put him on the floor together with a guy like Monta Ellis or Lamelo ball. He needs size around him.

"Trade idea: Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey for Gordon Hayward?   Hornets desperately need defense and a bench guard. Hayward doesn't fit their timeline but Ben and Maxey do. Ben provides secondary ball handling on top of Lamelo and elevates their defense. Maxey helps them off the bench.   Meanwhile the Sixers get a SF that's a little older but he's a jack of all trades who slots in seamlessly, elevating their level of play. Seth/Green/Hayward/Harris/Embiid is really damn good.   Thoughts? Does one of the teams need to throw in draft capital?"
Or Wiseman over LaMelo Ball.
"Lamelo is literally a ball, nothing out bounces a ball"

His brother Lonzo Ball was a high school senior and soon to graduate.  LaMelo wasn‚Äôt yet old enough to play on the  high school team. So family petitioned to have LaMelo‚Äôs grade boosted up one year.  And then that team went 35-0.
You mean this sub jumped the gun on a player after his first few games?????  Good thing known busts trae young and lamelo ball are here to prove us right
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
"Grizzlies are a League Pass must watch because of Ja. Give us a shot sometime! Ja is insanely entertaining as a hyper athletic PG. He can get to the rim at will, tries to posterize everybody in front of him, but also can distribute the ball insanely well. He's a lot of fun and makes Grizzlies games very enjoyable. We play the Hornets tonight so you could get a really fun Ja vs. LaMelo game to watch."
"Bro I didn't even notice it tbh, I went from wearing Medium to Large then XL was becoming a bit tight.  Y'all wanna know what triggered the lifestyle change? I went and bought a LaMelo jersey off of a rep seller, tried that shit on, and it looked like I was wearing spandex no cap. I looked like a ball wearing the jersey of a Ball"
Ignoring the more obvious ones like Trae/Luka  LaMelo  Ball   SGA / Ja Morant -  both already have fantastic numbers and are the focal points of the team. If they ever get to a 1/2 seed i could see them getting votes
"No. I've long said he's far more polished than draft pundits and Sixers fans believed. Before this season it was ""he can't take care of the ball. He doesn't have good handles. He's not that fast (this one is from the draft pundits). He's not really a point guard. He can't shoot."" I watched him at Kentucky and back then, I believed he was right up there with the top players of his draft, Anthony Edwards, LaMelo Ball, and James Wiseman."
"Yeah no contest there. But Wiseman is never going to be worth the 2nd pick, over a stud like LaMelo Ball too. Hell, Haliburton and Anthony are looking like way better prospect right now given the small sample sizes"
"Uh no this is how it usually always is.  Guard take a much longer time to develop than bigs.  Wings are usually somewhere in the middle.  Guards have to learn how to run an NBA offense and bigs have to learn how to anchor a defense.  One is usually easier than another because defense can be helped more by other players but primary ball handlers generally are drafted to be high usage players from he get go.  Lamelo, Ja, Luka, and Trae just were so good it made people forget this.  Suggs will be fine.  The offensive numbers are brutal but defensively he‚Äôs been the best rookie for his position so he‚Äôs still contributing."
"I mean team subs are always echo chambers.  For them, the team can do no wrong. But it's really fucked up that they knew LaMelo was BPA but then double-guessed themselves, reneged on their draft promise and picked Bagley 2.0  Was it because of LaVar? Were they scared LaMelo would end up like Lonzo when all signs pointed to no? Because they're more stupid than I thought if they thought Wiseman was BPA when he barely played in college against kids and Ball was stunting on pros in Australia.   They definitely fucked up passing on LaMelo, he would have been perfect in Kerr's system."
"Gambling for steals = pick-up basketball habit and LaMelo has played a lot of pick-up ball  Shit, I'd call his entire Chino Hills tenure pick-up ball"
"I don't think he can. Westbrook is stat padding on rebs (Let's face it). Lamelo gets rebounds because he likes to fight for the ball, notice him not snatching rebs when there is already a guy positioned to get it, and does not leave his man to wait for an opponent miss (like westbrook)."
"Pretty straight forward,   1. Lemelo got fouled, it looked like he was passing but they gave him two shots   2. Carmelo was arguing that it shouldnt be a shooting foul and stepped into the lane after the ball was given to the free throw shooter which caused a delay of game, this was the lakers second delay so Tech 1.   3. lakers bench also gets a tech for arguing something, Tech 2.   4. Players line up after the first Tech foul not knowing lamelo had a second Tech to shoot, Refs tell everyone to back up for the second shot.   5. Westbrook takes offense and argues the second tech a little to long and gets a third one for not leaving the zone while Lamelo shoots. Tech 3."
LaMelo Ball is just Lonzo Ball with confidence
Lamelo is the best ball brother
Lamelo Ball is gonna be a borderline above average player for his career
"I said it once and I‚Äôll say it again, Lamelo Ball was the best player out of the 2020 draft. He‚Äôs playing well for charlotte creating, scoring and oddly enough he‚Äôs defending every once in a while, not every time though. He plays well with Gordon Hayward and Miles Bridges. He can also finish with the best of them."
"Exactly!  Why were Raps fans getting so worked up about Lamelo Ball v Malachi Flynn in the pre-season? They aren't even really comparable, but since the Raps have had some diamonds in the rough before, some fans got excited and loud when Flynn was outperforming Lamelo in the pre-season games.  It was lame."
"Nah, these posts are funny because Raps fans were loud and cocky in the pre-season when Lamelo Ball was not putting up the stats that Flynn was."
"""Lebron James makes the first free throw, and tonight we say goodbye to Mike Breen, who has quit after a long and uncontroversial career- oh they're telling me it was controversial, he was fired, he was me, Marv Albert, it was a three point miss and that is LaMelo Ball."""
"It wasn't entirely that they were hyping him, it's that they got actively upset at the fact that lamelo ball, who has been famous for like 4 years and was the #3 pick, was getting more attention than malichi flynn"
"Here to post that this is the best draft in a while . This sub will need a few years to agree with me but I see it . There are at least two MVPs in this draft . I‚Äôve said before all top 3 picks are generational talents .   James Wiseman is going to be a problem , The Warriors don‚Äôt have to worry about their franchise after Steph retires . They are set .   Lamelo Ball is a once in a lifetime player. Charlotte has their franchise piece , he‚Äôs the most electric player of the draft .   Ant man is special special . I haven‚Äôt watched a lot of him be he‚Äôs going to be a fan favorite . Considering the Wolves organization I‚Äôm worried about him , but he‚Äôs going to be fine   Everyone else in the draft seems to be doing alright , you already see rookies having high impacts on their team (Maxey, Haliburton, Pritchard, Williams). I think at least 8 players from this draft will average 15+ points in their careers , which is statistically very rare for draft classes ."
"He‚Äôs saying the NBL hasn‚Äôt really been seen as a route for an NBA top pick, especially before  Ben went to the US for high school. He‚Äôs saying LaMelo is the only NBA top pick in recent years to choose to go to the NBL as a route before the NBA and that he mainly did it because he couldn‚Äôt play college ball."
"Lamelo has impressed me quite a lot. Maybe i was expecting a mega bust but he's playing within himself, getting layups and obviously making great passes. If not for Lamar, i think everyone would be rooting for the Ball brothers because they are really fun to watch"
"James Wiseman has freakish athleticism, length, and Size.  Anthony Edwards has size and explode with great athleticism to get buckets  Lamelo Ball has the height with good lead ball handling, and his passing is elite level  Tyrese Haliburton is just good at everything, and she showed drastic improvement from freshman to sophomore year. He is older than James Wiseman, Anthony Edwards, and Lamelo Ball with extra time to improve his skills against good competition.  Tyrese Haliburton talented but those 3 have potential to be top 10 player in the league be the main guy on the team, but they have a lot of work to do to get there. I am not sure if they are going to reach that level. Whatever happen from his freshman to sophomore year Tyrese Haliburton gets it, and know what to do on the court with his abilities with almost any situation. To me his potential is Malcolm Brogden."
Poor mans Lamelo Ball
"Legit nothing has indicated that Lamelo is even the slightest bit of a head case. He hasn't complained about his role once, is active and encouraging people on the bench, and teammates have all talked about how fun he is to play with and be around.  He's been as advertised as a ball handler and I don't think he has anywhere near the weaknesses some people think. He has also genuinely gotten better every game."
There‚Äôs more LaMelo Ball posts than Brad Beal. Show some love for my man Brad Beal he has been one of the best scoring guards for years now
"How is it bashing Rudy in any way. Randle is balling out against everyone this year, and it is just more impressive he did it against such a big and tough defender.   &amp;#x200B;  If a hypothetical post said something like ""LaMelo Ball scores 25 points mostly guarded by Kawhi Leonard"" would you read that as bashing Kawhi, or impressed by LaMelo's scoring against such a tough defender?"
Dude I just said LaMelo Ball was better than Michael Jordan. Get it together
"He's not projected to have superstar potential like LaMelo. He's seen as a top glue-guy / great secondary ball handler. Not a guy that you lead your offense, but help make it better.   He's not a guy who you give the green light to run your floor like Detroit did with Killian Hayes, but he's a guy who fits very well next to DeAaron Fox.   Honestly I was kinda surprised that the Hawks didn't draft him I thought he'd be a perfect fit next to Trae Young. But, the Hawks had enough cap space to sign a guy that's more developed and has the same comparison in Bogdan."
"Totally agree. The issue with going small with PJ is that their bench is anemic. Not sold on the Martin brothers or Monk tbh.  I think Graham is better off the bench as you said; Terry's an undersized shooting guard and playing him with LaMelo who's got the size to guard 2's is a solid decision.   Starters: Rozier / Ball / Hayward / Washington / Biyombo  Bench: Graham / Bridges / Zeller  It's not fantastic, but they have an 8-man rotation for the playoffs."
Calling LaMelo Ball Melo should be banned at least until the real Melo retires
I like the idea of starting LaMelo honestly. His size and length makes him a great pairing next to Rozier who's an undersized shooting guard. Let Graham cook second units off of the bench.  Starters: Rozier / Ball / Hayward / Washington / Zeller  Bench: Graham / Bridges / Biyombo  That's a decent 8-man rotation that can crack the play-in tournament.
"They‚Äôre just in different situations. Lonzo plays off the ball pretty often. LaMelo comes off the bench and typically gets it more since there‚Äôs less ball handlers off the bench. Lonzo is an overall better defender and holds the down the defense pretty well, LaMelo will bulk up eventually. They‚Äôre still both inconsistent shooters though."
"Despite having started zero games thus far, LaMelo Ball is most likely the leading contender for rookie of the year."
"Fck lamelo ball, wiseman and edwards. PP for ROTY"
Oh boo hoo they didn‚Äôt call your preschools LaMelo ‚ÄúBust‚Äù Ball for flop how will your terrible team ever win a game?
Lamelo Ball out played Trae Young and Luka Doncic in the same season seems like both teams lost the trade
Lamelo Ball &gt; Trae Young
Wow Lamelo Ball look like a scrawny high school kid standing next to Simmons. You wouldn‚Äôt even think they play the same position
Someone has been watching their Lamelo Ball tape
Trae young is no lamelo ball that‚Äôs for sure
Oh! A spectacular move by LaMelo Ball!
"When you watch him remind yourself: he‚Äôs 6‚Äô8.  The premise of the big point guard has been overstated bc a lot of SGs just play 1, or big guys who are just above average ball handlers are called point guards  Lamelo is a legit point guard and moves like a guard at 6‚Äô8‚Äîwe‚Äôve seen with our own eyes he was only 6ft as a freshman so he moves fluid.   So that‚Äôs why"
"bias ass refs lol, joel embiid literally fell from lamelo ball and gordon hayward touching him these past two games  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRqBHBDj7L8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRqBHBDj7L8)"
"I‚Äôm sorry what? I‚Äôm talking about the instagram post and not Lamelo Ball himself and it was at the end of the game, where no shot was needed."
Edwards- dwyane wade/anthony masons  Wiseman- anthony randolph/marvin bagley  Lamelo ball- jason williams  Payton pritchard- muggsy bogues  Immanuel quickly- lou williams  Tyrese haliburton- george hill
Steph Curry‚Äôs MVP run and Lamelo Ball vs Trae Young are Prime watches for me
1. Lamelo ball 2. Lonzo ball
"Dudes a bum, you are saying he hustles, lots of dudes can do that for a lot less money. Lamelo Ball scores more points a game than he does."
"it‚Äôs Carmelo, Melo is LaMelo Ball"
"I‚Äôm sorry bro but it‚Äôs biyombo he‚Äôs so bad, he fumbled the ball like 10 times last night lamelo would have like 10 assists a game if he had hands"
If I pay double that can I be acting GM? I‚Äôll trade the entire farm for Marvin bagley and lamelo ball so we can get a coach lavar vs a coach bagley situation
MVP: Paul George MIP: Christian Wood ROTY: LaMelo Ball DPOY: Joel Embiid FINALS: Lakers/Bucks Champs: Lakers FMVP: LeBron
"Lamelo ball, obviously"
"All the haters are going to downvote this, but LaMelo Ball is the correct answer.  We're 7 games in and he's already displaced Devonte Graham in the lineup.  That Ball Boy Coming."
LaMelo once the Hornets make the inevitable decision to play him as a starter instead of Devonte. It's an imperfect stat but I'm using it since he was given minimal minutes to begin the year..Per 36 minutes Ball has averaged 17/7/7 and 2.8 steals per game.    Wiseman is good but he's going to largely be spoon fed by an MVP while LaMelo is going to be doing it without that type of support.

LaMelo Ball has been very good too. Between those 3 for me so far.
Lamelo ball is the modern day Magic dont @ me.
"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
"The game all star LaMelo Ball decided to show up, obviously   Also, Bulls without Luka and KP so I‚Äôll give that a pass"
Lamelo keeps trying to hit him down low and I really don‚Äôt think this man can move and catch the ball at the same time. And forget catching and jumping simultaneously.. so many missed oops that he then can‚Äôt finish
"Except we've actually been better with Graham on the floor despite his bad shooting.  [link](https://www.atthehive.com/2021/1/4/22212699/its-time-for-the-charlotte-hornets-to-shake-up-the-lineup-lamelo-ball-devonte-graham)  I know the inclination is to start Ball because he's flashy and DeVonte has been shooting like ass, but we're still better with him on the floor. If he starts shooting worth a fuck, the difference will be even greater. I know it'll be LaMelo's starting job at some point, but I don't think that time is right now despite Graham playing like ass."
(pre-injury) Jonathan Isaac   Tyrese Haliburton   Lamelo Ball   Ja Morant   Dame   Draymond   Coby White   Aleksej Poku≈°evski    Zion   Anthony Edwards   Jarrett Allen   Seth Curry
"The Lopezes instead of the Zellers  A starting 5 of   Steph, Jrue, Lonzo/LaMelo, Giannis, Brook would be lethal  and then off the bench there's Seth, the other Ball bro, the Morrii, and RoLo? That's a pretty good roster. But also just Giannis and Steph would be broken, nearing Steph + KD broken"
"Lonzo Ball  LaMelo Ball  Notice how their last name is singular, indicating the presence of only one ‚Äòball‚Äô, or testicle."
Think you might be a little hyperbolic if you think the entire NBA world is watching for lamelo ball
Goodness can you imagine Lonzo/lamelo facilitating for Steph running out off ball and Giannis pick and rolls?
Why the hell isn't Lamelo getting any touches? Entire NBA world is tuned in to watch this guy and the Hornets dont give him the ball
"True. What is the starting 5 you'd prefer then? You want to give Ball minutes, but Graham is your best player. Rozier has better size than Graham to defend 2s. Gordon Hayward obviously needs to start. Washington, another young player that needs minutes and should start. And Zeller, the only starting center option on the team. Graham and Ball are not a good issue to have. Graham is your best player right now and Ball is the guy you want to eventually be your best player. If Ball were a better defender there would be no issue playing the two alongside each other. The way I see it if you're starting Ball at PG you're pretty much forfeiting half the season because you need him to develop. With Graham you have a much better chance of making the playoffs. But who knows, maybe halfway through the season LaMelo pulls to together and you guys go on a huge winning streak. I just don't think the odds are in favor of that. Lonzo hasnt lead a team to winning so I don't think it'll happen in his first year in the NBA."
lamelo ball is the greatest hornet of all time
They need to start Lamelo for entertainment purposes lol he always looks like he‚Äôs up to something when he has the ball
**94 LaMelo Ball**  **149 Michael Porter Jr**  **211 Cam Reddish**  &amp;#x200B;  did u pick these randomly lmao? this might actually be the worst post iv seen in this sub.
"fuuuuuuuuck that. Lamelo needs the ball, and in a lineup with Rozier, Hayward and Graham this makes no sense. They're all good play makers, who do their best work with the ball.  If you're starting Lamelo its because you want him to improve, and he's not going to learn much about his natural position playing in that lineup."
"LaMelo Ball is living that 2k MyCareer life, lottery pick on a below average team and still a bench player."
"This some Groundon vs Kyogore shit. Lavar Ball about to descend from heaven like Rayquaza next week and put them both in their place, calling for Jordan to sell the Hornets because LaMelo ain't starting."
A very small minority but a larger number than comfortable of these nephews have been saying LAMELO BALL is better than him too üò≠üò≠üò≠
Christian Wood / LaMelo Ball / Luka Doncic for all of them
"Honestly i would you agree with you if it weren‚Äôt for this simple point: some star names belong to players already. Like the nickname ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù already belongs to Carmelo Anthony but we‚Äôve somehow given it to LaMelo ball for no reason, and to top it off he‚Äôs only a rookie compared to Anthony‚Äôs decades of experience!  just my opinion though"
"Lamelo can come off the bench for his rookie year.. After this year, they may need to trade rozier or Graham AND make one of them the 6th man. Melo should have thr ball in his hands as the guy"
Lonzo as of now. But LaMelo looks like he can be the best Ball brother of the three of them.
"It seemed like whenever the ball was in the air, whether a pass or a rebound, LaMelo was lurking around nearby ready to swipe at it. I was really impressed by him."
"Really impressed with this team the last 2 games, a lot of people are going to owe Tobias an apology if he keeps playing like this.   Also Seth Curry is the perfect player for this team, he's so good. A lot of people are comparing him to having JJ Reddick back but while both are elite 3pt shooters their playstyle is quite different, he's not creating his own 3pt shot off Embiid dribble handoffs like JJ used to, but instead he's a much better ball handler and much more confident taking it inside. His passing and defence have been solid too, could not be happier about trading for him.  For the Hornets, I was impressed with LaMelo, I had kind of written him off as a meme player who wouldn't amount to much but he looked really good. Give him a couple of years to develop and he could be a problem. Also I don't know what Rozier is doing in his other games because I never hear him talked about but he always roasts the sixers lol."
"I‚Äôm one of those people who were extremely skeptical of Lamelo Ball. Considering how much we heard about how bad his defense is, I‚Äôve been pretty surprised. You always hear about his ‚Äúelite court vision‚Äù and it is indeed elite as advertised, and his passing is excellent, but I‚Äôm impressed with his vision on the defensive end - he reads those passes and he‚Äôs quick, and he gets those steals. He‚Äôs got long arms, he‚Äôs tall, he‚Äôs showing good effort - I think his defense will be fine, if not good or great. He‚Äôs fun to watch and I want him to do well."
"LaMelo Anthony, Carmelo Ball"
"You haven‚Äôt been watching his games bc Lamelo has shown himself to be viable off ball and a generational playmaker on ball (not kidding this kid‚Äôs feel for the game is elite. He does not look like a rookie on the floor). He has already improved as a player since his first game &amp; all the off the court pre-draft flack he was getting was literally bc the media despises Lavar &amp; imputes his personality onto his kids. His teammates love him &amp; he has shown he wants to be coached which is reflected by his improving on court play.  Lamelo is 19 &amp; the Warriors core is on the wrong side of 30. You draft for your future while also getting a dynamic playmaker who can impact winning now. Don‚Äôt discount what simply knowing how to play and understanding the game can do for a ball club. BBIQ of Lamelo, Steph and Dray probably make the Warriors a low seed playoff contender. Right now they look like a lottery team."
"Yeah and if you ask me, the nickname ""Melo"" belongs to Carmelo Anthony. To your point, he's been in the league much longer than LaMelo Ball."
Embiid half shoving and moving LaMelo Ball down low looks hilarious. Make you realize how massive Joel is.
I‚Äôve been a Melo hater for over 15 years now and still find this incredibly disrespectful.   Nevermind the fact that this kid hasn‚Äôt proven shit yet. Even if Lamelo somehow has a career that supersedes Melo‚Äôs - the name is taken.   The way Lonzo is playing it won‚Äôt be long before we can simply refer to him as Ball and everyone will know who you‚Äôre talking about. Same number of letters. Less syllables. It‚Äôs a no brainer.   For now - he‚Äôs Lamelo. Now get off my lawn!
"Crazy how people called him a bust after a slow start to his rookie year... I mean, people were getting tons of upvotes after claiming LaMelo ball to b a bust, so it‚Äôs no shocker... I‚Äôm just wondering when people will finally realize that young players take time to develop, even trae young needed some time"
The Warriors would just pass the ball into infinity with Lamelo. No one would ever shoot the ball.
"I want LaMelo Ball to be called ""el lmao"" because it's an anagram. Probably not going to happen but a man can dream..."
i guess i was wrong about ja but lamelo ball should not have 100 times more appearances than theo maledon when theo has arguably been playing better than lamelo
ESPN is always useful to test. Especially when it comes to their Ball obsession:  Boban Marjanovic: About 2.490 results  Shai Gilgeous Alexander: About 3.040 results Alex Caruso: About 7.880 results Ja Morant: About 35.000 results   Lamelo Ball: About 80.900 results  Tyrese Haliburton: About 2.820 results Anthony Edwards: About 43.100 results James Wiseman: About 34.800 results Theo Maledon: About 422 results Killian Hayes: About 1.150 results
Have you watched any Hornets games? It's been 5 games but Lamelo's growing as their primary playmaker/ball handler off the bench. You even see Terry/Graham start to defer to Lamelo because he's able to set them up at their sweet spots.
"I like LaMelo always going for the ball after a shot, but someone is gonna give him a hard elbow on a rebound some day"
Explain how Lamelo fits into a team that has Curry and Klay as franchise cornerstones as guards and Draymond being another playmaker who can't play off ball?
Lamelo has been super impressive to me. What I like most about him (and his brother does the same thing) is that he always keeps the ball moving. Lamelo has more shake with the ball than his brother but he shares the willingness to get everyone involved. Sees the floor differently than 95% of the league. Excited for him
Lamelo Ball easily
"Lamelo ball &gt; Lebron James. And it‚Äôs not even a debate.   You heard it here first, folks"
Best TS% off drives so far (min 15 TSA):  Dame Lillard - 72.3  De'Aaron Fox - 72.2  Luka Doncic - 69.3  Bradley Beal - 69.3  Kyle Lowry - 67.6  Kawhi Leonard - 67.2  Worst:  Ben Simmons - 32.2  Marcus Smart - 34.4  Russell Westbrook - 35.1  LaMelo Ball - 38.3  Donovan Mitchell - 40.0
"Same, been following the Ball Brothers for like 3 or 4 years now and Lamelo clearly has the juice and the structure to be one hell of a good ball player. The things he has wrong about his game can easily be fixed but his set of tools he has at his disposal already, largely can not be teached"
Lamelo Ball
"Youngest players to achieve 20 pts, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds in a game (in order)  1. Lebron James  2. Tracy mcgrady   3. Kevin Durant  4. *Lamelo Ball*   5. Devin Booker  Not bad company by my standards."
"I say this as a Ball boy stan that Lamelo also came in with nowhere to go but up, whereas Lonzo ended up being set up for failure. He is definitely hitting his stride a little more now. If he can stay healthy he could become elite in a few years of good development. Also, I am excited for Lamelo."

Like Lamelo Ball with pineapple hair
All three guards are very good.....good things happen when lamelo touches the ball though. Hornets have a nice little collection of players.
"I was skeptical that his perimeter scoring ability (or lack thereof) would translate in the NBA but he has surprised me. Lamelo has good touch around the rim, and is a creative passer that tends to be precise with his dimes even if they get risky at times. And he has looked comfortable handling the ball and orchestrating the offense, even if rookie guards tend to have problems adjusting to being part of the offense."
Lamelo Ball is visibly the best player on the court this game. I hated this pick and I'll gladly eat this tasty crow
Lamelo ‚ÄúJulius Giannis Siakam‚Äù Ball with the spin move
"Forreal. LaMelo might already be better. plus it's not like LaMelo is out here dominating the ball. He's playing next to Gordan Hayward, Terry Rozier, and Devonte Graham."
All I'm gonna say is: LaMelo Ball is
All I'm gonna say is: LaMelo Ball
Everyone expects LaMelo to be the best of the ball brothers. But most people don't expect he gonna figure out the game as soon as this. And there are still ROOOMMSSS to improve. future is exciting for hornets.
"LaMelo is what we thought Lonzo would be outta UCLA first year with the Lakers. Melo plays like UCLA Lonzo, fearless. All around offensive scoring package is lightyears further than Lonzo. Passing, just as good if not better. Defense, Lonzo got him but not by much. Players are excited, anxious when Melo touches the ball. Remember when guys felt like that when Lonzo had the ball? UCLA"
"On Lamelo Ball: Why are people so optimistic on a player who can't shoot, finish or defend ?      Lamelo has my non professional basketball evaluaiton alarm bells ringing. How exactly would he be worthy of a top 5 pick? Forget his father and off court behavior and solely evaluate his basketball ability.      - Bad defender - Bad athleticism - Horrible shooter - Bad finisher.       Is no one else astonished people are considering him a potential top 1 pick?"
"You aren‚Äôt wrong, but I feel like that‚Äôs a problem that could be fixed in through a trade or free agency. &amp; you can‚Äôt just draft for this season, Klay will hopefully be back &amp; in game shape for the start of next season leaving LaMelo as a consistent bench player. Obviously he‚Äôd still get a fair amount of minutes, but the Warriors were clearly lacking in big men this season too &amp; Wiseman should fit very well on a healthy Warriors roster.  Also, with Wisemans lack of experience I see him more as a project player. Full disclaimer, I thought LaMelo was going to be a bust, but I think it‚Äôs too soon to say the Warriors clearly made a mistake picking Wiseman over Ball"
am  i trippin or did lamelo just jump to inbound a ball?
Wiseman is super raw still so isn't really a fair comparison. Lamelo would also be getting a lot less time on the ball and it was before we knew klay was out for the season so it was better for both sides
"""Lamelo Ball with an outlet pass to Zeller"" is probably the most accurate description"
"Both teams feature scrubs. Apart from Wall, Rockets aren‚Äôt going to the moon with small-ball scrubs and Hornets without all-star guard LaMelo have pinstripe-wearing scrubs."
why was lamelo shooting free throws if he passed the ball?
"Oh yeah cause he‚Äôs a shooting guard lol go get ready for school and go double check your stats young man. Also trae young is a usual 20+ 10+ assists man. Chris Paul, Fox, lamelo ball, Fred van fleet lol all better team players then currys bum ass. Go back to beating off to his wife ya clown ü§°"
Lamelo Ball becoming an all-star is literally the safest take one could make.
"This idea is really, really, really dumb.  &gt;  I believe this should be a scenario where the Warriors should look to trade multiple draft picks for a more proven young player  &gt; RJ Barrett (4/4), Lamelo Ball (4/4), Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Halliburton  We should trade four first round draft picks, including a potential top 5 pick, for RJ Barrett or Lamelo Ball? Why? So the idea is to mortgage our future for players who don't really help us in the short term..?"
" &gt;The thing I don't like about him is that he requires a very specific kind of team to be built around him for the team to work as a whole. He's so ball-dominant that you can't just put him on any team and instantly make them better. I think guys like Shai, Ja, and LaMelo are going to be able to have an impact in a lot of different systems, so it's much easier to build a successful team around them.  Why are you so sure about that? We've never seen Trae play in a system with another capable ball handler. His teammates in Oklahoma were trash and the Hawks never had a capable ball handler other than him in his tenure"
"Lmao dude I was here for the whole draft hype process. I followed the draft.  People can give whichever players they liked better the edge, but the fact remains that it was considered a toss-up down to draft night who was better between the 3 prospects.  We hadn‚Äôt even hardly seen Wiseman play lmao. And Lamelo didn‚Äôt look like half the player he‚Äôs been in the NBA in Australia.  Anyone, that isn‚Äôt Lavar Ball, saying they predicted this kind of season from Lamelo is lying lol."
"I enjoy watching Trae, he's a very very good passer. But he's a ball dominant player, has had one of the highest PER's in the league since he was drafted and thus gets the benefit of that heavy influence his counting stats. Has he had a teammate on the level of Hayward? No, but Gallinari and Bogi are equivocal to what it was expected Gordon could still do at this point in his career, they just haven't been healthy. Also, defining Hayward as a 30M/yr all-star is semantically true, but is strange to define him that way considering signing a 30 year old 1 time all star who has average &gt;20 ppg once in a 10 year career was a universally mocked move. Dude is a helluva jack of all trades player with no real weaknesses but he's not some world beating All-Star just a very good player in the league.  I heavily disagree that Trae is an elite shooter however. He's just not. For his career he's shooting 42.8% on 17.8 shots/pg and 35% from 3 on 7.3 attempts/pg. League average is 46.5% FG% and 36.8% 3P%. He's in the peak of the bell curve for his shooting statistics. Trae doesn't have to be an elite shooter to be an elite offensive threat, which he is. He's a volume shooter and has offensive gravity because he'll take and can reasonably make shots with a high degree of difficulty from 35 ft and in. But an elite offensive threat does not make someone an elite shooter.  I also don't agree that you can't coach a reasonable number of NBA PG's in to put up scoring numbers like Trae if they were given the license and volume a similar shot profile as Trae. The assist numbers sure, I agree there you can't teach vision. The problem with Trae is he's small and will always be a defensive liability bc of it so his margin of error as an elite player is far smaller because of it. Whether he's better than the players you listed who are; poor, poor, average, below average, poor, average, below average, poor, defenders, doesn't really matter in the calculus for who is the better player to lead you in the playoffs, they all have more size than Trae and are thus less of a defensive liability in a playoff series when matchups are hunted despite being similarly effective or having gravity on O. End of the day Trae is a phenomenal player but it is far harder to build a top playoff team around Trae than it is to build a team around LaMelo because Trae's size and how it affects his defensive performance."
"The main thing I don't like about Trae isn't his defense, you can make up for by putting good defenders around him, and having a good offense. The thing I don't like about him is that he requires a very specific kind of team to be built around him for the team to work as a whole. He's so ball-dominant that you can't just put him on any team and instantly make them better. I think guys like Shai, Ja, and LaMelo are going to be able to have an impact in a lot of different systems, so it's much easier to build a successful team around them."
"Lamelo has lower usage as a PG because there are other ball handlers. I mean, dudes not even the best player on his own team"
"Absolutely. LaMelo is now in a similar position that Luka got to in Dallas: rookie primary ball-handler with all the leeway to make mistakes and learn that he could ask for.  Coaching staff, player development ability, good training facilities, and FO attitude are now the factors that will heavily influence Melo's development. Obviously, the kid's own hard work and focus will be the biggest factors in how quickly he improves. I really want to see what kind of jump he'll show us and how soon."
LaMelo Ball? /s
Would LaMelo have developed into an all star by next year if he had to cede the lion share of ball handling to Steph? Not so sure. I agree with talent over fit in most cases... but it‚Äôs hard to ignore how much better of a fit Wiseman is in Golden State. They don‚Äôt really have a quality center without him.
you were confused by LMB in a post about LaMelo Ball?
Lamelo Ball - 2021
"The way he justified it was because both Trae and Ja needs the offense to focus solely on them. While LaMelo can impact winning just by his playmaking, size on defense, and off-ball activity."
That if ur judging lamelo to be under wiseman on draft night you gotta remember that there was more video on ball as an elite ball handler than wiseman taking a dribble.
LaMelo ball is an athletic 6‚Äô11 point guard
"Also, Tyreke was always shitty without the ball. He needs decent usage to be effective. Lamelo is doing this on a team with other good ball-handlers and it's clear he can contribute in multiple ways."
He's scoring 25ppg with historic efficiency for a player his age and he's complete mismatch for just about any defender. Plus NOLA is starting to tap into his playmaking potential as a ball handler. He really feels like the second coming of Barkley.   And I am the first to admit I was totally wrong in my predictions for Lamelo. He's been fantastic and any franchise would be lucky to have a player that gifted. But Zion is just an absolute freak. They only thing I'm worried about is his health.
"I know, I'm saying Wiseman isn't, and nobody really thought he would be. Which means to be the #2 pick he needs to be a transformative defender, and he really isn't that, either.  But also, LaMelo is hitting 40% on catch-and-shoot 3s. He can play off-ball on some possessions and still provide value as a floor spacer."
"Are they though? LaMelo's forced his way into a starting lineup on a Hornets team with plenty of talented ball-handlers. Meanwhile, Wiseman's been benched on a Warriors team that's desperate for some production at the 5.  It's inexcusable that the Warriors knew LaMelo was the more talented player but still passed on him because Wiseman was the ""better fit""."
Our Center mitch robinson had the same issues. His first two years he couldn't stay out of foul trouble for the life of him. This year he seems to have figured it out  and is averaging 30mpg. Mitch also didnt play college ball similiar to Wiseman who played like 2-3 games before becoming ineligble.  I think it takes a while to get used to the speed especially at the C position where you are expected to be the anchor of the defense. He is def more offensively polished than most big men coming into the league at his age. Draymond is a great mentor for him and while his impact may not be immediate as Lamelo I think long term he will pan out. I just think its too early and not fair to Wiseman to judge off half a season
They basically said they valued wiseman slightly less but they needed a center so they drafted him which makes sense. Wiseman was going to get guaranteed minutes aswell while lamelo was going to get a lot less development time especially considering how off ball heavy the warriors are
Lamelo Ball has played 1010 total minutes. Ja Morant has played 770. What are you talking about???
"Let me rephrase. Players I would take over LaMelo Ball:  Luka, Zion, Tatum, Ja, Trae, Shai and Bam."
&gt;&gt;Dude can ball  Lamelo to the Warriors??
"While Trae Young is a better player rn, I‚Äôd take Lamelo over him. He‚Äôs a better PG, has proven he can play off ball (even though ATL hasn‚Äôt given Trae the opportunity to show he can play off ball) &amp; Melo is 6‚Äô7 to Traes 6‚Äô1.   As for Ja, Dudes at 23% on 3 attempts per game from 3. Maybe it‚Äôs a fluke year &amp; he‚Äôll probably improve on that but I have a hard time going with that guy when the Melo since starting is averaging better numbers all around that‚Äôs Ja."
"He also got drafted into a situation where people were desperate for him to be the savior, and it was in the same city he played college ball etc so the hype/hopes were unrealistic.   Having watched quite a lot of his games dating back to summer league, he is definitely a rhythm and confidence player more than most. He had a few holes in his offensive game from the jump, but when he was confident he was able to push through/work around those a bit and still make an impact.   Once he started being unsure of himself though his holes were magnified. He was even worse finishing at the rim than his actual abilities would suggest, because he would either be super rushed or driving with the intent to pass because he wasn‚Äôt confident in his finishing or FT shooting. He wasn‚Äôt shooting confidently either.   He was on a tear last year, and then...looked like TRASH in the bubble, and again it was because he wasn‚Äôt in rhythm. He started semi slow this year, and now has hit a pretty good stride and you‚Äôre starting to see the improvements in his game. He‚Äôs gotten better at finishing at the rim at his own pace rather than rushing it. He‚Äôs shooting free throws at a better clip. His shot form and confidence has improved a ton and he‚Äôs turned into a pretty good 3 Pt shooter. And now he‚Äôs incorporating 12-15 foot pull-ups as well that he rarely even attempted or hit on a couple years ago.   He still really needs to improve his handles, which I‚Äôm surprised he hasn‚Äôt done yet. Part of my optimism for him initially was that he would play with the same confidence that Lamelo has shown and eventually improve his handles. Even if he‚Äôs not the star a lot of us expected he‚Äôs still shown he can be a very good player."
"I mean, LaMelo was always the higher ceiling guy, Wiseman just had the lowest floor and the Warriors needed a big. it's not Wiseman's faults he went ahead of Ball, so I don't get why people are being so hard on him."
Lamelo is an Elite on ball player along with Klay and Steph who are two elite off ball players. Lamelo‚Äôs playmaking along with his scoring would make that warriors offense virtually unstoppable like how he‚Äôs succeeded in Charlotte with multi guard lineups. But now the warriors are wasting prime Curry having a 2 win difference on the hornets
"Is he on crack? Trae Young is far, far better than LaMelo Ball and has far more potential."
LaMelo Ball
"Ball played for¬†Chino Hills High School¬†in¬†California, where he won a state championship and achieved national success as a junior with his brothers¬†Lonzo, and¬†LaMelo, who are both current NBA guards. A three-star¬†recruit¬†and¬†UCLA¬†signee, he decided to forgo college basketball after being suspended for shoplifting in China before the¬†2017‚Äì18 season.¬†"
"&gt;, such as Lamelo having to share the ball with Curry as an issue  This part I could see the reasoning for (though I don't think it would be a problem since Curry is amazing off-ball), but it's when Klay comes up that I just think it's not even a problem.  And I get what you're saying about Klay defensively, but the reality is every player ages (unfortunately) and wings tend to age up a position if anything (the ones who stay in the league anyway): 2s become 3s, 3s become 4s, since they usually can't keep up with the smaller guys anymore.  None of this is a knock on Wiseman - I don't even really know enough about him to judge. I just mean in regards to fit even with conversations about guys like D'lo, like you said."
"When we got  D'Lo there was this discussion about putting Klay to play as SF but IMO that would take some of his strengths at defense against guards. Look, I'm no genius to talk about basketball, for real, but I can understand their reasonings, such as Lamelo having to share the ball with Curry as an issue, I mean for both players; not knowing whether Klay would fit in another position and how he's gonna return and I mean, it's not like Wisemann's been bad, the guy went from high school to the NBA and showed a lot of physical dominance, imagine when he gets the experience and knowledge from guys like Dray and Looney and also gets stronger. He's got a bright future while also being, hopefully, able to deliver for the team while our stars can still play for the title.      With all of this being said, people also need to consider that, had he played in college and showed his skills, the guy COULD've been the #1 at draft. I get that Lamelo is being very good that early on his career, but that's still the first year for both, so let's not compare this to situations like Portland not drafting Michael Jordan or Timberwolves missing Curry"
"TIL Lamelo Ball is also German rapper, Problem. WHAAAAAAAAAAT"
"LaMelo ""Is Problem"" Ball"
"I'd take LaMelo Ball going forward because I think he has the type of game that will make exponential leaps going forward over the next few years. Morant is nowhere near his potential, but I think peak Morant won't be as impactful as Melo."
"""I'm your favorite player's mom's favorite player.""   \-Lamelo Ball"
"Would a great passer who can generate his own offense have helped them? Yes, absolutely. Imagine GS's second unit if they had someone competent running the team. With either LaMelo or Draymond in at all times, they'd have excellent ball movement."
"LaMelo played a good amount in Australia, so he has the experience part covered compared to Wiseman. Doesn't matter that Melo didn't play in college -- he was still playing high-level organized ball."
"&gt; If anything, I think the opposite of what your saying is true and we're seeing that skills (passing, shooting, ball handling) are more inherent than we thought which is why super skilled prospects like Trae, Luka, and LaMelo are outperforming the super athletic guys drafted above them.  Wonder when teams are going to start to realize this, the vision that those guys have is not something that can be developed, you either have it or you don't."
"I think if anything the names you just gave disprove the point your trying to make. All of these guys (besides Harden I guess) were considered to be elite passers before they even made it to nba.   If anything, I think the opposite of what your saying is true and we're seeing that skills (passing, shooting, ball handling) are more inherent than we thought which is why super skilled prospects like Trae, Luka, and LaMelo are outperforming the super athletic guys drafted above them."
"I don‚Äôt think he gets traded. He‚Äôs been shooting the three well, can play off the ball, and passing/defending at a high level. Most importantly, he has a really good chemistry with Zion on the court. Watching him, he fits well with Zion‚Äôs game. Lonzo is a restricted free agent, the Pelicans won‚Äôt let him go anywhere. It would be fun seeing Lamelo and Zo together."
I kind of want him to be traded because I feel he would make a big impact on another team. He has to be the primary ball handler like lamelo ball. BI likes to iso in the 4th
"Honestly no, if rebounding is your top skill ypu probably aren‚Äôt getting paid over 10 million. The NBA has shifted where basically anyone can bring the ball up, it‚Äôs why you get guys like Lamelo (who‚Äôs 185 pounds at 6‚Äô7) feasting on the boards"
Would a combination of LaMelo Ball and Carmelo Anthony be better than the total package that is Lebron James
I watch 3 games a night and when I have the chance more. The sport is addictive and that‚Äôs how I keep my r/nba takes so fresh and totally agreed upon. AMA  Most exciting player in the league is Lamelo Ball and his Hornets are the most exciting team.
Lmao poor bastard is gonna get DRAGGED for this . Maybe not though since sports media only seems to care what lamelo ball is up to these dsys
"Yea his NBL stats are quite atrocious. I think more for any player in this draft, it was very important to watch LaMelo's play because the stats weren't telling the full story.   His touch has always been really good and that showed especially well with his floater game and his layup package, even though his percentage on both were subpar. I watched all of his NBL games, and even shooting like shit it was obvious that he was the best player on the floor in most of his games and he didn't look out of place. His makes definitely felt bigger than his misses and oftentimes it wasn't until I checked the box score when I realized he shot pretty bad.   He has also changed his shot quite a bit and he started tinkering with his form when he was in the NBl. Lamelo has always used two hands to shoot, and when he debuted in the NBL, he was noticeably using less of his guide hand to shoot. He also had 9 months to work on his game, and when he released some workout videos before the draft, it was clear he had been refining his jump shot by using his guide hand even less and getting less of the sideways rotational spin on the ball. Shot was still ugly, but it definitely looked alot smoother and his footwork was a little better than it was when he was in the NBL."
"Rebounding seems to belong to the ""play hard every possession"" guys  Like Lamelo tries to get a putback dunk every fucking offensive possession, and if he doesn't he tries to yank the ball out of the hands of whoever got it"
"There has been controversy over calling LaMelo Ball ""Melo"". Carmelo Anthony has given it his blessing but have you ever gotten such a thing from David Robinson over DRob?  (Ariana and Giannis are both strong advocates of my reddit username btw)"
"Overall he's good. He's drafted pretty good, signed Gordon Hayward, who is the biggest free agency signing in franchise history, and somehow managed to convince Michael Jordan to draft LaMelo Ball instead of trading for Russell Westbrook. I like Russ, but Melon is obviously younger and fits our timeline more. That Terry Rozier signing is looking great, he very much deserves that contract, and he's built a solid young team.   I don't entirely fault Mitch for offering that contract to Trez. He is a young center, which we need, but obviously I wouldn't give him that money either. But small markets have to overpay to get people to actually sign with them, hence the Hayward deal (although I never hated the contract, and he is playing up to it right now)"
"LaMelo likely would have slid into Klay's missing spot his first year.  And after that, they'd just go to Curry and Lamelo switching off ball handling duties (not like Curry is ball dominant after all).  Then in a pie in the sky dream, Lamelo and Klay would switch off defending wing threats.  This was the everything going right scenario I remember people pitching pre-draft.  Warriors have been looking for back-up PGs / extra ball handling even during their championship run.  One reason they were willing to try making D'Lo work with Curry too."

Yeah after Lamelo I‚Äôm absolutely done betting against 6‚Äô7‚Äù primary ball handlers. They really succeed more often than not
"I agree they would be complimentary, My point is I don't know if it makes sense for the Hornets to target him while we're deep in guards and have zero size down in the paint.  Lamelo could play the 3 due to his size - yes, But I feel like he really shines at the 1 being the primary ball-handler / play-maker."
"Small ball death lineup: Draymond, Wiggins, Klay, LaMelo, Steph"
"He can have the same role he has now. Lamelo can play off the ball or on the ball. He‚Äôs straight up just a basketball player, he can make it work. As crazy as it sounds Lamelo would be one of their better 3 pt shooters as well. Even if he averaged 10-4-4 for the Warriors he‚Äôd be super valuable. He wouldn‚Äôt have to put up the numbers he is in CHA.   The Warriors are also a bottom half offensive team. Which makes sense when you look at their roster, it‚Äôs an awkward group. They could 100% use another player who can penetrate and make difficult off dribble passes."

"sure, he can shoot, play defense, run in transition, become a nice finisher   and his handle isn't good enough for him to be the primary ball handler, but if it's lamelo drives and kicks it out Lonzo is a great like defense is recovering let me get the ball and make a quick decision to drive and finish or kick out again, or make a quick read to someone else who's open"
"Kelly Oubre at SG is not better than LaMelo currently lol. LaMelo could easily play SG next to Curry, even now that he‚Äôs starting and getting more minutes he never dominates the ball. Would‚Äôve fit like a glove in the Warriors offense (especially when you could have the greatest shooter ever help him with his jumpshot problems). And on defense he hasn‚Äôt been a liability which is good for a rookie and he would be even better with someone like Draymond on his ass. Kelly probably would‚Äôve started at first but LaMelo absolutely would‚Äôve stolen his spot unless Kerr is stingy. LaMelo was playing well even with limited minutes and less talent around him than in GS."
"Bigs tend to develop the slowest out of all positions. Curry plays off ball so much (in recent games Dray is actually playing PG on offense a lot) that he and LaMelo absolutely could and would play together.  Wiseman's offensive game kinda reminds me of Ayton's - forgetting how big he is, doesn't like to play physical most of the time, fumbles the ball, etc. And he's nowhere near the defender Ayton was/is.   The biggest problem though w/ drafting Wiseman is that unless his game grows faster than any big ever, he's not going to fit the Steph/Klay/Dray prime lineup. By the time his game develops into being able to help Steph, Steph's gonna be 36+, and unless he's got some LeBron in him the timeline just doesn't fit."
"&gt;  they literally have no centers unless you wanna count Kevon Looney.  Developing big men, and especially true centers that can anchor a defense, get boards, set good screens, and rim roll takes time. Could've gone for a center like market (trade or FA) instead of drafting one that's a project. Wiseman's far more of a project player than LaMelo, esp now looking at half a season's worth of games. Steph really needs another ball handler that can playmake, and Wanamaker ain't it. He's a ""PG"" that occasionally passes, but almost always drives to the rim for a layup or to draw a foul, shoots the 3 (poorly), and on the very rare occasion passes. His defense is solid, but the team doesn't seem to need more defense. Once Steph and Dray come out, the 2nd unit (w/ either Wiggins or Oubre in w/ them) revert back to non-Warrrior system ISO ball. Wanamaker doesn't want to pass so much to the extent Wiggins has to drive and kick and also look for ISO scoring opportunities.  The alarming thing about Wiseman is that he looks like he has very little ""feel"" for the game, and his skillset is mostly offense oriented. And he has stone hands problem, which is something bigs have trouble correcting throughout their careers. What the Warriors really needed was a big in the mold of KG - a defensive specialist that could make an impact on that part of the game quickly while working on offense.  And dude did not ""arguably"" have 2 bad games. Unless the opponent is rolling w/ a small ball lineup, he doesn't impact the game much unless Steph/Dray are feeding him (like they do w/ Oubre) in the 1st quarter or he's playing in garbage time.   Let's say his ceiling is really high (we don't know that, but for purposes of assumption). By the time he's ready to provide Steph/Dray/Klay w/ meaningful, winning basketball, especially in the playoffs, they'll probably be on their way to retirement. Bigs develop MUCH slower than other positions, esp true centers.  Always draft BPA, not fit. Look to fill fit needs in FA or trade deadline when you got a talent like LaMelo. (Of course, this is all in hindsight because of LaMelo playing overseas and Wiseman only playing 3 college games before being ruled ineligible, then pandemic happening.)"
"yeah, the biggest difference really is the handle honestly   because if you just talked about their vision and passing, it‚Äôs probably the same level, but lonzo can‚Äôt break his man down and get to the paint to create those opportunities to show his vision and passing as much, and  lamelo has the ball on a string and gets in the paint constantly"
"&gt; at the end of the day the Warriors might regret taking Wiseman over LaMelo.  It's pretty likely already right?  LaMelo is almost for sure going to be at leas a fringe all-star for a long time, his game is just tailored perfectly for the modern NBA.  Even if Wiseman lives up to his full potential I'm not sure he's more valuable than what Ball gives you as a lead ballhandler.    If the Warriors had Melo whew, I think their championship window would be about to open right back up.  You slot him in between Steph and Draymond and have three creators in that offense?  It might hit a whole new level."
"&gt;Fair enough, from my point of view: Yes Lamelo would eventually start alongside Curry this season and could potentially be Curry‚Äôs understudy but at the end of the day GSW‚Äôs bread and butter will always be the Steph-Dray PnR. I think Lamelo‚Äôs development would be greatly accelerated when given the reins to run his own team and I don‚Äôt think GSW will be in the position to give him that opportunity.  The Warriors are 1st in cuts, 1st in off screens, 5th in transition, 9th in handoffs, 21st in isolation, and dead last in pick and roll plays. GS runs the type of offense Lamelo plays in under James Borrego.   The Warriors are 1st in points per possession on the pick and roll plays they do run, but it is not a staple of their offense. In fact, [Steve Kerr is quite averse to running a bunch of pick and roll](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steve-kerr-says-warriors-arent-going-to-turn-into-the-rockets-and-run-pick-and-roll-70-times-a-game/amp/), and they didn‚Äôt run a pnr a bunch even when KD was on the roster.   I definitely think there is room for Melo in their offense, and he has shown himself to be even better in the pick and roll than what was thought when he was drafted.   Although he is flashy and makes highlight plays, Lamelo is not a ball dominant pg and knows how to play in the flow of an offense. Even in the scenario of a Steph-Dray pnr, Lamelo is an excellent spot up shooter and can still be involved in plays.  Having a bunch of smart playmakers with vision is really not that complicated as y‚Äôall make it out to be. The beauty of having pass first playmakers is that they prefer the right shot over the last shot and have the vision to make reads that other players (Oubre and Wiggins) can‚Äôt.  &gt;Wiseman would thrive as a rim runner and his skillset compliments Steph and Dray‚Äôs game better. Not to mention no better mentor on the defensive end than Draymond.   Lamelo has quick hands and preternatural awareness on defense (his focus and effort oscillate), combined with the length and quick feet of a wing player. I think he‚Äôs going to be a good pg defender if he puts on weight and is serious about it, and that alleviates Klay of guarding pgs when he comes back. The skill set GS needs at center (rim runner &amp; plus defender), is something you can get on the market.   &gt;That being said, when rebuilding you draft for talent but when contending you draft for fit so I think both teams turn out happy.  The Warriors aren‚Äôt contenders this year &amp; they knew about Klay‚Äôs injury before the draft. I don‚Äôt think Wiseman will be what they need next year (true center who can stay on the floor 30+ minutes a night against the best teams in the NBA &amp; during the playoffs) to be contenders."
"I remember seeing the video of Lamelo with two fingers up before the warriors made their pick.  There was a thread on it on the /r/warriors.  We'd just gotten the news about Klay.  I was dejected, because I honestly thought, for about a good hour, that Ball was going to be the pick at #2.  I remember being sick to my stomach.  I made a comment in that thread, at the time, saying as much.    I couldn't be happier that the warriors passed on Ball.  Nothing against the guy, but thank goodness the team passed.  I don't know if they told Lamelo they were going to pick him, or whatever they told him.  Doesn't matter to me, they made the right pick, and that's all I really care about, at the end of the day.    I felt like, out of everyone in the draft, Lamelo had one of the top odds of winning ROY.  My top 3 list of ROY contenders before the draft were:  1) Obi Toppin - I legit thought his rookie year would be fantastic.    2) Lamelo Ball - I was sure he would be good right away.  3) Tyrese Haliburton - he was always going to get off to a fast NBA start.  The things I felt about the 3 guys I had on the ROY leader board was they all shared a common trait: very advanced skill level for their age, which should facilitate immediate contribution, and a lack of the rawness that could hold them back early in their career.    However, as we move out of the rookie year, and onto season 2, season 3, and onwards in their careers, talent has a way of always dominating the equation as time goes on.    Now that I've seen Anthony Edwards play a lot in the NBA, the best comparison I can make for him is a young Russell Westbrook.  Edwards has 98 percentile NBA athletic traits, and his peak years, once he figures out what he's doing, will be Westbrook-eque.    Now that I've seen more of Patrick Williams, I see his NBA comp as Paul George.  Despite being 1 year younger than George was as a rookie, Williams' stats are better across the board than George's were.  I think he's going to grow into a really great 2-way wing in the NBA, and I'm bullish on his career, and was before the draft (Williams was my #3 overall prospect).  If the choice was Williams or Ball, I'd have drafted Williams.    I've seen every NBA minute James Wiseman has played, as a warriors fan, and he's exactly what I thought he would be: all the talent in the world, advanced as far as skill level goes (shooting, dribbling, the kind of things you can work on by yourself in a gym), but very raw as far as concepts go (the kind of stuff you learn playing high-level organized basketball).  He still doesn't know where to be on offense, he still gets in the way of his teammates sometimes, and he still shows lack of awareness on defense.  It's not that he's not hard working, it's that he just doesn't know.    Right before the all-star break, there was a play (forget the opponent) when Wiseman was camped out in the paint, and big had the ball right in front of him, the big whipped the ball out to the perimeter, and the perimeter guy whipped the ball to a backdoor cut to the basket.  Wiseman didn't turn and contest the shot, because he didn't know what the rotation was, what his responsibility was, and what he was supposed to do.  If he turns to contest the shot, the cutter passes to the big who is Wiseman's man and it's an easy dunk, if he stays with his man, the cutter gets an easy layup.  He doesn't know where his help is, and he doesn't know what the right play is.    That's not lack of defensive awareness, it's lack of not playing NBA basketball very much.  It will get better in time.  That's why Wiseman's ceiling is so high.    Lamelo doesn't have those issues.  He already knows the NBA game, already knows where to be, and already knows what to do.  That makes him better right now, but he has a lower ceiling."
"&gt;Lamelo was seen as huge bust potential. He‚Äôd either be great or really bad, and clearly he‚Äôs been really good but you can‚Äôt know that at the time of the draft  It was knowable before the draft. They had two years of film from the NBL and Spire, and all the respected draft experts had him as the top talent. People focused on the weaknesses in his game instead of realizing that a 6‚Äô7 pure point guard with his vision, ball handing, touch, and feel are rare players the rare players you take the chance on."
Counterpoint imagine Lamelo ball on a fast break finding Steph in transition for 3. Adding another playmaker and having Curry offball is never a bad thing.
&gt; Rose is close with Lamelo‚Äôs camp. Lamelo was pointing up 2 fingers and mouthing ‚Äútwo‚Äù on his ig stories right before the Warriors picked Wiseman.  Which means *exactly fucking nothing*.  The Ball family have a serious history of trying this bullshit. The Lakers bit. The Warriors didn't.
"[Pretty sure he wanted #1, even Zo tried to get him that number](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2919068-lonzo-ball-campaigns-for-malik-monk-to-give-lamelo-ball-no-1-hornets-jersey)  This story of a promise looks legit. I wonder why the Dubs reneged. Maybe they really thought Wiseman would end up being a bonafide stud"
"Lamelo is not ball dominant (as in ball stopper) and plays within the flow of the offense. Charlotte is 3rd in assists, 2nd in passes, 3rd in points created off assists, 3rd in touches, and 10th in EFG. Those stats are indicative of a team that shares the ball."
"&gt; LaMelo only has the ball in his hands a ton if Steph is off the court.  Draymond?  &gt; If he's on court with Steph/Dray he's doing the Iggy role where he's being a secondary option like Iggy.  I don't follow, Iggy was never a high usage guy on any of the warrior teams"
"Lamelo isn‚Äôt a ball dominant PG, you clearly haven‚Äôt watched him play"
LaMelo only has the ball in his hands a ton if Steph is off the court. If he's on court with Steph/Dray he's doing the Iggy role where he's being a secondary option like Iggy.
Steph is one of the best off ball players in the league and lamelo is good off ball as well
"This, look at the lakers without a secondary ball handler. Team look fucked and went 0-4. Having a competent secondary playmaker is important especially when your superstar  needs to start load managing. Lakers with schroder looked like a different team. I don't see how lamelo wouldn't work as well"
And Lamelo wouldn't be that effective on offense without the ball in his hands.
"Edwards is a distant second to LaMelo Ball right now IYAM, but like... almost all rookies are bad. In 95% of the cases, even good counting stats come with poor efficiency and a negligible impact on winning. Very, very few rookies that are up for awards like ROTY actually help their teams win."
Haliburton is a positive contributor like LaMelo but for some reason everyone said that Edwards should be ROTY after Ball got injured. I just mentioned him to contrast their advanced stats.  This isn't a shit post dude. I'm asking a genuine question and you're being immature af for some reason.
"there might be a lot of new blood in the playoffs this year. 12 members of the Hornets were drafted (or went undrafted and picked up) by Charlotte since the last time we made the playoffs in 2016, and have never played anywhere else. We're not a lock for the playoffs now, but are a play-in team.  Malik Monk, Miles Bridges, Devonte' Graham, PJ Washington, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, LaMelo Ball, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller, and Nate Darling have never seen the NBA playoffs.  Hayward (Utah and Boston), Rozier (Boston), Wanamaker (Boston), Biyombo (Charlotte and Toronto), and Zeller (Charlotte) have been there before."
LaMelo Ball and Michael Jordan
"&gt; If this was ""Should LaMelo Ball have been the No. 1 Pick?"" it would have been on the frontpage by now.  If this was ""Should LaMelo Ball have been the No. 1 Pick?"" then the entire post would just be ""Yes."""
"&gt;He's scoring 18.3ppg on 16.6fga for a .503 TS% and doing nothing else.   Okay lets start with this one then. First of all ""doing nothing else"" he's been the #2 option for a good chunk of this season with KAT and D'lo missing so much which has been a role no rookie has been asked to do, second of all yeah his season stats look bad but he only started getting ROTY consideration after ASB where he massively improved his play. Since ASB he's averaging 23/4/3 on 54.7% TS.  &gt;He can't defend, can't pass, and can't handle the ball like they thought he could before the season started.   He's decent on ball but horrible off-ball but to say he just can't defend is false. He's an okay playmaker and ball handler certainly not like LaMelo but its not like he's a PG anyway.  &gt;Statistically, his rookie season is very similar to Dion Waiters.  When you include his post ASB surge no way.  But yeah there is no point in talking to you about anything since you know you don't actually watch the Wolves."
"I was afraid of people saying ""LaMelo Ball"" or whatever"
"Every time I say anything negative about Ant, OP dismisses me as a hater, but I honestly just don't think he has played that well this season. He's scoring 18.3ppg on 16.6fga for a .503 TS% and doing nothing else. He can't defend, can't pass, and can't handle the ball like they thought he could before the season started. Statistically, his rookie season is very similar to Dion Waiters.  He'll probably win ROTY because of injuries, but I legitimately don't see why any team would take him over LaMelo or Haliburton other than ""potential""."
"I also don't  get why people are downvoting this. J. Kyle Mann provides really high quality videos and more people should see his stuff. If this was ""Should LaMelo Ball have been the No. 1 Pick?"" it would have been on the frontpage by now."
"LeBron or KD are not relevant to the discussion. LaMelo and Ant are. They are playing in the same league under the same conditions. Ball has been a better scorer, a more efficient shooter and a better playmaker. I don't know why you're bringing all these circumstances up. They are the same for all rookies."

"He would‚Äôve done wonders in the NCAA for my opinion. A good college program would‚Äôve developed him. This might work out like it did with Lamelo  it could backfire. I feel like people underrated the impact the NCAA can have on a project player like Kai.  Also people who will complain about ‚Äúpay‚Äù. Kai is like kind of rich in the Philippines. His father was a ball player. He could‚Äôve done solid trying to the collegiate game out. Especially with the new transfer rules if he didn‚Äôt like one place he could‚Äôve found another.  I want him to succeed and in general, it‚Äôs a decent optimistic look he landed in a professional league. Just hope he is prepared because I feel he won‚Äôt get certain things that I feel he could‚Äôve learnt big time in the NCAA. A school like Gonzaga or any team in the ACC would‚Äôve loved him."

"The year is 20XX. De‚ÄôAaron Fox plays at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on the injury report.

The low tier peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leader of 20XX, the Sacramento Kings, and their army, the Fox monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Fox with one hand, and winning championships with the other. The basketball metagame has gotten to this point where everything is played out to theoretical perfection, so other teams pray Fox is out for the night, and that‚Äôs the game.  The leaders of the anti-20XX movement aim to keep 20XX from coming. These warriors include Trae Young, Luka Doncic, LaMelo Ball, and Cade Cunningham. They are all fighting to keep the apocalypse at bay, the De‚ÄôFoxcalypse . But their efforts are futile. Their silly stepbacks, thirty foot jumpers, slick passes, and height are no match for Fox‚Äôs raw speed, the only viable advantage in the National Basketball Association‚Äôs version of basketball.

"Sacramento and Minnesota? They have literally wasted years and years of draft picks! Sacramento is finally starting to have a semblance of something with Fox and Haliburton, but even Minnasota missed on Lamelo and that was last draft!

Which teams has had James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George come through in the past decade?   The whole argument of most picks will be mid to late firsts isn't even a thing! They literally could get the 5th overall pick this year! Heck the heat aren't doing too hot right now and could be in the lottery. You think the clippers pick will be in the playoffs next year if Kawhi ditched them this summer? What about in 2026 when Kahwi and PG will be in the latter years of their contracts? Not to mention the fact that Houston's picks for the Westbrook trade don't just end this year. Sure you have the Phionex, Philly and Nuggets protected picks in there, but guess what those picks can be used to leverage trades, get role players, etc. OKC has more flexibility than any team in the league, and they don't have to mortage their future on the present like the nets and clipper have done.   Sure they will have stars come and go and want out at some points, maybe even SGA (he did play in LA afterall) but if that's the case Sam Presti learned his lesson with KD walking for nothing. They either sign the extension or get traded. Presti has proven more than capable of retooling on the fly and drafting well.   Also, OKC was close to making the play in until SGA and Horford went out of the line ups and we started losing a lot, so I'm sure if you add a top 10 pick in there next year they can be right back in the midst of the battle.   Haters just hate because they haven't had as much success as OKC has had since they have been a franchise. I get it they never won a title, but hey 2013, 14 and 15 they were one of the top teams, but they had injuries and 16 they had bad luck. Had everything gone perfect they would've won in 2014."
Hornets because of Lamelo Ball.
"This season Curry has played off ball more while letting Dray handle the ball. He, LaMelo and Dray could've shared playmaking duties and probably would've figured out a good balance."
Why not? They all play off ball &amp; would work perfect with Lamelo. Curry-Ball-Klay is godly.  Ball finds every open shooter. Imagine how he‚Äôll find all these guys.
"Right now if you ask all 30 front offices ""if you can pick one player from the current Raptors and Hornets rosters to start a team with, who do you choose"", I think that the answer is unanimously (and very easily) LaMelo Ball."
"I guess if we think post Curry/Klay he's a good long-term fit. But as far as making the Warriors competitive again with Steph, Lamelo is a ball-dominant guard. That's just not really the piece they needed with Curry and Klay."
i mean this is the situation teams get in after having a 5 year dynasty and going deep into the tax.  if klay was healthy this squad would be a top 4 seed anyways.  the only truly bad decision seems to have been drafting wiseman.  warriors ball movement with lamelo man... cant even imagine.
The real question is would you rather have Malachi Flynn or Lamelo Ball?
I don't know why Knicks fans are laughing at you when the one who asked you about your flair seems to think you are joining in with their lovefest and that they have LaMelo Ball on their team. That's the only explanation
Golden State wont no trade for no LaMelo Ball lmao.
"If they package him and a pick, they could trade for LaMelo Ball, a promising rookie that went third overall this year."
LaMelo Ball
"Id personally put Morant, fox, and lemelo in a tier below.  All the other guys have made at least one allstar team.  Some of them multiple.  But this is is a hard list to separate and im not sure where you draw the line.  Booker, Tatum, mitchell to me are on a clear level above.  I think either if these guys could easily be top player for a contender. Then you have bam who i think could be great anywhere and borderline allstar but at this point had not shown that next level.  He reminds me of ayton right now.  Hes fulfilling a role on a team very very well and his production is all star esque but I'm not certain they could do it on another team/system.  Then the rest a little lower due to various reasons.  Lamelo has great potential ball averaged 16 and 6  at 57 ts at 19.  Thats great for a rookie but Booker has already averaged 26 and 7 on 62 ts last year.  Booker is already the all star youd hope melo would be.  Morant is in the same boat and then honestly who the hell knows with fox.  I never watch Sacramento games but apparently he's scoring 25 a game this year a career high efficiency.  So I dont really know how to rate him.   So in essence in order of mini tiers to me  Booker/tatum/Mitchell  Bam  Fox/lamelo/morant"
How are the LaMelo Ball-less hornets beating Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant????  &amp;#x200B;  Those guys need so much help to win.
"I see what you‚Äôre saying. I was up almost 500% on LaMelo Ball before the injury.   Stock price also goes up and down based off volume. So more people buy the stock, the price goes up. If people sell the stock, the price goes down. That is big during the playoffs and right after big trades/drafts.   They do NFL and NBA right now, so if you like football, get in before the draft and find value in rookies"
"I mean, using this logic nobody knows anything and we can‚Äôt discount anything... but we can make some pretty educated guesses.   He‚Äôs not really good at anything except dunking, which is not a rare skill for NBA bigs. He plays a position where there should really be no middle class, you should either have an AD/Jokic/Embiid/Towns type or go bargain hunting since the difference between the 10th and 20th best center is negligible and those guys are available all the time. He‚Äôs not contributing to winning now, he might be better than LaMelo some day but if you were offered that straight up you‚Äôd be nuts not to swap him and get Ball, and he already has a disadvantage due to position alone."
"I think they were preparing for the post-Steph era while still trying to contend. They ended up making the safer pick...and failed.  Good thing is that fully healthy, we can still be good without Wiseman. But we could have had LaMelo...fuck imagine all the fastbreaks and all the ball movement. Steph/Melo/Klay/Wiggs/Dray would have been potent offensively. Ball made PJ Washington look decent...imagine what he could have done to Wiggs  But still there's that Wolves pick so we still have a valuable asset"
"The Wiseman pick was decent tbh. If they managed to get the Wiseman they would have had a 7'1"" dude who could facilitate, shoot, and more importantly, defend inside.  They did pass on a 6'7"" point guard who's got a great feel for the game, already perfect for their motion system. Also amazing on the fastbreak. Only knock is his shooting stats were as shitty as his brother (then). I think this is what scared them the most.   Ball had the higher ceiling but lower floor...at least in their eyes.  But watching Wiseman he didn't look like he knew what he was doing out there. Sure he improved by the end, but Ball looked way more NBA-ready than Wiseman now.  It just pisses me off. But it pisses me off more that they originally intended to draft LaMelo but then chose Wiseman."
"Idk why Anthony Edwards, Lamelo Ball and Patrick Williams all being born in the same month is kinda interesting to me but it is"
"that's you, I never watched a single full Duke game while Zion was there and have watched plenty of Pelicans games  They would not get the same viewership at all, Duke has a crazy amount of established fans that care way more for the team than they do the players on it. College ball in general their fans are built that way.   its a fantasy to assume those G-league games would ever get the same viewership the NBA does, even in a best case scenario guys like Zion and LaMelo are missing out so much on getting to grow their brand and get better"
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
It‚Äôll be a problem for ESPN pundits imo. Skip and Shannon too. LeBron topics consistently get the most views even tho it‚Äôs the same topic every day. Lamelo Ball will probably be the the most talked about players post Lebron
Lamelo ball better
It's not a debate. It's clearly Lamelo Ball y'all are tripping balls
Even when LaMelo Ball is scoring inefficiently he's still bringing a lot to the table offensively with his great passing ability. He was a positive contributor to a team that was pushing for the playoffs. When Edwards is shooting 4/15 from the field he's not helping his team at all.
I don‚Äôt think the Wolves take Ball first in a redraft. Not that Lamelo isn‚Äôt better but we drafted on fit with D‚ÄôLo as our lead ball handler. Still think we‚Äôd go Ant.
I bet Lamelo Ball would be high on that list if he played the whole season.
"As the season went on, Edwards began shooting better than Ball. Heck even when Ball came back from injury he was shooting and playing way worse than Edwards, yet somehow that was enough to move Lamelo past Edwards on the NBA.com rookie ladder. How does that make any sense?   Obviously Hornets and Twolves fans are gonna respectively defend their guys, but as a Laker fan I just think Edwards' durability has to push him over the top."
"ROTY clearly belongs to LaMelo Ball.   If we reversed the season and Ant started out hot and cooled down y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt be mentioning Ant at all. The only reason why you guys are saying Ant is because of recency bias.    And it‚Äôs a joke that you guys say Ball has much better teammates. Ant is playing with two all stars (this season and/or last season) while LaMelo is playing with guys who were all said to have been overpaid and overrated (Rozier, Gordon etc)   You have to give LaMelo props for helping make the team work. None of y‚Äôall were saying Charlotte was a good team last year.  LaMelo changed the franchise and he‚Äôs a winner on and off the court. Ant just puts up empty stats."
"It‚Äôs not a game, you replied to someone mentioning criteria being used in the past that is obviously for a whole season and you counter with criteria for recent play.   However good Edwards has been since march, his poor play prior offsets that. Ball after the injury only  tanked his shooting a bit but he still ends up more efficient than Edwards. His rebounds and assists and defense is pretty much the same.  And if you need to know, ive been actually quite open to Lamelo losing the award because of his missed time. But make no mistake, Edwards isnt far away better than Ball just because he posted higher scoring peaks and made posters here and there. RotY is based on averages. You bum."
If Anthony's name was Anthony Ball he would win and it would not be close.  Unfortunately the media is gonna vote for Lamelo because they decided back in February that he's gonna win the award.
"I'd love to see a Ball^2 backcourt but I don't see it happening. Lamelo/Rozier compliments each other really well, and Lonzo is perfect for this NOLA team."
Im honestly struggling to see the case for Lamelo. Yes he was better than Ant before he went down. But Ant was still top 3 in the rookie standings at that point and was still putting up comparable stats.  Since Lamelo Ball went down injured though Ant has legitimately been on another level. I mean these last 2 months we are already talking fringe All Star level. He has singlehandedly won us a few games in that space and with KAT and DLo with him we are a winning team.  Lamelo has been more consistent but has come back after missing nearly 30% of the season and looked like shit. One of the ideas is that Ball contributed to winning basketball because of the Hornets record but the Hornets record is very similar with and without Lamelo. So that argument to me is void
"I am a twolves fan so I'm gonna get downvoted for being biased, but I gotta say my piece.   Until about March, I thought Lamelo was ROY and it wasn't even close. But the way Ant has played this spring has completely changed my mind, especially now that Ball has returned and had a lackluster end to the season, compared to how shit hot he was before he got hurt.   Ant has been completely dominant the second half of the season. For how impressive Ball's first half was, I think Ant's was even more impressive. Post-ASB, he averaged 23-5-4 on league-average efficiency. He's been putting up Donovan Mitchell-like numbers for *half the season*.  He's gotten better every month the last four month, finishing the month of May averaging 27-5-5 on 52-40-79 splits (or something like that, I'm doing it off of memory). Those are fucking insane stats, for anybody. To add to all that, post-ASB, Ant was THIRD in the league behind only Steph and Dame for pull-up 3pt percentage (min &gt; 50 3PM). He's gotten so much more efficient, and he's still not even going to the line a lot.   He's been a huge contributing factor to why the Wolves have won so many games post-ASB. These aren't garbage time numbers or numbers he putting up in nightly blow outs. He's able to put the team on his back and will them to a win (see: Portland and Phoenix wins in March), or at least into being competitive (see: Memphis two weeks ago). He's also made strides in terms of playmaking ability, ability to get rebounds, and defense, although his defense still needs a ton of work.   I can't take anything away from Ball. He's been incredible, and he's gonna be a superstar. But Ant took his game to a completely different level this spring. He could be a scoring champion contender by the time he's 24-25."
"Playing devil's advocate to your argument &amp; Lamelo contributing to ""winning ways"" : look at the hornets record when Ball was playing 23-28  vs when he was out 10-11.   I'm sure it's missing a lot of context, just as how Ant played most of the 1st half without the 2 only decent shot takers on that team, KAT and/or D'Lo."
"Playing devil's advocate to Lamelo contributing to ""winning ways"" : look at the hornets record when Ball was playing 23-28  vs when he was out 10-11.  I'm sure it's missing a lot of context"
"Oh for sure. I suppose it just gets frustrating hearing people say that LaMelo might only lose it because of his injury, instead of Edwards might win it because his last 40 games were incredible. Which is only 10 less than LaMelo played all season. People were not paying attention to how good Edwards became as the season went on.   Comes with being a small market. Charlotte is, too, but when your last name is Ball, the cameras are going to be everywhere."
"While true he‚Äôs not the worst or near it, we cant judge him for what he shouldve been, but what he showed. Lamelo has the edge overall, but i wouldnt be surprised if Ant won it just because Lamelo played 20 less games.   I honestly wouldnt mind them being co roty if ball didnt get injured and their averages are what we have right now. Great future for both players."
No sound but I can still hear the Hornets announcer screaming LAMELO as he does every time the kid touches the ball
Ok. And? LaMelo is still better by almost every metric and he has more than 3X as many Win Shares as Edwards. I understand the argument being made; what I don't understand is why Edwards supporters fail to understand arguments for Ball winning.
"Zach arguement for LaMelo:   I've heard from partisans of both Ball and Edwards suggesting the race is a blowout. Nope. Advanced numbers suggest a blowout -- for Ball. Edwards is 12th among 34 rotation rookies in PER, 26th in value over replacement player, and 29th in win shares. Ball is first, second, and ninth, respectively.  Those numbers penalize Edwards for taking tons of shots on a losing team, and hitting them at a poor rate (41% overall, 32.7% on 3s, 48% on 2s) -- and playing the bad defense we expect from rookies. They say Edwards' impressive traditional numbers are empty calories. There is a sound argument that Haliburton should finish No. 2.  But what would happen to basically any rookie working as a pseudo-No. 1 option for the Minnesota freaking Timberwolves without both Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell? That was Edwards' lot early -- when he missed and missed and missed, and his advanced numbers sunk into the abyss.  But alongside real talent, Edwards has exceeded expectations. In 35 games since March 1, he's averaging 23 points on 45% shooting: a semi-respectable (considering how many pull-ups he takes) 34% on 3s, and 53.3% on 2s. The Wolves are 15-19 in that stretch, and 9-7 in their past 16 games. They are a real team, and Edwards is part of that. You can tell he has earned the respect of opponents, because they often assign their best perimeter defenders to him.  Edwards leads all rookies in minutes, with about 800 more than Ball. He may unseat Ball, the presumptive favorite all season, and that would not be some sort of travesty. But Ball has made positive contributions to a team with real stakes since day one. He has been the better shooter, playmaker, and rebounder. His statistical edge in everything but raw points and minutes is overwhelming. Given some baseline threshold of availability, I don't prioritize minutes quite as much in the ""of year"" awards as in MVP. Ball wins here, but it's close. Haliburton is an easy choice at No. 3."
The thing is Steph Dray and Klay doesn‚Äôt have a few seasons to waste on this rookie big.  Should have drafted somebody like Lamelo Ball for instant support or traded the pick for a star Vet.
"I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been the most frustrating thing, it seems like most nba talking heads made their minds up about Ball after the first half of the season and won‚Äôt even entertain Ant as ROTY. Like it was a runaway race, but in the end it‚Äôs actually pretty close.   Either way, I‚Äôm not stressing it. I loved LaMelo coming into the draft and I‚Äôm pumped he‚Äôs doing well. Same for Ant. I‚Äôm stoked they‚Äôre shutting doubters up."
He‚Äôs not a disappointment because we had no hopes for him. We knew both one and two seed dropped the ball when they didn‚Äôt select... LaMelo Ball.
"But has LaMelo been really good all season? In the last 10 games Ball has a +/- of -44, shot 38.4% from the field, 24.4% from three and 66.7% from the charity stripe.  That being said (even as a Timberwolves fan) I think LaMelo had the better season overall. Edwards was particularly bad at the beginning of the season, and that's okay. As advertised, Edwards was a really raw rookie with an incredible amount of room for improvement.    Importantly, Edwards \*did\* improve every single month this season. That's something you love to see in a rookie.  Everyone likes to compare his numbers pre and post all-star break, but even before the break you can see Edwards consistently get better over time.   Ask yourself this, if we did the 2020 draft over today, who would you want to take at No.1 for the future of your franchise? With 0 reservations I'm picking Anthony Edwards."
"ROTY is Anthony Edwards not Lamelo Ball lol, and you can fight me however you want."
"Just based on a few writers and podcast hosts games played is not important enough to wrest the award from Lamelo Ball.  Jokic was about as good as Embiid on a per minute basis, Lamelo was way better than Ant this year (on balance, I know Edwards closed the year out strong)."
Yes Gordon Hayward is better than Lamelo Ball and Karl Anthony Towns is an awesome player.  What does this have to do with Lamelo vs Ant ?
"You can't just look at P/R/A. He is shooting substantially worse.   Shooting splits before the injury:   45.1/37.5/78.9 for a TS% of 56.2  &amp;#x200B;  Shooting splits after the injury:   38.4/24.4/66.7 for a TS% of 45.9  &amp;#x200B;  To put into perspective how bad he has been shooting the ball, Edwards TS% before the all star break was 46.6%. So when people were talking about how horrible Edwards efficiency was the first half of the season, he was still shooting the ball better than LaMelo has since he's come back from his injury."

"Crown Ball with it already. I want Ant hitting the offseason with a chip on those sizable shoulders. Plus, LaMelo too is a hell of a player with a bright future. My biased self wants A1 but I have zero problem with Ball winning."
Why doesn‚Äôt Lamelo get the ball in these situations tf
why doe lamelo not have the ball??
Lamelo can ball
Hornets record with Ball: 23-27  Hornets record without Ball: 10-11  ANT was on a terrible team with KAT and Dlo out (not to mention a terrible coach) while Lamelo was on a much better team.
"If you look at the entire season, LaMelo is averaging 15/6/6 on 54% TS. Edwards is averaging 19/4/2 on 52% TS. All the advanced stats scream LaMelo as well. This is all including the recent good stretch by Edwards and the recent poor stretch by Ball.   Unless you have a hard cutoff for games played, Ball has a very good case."
Hornets record with Lamelo Ball: 23-27  Hornets record without Lamelo Ball: 10-11
like Lamelo Ball will let that happen
Lamelo Ball is just so good
&gt; Also even before the injury he wasn't that much ahread of Ant.  Just admit that you don't actually know what you're talking about and have the memory of a goldfish. Edwards was one of the worst high MPG players in the league for the first half of the season. LaMelo Ball was actually good.
"&gt;Should have traded the 2nd pick and drafted LaMelo and Haliburton.  Ball went pick 3, and Charlotte didn't have a second first round pick. How were you expecting them to achieve this?"
LaMelo Ball... SUCKS Terry Rozier... SUCKS Gordon Hayward... SUCKS
"Shai and MPJ are far from the worst lol  Probably Anthony Edwards or Lamelo Ball if we can just use rookies, but that‚Äôs kind of unfair lol.  Maybe like KPJ?"
"You know what, I have a another suggestion for you.    Anthony Edwards and LaMelo Ball are 2 rookies that are sure thing future all stars.   Watch their highlights and then watch how they grow next year.   I think that‚Äôs actually going to help you learn the game, seeing them make big improvements.  Maybe one of them regresses as the league adjusts to how they defend them.  That kind of thing happens to young players and teaches you a lot."
"You were putting words in my mouth claiming thought ball averaging 2 more assists was the reason I thought lamelo was more of a culture changer   I think ant has a lot to do with the wolves Success lately but he is not the sole catalyst or it would‚Äôve been happening regardless or not KAT DLO and everyone is Healthy along with the coach change can help too but having a facilitator like DLO and a center like KAT frees up the offense and ant takes pressure of them and makes them a much more dangerous team,   Ant is a great scorer and an extremely useful tool in the arsenal of any nba team but a culture changer is something different that impacts the whole team look at like Boston Tatum and brown and great iso scorers but they have struggled with identity and culture all year   I think Channing Frye illustrated it best here   https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1390086240813293568"
"Kobe did not build the culture and style of play in LA, that was Phil Jackson with the triangle, pat Riley Shaq lebron had a lot to do with the culture of the heat, culture changers are rare that‚Äôs my point ant is a rarely gifted athlete and scorer but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make them a culture changer, your mistaking being the best player as opposed to being to catalyst for established a culture as a team   I never said lamelo was a culture changer because of an assist number but the way he plays making the extra pass it‚Äôs extremely infectious and it has helped turned the hornets culture into one that is all about ball movement and quick decisions   I am purely talking about the way they effect the style of play which is the culture of the team the hornets simply play different when lamelo is in they average 3 more fast Break points a game when he plays, and there are quotes that everything starts with lamelo why we play as happy as the hornets do and share the ball  from people who have been on the hornets for years I never claimed this was. A stat thing quite the contrary i stated that ones style of play effects the way the whole team plays and did establish a culture   And one thing to notice about your first two points that Kobe‚Äôs and Wade‚Äôs culture there‚Äôs an outlier there you aren‚Äôt considering to as Shaq was on both  One last thing the wolves started winning when they got KAT and DLo back so it‚Äôs more reasonable to argue they are the culture changers   Link for Malik monk on lamelo culture comments   https://youtu.be/AoCc-pht3O0"
well... this proves it.  malachi flynn &gt; lamelo ball
Oversized ball-handler. Poor shooter and unathletic but leads the NBL (a professional league of grown men!) in assists at just 18 years old. Best comp would be Ben Simmons or LaMelo Ball.
"I think we‚Äôll be fine. Hayward is a great passer. Miles Bridges flashed some pretty good playmaking skills last season. Plumlee has always been a pretty good secondary ball mover. Bouknight should at least be able to create for himself. We‚Äôre also rumored to want re-sign Riller to a minimum contract.   Worst comes to worst, we just run like crazy in transition. LaMelo, Bridges, Lonzo, Bouknight, Rozier, and Kai should all be killer in transition."
"The Thunder just drafted an Australian in Josh Giddey if that interests you. Hornets have LaMelo Ball who played over there, and they're an exciting going team."
I don't see why Monk cant become that shooter on a team with Lamelo throwing him the ball.
"I also was a Lonzo doubter, but now he's my PG and LaMelo is making amazing plays.  Worshipping my Ball altar every day to see LiAngelo in NBA now."
I think he's definitely better than LaMelo Ball

"What future? They didn‚Äôt draft LaMelo Ball or Anthony Edwards. Wiseman was historically bad his rookie season, the chances of him developing into a top 10 player are slim to none.  If you have a top 5 player you always go all in. It‚Äôs possible to trade for useful vets instead of surrounding Curry with 18 year olds, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a superstar."
"Ain't no definitely. LaMelo and Ant are close enough that there would be a discussion in the FO. Based on fit I would lean Ball, but it's close."
"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
"I prefer Zion to Lamelo, but what exactly do you mean by PF/SF positional value? Zion is 6'5"", struggles to defend wings and protect the rim, and is not much of a shooter. I always saw Zion as a positionless superstar that will hopefully grow into a versatile defender. In a vaccum, I'd say a 6'6 playmaking PG is more valuable than a small-ball 5. Obviously, I'd still roll with Zion. He is that good."
I feel like this is close but only because Lamelo PROJECTS to be an elite playmaker &amp; he‚Äôs a ball handler. But Zion is probably the choice because he‚Äôs just a lot better rn
Remember when ESPN put Tatum #5 in their top 25 under 25? They put him below LaMelo Ball and Donovan Mitchell lmao
"7.5 and 6.8 is barely a difference, also Giddey played slightly more minutes. I have watched tape of Giddey and it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs a very skilled passer and gifted playmaker.    I still give the slight edge to LaMelo in terms of passing skill, but they‚Äôre both capable of delivering some amazing passes. It‚Äôs speed, quickness, and change of direction that gives LaMelo the higher ceiling as a playmaker. Also LaMelo is more of a scoring threat with a variety of crafty finishes and he‚Äôs a better shooter, though both can improve.    You‚Äôre right Giddey has an advantage in size and strength which will help him. This also makes him more versatile and let‚Äôs him play on the wind. He‚Äôs paired with SGA so he doesn‚Äôt have to be the primary ball handler anyway. I think he‚Äôs going to be a great NBA player and I‚Äôm looking forward to watching him."
"In terms of his role, no, he's really not.  He is a 6'8 point guard whose primary strengths lie in his ability to run the pick and roll and his playmaking and vision.    There is a chance he will play more of an off-ball role in the NBA, but it would be a complete misuse of his skillset and that is not why he is being drafted.  He is a PG.  Whose best skill is passing and creating in the pick and roll.  His biggest weakness is his shooting ability.  I'm sorry dude, please back up your point.  You can't just say ""he's closer to Ingles than Lamelo"" when I have spelled out clearly why that isn't the case..."

"Ingles is not a good comparison...they don't even play the same position and have very, very different skillsets.  I feel like literally the only reason anyone would think to compare them is because they are both white australians.  Also I haven't seen anyone compare him to Ingles.  That is a terrible comparison.  He's a tall, rangey point guard who was considered perhaps the best passer in the draft who struggles with his outside shooting.  There is zero basketball reason to compare him to Ingles.   I think Lamelo Ball, a much taller Rubio, etc. are much better comparisons.  Actually point guards who are very skilled passers but have question marks around their scoring ability."
I mean he‚Äôs also Australian so a much smoother transition then it would have been for Lamelo Ball
The Josh Giddey pick looks a lot like i want a Lamelo ball on my team pick
"Nets formed a super team with KD, Kyrie, Harden. Lakers are trying to run it back with their own Lebron, AD, Russ. Giannis got a chip in Milwaukee. Hawks, Knicks, Suns are back on the map with great potential. Hornets seem promising with Lamelo Ball. New stars in Tatum, Brown, Booker, Lavine, Trae, Doncic, Mitchell emerged and have already had decent playoff runs (except Lavine - Bulls are still average to mediocre team sadly). OKC, Houston, Magic all blew up their rosters lol. The process in Philli failed cause Simmons is worse than ppl thought. Jokic won MVP as a the first second round pick to do so."
LaMelo Ball could always repeat - https://youtu.be/rhf7kO0V6aQ
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
"The problem is ""combo guard"" is sometimes used as a pejorative (you'd want a bigger wing, you'd want a more reliable point guard), but if it semantically means just ""good primary handler, gives up no ground to wings,"" it's a clear compliment.   &gt;We‚Äôre seeing more taller ball handlers than ever (I‚Äôm aware of Magic‚Äôs existence) in players like Ben Simmons, LaMelo, giddy, even players like Julius randle, Kd, and LeBron all handle much more than forward and wings of the past.  NBA teams should see the utility in replacing their defensive liability point guards with guys who don't give up ground to power forwards, because that's obvious utility.   The question is whether anything fundamentally has changed about basketball (do 6'0"" guys no longer have a significant advantage when handling the ball?) or if taller human beings are just getting better at basketball."
"To me that is that modern SG. Being able to take the ball up court and set up players with passes along with the scoring and shooting you‚Äôd expect from a sg. In the NBA, all players in all positions have become more versatile than ever in their skill sets such as shooting and ball handling. We‚Äôre seeing more taller ball handlers than ever (I‚Äôm aware of Magic‚Äôs existence) in players like Ben Simmons, LaMelo, giddy, even players like Julius randle, Kd, and LeBron all handle much more than forward and wings of the past."
I agree with that completely. I had not heard this information though so thats brand new to me! Im intrigued. Id take Lonzo too ngl if the ball family not pleased but then again they stacking around LaMelo already
Imagine if you took Lamelo Ball and Jeremy Lin but a much worse athlete than both‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs Jason Preston.
"If you're honestly confusing LaMelo Ball and Carmelo Anthony, that's a you problem lmao"
"Anything is Possible!!!!! - LaMelo ""Paul Pierce"" Ball"
"Anything is Possible!!!!! - LaMelo ""Paul Pierce"" Ball"
"Guy is already a fantastic playmaker and fits in well with the current OKC team. He's really good at looking for passes the second he gets the ball and uses his vision super well. I also just really guys who've played professionally by the time they're 18/19 and tbh the NBL is a tough league to do well in. Giddey put up Lamelo like stats in the NBL; jumper has room to improve but it's hard to fault his scoring when you're 17/18 and playing in a league of professionals.   Overall, I think he's a fantastic fit in OKC and has a lot of upside as a playmaker in the NBA and will absolutely be better than Bouknight, who's easily the most overrated prospect in the entire draft"
He reminds him of lamelo ball? These guys are fucking weird
"No, no, this actually makes me feel better about our depth.  We played Bizmack Biyombo, the worst center in the league according to 538‚Äôs Raptor, 20 minutes per game last year. And we started him for 36 games because Co‚ÄùDay-to-Day‚Äù Zeller was injured for half of the season.  At least Plumlee won‚Äôt fumble a perfectly placed LaMelo Ball lob. If it‚Äôs what he becomes, he is the best backup center we‚Äôve had in years."
"LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges, Mason Plumlee.   Jason Preston, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, PJ Washington, Kai Jones."
I have an aneurysm every time people call lamelo ball melo
"LaMelo Ball - absentminded theme park employee ""lololo... wait, is that not what you ordered?"""
LaMelo Ball is a future all-star.
"Honestly this would be terrible for lamelo, they need him stepping into a ball dominate role next year. I could see getting big bro on the team leading to him being a little passive. Although it would be cool to see brothers play together."
"Going by team order.  I could see Toronto taking Suggs, Edwards, or Lamelo. I just think he might more likely take Suggs for great production as well as winning.  Orlando probably goes Edwards since they have a young C and PG on roster. But Lamelo is certainly plausible to go there.  That leaves OKC wanting to pair SGA with Wiseman or Ball. They certainly could take Wiseman but it‚Äôs not a given for that roster. Neither were clear cut over the other. Just feel like they would want to go the route many teams are going now with multiple guards. Plus they took Harden despite having Durant and Westbrook."
"Well the Hornets' best scorers may have been Terry Rozier, LaMelo Ball, and Devonte' Graham, who are all known as PGs mostly. So if you take out 1 PG and add a SG, your balance may be a little better.  (Rozier and Ball can basically be SGs, but Graham is pretty small.)"
"Most of the answers in this thread are multi-time ALL NBA players who likely would already be in the top 15 likeliest players to win MVP coming into the year. (PG13, Embiid, etc)  Guys like Trae, Tatum, Booker, Lavine, Beal, etc are all good answers as they have proven to be elite players, but they arent too exciting as ""dark horse"" candidates.  I think guys like LaMelo Ball who are in that next tier down (at least coming into the year) are more fun to take a guess at.   If i was spitballing some ideas of high quality players that could thrive with experience or with a new team situation that make for good 'dark horse' options:   **LaMelo Ball**   - CHA could finish a top 4 seed in theory. LaMelo is a great talent and likely has voters attention off of RoY campaign  **Pascal Siakam**   - could be the leader of a team that makes solid playoff spot. Good mix of counting stats   **Brandon Ingram**   - if hes in the mix its likely because of Zion being an MVP himself, but if they elevate NOP to a high seed and BI elevates his game he could be worth keeping an eye on  **Ja Morant**/**Jaren Jackson**   - Memphis has been an exciting team and can fight for higher seed. Both players are great young talents. JJJ could sneak in if he has great block numbers to go with his scoring"
From left field: LaMelo Ball or Michael Porter Jr
I‚Äôm down. My resume is backup PG to Lamelo Ball at Chino Hills High and that one dude who throws lobs up to Onyeka.
"Lamelo ball, a fame fan"
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
"&gt; It actually is true. Show me a made it to the ECF trophy. Oh wait there isn't one. Only winning the conference and winning the finals. And because of this no Atlanta didn't have any better of a season because they didn't get any awards for their season  And you were saying I was semantics? Holy cripes. You're right though, Sacramento and Portland definitely had equal seasons this year.   &gt;Golden state between 2013 and 2020 has been the worst drafting teams in the league. They drafted Wiseman when Lamelo was clearly number 1 by the best scouts, and drafted complete bust like McCaw Jacob Evans and Damian Jones  You're correct, they're draft record hasn't been top notch the past few years. But when you're constantly drafting 25th or lower, that'll happen. McCaw was fine for where he was drafted, Looney was great at 25, Paschall was really good at 41, and Poole is looking as well. Funny how you left those guys out. As for Wiseman, give them a few years before touting that one. Even if Ball ends up being the better player (which is likely) give Wiseman some time to develop. He showed a lot of promise last year despite barely playing college, having no summer league, having no pre-season, and dealing with injuries. Wiseman will be fine.  &gt;The one team that did it was Philly and it worked, and the one team that is trying it is widely considered the smartest front office in the league.  It worked? But by your own words, if you don't win your conference then you didn't accomplish anything. So what exactly worked?  As for OKC, they were touted as being successful in part due to all the assets they acquired and still being a competitive team. As soon they start pulling garbage trades like trading SGA, they won't be looked at in the same way."
Trae Young / LaMelo Ball / Tyrese Haliburton  Luka Doncic / Lu Dort / Desmond Bane  Michael Porter Jr / DeAndre Hunter / Duncan Robinson  Jaren Jackson Jr / John Collins / PJ Tucker  DeAndre Ayton / Xavier Tillman / Isaiah Stewart
LeBron was called 'The Chosen One' on magazine covers and was picked first overall. LaMelo is a Ball brother that was picked 3rd overall
"Yes. His name is Terry Rozier.  Lonzo isn't going to replace that scoring or dog mentality, and Terry has also been improving steadily ever since he first got to Charlotte. Hes still young as well, and has been significantly more durable than Lonzo as well.  Lets say we're afraid of him wanting a big salary: well, give him this year to prove it. If he balls out, excellent, we probably played well and we'll have his Bird Rights anyways. If he doesnt, also excellent, because now we can get him at a discount, or even trade him then.   To me, it makes more sense to try to trade Terry at the deadline anyways *if* you were to move him  We have LaMelo, a legit PG. You say we need a secondary ball handler? Terry does that. We need stalwart defense? Terry does that. We need someone who can shoot 3s? Terry does that.   The only thing Lonzo does better than Terry, IMO, is rack up assists. And while that's all well and good, we already had one of the slower and more vapid offenses in the league, and losing a scorer like Terry isn't going to help that."
In b4 lamelo ball carries US to victory because Curry lebron are old and the new age goats like Giannis are Luka playing for their own countries teams.
"Last year was the Lamelo Ball hype. There were reports Timberwolves were considering Ball 1st overall. To be fair the top 3 last year was a lot murkier, but yeah this happens every year. Besides Zion and Lebron, there‚Äôs always reports that a team is thinking of doing something crazy, and then it doesn‚Äôt happen."
"I mean what else were they gonna do? Draft Jahlil Okafor?  Same with the Edwards pick, they already had D'Angelo Russell, they were not gonna take Lamelo Ball.  Josh Okogie was a decent find at 20th though"
"&gt; Led by Luka Doncic, who won the MVP awards in 2023 and 2025, and co-star Karl-Anthony Towns, the Mavericks won the 2024 and 2025 championships over the Nets and Hawks, respectively. Doncic, now considered the best player in the world by a wide majority of pundits, averages 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists in an entertaining MVP race with Hornets superstar LaMelo Ball. The Mavericks look to secure the first threepeat since the 2000-2002 Lakers.  I'll take it."
I‚Äôm shocked Zion wasn‚Äôt called up + LaMelo Ball over Johnson.
"I think the future are oversized primary ball handlers who combine playmaking and scoring. Harden is obviously the first to come to mind but now we have Luka, LaMelo and Cade. Now in order to cross into GOAT territory they‚Äôd need to combine that awesome offensive package with freakish athleticism and all-defense capabilities. Cade‚Äôs got an outside shot, and although I think he‚Äôll be amazing, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs quite that guy athletically.   I think the likelihood of a 7-footer ever existing with Giannis‚Äô motor and tenacity as well as having all-time great shooting skill like KD is extremely low. When someone is that big and athletic they‚Äôre just not taught the prerequisite skills a lot of the time.   But as kids are developing more and more well rounded games, I can definitely see someone who is 6-foot-8, highly athletic and has that rare savant quality to their games.   I know this sounds like LeBron, but picture this player with a career 38% 3 point shooting on high volume and more of a graceful wiry athlete like an oversized Ja Morant rather than a freight train like LeBron. Would help if they had all-time longevity too."
This is just such a bad take.   So you stuff up your pick by going after a big because you need one when you could of taken lamelo. (imagine warriors next season trading lamelo for players to help Curry and Klay. It would probably guarantee a finals appearance) anyways that doesnt matter because your office is moronic they took a big who hasnt played college ball and threw him into the nba where he solo lost games over and over with his terrible defence and bang average offense.  If he was a late lottery pick he is doing fantastically. In 3-5 i also believe he will be a good player but warriors timeline is over by then. Curry Klay and dray are done. They arnt carrying teams anymore and that leaves the warriors with no good picks because they will still seed highly.  Unless they can get a good big for two picks then they wont have anyone to help them get over the line.
LaMelo didn't stand out at all the first two months. Not gonna lie I cringe everytime I see 'unselfishness' and 'willingness to pass'. These are not traits you were never going to see in a point guard who isn't an elite shot creator. Yeah no shit Draymond is a willing passer when he can't do shit on offense besides set screens and steal assists from Curry attracting doubles.   Melo on the Warriors would have been on the bench and be a complete non-bo with Draymond who handles the ball 80% of the time. When he doesn't teams sag off of him and he needs the ball by design due to his deficiency. Assists are also a lot harder to get when you're playing with a crappy 2nd unit
"Ball only played 12 games more than him, and only started 4 games more than Wiseman...when he got the starting job 2 months in while Wiseman lost his starting spot after a month.   [The damn team themselves thought Ball was supposed to go #2](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/09/warriors-nba-draft-promise-lamelo-ball/)  Instead they drafted a #2 lmao because they were scared LaMelo was gonna end up like his brother and went with the safer pick because Wiseman went to college while people were clowning the talent in the NBL...which coincidentally helped beat the USA team recently.   It's ok to make a mistake every now and then bro, your drafting record has been good after Todd Fuller. It's obvious the Dubs gambled on the safer pick and lost."
"I think they would, Lonzo is a great passer but a bad shot creator in the half court, playing off a better playmaker like LaMelo would benefit him a lot I think.  Plus he's a big guard that can defend and rebound.  The playmaking with the Ball bros and Hayward on the court would be a joy to watch."
Lamelo ain‚Äôt playing summer ball lol
"Lonzo Ball, LiAngelo Ball, Lamelo Ball"
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
Honestly how lamelo is doing is kinda making me think Gelo probably is really good. He shoots the ball the best out of all of them.
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De‚ÄôAaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De‚ÄôAaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he‚Äôs on a team that hasn‚Äôt made the playoffs since 2006 and isn‚Äôt exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He‚Äôs not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you‚Äôre the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn‚Äôt going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven‚Äôt made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn‚Äôt have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn‚Äôt go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am completely off the ‚ÄúBen Simmons has superstar potential‚Äù bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It‚Äôs been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he‚Äôs going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it‚Äôs not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He‚Äôs their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He‚Äôs a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton‚Äôs contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6‚Äô1‚Äù shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it‚Äôs not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks‚Äô title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that he wasn‚Äôt the most deserving candidate. He‚Äôs a great player don‚Äôt get me wrong but it‚Äôs a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can‚Äôt help but wonder if that Jazz would‚Äôve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he‚Äôs consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I‚Äôd believe DeRozan‚Äôs role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he‚Äôs still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he‚Äôd be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn‚Äôt able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He‚Äôs going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he‚Äôs still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn‚Äôt play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year‚Äôs draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga‚Äôs Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we‚Äôre already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"**Players better than him:** Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, KD, Curry, CP3, Booker, Mitchell, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Harden, Trae, PG13, AD, (healthy) Kyrie, Beal, Butler, Embiid, Tatum, Westbrook, KAT     **Players he is better than:** Jamal, Blake, Lowry, Porzingis, Tobias, Draymond, Collins, Van Vleet, Brooks, Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Wall, Oladipo, Sabonis, Vucevic, Shai, Lamelo Ball, etc. etc.     **Players he is more or less on the same level with:** Jaylen Brown, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Pascal Siakam, Deangelo Russell, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan"
Our biggest issue was lack of ball handlers and intiators. We also struggled since most of put players didn't make quick reads so ball movement wasn't great.   LaMelo would've fixed a lot of those issues &amp; allowed us to play Steph off ball a lot more.
Why not?  The Warriors was a 1 man show last season without Klay. He would've helped take the pressure off Curry with the ball handling for sure. Curry could run more off screens while LaMelo set him up for open looks. I think it would have been a dope fit.
Lamelo ball
Role player who won 5 all stars was all nba all defense and a 3 time champion yea that‚Äôs greater than someone who has made all league a couple times and has 0 rings. Will luka be better all time when it‚Äôs all said and done yes obviously but you gotta make people earn it. Is Zion Williamson higher on your all time list than John Stockton Carmelo Reggie Miller. Apparently in your mind Lamelo ball has had a more successful nba career than a player like Jason Williams who won a ring and was a very good starting PG for years like how could you have a guy who played 41 games be higher than another who played 13 seasons in the league just cause in Lamelos peak he looked better. Will Lamelo end up being better than Jason Williams of course but he has to earn it first and play some years have some common sense manüòÇüòÇüòÇ
LaMelo Ball - Ben Savage
"There‚Äôs quite a few instances of the ‚Äúthe younger brother is actually the best!‚Äù Thing being true. Nick Bosa for instance was said to just be a more athletic version of Joey Bosa, and that proved true. Or with the Ball Brothers, people have been hyping up Lamelo as the best of the bunch for a long time, and so far it looks that way.  But yeah there‚Äôs also a lot of times where it‚Äôs bullshit. With the Antetokounpos, I‚Äôm gonna choose to believe it‚Äôs bullshit because if Giannis isn‚Äôt even the best player in his family then the league is actually fucked."
bro what? The only one who can create their own shot on the ball side is lamelo.
I know he called out LaMelo Ball in 2016/2017 on Bill Simmons podcast saying that he will be a special player in the league in a few years
Luka is a ball dominant PNR guard though? Like Harden.  I'm saying Lamelo is more of a PnR guard with very high potential because of it and Lonzo is a 3 and D guard. Both are very valuable imo
Not sure about the fastest but Lou Williams and Lamelo Ball have pretty fast FT routines
Anthony Edwards actually wins but the media give the prize to Lamelo Ball
"Definitely a homer take but I believe our small ball lineup of Lamelo, Terry Rozier, Hayward, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington will be our most effective lineup offensively and defensively. I hope we choose to just close most games with that group because they all complement each other so well."
His off ball defense at times looked like the worst in the League. If he improved that he becomes a better prospect than Lamelo imo
Lamelo 2   Point guard. Elite vision. Good off ball and off the dribble shooter. Rising player who should improve  SGA 4  Elite 50/40/90 potential scorer. Also a rising talent. Able to run point and play off of the ball. SGA is elite today. Ceiling is very very high.  Mikal 2  Off ball shooting is elite. Major defensive weapon. He‚Äôll be the glue holding the defense together on the perimeter and as an off ball beast. Very high upside shooter. Improving offensive players   Zion 4  Y‚Äôall know about Zion. I have wings who can shoot and defend on the perimeter. And Ayton with zion is just monstrous in the post. Zion might shoot 80% on this squad  Ayton 3  Ayton will be the anchor. The kind of player zion needs at center. He‚Äôs improving every year and I‚Äôm excited to see him keep getting better
Lamelo Ball  Gary Trent Jr.  Anthony Edwards  Jayson Tatum  Nikola Jokic
"It's probably a myth but one could argue it holds some ground as well. I think the poster used the wrong term or context, but I do agree with his point on Anthony Edwards and Lamelo ball. MVP and rookie of the year aren't comparable though so my input may hold no merit. The league is always looking for the next big thing, it's subjective and every fan/fan base is going to  feel a certain type of way"
"In **South East** I'd change Suggs and Hayward for LaMelo and Isaac to have:  Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac, Bam Adebayo.   In **South West** I'd change Thad Young for Dejounte Murray straight up.  In terms of rankings, I'd go:  1. **Pacific** \- LeBron, Steph and Kawhi is just too much. Especially with a rim-running big man and a lights-out shooter.  2. **North West** \- When the worst player in your lineup is Shai and you have elite shooting throughout, that's scary. 3. **Atlantic** \- my one concern here is that unless FVV develops it, there isn't really an elite playmaker in this lineup.  4. **South East** \- Massive firepower in Trae, LaMelo and Beal, and then you bank on there being enough defense from Isaac and Bam to cover it. Isaac and Beal won't be taking a shot.  5. **Central** \- Lots of talent in the lineup but the lack of versaility made me put them so low. Their 3-5 can't really shoot from the perimeter. 6. **South West** \- Honestly, just the last talent?"
"No, it isn't.  Who do you think is more popular between Lamelo Ball and De'Aaron Fox? Who do you think is better?"
LaMelo. He'll get the ball to you.
"I really like Ben Simmons as a point-forward-center on the Hornets where he splits point guard duties with LaMelo, big man duties with PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, and Mason Plumlee and transforms our defense. I just don't think we have the assets to pull off a trade unless Philly is enamored with Hayward, and also we cratered our guard rotation and shooting from the bench unit in the offseason so the fit isn't as good as it would've been a few months ago.   Idk if he'd necessarily be the #1 option Rozier, Ball, or Hayward would likely take more shots, but any combo of 3 of them could easily be in the 17-20 ppg range."
"Ben IS the big. Realistically, he needs the land wide open to drive or he needs to be fed from the dunkers spot. He also needs to buy in to attacking the rim for all 4 quarters. Jokic would be helpful if you wanted him spacing and passing to Ben, but then you'd be wasting Jokic's scoring ability.   Ben could be wild as something like a small ball 5 with a snappy offense like Charlotte. It would require giving up control of the offense to LaMelo, but the speed of the offense would give him the most opportunities to score in transition. Jokic, Embiid, Kat aren't running sprints all game to accommodate Ben."
GSW  Damion Jones -&gt; Deyonta Davis  Jacob Evans -&gt; Dzanan Musa  Jordan Poole -&gt; Keldon Johnson   James Wiseman -&gt; Lamelo Ball    I guess better with ball and worse/no change with the others?
2016: Damian Jones becomes Deyonta Davis. This is a wash.  2017: Jordan Bell technically becomes Jawun Evans. This is probably a downgrade.  2018: Jacob Evans becomes Dzanan Musa. This is probably a wash  2019: Jordan Poole becomes Keldon Johnson. This is probably a downgrade.  2020: James Wiseman becomes Lamelo Ball. This is definitely an upgrade at this point in their respective careers.
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
"Allen wasn‚Äôt traded for a lotto pick, he was traded for second rounders. My point was to show that Memphis basically gave him away, so trades are clearly possible.  Ofc trades are possible, I can trade you my house for your sandwich! But are they worthwhile? Not with what was available.   &gt; Scottie was rated higher all around the league than Kuminga. The Warriors themselves were going to take him instead of Kuminga if Barnes was available. He‚Äôs projected much higher. Please do not act like you actually keep up with the league, this is evident considering you called Scottie a big. He‚Äôs a point forward/point guard actually. Kuminga went so low specifically because he is raw and I‚Äôm not even talking about summer league.  I didn‚Äôt call Barnes a wing I was talking about Wiseman and staring if you were impatient for him I feel for Barnes. Kuminga went 7 and Barnes went 4. That‚Äôs not so low. Prospect ranking wise Barnes was 5 and Kuminga is 6. Kuminga actually played in a much better league than Barnes and as we saw with Lamelo Ball, that helps your maturity a ton. But for now Barnes is NBA ready defensively and his passing is good but has no shooting as of now, Kuminga is more raw yes but has shown great flashes. He is not bone raw. Kinda like Anthony Edwards level raw.  Wiggins may have been better offensively but he wasn‚Äôt as efficient and the greatest shooter doesn‚Äôt make you a lockdown on-ball defender.  &gt; Warriors FO are wasting the tail end of Curry‚Äôs prime.  No. Trading your best assets for the next 3 years for a salary dump or a guy like Simmons who makes spacing much  worse on Curry instead of waiting for an actually good fit is wasting the end of his prime."
1. Cade Cunningham  2. Anthony Edwards 3. LaMelo Ball  4. Jalen Green  5. Evan Mobley  6. Jalen Suggs
"Lamelo Ball has an annoying immature personality and is overrated, both as a person and as a player. For one, he only played 51 games (58 if adjusted to 82 game schedule, which is still bad)."
"Agree with Green and Edwards, but the others idk about. Sure, LaMelo and Cade are both tall, but they don't play similarly. LaMelo has insane handles and separation, with his defense, efficiency, and shooting being the main concerns coming into the draft. Cade had strong shooting, scoring at all 3 levels, and defense, but below average shiftiness and handles for a lead guard. Wiseman and Mobley were also pretty different. Wiseman came in with top tier physicals and good skills with the ball, but poor defensive instincts. Mobley's strength was rim protection and overall defense, but his physical frame needs a lot of work."
dearoon fox will lead kings to playoffs this year  zion is a lazy guy who needs to play in a winning team to have impact  lonzo ball is the best ball player - lamelo sucks and is just flash
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
Lamelo 3 point shot is nowhere near good enough to pair with simmons and a center. Unless you played a lot of small ball simmons 5 other than i do not think lamelo and simmons could share the floor.  IF i am charlotte i am not taking that move
"LaMelo was actually surprisingly effective as an off-ball player last season, part of me worried coming into the season that he'd play uninterested if he wasn't running the show but there were plenty of times where we'd play him with Devonte/Rozier/Hayward all on the floor and he'd fit in pretty nicely as a wing. Knows his spots, moves well without the ball and knows where the ball needs to move, pretty good with catch-and-shoot opportunities, always hunting offensive rebounds.   But that being said I agree with your overall point. LaMelo works well in lineups with those guys (Rozier/Hayward) because once he's back to controlling the ball, they can play off of him. Like you said, Ben just doesn't have any value in that situation. And even when he does have the ball in his hands, he's not looking to get a bucket the way Rozier/Hayward are. Our offense moves the ball fine, we need more guys comfortable putting the ball in the hoop."
"&gt; Simmons and Lamelo is an awful pairing. Both too ball dominant.  Thats assuming Ben knows what to do with the ball when it is in his hands.   *in that 2018 series vs the Celtics, he was looking to pass while he had 15 feet to the closest defender who wasn't even looking to close the gap but rather was defending the paint*"
Simmons and Lamelo is an awful pairing. Both too ball dominant.
"I don‚Äôt think that necessarily true, but you‚Äôre also mixing up LaMelo‚Äôs usage. LaMelo for the Hornets is a connector not a lead guard. Usually he maximizes situations with his passing when someone gets him in an advantage situation. But besides that, I don‚Äôt think Simmons is limited off ball. Isn‚Äôt everyone suggesting he play PF? Putting him as a play finisher / screener would probably help him alot in half court offense, and he can run the break in transition. I don‚Äôt think this is too much of a big deal because LaMelo is good off ball. Think he shot 40% on C&amp;S threes before his wrist injury"
Like the delay of game on Lamelo cause the ball hit the top on his head otw down from the basket tf??

"You know Lamelo wouldn‚Äôt just come in on the Warriors and be as good right? He‚Äôd have to play a whole different game as he‚Äôd primarily be an off-ball distributor and shooter. He is the PG of his offense where in GS it‚Äôd be Dray, Curry, then Ball. Not to mention how he‚Äôd get benched for defense. While he‚Äôd be better than Wiseman was since he‚Äôs a guard he‚Äôd be nowhere near ROY or All-star level. And for your timeline it makes no sense to draft a raw(which is what the entire top 3 was) PG with flashy passing but bad shooting and defense when you have Steph and Klay always playing over him. He‚Äôd never get starter level minutes (26+) until year 4 of his career at best."
Melo walked across after Lamelo had already been given the ball. Definite tech and started the whole thing.
Keep it together but it was so fucking obvious the refs decided they were gonna call a foul when lamelo went up. When have we ever seen a player pass the ball right there and get a call.
"why do the hornets keep forgetting how to play basketball in the 4th quarter  all game long good stuff, good stuff, ball motion, lamelo doin lamelo stuff  then in the 4th quarter they all freeze up"
"Lamelo Ball hearing the ""MELO"" chants in Staples Center: http://imgur.com/a/lTk7Ccb"
"Unrelated fun stat I just noticed during the game:  Tyler Herro averages more FGA per game than LaMelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, Karl-Anthony Towns, Fred VanVleet, Jordan Clarkson, Joel Embiid, and James Harden."
I‚Äôm watching Lakers game rn and the commentators are like ‚Äúlamelo ball is blowing past elite defender Avery bradley‚Äù I‚Äôm like he‚Äôs not elite anymore üòÇ
Lamelo Ball. They Thought He Was Ova When He Dropped Out.
"1) Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, Cole Anthony.  2) Luka Donnakick, trae young, Zion Williamson( assuming he‚Äôs the 27 ppg 60% fg beast he was last season) and ja morant."
"You yourself should look up the rule changes. I have. They are vague but they give some video examples of what they're trying to remove... and then you can interpret from there. The plays they show are not all encompassing but they get the point across. One of them is the old pump fake then jump into a defender. Another is stopping in front of someone running behind you. Another is kicking your leg out on a shot. The one that applies here is referred to as creating contact with your off hand. In their video example it's Trey Young vs LaMelo Ball. Not exactly the same as here but similar enough to apply it. Trey is dribbling with left hand and goes to gather through LaMelo's outstretched arm. The off hand comes up underneath and the ball hand comes together and then you have a similar botched shot attempt. It was a foul last year and it's specifically NOT one this year. Again, if you watch the Trey Young video the league showed you can interpret what that means but TO ME it's easy to see that this is the basis for why the original video will not be considered a foul this year.   That's why I said had he taken the contact differently it would have been a foul. Oh and grow up with your read the rulebook shit lmao. Are you also the guy that gets confused about travel calls because you count the gather?"
I could see San Antonio going for Sexton.  Dejounte is 6'4 and has an all-defense accolade to his name. You could have him defend opposing 2-guards and you give Sexton the bigger ball-handler he needs to be paired with. We're already seeing a similar thing with Terry Rozier and LaMelo.

He also takes stupid shots in big moments because he wants to be that guy so badly.. Hero ball cost the hornets that game vs boston because Lamelo took two bad threes trying to be a hero.
You rarely see players catch the ball and react to a defender approaching them in a urgent manner... in that Hornets game Lamelo has no interest in initiating a dribble on him.  That was one an eye opening moment to me.
"What is Miles Bridges player comparison now?   He‚Äôs just a versatile 3-4, maybe can play 5 small ball..  I heard some Shawn Marion comp between motor, athleticism and iq and overall versatility  Such a great fit with Lamelo"
"It‚Äôs the 10th game of the regular season bro, relax. I could see your concern if we were half war through the season or if Green hadn‚Äôt shown any flashes yet, but he‚Äôs had games where he‚Äôs dropped 30 and 26 within these 10 games. Just give him time, LaMelo Ball and Anthony Edwards we‚Äôre looking bad early last season and look at them now"
LaMelo Ball
"1) Did you miss the part of my comment that said I'd take him for the current season?   2) if I was trying to win the next 10games, I'd also take LaMelo, unless my team already has 3 ball dominant guys. At which point it would be close, but I'd still probably take LaMelo.   Again, role player and efficient #1 option playmaker are world apart in value. It's always hilarious when redditors go ahead calling other fans ""box score watchers"" because they want to sound smart. I'm sure you used to think Jae Crowder was a better player than DeMar. What a joke."
"Switch Westbrick with Jrue Holiday on the wizards last year and they would have made the second round at least.   Jrue, Trae, dame, unvaccinated Kyrie, Schroeder, D Fox, injured Klay, CP3, Elfrid Payton, Kyle Lowry, lonzo ball, lamelo ball, even Ben simmons are each &gt; Westbrick"
Probably those older brother instincts at play. As the oldest of 3 I bet he's dodged some similar moves from Lamelo and Liangelo when they were playing ball growing up.
"Ok, but lonzo is more athletic than Lamelo, so that should help him. Also lonzos ball handling is better than people give him credit for, he‚Äôs just doesn‚Äôt have the confidence to show it. Look at his crossovers from high school and look how good his ball handling is."
"Can you show me where I said that AAVE and intelligence are mutually exclusive? You‚Äôre making shit up. I said that LaMelo doesn‚Äôt have intelligent commentary in him and you mentioned AAVE.   You think that a national broadcast sundowner would be receptive to AAVE, on what basis do you purport to make this claim?  I don‚Äôt think LaMelo is smart. From what I have heard him say and the manner in which he speaks. And I sure as hell don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd make a good broadcaster. Your delusional if you think LaMelo fucking ball would be a good broadcaster. Guys like Tony Romo and Alvin Williams make good athletes turn broadcasters. I.e guys that are well spoken and articulate. Not the fucking ball brothers"
Yes. My point is you could have had Poole AND Lamelo Ball whose potential is even higher.

"Hornets put all their points into offense when they re-spec'd in the offseason. If what our announcers were saying during the game is true they're the first place offense and last place defense lol.  Lamelo is legit tho and looking like he definitely deserved that ROTY. Even though I was pulling for Hali, hard to be mad after seeing what Ball is doing this year"
 So much for a [top 10 focus](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/fast-but-not-loose-james-borrego-has-lamelo-ball-and-the-hornets-flying-out-of-the-gate/amp/#:~:text=%22That%27s%20been%20our%20No.%201%20priority%2C%22%20Borrego%20said.%20%22Top-10%20defense%20this%20year.%20That%27s%20where%20it%20starts.%22)
Surprising that LaMelo Ball is 3rd on the deflections list. Damn that boy good
"I'm not really sure what part of his skillset is all star level. He's got potential to be a really good 3&amp;D player, but I dont see how that player is an all star wing/guard in a conference with Tatum, Brown, Lamelo, Lavine, etc. Those guys are absolutely elite at multiple things, even at young ages, where does GTJ even compare? He's not an elite ball handler, play maker, or scorer. He's a good but not DPOY level defender (which is the only way you make the all star game as a defensive player).   I mean you always have those once a lifetime selections like Dlo that luck their way in, but Dlo is not an all star level player and neither is GTJ. Not even close. Scottie and OG look far more likely to make an all star team, probably even a few, the raps should still have plenty to be happy about."
"clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game      ball is inbounded to Lamelo who turns face to face against Fox      ""You took my family""      moves to the left      ""You took my friends""      moves to the right      ""You took all that was dear to me""      clock winds down to 2      ""I cant get them back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR MY FRIENDS""      goes up, fire coming out of his shoes      ""LAMELORUKEN""      Ball flies over Fox's head, goes straight into basket. Lamelo falls to the ground, exhausted.      ""Senpai... I...""      faints      Final Score      Kings 140      Hornets 110"
"Aight man. The Kings are finally looking solid and exciting, win by 30 points, and the only post on r/NBA about the game is about Lamelo Ball lmao"
"Giannis seems like a good dude and he's fun to watch. I want a Warrior, one of the Bulls, or LaMelo Ball but I'd be cool with Giannis winning."
don't ever lose that sense of humor. Could you see LaMelo Ball being a dark horse for MVP?
"See that‚Äôs exactly what I mean. Read what I said about turn overs again. I said our ball movment wasn‚Äôt up to par even though our turnovers wherent crazy.  I barely spoke about turn overs, my main complaints was the unforced errors,  terry being cold all season and lamelo being steph at home and DJ Augustine at away all consistent trends 9 games in. That you guys wanted credit for when hornets fans said we didn‚Äôt play a good game.    I don‚Äôt hate anyone, I think you guys just need to get over yourselves and not try to argue what‚Äôs wrong with a team to that teams fan base."
"Not really to me.  Of the two Hornets games I have watched, LaMelo has a tendency to aggressively go for the players after he turns the ball over or if he thinks he gets fouled but gets no whistle.  He also plays physical, close up defence on the perimeter; he gets away with a lot of blatant shoves and pushes, but refs are bound to call some, if not most of them."
"He's a rookie who hasn't played in months.  He doesn't look lost out there and he's taking good shots. They'll fall eventually. Hopefully.  I would start worrying if he stops shooting. But as long as he's able to get to spots he likes and is willing to pull it, he'll figure it out. This year or next.  I've been a little disappointed in his playmaking, though. I haven't watched every play of every game but I haven't seen him make the kind of passes that unlock a defense. Mostly just standard ball movement, game management type stuff. I was expecting the kind of passes that Lamelo or Ja were making right out of the gate‚Öï"

"Assuming a help heavy defense. The instant Draymond drives, someone needed to bump Kevon to try dissuade the roll. Then hurry over to cover the corner.  Who should be the one bumping depends on defensive schemes and allocation of stamina between offensive/defensive players.  In a perfect world Gordon could been a savant and bumped Kevon with ample time to get back to Andrew. 2nd perfect world would have LaMelo bumping. But then we're getting into allocation of stamina debates.  Overall, a solid set by GSW that caught Hornets offguard. Realistically, only way to stop this play is for Miles to anticipate the pass and deflect the ball."
"Yeah, but Rozier has,always been a ball dominant guard. He was never going to be a good fit for Lamelo."
Are you guys so up you‚Äôre own asses that you‚Äôre gonna tell another team what‚Äôs wrong with them ? Yes the warriors defense is good. But from someone who‚Äôs watched every game that wasn‚Äôt their best game. Kelly played his worst game for the hornets terry has yet to find his rhythm this season. Was our worst game from a ball movement perspective we didn‚Äôt even average a lot of turnovers for us. As a team they rolled over in the 4th which hasn‚Äôt been their MO this season.   Obviously lamelo couldn‚Äôt hunt match ups (granted I feel like we should of tried to get steph on bridges and Gordon more) primary due to y‚Äôall‚Äôs defense. And mason existing forced us to play small ball which plays in yall hands.   We played 3 in 4 with cross country so I‚Äôm gonna assume this has something to do with the internal reasons we where off.

"This roster has some of the most confusing roster construction of perhaps any team in the league and it's really starting to cost us games. We decided to completely forgo the offseason by trading for Mason Plumlee and the results have been disastrous. Of course we are trying to pivot to almost full-time small ball but our highest paid players in Hayward and Rozier are both basically the opposite of the type of player you want next to Lamelo - ball stoppers, can't drive past anybody, not particularly good passers. Basically the only thing holding this team together is Miles being consistently nuclear to start the season.  I would go into the bench but let me just say Oubre and Ish Smith are not the type of players who should be the primary options against the staggered stars that basically every other team puts out against our 5 bench lineup. We should've just kept Monk because Kelly is just fucking terrible except the occasional game where he drops 5 threes"
Is Jordan Poole better than LaMelo Ball?

If the NBA wisely decides to clamp down on the plague of ""take fouls"" that halt fast breaks, it could just call it the LaMelo Ball Rule.  Asked how many possessions he'd like to play in transition in a 100-possession game, Ball responds, ""A hundred.""  ""It's fun being out there on the floor with him because he's not afraid,"" says Hornets forward¬†[Gordon Hayward](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward). ""If you cut and get open, he'll throw it to you. He's not afraid of that turnover. A lot of players hold back on those kinds of plays -- a baseball throw, an underhanded pass, threading the needle. He doesn't.""  Ball isn't defensive about anything -- it's simply not in his nature. But he's well aware of the question, one posed internally by a Hornets front office that nabbed him No. 3 overall, about his capacity to organize the brand of pick-and-roll offense that commands today's half-court game, especially in high-stakes situations.  ""I feel like you get that from just hooping,"" he says. ""You learn when to pick your spots -- knowing when to stay in the play, knowing when to break the play. You just play basketball. I feel confident coming off any ball screen. Any action like that? I'm solid.""  For the Hornets, Ball represents their best chance ever to have as the face of their franchise a high wattage talent who can truly change the fortunes of the organization -- a player who can maximize the potential of his teammates and draw national attention to what remains among the NBA's most anonymous franchises, and one of its most futile.  But this is the NBA's highest of high-wire acts. Everything that could go right with its prized new franchise cornerstone; Charlotte could get a full, healthy season from Hayward -- their multipurpose star free agent who came in with Ball during the past offseason; young contributors like Bridges and¬†[P.J. Washington](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278078/pj-washington)¬†could make jumps and add to production provided by¬†[Terry Rozier](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3074752/terry-rozier), who has been a revelation since arriving from¬†[Boston](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics)¬†a year before Hayward. Ish Smith could pace a fun second unit, and coach James Borrego could fully Spurs-ify the operation.  And yet, still, the experiment might fail.  ÔøºThrough the Hornets' first eight games, the 20-year-old Ball is averaging 20.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game -- and shooting a ridiculous 44% from 3.¬†Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports  THERE'S A CERTAIN¬†flavor of anticipation that imbues an organization a season or two into a rebuild if its armed with a player of Ball's caliber -- provided he's the real thing.  Ball's potential is the single most important variable in determining the Hornets' ceiling. Become an All-NBA point guard, and Charlotte should be a regular tour stop on the playoff circuit for years. But if he's merely very good, it will be difficult to break out of a suddenly crowded East, where in addition to the current powerhouses planted atop the standings, teams like¬†[Atlanta](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks),¬†[Detroit](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons)¬†and¬†[Orlando](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic)¬†all share the same belief that a young, dynamic high-lottery guard can elevate them to relevance.  What Ball has shown the Hornets from his first hours as a Hornet has inspired them. Borrego recalls the first night after the draft last November when Ball arrived in Charlotte. The team's brass took him and a group that included his trainer and agent to Morton's The Steakhouse. Ball pounded his steak, then looked up at the table and said, ""Let's get to a gym.""  ""It's almost 11 [p.m.], he's just hammered his steak and he wanted to get his work in,"" Borrego says. ""By the time he and his team get to the facility, it's almost midnight. The next day, we looked at the cameras from the gym -- he was there until about 2 [a.m.] He hasn't been in town for a day, and that's where his focus was. His care factor about his craft is off the charts.""  From the moment he slides their team cap onto his smiling head on draft night, that team has about seven years to persuade him to stay -- and every team faces a different degree of difficulty in making the sale, because some elite young stars are looking for any reason to stay, while others are looking for any reason to leave.

Some NBA point guards might extend a middle schooler their mercy, especially if the kid is the boss' son. But Ball doesn't temper his competitiveness. As he sizes up his teenage combatant, Ball delivers the trash with a smile.  A crossover to the hole elicits a shimmy from Ball, one returned when his teenage competitor drains a shot. Throughout the late afternoon, the shimmy fest escalates to levels of benevolent absurdity. Something that those who delight in amusement when they hear about the pro baller not pulling punches in the sweetest exhibitions against the most adoring minors can never understand: There's no such thing as¬†turning it off.  Once the afternoon Carolina heat thickened to a stew, LaMelo, his brother LiAngelo -- Gelo to everyone present that afternoon -- and a friend jumped into the Borregos' pool, where they continued hooping with the Borrego kids under rules modified for water.  On the surface, there's nothing odd about the scene -- a confident LaMelo and his brother playing backyard camp counselor. But Ball is a budding NBA superstar, one whose fame predates his arrival into the league. Drafted by a small market 2,000 miles away from hi"
Adding to the lists. Ja Morant how can you not have him on here. Also not included on the list are other Rookies from last year breaking out like LaMelo ball already avg 20/6/6. Also current year rookies looks amazing
"This game is a perfect reminder that the Warriors should have Lamelo Ball instead of James Wiseman. His shot form was too weird though, right reddit? And his efficiency too low. Glad I still listen to what reddit has to say though."
"Damn, lamelo carries or palms the ball like every third dribble"
"Just waiting for Lamelo to have a good game so even if the Warriors blow them out, every comment in the post-game thread will be about ‚Äúimagine if they drafted Ball‚Äù."
"Well there was that Jalen Rose story about the Warriors telling Lamelo on draft night a few minutes before the pick that they were going to select him. People may question the legitimacy of that story but Rose is a credible source in this case. He‚Äôs as plugged in to the ball family as any media personality. He had several workouts with Lamelo before the draft and is good friends with Lamelo‚Äôs manager Jermaine Jackson as they‚Äôre both from Detroit. This coupled with the video of Lamelo himself signaling the number 2 with his hands indicating that‚Äôs where he thought he was gonna be drafted, and the story seems totally believable. I also don‚Äôt buy this narrative that he didn‚Äôt want to go to the Warriors or that he purposely tanked his interview with them. I mean you gotta know how to give a good interview in order to know how to tank one. I‚Äôm sure he just gave the standard Lamelo interview (which if you‚Äôve ever seen one you know what I‚Äôm talking about) and the warriors just read way too much into it.   Obviously Lavar was outspoken about not wanting him on the Warriors but when Lamelo was asked about his dad‚Äôs comments and how he envisioned himself fitting next to Steph he quickly separated himself from his father‚Äôs beliefs: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm my on man he‚Äôs his own man ‚Äî he has his opinions I have mine. Like I said I feel like I can play on any team, do good anywhere I go so anything that happens I‚Äôm positive‚Ä¶ Anywhere is a great fit, it‚Äôs the nba you put me with good players( in reference to playing with Steph) I feel like it‚Äôs even gonna be better‚Äù. Additionally, there was even an Instagram live video of Jalen Rose talking with Jermaine Jackson and briefly Lamelo literally hours before the draft. I‚Äôm paraphrasing but Jackson said something along the lines of it‚Äôd be nice if the Warriors drafted Lamelo because it would be easier for his family to come to the games since he‚Äôs a Cali kid. I wish I could find the video, but Lamelo‚Äôs really big on family so I think he would have relished the opportunity to essentially stay home."
"Curry moves well off ball, LaMelo always finds weird passing angles. If ever it enhances GSW's offense, LaMelo will always find Klay and Steph. Plus while Ball isn't a great shooter, he's a better stand-still shooter than an on-the-move shooter.  Warriors didn't need a center, Looney would be serviceable. Plus they would have a surplus of bigs who would want to play in that pass-happy system.   Whatever the reason for the Warriors reneging on their draft promise to LaMelo, it was a bad decision."
LaMelo on GSW would be too much of a good thing. Him and Curry would both want the ball too much and it would create problems.
"What makes you say Trae and Luka are leaders? As far as I know they are both more ""lead by example"" types, which usually means they are just the best players but not really a leader.  If we are talking about young players though, Ja tops the list as an immediate leader. I'd also put Cole Anthony and in his own weird way, LaMelo Ball as young leaders on their teams.  I think Cade Cunningham and Scottie Barnes will be that as well.  I think a lot of it can be developed with experience, but it depends on locker room dynamics as much as anything. Bam wasn't really a leader when he was drafted, but under UD's mentorship he basically has become one. It's not super neccessary with Butler and Lowry there, but he's a good example of someone developing those traits."
"From the recent [M.Poole article](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/why-james-wiseman-lamelo-ball-debate-cant-be-concluded-yet):  &gt;[Big] men almost always require the longest adjustment period. The last five players named Rookie of the Year are point guards or primary ballhandlers, and 13 of the last 20 fall into that category.  &gt;In the 22 years since Tim Duncan ‚Äì a four-year collegian ‚Äì earned the award (1998), only two centers, Amar√© Stoudemire and Emeka Okafor, have gotten it."
"Alright, lets see how it goes. I simply see some severe limitations in his game that dont make me that optimistic. Im kind of curious to know why you think that. He's slow doesnt have the ability to defend or stay in front of the ball, doesnt have great range and is a slightly below average shooter. I think he can be a great playmaker when he isn't too focused on trying to score himself and converting bad looks, but I dont think that gives him top 1 potential in 5 years. I think Ja Morant, LaMelo, Trae, Zion, Murray, Mitchell and Ayton all seem a bit better than Luka (from the young new players)"
"&gt; I think the best case scenario would be if somehow the Hawks could land Tatum to play alongside Trae and Collins.  I mean... how? This is an absolute pipe dream of basically unfathomable circumstances. Also I don't think it's really a good fit at all... Tatum is a number 1 or a KD style number 2 (meaning how on those Thunder teams, Westbrook might have the ball more and might occasionally shoot more, but KD was clearly the better player). Tatum can't be that next to Trae who is easily a number 1.   Tatum would be best with someone like 2-years ago Chris Paul or a Lamelo/Lonzo type. It might be a bit too early to tell on Lamelo, but Tatum needs a good PG who doesn't look to score first. It's a waste of Trae's scoring to pair him with Tatum. They're both #1s."
- Ja Morant  - Tyler Herro  - LaMelo Ball
"I really doubt this because it's so dumb and short sighted. Like he's already had 2 major injuries because of that weight. And think of the national media attention / money he's lost out on because of that.  Also it just reeks as uncompetitive to me. And who would want that on their team? A dude who would legit sit out 5 years of play to not play for a team like wtf?? You don't see LaMelo Ball sitting out every year of play on the Hornets. And it's not like this Pelicans roster is SO BAD that it requires sitting out the entire season and breaking your foot. If Zion was here we'd be like 3-4 / 4-3 we're not losing by much, we'd almost certainly make a play-in game / playoffs if he was healthy. He's giving that up so that in 2 years he can take the QO??"
is this the new ball thing (not LaMelo)?
1. Anthony Edwards  2. Lamelo Ball  3. Cole Anthony   4. Tyrese Haliburton  5. Saddiq Bey / Desmond Bane / Jaden McDaniels / Tyrese Maxey
"east all stars right now: starters - Zach Lavine, Lamelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Giannis bench - Demar Derozan, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Brad Beal, Miles Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid  after that there‚Äôs still guys like OG, Harden, Middleton, etc... who‚Äôll be in the running. Depending on injuries I can maybe see Brown making it."
Lamelo actually holds up defensively on ball. Had a couple of highlight plays and is pretty decent at ball denial on guards. Now getting thru screens and not ball watching/chasing? Definitely needs some serious work.
&gt;he's been the 2nd best player of his draft class.  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Anthony Edwards  You think he's better than one of them?

Lavar Ball deserves an award. 4 years ago NO ONE believed his sons would be must-see TV. Now Lonzo and LaMelo are precisely that. Bulls and Hornets are 2 of my fav teams to watch now and those boys are big reasons why
"Lamelo ball on the hornets has been a blast to watch, the bulls have some great players and a good team now and most portland games come down to dame lillard he makes every game worth watching just stay away from piston games they will put you to sleep"
"Could have had LaMelo Ball on this roster, probably would be West favorites right now."
Lamelo ball is so good and he‚Äôs only 20 years old. It‚Äôs insane
"Why would I?  They didn't take LaMelo Ball, I have nothing to be upset about here."
"&gt; Referencing his trade value is only to prove a point  So you're aware that there's no such player, and there's actually no way the Warriors could turn LaMelo Ball into an upgrade, and therefore he would have been a terrible pick for the Warriors?  Good talk."
"When Lamelo comes out early, that's when the ball movement slows and we look so sloppy in the first. I like his aggressiveness on the defensive end, but I wish he would start at the end of the 2nd Q"
"Oh yeah. I guess it was notable enough but I doubt it had *that* much weight. If they liked Lamelo much more they would've said ""Lamelo came to dinner with his parents and you can really see that behind his brashness, Lavar has a lot of knowledge and passion for the game, and has instilled a blah blah blah - glowing things..."" then picked Ball second."
"This hurts me. We could have Lamelo Ball, and according to his father, we even promised to pick him before the draft. Instead we chose future investment that doesn't do anything for the rest 2-3 years of peak Steph. I don't think Warriors front office has made one decent move out of their confort zone, just constantly picking up someone else's trash and try to somehow make do."
"Referencing his trade value is only to prove a point, which is that 30 out of 30 front offices would rather have LaMelo Ball than James Wiseman. So yes, if Bob Myers could get a mulligan you can bet your ass he'd take LaMelo the second time around.  You can admit you've never seen LaMelo Ball play before."
"&gt; LaMelo with Steph would be basketball porn.  My basketball porn isn't ""another, inferior player takes away Steph's touches"".  He's wrong for the Warriors playstyle, and I *like* the Warriors playstyle. Ball movement, team offense, bringing the ball up by committee - one thousand percent my jam.  Being yet another team with a ball-dominant guard would be a massive downgrade. Meanwhile, the best true 5 the Warriors have had since Bogut is Javale McGee. (Looney is a 4 who plays out of position for the sake of the team.)"
"Yeah, would've been so much better for the Warriors to take yet another fucking guard since we have so little guard depth and are overloaded with bigs.  LaMelo would be a terrible pick for the Warriors. He's useless without the ball in his hands. The Warriors don't play like that. To get his stats Ball has a higher usage rate than anyone on the Warriors not named Steph Curry."
"And if lamelo develops into the GOAT?   Let's get out of fantasy land and focus on reality. Based on what we have seen from both, it's unreasonable to suggest wiseman will be a better player in the future barring injuries.   The modern game is built around pick and roll ball handlers, not athletic role guys. The case for picking Wiseman hinged on LaMelo being a flawed prospect who wouldn't translate to the NBA. Now that we know his game translates, we can take that predraft concern off the table."
"I'm not enthusiastic about him being a major minutes player this year.   But I think the people down on him long-term are too low on him.  People normally under-appreciate the importance of age in player evaluations, and in his case - no senior college season, no rookie summer league or training camp, no second year summer league or training camp - we should expect him to be raw even by normally young-big standards. The stuff he really has to learn - big man defense - can't really be learned without reps.   I saw some great instincts last year. I think he could be a special player. I think he'll probably always be seen as someone who should have been picked after LaMelo by the general public (because LaMelo will have the ball in his hands and score more) but I'm not convinced that he'll actually be a worse player.   But I also think it'll be close to a miracle if he's capable of contributing by the postseason this year."
"Expect everyone else from his class is having incredible careers so far and setting themselves up as primetime players and gonna get max contracts. Fuckin LaMelo Ball is out here making a bigger name for himself than Zion.  ""Oh man he doesn't wanna play for the pelicans so he's gonna tank 5 years out of his career."" That's dumb as shit. More like the dude can't eat properly or take care of his own body.   Newsflash, if you're a good player, you start your career on a bad team. Woah, yeah the draft works that way. You can still have great games, make playoffs, do well, make a brand for yourself, all on that bad team. Every great player has done it. It's more like Zion is childish and unable to take care of himself, so he's nearly putting himself out of the league if this keeps up. That's more likely than ""He's tanking himself for 5 years so that he doesn't put on mileage"" you mean multiple injuries in a row isn't mileage?  Also, again as you don't watch basketball I assume, Valanciunas has been destroying it so far and is worth every penny. This team could make the playoffs, if Zion doesn't eat himself out of a season."
I'm in the boat that says Wiseman will never live up to the #2 pick and will always be compared to LaMelo and how the Warriors reneged on their promise to draft Ball at the last minute because Lacob wanted Wiseman.  So yeah he's our Bagley. Fuck.
I was half considering getting a Lamelo Ball city edition and I'm not even a Hornets fan...  Somehow every year y'all just shit on everyone else
https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/11/1/22756535/lamelo-ball-charlotte-hornets  That link does a good job describing the offense they run.
"Borrego is a member of the Popovich coaching tree, and his coaching style is heavily influenced by the Spurs motion concepts. It actually reminds me a lot of the Warriors scheme, which would make sense since Kerr learned from Coach Pop too.   If you were to compare the Hornets to the Warriors, LaMelo would play Draymond‚Äôs role as the primary initiator, Rozier would play Klay‚Äôs role as a wing shooter, and Hayward/Bridges would each contribute a bit of what Curry does, as a guy that can space the floor and create shots for himself and others. The Hornets also share some defensive similarities with the Warriors too. Like them, the Hornets play a lot of small ball, with PJ Washington at the 5.   I‚Äôm pretty sure the Hornets are actually ranked #3 in assists so far this season, with 27.4 per game. They ended last season at #3 too, behind the Warriors and Pacers."

"I haven‚Äôt watched enough of Lamelo to know how he stands up defensively to Lonzo, but I feel like Lonzo‚Äôs defense puts him a step ahead. Like he isn‚Äôt gonna bang 3‚Äôs back to back but he might prevent the steals that stop it from happening to him. I‚Äôm a big fan of the whole ball family after the drama stopped, they‚Äôre some fucking talented guys."
"&gt;but the hornets offense basically seems like wait til LaMelo hits you with the ball.  Uhhhhh yeah no. I think people that don't watch the Hornets have this weird perception that the entire Hornets offense runs through LaMelo and it couldn't be further from the truth. We just move the ball well as a team and our offense is pretty balanced, it's pretty much a different 2 players every night that will lead the scoring effort."
"Your system is also much more forgiving than the Warriors motion offense which KO just didn‚Äôt have the IQ to figure out. I know I‚Äôm simplifying this, but the hornets offense basically seems like wait til LaMelo hits you with the ball. That‚Äôs much better for KO. This is why you can‚Äôt just evaluate a player in a vacuum. You have to consider fit and play style."
"If you guys pay attention, you can see that the guy thought Lamelo was passing the ball between him and the other defender and he tried to intercept it. He probably did slip in something but he definitely thought Lamelo was passing it"
Ppl use to call him the french lamelo ball lol. every time I watch him play he doesnt look to score.
"Just last year, LaMelo Ball went scoreless on his first NBA game. He went on to win the rookie of the year award, and now this year he‚Äôs taken another leap.   It‚Äôs way too early to judge Cade Cunningham!"

"he's in his prime  how long he stays there is predicated on health  but given he's a big man with a history of health issues.........i doubt he stays in his prime long  and once he declines , it'll be like falling off a cliff   my guess is Lakers brass probably thinking about the future - maybe get Anthony Edwards and Lamelo Ball years down the road"
"Miles Bridges, Lamelo Ball, Gordan Heyward, Terry Rozier, and PJ Washington at the 5"

Unleash Lamelo Ball
"Me and my friends played basketball at this rec center once a week in Orange County (feels like forever ago now with COVID). This place is basically a grid of hardwood basketball courts separated with nets, and the courts get rented out to whoever. Most of the time, the courts are rented out to youth classes or rec leagues.  So one particularly slow week, we only have a 3v3 going on one of the courts. Our overall skill level isn't particularly noteworthy on our best days, and this wasn't one of our best days. The game was definitely below the rim that day. There's a bunch of young kids who are much more athletic than us on the courts on either side of us, but whatever, we're trying to get our steps in.  Yadda yadda yadda, we're in the middle of our very ordinary game, and one of us hits a very fundamental 15-foot baseline jumper. Suddenly, this kid who's walking through the courts at the time hugs the dude who made the shot and jumps up and down like he'd just won the NBA Finals. After about 10 seconds of this, he walks off with two friends like nothing happened.  It's not the craziest thing I've ever witnessed on a basketball court, so I'm ready to move on, but the dude who just got hugged actually looks like he won the Finals, so I want to give him a bit of time. After a few beats, he's like, ""Hey, that was Lamelo Ball.""  Which makes sense, because LaVar's JBA was renting out the gym that week. At the time, I was pretty sure he wouldn't make it (I think this was Lonzo's rookie year), but I'm definitely rooting for him now. Good luck, you crazy crazy man."
"Damn, another nice game for Ball.  Wiseman might lose out on ROY if the Warriors keep ignoring him and failing to get the ball in his hands.  Edwards and Lamelo are getting prime opportunities"
