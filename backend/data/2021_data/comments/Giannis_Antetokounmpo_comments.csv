I love Jokic but that's just disrespectful to Giannis. He is better both in defence and in offence.  He scores more points and creates more points.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6.

Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
We've seen Giannis Antetokounmpo underperform in two consecutive high level playoff series directly because of a glaring flaw in his game that can be exploited.   Kyrie Irving shooting like crap in one playoff run means dick. Players have bad overall 9 game stretches all the time. I don't think he can be the best player on a championship team but to suggest that 21 PPG on 49% TS is what you should expect from him in the playoffs because it happened once is pure stupidity.
"Coming off the bench: LeBron James, Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, and Hames Harden."
"In your mind, what makes Jokic so much less marketable than Giannis Antetokounmpo?   They’re both quiet Europeans with difficult-to-pronounce names that play in small markets (though Giannis’s market is actually significantly smaller than Jokic’s), so in your mind, why would the NBA be ok with Giannis winning back-to-back but rig things to prevent Jokic from winning one?  Because, if you ask me, your entire asinine conspiracy kinda falls apart if you actually do the extensive research required to, ya know, look at who won the last two MVP awards."

"Yep, that sounds completely different from the well-known, boisterous off-the-court personality of reigning two-time MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo..."
No I’m saying that the argument that people don’t recognize the two time mvp who’s got a nickname that’s the “Greek freak” and has a thick accent is actually a black American and not Greek is a weak stance.   To add I mean his name is Giannis Antetokounmpo. How do people think he’s not European?
"You are voted down but literally everyone around him dwarf him in accomplishments.  Steph had a slow start in his career + he was mediocre defensively + no FMVPs ,(mostly because he was *actually* the no 2 in 2 of their titles in every way measurable). History would be way way less kind to him.  People are incredibly high on him because he is an offensive player + current player. Heck even Kawhi Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo beat him in personal accomplishments already, but I guess their work in the defensive end is not as flashy.  Contrast him with Moses Malone. A multi MVP with MVPs and presence in all defensive teams. His personal accolades put him in top 15 all time. But most people don't know because they were not around, so they speculatation ignore his dominance.   I think such lists (which are popularity votes), i.e. popular guys go further up in the list, should always be contrasted with sth more objective. I am using a list consisted of personal accomplishments on which I have attached certain weight to tuem (multi fMVP is better than multi MVP which is better than multi DPoY, which is better than multi 1st team selections, etc).  In that list you see legends like Mutombo and in defensive players treated way more kindly and offense only guys to be way more down in the list. Maybe I will post it one day. In such a list Curry is in the top 30s ahead of Nash, which IMO is where he belongs all time. He *is* an improved Nash who got more hype because he played in a more stacked team."
"Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo (/ˈjɑːnɪs ˈɑːntɛtəˈkuːmpoʊ/[1] Greek: Γιάννης Σίνα-Ούγκο Αντετοκούνμπο,[2] IPA: [ˈʝanis adetoˈkumbo]; born December 6, 1994 is a Greek professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
"&gt;One or 2 games doesn’t mean shut down lol. It needs to happen over the course of the series  Well then Antetokounmpo -- and lots of players who don't make $50M -- has never been ""shut down"", either.  &gt; and he was playing injured in the finals.  Again, if you want to pay $50M for an oft-injured player, be my guest.  &gt; AD shoots harder shots than Giannis   Well shit, if Davis plays with the league's assist leader and still takes bad shots, I guess Antetokounmpo is a lot better.  &gt;You’re lying to yourself if you actually believe Giannis is a better shooter.   Antetokounmpo's shots go in the basket more frequently.  This makes him a better shooter.  You are lying to everyone if you think that's not how it works."
"&gt;Every single player you mentioned as Davis help had injury issues.  A ""generational"" player makes the playoffs anyway.  &gt;And if you legitimately think that the Pelicans had a chance against the warriors you’re being delusional.   Had they reliably made the playoffs, they would've had some other opponents to face.  &gt;Ask any player GM or anybody who they’d rather have shooting the ball against them and 95+% will say Giannis.   This unsupported fantasy aside -- no one has ever yet needed to build a wall against Davis -- the fact remains that Antetokounmpo was almost exactly as efficient as Davis last year, and without the enormous help of the league's assist leader, and best player.  &gt;Giannis isn’t a top 5 postseason player maybe regular season but not postseason   The fact remains that Antetokounmpo was better in last year's playoffs than Davis was.  He just didn't have James."
"&gt;How is it ADs fault that he had bad teams?   And was he expected to beat the warriors with Solomon Hill and E’twuan Moore?   He had enough help not to face the Warriors in the first round on the rare occasion they even made the playoffs.  Davis/Holiday/Anderson/Gordon/Evans couldn't even make the playoffs twice in three years, and then were the 8th seed.  By the way, the 2018 Warriors only won 58 games in a very weak western conference, and faced one of the weakest slate of playoff opponents in history -- and lost games to 3.  They were not some unbeatable juggernaut, despite their roster on paper.    &gt;And you’re lying to yourself if you believe Giannis is even in the same stratosphere as AD in terms of shooting.   They are in exactly the same stratosphere, and Antetokounmpo is two years younger -- and better from three and from 16' to the arc this season.  Should Davis be better?  Yes.  Is he?  No.  &gt;If you replace AD with Giannis last year Lakers wouldn’t have won it all.  Him and LeBron are a bad fit together.   Rank nonsense.  Fit does not matter when you have two of the top 5 players in the league."
LeBron got carried by Ray Allen and Allen deserved the 2013 FMVP  LeBron can average a 35 point triple-double but chooses not to   Giannis Antetokounmpo is a bust(This was said in 2019 after his loss to Miami) because he can’t cut it in the playoffs   Dame Lillard could have taken Curry’s place on the Warriors dynasty and they still would have won  Steve Nash was an average Point Guard but got hyped up because he’s white  The Worst: Russell Westbrook is autistic and struggles with social interaction
"&gt;Giannis can’t shoot   He's shooting better from three than Davis this season.  &gt;and he put up those numbers as the 1st option and AD did it as the 2nd.  And which do you suppose is harder, being the first option or being the second behind LeBron James -- who led the league in assists?  Davis took 0.8 fewer shots per game than Antetokounmpo in the playoffs last year.  &gt;AD would’ve made the playoffs all those years too if he was in the East.   ""Woulda coulda shoulda"" doesn't cut it for $50M.  And that claim is doubtful anyway, some of Davis' Pelicans teams were bad.  &gt; AD is built for post season success   Yet he had none without James.  &gt;Giannis is the better floor raiser no doubt but AD is clearly the better ceiling raiser   Nonsense terms.  Antetokounmpo is the superior player, and still two years younger.  As I said previously, if you think the Lakers win last year without James, or that Milwaukee doesn't win with him, you are delusional.   The only thing Davis has done better in his career to date is get traded to the Lakers."
"&gt;Name one player who can do everything AD does.  Antetokounmpo.    &gt;And he’s a post season performer so he’s not gonna win a regular season award.    Without James, Davis managed to play just 13 playoff games, and lost 8.  For $50M, you need make the playoffs regularly, and beat more than one team.  &gt;There’s a reason Giannis gets shut down in the playoffs and AD doesn’t   In last year's playoffs, one of them averaged 27.7 / 9.7 / 3.5 on 60.3% effective shooting, and the other averaged 26.7 / 13.8 / 5.7 on 59.9% effective.  One had LeBron James on his team, too.  If you think the Lakers win last year without James, or that Milwaukee doesn't win with him, you are delusional."

"Watch some nuggets basketball before dropping these trash takes.   I think you meant leads the league* in every game  ""If advanced numbers and analytics are more your speed, you probably don’t even need to be talked into Jokić for MVP. He owns 10.7 win shares, 3.4 more than Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert, who are tied for second in the NBA. It’s the widest win-share margin the league NBA has seen since 2015–16—the year that Warriors star Stephen Curry, who finished the season ahead by 3.4 win shares, became the league’s first unanimous MVP. (Just in case you’re wondering if that’s due solely to the time Embiid and James have missed, it’s not. He holds the edge over Embiid and James—and the rest of the NBA—in win shares per 48 minutes, too.)  More historical context: Jokić’s season [currently ranks as one of the six best of all-time](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/bpm_season.html)—trailing only LeBron’s 2008–09 season, a trio of Michael Jordan campaigns and Curry’s unanimous MVP year—in box plus-minus, which measures a player’s box-score contributions to his team while on the court. While that might seem preposterous on its face, it may not be as far off as you think when looking at everything Jokić excels at within the context of his team, which … [he leads in nearly every conceivable statistic](https://twitter.com/Herring_NBA/status/1374889838298693638?s=20)."""

Always dunkin like GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO
"&gt;If so many players have the passing skill of jokic but centers just don’t use it because of “era” or because it’s a waste of energy, then why is he a better facilitator than all but single digit NBA PGs?  He's not.  Many teams utilize multiple ball-handlers, so looking simply at assists-per-game is extremely ""shallow analysis"".  Jokic averages a whopping 2 assists per game more than Antetokounmpo, and handles the ball a lot more.  Is Giannis one of the greatest passing bigs now, too?  No.  &gt;Nuggets will plausibly be the 3rd seed in about 10 days.   Maybe, and due to opponents' injuries.  I suppose that hoping your opponents' all get hurt is a strategy, but it's a very ""shallow"" one.  And by the way, wow, the 3rd seed in the conference huh?  What could possibly be better than that?  Maybe they should hang a banner, or build a statue.  &gt;Like citing a team that went 7 games against one of the best superteams in NBA history  It would behoove you to educate yourself a bit.  That was not one of the best teams in NBA history -- they won only 58 games, in the weakest Western Conference in years, and then faced one of the weakest slates of playoffs opponents ever, and lost games to all but one of them.  Great on paper is meaningless, unless -- in your ""shallow analysis"" -- you think the 2013 Lakers were also a great team.  Furthermore, the point -- which screamed by your head -- was that a high regular season net rating often precedes a second-round or Conference Final exit.  Just like the one Denver suffered last year.  If that's all you ever want to experience, I suppose that's fine.  Myself, as a Laker fan, I prefer going the Finals.  Been there like 30 times now, it's enjoyable.  Everyone should go there once, ya know, for the experience. Like visiting the the Grand Canyon.  But hey, if you prefer your earlier playoff exits and your prized net rating, well, to each, his own.  Good luck with that."
"If Giannis Antetokounmpo marries Georgios Papagiannis, his name would legally change to Giannis Papagiannis"
"I googled it and found this https://www.characters.gr/site/en/stories/world/Giannis-Antetokounmpo-en  “Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece on December 6, 1994. Three years earlier, his parents had moved from Lagos, Nigeria, to Greece, leaving behind their first born son, Francis, with his grandparents”"
"If he ends the season with very strong numbers while the Nuggets stop their hot streak, it is very possible to see Embiid still winning. Recency bias is pretty strong, and last season, while playing incredibly, LeBron was still pretty much behind Antetokounmpo, but if I recall, the bubble increased his MVP campaign to the point that there was people thinking he should be the MVP, not Giannis.  Also, I don't want to see it happening, but anyone playing can get injured, including Jokic. If he also loses time, not only Embiid increases his chances by a lot, but also other candidates like Harden. Of course, If that is what it takes to see Embiid winning a MVP, I would rather see Jokic taking it this year for sure. There were too many injuries this season already."
It’s because he playing right now 20 years ago it was all MJ was the GOAT 15 years ago it was KOBE 5 years it’s going to luka or Giannis Antetokounmpo
"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Stephen Curry 4. Nikola Jokic 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Anthony Davis 10. Luka Doncic 11. Damian Lillard  Right off the top of my head, im sure a couple players could be swapped if I sat down for a couple hours and and used more than the eye test and knowledge readily available. BIG believer in Jokic, but I truly feel 2-7 is interchangeable. Took playoffs into account but I didnt pin my whole argument on them. Hardest to rank was Kawhi, hes damn good but I feel like his impact in the regular season is lacking and he is an overrated playoff performer after last years utter failure. 9-11 could also be swapped around."

"I'm citing an article, I have no clue about speaking/pronouncing Yoruba or Greek. It's worth noting there are more [articles](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-greek-freak-how-to-say-giannis-antetokounmpo-2017-4?r=US&amp;IR=T) that say the same thing - after consulting Giannis:   ""During the playoffs, Ruocco was a guest on ESPN’s “The Dan Le Batard Show,” where he explained why he knows his pronunciation is correct, how he learned the name and the keys to saying it right.  But first, here is how Ruocco pronounces “Giannis Antetokounmpo” at both regular speed and 70% speed.  When Le Batard asked Ruocco if he felt he was pronouncing the name correctly, not only was Ruocco adamant that he was (“I am 100% sure”), but he also made a compelling case.  'I have asked [Antetokounmpo],” said Ruocco. “I have also gotten lessons from people who speak his [Yoruba] language.”  Ruocco then explained what most people get wrong about the last name.  “The difference is that the T is actually pronounced as a D and the P in the end is actually a B,” Ruocco told Le Batard.  The differences produce a name that sounds like it is spelled “Adedo-koonbo” and not the more popular pronunciation of “Antay-tu-koompo.”'  I think when it comes to prounouncing names we should probably listen to the person whose name it is..."
"&gt;Because they fell ass backwards into Giannis at 15.   &gt;   &gt;Congrats on hitting the non-lottery lottery.

A player who has only managed to play 3 seasons of games in 7 years.  &gt; I don't understand why it's so awful to throw 3 years to get 4+ of being among the best in the NBA   Well that 4+ remains to be seen.  The Sixers were 6th in the East last year, and have not yet been above 3rd.  They haven't yet gone further in the playoffs than they did a year before starting the tank.  That said, I didn't say it was awful.  It just isn't necessary, as shown by Milwaukee.  And Boston.  And Denver.  And Utah, so far, and others in the past."

"Not saying Scott Brooks isn't ass (he is), but Westbrook on Giannis was not awful. Westbrook actually defends isolations well, even against people way bigger than him. There was like 3 straight plays on Saturday's game where Westbrook was on Giannis and played him well. Here's a couple that I could find:  [1](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=129&amp;GameID=0022000589&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Antetokounmpo%20Bad%20Pass%20Turnover%20) [2](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=139&amp;GameID=0022000589&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Forbes%20Bad%20Pass%20Turnover%20)   The problem is that any time the Bucks got out in transition, the Wizards won't guard the 3 point line and between these plays they got 6 points of transition 3's."

"Giannis Antetokounmpo is an absolute animal. From what I've heard, he's a good basketball player. Winning often, losing rarely type of vibes. If he comes to San Antonio, we're going to be one of the scariest competitors in the league 😈"
"Giannis' mom one hundred percent. No doubt the Currey brothers got some great genetics, but they also grew up in NBA locker rooms and got some of the best training/coaching a kid could probably get. The Antetokounmpo brothers are physical freaks, you can't teach that shit."
Giannis Antetokounmpo declined an invitation to the 3-Point Contest.
"First of all, the OP completely butchers shit - the article is paywalled, so most people won't notice, but he actually selectively quotes and moves stuff around. The other thing is that what's lost in the quoting is that Lowe is talking about the ""discourse"" of the MVP race and not talking about his personal justification. Here's the full quotes and I'll bold the stuff the OP quoted.  &gt;The discourse surrounding last year's top two finishers -- the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James -- was primed to get messy and interesting and maybe a little edgy in the media even before Harden and two behemoth centers crashed the MVP race. Antetokounmpo has won the past two MVPs, outpointing James easily last season.  &gt;Antetokounmpo's statistical case was almost unassailable -- at least according to almost every publicly available statistic. He also won Defensive Player of the Year. The Bucks finished with the best record in the NBA.  &gt;And then the world went haywire, and for whatever reason -- including the Miami Heat exposing the remaining holes in Antetokounmpo's game -- **the Bucks flamed out in the postseason. James and the Lakers rose up. It was a reaffirmation: Duh, LeBron is still the best player when it matters.** In celebrating the title, James, stone-faced, demanded his ""damn respect.""  &gt;As our Brian Windhorst noted last month, James has not won MVP since 2013. You can explain away each individual season. I've had an official ballot in every season starting in 2013-14, and have not voted James as MVP in any of them. At the time, each vote felt fine -- close in some seasons, but fine. I don't regret any of them now. In totality, **it still seems undeniably stupid that that guy we all recognize as the best player alive has not won MVP in eight years.** It just does.  Then you skip a couple of paragraphs talking about why voters might be reluctant to award Giannis his 3rd straight MVP (it would put him in an exclusive club) he talks about how James is probably behind Jokic, Embiid, and Giannis statistically.  The rest of the article is about the more fringe MVP candidates (Dame, Luka, Curry, Kawhi) and how Harden will impact it."

"&gt;This is in part a direct result of the premium on shooting: the guys who are great drivers and finishers but can't shoot from deep don't really have a place in the league anymore.  That's just not true didn't we all just witness [Jimmy Butler put up 40 in the Finals without making a 3.](https://www.nba.com/news/jimmy-butler-triple-double-finals) Jimmy was the first player to do that since Shaq did it in 2002. I would argue that there are definitely places for those guys in the league, guys like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Giannis Antetokounmpo have the ability to score but they usually just look and play differently in this area. In this area, those guys have to be a physically dominant point forward type players and are be able to play bully ball in the post and run freely and physically dominant opponents in the halfcourt, or else it's much harder for them to exist. Zion is another good example of this because although he can sometimes shoot the three, he prefers to score mostly in the paint. Another key point to this is being a good free-throw shooter which why I would argue Jimmy Butler is the most prominent and best prototype of this type of scorer in the NBA.   The other type of player that can thrive nowadays without being able to shoot from deep, is a guard, particularly one who is either incredibly athletic and/or skilled whose best skill is usually their vision and passing rather than their ability to score (although most of these players can and do have multiple ways to score but are generally pass-first point guards). Guards like De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and to a lesser extent Demar Derozan. As I mentioned before these guards with the exception of Derozan (although he has become a much better playmaker in his Spurs era) are pass-first guards which means that they look to make plays and find their teammates before scoring. It's also to note that when most of these guards do score they score either in the paint or the mid-range because they either have the physical strength like Luka does to body other players and easily get to the paint or the free-throw line or they have the handles, athleticism and quickness like Fox, Morant, and Westbrook do to blow pass their opponents to finish at the rim."
"Homer take. The MBC jokes are all time material over there, and come crawling out of literally every thread. ""Whats-the-scoop-tho"" is the most iconic iteration of Giannis' surname, as an credentialed taxonometrician of copypasta, we are 1-2 years out of seeing the Antetokounmpo pastas really marinate and develop."
"Currently, the consensus Vegas odds are as follows.  LeBron James	+350  Nikola Jokic	+440  Joel Embiid	+550  Kevin Durant	+750  Luka Doncic	+750  Steph Curry	+1200  Giannis Antetokounmpo	+1300"
"That seems like a crazy good defensive lineup.   Jrue Holiday, top-tier guard defender  Donte DiVincenzo, apparently a decent perimeter defender  Kris Middleton, great wing defender  Giannis Antetokounmpo, reigning DPOY  Brook Lopez, elite paint protector  How does anyone ever score on them? Hopefully I'll see tonight, lol."
"East front court is stacked but I definitely think he makes it. Here is a table of the players that I think are genuine contenders for an All-Star spot in the East front court, with the players I deem to current be a lock bolded. Sabonis is 90% of the way to being a lock and I'd be really surprised if he didn't make it at this stage.        |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |**Kevin Durant**|F|E|BRK|16|30.9|7.4|5.6|0.8|1.4|2.9|0.520|0.447|0.873| |**Joel Embiid**|F|E|PHI|16|28.3|11.1|2.8|1.2|1.3|1.2|0.544|0.404|0.840| |**Giannis Antetokounmpo**|F|E|MIL|19|27.3|11.0|5.7|1.1|1.1|1.2|0.558|0.280|0.593| |**Jayson Tatum**|F|E|BOS|13|26.8|7.0|3.7|1.2|0.7|3.1|0.484|0.435|0.833| |Jerami Grant|F|E|DET|20|23.6|5.9|2.9|0.9|1.1|2.6|0.448|0.402|0.866| |Gordon Hayward|F|E|CHO|20|23.0|5.3|3.6|1.3|0.6|2.3|0.503|0.430|0.856| |Nikola Vučević|F|E|ORL|21|22.6|10.9|3.5|1.1|0.5|2.7|0.478|0.441|0.837| |Julius Randle|F|E|NYK|22|22.4|11.1|6.0|0.8|0.2|1.4|0.471|0.369|0.816| |Khris Middleton|F|E|MIL|20|21.2|6.4|6.0|1.1|0.2|2.7|0.517|0.458|0.922| |\**Domantas Sabonis**|F|E|IND|20|20.6|12.0|5.7|0.8|0.4|0.9|0.543|0.327|0.696| |Tobias Harris|F|E|PHI|18|20.3|7.0|2.7|0.9|1.0|2.2|0.514|0.464|0.833| |Bam Adebayo|F|E|MIA|18|20.1|9.3|5.3|0.8|0.9|0.1|0.588|0.400|0.860|"
"They have changed their offensive scheme and are trying to find the sweet spot:  &gt; With a different base scheme that puts a greater focus on offensive rebounding, Milwaukee is still excelling. And yet, Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA’s back-to-back most valuable player, is posting his worst numbers of the last three seasons. &gt;  &gt; Antetokounmpo is averaging 27 points, 10.5 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game with an effective field goal percentage of 58.4 percent this season, which are still quite good. But those statistics are all lower than in his first two seasons with Budenholzer. On top of that, Antetokounmpo isn’t feeling as comfortable as he did in the team’s previous offensive scheme. &gt;  &gt; “It’s weird, it’s weird, but as I said, I’m figuring it out,” Antetokounmpo said. “I’d love to come out and have 30, 35 and it be easy. Easy layups and dunks and all that. But having somebody in ‘the dunker’ might make it a little bit harder. &gt;  &gt; “But at the end of the day, you gotta do other things to impact the game. Find your teammates. Set better screens. Go for handoffs. Roll when you set screens. You just gotta find ways.” &gt;  &gt; As Pat Connaughton explained earlier this season, one of the Bucks’ priorities with their new offensive scheme was making it tougher for teams to build “the wall” at the free-throw line. By moving Antetokounmpo from the top of the key to the wing and placing a teammate in “the dunker” spot, the Bucks have been able to take away the wall.  &gt; But there’s just one problem. The wall hasn’t disappeared. It has just moved to a different spot on the floor, disrupting the moves Antetokounmpo makes off the dribble. &gt;  &gt; “Having somebody in ‘the dunker,’ it’s hard,” Antetokounmpo said. “You gotta now almost program yourself to know where your teammates are in the different positions. Things that worked in the past, you cannot do them as much now.”"

"no problem, it’s confusing because it’s a yoruba word, original spelling being “adetokunbo.” giannis’ family spelled it the greek way, “antetokounmpo,” presumably to fit in in greece back when he was young, like how his parents gave him a greek first name so they could assimilate into the culture easier."

"Depends how you are measuring impact, but for the past three years he is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic. With one exception, those were the top five finishers in the 2019-20 MVP vote (Jokic was 9th), while Gobert wasn’t mentioned on a single ballot.  I prefer these kinds of metrics versus 1st all-nba ballot nods and such, but to eachs own. I get an argument against 10 impact too"

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"&gt; I'm not sure if you've ever seen the Bucks play, but Antetokounmpo attracts plenty of attention.  And the Bucks have a lot better spacing than the Pelicans, all non-Giannis starters are shooting 35+% from 3 this season. It's much easier for teams to send extra bodies at Zion than Giannis.  If you haven't seen how much teams are either doubling Zion on the catch or having him see extra bodies at the rim then I'm not sure you've seen many Pelican games.  As a very quick and dirty example, 8.4% of Giannis' shots are when there is a defender 0-2 feet away. 45.8% are when there's a defender 2-4 feet away.  (So 54.2% of his shots have a defender within 4 feet).  22.4% of Zion's shots come with a defender 0-2 feet away. 63.2% with a defender 2-4 feet away (So 85.6% with a defender within 4 feet).  So a much much higher proportion of Zion's shots come with a defender either tight or very tight to him.  You'll have to find someone a bit better at playing with the advanced stats than me to cross reference that with how many of those shots are at the rim, to look at things like double teams etc if you want to get a proper comparison of their finishing rates at the rim. The example I've given is just something quick and simple to show that a much higher proportion of Zion's shots come with defenders close to him than Giannis."
"Wardell Stephen Curry II, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Dončić are the overrated trio."
"&gt;Due to the Pelicans lack of spacing Zion's often finishing around/through two or more defenders, probably more than Giannis does.  I'm not sure if you've ever seen the Bucks play, but Antetokounmpo attracts plenty of attention.    And no one is building a wall to stop Williamson. In fact, many teams are single-covering him.  The Lakers, for example, let Markieff Morris take him repeatedly -- which didn't work, and led to most of the points Williamson scored in that game."

That Greek reporter’s name? Giannis Antetokounmpo
"\&gt;Looking at Giannis' FGA here: [https://go.nba.com/2gb9](https://go.nba.com/2gb9)  he actually started out the game working in the post and in the PnR and  then abandoned it for some reason. Is the theory here that Bud told  Giannis to stop posting up and running PnR?  So, I looked this up. There are two postups in the first minute. That's it. The PnR you're referring to is a screen by Lopez for Giannis to drive, not what people refer to when they say that he should be used in the PnR. Then there's a ""let it fly"" three on the break and for the next 17 minutes he had two shot attempts, which were both long distance iso jumpers, of which he rebounded and dunked one. In the third he took 3 shots five minutes apart from each other, having taken no shot for the latter half of the quarter.  Is the theory here that Giannis wanted to go 17 minutes with two shots and after that to take three shots in the third? Is the theory here that he introduced the ""let it fly"" philosophy? Is he responsible for how static his teammates are when the ball is in his hands?  A coach who who doesn't make sure that his best offensive player doesn't stay multiple 5 or 10 minute stretches without shot attempts, especially on a team which doesn't have adequate firepower, is a coach who needs to coach better. A coach who doesn't make sure that half the attempts of his best offensive player aren't bad shots that he shouldn't be taking, is a coach that needs to coach better.  I mean, look at that:  Giannis Antetokounmpo Pullup Jump shot Made Shot 3PT Field Goal   08:07  Giannis Antetokounmpo Pullup Jump shot Missed Shot 2PT Field Goal 10:27  Giannis Antetokounmpo Pullup Jump shot Missed Shot 3PT Field Goal 03:33  He took his last shot of the first quarter with 8m left. Then he took his next shot early in the 2nd and didn't take another for 7 more minutes, until he started taking a few shots until half-time. Then, in the third:  Giannis Antetokounmpo Dunk Shot Made Shot 2PT Field Goal 10:43  Giannis Antetokounmpo Jump Shot Missed Shot 3PT Field Goal 05:30  Giannis Antetokounmpo Finger Roll Layup Shot Missed Shot 2PT Field Goal 05:05  That's... Bud. And bad. Actually, I was always wondering how Giannis is able to find rhythm in games, cause Bud's rotations are totally insane. If he can't score, if he can't find rhythm, if he turns it over, PUT HIM IN BETTER SITUATIONS. If he still can't, bench him. Not to keep him fresh, but to keep him from hurting the team.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;The idea that Bud is to blame for  Giannis' shot selection is baffling, he is a superstar, he takes the  shots he takes because he wants to.  Of course, that's just made up shit based on what he should/could supposedly do as a superstar. As a matter of fact, we have no evidence that the way he plays is not his coach's decision. On the contrary, we do have evidence that he's just following Bud's decisions. I'm saying this while believing that Giannis is responsible on multiple levels."

"He's probably better than Giannis Antetokounmpo. He's accomplished just as much in the playoffs (i.e. one real playoff victory) with a far worse Pelicans team around him than the Bucks that surrounded Antetokounmpo. If Davis had faced the crippled, maimed, desiccated excuse of a ""playoff team"" in the first round that the Bucks had the fortune to over the last couple of years, he'd have made the conference finals one time as well."

He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
"Idk about craziest, but these are some oddities I can think of:  Ersan Ilyasova is supposedly a guy named Arsen Ilyasov from Turkmenistan and three years older than he’s listed, as someone brought him to Turkey, fiddled with his legal documents and had him assume a slightly changed name to not arouse too much suspicion.  The tail end of the 2011 draft was filled with some...strange picks. The Lakers took Chukwudiebere Maduabum at 56, the Mavs took Tanguy Ngombo at 57, the Lakers (again) picked Ater Majok at 58, the Spurs picked Adam Hanga at 59, and of course, the Kings picked Isaiah Thomas at 60.  Maduabum averaged less than 1 ppg for the Bakersfield Jam the year he was drafted, which isn’t exactly a ringing endorsement. Ngombo is apparently six years older than originally listed, and is now a player for the Qatar national team. Majok has a 7’7” wingspan and ended up becoming part of Lebanon’s national team. I have no idea what happened to Hanga. And of course, IT made out well for himself despite the clusterfuck that is his post-Celtics career.  Bison Dele disappeared at sea, though it seems to be generally accepted that his brother (on board the same ship) killed him and his girlfriend and chucked their bodies into the water.  Jordan Crawford dunked on LeBron at a camp and Nike tried to wipe that footage from existence, from how I remember it  Tim Duncan was a competitive swimmer in his youth, but transitioned to basketball after his local pool got destroyed by a natural disaster (a hurricane, I think?) I feel like that turned out pretty well.  Three NBA MVPs were born on the continent of Africa, but none of them represented an African country in international play:  - Hakeem Olajuwon represented Team USA - Giannis Antetokounmpo represents the Greek national team - and of course, Steve Nash represented Canada."
"Nate Wolters got his career high in blocks in his rookie season (2 blks), another rookie in that 13’-14’ Bucks was a guy called Giannis Antetokounmpo."
"Nikola ""Giannis ""Magic Johnson"" Antetokounmpo"" Jokic"
"Imagine playing Pick n Roll with Jrue/Khris and Giannis Antetokounmpo as the roll man and having good things come out of it. I know it’s almost unimaginable, but we should try."
Giannis Antetokounmpo shouldn't be in the conversation considering he can't get over a screen
"Giannis Antetokounmpo and Anthony Davis will never win a real championship. Don’t bring up the Mickey Mouse championship.   The Brooklyn Nets run the league now. The Brooklyn Nets have Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving.   Nets in 4."
"Real picks: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis   Edgy picks: Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray"
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
The thought of him trying to pronounce “Giannis Antetokounmpo” makes it all worth it though.

That is correct. What has Giannis Antetokounmpo done in the playoffs of real consequence? They both have the same number of series wins against real teams (one). Nobody cares about beating the crippled Magic and Pistons.

"Giannis ""despite the win he was not a sharpshooter"" Antetokounmpo Lol  The day he improves his FT% and 3P% the league is fucked."
"Siakam is much easier to pronounce than Antetokounmpo, unless you're comparing it to Giannis itself"
you'll find you're wrong  &gt; Antetokounmpo became Giannis’ surname after it was spelled that way on his Greek passport instead of his birth name of Adetokunbo.
"It would be one think if they just called him Giannis they same way the say Lebron, Kyrie, etc. The difference is Shaq isn’t willing to take the time to learn how to pronounce Antetokounmpo. If he could actually pronounce antetokounmpo and wanted to refer to him as Giannis, that’d be a different story.  Hell, he already knows Giannis is pronounced with a Y sound not a G. It’s just being lazy and rude not to learn someone’s name that you’re going to be spending well over a decade saying."
[Adedo-Koonbo](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/04/18/giannis-antetokounmpo-name-pronunciation)
" I suspect you were trying to indicate it is not that tricky but are actually showing otherwise with that strange way of breaking into syllables. The t's should be  starting new syllables.   Also there are some subtleties with Greek vs English:  From https://www.si.com/nba/2018/04/18/giannis-antetokounmpo-name-pronunciation#:~:text=While%20the%20more%20popular%20pronunciation,when%20speaking%20to%20him%20directly).  While the more popular pronunciation of the Greak Freak's last name is ""Antay-tu-koompo,"" Ruocco says it is actually pronounced ""Adedo-Koonbo."
 Giannis Antetokounmpo  &gt; An-teto-kum-po  Luka Doncic  &gt; Don-chich  I know this isn't exactly perfect pronunciation but atleast am not slaughtering it. And yes I had to look up Antetokounmpo's spelling but pronunciation is not that hard. They just lazy.
"It's the spelling and people trying to sound it out. People (and analysts) should [read this](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/04/18/giannis-antetokounmpo-name-pronunciation).      &gt; Ruocco says it is actually pronounced ""Adedo-Koonbo.""      If you try and sound out his name you don't get anywhere close to ""Adedo-Koonbo"". Saying ""Adedo-Koonbo"" is not hard."
"Giannis was in a unique situation.  &gt;Although Antetokounmpo and three of his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically receive full Greek citizenship as the Greek nationality law abides by the jus sanguinis. For the first 18 years of his life, Antetokounmpo was effectively stateless, having no papers from Nigeria or Greece.  He didn't become a Greek citizen until 2013."
"If a white person made fun of non western european sounding names, they'd be (rightfully) dragged up and down as being racist.   So yeah, Shaq, stop being dumb, just take a minute to try and learn someone's name. If my wonder bread looking ass can figure out how to pronounce Giannis Antetokounmpo of all names, anyone can do it."
"They'll be on TV, seen from the bench. A rookie who doesn't play is not going to get huge endorsement money.  Very few rookies are good enough to make the rotation of a contending team, and if they are, they are good enough to get a huge contract somewhere else AND endorsement money regardless of where they end up. Kyrie and LeBron had plenty of endorsements in Cleveland.  Do you know who the top 10 endorsement earners in the NBA are?  LeBron, Curry, Durant, Giannis, Westbrook, Zion, Harden, Irving, Lillard, Thompson.  &gt; The attraction of large media markets for free agents is a common point made by talking heads in sports media, as large markets presumably open doors for athletes to earn more endorsement opportunities.  &gt; However, three of the NBA’s top 10 endorsement earners — Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, and Damian Lillard — all currently play in small-to-medium NBA markets. Additionally, Russell Westbrook had spent his career in Oklahoma City, the NBA’s smallest market, prior to joining the Houston Rockets this season.   &gt; While massive media markets may offer an advantage for off-court earning potential, this list shows that on-court success and personal brand building impact player endorsement value far more than the size of their market alone.   https://opendorse.com/blog/nba-top-10-endorsement-earners/  Zion would've got a near max equivalent and huge endorsements no matter where he went, he is not signing a minimum to ring chase as a 20 year old.  The idea that players go to New York or LA and immediately get big endorsements is based on pre-internet logic where you could only watch players on local tv. Knicks are the biggest market and have no players on that list. The only NY/LA players there were already superstars before joining. Giannis is doing just fine."

"Giannis  [led in almost every advanced defensive statistic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gnd7ej/giannis_antetokounmpo_vs_anthony_davis_for_the/) last year.   Regarding voters, you can read Zach Lowe's justification here: [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/29524638/2020-nba-awards-ballot-zach-lowe-picks-mvp-roy-close-races](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29524638/2020-nba-awards-ballot-zach-lowe-picks-mvp-roy-close-races)  &gt;We have so much information now -- including all that fancy tracking data -- you can almost always find one weak spot in a player's defensive dossier if you look hard enough.    &gt;   &gt;Antetokounmpo has no weak spot. He pops up toward the top of damn near every category. He can guard all five positions. He envelopes smaller players, and uses his ridiculous length to bother behemoths. He executes dropback coverages like a veteran center, feinting at drivers and baiting them into shooting before swallowing the ball.   &gt;   &gt;Opponents hit only 41.8% of shots at the rim with Antetokounmpo nearby, by far the lowest figure in the league, per NBA.com.  Read the whole article to understand why he voted him over Gobert and Davis."
"We have determined that being on a printed or digital image with Mr Antetokounmpo converting a successful basketball field goal is detrimental to the brand.  Also, TF are you doing closing out on Giannis."
It's crazy man. People talk more about him than two time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo
"The loser on this trade? Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks, there's no way they are winning a title now."
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"

&gt; (Dennis Shroder has been in extension talks with the Lakers and might be under contract by the time of the expansion. If that happens they'd take him over Antetokounmpo which could really hurt the Lakers chances of signing Giannis in free agency.)  Giannis already signed the extension.
\#allstarszn! It's time. I think the East All-Stars right now should/would be (in no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kyrie Irving * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Kevin Durant * Seth Curry * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Jaylen Brown * Jayson Tatum * Julius Randle
"Basketball Reference has a HOF probability page [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html). Active players are in **bold** in the table.   I can see 3 active players below 30 years old: Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo."
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"

"NBA Finals games and playoff games impress me more than regular season games.  Wardell Stephen Curry II chokes in the NBA Finals and there are better regular season players than him in the league.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving are better than Wardell Stephen Curry II. Two regular season games against the Blazers and Kings doesn’t change anything."

"This rely on the jazz defensive scheme. They guard these players 1v1 Vs Golbert and that something a few teams do. And a guy like AD is great enough to cook Golbert .

Nikola Jokic averaged 24.7 points, 12.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists.   Anthony Davis averaged 24.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.8 blocks.

"I believe this perspective to be skewed because of many league narratives. But in my opinion the 2020 best player in the league was a toss up of Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.  Again though, perspectives are skewed based on league narratives and wins/awards. You can individually look an any of these players though and objectively say they were better than Lebron James under a microscope."

"The guy made a point about how injuries saved the Bucks from being seen as frauds for the third consecutive season and you're out here still mad that the Nets were the (rightful) favourites over the Lakers lol. Yeah no shit ""staying healthy is a part of the game."" The point was that the Nets' comical injuries were the difference between a lot of people considering Giannis Antetokounmpo the best player in the league and him being seen as a fraud once again. People's fandom is totally irrelevant here."
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"

"I didn't know how to phrase it because I'm an idiot. So normally for these honorary games, it happens right after the event, or atleast close to it. But Charles Antetokounmpo passed away in September; Giannis did this in October because that's when the season started. So it was a game in honor of his father, he said so himself, but I didn't think I made the connection clear enough, because a month is a long time and that gap might've made it less significant"
Spelled Giannis and Kevin wrong but managed to spell Antetokounmpo correctly 🤦‍♂️
"I said the exact opposite Lmfao.   The final collission does it but the tear builds up from microtears. Its the same thing for a pectear. You don't just tear these ligaments from a single collission.   Case in point: Giannis Antetokounmpo  Hyperextended his knee, but nothing happened because he clearly didn't build up a lot of microtears over the season. Its the great work of Coach Budenholzer in limiting Giannis's minutes throughout the season."

Russ played at an incredible level individually no doubt but when you look at the seasons before and after his MVP it was really such an anomaly that he won it for leading his team to the league's 10th best record.      |Year|Player|Wins|Conference rank|League Rank| :--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |2019-20|Giannis Antetokounmpo|63|1|1| |2018-19|Giannis Antetokounmpo|60|1|1| |2017-18|James Harden|65|1|1| |2016-17|Russell Westbrook|47|6|10| |2015-16|Stephen Curry|73|1|1| |2014-15|Stephen Curry|67|1|1|
I was Thinking about this the other day in the context of the hornets..the last guy on their bench is a kid named Nate darling an undrafted rookie that failed to crack the rotation…his most memorable contribution was a meme where lebron goads him into shooting a 3 in a game and he air balls it…I only know who he is because he’s the first player from my hometown to make the league..anyways I was thinking that if liangelo ball could contribute just as much to the team as he did (basically nothing) but it keeps their new franchise cornerstone happy because his big brother is around why wouldn’t they get rid of darling and sign liangelo to a contract? …same deal with antetokounmpo and his brother .. he probably doesn’t get extended with the bucks if he’s not giannis’ brother. They probably take a flyer on someone else and hope he turns into a more consistent role player
"Greek lacks hard D and B sounds they lost it during the Koine years (ancients had it but during the Hellenistic era, i.e. post Alexandrian conquests, lost them).  Then they came in contact with Europeans who all had the D and B sounds, so they somehow had to synthesize them (since their original D and B were waaay softer closer to TH and V sounds by this point).  So MP is literally read as B in Greek and NT as D. I know different sounds in reality, however Greek speakers ignore the discrepancy because they actually need the hard D and B sounds on their accent.  So Antetokounmpo when written in Greek Characters is *read* as Adetokunbo which is his real surname. So in a twist of fate Greeks read his surname correctly and non-greeks, Nigerians included, don't. At this point I don't think Giannis cares, IIRC he said that both pronunciations are fine for him. I just find it interesting/funny how those that mangled his surname actually read it correctly and those who are perfectly capable of forming the sound correctly (because their alphabet contains those sounds) ... Don't.  Languages are a fascinating thing, mistakes of that kind when compounded create new languages. It's fascinating to imagine that once all of humanity spoke one language (most possibly were part of one population) , only for it to be so widely shattered and forgotten and morph into exceptionally different sounds, sentiments, vocabularies... All because of compounded ""mistakes"" over the course of millennia upon millennia..."

"""Yeah it's not even a conversation that 2x MVP and 1x Final MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo could be considered better than Kawhi Leonard.  Oh also Giannis is the second player of all time to get MVP and DPOY in the same year.  But yeah no Kawhi sons him he's so much better""  - your head ass"
"True, but Kidd was in charge of telling Giannis he couldn't take jumpers:  &gt; Last April, Kidd told reporters at a morning shootaround in Boston that he had constricted Antetokounmpo to only shooting inside 15 feet, essentially putting training wheels back on the eccentric rising star.   Kidd would also bench Giannis for taking 3s. Not saying Kidd's to blame for everything but there's certainly an argument to be made that he stunted Giannis's jump shot development from a skill that was looking promising to an afterthought. That said, Giannis has getting back on track over the past couple seasons, certainly from the mid range.

"&gt; ""I think it was my second year he told me not to shoot the ball,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Then my third year, at the end of the year, he told me to shoot the ball a little bit. In my fourth year, he let me shoot the ball and in my fifth year he told me, ‘You have the green light, do whatever you want,’ but I wasn’t comfortable enough. It’s hard. When you’re not shooting the ball, it’s hard to get back (to shooting).""  Giannis himself thinks Kidd banning him from shooting had an impact."

Don't buy the stars cancel out theory. Steph up there as well.  **DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo.** I think Gobert (unfairly)  will get docked for being somewhat exposed on the perimeter. I don't think anyone else will genuinely be in the running. I think Jonathan Isaac will be a conversation, but no chance of winning.  **6MOY: Dennis Schroder**, I think Payton Pritchard will start at PG.  **ROTY: Jalen Green**, with Suggs close behind. Cade will get Dwane Casey'd for at least first half of the season.  **MIP: Jonathan Isaac**. Maybe a homer pick, but could be Orlando's leading scorer. He has a lot of offensive game he hasn't really unleashed because he plays like a pastor, and was starting to turn around his mentality before the injury.  **COTY: Billy Donovan**, I think the Bulls are being underrated because none of the names are splashy individually, but when you break it down each player is going into the best fit of his career offensively. Billy Donovan has historically gotten good team defences out of bad individual defenders. IMO they will be a top 3 seed in the East, behind the Bucks and Nets.  **Exec of the Year: Arturas Karnisovas** - see above.  **Champions: Nets (KD)** - Talent."

"LeBron James - Flair  Giannis Antetokounmpo - Triple H  Devin Booker - Randy Orton   Trae Young - Dave Bautista  I wanted to fill all the positions, so I’d say Trae Young is the best upcoming PG who isn’t already a superstar (Luka) same goes for Booker being the best upcoming SG (Paul George, Kyrie aren’t upcoming). Giannis is in the beginning of his prime so I’ll say him as *top of the industry*. Then we have LeBron, the longevity legend. Someone who’s been a top 10 player for almost 20 years. He’ll definitely fill the Ric Flair role."

"Yeah I can definitely see Kelly Oubre averaging 70/15/15 against  Giannis Antetokounmpo to beat the Bucks in 6 games.    With the Bucks having home court advantage too, of course."
"1. LeBron James - I’m not quite ready to move LeBron down yet. I want to see what he does this season and how his health looks. He’s just been so dominant for so long.   2. Kevin Durant - He is just unstoppable. He can score from anywhere and nearly beat the Bucks by himself. He’s just as good as he was before his injury and doesn’t seem to be slowing down.   3. Stephen Curry - He just had an amazing season, maybe the best of his career. It will be interesting to see him this year with Klay back. Obviously a worse defender than Giannis, but he’s just so dominant on offense.   4. Giannis Antetokounmpo - It’s hard having him at 4 after how dominant he was in the Finals, but he’s in the top tier. Just a monster on both ends.   5. Nikola Jokic - There’s a clear drop at this point, in my opinion, but Jokic just had an incredible season and is still young enough to continue improving. He’s also much healthier than guys like Kawhi, Harden, and Embiid."

"There’s a successful team that’s literally built around Gobert.  That being said, ideally you would want an incredible defender with at least passable to great offense, e.g. Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Hakeem Olajuwon, Giannis Antetokounmpo."
"https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/21/22585355/giannis-antetokounmpo-book-excerpt-the-improbable-rise  Kidd was known for playing mind games. He wouldn’t yell; he wouldn’t act overly aggressive. Far from that. He was more delicate, soft-spoken, getting under someone’s skin, knowing the thing that made each player explode. He never gave players answers, wanting them to figure it out on their own.  His coaching style with the Nets, and then with the Bucks, was described as “psychological warfare” by one former player. When asked about Kidd, players and coaches often say, “On the record or off?” Kidd was loved, hated. His coaching style was described as follows:  “Jedi mind tricks,” Oppenheimer says.  “Mind fucks,” says one former teammate, a bit more bluntly.  “Machiavellian,” says a former Bucks staffer. “He kind of relished that combativeness in people.”  But also: “He’s a winner. Naturally a winner. He’s a competitive motherfucker,” says Chris Copeland, .....  “He’d just brutalize people,” says another ex-player. “There’s plenty of teammates that I had that didn’t like him, not even as a coach, like as a person. He’d pit people against each other.”  “I think he may have had rocky relationships with a lot of players,” says Johnny O’Bryant III, Bucks forward from 2014 to 2016. “But one thing he did was he laid the tradition of a winning team. Sometimes the way he went about it, being straightforward, he was just an asshole, but I think it paid off in the long run.”  “I’d never call Jason Kidd an asshole,” says Nicholas Turner, Kidd’s executive assistant from 2014 to 2018, “but he was a player too, so he also has an ego. ... There’s definitely some things that people misunderstand about J-Kidd. Ultimately he wants to win. He has good intentions.”  There was also a cerebral aspect to Kidd. “He was like a professor,” says Jason Terry, Bucks guard from 2016 to 2018, who also played for Kidd in Brooklyn in 2013-14. “Instead of telling you what to do, he engages you, empowers you, by asking, ‘What do you see?’”  “Jason had a brilliant mind,” says Nixon Dorvilien, Bucks assistant trainer from 2014 to 2016, “but he kind of made you uncomfortable around him.”   .......   “When players go through it and it’s uncomfortable, they like to say, ‘He’s playing mind games with me,’ but it’s not that,” says Greg Foster, Bucks assistant coach from 2014 to 2018, now with the Pacers. “He’s trying to get you to do something you wouldn’t normally do. That’s coaching.”  .....  But there was another side to Kidd, one that held players accountable, gave them confidence, raised the level of play. If players were doing the drill wrong, Kidd would grab the ball and hop in the drill and show players how to do it perfectly. Kidd would sometimes dominate and say, “Guys, this isn’t that fucking hard!”  Kidd hated when players were not on time. Or when he had to go over something again. He was a perfectionist—and thought players should get it right the first time. He had this look, this death stare, that was piercing.  His mind was several steps ahead. The things he saw, few could. “It was like being around Einstein,” Oppenheimer says. “Giannis realized that and wanted information, and Jason found a way to feed him information.”  Kidd poured hours into helping Giannis but was less sympathetic with other players. “I don’t think he could identify with the average player,” says another ex-player. “There’s a reason Hall of Famers are Hall of Famers, especially point guards"
"This book excerpt isn't new for the most part.   The Ringer had most of it weeks ago.  https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/21/22585355/giannis-antetokounmpo-book-excerpt-the-improbable-rise  It's a bit more balanced as you see both the positives and negatives. You get to see why Kidd may be hated, but also the other side of Kidd.  This twitter piece is selective, one-sided by comparision"
"Even so, this article from January 2018 says that Giannis said “I’m loyal to the people I work with. I love him as a person. I care about him as a person.” Just cause you guys won more games wouldn’t make you say that right? Not trying to say Kidd isn’t a bad dude or that Giannis is, just trying to understand this.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/giannis-antetokounmpo-says-jason-kidd-helped-him-grow-dominant-player%3famp=1"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo is not currently available for a trade and he has also not requested one from the Milwaukee Bucks, sources tell Zach Lowe of ESPN.  A trade of Giannis, if it does happen during the 21-22 season, is widely expected to come down to the Philadelphia 76ers, New York, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Houston, Cleveland, Brooklyn, Utah, Sacramento, Toronto, Dallas, Mexico City, Tokyo, Milwaukee, Charlotte, Chicago, Golden State, Washington, Orlando, Miami, Oklahoma City, and Boston"
"Dude that's laughable.   Straight from Giannis   ""He was a big part of my success,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""He trusted me, he put the ball in my hands, he motivated me on a daily basis, he pushed me to be great and not to be mediocre.  ""I was 19 when he came and he said he was going to put the ball in my hands. The first time I wasn't ready. I told him, 'Coach, I'm not ready to create and make plays for the team.' He said, 'OK, we're going to take our time.' The next year, he put the ball in my hands and I was ready.  ""But coming from a guy like Jason Kidd is big. He's going to end up—whatever, if he got fired or not—he's going to end up in the Hall of Fame. Having Jason Kidd as our coach was big."""
"Is the author of the tweets legit? His twitter handle's ***Fake***TJHawke and his cover pic's an edited tweet from Showtime. Also, Giannis was heavily against firing Kidd    https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2755420-report-giannis-antetokounmpo-devastated-after-bucks-fire-jason-kidd"
"It was both  https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30521245/everything-fuel-giannis-antetokounmpo-competitive-fire  &gt;Antetokounmpo added a wrinkle to the routine. If he missed his free throws, his coaches would need to run and he would need to watch.

He invited Riddlesprigger and their 10-month-old son, Liam, to the gym. Now, Antetokounmpo had to hit his free throws or go through the torture of watching Riddlesprigger run with Liam. It was an airtight plan to boost accountability and focus."

"Giannis Antetokounmpo has been knocked ad nauseam because of his lack of three point shooting. If he won MVP wven as near as 2005, noone would care. Heck, they probably wouldn't even mind surrounding him with non-shooters which for a player with a skillset like Akumpo, sounds ludacris today."

Now Giannis has the 2nd and 3rd best, but not even close to Kyrie and Harden. KD loses but his the best player because he scored points?  He used to do that in OKC... Why is he suddenly the best player now???  I mean he joined a 73 win team that beat him... Then left that team to prove he can win without a super duper team... But then he ended up building another super duper team anyways... When he lost Kyrie and Harden that was his chance to prove to the world that he can win without a super stacked super duper team...  But then what happened? He still loses to what the majority were calling during the playoffs as the ""dumbest"" team that could win it all.  So then he scored 49 points but all of a sudden his the greatest player in basketball....  LoL! His still the same loser who cant get over the hump unless he stacked the deck on his favor.

It's not like he's a ""hater"" or a doomsayer:  &gt; Here’s the thing, though. The NBA is sort of back. These playoffs have been gloriously entertaining. That Bucks-Nets Game 7 should run on ESPN Classic. Trae Young might just be the charismatic superstar of the future. Giannis Antetokounmpo could be on his Hero’s Journey. The Suns are an aesthetically pleasing contender and the Kawhi Leonard-less Clippers are a captivating underdog. It’s been a good postseason.

"You don't have to like it but to say that there is ""absolutely 0 strategy"" and that 70s and 80s teams would ""demolish"" modern-day teams is your opinion - one that most likely will remain unquantifiable. But it really shows that you A) don't appreciate basketball and, B) miss ""the good ol' days of basketball."" I, like you, grew up watching 80s basketball and frankly even the Lakers and Celtics don't live up to the hype of their legendary conflicts - they played some really bad games every now and then. Don't get me started on how bad most of the 80s teams were. Bad games are part of any sport where you have to huck a rubber ball through a metal ring with other people trying to stop you.  I like professional wrestling and I'm familiar with modern-day performers, their schticks, and the type of wrestling that is popular today. Most pro-wrestling in the U.S. and Mexico is not my bag - so I choose not to watch it. However, I have taken the time to try and understand the modern-day version of pro-wrestling and after a sufficient period of time, decided it isn't my cup of sizzle.   I'd encourage you and your dad to give it another try but with an open mind. The Bucks haven't won a championship since 1971. The Suns have never won a championship. Chris Paul is probably a top 2 or 3 point guard all-time with one of the finest basketball minds I've ever seen. Deandre Ayton has literally improved before our eyes this season. And Giannis Antetokounmpo is a man with an amazing personal story of overcoming hardship, devoting himself to learning the game, and rather than chase a winning situation somewhere else last offseason, signed with the team that drafted him and is now one game from winning an NBA championship. I'll take this over most of what I saw in the 80s and 90s."

Prior to his flagrant foul and ejection, Antetokounmpo witnessed what few noticed during the course of the game. For reasons unknown, Dunleavy Jr. zeroed in on Michael Carter-Williams as a player to pick on during his team's Game 6 matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks.  Dunleavy Jr. hit Carter-Williams above the shoulders and targeted his neck on multiple plays in the first quarter. The initial strike came when Carter-Williams drove the lane and jumped into traffic. Instead of simply contesting the shot, Dunleavy Jr. moved over in help defense and finished the play with a blow to Carter-Williams' neck. Look closely and you'll see Carter-Williams point to his neck and complain to officials about what should have been ruled a flagrant foul.   Dunleavy Jr. followed with another shot when he set a screen on Carter-Williams, who took things in his own hands after officials failed to heed his complaints.   Because the score became so lopsided as the game progressed, the young Bucks no longer had anything to lose. Chicago defeated Milwaukee 120–66, the fourth-largest victory in NBA history. They held a 58–28 lead when Antetokounmpo leveled Dunleavy Jr. just before halftime.”"
GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO IS AN ANGRY ANGRY MAN AND HE WANTS THAT TROPHY
"HOLY FUCK dude I think we just figured out how the Bucks had an outbreak.   CP3 saved some of his saliva from when he had Covid in a vial and dumped it in a water bottle labeled ""Antetokounmpo"" in game 1. Little did he know, he accidentally dumped it in Giannis' brothers bottle causing him to get it.   Thanasis then gave it to the assistant coach because they are secretly lovers.   You are the Watson to my Sherlock."
"I remember a couple of years ago he was asked something to the effect of why doesn't he train with players on other teams in the off-season. He said something like why would he train with them when they're his opponents.   &gt;He told The Athletic: ‘I can’t work out with you in the summer and then play you in a few months. It feels weird. It doesn’t feel right with me. Like other players, it’s cool for other players, but I don’t. I don’t want to. Other guys do it. ‘I feel like with LeBron and KD [Kevin Durant], KD did that to LeBron. Take a lot of his thoughts and use it against him. And that’s what I don’t want guys doing to me.’  [Source](https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/25/nba-mvp-giannis-antetokounmpo-lebron-james-kawhi-leonard-summer-training-10055101/)  I think he just has a killer mentality, which I love. But because he doesn't train with them he doesn't build the same relationships. Like most of those guys grew up playing AAU ball together. Giannis didn't and he's also not into training, so he really isn't making friends.   I absolutely love his way of thinking. If other players don't give him props and go to his games then it's whatever. It doesn't seem to phase him."
#GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO FROM DOWNTOWN!
"&gt; kd is probably an inch or two taller  I thought that myth was laid to rest when KD was actually measured by the Nets to be 6'10"".  I.e. tall for a wing, but kind of undersized for a C.  Giannis has at least an inch on him:  [for example](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/giannis-antetokounmpo-of-the-milwaukee-bucks-talks-with-kevin-durant-picture-id1232700466?s=2048x2048)  What's definitely can't be the case btw is Giannis being the same weight as in 2018 (when he was last measured). 2018 was the tail end of his scrawny phase, he was still quite thin and his measurement was 242 . Then in 2019 he showed up quite buffer, same measurement though because they do not reweigh players often. And he has kept the same ""weight"" ever since. Current Giannis is at least 15 pounds over his 2018 iteration, 20 pounds more likely.  I would put him somewhere between 257-262 and yeah, he is quite bigger than KD too which is easily visible while on court."

"&gt; How is assists to turnovers cherry picking? Those are literally the only stats that people use for playmaking that are available.  Read my other response to you:  &gt;Booker played the 1, and plays the 1/primary ball handler. He was doing this when they had literally no point guard, pre-Rubio. Cherry picking per36/topg stats doesn't tell the whole story because his usage rates have always been +/-10% if not more than Middleton's his whole career.  If he's passing it to dudes who can't finish in the paint, or can't even catch the ball (don't make me list off all the shit centers and power forwards that the Suns have had during his career) Obviously his turnover rate is going to be a lot higher. Running P&amp;R with Giannis Antetokounmpo apparently really helps your advanced stats.  Forgot the eye test doesn't matter on r/nba , my bad.

"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot—and Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee’s impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven’t won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship résumés, seeing all these new faces on the league’s biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul—these Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we’re getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography—elevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it’s a “down” year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he’s not among the NBA’s peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he’s only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he’s playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis’s signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday’s game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it’s astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis’s blunt power—these stars may be dissimilar, but that’s why they’re such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it’s tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee’s, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on “Booker game” everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points—though playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee’s Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they’re now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn’t see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There’s no asterisk to this title. There’s been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I’d take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the “bubble tournament” in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the “bubble title,” or this one. Come on. Don’t be absurd.   I have no idea what’s going to happen here, and that’s great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday—thanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I’ll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim—it’s hard to get a read on where it’s going. Phoenix’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don’t, and that’s the exciting thing. There’s nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there’s none here. We truly don’t know for sure who’s going to win it, and that’s the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He’s really something else."
Middleton looked over his left shoulder and saw Giannis bathing in a tub full of tzatziki. Middleton slowed his walk about reached out his left hand. Antetokounmpo slapped it for a quick high-five before pulling him into a the tub for a saucy cucumber hug.

(The Bucks got approximately an extra 12 points from non-heave 3's relative to the current postseason percentage.)  At best, the two transgressions even out in a series that is otherwise Suns 2-1 without Refball (aka neither team has been screwed out of a win)."

We have a lot of family back home. “We know where we are going to stay. We know what we are going to do. It’s going to be family. Let’s go do it. So I’m happy.” Giannis in October 2019 revealed that he has gotten his Nigerian passport and that understands little Igbo, the language of the Igbo tribe in Nigeria where his mother comes from.”"

"Here's what he said in response to a specific question regarding FT differential. That's about the harshest I've ever seen him go after officiating, calling it ""frustrating"".  &gt;On Wednesday, Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer was asked about the free-throw attempt difference, and he provided this response, per ESPN's [Tim Bontemps]  &gt;""You trying to bait me?"" Budenholzer said as he smiled.   &gt;""No, I mean, it's a huge part of the game. They had 25 points from the free throw line. We're a team that prides ourselves in defending and being able to be good defensively without fouling.  &gt;""I can't remember the last time a team got 25 free throws in a game against the Bucks. And then conversely, the way Giannis [Antetokounmpo] attacks, the way Khris [Middleton] attacks, as many opportunities as Khris has with the ball...it's frustrating, but it's part of the sport. It's part of the game.  &gt;""We've got to be better defensively. We've got to keep them off the free throw line and we got to be more aggressive attacking and getting to the free throw line and getting to good offense."""
My sun and my stars Giannis Antetokounmpo
Antetokounmpo sounds very much Nigerian.  The firstname Giannis does not.  Giannis is the Greek name.  Giannis Antetokounmpo was given his Greek passport only a short time before the NBA draft that year.
Shaq does this same shit on TNT all the time and it's super annoying. Fine I can't pronounce Antetokounmpo either so I don't try. I can say Giannis so I just use that.
Same I can't say Antetokounmpo to save my life so he's just Giannis.
"You think with Giannis Antetokounmpo (Guess what, Giannis is Nigerian too SAS) being a multi-year MVP, DPOY, All-NBA talent, the name of the people they played against wouldn't matter.      Why is he pointing at the player's names ?"
3. Greek Freak  2. Antetokounmpo  1. Giannis
"We're talking about *currently*, not a few years ago.  He doesn't even crack the top 10.  Most recent rankings:  1. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets  2. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  3.

Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  9. Steven Adams, New Orleans Pelicans  10. Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics  He's behind *Jaylen fucking Brown*."
"This is how I feel about NBA guys who still mispronounce Giannis Antetokounmpo. It’s your job, he’s literally an MVP. Figure it out."
" Antetokounmpo is 11-of-25 (44%) when guarded by Deandre Ayton.   Against everyone else, Giannis is 25-of-32 (78.1%)."
Why would it not be Giannis? Every player goes by their first names. And it’s way easier and simpler to just say Giannis than saying Antetokounmpo.
Yes. Giannis Antetokounmpo!

"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7.

Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."
&gt;Giannis Antetokounmpo says he's 'not Michael Jordan'  I want the men who were comparing Giannis to Jordan brought before me and hanged at dawn
"IMO there have been at least 13 PFs that were capable of winning a scoring title at some point in their career, but for various reasons they didn't:  Tim Duncan  Karl Malone  Kevin Garnett  Dirk Nowitzki  Kevin McHale  Charles Barkley  Anthony Davis  Chris Webber  Blake Griffin  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Amar'e Stoudemire  Spencer Haywood  Tom Chambers"
"I knew we were losing this game, the Bucks are very good and it was must win for them. It shocked me that we started off that good with Booker in his worst night of the year (I am extremely afraid he might be injured given Monty also pulled him in game 2 just so he doesn't play a fucking 1 extra minute, but it might be me making excuses for my favorite player), but the Bucks made their runs in the spots they had to, had some positive variance, and took a huge momentum boost of a win.  I do not think the Bucks got the Suns ""figured out"". The Suns go as far as their best player, Devin Booker, takes them, and he took them nowhere last night. I am still confident we can get game 4. This to me is a ""good for them"" game, like game 3 vs the Clippers was. The big difference is Giannis Sina-Ugo Antetokounmpo. He's too good, too big, too fast, too strong, AND for the first time in his playoff career, he gets the 50-50 calls instead of being screwed for being too big. Unfortunate (and curious) timing for it to happen.  Monty is a great pre-planner. So he just needs to figure things out. I think he thought Bud would play the shot-quality game and go with the game 2 game plan, but with the way they limited corner three attempts we went with plan B, which is more Ayton and more above the break threes to get that shot gravity back. Other than Crowder, everyone missed everything. We were still great from midrange, but that's just what we do. Jrue ""50% true shooting"" Holiday hitting 5/10 threes sucks, but good for him for responding after all the shit he's gotten this playoff run.  If there's one huge non-Giannis problem, is the offensive boards. Bucks are great at them. Other than that, I remain convinced that we can win this series, especially since Bud is allergic to playing Brook Lopez big minutes.   Shout out to my guy Cam Johnson. If Book isn't injured and he just played like shit, then it's time to bounce the fuck back, split the away games and come in to a roaring PHX Suns Arena."

Luka creates more point per possession than Trae this year. And the Ast/TOs ratio is not all that define a playmaker and it is not too far by the two!  Last year when Trae had better stats was worst than Luka as overall creation so I assume this year is the same. That's the article about that: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james  From last year I think Harden and Jokic have improved in playmaking and also Steph would be in the mix. Last year Trea was 5th by Points created so this year he should be top 7 as I said.

"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from a week ago so even if he's eclipsed some of these players since then, the point still stands."

"That's a lot of words for barely anything said. The question is why people are skeptical of the Jazz and Suns come playoff time. The answer has nothing to do with market size.  If the Jazz or Suns had Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, or Steph Curry, they'd be taken more seriously and they wouldn't even have to relocate! Sometimes it's that simple.  The NBA is a superstar-driven league where the champion *almost always* has a widely-considered-to-be top 5/10 talent, if not several. Many strong regular season teams have folded in the face of a superstar in the playoffs, and some people here have watched long enough to learn from this. The exceptions exist, but are rare."

"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"Russell Westbrook: 182 triple doubles, more than Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Bob Pettit, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Steph Curry, Allen Iverson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Derrick Rose, Bill Russell, Gary Payton and Kawhi Leonard COMBINED (181)"
"Top 5 I can kind of see it, however consistent top 2, top 3 that I see all over the place I can't.  The reason that the Warriors KD was better than Curry was because he could give the team one thing they'd sorely miss. I.e. rim protection on small ball squads, high caliber defense if needed but also couple with one of the best scoring options the league has seen.  And yes Curry may be better than even *that* (scoring wise), however he would not stop a run in the way that a contested KD rebound and a block of his (in the very next possession) would. KD could turn on a switch and become (in defense) great from merely passable.  Curry would never have that switch and the margins are low in the playoffs, if you lack the one thing that is needed at the time it is needed it is lethal.  As for Kawhi. He landed on the tail end of a dynasty, I can give you that. However when he joined the Raptors they were far from a powerhouse , they were called a fake 1 seed in the year before and he outplayed both a Sixers team that was actually more loaded than this year (same big 3 as now + f@cking Jimmy) *and* a hungry Bucks who looked unstoppable at that point (were 10-1 before being gentleman swept by the Kawhi led Raps). He did carry and showed up where the rest of the team couldn't (Nurse's system was ""if all else fails dump the ball to Kawhi"").  So yes, *that* title run was way harder than any of Steph's. And yes those Warriors were kind of falling apart at the time, however Kawhi ran over quite capable competition before even reaching them.  So yeah, we have ample evidence that at least 3 players are better, because they had the edge in harder situations. Then you add Harden (in 2019) who was leading literal g leaguers (no different than how Steph is doing this year) but in 4th seed instead of 8th and you can have a very good case for him as well (and of course him almost toppling a full strength Warriors in the year before, but truth remains that he failed so it can go either way).  And of course the curious case of Antetokounmpo. He plays like the ideal small ball 5 , yet his coach never plays him that position and ofc he is stopped because they play some kind of basketball that time has forgotten. So him too, *may* be proven better once he gets himself a coach.   Which btw is exactly where I would put Curry, somewhere between 4th and 6th (what I call tier 2). Which IMO is a very reasonable ranking, and in fact this season further proves that the is a top player but not *absolute* top player. What I like to call his tier is ""flawed superstar"" (and I include him, Harden and Giannis, w either of the other two having a chance to be better if they had as favorable circumstance as Curry's, played in better situations)...  Yet you rarely see him there, i.e. w players that are excellent and prolly would do as much as him if they ever had the same help. Instead you always see him a tier above , among players that actually *did* better, sometimes w less (Kawhi's title run of 2019 was legendary, Bron in 2016 and KD being -in fact- the better player of the Warriors titles)"
"One of the most efficient high-volume scorers in league history. Here’s a list of every player with multiple seasons of TS% of .62+, usage of 25+ and 1,000+ MP, and how many times they did it:    Kevin Durant — 7   Steph Curry — 6   Adrian Dantley — 5   LeBron James — 3   Giannis Antetokounmpo — 2   Charles Barkley — 2   Amare Stoudemire — 2   Karl-Anthony Towns — 2    That’s the list. In addition to that, there’s only 11 other guys with 1 such season.    Dantley was an amazing individual scorer. Pretty selfish player though, and a lot guys reportedly didn’t like playing with or coaching him. Probably the standard bearer of empty scorers."
"Eh tbf, Andre Drummond is not that big of a name.  Giannis Antetokounmpo, now that's a big name."
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
MVP  1. Chris Paul  2. Nikola Jokic  3. Joel Embiid  4. Julius Randle  5. Giannis Antetokounmpo
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
"Giannis ""Mark Henry"" Antetokounmpo"
"Giannis ""Randy Watson"" Antetokounmpo"
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."

"Probably because nobody gives a fuck about wins against mediocre first round opponents. It's similar to how nobody should give a shit about Giannis Antetokounmpo dominating the corpses of the sub.-500 Pistons and Magic. The fact of the matter is that every second Simmons spends in the dunker's spot against quality opponents (e.g. the 2019 semifinals) is a cancer to their offence, especially since they have no other high level ball handlers."

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokic   *chef's kiss*
"This actually happened 46 seconds after the game started, but nobody has made a thread about it bizarrely.  &gt; I am not a doctor and there is nothing I can gain from pretending to be one in this situation.   &gt; Antetokounmpo tried a eurostep and his right foot landed on top of Olynyk's. Giannis let out a yell and crumbled to the floor. He got up and shot free throws.  https://twitter.com/eric_nehm/status/1387933594245545984"
"I don't think you're arguing these guys are trash, I think the basis you're using to evaluate these players isn't consistent or even. You're basically saying these guys look worse in hindsight, which I vehemently disagree with. Stats didn't come by as easily back then for a variety of reasons, but it really wasn't that much less skilled just a decade ago.  Kobe had knee injuries, had a procedure, and was healthy in 2012-2013. Saying it wasn't sustainable is, again, ignoring the context of the fact he hurt his knee twice in the same game that he injured his achilles. Then he tore his rotator cuff. Then he had another knee injury. He dropped off due to these injuries that just piled up on him, but in 2012 itself, when healthy, he is not being displaced by these guys.   I do agree they were better than Dwight because of their offenses, but they weren't the terror Dwight was defensively and that's while acknowledging them both as absolute amazing defenders. Dwight was much, much better as an overall anchor than both and he was much better than Gobert because he was far more athletic too. I never said Dwight was anything offensively, but his insane athleticism is what gives him an edge and if he actually bought in on pick and rolls, which he never really did, he would have been more offensively.   The players you listed are not better than Rondo, Aldridge, Parker, etc. Place those same players in this era and their numbers are spiking heavily. Rondo would likely average 15 assists and a triple double himself like Westbrook, he was insanely good back then opposed to just a primetime player that he turned into. Parker played on the Spurs, but the Spurs only reinvented their offense when it got stagnant. The entire Spurs system is about sarcifice, Manu/Parker/Duncan all sacrificed in order to consistently win. That same core would still beat out the majority of teams these guys are on today, so how you're rating them low is just questionable to me because they would probably be the second or third best team in the league only clearly behind the Nets and that's because of the talent of their big three.  Chris Bosh only made one all nba team because in his Raptor years he was going up against prime Duncan, Pau, KG, Dirk, and Amare and once he got to the Heat he heavily sacrificed the offensive side of his games as the third star.  ""Harden/Curry/Davis/Antetokounmpo/Leonard/Doncic/Jokic/Embiid"" -&gt;these players? For sure. The stars that come after that such as Lillard, Beal, etc that often have giant holes in their own games(for those two it's defense, for George it's consistency and durability, etc).  Kemba- giant defensive liability  Zion - giant defensive liability(that being said, he's clearly a generational talent and his offense will eventually start making up for it).  Tatum - weaknesses in playmaking. He's becoming more efficient, but his playmaking and actual team play is lacking and there's a reason the Jays barely have the Celtics above .500 this year and it's because once their playmakers go down it's hard for them to carry that load.  I feel Butler is often underrated, so I won't disrespect him, but he will be one of the players that are similarly disrespected in the future with similar things about what youre saying in regards to Bosh now. His impact doesn't translate as well to stats, but it's immeasurable in action and he raises the floor and ceilings of the teams he's on.  Gobert is great, but I don't think he compares well with the defensive bigs that were strong in the past. I'm taking Marc, prime Dwight, Chandler(2011 version at least), and Duncan over him.  As far as you say they'd be shoo-ins for third team spot or better in those years: no, they wouldn't. You can't just take their current year, drop them in 201x year and say ""they'll put up the exact same numbers"". We have out of prime players now putting up better numbers than they were a few years ago in their primes because again the rule changes and how they call defense are getting easier for offenses. Defending is also harder now than it was, but that doesn't mean players are defending better; there's literally less effort defensively in the regular season than there has been in the past due to the strain and effort required to defend compared to the past. There's a reason Giannis goes from an unstoppable freak in the regular season to those fast breaks drying up fast and hard in the post-season and this applies across the board.   All in all, what I'm saying is cross-era comparisons are stupid."

"Kawhi Leonard is tough because I know he has Defensive Player of the Year Awards, but he's not somebody that anybody saw being a superstar right away, even his first Finals MVP you can make a case that could have gone to two other people on his team ( I myself would have given it to Duncan), and I don't think he truly became a great, franchise-changing player until the 2015/16 season, I think he's just barely passed 10,000 points now, he led an all-time great playoff run which had people calling him the best player in the NBA, a status he lost the very next postseason by blowing a 3-1 lead and choking in game 7, and even though he's chilled out on some of the load management this year I don't think he's ever going to be in position to win an MVP so his legacy is going to be built on all NBA teams and winning , so I could see him being on anybody's list anywhere in between 25-40 all time              I understand Andre Iguodala was a very valuable piece to the Warriors Dynasty and even to Miami getting the finals last year, and even though Max Kellerman turned him into some kind of a meme he does seem to be unusually clutch, but the conversation around Andre Iguodala reminds me of the one that's also being had about Julian Edelman in the NFL, grade intangibles in the playoffs and even though I don't think Andre Iguodala deserved his Finals MVP he has it, not a Hall of Famer              In the case of Giannis Antetokounmpo, top 10 power forward already, I'm comfortable saying that I just don't know where to rank him right now, he's been in the league longer than I thought, he has to get it together in the playoffs, I'm curious as to how he does this playoffs"

Last time giannis played em they won by 33 and he had a triple double. Also the last actual game between the two teams giannis didnt play and the bucks only lost by 6 and the wrong antetokounmpo dropped 23/10/5. All of that makes me very hesitant to compare em to last years heat team like others are trying to do in the comments.
"&gt;**Jokic finished with 964 points and was the only player named on all 101 ballots.** Embiid (82) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (81) were the only others named on more than 70.  &gt;Since the league shifted to its current voting format before the 2016-17 season, **no MVP winner has finished more than 224 points ahead of second** (when James Harden outpaced James in 2018). Jokic, by comparison, has a 568-point advantage over Embiid, who is now a very distant second."

I didn't say players don't take PEDs I said reddit assumes way more players are taking PEDs than actually are. Reddit tends to think every athlete is juicing. You would probably argue that 90% of the league is on some sort of performance enhancing substance.   I played football in college (one of the sports that gets even more accusations of PED use). Yes players are on PEDs (I definitely had teamates that were). Yes some teams trainers have the whole team on PEDs (Had friends that went to different schools were the trainer gave them some questionable pills they didn't ask about). Even with all of that I'd still say only 30-50% of players are juicing. A lot of y'all really just say anyone who's athletic is on PEDs.   Giannis doesn't even have like a super unachievable body type he's like 6'11 245 and looks pretty lean https://i80sportsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/giannis-antetokounmpo-shirtless.jpg . I realize not everyone who's taking something isn't going to be ripped but I really don't see an argument for him being on drugs.
"Giannis is literally having the best series in his career, against a good opponent. 30/13/3 on 57% TS?   He never done that. That's what Giannis will give you, if you can't win with that you are not going anywhere. There are maybe 10 or less people who can give you that offensively in the whole league.  Now defensively? Goddamn is that kid underutilized. A DPoY should alter results and he altered jack shit standing in the corner ""guarding"" Harris.  If they are to win this series they need DPoY Antetokounmpo. Not holding his d*ck in the corner Antetokounmpo.  Those thinking that a 30/13/3 series on good efficiency is Giannis wetting the bed need to get out more ... They should look more widely into the league.  There is nothing deceiving about his statline. They were up 19 during the 3rd due to his efforts, they should have won the game..."

And why do you want a player who was a negative on a bad team?  &gt; would be a 2x better fit that Schroder, who can’t shoot or pass.  Schroder was 23rd in the league in assists, and averaged more per-game than any secondary ballhandlers except: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and 2 of \[ Sabonis, Brogdon, and McConnell \].

Steph Curry/Bradley Beal/LeBron James/Giannis Antetokounmpo/Anthony Davis
"&gt;They traded for him because the Laker really needed a secondary playmaker when Bron was on the bench and he was coming off as a top 6moy candidate.  Which is precisely what Schroder gave them.  The only secondary ballhandlers who averaged more than his 5.8 assists per game: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two of \[ Sabonis, McConnell, Brogdon \].  Schroder was also 23rd in the league in assists.  &gt;so yeah starting caruso  Did you see what happened when Caruso did start?  It was brutal.  Caruso was -7.2/100 as a starter, and +6.6/100 as a reserve.  I like Caruso a ton, but he is not, and probably never will be, a starter-caliber NBA point guard.  &gt;but demanding a starting role isn't the best thing for team chemistry.  Neither is refusing to play center.  At least in Schroder's case his demand was clearly the best option for the team -- and really not in any sort of doubt, anyway.  There was practically no other option but to start to Schroder.  His demand was about as meaningful as if Davis had demanded to start.  That said, ""demand"" is strong for his [actual quotes on the matter.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30424042/dennis-schroder-says-intends-start-point-guard-los-angeles-lakers)"
"Just going to throw out this datapoint.  Secondary ball-handlers in the NBA who averaged more than Schroder's 5.8 assists per game this season: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two of \[ Domantas Sabonis, TJ McConnell, Malcolm Brogdon \].  That's it.  He was also 23rd in assists, in the entire league.  And he did that playing for a coach with basically no offensive ideas beyond ""Give James the ball and watch"", ""Give Davis the ball and watch"", and ""Give Schroder the ball and watch"".  Actually, a few other stats, while I'm here.  Schroder led the Lakers in assist/turnover ratio.  He also had the 3rd-highest offensive rating, behind only James and Davis.  Sure, it'd be nice if he could shoot better, but the skills he has are not cheaply-obtained in the NBA.  &gt;I think Schroder could end up getting a 4 year, 65 million dollar contract  I will be shocked if he signs for less than $20M/year.  &gt;Do you think he will re-sign with the Lakers, or join some other team and take on a bigger role?  The Lakers cannot replace him, so it makes no sense for them not to match any offer."

"Statmuse lets you do X player vs Y player and it'll give you the stats for games where they both played - eg.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/giannis-antetokounmpo-stats-vs-bam-this-season  If you want actual matchup data based on tracking, you want NBA.com stats, specifically the matchup tab. Difference between the two is Giannis played 96 mins across 3 games vs Bam, but Bam only guarded Giannis for 13 of those mins. Statmuse can do the 96 mins, but you'll need NBA.com for the 13 min specifically. eg.  https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203507/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense"
"interesting...  I think your second round seems right to me, but that means:  \- Suns have LeBron and Jokic  \- Clippers have Luka and I think Gobert (over Ja)  \- Sixers have Beal and Trae (over Randle)  \- Nets have Tatum and Giannis  I say the Suns and Nets win. So my WCF champ would be the suns:  C Nikola Jokic  PF LeBron James  SF Kawhi Leonard  SG Devin Booker  PG Chris Paul  vs the ECF Champ, the Nets  C Joel Embiid  PF Giannis Antetokounmpo  SF Kevin Durant  SG James Harden  PG Kyrie Irving  6th man: Jayson Tatum  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Suns actually win with their playmaking, but thats a clash of the titans - especially with the the front court scoring and back court defense of the Nets."
"Personally, I don't understand why Giannis ""LONGBOYE"" Antetokounmpo doesn't just dunk as soon as soon as he gets the ball inbound?"
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."
"Looking at [the play](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=135&amp;GameID=0042000213&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Antetokounmpo%20Palming%20Turnover%20(P2.T3)&amp;sct=plot) again, his problem may have been that he did it twice, I see guys get away with that hesitation dribble all the time, you're right, but Giannis did it twice in a row."

You mean Giannis “Ben Simmons at the FT line” Antetokounmpo?
"A lot of my extended family live in Greece, and the whole country has been on the edge of their seats this postseason. Apparently the local broadcast is regularly cutting to an in-arena suite where the Antetokounmpo family is sitting. After Giannis got dunked on, his mom leaned over the glass and began waving a white flag. As they zoomed in to show the rest of the family trying to stop her, you could see Kostas heading for the door with metal kebab skewers in his hands."
"Lmaooo I saw someone say Giannis will poster the shit out of Blake in that step over Thanasis thread and it was the most upvoted comment. The reverse just happened, Blake has officially murdered the Antetokounmpo family."

"I can't believe this guy got paid more than Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bradley Beal, Jrue Holiday, Julius Randle, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown this season."
"Yeah but you forget it’s not a global league, it has teams from two Anglophone American countries.  I think less than 30% of Americans can name (in a rudimentary fashion) at least 3 amendments in the bill of rights, let alone understand Slavic naming conventions.  I can respect Tingus Pingus as a basketball player and I can hate Slobodan Milosevic as a politician and I can simultaneously think both of their names sound funny.  Giannis Antetokounmpo is completely deserving of his 2 MVPs and although I can pronounce his name, I don’t shit on people who can’t. Or Jokić, or Vusević.   If you’re a journalist yeah, learn their name. Dumbass. But as a layman, as somebody who knows a lil about Slavic history and culture, who has seen names like this a lot — they still sound funny. Language is weird, hell the word flange or sprocket sounds funny to me.  And lastly, if it’s racist it’s one thing, like “oh those Slavs names sound ugly.” But no, it’s just a humorous collection of sounds, and he’s an NBA player making minimum 10x what I do, so I can’t really bully him.  And the reason it’s funny isn’t because it’s like Mike Smith Jr., that’s not his analogous name, it’s Michael Michaelson.  Which while perfectly acceptable and the norm in Slavic naming is sorta ridiculous at this time in Anglophone countries. I thought the kid in my class named Jerry Geraldson had just as funny a name."
Oh yeah... that’s the series the league figured out how to try and guard Giannis Antetokounmpo.
"&gt;Late that Monday evening, just minutes after the agreement was struck, word reached the news media of Milwaukee and Sacramento's intended sign-and-trade. And during the board of governors' call on Tuesday, **several league sources indicated that Bucks governor Marc Lasry stopped just short of bragging about Milwaukee's impressive Monday evening of transactions**. However, multiple league personnel participating on the call said they did not remember any Bucks official gloating or any noted behavior or conversation out of the ordinary.   &gt;Either way, **at least one rival team filed a formal complaint to the league office Wednesday, sources said**. And by that afternoon, the league informed both Milwaukee and Sacramento that it would open an investigation into an alleged sign-and-trade already being agreed to four days before free agency had begun. The league also sent a memo to all 30 teams that afternoon reminding franchises of the NBA's anti-tampering policies, encouraging teams not to ""jump the gun"" in contacting players under contract with other teams and warning punishments of up to $10 million and draft-pick forfeiture.    https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2919681-inside-the-botched-sign-and-trade-that-could-send-giannis-antetokounmpo-packing  So this formal complaint just happened to pop up out of nowhere after this board of governors call eh? Funny how easily y'all blame Silver for something your FO fucked up. You guys even held a vendetta against Woj lmao"

"For the folks contributing to the Schroder slander below, a few points:  * Schroder led the Lakers in A/TO ratio * Schroder had the third-highest offensive rating on the team, behind James and Davis * Among Lakers with 60+ GP, Schroder had the second-highest net rating behind only his most-frequent teammate, Caldwell-Pope * As noted elsewhere, among non-primary ball-handlers in the NBA, only Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two Pacers\* averaged more assists per game than Schroder's 5.8 * Schroder was 26th in the league in APG.  The only veteran among the 25 ahead of him who had a lower salary was TJ McConnell.  In fact, the only other ones even close to Schroder's $16M were Ricky Rubio at $17M and Fred VanVleet at $21M.  If you don't like Schroder's attitude, or off-court behavior, or whatever, then fine.  But if you are going to argue against his play, educate yourself first.  He was a fairly incredible bargain this past season.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Indiana's trio of McConnell, Sabonis, and Brogdon all averaged about 6.5 assists"

"**1)** WINNING (Part 1): The Celtics were ho-hum right before Russell joined the team, pretty bad right after he retired, and even worse when he missed games during his career, but when he was there they were the most dominant title-winning franchise in sports history, which proves how ludicrous the “He was simply the best player on a loaded team” comment is. DETAILS: a) Boston won 2 total playoff series in the 10 seasons before Russell arrived (*he was a rookie in '57*), and both were short best-of-3 series (‘53, ‘55), b) Boston went 34-48 and missed the playoffs in ‘70 right after winning the title in Russell’s final season, and c) when he missed games during his career, the Celtics were 10-18 (.357), and 18 of those 28 missed games were against teams with losing records, so there was no excuse for a “loaded” squad to be so bad. When Russell missed 3 or more games in a row --*meaning his teammates really had to adjust &amp; couldn’t just “get up” for one game without their leader*-- the Celtics were a pitiful 1-12. They were horrible without him. There is *NO* evidence the Celtics were any good when Russell wasn’t on the floor, rather a ton of evidence to the contrary.   **2)** WINNING (Part 2): It's been commonly reported that Russell was 21-0 in winner-take-all games, but that’s incorrect …. he was 22-0. If Russell's team played even with an opponent throughout a series or got to the same place in a tournament, Russell's team was ALWAYS going to pull it out in the end.   * At USF, his '55 team was [5-0](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/san-francisco/1955-schedule.html) in the tourney on the way to the title.   * At USF, his '56 team was [4-0](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/san-francisco/1956-schedule.html) in the tourney on the way to the title.   * In the '56 Olympics, the US squad was [2-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_1956_Summer_Olympics#Final_round) when it came to the winner-take-all Final 4 for gold after the group stage.  * In the NBA, the Celtics were famously [10-0](https://asipofsports.com/2017/11/16/stories-you-should-know-bill-russell-in-game-7s/#:%7E:text=April%2015%2C%201965%2C%20Eastern%20Conference%20Finals%3A&amp;text=The%20two%20Centers%20played%20to,Chamberlain%3A%2030%20Points%2032%20Rebounds.) in Games 7's throughout his career.   * In the '66 playoffs, the Celtics won Game 5 in the best-of-5 series with Cincinnati ([link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1966.html)).  **3)** WINNING (Part 3): The Celtics *didn’t* win the title only 2 times during Russell’s 13-year career, and both were (very likely) due to difficulties experienced by Russell.   * In 1958, the Hawks topped Boston 4-2 in the Finals (*winning by 2, 3, 2, &amp; 1 points*), during which Russell missed 2 games and played at far less than 100% with a horribly sprained ankle when he was available in the series. It’s safe to say Boston would have won that title with a healthy Russell.   * In 1967, the aging Celtics, fresh off of 8 straight championships, lost to the loaded and younger Sixers in the ECF. This was the first year Russell was Boston’s player-coach, which is significant since he faced horrendously stressful &amp; over-the-top racism as the first black coach in major US pro sports history. He played so much and so intensely (*43.3 min/gm in the playoffs*) that he often forgot to sub players which hurt his team. The next season, the Celtics were older &amp; considered “done”, but he added a bench coach to handle subs, and they beat the favored defending champion Sixers in the playoffs, and then won the title. Then the “seriously, they’re done now” 1968-69 Celtics clawed their way into the Finals &amp; beat the loaded West-Wilt-Baylor Lakers 4-3 in Russell’s final season. Oh yeah, Russell was the only player-coach in NBA history to win a championship, and he won two.  Two giant asterisks have to go beside the only two championships Boston *didn’t* win during Russell’s career.   **4)** WINNING (Part 4): Russell went to college at the University of San Francisco which had just suffered through 3 straight losing seasons before he joined the varsity team.  He lead an *unranked* USF team to 2 consecutive NCAA titles during his junior and senior seasons, going 57-1 along the way, and he could have won a title all 3 seasons he played at USF if not for losing teammate K.C. Jones one game into their sophomore season; they smashed the #17 team 51-33 in game 1 with Jones playing who was then hospitalized that night with a burst appendix, but 1st-year Russell still lead them to a 14-7 record without the HOF PG before going on to those 2 titles. Even at the college level, he could lead players who weren’t supposed to win to the ultimate heights; it wasn’t just in Boston. Also, he was the leading scorer, rebounder, and defender on the 1956 gold medal winning US Olympic team, which had an average margin of victory of +53, the highest ever (*’92 Dream Team was +44*).   **5)** CLUTCH: I already mentioned how dominant Russell’s teams were when it was all on the line, but I’ll add that his list of clutch games, series, and moments is ridiculously long, plus his ppg, rpg, and apg averages all rose in the playoffs. I’ll simply point out that he had the greatest Game 7 performance of all-time in the 1962 Finals, scoring 30 points &amp; grabbing 40 rebounds to win the title in a super-tight Game 7. If you didn’t know, the NBA Finals MVP award is officially called the [Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award).   **6)** INTELLIGENCE: Part of what made Russell so unbelievable in big games and moments was that his IQ and level of manipulating opponents is unparalleled historically. On defense, he’d often intentionally “just miss” blocking a particular star player’s shots earlier in a contest, but late in the game when the opponent was lulled into thinking they could get a certain shot off over Russell that night, he’d extend the extra inch and come up with clutch blocks &amp; defensive plays they weren't expecting. I’ve never heard of another player doing stuff like this. The stories about his IQ are legendary &amp; numerous; [here are some clips about his hoops IQ](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e5oc69/imo_bill_russell_had_one_of_the_highest_bbiqs_ever/). At least watch the 3rd one on that list (""Some more mindgames"") to see a short interview with him talking about manipulation of a star opponent in a way I’ve never heard another player articulate; he truly was thinking on a whole different level to create advantages for his team.   **7)** VERSATILITY: Bill Russell was so versatile on the floor because he trained and [played all 5 positions on offense](https://youtu.be/SF22xiRxHv8). The only other players in history who could maybe do this are Maurice Stokes and Giannis Antetokounmpo, but Russell’s results were quite different, plus immediate &amp; sustained. His value to the Celtics’ offense is WAY underrated, especially [on the fast break](https://youtu.be/PEs4KC4xHE0) where he arguably had a bigger influence than Steve Nash did for the Suns’ fast break due to how well he could start, run, and finish it.   **8)** PASSING &amp; OFFENSIVE INFLUENCE: Speaking of his versatility on the fast break, Bill Russell was a great passer, both in the half-court &amp; full-court, and put up insane assist numbers for a center, especially in the playoffs (*averaged &gt;5 apg in the playoffs during 7 different seasons, far more times than any other center*).  John Havlicek, in his [1977 autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/Hondo-Celtic-Motion-John-Havlicek/dp/0133946010/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=john+havlicek&amp;qid=1612990148&amp;rnid=2941120011&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1), said the following about Russell's effect on Boston's offense when specifically discussing their first post-Russell season ('70):   &gt; ""You couldn't begin to count the ways we missed [him]. People think about him in terms of defense and rebounding, but he had been the key to our offense. He made the best pass more than anyone I have ever played with. That mattered to people like Nelson, Howell, Siegfried, Sanders, and myself. None of us were one on one players ... Russell made us better offensive players. His ability as a passer, pick-setter, and general surmiser of offense has always been over-looked.”  I’ll add that Bill Russell finished 4th in MVP voting with an 18% vote share in 1969, his final season ([‘69 MVP voting](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1969.html)). I believe this is the best MVP finish by any player in their final season.  **CONTINUED IN NEXT COMMENT**"
"Awesome read, thx for posting - loved this part:  &gt; None of the beat writers are sure how much of their stuff Antetokounmpo reads, though they’re fairly sure he doesn’t take any of it too seriously. Before the January 16 game against Memphis, Nehm tweeted that Antetokounmpo hadn’t dunked in three games. Then Antetokounmpo dunked all over the Grizzlies. After the game, Antetokounmpo comically trolled Nehm: “I downloaded the [Twitter] app on my phone. Eric said, ‘Oh, yeah, Giannis hasn’t dunked for three days.’ … I was really sad. Eric was my guy.’” Nehm was shocked.  lmao...Giannis is just the best."

"Hollinger and Duncan (podcast duo) actually just finished up a 2 part series on which teams they think are the best to support over the next 5 years.   Watch some highlights, read about some players, and listen to that and I think you'll have an idea. But don't stick too hard to one team at the start, you'll find what you like over time   &gt;Is youth development different in the NBA in comparison to hockey and soccer?  Very. In the NBA teams have nothing to do with the players basically until they are drafted.    &gt;Do players that get drafted in round 1 make the roster right away, or do they play in college for 4 years and then compete for a roster spot or play on the farm team  If you're a 1st round pick your contract is already guaranteed, so the team is gonna be paying you no matter what, so they pretty much all play on the team for at least a bit. Some of them won't last on their teams and in the league, but the guys at the top all generally do. The 2nd round is a different story, their contracts aren't guaranteed and the majority of them never make their teams roster and they never play in the NBA.   Players never draft someone and have them go to college, you'll kind of see it with Europeans who get drafted by a team but stay and play in Europe, but never still going to college. To be drafted players also have to be a year removed from highschool, which usually means playing a year in college before heading to the NBA.   &gt; I understand drafts are essential but do picks have very high value or do teams just trade them continually?  Picks have a high value, but it's a pretty steep value curve, the ones at the top are worth much more than ones later on. How this value works out depends on the draft and how many good players there are. A top 3 pick in a good draft can be worth five times a pick at 12. Teams do trade picks a lot, usually as a move to help them win now at the expense of success in the future. As such most of the picks that get traded are from good teams that are expecting their picks to not be very high anyway (examples like the Nets, Lakers, Bucks), but sometimes doesn't work out and not very good teams owe picks (Rockets, TWolves, the Nets of the past).     &gt;Are there lots of young players that get drafted later rounds that actually make it to the NBA rosters or do they get trapped on the farm team and used as trade bait/salary moves?   It's pretty common for 2nd round draft picks to make it onto NBA teams. It's less than half, especially as you get to the end of the draft, but not insignificant each draft. There's also stars that every once in a while come from the 2nd round, Jokic is currently an MVP candidate and he was the 41st pick. I wouldn't say they get trapped on the farm team (in the NBA this is called the G-League), but it's pretty common for them to be sent down to get reps. You will see 2nd round picks and players moved pretty often, they aren't seen to carry a lot of value, but they are probably the cheapest asset that is still positive value.   &gt;Do top picks bust frequently, as a Canadian, I do know that the hype on Wiggins and Bennett completely died out after 1 year. I haven't kept a close eye on them but it seems that they couldn't transition their game/skills to an NBA starter level?  I wouldn't say frequently, but it definitely ain't unheard of. I think failing to make it to the level of a starter is rarer (Wiggins is actually a starter), but it's pretty common to not meet expectations.   In 2018 Marvin Bagley with the 2nd pick and probably won't be a good player, Markelle Fultz in 2017 was the 1st pick but immediately disappointed and is now just a good player, Dragan Bender in 2016 with the 4th pick is already out of the league. There seems to be at least one high level prospect per draft who doesn't get near their expectations.   &gt;I watch hockey and soccer, but the Salary Cap and contract situation in the NBA is much different, based on my understanding, it seems to promote rich owners to throw money and build super teams, so does it make the NBA a bit stale to watch?  There is a salary cap in the NBA, it's just a soft cap, and there is also a cap on the salaries of players. So you can go over the cap, but there are a bunch of restrictions to limit your ability to do so, primarily you can go over the cap to sign players that are already on your team, but you can't go over the cap to get other teams players. However, going over the cap does lead to you ending up in the luxury tax, which the more you go into the more expensive it gets  There's still a big market advantage, but it's to varying degrees. My Nets were able to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in free agency because they are located in New York, but also because they have shown themselves to be a competent franchise who can get some modicum of success. While across the city the Knicks are the most valuable franchise in the NBA, and they haven't been able to get a free agent in close to 10 years because they are so bad. So rich owners (so long as they aren't cheap) have less impact, but the markets teams are in have an impact. The big exception to this I would say is the Lakers, who I think has just a massive free-agent advantage over other teams  On the other hand, some small-market teams are able to hold onto really high-level players over the long term. As I said before there is a player salary cap, where players can only be paid so much. But this quantity is affected by a range of things, firstly how long a player has been in the league, secondly if a player signs with their own team then they can get more and for longer, and thirdly if they are eligible for getting the supermax, which you have to reach certain performance levels for and you can only get re-signing with your team. For example, this led to Giannis Antetokounmpo resigning a 5-year supermax deal with his very small market team the Bucks   &gt;Which NBA organizations are the best to consider supporting for?    Listen to that aforementioned podcast. You want to get on board with a team that is still on the way up, and that once they get there they have a chance to stick around for a while. Just listening to your description of what you want in your team I'd consider anyone except Knicks, Nets, Lakers, Clippers, Warriors because they tend to be the centres of a lot of drama and free agent talk, and just due to competence anyone except the Twolves, Kings, or Wizards, and maybe the Pistons  Just listening to your criteria I think Grizzlies might be a strong option, they are an alright team currently, but they are built around a great young core that should find success in the future. And the franchise has an incredibly strong identity that envelops the team, the Grizzlies are synonymous with Grit and Grind and I don't think that will change anytime soon. Oh and Ja Morant pretty frequently fucks people up with his dunks"

The problem if any, is balance, as Europe has too many bigs with those, plus Gobert, Markkanen, and Capela, and not that many guards.  Doncic/Fournier/Antetokounmpo/Jokic/Gobert beats your European team, in my opinion.

"It was during this 2003-2004 range that KG registered 1 of only 5 seasons ever when a player recorded the most points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks for their team.

"&gt;The salary difference was $50k/year, minus the additional income Abdul-Jabbar would have earned by playing in New York City.  We cannot know the exact value, but it's ""a few thousand dollars"".  When people discuss NBA contracts they talk about the lump sum. Example...  [""Giannis Antetokounmpo is re-signing with the Milwaukee Bucks on a five-year supermax contract worth $228 million.""](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-plan-b-giannis-antetokounmpo-milwaukee-bucks)  So ""a few thousand"" was just you communicating poorly. Me correcting to you a million and informing you about the check was proper.  &gt;If you can actually form memories, perhaps you just learned something today. Doubtful, though.  Funny because a key part of the discussion is the process by which the brain forms memories. Which is why high neuroplasticity causes absent-mindedness. Care to try to debate that with me, since you claim to be able to judge it? :)  &gt;If you think dropping an irrelevant buzzword, in a pathetic attempt to deflect attention from your complete ignorance of the subject at hand impressed anyone, you may be dumber than I even suspected.  We're talking about someone forgetting something and whether or not them being highly intelligent means they were less or more likely to do so. That's actually a known and studied issue. Neuroplasticity is key to it. You want to claim to be smart here, so don't be scared. Tell me why the existing theory, which suggests exactly what I said about Einstein's behavior and what Mikan likely did, is wrong. :)  &gt;My composure is just fine, thanks -- I was just forced to, once again, explain to you another of the many, many things about which you are completely ignorant.  Awww, is he stomping his feet now, steaming at the ears throwing insults and now trying to posture that ""I'm not mad!"" Like a 5-year-old?  &gt;Here you have completely lost the plot. If you can read -- which seems very much up-for-debate at this point -- you will note that I wrote that Mikan was one of the smartest basketball players ever **and** a tremendously-successful lawyer.   &gt;   &gt;You keep ignoring half of that statement, in your continued embarrassing attempts to backtrack, but you are fooling no one.  I already answered both parts of your statement. You said he was one of the smartest basketball players ever, I told you that that intelligence doesn't translate to unrelated areas so you mentioned something irrelevant which showed you don't really understand the topic. You also then claimed he was a successful lawyer which is why I added that actual rote numbers and details get forgotten as well even among people who work in that field, such as Einstein forgetting physical constants and having to write them down and keep a sheet with him.  &gt;If you were not dumb as a stump, I would not be forced to repeatedly explain such simple concepts to you.  You're struggling here, and saying this over and over to try to bolster your flagging ego.  &gt;A phenomenon that you have a great deal of personal experience with, obviously.   &gt;   &gt;I am familiar with the irrelevant concept that you are trying to hide your ignorance behind. Perhaps it is your own neuroplasticity which has caused you to repeatedly ""forget"" the eye-witness account of the negotiation, that I posted? You can re-read it above, as is obviously necessary.  Ooh, careful there, cowboy. By claiming to be familiar with it, you might accidentally posture yourself into a discussion you're not equipped to have.  I do have quite a bit of neuroplasticity, in this case though we're not talking about irrelevant details, but things which are amusing to me, and I thus store them very easily. I addressed your claims about the negotiation by telling you that you should complain to the publishers who put out actual books and sources that say otherwise, that's when you had your little fit about it and why you have such a frustrated and angry tone now. Remember? :)  &gt;Oh please, for the love of god, do! I want to hear you repeatedly describe your memory defect for everyone who is still reading. And please, continue embarrassing yourself by pretending to have intimate knowledge George Mikan's brain, and please regale us with your fantastic stories that are contradicted by all of the people who were there, and -- very much unlike you -- have a clue what they are talking about.  Good! You had no knowledge at all of how high neuroplasticity, a part of being smart, could cause people to fail to store certain memories including when they were in the person's field and when the person was intelligent, and why in fact it could make them MORE forgetful.  But since you claim to be ""familiar"" with it, why don't you show me. Explain to me why that's the case?  I actually had explained it in an earlier paragraph in this post, but I just went back and deleted that paragraph so you can inform me instead. While there is some clueless neuroscience work published on places like NCBI, there's been a lot of good work on this one in particular, so don't get it wrong or I'll know. :)"

Just checked and it doesn't really seem like it.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo, the most popular player in the NBA the past 2 years. Inspirational."
"So why, exactly, would you rather have Antetokounmpo taking those low-percentage shots that Duncan took?  Even a three by Giannis is as-good as a Duncan mid-range shot."
"Do you mean, what if Antetokounmpo was a far less-efficient scorer?  Giannis has a .550 career effective FG%, which is far better than Duncan's .507, despite Duncan being almost constantly surrounded by Hall of Famers and All-stars.  For the past three seasons, Antetokounmpo has been around 59%, which Duncan never even dreamed of hitting.  Duncan's offensive game is wildly overrated, and he was an inefficient scorer even in his era."

... yes we do ... Seth is constantly compared to Steph. You never mention an Antetokounmpo without mentioning Giannis.
The team is not supposed to get better but getting that much worse is not good especially since the offseason acquisitions were supposed to fix this.

Unless your name is Giannis Antetokounmpo
"Thanasis Antetokounmpo wouldn’t be on the bucks if it weren’t for Giannis, he really isn’t a valuable member of the team. The facts that team is so riddled with injuries is why he gets any play time."

"Correct. Bob McAdoo and Dominique Wilkins.  3 guys made it in, but weren't on the original list and were mid career. Dennis Rodman, Reggie Miller and Gary Payton.  There were other guys in the league / rookies but obviously didn't have enough resume, since it was 1996/97. That gets Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash.  Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce were another year or two away and Dwayne Wade was a few more years.  The rest of the new list is all active. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Russ Westbrook.  No real issues maybe other than Davis and Lillard, how do they stack up against full career Tony Parker, Tracy McGrady, Chris Webber, Vince Carter and especially nearly full career Dwight Howard who seems a glaring omission. Does Grant Hill get any leeway for what he should've become and proved he could be (although for not long enough)?  Anyone likely a lock for this in 25 years when they do 100 years? Doncic? Jokic?

"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"

But obviously he was so young and raw and played in a really low level pro league that it was hard to see if it'd translate against better competition and how much he could improve on his strengths."

"&amp;#x200B;  &gt;Milwaukee stud Giannis Antetokounmpo is a free agent in 2021 and could want a bigger stage. But “The Greek Freak’’ has no ties to New York other than bad thoughts about brother, Thanasis, not being treated well while with the Knicks organization.   &gt;   &gt;The Knicks were actually ahead of the curve on acquiring Giannis’ brother. They drafted Thanasis No. 51 in 2014. Surprising even his own agent, Thanasis signed to play for New York’s minor-league affiliate for rather than signing overseas for a far higher salary. However, the Knicks fired their minor-league coaches after the season, reportedly due to unhappiness with Thanasis’ development. The parent club signed Thanasis in 2015 but gave him just a small guarantee. He didn’t make the regular-season roster, New York leaving an open spot. The Knicks signed him to a 10-day contract later in the season.

"Well, ""Giannis Antetokounmpo therapist"" didn't turn anything relevant up on Google. So I don't know what he saw them for, if it's a therapist or a sports psychologist, whatever. To reiterate the distinction though, seeing a therapist for a mental health issue is serious and should be encouraged. Seeing a sports psychologist because you're bad at 3s is funny and should be mocked."
[Giannis stopper?](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/giannis-antetokounmpo-individual-game-stats-vs-philadelphia-76ers) Really Simmons is gonna be useless on offense for the Nets because KD and Harden will have the ball more than him and he’s not an off-ball threat. Defensively yeah he can slow one guy but he doesn’t elevate a defense as a whole. That defense will still be pretty bad.

"https://www.deseret.com/sports/2020/12/22/22193242/utah-jazz-rudy-gobert-contract-extension-nba-donovan-mitchell-ryan-smith  I am trying to understand the numerical logic of not giving centers the max.  &gt; The Utah Jazz gave Rudy Gobert the third largest contract in league history and made him the highest paid center ever when they agreed to a **five-year, $205 million** contract extension Sunday ...  &gt; After being named NBA Defensive Player of the Year twice, Gobert was eligible for up to 35% of the cap (roughly **$228 million over five years**), the same amount that Giannis Antetokounmpo just signed on for in Milwaukee, but Gobert took a discount.  Let me get this straight.  Saving $23 million over 5 years for a $200+ million contract is going to get the Jazz more wins exactly how?  &gt; Looking toward the future, the discounted price that Gobert agreed to does give the Jazz a little bit of flexibility, but it still means the Jazz will more than likely be a luxury tax-paying team once Gobert and Donovan Mitchell’s extensions kick in next season.  Is the argument that saving about $4 million a year going to help the Jazz get under the luxury tax threshold some year so they can reset it and avoid some sort of repeater tax?  I don't know.  It seems to me it is important to not give the max just as a pride thing for a team to say it didn't give the max."

"In personal accolades he is far surpassing Curry. More all defensive teams, DPOY, FMVP. He simply has more all around game and therefore more awards come his way (in particular, the defensive types). In General Steph has some top 25 - top 30 ranking in *personal* accolades. Not saying that accolades are everything, however they sure show a much stepper trajectory for Antetokounmpo.   Steph had a crazy peak, but even at his peak he was winning no FMVP or rings without help. Giannis already did both at an age younger than Steph's first ring."

"Article Summary:   Antetokounmpo has gradually improved his shot profile since the 2017 season, allowing for a better spaced attack that sets up his teammates better.  Simmons, well … hasn’t really improved his shot profile at all during that time. Like, at all.  Whether it’s half-court or transition (Last season, Antetokounmpo finished in the 75th percentile leading the offense in transition. Simmons finished in the 27th percentile), Giannis is just above and beyond better on offense because he’s taken positive steps toward shooting and getting to the free throw line.  *Article has supporting shot profile diagrams that are hilariously interesting to this point."

As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."

"*Got removed for being a low effort post, so I will put it in the discussion thread.*  **It is ok not to max Ayton NOW, probably even the correct move. Same with all rookie contract players except superstars.**  The important thing is that this does not mean that Ayton will not play for the Suns on a max contract. It just means they aren't giving it to him a year early.      He has 1 more season before becoming an RFA. That means that in the 2022 offseason, the Suns have the ability to offer him more money than any other team, and the ability to match any other team's offer. His only way to get off the Suns, if he wants to, will be to take an immense financial risk by playing on the QO. Even if he does that, he still has to play with them in 2022-23.      So the incentive is really not there to offer him the max now.      **An example of why not to do it:** Andrew Wiggins signed a 5-year max extension after 3 seasons, but had a down 4th year and overall did not improve like the Wolves hoped.      **An example of a team not offering the max:** Kawhi Leonard won the 2014 Finals MVP in his 3rd season, but the Spurs did not extend him. The following offseason, he signed a 5-year max contract and stayed a Spur.      **An example of a team offering less and the player accepting it:** Giannis Antetokounmpo signed a 4-year extension at slightly below the max after his 3rd season."

"Giannis Antetokounmpo won his first ring after failing the past few seasons. This was the first ring for the Bucks since 1971. If LeBron won a ring, there would still be articles about his legacy posted now. Yet the entire time, the media is focused on a guy who blew his chance instead of the champion who went against the idea of making a superteam."
"Giannis 'padding stats in Garbage time' Antetokounmpo: 35 minutes on the court,  Kevin 'meaningful buckets only to try and regain the lead' Durant: 40 minutes on the court , spent more time on the court in the second half, took same amount of shots in the 4th.  You're obviously just basing your whole thing off a series you, like any human being, only remember the highs of.

"Welcome to the NBA. There are a few historical basics:   1)Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. Many people including myself believe that Lebron James can catch him but it'll require a few more accolades.   2) Some of the greatest NBA teams of all time are the 60's Celtics, 80's Lakers, 90's Bulls, 99-03 Lakers, and mid2010's Warriors.   3) There have been more and more rules introduced to make it harder to play defense because flashy offense is what crowds love and brings the big $$$ to the league.   4) Lakers-Celtics is one of the biggest and most competitive sports rivalries of all time.      Now some points that are relevant to this season and more recent times:   5) The Warriors team mentioned above was so good largely due to having two of the best three point shooters of all time. They helped influence the league to dramatically increase its rate of three point shooting.   6) The Lakers and Nets are the championship favorites this year.   7) Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, James Harden, and Luka Doncic are currently regarded as some of the best players in the league.   8) Enjoy the NBA! During the season there are games every night so there's always some NBA action to watch. It's a beautiful sport. I hope that the Lakers become your favorite team."

"[you don’t think him missing time during a playoff series had anything to do with it….](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2907927-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-heads-to-locker-room-after-suffering-ankle-injury.amp.html)  You can’t call it a choke job when he has a 2-1 lead, gets injured and then ends up losing the series   Also the raptors were a stacked team that just happened to have two ex dpoy big men, a dpoy and all time great wing defender, and some of the best guard defense in the league. They would have been heavy finals favorites if the warriors weren’t literally the greatest team of all time. The raptors were the one team that could totally shut down Giannis for a full series just because they had so many elite defenders on one team to throw at him and stack the box."

"Embiid up until June 19th (7 days before the draft) when news of his stress fracture broke was the consensus #1 pick and Cleveland was planning on selecting him. Everything changed with the injury.   Wiggs was almost certainly going to go #3 to Philly.   Lebron, embiid, and Kyrie would have made up the cavs big 3 those years if embiid didn’t get hurt - unless bron still demanded a trade for Kevin Love in which we would have had a Timberwolves with KAT, Lavine and Embiid.   Even crazier “what could have been” is the bucks taking Embiid and a Antetokounmpo, Embiid, Middleton.   Not even sure which of Bron/Kyrie/Embiid - Giannis/Middleton/Embiid - KAT/Levine/Embiid I’d prefer. Probably Cleveland’s for the years against the Warriors and the bucks long term heading into the 2020s but a lot of implications from that injury to Jo."
"Yep. There was always this feeling that Robinson's skill set never *quite* fit into the role he was asked to play. Granted, he was still amazing, but one couldn't help but wonder if some of his assets weren't being fully utilized by mostly throwing him into the post or elbow.    [This play against Michael Jordan gets cited a lot, because it's a gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKVqpXl3M18&amp;ab_channel=VideoLonghorn). However, we didn't see that from Robinson nearly as much as we probably could have because he was still trying to fit into that traditional center mold.   He wasn't as good as a ball handler as Giannis Antetokounmpo, but I would still see him as being more of a Giannis type in today's game (and I imagine his ball handling would have been even better if he were allowed to more readily take off in the open floor).   In fact, I think it's guys like David Robinson coming through who helped nudge the game toward a place where seven-footers were provided a bit more freedom to be versatile if they could prove themselves capable."

"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"Whenever you devise a metric, you always want it to spew out like 90% what you'd expect and 10% you didn't.   Unrelatedly, the top 6 in EPM are   1. Nikola Jokic  2. Steph Curry  3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Kevin Durant  6. Gary Payton II  Who would have expected Durant to be up there?"
"As a Raptors fan, I'd take Giannis over KD. Our core would be: Fred VanVleet (27), OG Anunoby (24), Pascal Siakam (27), Scottie Barnes (20), Giannis Antetokounmpo (26).  That roster is absolutely disgusting and would peak at the right time to maintain a dynasty. It's impossible contract-wise and Giannis ain't leaving, but a man can dream. Imagine the ***length***."
"&gt; **Brook Lopez:** [...] Two of my teammates, Jordan Nwora and Giannis’s brother Thanasis [Antetokounmpo], are huge into manga. Giannis enjoys it, too, but Thanasis is … my goodness. He might be the biggest manga/anime fan I’ve met in the NBA. On plane rides he’s always watching different animes. He always comes to games with different hoodies or tees with manga characters on them. So he loves it. He’d be all about contributing.  How long until we see Thanasis wearing ahegao hoodie as his pregame fit?"
The Giannis Life with Giannis Antetokounmpo
"As a first generation Asian-American who spends plenty of time in circles with native born Asians, plenty of them only know Jeremy Lin for his ethnicity. The fact of the matter is that yes, Jeremy Lin, was born in California, but he's more prominent in the public eye of most Asians because he's Taiwanese-American. My Korea-born dad who doesn't know who James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, or Dwight Howard are knows who Jeremy Lin is."
"Nah what we should really do is cheat like baseball players. I'm totally game. Imagine Giannis right? But with more FREAK. Juice him up. I want his name to be Giannis ""The Barry Bonds"" Antetokounmpo. I want coaches to be able to spy on each others playbook and throw up gang signs to explain what the other team is going to do. Also seriously speaking absolutely nah. It's easier to impact the floor as a basketball player than mediate the field as a baseball player. Look at the absolute UNIT Mike Trout. Man's made one playoff game despite being the best baseball player for awhile. He's still a HOF by a long shot."

"To be clear - I'm no Kobe hater (unless people do ridiculous things like pretend he's MJ/Lebron level)... and I do think the ""inefficient"" stuff is WAY overplayed and not true.  However, numbers don't like.  The guy is great, but he's a notch below the super elite offensive guys.  Look at career OBPM:  &amp;#x200B;  1.	Michael Jordan\*	7.17   2.	LeBron James	7.05   3.	Stephen Curry	6.23   4.	Kevin Durant	6.03   5.	James Harden	5.95   6.	Magic Johnson\*	5.93   7.	Damian Lillard	5.48   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.35   9.	Chris Paul	5.18   10.	Larry Bird\*	5.12   11.	John Stockton\*	4.90   12.	Kyrie Irving	4.83   13.	Tracy McGrady\*	4.69   14.	Julius Erving\*	4.64   15.	Anthony Davis	4.64   16.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.62   17.	Kawhi Leonard	4.55   18.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	4.43   19.	David Robinson\*	4.43   20.	Steve Nash\*	4.35  &amp;#x200B;  And playoff OBPM:  1.	Michael Jordan\*	8.81   2.	LeBron James	7.62   3.	Nikola Jokić	7.45   4.	Kevin Durant	6.44   5.	Stephen Curry	6.37   6.	Tracy McGrady\*	6.17   7.	Magic Johnson\*	6.08   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.42   9.	Larry Bird\*	5.40   10.	Kawhi Leonard	5.35   11.	Julius Erving\*	5.33   12.	James Harden	5.26   13.	Giannis Antetokounmpo	5.23   14.	Chris Paul	5.23   15.	Dirk Nowitzki	5.19   16.	Damian Lillard	5.14   17.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	5.04   18.	Reggie Miller\*	5.03   19.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.98   20.	Allen Iverson\*	4.85  &amp;#x200B;  Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)  I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).  Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.  I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier."
" OG Anunoby, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bam Adebayo  that trio defensively"
Bucks: Giannis Antetokounmpo  That’s one of the easiest questions I’ve had to answer in a while
"From the article:  “It’s all well and good that we have some other things to entertain us, like Steph Curry doing Steph things with a real team around him in Golden State and the DeMar DeRozan-led Bulls trucking teams in the East.  Just don’t lose sight of the big picture, folks: Jokic is still the most effective regular-season player in basketball. Voters seemingly reluctantly gave him the MVP last year and again appear to be scanning the universe for alternatives, and it may be harder to convince them after seeing Curry go amazeballs on Tuesday in the league’s most prominent TV game of the season.  People: I get the Stephmania and all because the Warriors have been unbelievable (and we’ll get to that soon here), but for the love of all that is holy, would you please stop dismissing Jokic? He’s basically a 7-foot point guard at this point, dragging an injury-riddled Denver team to competence.  Yet we’ve heard comparatively little Jokic banter thus far, despite the fact that through 13 games, his PER of 35.4 ranks … (checks notes) … first all-time.  All. Time.  By a wide margin, actually — the all-time best heading into this year was 31.86 by Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019-20. It’s only 13 games, and maybe Jokic’s numbers will dip as the year goes on, but nothing about his start has seemed particularly fluky or weird.  Even relative to the other four players who have been notably awesome in the early part of the season, Jokic has been on a completely different level.  We’re blessed with some awesome players right now, but in terms of production, it’s The Joker’s world. Yet, reading the tea leaves, it already seems very possible Jokic won’t repeat as MVP due to some combination of voter boredom and embarrassing oversight.  (Also, while we’re here: It is an unconscionable, embarrassing mistake that Jokic was left off the league’s top 75 players of all-time list, just to leave room for misty-eyed wistfulness about the fourth-best players on Lakers, Celtics and Knicks teams of yore. “Sure, this Jokic fella is good, but he’s no Dave DeBusschere.”)  The breadth of what The Joker is doing is overwhelming. Skill-wise, he’s the best passer in the league, but he’s also second in rebounding; oh, and he’s shooting 38.3 percent on 3s. And — get this — he’s sixth in scoring, while very nearly leading the league in 2-point shooting percentage at 66.3 percent.  Defensively, he’s less off-the-charts awesome, but his IQ and giant mitts still make him effective. (Fun fact: Jokic has more steals than Giannis, Trae Young or Kevin Durant. He’s in the league’s top 50 in both steal and block rate.) The Nuggets, quietly, are third in the NBA in defensive efficiency despite missing multiple key players, which sort of neutralizes the “WuT AbOUt hIs D?” angle.  In addition to having the best individual stats in the league, Jokic’s impact stats are borderline hilarious. The Nuggets are plus-14.2 points per 100 possessions when he plays, minus-11.6 when he sits, nearly a 26-point swing depending on whether he’s in the game.  The eye test backs up the numbers. He’s steadily improved his doughy physique and now moves better than ever, gliding past opponents in transition and making guard-like moves closer to the rim. As a roller, it’s been interesting to see him use long strides and (gasp!) athleticism to get chances close to the rim rather than ambling into jump hooks like he used to.  And mixed in, of course, are assorted displays of a rare basketball genius. He’s reinventing the game on the fly, doing stuff no big man has ever done and adding to the repertoire as he goes. Oh, here, let me just whip this one-handed, no-look, pick-and-roll dish to a driving Aaron Gordon.  Even as the Nuggets scuffle along in fits and starts through early injuries and bad bench units, Jokic has been unbelievable. Night to night, he’s not just the most effective player in the league, but he also makes at least one mind-blowing play every single game … and everyone just kind of ignores it and goes about the day. Playing in the Rocky Horror Time Zone doesn’t help, but it’s still weird. It doesn’t help that the league still markets him like he’s Mason Plumlee.  Fans of good basketball: Appreciate this guy. He is an awesome, generational talent at the absolute peak of his powers.”"

In the first two clips, AD doesn't go up strong enough for a rebound, takes his time getting up off the ground, never breaks into a sprint to try to prevent mismatches from developing in transition... and it wasn't like he exerted a bunch of effort in a frantic sequence leading up to this. The end result (an iffy call on THT that was non-shooting anyways) isn't the problem for the Lakers in this scenario, but with the way Giannis feasted on him last night, that could have easily been an easy bucket or and-1."

ADs dad's name is Giannis Antetokounmpo.   We witnessed it tonight
"&gt;	Less than four hours before tipoff came what multiple sources inside the organization call “an oh-shit moment”: Thanasis Antetokounmpo — the back-slapping, whisper-in-the-ear older brother and bench-warming teammate of the best player in the game — was sick with cold symptoms and getting sicker. (Thanasis’ agency did not respond to questions about his condition.) He had returned a false positive, been isolated and re-tested. He would have to miss Game Five, and word eventually arrived with a confirmed result: Positive for 2019-nCoV.  &gt;	Chatter across the organization blew up:  FUCK.  &gt;	Damn, who was with T.A.? &gt;	Well, Giannis must have it.  &gt;	The Antetokompos, after all, are inseparable. “Certainly those two guys’ connection and the closeness, everybody knows it,” Budenholzer, the head coach, told reporters 90 minutes before tip-off. “But, you know, I think we’re all good. We’re all ready. Ready to go.” Pressed by a reporter, he briefly and vaguely admitted that the Bucks would not be playing with a full staff."
"Giannis is a legit physical freak who's not afraid to take contact around the rim, who also just happens to be extremely skilled. AD's entire game most of the time is skill and finesse, which can work against teams not built to defend it but when you're against Giannis fucking Antetokounmpo you're going to get owned in the paint no matter what you do lol"
"&gt;“One challenge was to bring a championship here and we did,” he told me. “It was very hard, but we did. Very, very hard. I just love challenges. What’s the next challenge? The next challenge might not be here.” It’s not that he doesn’t love Milwaukee, he said. But he was always wary of things becoming too easy. “Me and my family chose to stay in this city that we all love and has taken care of us — for now,” Giannis said. “In two years, that might change. I’m being totally honest with you. I’m always honest. I love this city. I love this community. I want to help as much as possible.”  https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-giannis-antetokounmpo-hints-future-bucks-exit-the-next-challenge-might-not-be-here-212637928.html"

People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Yeah. You definitely still need the talent and superstars to go with the modern team basketball philosophy.  But I swear, a lot of teams with stars are hard to watch. The whole, pick and roll at the top with the other 3 guys ball watching at the corners every play is so boring. Not every team has a Giannis Antetokounmpo who could dunk on everybody every play if you don't build a wall."
"[Dispelling Myths Around Gobert’s Defense](https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/)  &gt; Myth #1: Gobert can’t guard on the perimeter  &gt; Let’s start with isolation defense. This year, there were 87 players that guarded at least 50 isolations. **If mainstream highlight reels are your source of information here, you’d expect to see Rudy at the bottom of the pack. Actually, the opposite is true**. Gobert allows the seventh fewest points per possession (PPP). Opponents score an average of 0.71 points per isolation when Gobert is defending. **That’s less than Simmons (0.73), Anunoby (0.76), Bam Adebayo (0.78), Mikal Bridges (0.97), Giannis Antetokounmpo (1.06), Clint Capela (1.07), and Myles Turner (1.08)**. Gobert also allows the third lowest scoring frequency (30.6%), the eighth lowest FG% (32%), and the fourth lowest FT throw frequency (4.7%) when guarding opponents in isolation.  Wait, so you don't think having 4 other meh to poor defenders on your team would contribute to a DPOY centre getting dunked on? How do you think an offensive player gets a chance to dunk on Gobert? They have to first get downhill into the paint, which would mean they blow by their defender in isolation (which happens a lot for the Jazz) or through handoffs/screens. If you have bad defenders, do you think it makes it easier or harder for a player to get into the paint with enough freedom to go up and dunk on a 7'1 DPOY centre? And do you think having bad defenders would hold up an offensive player long enough for a big man to get into help position and ready up for a good contest vs being late on the contest? Defense is a team game, not even Rudy Gobert can single handedly cover up all the issues with the Jazz's defense, issues that aren't on him but his teammates and the coaching staff having a defensive system that is ""let Rudy Gobert just clean up your fuck ups""."

"Giannis had more of a bad mechanics problem than anything, few pictures out there of his form where he bends his legs in and arms do a weird motion when putting the ball up.   https://www.sportscasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Giannis-Antetokounmpo-3.jpg  It's not a naturally shooting motion whenever he brings the ball up from below his chest (idk about this year haven't watched any Bucks games).

"People use to say this about Brad Stevens.   [Here is an article from 2018](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23527508/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-brad-stevens-superstar-player)   Some fun takeaways from the article  &gt; FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver put the bar very high indeed, finding nearly 50/50 results on a poll asking respondents to choose between Stevens and MVP contender Giannis Antetokounmpo after the first round of the playoffs.  &gt; Remember, not that long ago it was Thibodeau's example we were using to discuss the upper bounds of value of coaches (and by we, I mean me). That's a pretty good sign that coaches' skills aren't as consistent or transferable as those of star players.  While I love Nurse and think he is a good coach, I can assure you that the players are definitely more valuable. Nurse can help elevate a team, but ultimately it’s a players league"
"Cool theory, but suggesting that Ben Simmons is ""Giannis with better court vision"" is laughably disrespectful to Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Simmons with confidence would be a bit better than he is. Simmons with the work ethic of Seth Curry is possibly an all-time top 5 player. Simmons with the work ethic of Giannis Antetokounmpo is a top-5 current player.  But Simmons doesn't have the work ethic of Seth Curry or Giannis Antetokounmpo. Simmons has the work ethic of the desk clerk at the DMV who's on their fifth smoke break this hour.  Unless you didn't mean him and you were talking about Giannis down at your local Y, in which case: I don't know that guy, but I'll take it."

"I'm assuming you're referring to the [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32260331/nbarank-2021-ranking-best-players-2021-22-5-1) and [SI](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/09/23/ranking-best-nba-players-top-100-2022-kevin-durant-giannis-antetokounmpo-lebron-james) lists. But your question ignores grammatical tense of those articles -- your question is in the *present tense* while those two outlets issued *predictions* in *future tense*. You aren't asking a question answered by them, no wonder you don't agree.  ==================  SI:  &gt;Who **will be** the NBA’s best players in the 2021–22 season?  ESPN:  &gt;We asked, ""Which player **will be** better in 2021-22?"" Voters had to predict what they expected from each player during the season.  u/Hot-Ad5735:  &gt;Who’s (i.e. who **is**) better?"
"All time: Dwyane Wade  Active: Jimmy Butler  Non Heat: LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo  Retired non Heat: Dirk Nowitzki  Began following NBA in 2003, and I’m from Miami"
"Giannis ""Hippocrates"" Antetokounmpo will not stand for this injustice, he's been studying immunology for several thousand years at this point"
"Bob taking shots at [Donnie Nelson](https://theathletic.com/1667603/2020/03/11/finding-luka-doncic/?redirected=1), confirming all of the reporting about how much they hated each other.  &gt; Twenty years after discovering Dirk Nowitzki in the German wine country, the Dallas Mavericks find Luka Doncic, another generational player from Central Europe, in the city of Madrid. The “Wonder Boy” from Ljubljana, Slovenia, this kid who first attracted the Mavericks’ attention as a 13-year-old and whose talents once inspired their executives to hide out in a nondescript hotel on a scouting trip just to disguise their affections, takes fewer than two seasons to assert himself as an MVP candidate who can carry their franchise for the next two decades. &gt;  &gt; The serendipity of it all is nothing short of storybook. &gt;  &gt; And how’s this for a reminder that the draft has the power to both humble or help any team: If Mavs owner Mark Cuban hadn’t overruled general manager Donnie Nelson in 2013 when he wanted to take a skinny Greek kid named Giannis Antetokounmpo, who would go on to become the reigning MVP, Dallas would never have been in this position to begin with. Plan Bs don’t turn out much better than this."
"&gt; The argument is that Kevin Durant is better. As a basketball player.  He's not though, he doesn't impact winning as much as Giannis Antetokounmpo does."
"The Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday were fined $50,000 by the NBA for another violation of the league's anti-tampering rule after team president Magic Johnson recently praised Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Johnson recently praised Antetokounmpo's play in an ESPN interview, saying he'd someday lead the Bucks to a championship. A source told ESPN that the fine Tuesday was for the comments made in that interview.      ""Oh yeah,"" Johnson told ESPN when asked whether he saw parallels between Antetokounmpo's play and his. ""With his ball-handling skills and his passing ability. He plays above the rim; I never could do that. But in his understanding of the game, his basketball IQ, his creativity of shots for his teammates ... that's where we \[have the\] same thing. Can bring it down, make a pass, make a play.      ""I'm just happy he's starting in the All-Star Game because he deserves that. And he's going to be like an MVP, a champion. This dude, he's going to put Milwaukee on the map. And I think he's going to bring them a championship one day."""
"Lmao the clippers get gianniS ANtetokounmpo, but the lakers and spurs get kostaS ANtetokounmpo, and thanasiS ANtetokounmpo respectively"
"This was more difficult to believe before game 6 of these Finals, but the Bucks franchise leader for consecutive free throws made in a single game is Giannis Antetokounmpo. He went 17 for 17 in a 2019 game against the Wizards."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo is currently second best PF of all time based on accolades.  Anthony Davis may be in the conversation with Giannis if he wins another championship and maybe one MVP, whether it is League MVP or Finals MVP.  &amp;#x200B;  Nowitzki and Garnett won rings, so they get ranked above Barkley and Malone. Nowitzki gets ranked above Garnett because the best player that Nowitzki had when he won was not as good as either Rondo, Ray Allen, or Pierce.  Malone has 3 NBA Finals appearances, Barkley only had one, and Malone was in the league longer, so Malone gets ranked above Barkley.     So in a few years, I see it like this:     1. Tim Duncan 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Anthony Davis 4. Dirk Nowitzki 5. Kevin Garnett 6. Karl Malone 7. Charles Barkley"
"Heel: The Tribal Chief Giannis Antetokounmpo, with this Bloodline Cousins Kostas &amp; Thanasis.  Face: AEW’s New Signees Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso"
"Since 1956, the MVP played the following positions:  point guard - 11 times (Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook)   shooting guard - 8 times (Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden)   small forward - 9 times (Julius Erving, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kevin Durant)   power forward - 12 times (Bob Pettit, Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo)   center - 26 times (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, Bill Walton, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic)"

Derrick Rose said some kind of messed up stuff at a trial, Steven Adams has been voted one of the dirtiest players in the league, Bobby Portis punched a teammate, and a lot of people don't like how much Luka Doncic complains about calls."
"Our team isn't going to win this season because Giannis Antetokounmpo is going to ascend to Mt. Olympus and become the official Greek god of basketball.  Thus, he'll be too busy to play bucks games, and despite Jrue and Khris both being khash money, I don't think those two together can win a championship without someone like Giannis there."
"It was literally an 1:1 comparison to their Nets series. In fact their Nets series (this year) seemed way more lost by GM3 (where Giannis got injured last year).  Did you read my post? Was their Nets series ""long lost"" by early GM3 this year? Heck was their finals ""long lost"" by GM3 where they were 2-0 as well?  What are you talking about? 2-0 is not insurmountable at all, the Bucks, themselves, got over such deficit twice this post season. Had Antetokounmpo no injured in GM3 there is no telling how that game would end. And with the Series at 2-1 , the Heat were the favorites still, but nowhere near how you make it to be."

"Giannis ""Lavar"" Antetokounmpo."
"I agree with your point, and also agree with the guy you responded to.   Giannis busted his ass to get to where he is. We can't and should never discount that. Granted, i'm not a huge Bucks fan but I have been really motivated and inspired when i read stories like Giannis needing to take a ride to the old Bradley Center back in the day.  But he also got super lucky. Lot of people in his position and there's only one Giannis Antetokounmpo.   His story really reminds me of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He got dealt a really tough situation early on in life but he busted his ass to change what he could. But...he also had some really lucky breaks in his life"
"lol you sound so fucking ignorant in these comments bro, stop it.   Antetokounmpo in greek is LITERALLY pronounced as Adedokubo. NT = D in greek and MP=B.   Also, Giannis never had nigerian citizenship either."

"I have him at 12 but he’s a top 10 talent.  I’d argue only Wilt, Kareem, Jordan, and LeBron are definitely better than him as a talent.  He’s in the same category as Magic, Bird, Duncan, Shaq, and Hakeem as a talent but doesn’t have the legacy those guys do.    As an aside, Russell is super underrated by people claiming he’s only be a Dennis Rodman / Draymond Green type of player but he isn’t the same talent as those guys above.  Russell has the better legacy because he was like Jordan and Kobe in his mentality and played team ball instead of superstar iso ball and was an athletic freak of nature like David Robinson, Magic Johnson, prime Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Julius Erving, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."

yea but then again you gotta understand that we're dealing with real people with characters and emotion. not some 2k shit where you know the players are limited to a certain number of actions/feelings.

"Lay up was contested by Holiday , had Kyrie missed they were open for a putback trailer dunk (which happens *a lot* when the paint is otherwise open), Antetokounmpo made the only correct basketball play in that situation. Boxed out the open area of the paint in the oft chance KY missed.  If a big was not to do what Giannis did in that situation (late for the context but at least protect the rim from possible putbacks), he should have been f@cking benched. It literally was the recommended basketball play. I don't know what you expected him to do, basically give up on that basket by allowing them a possible 2nd chance in case Kyrie missed? Seriously Bigs are being benched for less in situations like this.  Btw I hate the Kawhi-Zaza rule for similar reasons. I get ""protect the player"" and all that. Taking away the close contests (in that case though) , takes away guarding the perimeter well, it unnaturally inflates outside shooting. Similarly if what Giannis did was made to be illegal, then you'd have putbacks galore, which IMO is ugly defense..."
"That's how Giannis always go for rebounds. He has no regard for his surroundings. If Ky was not to be injured nobody would have called it unnatural.  Also going for a rebound is not the best thing he did all post season, being as ""lucky"" requires no skill at all, nor is it something one can forsee, like I said, he's done it one million times , only rarely injured anyone at all.  The best thing he (actually) did was his Finals performance, which if he had it in him during the Nets series they would have eliminated the Nets even if Ky was to be in. Prime Antetokounmpo is possibly the best player in the world and would take over the series... So yeah, turning himself into the Prime version of himself was the best thing he did all post season and he should have done it earlier so that folk like you would not think that even w KY in the Nets had a chance..."

"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."

"The brawl began with 45.9 seconds remaining in the game, when Milwaukee led 97–82. Bulls player Mike Dunlevy was fouled from behind by Bucks 2x MVP and world champion Giannis Antetokounmpo, who slapped him across the back of the head during a layup attempt. Dunlevy later said that Antetokounmpo had warned him he would be hit. Dunleavy responded by shoving Michael Carter-Williams in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep the two separated.  Bulls coach Larry Brown was not yet very concerned, because fights in the NBA rarely lasted for more than a few seconds. During the altercation, Antetokounmpo lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Bucks radio broadcaster Jim Paschke. The microphone was not live. Paschke recalled that the broadcasting team knew Antetokounmpo’s personality and ""figured it was a great time to interview him because he has a wonderful personality, A great sense of humor and the fans love him"". After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Dunleavy would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Dunleavy’s fans should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Bucks players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if Dunleavy got ejected, he would have to walk past the Bucks bench, which could have caused another incident.  Ninety seconds after Dunleavy shoved Antetokounmpo, most of both teams' players and coaches were huddled at midcourt, attempting to calm down Dunleavy[3](Jeff Teauge was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire game; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Antetokounmpo was lying on the table, Dunleavy threw a towel at him, causing Antetokounmpo to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, who shockingly was also coincidentally named Mike Dunleavy then threw a plastic cup of beer at Michael Carter-Williams, hitting him in the Teeth. Antetokounmpo jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man,  Michael Dunnothing,  who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Paschke stood up to try and hold back Antetokounmpo and was bumped slightly in the effort, and suffered no ill affects and promptly retired after A long and very successful career. Antetokounmpo’s older brother Thanasis followed Antetokounmpo into the stands and punched a Mike Dunleavy fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Michael Carter-William’s face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Additionally players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who did not play because of an injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to get praise Antetokounmpo and to celebrate. Antetokounmpo the punched Dunleavy twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's mother, Daisy .[3] More fans then began throwing drinks, food, and other objects, and a deafening “Fuck Mike Dunleavy” chant began to fill the arena.   The event garnered major media attention and was known henceforth as the “Dunleavy’s game that went badly in the Bradley” and won’t soon be forgotten."

"It just goes to show you how much the media can prop up a player of their choosing.  Everyone wanted Simmons and Embiid to be a legit EC duo but the hole in Ben’s game has been so glaringly obvious that it’s impossible to ignore unless you’re a homer.  FWIW the same was said and would have still been said about Giannis if the Suns didn’t blow their 2-0 lead, but Antetokounmpo elevated his game to another level in Games 3-6.  Absolutely destroyed fools in the paint, became Nash from the FT line and gave no fucks from 3.    Simmons needs to just let that shit fly."

"(from a comment I made two weeks ago in a different thread)  Kidd was in charge of telling Giannis he couldn't take jumpers:  &gt; Last April, Kidd told reporters at a morning shootaround in Boston that he had constricted Antetokounmpo to only shooting inside 15 feet, essentially putting training wheels back on the eccentric rising star.   Kidd would also bench Giannis for taking 3s. Not saying Kidd's to blame for everything but there's certainly an argument to be made that he stunted Giannis's jump shot development from a skill that was looking fairly promising to an afterthought. That said, Giannis has getting back on track over the past couple seasons, certainly from the mid range.

"Gianni's touch around the rim is not just ""better"", it is legendary. It's incredibly rare for a guy as big to be finishing through contact in tough angles. Harden called him the run and dunk guy but in fact he is the run and lay up guy.   Basically it is his superpower and why he is a juggernaut offensively , nobody lay ups (part of laying up is dunking, but most often than not isn't) as frequently and as well as him. Rewatch Giannis' playoff highlights, he scores going 100 miles an hour, or at crazy angles, or while being hit, it looks less impressive than when a small guy does that, however he does it way more consistently and straight way more throughout the game. Guy is volume scoring from 3ft in at 80% or sth equally crazy. That's better than prime Lebron and around the Prime Shaq territory, his touch around the rim is crazy.  Of course if you go from 5 ft out, or God forbid 10 ft out his touch disappears and only there AD has the advantage. Mane no mistake though Antetokounmpo is more of a natural scorer than Davis. His (offensive) skillset is less complete, but what he actually has is so very valuable that AD's variety doesn't make up for it. AD is not averaging 35 at the finals all the while being the first option / creating many of his point by himself...  IMO Davis is the most versatile defender *and* offensive player. I just don't know if he is actually *better* on either..."

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  19. DeAndre Ayton  20. Brandon Ingram
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"

"&gt;That's not really insane on its own, elite forwards that focus mostly on drives shoot around 70% on 2s over a season.   Surely you're conflating percentage at the rim with all 2s, right?  LeBron James (earlier in his career) and Giannis Antetokounmpo, basically the dictionary definition of ""elite forwards that focus mostly on drives"" have never topped 62% or 64% on 2 pointers respectively.  70% is on par with centers who don't shoot outside of 3 feet, like Mitchell Robinson.    Regardless, you're totally right that it is the mid-range scoring that makes this so special.  This is an absolutely absurd scoring streak that he's on.  He's drilling contested fadeaway jumpers from the free throw line on out, he's lighting it up from three, he's putting guys like Jerami Grant in a spin cycle, it looks like he's in an empty gym out there.  He's going to be gunning hard for an All Star spot this year."

Its like that in any field where there is heavy technical jargon. It is meant to convey the speaker is in the know and you are either with them and their thought processes or you are an outsider.

"I don’t know, but that Denver “Big 3” isn’t winning anything.  First of all.... they play in Denver.  Nikola Jokić is a very overrated player.

It’s close with Trae Young.   Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. might never be all stars in their career too. Kind of embarrassing to call them a big 3 when these two players are a tier below borderline all stars. They are garbage defensively too.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP and DPOY of the league, upon receiving the news that his team was facing the fifth seeded Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Semifinals [2020]: ""I'd better start choking now."""
I only agree with Giannis Antetokounmpo not reaching the Finals again.  Nets might win the championship this year and Kevin Durant will be the best player in the NBA.  Clippers are getting past the second round.  Luka Dončić might not even make the playoffs this year unless he loses some weight.
"a much better player to replace Dwight Powell's role as Luka's roller to the paint - at the super top end it's Giannis Antetokounmpo or Anthony Davis, then maybe John Collins or Chris Boucher as more realistic options?"

"&gt;He went on one podcast  Wrong. First time he said it was in an interview with GQ  &gt;But they [the media] for sure got some teams they locked in on. We all know. That’s just what it is. You can’t tell me that a guy whose team was a 14-seed at one point last year, and ended up a four-seed with everything that was going on—so many injuries—and who went on a 32-game 30-point streak, eight 50-point games, two 60-point games in one season…and all the talk was about [Giannis Antetokounmpo]? There’s no way.  This is BS. Harden got plenty of love and hype with people talking about his scoring production and carrying the Rockets.  How is this not diminishing Giannis MVP accomplishment.  Then he went on a radio station like a month later saying the same crap. Dude couldn't let it go."

I know what you're going to try and cherrypick but at least read this article. This is the third one I've cited with direct quotes from Giannis. Either you have horrible reading comprehension or you're just being dense.   I don't need to live in Greece. I'm the child of immigrants, Ik the hard work we face regardless of where we are born. It's not equal. It's even harder in Europe. The least I can do is acknowledge that, and Ill keep doing it. Ill write as much as I want, because it's the truth."
His brother gave an interview where he mocked Giannis’ notebook. He apparently does (or used to) take it with him everywhere and he’d try to teach his brothers whatever he had learned that day or whatever. It may be from the excerpt of the book that’s coming out.

"Look,this article simply wants to enforce the ""Greece bad,usa good"" narrative.  I won't lie,Getting your papers in Greece is not as easy as it should, there's a lot of paperwork involved .

"&gt; Most likely, Giannis Antetokounmpo will be a solid-to-good role player like Nicolas Batum or Lamar Odom.

Furthermore, i understand yall really have not heard a yoruba accent before, but as someone who actually has lived in greece before and has nigerian ancestry too, I can tell yall nephews that his yoruba accent features a lot more prominently than his greek accent. I bet you greek people asked him all the time where he came from because they could tell his accent wasnt quite completely greek"

Your Griffin vs Middleton point is completely irrelevant because we already know they aren't comparable players. Giannis vs (healthy) KD though is between 2 MVP caliber players, so the guy who does better gets an edge. Even fucking Giannis himself acknowledges this [here](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/giannis-antetokounmpo-on-kevin-durant-hes-still-the-best-player-in-the-world/), so the idea you dismiss it out of hand says more about you than KD.

In Greece, there might be people who felt racism at times, we might felt the same way, but I was never scared for my life. Walking down the street I was never scared that something might happen. Spending seven years here and my brother growing up here, I have conversations with him. I have conversations with my teammates. It’s tough,” Giannis said.  &gt;“People are scared to walk in the street because of the color of their skin. You’re scared for your life. I think that has to change. I just became a dad a few months ago and I’ve had a conversation with my girlfriend and it’s scary. It’s scary to raise a son here and have a family. It’s scary. I don’t feel like I should be scared at any moment that my son and my family are walking down the street, I shouldn’t be scared. I just try to educate myself as much as possible.” The reigning MVP also went back to his rookie season, when Caron Butler advised him on what it actually means to be black in the United States.  &gt;“I had Caron Butler tell me that when you walk down the street, take off your hoodie,” Antetokounmpo said. “I’m like, ‘Why should I take off my hoodie?’ and he’s like, ‘Just take off your hoodie.’ And that was my rookie year. I didn’t understand it then, but I understand it now.”"
"More like the problem is people that are twisting his words and taking them out of context.  https://uniquedestination.mitsishotels.com/articles/giannis-antetokounmpo/  &gt; What are your emotions when you wear the shirt of the Greek national team?  &gt;You are not given many opportunities to honor your homeland during your lifetime. When I wear the shirt with the national emblem I feel like I’m part of Greece and I try to give my best. I feel that, maybe in this way I am repaying Greece in gratitude, for what she has offered me during the difficult period of my life… This is one of the reasons why, together with my brother Thanasis, we held the “AntetokounBros” events in the two previous summers. These events aim to bring ourselves close to children and people who love us in general, as a small reward for all this love we receive. With “AntetokounBros” we can also offer something of ourselves to Greece in return for what she had offered us: Free education, a homeland that embraced my family in difficult times… these I will never forget in my life. I will always feel compelled and will try with every opportunity to give back.  &gt;Why is Greece your first choice for vacation and how do you feel when you return?  &gt;First of all because Greece is home … And I mean my friends, my hangouts and my memories! Yet, I do not think there is a more beautiful country in the world that combines such a harmony of visions, smells and flavors. Greece can offer you all you wish to experience. So what I’m saying to anyone who asks me is that … if they want to truly live their holidays and not just go on vacation, they MUST come to Greece!"

"This will be in every single NBA Playoffs/Finals commercial until Liam Antetokounmpo wins his 1st FMVP 22 years from now.  And every single time I see it, I'll be forever grateful to Giannis, Khris, Brook, Portis, and even Bud. This team perfectly encapsulates the personality of MKE, and champions or not, this group resonated with our city and state more than any other WI sports team since at least the '96 Packers.  In winning a championship they won over our hearts in the process.  The 2019 group may have been ""better"" as far as W-L record or ORTG or point differential, but this team perfectly culturally captured the collective soul of the city.   This team will always go down as more than a basketball team for us here, they'll go down as a beacon of hope in a normally hopesick city.   A group of 15 people that meshed harmoniously to unite 600,000.   A team that reminded us if we work together, great things can happen in this city.  We've gotten to grow up, and glow up, with Giannis. 8 years ago the whole city was metaphorically running to work because we couldn't afford a cab since we had just MoneyGrammed the last of our scratch to our family that needed it more than us.   We've all had moments where life pulls a Kawhi Leonard on us and dunks ferociously on our head to end our title hopes.  We've all wondered what greener pastures might be like, but the love we have for our city has kept us here, despite what people on the outside say about it.   Giannis had those thoughts, but he remembered we embraced him when he came here as a culture shocked Greek immigrant that was 6'8"" and 103 lbs.   He's grown to 6'11 and went from 103 lbs to 260, but he never needed to bulk up his heart, and he remembered how this city showed him love when he needed it most, so he returned the favor and signed the extension early to show us that same love back.  He's the perfect Wisconsin athlete. He's not a California OC Drama Queen that we claim we love but really just put up with because he's great at his job. He's a diamond in the rough, that ended up in a rough place that needed a diamond to shine."

"I saw Giannis Antetokounmpo at a Chick-fil-A in Milwaukee yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ""Oh, it's no problem, really. Let's take a photo!"" I was taken aback, and all I could say was ""Huh?"" but he kept cutting off my picture-taking, saying, ""Here, my brother does photography as a hobby...let's have him take the photo!"" and posing for a bunch of different pictures in front of my face. I walked away and continued browsing the menu, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him pay for like fifteen customers' orders.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ""Sir, you really don't need to pay for other customers' food."" At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually he turned back around to the counter.  When she took one of the bags of food and started ringing it up multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ""to prevent any electrical infetterence,"" and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by pushing the other customers' credit cards away and giving her his own."

"It's because he, Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, scored 50 points last night in Game 6 of the 2021 NBA Finals, securing a championship for their team. Scoring many points in a basketball game is sometimes referred to as a ""piece"", so a 50 point game would be referred to as a 50 piece. As chicken nuggets are also referred to by piece count, the aforementioned player is making a play on his performance last night in his order."
"22 year old couldn't stay in front of grown ass 26 year old MVP, DPOY Giannis ""Greek Freak"" Antetokounmpo  this sub: AYTON'S OVERRATED, DISAPPOINTING, WILL NEVER BE A STAR, HAS NO FUTURE, HAS TO BE TRADED"
"Giannis ""Franz Ferdinand"" Antetokounmpo"
"I know it's a joke, but the real reason is pretty crazy:  [https://www.brewhoop.com/2015/4/30/8525791/video-giannis-antetokounmpo-ejected-mike-dunleavy-punch-michael-carter-williams](https://www.brewhoop.com/2015/4/30/8525791/video-giannis-antetokounmpo-ejected-mike-dunleavy-punch-michael-carter-williams)  [https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/757346](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/757346)"
Giannis Antetokounmpo repeat 3peat confirmed?!
Because it's an English transliteration of the Greek transliteration of his Nigerian surname. So Giannis Adetokunbo --&gt; Γιάννης Αντετοκούνμπο --&gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo
I still can't believe people misspell Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo
"“I almost pooped” - Giannis Antetokounmpo, 2021"
"Bruh, not even Giannis knew what he could become lol.  &gt;""I always had a feeling I could maybe make it in the NBA, but I never thought I'd be 23-years old and be at the All-Star game for a second time, having a chance to win the MVP, carrying a team on my back - that's over my imagination,"" Antetokounmpo said.  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/22482096/nba-milwaukee-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-never-thought-all-star](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22482096/nba-milwaukee-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-never-thought-all-star)  Happy for Giannis though, this is a huge W for small market teams and NBA all around. Well deserved win, no doubt, enjoy it Bucks!"

Giannis Antetokounmpo is who 76ers fans expected Ben Simmons to be  And he had a career night 17/19 from the line in a closeout game 6 on Ben Simmons 25th birthday
"&gt; If Devin Booker hits his average two or three three pointers tonight, Suns are looking at a game seven.  Or if Giannis ""Shaq"" Antetokounmpo shows up, rather than Giannis ""Steph"" Antetokounmpo.  Think about that, Giannis hit more 3pt shots than Booker this game and shot *90 fucking percent* from the line for nearly 20 shots.  This was a matter of the Bucks' best player putting up an absolute all-time legend of a performance on the same night Phoenix's best player(s) struggled."

"It also happened  after the Bucks were the first team before or since to be fined for ""tampering"" with their own player. So not so weird. https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/09/25/nba-fines-bucks-tampering-with-giannis-antetokounmpo-who-is-bucks/"
"Well considering we just win the last championship, I think we're at least in the conversation for next year. I also don't think you'll find a harder working young star than Giannis Antetokounmpo. Seriously, just go and listen to this guy's story, it's the ultimate rags-to-riches stories out there; so much so that Disney is making a movie out of it.  Our coaching is a little sus, but we are an elite defensive team that spaces the floor while Giannis drives to the paint."
"Here's the truth in the article below.  As racist the US may be toward Black people, most European counties are worse.  &gt;“He was given Greek citizenship in order to prevent him from traveling to New York as a Nigerian,” said Nikos Odubitan, the founder of Generation 2.0, an advocacy group that helps second-generation immigrants gain legal status in Greece.   &gt;   &gt;When Antetokounmpo was still an ordinary mortal, he was seen as just another migrant in Greece illegally.   https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/sports/giannis-antetokounmpo-greece.html"
"Lmao now say that without crying. Giannis Antetokounmpo, NBA Finals MVP."

Giannis “Dom Toretto” Antetokounmpo
This is why Giannis Antetokounmpo is the greatest Basketball player of all time.

I also want them to announce Giannis as Giannis “no skill” Antetokounmpo
Giannis Antetokounmpo was malnourished early in his career and couldn't do shit  Might as well have thrown out a newborn deer on the court
"In no particular order and assuming that they keep the original 50.   Lebron James   Kobe Bryant   Tim Duncan   Steph Curry   Kevin Durant   Dirk Nowitzki   Kevin Garnett   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Kawhi Leonard   James Harden   Dwyane Wade   Chris Paul   Steve Nash   Jason Kidd   Russell Westbrook   Allen Iverson   Gary Payton   Paul Pierce   Dwight Howard   Tracy McGrady   Dominique Wilkins   Anthony Davis   Carmelo Anthony   Damian Lillard   Bob MacAdoo"
"Because you can’t break the word down if you don’t know the spelling conventions of the language it comes from, even assuming that’s still how the individual pronounces it. Giannis has a Hellenized name that I can’t even find out if it is Igbo or Yoruba, and of the four languages Diakite speaks, you have to guess which spelling conventions reflect the proper pronunciation, assuming you’ve done that much background (it seems to be Fula). How do you handle the final “e” in Diakite, and the “gi” or “ounmpo” in Giannis Antetokounmpo? If you’re not familiar with Italian names, you can’t “break down” DiVincenzo and know that the “c”makes a /ch/ sound, and if you do know that you’re still making the assumption it hasn’t been anglicized to make an /s/ sound instead. Then you’ve also got a Georgian name and a Greek name. With no knowledge of the Greek language, how can you choose whether to put “tz” together into one sound, or break it up into a final /t/ at the end of one syllable, and an initial /z/ at the start of the next syllable?  TLDR: Languages use the same letters to represent varying sounds, so many NBA names are difficult to pronounce correctly if you’ve never heard them and aren’t familiar with that player’s background and language."
"For the same reason Marc Gasol was a 2nd round pick. By the way, the following players were picked around the same place or later:  * Giannis Antetokounmpo (15) * Manu Ginoblli (57) * Tony Parker (28) * Steve Nash (15) * Goran Dragic (45)  You might have heard about some of those names?"
"Let's just do this. I'll go through each team and tell you which players are better than Middleton.

If, as a matter of taste, you're adding people like Booker/Paul/Klay/Zion/Trae/Randle/Westbrook/Gobert ahead of him, cool - so he's like top 30 in that case.   Here's the general case for Middleton.  For the last 4 years, Middleton has given you 20/6/4 in an environment in which he is a) unable to get high-usage because Giannis is taking 33% of the teams' available shots and b) playing very good if not great defense. He's a 50/39/88 guy in that span on 15.4 FGA. Even in the lineups where Giannis is off the court and Middleton is on, the Bucks have been league average or better. Add to that the fact that he's above average to great at all shot distances with the exception of being a poor rim finisher (a role he is NEVER asked to play with Giannis on the team) and I think it's an easy argument to say he's a great player.   Let's compare him to Jimmy Buckets for a minute.   Last 4 seasons:   JB - 20/6/5 on 50/31/85 and 24.6% usage   KM - 20/6/4 on 50/39/88 and 25.2% usage  You might as well use the pam-same-image.jpg here. I'd take Jimmy here - he's a little more careful with the ball and his ability to get to the line makes him less variant. That said, it's close - we should absolutely be considering those two players as very near each other in skill level (and if someone said Jimmy Butler was a top-20, top-25 player nobody would bat an eye)."

"If he signs the 5year extension this summer (he’s a little busy right now in Tokyo) the extension would officially begin in October 2022 and last until June 2027. He would be eligible for ANOTHER 5 year extension in summer 2026. But he could tell the Mavericks he won’t sign the extension in 2026, much the way Anthony Davis told the Pelicans he wouldn’t sign an extension, and they traded AD to the Lakers. The Rose Rule Max extensions are intended to help the teams that drafted players keep them, not lose them to super teams. The best example is Giannis Antetokounmpo, who signed a rookie deal, a rookie extension, and now a 3rd contract with Milwaukee. Dame Lillard in Portland is another example. Giannis has won a Championship, Dame hasn’t. Both are with the teams that drafted them. One reason superstars leave is endorsements, they’re told they can earn more selling shoes/products in Ny&amp;LA, but in Luka’s case, his market is currently Europe, kids in Compton and Harlem aren’t buying his sneakers, but kids all through Europe are. So I don’t think his outside basketball earnings would increase if he leaves Dallas,"

"If you want team loyalty there's Damian Lillard and the Portland Trailblazers. He's arguably  the first player that pops up in my mind whenever I hear the word ""loyal"" in the NBA (mostly because he preaches it himself). Their history is also pretty respectable, they've had the Bill Walton days and their first ring, then moved on to the Clyde Drexler days, then the Oden - Aldridge - Roy days, and now the Damian Lillard era. Their social media team is good, they interact a lot with fans. Their organization is meh, their aim every season is to become a good playoff team with no championship aspirations (although now that Dame is demanding them to make moves for a championship). I would be really careful tho, there has been reports that Dame could want out of Portland so take that as you will.  Another team that screams loyalty is the Milwaukee Bucks. The history is composed of the Kareem days (one of the GOATs in basketball) winning their first championship, then to the Ray Allen days (late 90s to early 00s) and then to the Michael Redd era, then to the Brandon Jennings era. From then on, it has been downhill but their lives would change when they drafted their superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was once a Greek kid that came to America with literally nothing, and he was alone here, trying to carve a role here in the NBA. He has been through some absolute highs and lows with this Bucks team (at least from when he was a rookie up to now), and now he's one of the most beloved players in the league right now. They had 2 seasons of being contenders (one was where they kind of flopped after everyone expected them to win) and now he has carried the Bucks to its 2nd championship, along with Khris Middleton (another loyal guy who stuck with the Bucks together with Giannis) and Jrue Holiday (a guy they traded for). Their fan interaction is crazy, they have this running gag with player Bobby Portis where he's absolutely a fan favorite and they chant his name every game and stuff. They have a youtube channel where they show behind the scenes stuff (this is why i became a fan, i binged it all and they look so absolutely cool). Their org is also meh (but only recently they did good, they've done more sus moves like Kidd hiring and draft fuckups like DJ Wilson and Thon Maker).  Overall supporting these teams would be really fun especially the Bucks, since they all seem to be really chill."

"Shai, Murray, and Embiid don't count. They're not from Europe.  Out of all the active European players in the NBA right now, these are the best ones under 30: Antetokounmpo, Doncic, Jokic, Gobert, Sabonis, Porzingis, Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Schroeder, Valanciunas, Anunoby, Markkanen/Poeltl.  So your starters would be Luka, Bogdan, Sabonis, Giannis, Gobert. Best pieces off the bench would be Jokic, Vucevic, Anunoby, Schroeder, Valanciunas, Porzingis, Markkanen/Poeltl.  They'd go pound for pound against USA, with USA having better depth despite them having no real superstar.   \- That defense is obviously better tho (since their centers aren't turnstiles on D, plus they have better wing defenders too, Mikal and Murphy are gonna be so good), and they got good playmakers too (Young/Suggs/Mitchell/Booker can run an offense to an extent, we can put someone like Cade here if we want some playmaking).   \- USA got better shooters (duh), better perimeter defense (Europe's good defensive wings are Anunoby, Bogdan and Giannis, and even then Giannis isn't really an excellent on ball defender since he feasts on help defense; the rest are decent/average/bad) and USA, they're a jack of all trades master of none team (can do pretty much everything).   \- Europe could heavily depend on Luka PNR with Gobert/Giannis (Gobert hasn't developed an offensive game outside of catching lobs, and Giannis can run the PNR only when Gobert is off the floor since he clogs the paint) or Giannis drive &amp; kick (which can easily be countered since USA can just use the wall, they have the sizeable players with good defense that can set this up). They don't have that many catch and shoot guys, these guys are more creators of their own offense.  \- Porzingis is a shooting guard in a center's body, Sabonis, JV, Vucevic, and Jokic are bad at defense (but their offense is better than USA's), Markkanen has regressed since his rookie days, Poeltl hasn't shown much offensive upside yet but his defense is really good.  &amp;#x200B;  So take that as you will. I think I'm favoring US here, since they have the versatility on both ends of the floor. Defensively, Europe would heavily struggle if they needed stops but offensively they could outshoot team USA."
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."

"13% of the Bucks plays during the post season have been isolation plays. Clippers are at 14%, Hawks &amp; Suns at 7%  I take your point that it's more isolation than you'd like but pretending that's all they run is just facetious.  Budenholzer has always had a rep as a defensive coach.  Heres a good bit on the Bucks offensive improvements from the Miami series [clicky](https://behindthebuckpass.com/2021/05/28/milwaukee-bucks-mike-budenholzer-pushing-right-buttons-postseason/)  &gt;On the offensive end, we’ve seen the team play with much more structure and motion than a season ago. Rather than using Giannis Antetokounmpo as the primary ball handler on most possessions in the half-court, the Bucks have been increasingly using him more frequently as a screener or roller in pick-and-roll situations with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton.  &gt;The team has also been setting more off-ball screens away from the main play to create room for shooters and cutters. This has created more space for players to get open shots at the rim in the corners or above the break spots. This has especially benefited guys like Bryn Forbes, whose dynamic shooting ability has given the team something they sorely lacked in their past two post-season trips.  &gt;Three other areas that the Bucks have found success on offense is through their more aggressive ball movement, greater use of transition, especially in secondary transition opportunities and a clear intent to attack mismatches when they create them."

"Everybody was making fun of Harden when he made that statement. All it needed was one injured series from Antetokounmpo (2nd round in the Bubble vs the Heat) for people to start unironically believing it.   It was also the time that I realized that people don't watch basketball and their takes is merely espousing the general sentiment in regards to a player, nothing to do with the actual player often, merely what the populace thinks at the time because of some arbitrary reason or another (in that instance it was Antetokounmpo being booted in the 2nd round, injured or not didn't matter)...  I feel that Simmons is going through a similar period of undervaluation. Either now or in a few months from now he is probably bottoming out. If true his career will prolly ""explode"" from here (espec if he gets traded to a team that suits him), so I am buying some Simmons now (as I was buying some Giannis last year, if he does get the chip I will start selling some  Giannis for some more Simmons ... it's basically how you play the markets , go against the extreme sentiments)..."

"Ah yes, assists per game. The true measure of a PG. Surely not the result of not being a full-time PG or the fact that stats were suppressed because everybody in that league sucked.  [Here’s a draft profile from 2013](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1627273-giannis-adetokunbo-breaking-down-greek-phenoms-2013-nba-draft-stock). Seeing as you’ve clearly failed to look into his background at all I assume you won’t actually read it, so I’ll pick out the choice parts for you.  &gt; He's a small forward by nature, however his versatile skill set and reported 7'3'' wingspan should allow him to play multiple positions.  &gt; From what I saw during Filathlitikos' last game, Antetokounmpo isn't comfortable playing off the ball as a wing.  &gt; Many have been quick to point out that Antetokounmpo can play point guard, though at the NBA level that won't be his primary position. Many confuse the term ""ball-handler"" with point guard—just because one can handle the ball doesn't make him a point guard.  &gt; He probably won't be considered an NBA point guard, but his ability to create off the dribble will allow him to handle the ball in a secondary role.   His ability to be a ball handler was like the main thing that made him a unique prospect. Then there’s what Kidd said about him when we did have him running the offence:  &gt; ""We're going to go forward with him handling the ball,"" Kidd told reporters, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""You can call him point guard, point forward, point center, however you want to look at it.”  Which makes sense because he was only ever an actual starting PG when our guard rotation was short, when fully healthy he nominally played SF the whole time Kidd was here regardless of how much ball handling he was doing.  So yeah, Kidd used him pretty much exactly how people expected him to be used in a best-case scenario. Keep simping for a wife beater, though."
"&gt; A decade ago there was a very raw prospect with no collegiate experience who was pretty much awful as a rookie. This particular player was a negative BPM and had a PER of 10. That player was Giannis Antetokounmpo. Wiseman's numbers as a raw prospect are already much better.   I mean people should wait for Wiseman, he should be a good player in the future. But he isn't the player they need right now. Also you are comparing him to the player that had arguably the highest improvement throught his career that has ever played the game. He also was selected 15th in one of the worst drafts ever. The lottery picks from that year add up to 2 All-Star selections and 1 All-NBA 3rd team selection outside of Giannis. CJ must be the best player of the top 10."

"How many role players have to miss open three point shots in crucial moments in the playoffs for people to understand that these aren't the right plays, ESPECIALLY when it's a 3-PT shot.  There's a reason Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton get paid 86 million a year combined and Pat Connaughton gets paid 4 million, Connaughton isn't a great shooter and a 3 there is a mistake anyways.  Every time this situation comes up i always say this: If you are LeBron James or Giannis or whomever it is, you are giving the defense a favor when you pass to a role player in a crucial moment, that's EXACTLY what they want and that's why Kyle Korver or Danny Green or, in this case Pat Connaughton, is wide open. Part of what makes a great player a GREAT player is being reliable in clutch moments, that's not the same for a role player.  And before people ask ""But what about Jordan passing to Kerr?"", That was a two pointer right around the foul line, my opinion completely changes if its a layup or a WIDE OPEN 12 footer."

"Just to add on, he is not maybe the most versatile defender in the NBA, he actually is.

As a basketball fan and not just the Miami heat fan I'm loving this basketball season and the finals in each division I'm just hoping it ends up Phoenix (only because Miami boy James Jones is in the front office and built his team) and Milwaukee because they swept us the Miami heat and I don't want the whooping of our ass to be for nothing and I think giannis antetokounmpo is a good kid so that's my reasoning for the bucks. If those two teams make it then I think the bucks win it all and I think they actually deserve it because they have played Kick-Ass basketball all season.

Without realizing, though, he sent all of his cash across the Atlantic; that meant he couldn’t afford a return trip via taxi.  The Bucks had a game that night, though, so Antetokounmpo couldn’t take a leisurely stroll across Milwaukee. Instead, he started sprinting toward the Bradley Center. Fortunately for the Bucks, he only had to run about a mile; at that point, someone pulled over and offered the Greek Freak a ride to work.""

"[His Christianity](https://greekreporter.com/2019/07/23/how-a-greek-orthodox-priest-made-giannis-antetokounmpo-a-devout-christian/) apparently played a center role his early life:  Father Evangelos spoke to Ethnos newspaper about the character of the young basketball phenomenon, describing him as a young man with ethics who, unlike most of his peers, never held a grudge against society for his poverty. “I don’t remember him ever complaining or having a sense of being wronged by life and being aggressive towards society,” Father Evangelos recalled. “He may be flying on the court, but in real life I think he stands firmly on his feet.”"

Giannis is not the type of player to carry you into a championship. But then again who is lately?  Maybe Kawhi? But even him needed huge help from Lowry, FVV and Siakam. Certainly not LeBron in all his titles he had a solid #2. Curry maybe in 2015, but he had Klay (and Iggy and Dray).

"I don't think Crowder or Blake were particularly good on Antetokounmpo. Yeah, they get a few calls but generally they have an issue: too small.  It was Bam that gave the willies to Giannis last year and Ayton generally does as well. Basically guy of his body type. A bit below 7ft, long and strong. They generally play C (like Giannis would if not for his extreme agility and quickness)."

"Can confirm, was the starting PG on all my teams from ages 7-16, but I was 4’11” until my freshman year of High School so I called it quits.  I had a friend in elementary school who was hella tall; I mean, like probably 5’5 at 8 years old, and he kept growing and growing.. about that same time I quit, he was at least 6’8 probably taller. Stood over everyone in the school, even teachers.  Being so tall at such a young age he never played anything other than Center, so his footwork was trash, he couldn’t run fast, and every shot he took under the basket was 2-handed chucks at the backboard.   I told him, “hey man, you know you’re tall as fuck, and I’ve never seen anyone in this town over 6’6, you should play basketball. You would kick ass with some refinements. If you want I can work with you a little bit.”  That dudes name? ~~Giannis Antetokounmpo.~~   Sike.

"I honestly think if the Antetokounmpo bros (minus Giannis) focus on fundamentals for a couple years, they all should be able to become solid NBA role players. No doubt the hustle is there, but the basketball IQs need a boost."

"a 39 year old LeBron will not make a team an instant contender. If anything, the kid will get drafted in the hope of luring LeBron, sort of like the Antetokounmpo brothers keep getting jobs so that Giannis will remember which teams treated his family well. Or when the Knicks have guaranteed money to JR Smith’s brother."
"It's starting to look like he's lost his spot on our team but he's not nearly as bad as our sub treats him.   His biggest problem is that he's too passive. If a team can get him to come out of his shell consistently he could be a nice rotation piece.   ***  **Shooting:**   From a 3P shooting standpoint, he was as accurate and as frequent as Jae Crowder was for us over his last 2 seasons in Boston, he just played a smaller role.    | 3P%| 3PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi| 36.7 | 6.0 Jae (2015-17) | 36.9| 5.9   The issue is Jae scored a lot more off everything else. He was a much better cutter and more active scorer overall. Semi is too passive outside of his shooting.     | 2P%| 2PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi | 49.2| 2.4 Jae (2015-17)| 53.4| 6.0  ***  **Defence:**   Semi has an incredible defensive body: 6'6, 240lbs, good vert, great lateral quickness, good wingspan, absurd strength and a lot of that strength is in his lower body.    You'll legitimately see power forwards bounce off him. He's the immovable object we often play when dealing with an unstoppable force.   Last season we had a good example against the Knicks. Randle was getting to the rim at will powering through everyone on our roster. We subbed in Semi. Randle bounced off Semi once or twice. Randle stopped trying to drive towards the rim.    The issue again is his passiveness. He's too much of a gentle giant. He's great at using his strength to absorb contact, but he doesn't use that strength to bully anyone.  You see it in the stats, he has a low foul rate (considering the role we have him in) but he just doesn't take any risks [\(eg. 0 blocks all season\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ndzqlt/semi_ojeleye_finished_the_season_with_zero_0/)   ***   **Culture:**  You're not going to get anyone less drama-prone. His workouts are the most famous thing about him:   &gt; It sounded like a sledgehammer was hitting behind Al Horford's locker stall inside TD Garden and Boston’s veteran big man can feel the reverberations as he puts on his shoes. But Horford just smiles and shakes his head. &gt;  &gt; “I have a lot of faith in those concrete walls,” said Horford. &gt;  &gt; Boom. &gt;  &gt; These loud thuds became a familiar white noise in the Celtics locker room after games this season. But, by late April, it felt like the noise was getting louder. Marcus Morris’ stall is a safe distance from the epicenter but even he couldn't help but notice the decibel level.  &gt;  &gt; “Shem, god damn,” said Morris.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Further across the room, Terry Rozier heard the noise but always figured it was just part of the perpetual construction happening around the Garden. Gordon Hayward, who is as far from the pounding as possible, was more aware of what was happening in the adjoining weight room.   &gt;...  &gt;Those booms were a medicine ball that Ojeleye had repeatedly launched into a wall as part of a CrossFit-like routine that Celtics rehab and performance coordinator Zach Markowitz had designed for Ojeleye on nights he doesn’t get into game action.  &gt;https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/semi-ojeleyes-wall-rattling-workouts-have-readied-him-giannis-antetokounmpo   So if you want someone who's just going to turn up and work without stepping on anyone's toes, that's Semi in a nutshell. But you're not going to hear reports about him holding players accountable or taking a vocal role in the locker room.   ***  The big issue with Semi is that he just doesn't do enough to justify a roster spot atm. It's not an abundance of lowlights that holds him back, it's a lack of highlights.  You'd be happy with everything he provides, if only he was providing more.  Put him on a team like Brooklyn where Harden can feed him corner 3s and he'll have vets like Green (and potentially Tucker) pushing him to be more aggressive defensively and maybe he could be a really nice piece."
They are not. They just beat the Brooklyn nets because Giannis antetokounmpo stumped on Kyrie Irving's foot so let's get that straight. Luck just ran on their side
"Personally, the Giannis-Ayton matchup in the post is too much work. The best tactic would be to attack the guard pair and force the rest of the team to win without them. If Giannis makes an effort to attack CP3 and Booker he'll have no less than a 6 inch height advantage everytime, and paired with defense from Holiday and Middleton will take a toll on those 2. Giannis will also be able to guard Ayton appropriately, Ayton has been incredible but the only defensive big of this caliber was AD who was injured during the first round. I don't think Giannis will be able to hold him perfectly, but he has the size and speed to keep up with him in a way that Jokic and Batum were not able to. It's also worth saying that putting Giannis at the 4 would be effective looking at potential match-ups of Dario Saric and Jae Crowder. Crowder is an elite defender who was able to put a dent in Lebron's production, but he will be giving up 5 inches of height, and cannot match Giannis' athletic ability.   On another note, P.J. Tucker will play a massive role on defense, he'll be able to guard 1-4 against this Phoenix team. With his performance against Kevin Durant, we can say with some certainty that he would be able to effectively guard someone like Booker, who is likely still feeling pain from his broken nose and who is the same size as P.J.  Some problems I see for the Bucks lie in the bench unit. Players like Brook Lopez, Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton may find themselves attacked by CP3's prodding offense. Taking advantage of Lopez's slow feet and lack of ability to close the distance on the mid range shot. This also applies to Booker, who will have the added benefit of size against Pat and Forbes. The Suns will likely be match-up hunting against this Milwaukee team and working to rotate the star defenders away from star offensive players. Defensively, I'm not sure what the Suns will be able to do. Bridges, Paul and Crowder are defensively diverse starters that can be swapped and changed around nearly interchangeably, so they will have an incredible amount of options to work through on the defensive end.   Ultimately, some key match-ups for this series will probably be  - Ayton vs Antetokounmpo   - Paul vs Holiday  - Booker vs Middleton  - Payne vs Teague  Especially without Giannis, Phoenix has an excellent opportunity to win this championship looking at the depth and versatility of their lineup. Barring injury, I expect Phoenix will take this series in 6-7 games."
"Almost every star this playoff got injured though, especially on the teams they faced.  You saying almost every team built a team of injury prone players?  Anthony Davis,  Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Jaylen Brown  I mean even Chris Paul got hurt, and Booker broke his nose.  Those are just the guys who would be considered stars."

He was initially diagnosed as having a head contusion and returned to the game.  &gt; The Bucks said Monday that ""team physicians followed league protocols and consulted the league's neurologist during the evaluation periods"" during Saturday's game and that Antetokounmpo ""passed his neurological tests that created significant doubt that it was a concussion."" On Monday, Antetokounmpo reported new symptoms and a lingering headache.  Giannis later reported not having a memory of what happened."
"Lol Barkley is clamouring for Lopez to play inside because he’s a boomer who is obsessed with post play because that was common when he played. Lopez playing inside more would not have been the solution to Milwaukee’s playoff struggles, especially on a team with Giannis “I can’t shoot for dick” Antetokounmpo on the team. This obsession with playing out of the post needs to stop. It’s not worth it for pretty much anyone except Jokic, Embiid, and in-game mismatches."

"&gt; that's why nobody said that  People are literally saying it here and on Twitter. Do you want me to start collecting quotes for you? I don't write things in vain.  &gt; Ok and how many bigs handle the ball like he does playing point forward and slashing?   And how many Cs are handling the ball and are the primary playmaker? One , Jokic. Nobody is calling him anything other than a C.  Giannis is a big PF or a small C, closer to what Duncan was (position wise, not playing style wise) in his career. When the Spurs would play Timmy with Robinson nobody would think that Timmy was a regular PF playing alongside a C. They would call them the twin towers Spurs.   Of course they had reasons to play like that and it (mostly) worked for them. I just don't see how it works for the Bucks is all I am saying. You severely limit Lopez by playing him alongside another big.  &gt; Ben Simmons  Have you watched Ben Simmons play, like ever? Guy is mediocre scorer inside, he is way better guarding the perimeter than Giannis way worse guarding the rim, he is nowhere near the rebounder that Giannis is. He is an entirely dissimilar player to Giannis Antetokounmpo, he is a perimeter player with a big body, Giannis is a big with some perimeter talents..."

"&gt;If every possession you dribbled for 22 seconds then passed to a contested shot you would probably average 30 assists a game, but your team would get destroyed.  No, you wouldn't.  The all-time record for team assists per game is 30.1.  &gt;I'm that situation an assist is not valuable. Having watched Schroder for an entire season I strongly feel his assists are of those nature. He struggles to make the correct play and kisses obvious passes. His assists are a result of how ouch he handles the ball.  Then how did he average more assists than any secondary ball-handlers except Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and the 3-headed assist monster in Indiana?  The answer is that you are just wrong."
"I can. The Bucks never went after Harden and they consulted with Giannis.   &gt;ESPN’s Brian Windhorst ($$) reports that the Bucks had an “internal conversation” about possibly pursuing the MVP. This included running the idea by Giannis Antetokounmpo before they pulled the plug on their pursuit  &gt;According to The Athletic’s Sam Amick ($$), the Bucks did not see Harden as a “cultural fit""  for their roster as currently constructed. The guard has made a handful of headlines this offseason for his off-court decision making, which has been one of the prominent reasons why Milwaukee, along with several other franchises, have been hesitant to make a move for him.  https://behindthebuckpass.com/2020/12/31/giannis-antetokounmpo-rumors-bucks-asked-james-harden-trade/  Funny how you posted something as fact when evidence says otherwise 🤷‍♂️"
"&gt;Giannis wanted to play with harden/cp3 but they exhausted all their assets on jrue so this makes 0 sense   Source? They never even considered CP3 well before the Jrue trade happened. With some indications that Giannis didn't want the Bucks to pursuit it.   &gt;As for the reported prospect of the Bucks pursuing Oklahoma City point guard Chris Paul as a possible solution to the roster deficiencies, sources with knowledge of ownership’s thinking said it is highly unlikely. The cost of bringing him aboard — Paul is owed $41.3 million next season and has a player option worth $44.2 million in the 2021-22 campaign — and the potential difficulty of bringing Paul onto a roster already led by a strong personality in Antetokounmpo seems to limit the chances of the Bucks moving to pair the two All-Stars. All indications are that the Bucks would rather look elsewhere"
"&gt;pay Schroder $25m and you'll never sniff the Finals again  Secondary ball-handlers who averaged more than Schroder's 5.8 assists: Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Malcolm Brogdon, and Domantas Sabonis.  Only 25 players of any description averaged more assists, and that despite Schroder playing a good chunk of his minutes with offensive talent like Matthews and Morris.  If they let Schroder walk, they won't win anything.  While I'd rather not pay him $25m, that actually makes no difference except to the Buss Family bank account, since they are over the cap anyway.  They will be better with Schroder -- at any price -- than with whoever they could sign to replace him."
"&gt;This year it was back down to 54% which is quite bad but still above his own average.  League median is only 57%.  Schroder could obviously be more efficient, but managing even 54% in their ""system"" this season was not bad.  Vogel has no offensive ideas beyond ""Isolate James and watch him"", ""Isolate Davis and let him shoot fadeaways"", and pick-and-rolls.  Everything else was just freelancing, like on a playground.  So for a good chunk of the season, Schroder was out with some combination of Wesley Matthews, Markieff Morris, Andre Drummond, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Caldwell-Pope and they were just making up whatever.  They were completely dependent on Schroder's ability to break down a defense and make something good happen, which he often did.  Even surrounded by that largely questionable offense, Schroder averaged 5.8 assists -- which is 26th in the League, and more than all but a couple secondary ball-handlers.  The very impressive company he's in there is: Steph Curry, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."

"*Finally, the last minute of the game*, thought Jimmy Butler as he received a quick inbound from his trusty big, Bam Adebayo. *This is where I excel.*      Jimmy dribbled down the court and glanced around at the mass of Heat fans cheering his name. He smirked and reached towards a small sack tied around his waist by a simple string. He dug his hand into the plump pouch and grab a hand full of its contents.      *South Beach sand.* He takes it everywhere he goes. Jimmy, while dribbling, brought the sand to his nose and wafed the smell. Ah yes! That smell! He could sense the gulf shore breeze in each granule. It was the perfect smell to remind him of his destiny, to be one with Heat culture. He dreamt of this moment.       He ritualistically blew the sand out of his palm and all over the NBA court; the crowd went **wild**. Jimmy then began squaring up his defender, Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Milwaukee Bucks. Giannis was a large man, that was certainly the case, but Giannis lacked one critical factor.      *Tyler Herro.* Jimmy quickened his moves. Right, left, right, left. Giannis had no chance. Butler approached the 3-point line and whipped the ball over to Herro, ready at the corner for the 3.       Routine catch-and-shoot from one of the bubble’s biggest breakout stars, Herro collected the pass with style and immediately jumped for the release. He flicked his iced wrist; tiny South Beach sand grains sprinkled out from underneath his fingernails.      *An S-tier release*, noticed Jimmy Butler. He gazed as the ball achieved a beautiful arc over the Bucks’ defense. Jimmy turned and began his shift to defense. *Herro had too much drip to miss--*      Clank!      Jimmy spun around to see that the ball had smacked the front of the rim and was hurtling toward him. He nabbed the ball, eyeing the shot clock. 14 seconds. They were down by 1. He squared up Giannis again. The sand he had previously blown onto the court was now crunching underneath his shoes. *Down to the wire*.   Sure, It was surprising to see that Herro had missed, but it didn’t matter anyway. The Heat just needed to bring Jimmy to the playoffs. They needn’t worry. He’ll handle the rest.      He darted towards the basket, worming his way around Giannis. Bucks’ center Brook Lopez slid into the lane. Jimmy juked outside, spun, and jumped. A mid-range attempt.      *I’m stupidly locked in.*      \[Game Ended. Milwaukee Bucks Defeat Miami Heat 4-0 in series sweep\]"
Giannis “Draymond Green” Antetokounmpo
"Giannis Antetokounmpo has averaged 41.5 points, 10.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists against the Nets this year, FYI."
"“So in Kigali, there were scouts in the stands from around the globe, poised to find the next Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid or Pascal Siakim.”  Hmmm, one of these is not like the other…  Great story, though."
"Antetokounmpo brothers easy, u got giannis and then four mini-me versions of him"

"&gt; This is the hot take stuff I shy away from  My point is that pre injury KD could stand his own against someone like Giannis. Yeah, the guy is a back to back MVP and cannot be stopped when he is on. However KD (along with Simmons and a few others) could contain him to a point.  If you watched KD after his injury that's all but gone. He shies away from contact, he is nowhere the rim protector he was and generally his physicality has suffered quite a lot. Yeah, he is an elite scorer and Achilles injury does not make you ""forget"" your scoring instincts, but it does make you a less well rounded player than before.  KD can score surprisingly well for someone returning from such a serious injury. Still he is nowhere near the Warriors KD on important aspects of the game.  And again, he ""only"" had to deal with the Achilles injury. Add to that the ACL derived mental block (the knee feels unstable for quite longer than many realize, even if it is fully healed) and I honestly don't know how Klay could be the kind of contributor that would seriously move  the needle.  Again, it is extremely rare to be getting those two injuries back to back. Boogie cousins is the only other (semi) recent example we have and he is seriously on his way out of the league.  Different kinds of players, yes. However Klay was an extremely physical player as well.  Maybe -as you said- standin on the corner shooting would be beneficial over someone who can't do even that. But you have to also consider how !uch of a liability such a player is defensively. How he would always be attacked (a bit of KD was attacked when matched up against Antetokounmpo) and I'm just not sure if his offensive production would offset him being attacked on the defensive end, all the time.  I guess we have to wait and see. After Klay's injury I predicted that these Warriors won't make the playoffs. Now, again, I am predicting that Klay's return on its own won't move the needle. Steph says ""you don't want to see us next year,"", implying they will be good. Allow me to have my doubts.  I think home advantage is a stretch (it can't / won't happen), however a playoff admission *may* happen, however it would be a battle and I would not be surprised (at all) if they miss the playoffs for a 3rd time in a row.  Injuries suck, we agree. But in fact (let me add) that they such *because* of how deep their Ramifications run. Look today's LAL vs last year's. They went from serious contenders to ones hoping that they wont be a first round exit. All because of injuries..."

"&gt;“And the winner projected by PerThirtySix is: Nikola Jokić!  &gt;Jokić has put up a phenomenal season and the Nuggets finishing strong has put some distance between him and the closest contenders: Giannis Antetokounmpo and **Joel Embiid**. If Embiid had played the same number of games as Jokić while maintaining his level of production, our model has this coming down to the wire. But, as it stands, Jokić is the clear-cut favorite.”  I’m interested why Dame is third and not Embiid? The article itself even states embiid is third in their predictions as it stands now, so I’m just a little confused."
"Interesting question, but why is Mike Budenholzer and Giannis Antetokounmpo what I’m looking at? Couldn’t find a shot of Terry and Dame?"
"sure but you know we're also living in the time of LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, quite possibly Luka Doncic and Chris Paul and we also saw Kobe Bryant.  Fuck if Steph weren't around Klay Thompson would be getting discussed as the GOAT shooter."
"Also shout out to the next few up if you drop to .290... None of whom are quite in the same GOAT conversation, but still damn impressive. And for Robinson, Durant and CP3, their names are littered throughout the top 50.  * David Robinson (93-94) - .2960 * Kevin Durant (13-14) - .2955 * Connie Hawkins (68-69) - .2930 * Chris Paul (08-09) - .2925 * Giannis Antetokounmpo (18-19) - .2922  [bbref WS/48](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws_per_48_season.html)"
"If Nikola Jokic wins, he'd be the first MVP from Serbia. It would be the second time that consecutive MVP winners are not born in the continental United States. First time that happened was Steve Nash (2005, 2006) and Dirk Nowitzki (2007).  Nikola would also be the 6th MVP not born in the continental United States, joining Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria), Tim Duncan (US Virgin Islands), Steve Nash (born in South Africa to British parents but raised in Canada), Dirk Nowitzki (Germany), Giannis Antetokounmpo (born in Greece to Nigerian parents)."

"The NBA investigates if another team files a formal complaint (which reportedly happened in this case). The early reporting was enough to reportedly generate a formal complaint from another team which led to the investigation. The league then investigated and likely found their own evidence, not just relying on the report.  The difference with that deal that attracted so much more attention for complaints from other teams was that it was a sign-and-trade. In order for the teams to agree to the sign-and-trade, tampering had to have occurred (otherwise a trade can't be done). In ""regular"" FA signings, teams can tamper and get away with it without leaving evidence because they can just communicate (quietly) through back channels and pretend the deal happened one minute after it was allowed to. The sign-and-trade was what made that instance particularly obvious and it's just like I said in the original comment - if you're going to break a rule, do it quietly (and don't create larger transactions around your illegal one, involving more parties and drawing more attention to it). It's the difference between robbing a bank and hiding the money to spend later vs robbing a bank and then immediately buying a new car with a dufflebag full of cash down the street.  &gt;Late that Monday evening, just minutes after the agreement was struck, word reached the news media of Milwaukee and Sacramento's intended sign-and-trade. And during the board of governors' call on Tuesday, several league sources indicated that Bucks governor Marc Lasry stopped just short of bragging about Milwaukee's impressive Monday evening of transactions. However, multiple league personnel participating on the call said they did not remember any Bucks official gloating or any noted behavior or conversation out of the ordinary.  &gt;[Either way, at least one rival team filed a formal complaint](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2919681-inside-the-botched-sign-and-trade-that-could-send-giannis-antetokounmpo-packing)"

Doctors can easily also tell if your growth plates are still open. So nba teams draft with that in mind if they player gives their medical information.  Here’s a 2013 article about Giannis https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-isnt-done-growing-physically/
Notable forwards who are likely All-NBA candidates during MPJ's contract:  * Julius Randle  * Jayson Tatum * Brandon Ingram * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Kevin Durant * Jimmy Butler * Paul George * Domantas Sabonis  He's obviously an offensive juggernaut (his monthly splits in the last 2 months of the season speaks for itself) although is he going to put up those same numbers when Murray is back. The ability isn't being questioned but more so the amount of opportunities to put up All-NBA numbers.

"Yup, good thing Kareem called the NBA stars out for it, since he's a respected authority who they might listen to, as opposed to say management or random fans on the Internet.  &gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has been out here. The 74-year-old got his first Moderna shot on camera with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He appeared in an early public-service announcement for the vaccine on behalf of the NBA. And he’s been calling out anti-vax celebrities like Nicki Minaj from Twitter to his new Substack. But the league continues to have difficulty convincing current superstars to advocate for vaccines: An NBA source says league officials could still ask LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo to appear in a PSA, but would never press the faces of its business to go there. As Black Americans continue to get vaccinated at a slower rate than any other race or ethnicity measured by the CDC, Abdul-Jabbar says that players who remain silent about the vaccine are no longer legitimate role models.  &gt;&gt; “They are failing to live up to the responsibilities that come with celebrity. Athletes are under no obligation to be spokespersons for the government, but this is a matter of public health,” the Hall-of-Famer writes Rolling Stone in an e-mail. Abdul-Jabbar is especially disappointed in athletes of color: “By not encouraging their people to get the vaccine, they’re contributing to these deaths. I’m also concerned about how this perpetuates the stereotype of dumb jocks who are unable to look at verified scientific evidence and reach a rational conclusion.”"

"hmm… is it though?

It’s just amazing that his coaches seemingly never got him in a strength program and had him start lifting weights like Michael Jordan.   As for playing drunk… I didn’t know that lol, I guess a guy who showed up to games drunk wouldn’t exactly be doing a ton of fitness work at the gym!"

They faced each other a total of 14 times in NBA games. Rudy Gobert has a 11-3 winning record over Giannis Antetokounmpo.
"I did not say Gobert is not top 10 simply because his team lost.  I explained that players who are top 10 with the Jazz roster would take it to the Finals. The Jazz roster against last years Western Conference was enough for Embiid or AD on to get them out of the West last year. Their inside presence offensively would be so dominant with the ball handling and shooting around them and they can also serve as quality defensive anchors while being a bit better on the perimeter.   Gobert does not provide enough on the offensive to cover for flaws that a roster may have. Luka also took the clippers WITH kawhi to 7 with a worse roster than Utah and without very good perimeter defense. And those are the 3 guys ranked in the bottom of the top 10.  Also LeBron's Cavs team was also much much much worse than the Jazz roster which literally has another all-star and top 25 player next to Gobert. Lebron, literally made the Finals though. That's so much more than not ever getting past the second round lol.  But Who is Rudy Gobert better than out of these guys? Because that's the only conversation that matters when talking about top 10.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis.  I think there's seasons around 2013-2015 where Gobert these past two seasons could have been top 10 but he's not in this current NBA."

"Speaking of which, here's a fun fact: The #12 pick in the 2013 draft is one of the most important threads in modern NBA history. That pick originally belonged to the Toronto Raptors. They traded it to Houston in a package to acquire Kyle Lowry.  Houston then sent that pick to OKC in a package to acquire James Harden.  OKC were holding on to that pick and had their eyes firmly set on Steve Adams in the 2013 draft. Meanwhile, Masai Ujiri was making a big run at trying to get that pick back from OKC. The reason: He was desperate to draft Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Had one of the 11 teams picking before OKC nabbed Steven Adams, chances are OKC would have accepted a trade to send that pick back to Toronto, and Giannis would have been a Raptor.  One innocent pick in the middle of the draft got Toronto the greatest raptor of all time in Kyle Lowry, got Houston one of the greatest Rockets of all time in James Harden, and secured Milwaukee one of the greatest Bucks of all time in Giannis Antetokounmpo."
"Their beef started when Giannis won MVP over Harden and he acted like a sore loser. He did the same to Westbrook, a guy who was supposedly his friend.  Harden after Giannis won MVP in 2019: I had a [season] for the books, but it’s out of my control. Once the media creates that narrative about one person for the beginning of the year, I think they just run with that narrative until the end of the year. I don’t want to get into details but all I can do is control what I can do and I did what I was supposed to do at a high level.  Harden in an interview with GQ when asked about Giannis: You can’t tell me that a guy whose team was a 14-seed at one point last year, and ended up a four-seed with everything that was going on—so many injuries—and who went on a 32-game 30-point streak, eight 50-point games, two 60-point games in one season … and all the talk was about [Giannis Antetokounmpo]? There’s no way.  So I feel like Giannis definitely had a reason to feel disrespected and took a couple jokey jabs in response."

Kawhi's is bigger by [3/4 of an inch](https://youtu.be/K8FKTYuKUuI?t=5). Kawhi's shoulders are what separate them his are incredibly broad."
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."

"i really hope Masai trades for him.   but to your point, if a guy is 8-26 or 5-23 then Ben did his job.   If the eye test looks off it's maybe b/c you don't know what you are looking at.   Trae is a PnR savant.  nobody shuts it down.  But forcing him to do things he might not want to do like rushing floaters from his non preferred spots made it a hard time.     small guards are his weakest areas, b/c dude is 6-11.   but for the most part he hangs with them just fine and causes problems.   https://thesixersense.com/2021/03/01/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-defensive-games/  &gt;Dec. 29, Sixers vs. Raptors — Pascal Siakam Siakam Stats – 7:02 mins | 7 pts |  3-11 FG |  0-0 FT | 0 ast | 1 TO  Simmons Stats – 1 stl | 1 blk  Siakam had some success against other Sixers’ defenders but couldn’t do much against Simmons. Six of Siakam’s field goal attempts against Simmons were 3s, most of which were Siakam settling instead of trying to attack the rim. Siakam had very little success the few times he tried to drive on Simmons as well. Ben is one of the few defenders in the NBA who has both the size and speed to cover Siakam, and it showed in this game.  maybe you prefer a homer article showing how much trouble he gives your squad's best player  https://www.raptorshq.com/2020/2/27/21155484/pascal-siakam-defense-stoppers-giannis-antetokounmpo-ben-simmons-bam-adebayo  or maybe you want to see more about him vs other star wings  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/ben-simmons-nba-all-star-game-2020-analysis  &gt;While those numbers are all mighty impressive, the job he’s done just manning people up has been nothing short of stellar. When you look at the All-Star caliber players Simmons has defended this season, he’s kept them all in check. Jimmy Butler (3 of 12), Jayson Tatum (3 of 11), Pascal Siakam (5 of 19), Bradley Beal (6 of 14), LeBron James (2 of 9), Russell Westbrook (4 of 13) and James Harden (3 of 9) have shot a combined 26 of 87.

[No. Neither was Steph.](https://www.nba.com/news/nikola-jokic-giannis-antetokounmpo-stephen-curry-lead-2020-21-all-nba-first-team)
"Why should we not? LeBron is better all around, he doesn't have to be (remembered) as better than an inside specialist (when it comes to inside scoring). If anything I would be surprised if Giannis doesn't end up remembered as better than LeBron inside.   Reading this sub you'd think guy is some second rate peripheral all star. Truth of the matter very few in the history of the game took teams as perennially bad as the Bucks and turned them into perennial , even pseudo contenders (if they are that). Milwaukee is the backwater of Basketball, no much better than Cleveland in fact, if Giannis gets them a title, just one, he would be remembered as one of the all time greats, like top 30 kind of great.   So yeah ofc I will compare a guy in as a high trajectory with LeBron in some aspects of his game. Nobody is telling that Giannis will ever develop the shooting or playmaking of the top 2 player in the whole of basketball history, but it not at all absurd to expect him to match even surpass him during the cource of his career when it comes to inside sscoring. Again in fact it would not at all be a surprise, Antetokounmpo is developing in quite the behemoth when it comes to inside scoring, one that will be remembered in a similar tier like the Shaqs or Wilts of this world..."

&gt;Tim Duncan   &gt;**GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO**  &gt;KG/Dirk  &gt;Malone  &gt;Barkley  &gt;McHale  &gt;Hayes  2 MVPs + DPOY already puts him ahead of everyone in individual achievements.  Add a Championship &amp; FMVP to that WITH a small market team that he was drafted to is pretty fucking special.  If he gets 2 more titles I’d even consider putting him ahead of Duncan which I never thought I’d ever say.
"Here is an attempt at putting the article here. There are videos with surrounding text so I cut those and the surrounding text. Sorry if some of it doesn't make sense.  One trend that has perhaps been underdiscussed in these always-evolving NBA Finals: The Milwaukee Bucks are one win from the title in large part because their offense has been really, really good.  The Bucks in the Finals have poured in 117.7 points per 100 possessions, a mark that would have edged the Brooklyn Nets for No. 1 in the regular season. The ugliness of some of Milwaukee's meandering half-court possessions obscures how lethal this team can be when it gets rolling.  The easiest path to that is to not play in the half court at all, and a big theme in this series has been Milwaukee's ability to get out in transition. The Bucks aren't running quite as often as they did in the regular season -- when they played in transition more than any team, per Cleaning The Glass -- but they are still doing so at an above-average rate, and that's a win considering the Phoenix Suns were among the very best at keeping teams out of transition.  And the Bucks are scoring just about every time they hit the open floor: 152.9 points per 100 transition chances, according to Cleaning The Glass. The No. 1 team in the regular season by that measure finished at 133.8. Yowza. This is one of the subtler ways Phoenix's lack of size hurts. Deandre Ayton is the only guy in the Suns' rotation even resembling a big man, and he plays near the rim on offense -- meaning he is rarely back early as a deterrent. No other Sun can make Giannis Antetokounmpo at full throttle pause to think for one second.  The Suns have been a little lax with their floor balance and ball control, but the Bucks are opportunistic; they hunt transition chances with constant urgency.  Behind some hot shooting and smart adjustments from Mike Budenholzer in Game 5, Milwaukee's half-court offense -- its weak spot in past playoffs -- is up to about league-average production for the series, per Cleaning The Glass. The Bucks doing that against one of the league's nastiest half-court defenses is almost cause for a parade.  Milwaukee brutalizing Phoenix on the offensive glass has boosted that half-court scoring figure by turning some initially listless possessions into points. Milwaukee has needed all this offense, because the Suns have scored 115.5 points per 100 possessions -- a hair below their sixth-ranked figure in the regular season. Their effective field goal percentage for the series would have ranked No. 2 behind the Nets; it bumped even higher over Games 3, 4, and 5 -- all Phoenix losses. Phoenix is shooting the bejesus out of it.  The Suns have had to, because, as I noted before Game 5, the Bucks have methodically turned this series into a math problem the Suns can't win. The possession battle is a rout for the Bucks. They are getting more offensive boards and free throws. And their defense is scrunching the Suns' offense toward the midrange to a dangerous extreme. Phoenix is getting to the rim at a league-worst rate, and it has attempted just 30 corner 3s -- six per game, down from its regular-season average of 10. Seventeen of those 30 came in Game 2. In the four other games, the Bucks have basically erased the corners from the court.  It's great and not super shocking that Phoenix is shooting so well; the Suns consciously built around two elite shot-makers in Devin Booker and Chris Paul. It's not great that the Suns have to shoot well -- and almost preposterously well -- to have any chance to win. The Bucks have a margin for so-so shooting; the Suns don't.   Starting in Game 3, the Bucks have found the right mix of defenses to make the Suns uncomfortable. When Brook Lopez is on the floor, the Bucks play a slightly more aggressive version of their base pick-and-roll defense: Lopez ventures out to deter an easy jumper, but not so high as to approximate any sort of trap. He has mostly been able to stay in front of Booker and Paul, and then pivot back to Ayton in time to meet Ayton outside the block-charge circle -- forcing tough hooks and floaters.  The Suns might be able to find traction getting even more creative with where Ayton sets his picks -- sometimes close to midcourt; sometimes at the foul line. (Ayton is also smart about flipping the direction of his pick at the last second.) Booker might benefit from more instant head-down driving, and less pulling back to map the floor. Regardless: Lopez has hung in since the Bucks ditched Game 1's switch-heavy gambit.  When Lopez is off the floor, the Bucks switch everything. They don't seem all that concerned with handing Booker or Paul the Pat Connaughton matchup both are seeking. An adjustment in how Milwaukee's other four defenders react when the Suns get Connaughton on an island is one reason the Bucks have flipped the momentum in these Finals.  One Milwaukee tweak was to stop switching with Lopez. Connaughton at least has a shot of sticking close enough to Paul and Booker as to not require emergency help -- or at least not inspire the fear in his teammates that such help might be required.  It's easy to say Phoenix should spice things up instead of getting bogged down in isolation basketball: keep moving, set more ball screens, run split actions off the ball (when two teammates screen for each other and veer off in random directions), and continue with its sets as if facing a normal defense and not a switch-everything vise grip. The Suns should do all those things!  But elite switching defenses have a way of squeezing that verve out of you -- of making all that motion seem pointless and exhausting.  Milwaukee's offense has had euphoric ups and troubling swoons in the Budenholzer era, including in these playoffs, but its defense has been constant. If the Bucks have a mediocre scoring night after a sizzling first five games, that defense might be good enough to carry them across the finish line."
