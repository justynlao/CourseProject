"Second round picks are pretty useless in the NBA outside the top few spots where you can catch a legit first round talent who dropped.  But by picks 40-something or 50-something you're literally getting a player who is absolutely no better than dozens of undrafted guys.  Like, Celtics snagged Sam Hauser right after the draft and signed him immediately to a two-way.  Hauser could have very easily been drafted just about anywhere in the second round."
Aaron Nesmith and Sam Hauser beg to differ
"For the Celtics Yam Madar, Juhann Begarin, and Sam Hauser are also notable  Yam Madar especially"
yam mader for sure. also sam hauser because im ready to overreact to a few good games and imagine him to be duncan robinson 2.0 much like i had visions of carsen edwards becoming steph-lite two years ago. having hope is always fun.
sam “doogie” hauser
Sam Hauser 2nd round sleeper imo absolutely deadly outside shooter can have a long career off that alone.

"Duncan Robinson happens once in a hundred times.  Besides, Duncan was a 42% 3-point shooter in college in a power conference.  Mathews was a 37% 3-point shooter on a low end D-1 team.  Huge difference.  Not to mention the size disparity.     Plus the Celtics already have a much more realistic Duncan Robinson candidate in Sam Hauser who is a lights out shooter at 6'8."

"It's okay, we have Sam Hauser now. [He's like Hayward-lite](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/px9hu9)."
"It was Sam Hauser. First time in an NBA game so I can't say I really blame him for taking a wide open 3, I think Udoka pulled everyone out a bit early more than anything tbh"
Sam Hauser  Bol Bol  Saben Lee  Usman Garuba  Yves Pons  Paul Reed  Jalen Smith  Joe Wieskamp (should not be on a two-way)  Malachi Flynn
