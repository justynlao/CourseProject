Hey Warriors fans get this man Andrew Wiggins to all star
No way he deserves. The guy was a number 1 pick and we wanna give him most improved for 19 points a game? He sucks on defense and only seems better because the warriors have great team defense. Therr are atleast 30 players who deserve it more. How about juluis randle? Chris woods? Sorry I just really don't think Andrew wiggins is in the conversation
"yeah, it's the statnerds that don't care for him. i like him as a guy, sure, but I do think his value to a team is pretty overrated due to shot selection. its not like anyone thinks he's Andrew wiggins, he's just not giving you ""Superstar"" output for his contract.  i think most people would consider him a superstar and someone like DeRozan a star at best, but I think they're pretty similar players really."
Andrew wiggins type pokemon
Damn Wiggins is real teammate  Oubre having a stinker and Andrew be like dont worry fam I'll ride with you lmao
Oubre is what Andrew Wiggins was last year.aka the worst contract in the league
Andrew Wiggins is a ball stopper.  Pass the ball.  If it‚Äôs not there right away don‚Äôt force
Andrew Wiggins is good
"Ever heard of Andrew Wiggins? Oh yeah, it's worth readjusting your value of him 20 games into his career.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andrew-wiggins-lebron-james/"
Andrew Wiggins below Blake griffin is a travesty
now now we all know the goat defender is andrew wiggins
Andrew Wiggins deserves to be in the convo
"&gt; Sometimes he looks like doesn't care    It's growing ever closer to the time when we start saying ""looked"" instead of ""looks.""

Pleasant surprise: Andrew Wiggins   Unpleasant surprise: Draymond Green   Pleasant unsurprise: Steph Curry   Unpleasant unsurprise: Kelly Oubre
"**Most Dominant Player:** Joel Embiid  **Most Impactful Free Agent Signing:** Gordon Hayward  **Most Dangerous Lineup That Doesn‚Äôt Actually Play:** Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nicolas Batum, Serge Ibaka, Marcus Morris Sr.  **All-Around Strangest Development:** Andrew Wiggins becoming mini Mutombo  **Breakout Sidekick:** De‚ÄôAndre Hunter  **Sunniest Bounce Back:** Mike Conley  **Most Concerning Start (That Actually Matters):** Josh Richardson"
andrew wiggins
"I mean, he's no Andrew Wiggins, but he's pretty good."
"Andrew Wiggins, not even joking.  Consider I don‚Äôt watch many games tho"
i remember there was a 'Kawhi vs Wiggins' post YEARS ago probably back in like 2013 and everyone was saying that they would rather have Andrew Wiggins and were confidently saying that he was gonna be better
Iggins Wiggins of Andrew
"its a pretty pathetically bad contract. If you're paying someone 30$ mil a year, they gotta be atleast an all star. Not some fringe starter like andrew shitty wiggins. Great job warriors"
Draymond absolutely makes Curry better.  Elite passer and playmaker + Elite offball mover  Or  Kelly Oubre and Andrew Wiggins  + Elite Oddball mover  To think its a coincidence Curry's resurgence coincided with Draymond coming back is pretty dumb. But that doesn't mean Currt would never be good again if Draymond didnt show up. That's just being overly sensitive to the subject.
Best 2 way player in the league Andrew wiggins much.
"I will say this is the first time I‚Äôve thought of Andrew Wiggins as not a bust for what was expected of him. He looks fantastic this year.  And yea, warriors are gonna be spooky if Klay can just come back at even 80-90% next year. Pray for the KD recovery üôèüèº"
"Here's some more food for thought. Andrew Wiggins, who the Warriors put on the best offensive wing/guard in every game, has been the best player in the league this season at holding his man to below their shooting averages. He also has one of the largest sample sizes of contesting not only regular shots, but also 3s. This stat is from January 11th because I couldn't find his current stats but his defense hasn't slowed:  [https://twitter.com/GSWReddit/status/1348725725075890176?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1348725853140652032%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2\_&amp;ref\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcsports.com%2Fbayarea%2Fwarriors%2Fwarriors-andrew-wiggins-posting-elite-defensive-stats-season](https://twitter.com/GSWReddit/status/1348725725075890176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1348725853140652032%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcsports.com%2Fbayarea%2Fwarriors%2Fwarriors-andrew-wiggins-posting-elite-defensive-stats-season)  Wiggins is also averaging a career high in blocks, and is currently the most prolific shot blocker in the league not assigned with the center position.  He's averaging 18/5/2/1.5/0.5 on 47/40/68 (yikes FT%) with elite defense this season. There's literally nothing more you could ask of the guy. It's other players rn that are throwing away games for them by not finding Curry and Wiggins for more open shots.  I guarantee you though that the Warriors will finish the season better than 2 wins above .500."
"Andrew Wiggins, he's playing like a really good 3 and d wing rn"
Wdym? He has allstar Andrew Wiggins on his team
All star andrew wiggins?
Ever heard of Andrew Wiggins buddy ?
"Nothing super dramatic. The Athletic reported this:  &gt;""Voices that matter in the locker room soured on Russell as a long-term fit rather quickly,"" The Athletic's Anthony Slater wrote. ""He wasn‚Äôt a disruptive personality, just not a beneficial component to a winning defense or a correct fit positionally, considering the two soon-to-return star guards are franchise pillars.""  &gt;""They were so eager to get rid of him that they are embracing a player considered to be on one of the worst contracts in the league,"" Thompson wrote in reference to the contract of Andrew Wiggins. ""Take that as an indictment on Russell, if you want. It doesn‚Äôt seem like he did much to instill confidence. He didn‚Äôt play defense and disappeared when off the ball. He didn‚Äôt instill confidence in the leaders of the franchise that he would figure it out."""
"Wow. This is legitimately one of the spiciest, and worst takes I have ever heard.   You‚Äôre putting Andrew Wiggins on the same level as DLo, Westbrook, and Wall, you absolute homer."
They are not better than Andrew Wiggins by any measure.
"The Raptors. They're pathetic on multiple levels and will be even worse when Kyle Lowry leaves, after which their ""core"" will be led by Pascal ""Andrew Wiggins 2.0"" Siakam. Every game Lowry plays for the Raptors is a waste of his talent, as was most of Kawhi Leonard‚Äôs tenure there. It's actually sickening how inept and incompetent they are year after year. Five more years of shittery and they should honestly be dissolved and a lottery held to determine where their players will play, leaving only a void of patheticity and depression where once an abominable NBA franchise existed."
"It makes no sense how the Warriors have been able to assemble such a craptastic collection of players. When Andrew Wiggins is one of the two players on a team that isn't pissing you off, you know there's something fucked up with the other 13 guys on the team.  Wiseman will of course be fine long term, and is decent enough for a rookie."
"&gt;Bradley Beal, Robin Lopez FOR Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, 1st Round pick  &gt;Beal, Moritz Wagner FOR James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota pick, 1 warriors pick  How the fuck are you equating these two deals, my god"
"I‚Äôm not saying it wasn‚Äôt a success I‚Äôm just saying you shouldn‚Äôt be flexing Andrew Wiggins. I traded my lambo in for a Honda Civic, I‚Äôm not showing it off"
"I remember seeing this exact thread many years ago about Andrew Wiggins. It was an awful decision to have MN not have him focus on getting to the rim, instead they just naturally let him develop into an inefficient midrange jumper with awful efficiency.  Now GSW is doing wonders by breaking those bad habits and having him make smarter decisions both playmaking and scoring.  The last thing NO should do is start instilling a habit of Zion shooting 3's. He's already shown a propensity to being lazy."
Andrew Wiggins. Dude had so much hype and was oozing potential especially as a slasher and he just took a bunch of contested mid-range shots
"&gt; James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota pick, 1 warriors pick  No way Warriors give up Wiggins, Wiseman, and the Minne pick. That would gut their franchise. I like the Bill Simmons idea, which is Wiseman, Oubre for salary matching, Minne pick, Warriors pick. That's 2 bonafide assets + another pick. Maybe the best the Wiz can get."
"The 2 guys I had in mind immediately  stopped playing after 2019, they are 32 and 30 years old respectively and had great talent with some legendary showings. I'm talking about Michael Beasley and Lance Stephenson. Both are still NBA calibre players easily imo in terms of skill but their character is just too tough to deal with along with questionable work ethic. Especially Beasley at times looked like the greatest player in the NBA when he decided to go all out and have a good day at the same time.  Currently in the league I'd say Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins. Andrew Wiggins showed many Superstar-level performances at this point of his career but those games are far inbetween. Lonzo imo shows great athleticism, defense and amazing passing ability as well as general BBIQ. When he goes hard on a drive he's showing glimpses of great finishing qualities and his physique is primed to bully small guard on both ends. His mentality holds him back though. Kind of low-hanging fruit to add to this would be Markelle Fultz lol   Some lower tier ones may be Kristaps and Lauri Makkanen, they look like Dirk on good games but injuries or mental troubles kept them away from having a breakout season into All-Star level (Lauri) or Superstardom (Kristaps). I'll also add Gallinari to the mix as he's an ultra skilled guy but always suffered bad injuries when he finally looked like he figured the NBA out. And a guy that was a Superstar but still never quite reached his peak would be Blake Griffin. Injuries once again held him back from having his best season. If some things went different he'd have a good chance to be a top 10 player, Blake could do it all and had great work ethic."
"Andrew Wiggins. I am a KU fan and I‚Äôve seen these flashes of brilliance going back to his one year with us. He is inconsistent, inefficient and lacks that ‚Äúdog‚Äù mentality. He has solid numbers but I assumed by year 7 that he‚Äôd be a perennial all star"
Kelly Oubre is for us exactly what the Timberwolves' fans have been trying to warn us that Andrew Wiggins would be.
Kelly Oubre is for us exactly what the Timberwolves' fans have been trying to warn us that Andrew Wiggins would be.
Anyone else feel like Andrew Wiggins is the most generic looking dude in the league?
Andrew Wiggins.  Plain and simple
"I am skeptical. He wasn't a good shooter in college and he wasn't a good shooter his rookie year. Look away, but I am getting major Andrew Wiggins vibes from him. He will do just enough to earn a max extension after his rookie contract is up but like Wiggins I am skeptical he will be able to take the next step.   The Knicks are 8-11, they're not awful, so why does RJ Barrett have a 13.2 PER?"
"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.   Mine are -   East:  Jaylen Brown  Brad Beal  Tobias Harris  Domantas Sabonis  Jerami Grant   West:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Chris Paul  Brandon Ingram  Paul George  Andrew Wiggins"
"I'm definitely thinking about how Brad Beal + Steph Curry would be an unstoppable offensive duo but hey if you want to hang your hat on the andrew wiggins' defense is worth passing on brad beal hook, go for it."
Only for Andrew Wiggins to somehow get finals mvp.
Imo Andrew Wiggins and Draymond are better than The following players:  Fat 06 Shaq  Tyson Chandler/ Jason Kidd / Terry  Lowry/Siakam   Curry would be top 5 though.
"It depends on how he plays relative to the rest of his teammate.  If Andrew Wiggins becomes prime KD and Steph has an underwhelming or even average playoff run then it wouldn't rank anywhere in the top 100, for example.  He would have to have by far his best postseason ever by a HUGE margin."
"Reminds me of Wiggins vs Kobe when Andrew scored on him and said, ""I got that from you""üò¢"
"The most consistent scorer in the NBA is...Andrew Wiggins, as we all suspected!"
"&gt;Lol the guy was a shit shooter in college and now he's a dreadful shooter in the NBA. He's not a good passer or playmaker, either. Literally the only thing he's good at is dunking. He'll probably shore up his rim finishing but right now, he's at a horrific 51.6%, which is Fred VanVleet-esque (only VanVleet is 5'11 instead of 6'4).  &gt;The guy is Andrew Wiggins 2.0 but an even worse shooter.   But that doesn't tell me you've watched him either since you are only quoting stats at me.  His finishing at the rim is dreadful atm is because he either does put up a bad shot or he gets hacked and the refs don't call it."

Andrew Wiggins the defensive liability ‚Äî&gt; Andrew Wiggins the swat machine
"I'm just gonna throw this trade idea out there...  Warriors get: Bradley Beal, Thomas Bryant  Wizards get: James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minny's 2021 pick, and some other draft assets"
"Have you read the various articles about the unusual wear and tear prospects have by the time they even reach the NBA due to AAU, specialization etc? Andrew Wiggins was in one of them admitting how much less bouncy he was compared to high school and college. I wonder if the same thing is already applying to Zion, but even moreso due to his size and injuries."
Zion exhibiting Andrew Wiggins work ethic out there
Does Andrew Wiggins still torch OKC every time he plays them?
"Well yeah, obviously I'd overstate that. OP clearly hasn't watched basketball in the past 5 years, or else he'd understand why Cleveland fans don't hate Kevin Love sitting there absorbing 25% of their salary cap to not be his former all-star self. You gotta rub it in a bit for them to truly understand it.      It's different from say a Blake Griffin contract(former star who never brought his teams any glory) or an Andrew Wiggins contract(overpaid role player), he did the work and this is the organization's way of saying thank you for the championship. Tryna make KLove fans feel guilty or some shit."
"Can I just say I like Andrew Wiggins? Not sarcasm, have always rooted for the dude and don‚Äôt agree with all the hate he gets on this sub. That‚Äôs all, thanks for coming to my Ted talk."
"I mean, we have direct evidence of this: Andrew Wiggins."
Lol this comment screams bitterness about the Wiggins trade. It‚Äôs so strange to me that a lot of Twolves fans are determined to tear Andrew down instead of being happy for him that he‚Äôs doing well. And for what it‚Äôs worth I don‚Äôt get the obsession with having to find ‚Äúwinners‚Äù or ‚Äúlosers‚Äù in every transaction personally.
"The protection is stipulated in the trade agreement. It will vary every trade depending on what is decided.  In the case of the Warriors - Timberwolves, Andrew Wiggins, trade if the Minnesota 2021 pick is top 3 and doesn't convey Warriors get Minnesota's 2022 pick unprotected.  In the case of our Warriors - Thunder, Kelly Oubre trade, if the Warriors 2021 pick is top 20 and doesn't convey, the Thunder get two second rounders.  It's all about what was agreed on."
"And Andrew Wiggins has played well for the Warriors, and become a quality defender."
Andrew Wiggins had the same problem in college and i have never once heard anyone blame Bill Self and Kansas' organization for fostering a laziness culture. People just point the finger at our team's culture for any shortcoming since it's an obvious target
Andrew Wiggins.   Dude really lives up to his potential of Maple Jordan vs us every single time.
"lol im sorry andrew wiggins doesn't ""know how the offense runs"" after being there for a year"
"Andrew Wiggins always kills the thunder, the only game I‚Äôve been able to go to he hits a half court game winner. Then drops 30+ every time he plays us"
"Sure, he could be a good role player, but his stats (and like you said contract) are way different than his actual value on a basketball floor.  He suffers from the Zach Lavine or Andrew Wiggins affect where his contract dictates that he should be a first option, but he‚Äôs more of a good third option and his contract gets in the way of fulfilling this."
"I think Andrew Wiggins is a good example of this. I'm not hating on Jimmy, he's one of my favorite non-Warriors, but that type of leadership doesn't work with everyone and it's clear it didn't work with Wiggins. He is doing very well under Steph's type of leadership however."
Andrew Wiggins plays like the number 1 draft pick against the Thunder
"Wiggins was THE example used for advanced stats getting the call right. 2014, 25 games in to his rookie season the advanced stats called him a bust and [538 made this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andrew-wiggins-lebron-james/) which was heavily criticized as everyone said it was too soon to call a 19 yearold a bust.   &amp;#x200B;  and we're not talking about the Timberwolves as a team, we all know they suck. We are talking about Edwards, where stats say he sucks now, and unless he changes will suck later. We can use stats to know that even though Kat is on a bad team he is still a great player."
Shaq ain't some bum youtuber who needs clickbait to pay the rent lol. his motives behind asking him that is probably because he sees Kobe Bryant potential in Donovan Mitchell and is trying to nudge him into having that killer instinct. Donovan Mitchell is probably the closest person in the NBA to having that Kobe mentality. It's not like Shaq is saying this to some bum like Andrew Wiggins who has no chance at ever being great. Everyone knows Mitchell has the potential to be an all-time great.
"Bro this shit is why people don‚Äôt like warriors fans why on earth are you so mad at a joke at Andrew Wiggins expense.  Coming from a wolves fan, the guy is just the worst."

"Lucas of course famously had trouble with cocaine in the 80s. He was on the team with Andrew Wiggins' dad and Lew Lloyd, who got busted with coke and actually got banned from the NBA."
# I LOVE ANDREW WIGGINS
You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about if you‚Äôre calling Jimmy Butler garbo. They made the playoffs and Andrew Wiggins got worse. Just accept that your team is paying a good role player max contract money.
"Andrew ""'Maple' 'Scottie 2 Hotty' scottie"" Wiggins"
"I'm happy for Andrew Wiggins. He has such potential, it's a shame he was stuck on such a dumpster team for so long."
"The same Andrew Wiggins I've watched for years.   I went from being downvoted to being upvoted for being downvoted for the same exact take. Whether it's in 5 months, or whatever, that take will continue to be true, and someday be upvoted again. Wiggins sucks."
It‚Äôs a total blanket statement. I feel like efficiency and other areas of impact should be taken into account when saying that. Like actual empty stats are Andrew Wiggins prior to this season or Caris LeVert
"Don't worry man, they just drafted Anthony Edwards, a man who is slated to become the next *checks notes* Andrew Wiggins."
Iggins Wiggins of Andrew
"&gt; and has a huge narrative that his team is hot trash and he is carrying them  There it is. Andrew Wiggins bust. Kelly Noobre. Draymond ""Triple Single"" Green. /s"
Iggins Wiggins of Two-Way Wiggs of Andrew
[Serious] Is Andrew Wiggins better than Kahwi Leonard?
Not have draymond or Andrew wiggins on there is a shame!
"They told me that the Warriors also got an almost certain lottery pick on top of Andrew ""Maple Jordan"" Wiggins for DeAngelo Russell."
never thought I‚Äôd say this   but Andrew Wiggins could propel this team to be a serious contender if he keeps playing like this AND klay comes back as normal klay
"Andrew ""Don't you dare shoot a 3 in my face coz that's a guaranteed miss"" Wiggins"
How am I supposed to tell my family I‚Äôve fallen in love with Andrew Wiggins?
"Andrew Wiggins has definitely been making a case for DPOY, statistically and well if you watch the games he's been absolutely amazing on defense."
25 players make more money than Andrew Wiggins and I can honestly say I‚Äôd take him over at least 10 of them
"clearly you are, because you replied to someone mentioning brooklyn‚Äôs defense with shifting the entire thing to andrew wiggins and the lakers lmao  you‚Äôre not mad, but your go to response was to try to talk shit.... right.  shouldn‚Äôt you be concerned with Sexton instead of Wiggins? don‚Äôt understand the obsession with him."
I am Proud to be OUT as an Andrew Wiggins fan
"Edwards is Andrew Wiggins 2.0 right now, but he will be good."
Andrew Wiggins
"I'm not shitting on the achievements of Andrew Wiggins and D'Angelo Russell as a human beings, relax. People who @ them on Twitter just to shit on their achievements are losers, but on a board dedicated to NBA discussion then people are going to talk candidly if they think a player has underachieved or been overrated, and I'll comment positively about other players I think deserve it."
"Probably not, Draymond expanded upon the mindset of today's NBA on KD's pod. The hunger to win games comes second to the instagram thots and cars. KD agreed, and mentioned a select few players still want to actually get better every day like Ja Morant, but they are few and far between. Andrew Wiggins is practically living proof for this sentiment."
Andrew Wiggins in shambles
"Seems like an Andrew Wiggins pick all over again. Not saying they are the same player, but that they were both safe picks. You knew they were gonna score 18-20 ppg for a decade. There were no bust or injury concerns."
"For people who says KAT is not being the leader, he‚Äôs still recovering from playing multiple years with Andrew Wiggins"
Yea a carry job of Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green lol. Wth?
Except they really don‚Äôt.. your take is laughably bad. Andrew Wiggins and Draymond green would be the 2nd and third best players on those rockets  Even kelly oubre is average 15 a game albeit on bad efficiency
"What team would be the same after replacing Kevin Durant, Iguodala, and Livingston with Andrew Wiggins, Jordan Poole, and Nico Mannion?  Not to mention Kelly Oubre replacing Klay Thompson"
Theres a website to check if a player has actually been ballin against your squad or if its just all just anecdotal  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/andrew-wiggins-regular-season-gane-stats-vs-thunder-last-three-seasons
"Golden State's salary structure is so bad that the trading Wiseman for a Star talk really doesn't make sense because they would have to move the Andrew Wiggins contract and it would probably cost them an additional asset or two to move it given the salary compared to the play. Just do the mirror test: if you are a Golden State fan, are you really letting go of Steph Curry for James Wiseman and Andrew Wiggins at 60 million over 2 years? Chances are you're not, which means that a hypothetical trade for Karl Anthony towns or kawhi Leonard or Bradley Beal probably ain't happening with the assets the warriors have available.   If the warriors get Thompson back healthy, there's a good chance that they can be a competitive team again and if they can't get him back healthy, there's a good chance that they aren't going to be a competitive team again and that's relatively independent of other factors.  The best case scenario for them is that the Minnesota pick conveys to them and then they get Klay back next year and can make a run with their big three while developing their younger players in meaningful games."
"Draymond green averages 8 assists a game and plays elite defense, andrew wiggins averages 18 PPG and shoots 40% from three and plays elite defense, harden carried the shit out of that team. Stephs team isn‚Äôt good but other players have won games with players just as bad and you need to face that"
"&gt; andrew wiggins, draymond green, kevon looney, kelley oubre, do they  Jesus christ, if you think Oubre or Looney is at all comparable to the talent the Rockets had in 2015 you didn't watch that team. Green is great on defense, but I'm focusing on the offensive talent the Warriors lack. Wiggins is the only player that is comparable to the offensive talent Houston had."
"the fact that you ignored the warriors best players and used the guys at the end of the bench to prove your point kind of shows how dumb it is. andrew wiggins, draymond green, kevon looney, kelley oubre, do they not exist? or are we going to pretend ariza 40 year old jason terry and corey brewer were way better for the sake of making curry look good"
"Legitimate question, how long have you watched the NBA? That Rockets team had 5 players that score more points a night than Ariza, they had Nene and Capela who played better defense than Ariza, and regardless of this, you clearly don't watch the NBA if you think 2017 Ariza's role on the Rockets is equivalent to Andrew Wiggins' role on the Warriors lmfao.   Same goes for you u/LakersBacktoBack"
This Warriors team is abysmal what are you on about lmao. When your third best player is Andrew Wiggins you know you're in trouble (no offence to him he's been improving)
 Andrew Wiggins. It's looking better now but I got mocked really hard when he was in Minnesota.
Look at Iggins Wiggins of Andrew man!
IGGINS OF WIGGINS OF ANDREW
Is Wiggins the best Andrew?
Andrew Wiggins
"&gt; So you wouldn't want Melo bc he might take some of Andrew wiggins' minutes?  No, I wouldn't want Melo because he would either take Klay's minutes (find when he's recovering but what about when he's back 100%?) or be slotted in as a 3 guard when what we need there is exactly what Wiggins does, lockdown D and good/consistent scoring.   &gt; And instead you'd want a guy who wasn't good enough to contribute in any meaningful way?  If you are talking about Wiggins that take is so bad this conversation is over lol. What are you smoking?"
So you wouldn't want Melo bc he might take some of Andrew wiggins' minutes?...seriously? And instead you'd want a guy who wasn't good enough to contribute in any meaningful way? Altho he definitely didn't eat up any of Wiggins minutes so thats a plus
Just give Andrew Wiggins a little time.
"Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins."
"Andrew Wiggins, at least when he was in Minnesota.   So much talent, but he never really showed improvement or growth from his rookie year until recently"
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."
Jabari Parker and Andrew Wiggins were goated in highschool. The second coming of KD and Jordan.
Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker
Andrew Wiggins.
I mean it‚Äôs a lot easier for iggy to come off the bench for a championship team than to be asked to back up Andrew Wiggins on a team struggling to make it
"More like Oubre needs to perform better to guarantee he won't come off the bench.  He is not starting over Klay freakin' Thompson, and even Andrew Wiggins is making a case for the starting 3 going forward."
"Team A would be best. 2 good creators in the backcourt. Lockdown defender on the wing and great rim protection.  How did you come up with these teams? How would they do against   1. Muggsy Bogues, 2-Hal Greer, 3-Andrew Wiggins, 4-Robert Horry, 5-Arvidas Sabonis"
Accepting a bench role on a championship team is different then backing up Andrew Wiggins on a borderline playoff team
I'm going to imagine Andrew Wiggins telling him off
Isaiah Thomas and Andrew wiggins
Andrew fucking Wiggins
He also wouldve shipped Wiseman out before he even played a minute for the Warriors (see: Andrew Wiggins very brief tenure on the Cavs)
"I see spurs fans talk all the time about how their team is a disaster yet they have no all stars and are better than a team with Steph, Draymond, Andrew Wiggins, and Oubre"
Thanks for the Andrew Wiggins career summary.
Opposing teams trying to hire Andrew Wiggins to give a ‚Äúmotivational speech‚Äù to each team about why they shouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated.
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"if you cant move in tight spaces you cant handle the ball in traffic and keep your dribble or playmake in a crowd.  its why some people are slashers and make plays from the post, elbows, wings etc and others are pgs and sgs who can run an offense in every which way from pnr, in a crowd etc.  this isnt arbitrary, its whats required to play the position. guard like movement isnt being fast for your size and taking someone off the dribble, its a short area quickness, body control, and reaction time.  think of the difference between lamelo ball and wiggins. around the same height and frame, but wiggins cant react or move like a guard, so hes a slasher/wing. lamelo can, so hes a playmaking guard.  kd moves like a bigger andrew wiggins w less bounce. he doesnt have the short area reaction time and wiggle guards do. however you frame it, he doesnt move like a guard"
"Those assets were mainly Andrew Wiggins, who they just drafted 1st overall, and their first pick following year.  What would you say is the difference between tanking and just being bad? Staying bad after getting to pick first 3 out of 4 years?  I know Hinkie believed that the best way to become a champion was to amass high picks any way possible to maximise the chance of drafting a superstar."
He got Andrew Wiggins shooting 40% from 3 this season. That alone is an accomplishment itself.
And the GOAT himself Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins worked too hard.
"How is he as bad or close to players like anthony bennett, markell fultz, and andrew wiggins lmao"
Andrew Wiggins lol. I saw a post the other day suggesting he's better than MPJ.
"He is a ""December baby"", for many things that have a cutoff at Dec 31 these people are going to be among the youngest. For some things it is great (NBA Draft) but for other things it is not so great (school).   Giannis is also a December baby, he is just 2 months older than Andrew Wiggins and 3 months older than Jabari Parker, both selected in the 2014 draft. Only 9 months older than Aaron Gordon who was the youngest in 2014."
"Yes. As someone who watched way too many Wolves games, yes RoCo is good but we definitely got more than he was worth in the trade. His defense is definitely great, but a tad overrated. And he played pretty much at his peak in Houston (which was a perfect fit for him), which still wasn't enough to get them past the Lakers buzzsaw. Wiggins was instrumental in our early season success last year. I'd expect us to do better on a night without Cov than a night without Wiggins (which wasn't really the case in 18-19 tbh).   Basically the argument comes down to this for me: would you rather have Robert Covington as the best player on your team, or Andrew Wiggins as your best player? It's pretty obviously Wiggins. Same argument can be applied if you make them the 2nd best player, 3rd best, etc. Yes they have different roles, but Wiggins is the better player and their contracts should really be the only thing that makes it debatable (in which case I'd rather have Cov on his current contract than Wig's)."
Andrew wiggins
I still remember when Andrew Wiggins was at his lowest and there was a thread straight-up asking who was better and sadly most people were saying Cov.
Because his best teammate was Andrew Wiggins. He certainly had the stats.  26.5/11/4.4 on 64% TS and 8 3's a game at 40% clip. if you saw his stats you wouldn't think he was a top 2 center lol?
"It's true but I don't get what people are exactly trying to argue. That Kerr should change the way the team plays, so it would maybe do better when Steph Curry is out?   Yeah it would be nice, but you can say the same about any team. I dunno, is the supposition here that another coach could make a team centered around Wiggins, Oubre and Toscano-Anderson win NBA games? Come on.  This team had four max contracts basically, and at the moment three of these players are out, and the fourth decided to leave so as a lesser evil they chose to s-n-t him for, ultimately, 30 miilion a year for Andrew Wiggins. There's really no wiggling space in this situation. To just hope that their max players, who are good an worth that money, will just be fit, is probably the best they can do.  When they decided to keep all the stars and add Kevin Durant, many people had a first though: ""wow, so this is gonna fuck up their roster possibilities for those years"". Because of that I don't expect that much from Kerr. Yeah the offense is shit... But what can you realistically expect if, without Curry and Dray, anybody they have with any playmaking instinct are guys on minimums and two-way contracts."

"I mean look at the 2016 thunder roster that Westbrook took to the playoffs. The only players that are still in the league are Steven Adams, Jerami Grant, Sabonis, and Oladipo. Grant and Sabonis were both really young and no where near the players they are today, and Oladipo was awful that season.  I'm not saying Draymond, Kent Bazemore, Andrew Wiggins, Oubre, and Wiseman are better (they might be, but I haven't watched any warriors games). But Steph doing worse than what russ already did and gets called GOAT level lmao"
"They‚Äôre one Andrew Wiggins plus 7 picks for Joel Embiid trade away from competing, which is to say it‚Äôs not gonna happen and I think Steph knows that"
"you'd find this to be true at any selection.  DeAndre Ayton was the #1 pick and looks like a role player, Markelle Fultz will be lucky to be a solid role player at this point.  Same for Andrew Wiggins.  Is getting the #1 pick unlucky?"
"They have that many players averaging double digits because none of them could stay on the court lmao what, we had a bunch of different guys give us minutes. The warriors have Andrew Wiggins who is a great defender and averaging 18 PPG on 40% three point shooting. Harden would have loved to have that. Or Draymond who would have been by far our best defender and would have relieved some playmaking off James"
"The top 5 nba draft picks from from 2012-2016 (to weed out players who are still on rookie deals)  * 2012:  AD at 1, Brad Beal at 3, to be fair then Dame at 6. AD and Dame were All Stars quickly, but Beal didn't make an All-Star team until 2018 * 2013: Victor Oladipo made one all star game. A famously pretty bad draft,, though * 2014: Joel Embiid is a slam dunk. Meanwhile people are still waiting to see if Aaron Gordon figures it out, and it's taken Andrew Wiggins 6 years to (maybe) become a good player.  * 2015: KAT, DLo, Zinger all took a while and there are still big questions surrounding all of them.  * 2016: Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all look to be good players but have also all had weird paths to get where they are now.    My point in all of that even top 5 picks are rarely immediately good. It usually takes a couple of seasons to really know what you have, especially when they're entering the league at 18 years old."
They now have andrew wiggins who scores 18 PPG and takes 5 threes a game at a 40% clip and plays great defense. No it is not.
A roster failure not full of g leaguers and Andrew Wiggins as the second best option.
"I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôve just watched Andrew Wiggins play basketball for 6 years. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, I‚Äôve tried to convince myself that Wiggins was going to be good for 6 fucking years"
Andrew Wiggins is the only guy out there tonight who actually knows how to play basketball.
Andrew Wiggins ain't comin back to Canada after this
"I agree with the main points. Who you are, how much you have should not determine right or wrong.    I think there needs to be additional context though. First, disputes between individual players and teams should not always be analyzed in terms of Marxian class relations. I think most of us support players as a CLASS when it comes to negotiating money and free agency and such. But we should be free to criticize individual players or teams without being accused of anything personal or political.    For example, free agency should be supported because players should have more control over their careers. But you can be critical of Durant joining the Warriors for stacking the competition to a historically unprecedented degree. There is no contradiction between the two positions.    Likewise, you should be free to criticize players for underperforming their contracts too. Andrew wiggins got a max deal but very few of us would say he deserved it."
Oh yes let‚Äôs keep wasting year of prime Steph Curry for fucking Andrew Wiggins and uncertainties. If you get PG you‚Äôre competing for a chip with the remaining prime you have left. You do it
"Harden at 7 too, Kobe 13, Kawhi 15, Dame 6, JULIUS RANDLE 7  &amp;#x200B;  Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennet, Jabari Parker  &amp;#x200B;  I think it's hit and miss"
"Glad everyone's enjoying the Andrew Wiggins experience.  This is how he plays.  Shows elite potential for a month, then is ass, rinse repeat on and off for his entire career.  I remember a whole month ago everyone was shitting on this guy when he shot 27 percent from 3 for the entire month."
"Andrew ""availability is the best ability"" Wiggins"
"Andrew ""#1 Pick"" Wiggins"
‚ÄúElite‚Äù defender Andrew Wiggins still had his problems chasing people off ball that he did in Minn
Can we all just be honest? This is clearly Andrew Wiggins team now
Andrew Wiggins is my dad
"24 PPG on 52.9% TS (his numbers since the All-Star break) is not ""pretty good."" It's actually pretty bad when league average efficiency is 57% and he still isn't shooting well from outside.   I'm not comparing them as players since they have pretty different styles, but I swear people were saying the same shit about Andrew Wiggins. He actually wasn't good and it was pretty evident, but he tricked y'all with his 20 PPG on low to mediocre efficiency."
"Wiggins has been on fire since the All Star Break. He had a poor stretch before that which seems like it was due to fatigue, since he started playing much better after the week break.   Andrew Wiggins in the last 9 games:  - 22.7 PPG - 6.1 RPG - 2.1 APG (2.1 turnovers) - 51.1 FG% on 15.7 attempts per game  - 55.1 3P% on 5.4 attempts per game  - 78.6 FT% on 4.7 attempts per game  - 64% TS"
"ESPN be like: Steve Kerr says Andrew Wiggins is ""number one"", is he the face of the Warriors franchise now?"
I'm actually Andrew Wiggins
Front office tried to buy a Rolex after that game but then realized they spent all their money on giving Andrew Wiggins $150 mil because he promised to the owner he would improve
That was until people heard him talk and realized they were making him out to be a dumb black man. He is to some degree of intelligence very smart and it was obvious once you heard him talk. Everyone thought he sounded dumb then you watch the videos and you can tell is comedic intelligence is at a 10 and nots not a case of Andrew Wiggins syndrome where he can never fully hammer the nail when he does something. Two different players with similar skill sets.
Nah son. This sub loves them some Andrew Wiggins.
"What do you think the argument you're making is? That other great players have also been inefficient as rookies?   First, adjust for pace and league average effeciency and Ant looks much worse than all of those others  Second, that doesn't mean that Ant has been good? Other players also shooting poorly in their rookie seasons doesn't make Ant more effective? Andrew Wiggins had a better one than Ant is"
Andrew Wiggins apparently
We have this one guy who is good at shooting his name is Stephen Curry. And then this other super tall guy who just turned 20 and is gonna be a beast in a year or 2. But the real star of the show is we have a guy naked Andrew Wiggins who is basically a better KD who can play defense
"Trading Andrew Wiggins was one of the best moves the Cavs ever made, both short and long term"
"Literally nothing lol.   Kobe isn't even in the top ONE HUNDRED for defensive rating in his career.   He is 240 defensive box plus minus for the 2000s.   His best season as a defender was '99 as the 43rd best defender in the league.  He was a super scorer playing huge minutes, taking tons and tons of possessions off on defense which today we recognize inherently doesn't make them as valuable as defensive specialists.  He never guarded the opponent's best perimeter player for whole games, and basically played a Bird-esque free safety role on defense.   Andrew Wiggins grades as a more consistent and impactful defender than Kobe.   Phil Jackson himself said Kobe coasted on defense and didn't deserve All-Defensive selections.   Do literally one iota of research with analytics, and you find out Kobe wasn't even a consistently GOOD defender, let alone one of the 4 best guards on defense every year and deserving more defensive accolades than legit two way players like KG, Robinson, Ewing. We should just go back, fix these insanely incorrect Kobe gifts, and remove all Kobe's All-D awards. Give them to the Eric Snows of the era"

ESPN: Steve Kerr says Andrew Wiggins was trash prior to the all star break

"I respect Dame for his approach to his career  I also respect others for their approach to their careers, excluding Latrell Spreewell, as i have no issue with a person doing what is in their own best interest personally or from a career standpoint  For every Dame, there is a Lue Wiliams, Lamar Odom, Blake Griffin, Norman Powell, Isaiah Thomas, Andrew Wiggins, D'Angelo Russell, even Andre Drummond was bench to avoid hurting his value, and so on.   Loyalty is great but for most guys it's definitely a one-way street. Once Dame's game slows down the real question will be if he ends up the trading block for his replacement.   If a player wants to put themselves in the best position to achieve a dream they've been chasing since they were kids, I'm all for it."
"Yeah last season he had Andrew Wiggins as his co-star...  I get that you hate him but I really don't get the reason for that lmao, you'd be crying tears of joy if he decided he wanted to go to the Pistons..."
"&gt;Like I said literally the only thing Towns is better at on offense than Towns is shooting more 3s. Jokic is scoring 27 PPG on 65 TS%. Last season Towns scored 26.5 PPG on 64 TS%. He averaged the same amount of turnovers and almost half the assists of Jokic. You're ridiculous if you think shooting more 4 more 3s and scoring at overall slightly worse efficiency means that Towns is a better offensive player than Jokic.   You obviously don't watch KAT then if you don't think his impact on the perimeter doesn't have an effect to the game. Also he averaged those stats with Andrew Wiggins as his best teammate btw.  Jokic is having a real tough time carrying MPJ,Murray and Will Barton this season :("
I mean it‚Äôs not the craziest take. We‚Äôve seen high school players all the way since Andrew Wiggins who have let us down. Can‚Äôt even begin to name all the players.
Andrew Wiggins is fucking nice.
"Another issue with the max salary is that it‚Äôs the automatic starting point for negotiations for lots of players who aren‚Äôt worth it. You can say of course your team shouldn‚Äôt offer the max to a player like Andrew Wiggins but then if he hits free agency it only takes one team to offer him a max and he‚Äôs gone, and will feel disrespected by your team."
"Ok so not at borderline historic efficiency? Dudes efg% is prime steph level right now, so the amount of space between that and *Andrew freaking Wiggins* is more than enough cushion lol"
"Minnesota Timberwolves at Sacramento Kings December 26, 2019  Final Score: MIN 105 SAC 104 after 2OT  Some of the worst shooting performances I have ever seen. All of these players had more shot attempts than points.  Andrew Wiggins: 4/19 (2/9 from 3)  Jeff Teague: 5/17 (1/6 from 3)  Harrison Barnes 2/12 (2/4 from 3)  Buddy Hield 6/20 (3/11 from 3)  Bogdan Bogdanovic 8/28 (3/16 from 3)"
"I don't think that's the public perception of young players. We're mostly just excited to see them play the first few years and watch them develop skills to see if they measure up to the expectations.   Think about what happened with players like markelle fultz and Andrew wiggins. They came in with high expectations and for all manner of reasons they just never really lived up to the hype. With the exception of some disappointed hometown fans, people weren't really trashing those dudes for being underwhelming. Most people just accepted that they weren't what we thought.   To the original point though... Wiseman is in a unique situation since he plays for a team with a roster that when healthy is a serious contender. Nobody is expecting him to go out there and be shaq. Most Warriors fans are just stoked to have snatched him up and have something entertaining to watch before the real squad gets healthy again."

"What Randle and Zach are doing now they did during their rookie/sophmore years. The difference is 1) both are in the East and 2) they are playing with more talent and 3) they have become more proficient at what they already did well. Sure that‚Äôs ‚Äòdevelopment,‚Äô but we could see what type of players they could become early in their careers AND they had enough statistical markers to make that promising. Both those players have been at a all star/sub all star level plenty of times in their career, this season they have been able to sustain that level of play (for example, I think the last year Randle was on the Lakers he was playing at a sub all star level for the first month of the season and blue balled fans for the rest of the year when he didn‚Äôt sustain it).   It literally took until Andrew Wiggins was traded before twolves fans stopped talking about his potential to ‚Äòput it all together,‚Äô when he had five years worth of data and hundreds of games to show that he was an inefficient scorer who has inconsistent effort on defense.   Fans never think their guy is a sinking ship because fans are always tantalized by the potential of what a player can be and completely ignore or brush over what a player currently is when there is ample evidence to show that hopes shouldn‚Äôt be that high.   That is not to say that Wiseman and Ant can‚Äôt grow to be awesome players and I think both have shown flashes of the players they can be. That being said, their potential does not outweigh what Lamelo is showing us right now. Like kings fans who tried to defend the Bagley pick were rightly ridiculed for talking about the potential of a player who showed he could be an offensive superstar over a player who was actually being an offensive superstar. Of course Lamelo did not have the same pedigree coming into the draft as Luka did, but teams and this sub completely focused on the wrong things with him and undervalued the amazing things he could do. Draft experts told us for months about the type of player Lamelo could be and that the negatives in his game were overblown and could be corrected by proper coaching.   That is markedly different from a player like Giannis who literally had to go thru a complete body transformation and maximize all his talents to become an MVP. And also, Giannis showed enough his rookie year that we could see if he kept on the same development track he would be a star."
"Jesus.   Minnesota just keeps getting fucked by Golden State.   Tim Hardaway, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, the failed Klay trade, Andrew Wiggins, and now a first rounder in either 2021 or 2022.   I honestly feel really bad for the Wolves. Fuck you, Glen Taylor."
But MFs still gonna tell me GTj is better than Andrew Wiggins
Shaq Andrew Wiggins too maybe
"Well they're 18-15 now.   The Warriors are a team and Draymond is trash this season and Klay's career is probably.. let's just say not the same.   I know Andrew Wiggins is Canadian jesus but ya know maybe, maybe hes just sort of above average okayish jesus?  Also maybe Bill Simmons is dumb af?"

Jokic and Horford are both 10 for 18, AD is 12 for 26, and Reggie Jackson is a scorching 2 for 28."
"That's a weird position to take on the Warriors. Oubre and Wiggins weren't even on the ESPN top 100. Not that that is the gospel bur it does provide some context. Wiseman is a rookie still with much to learn. That's why he got benched recently. Not to mention he just missed a whole month.  Their bench is literally made up of mostly g league players.   And don't even get me started on the salary cap point. Klay Thompson is out. And Andrew wiggins is universally recognized as the worst contract in the league.    I'll say it this way. If Steph wins more with his Roster than Lebron does with his while AD out, that will tell you all you need to know."
"With the 1st Overall Pick of the 2021 Draft, The Minnesota Timberwolves select...  Andrew Wiggins?"
"And what‚Äôs even more hilarious is that the t wolves traded Andrew Wiggins and their 2021 First Round Pick for D‚ÄôAngelo Russell.  So not only is Wiggins having his best statistical season so far, The Warriors also get The T-Wolves upcoming pick to go along with Wiseman! (Top 3 protected).  At the time, many people including Windhorst thought The T Wolves won that trade.  But now looking back at it, it‚Äôs so laughable.   Such a shitty franchise and I feel bad for the wolves fans.  My warriors were terrible too before that first championship and even before We Believe so I know what incompetence feels like."
"Without Anthony Davis, is LeBron James just an Akron Andrew Wiggins?"
"Bradley Beal was inefficient in college, as was Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, and Zach Lavine. I‚Äôm obviously not saying he‚Äôs going to be close to those guys, but he‚Äôs going to be more efficient then he is now. How efficient, I don‚Äôt know and neither do you. It‚Äôs incredibly ignorant to say Ant is the next Andrew Wiggins this early into his career. Just let him atleast finish the season before saying he‚Äôs a bust"
"Inefficient is a major issue. He wasn't efficient in college either. Who is to say that's going to change? His main skill is supposed to be scoring - what good is a scorer that can't score efficiently? Hint: not good.  And not passing is also a major issue. Passing is the most underrated skill in the nba.   They drafted Andrew Wiggins 2.0   Lamelo at least came in with 2 elite nba skills - passing and ball handling. And those are 2/3 of the most important things for a guard to do, the other being shooting.   There's nothing that edwards is elite at besides being athletic, and athletes are a dime a dozen"
Just a funnier andrew wiggins
Andrew Wiggins
"Has not worked out for 76ers yet. NBA is so talent driven. A few of the right guys can make it happen, unlike football or baseball. On a team of 48 players, don‚Äôt think so. On a team of 15, it could work but those teams at the bottom are not likely to develop the player right.  For every magic Johnson, shaq, lebron... there is a Markell‚Äôs fultz, Andrew Wiggins, or kwame brown. (All first overall picks)."
"Yeah you were done before you even got started; you got nothing. Its still the same job for the same organization implementing the same vision for the same POBO around the same franchise cornerstone. Sure, Andrew Wiggins isn't here anymore, but its the same job in virtually every regard that matters."
Feels good to have Looney back. His +/- goes to show how useful he is even though he made 1 basket. Wiseman needs some more reps to get back in a groove.  Steph is unbelievable this year. As great as he is playing and as much credit as he is getting I still think he‚Äôs underrated. If the bench can be more consistent I think they are a lock playoff team with potential first round upset if they finish 7 or 6 seed. Shout out Andrew Wiggins who has played so well this year. Yes he‚Äôs overpaid but he has really impressed me this year. Would love to see him make an all defensive team.
"Book‚Äôs still great though! I think the difference is that Lavine‚Äôs always been an underdog, Devin hasn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs been a media favorite since his second season. Yet he &amp; Booker have been in a similar range stats-wise the past few years, Lavine‚Äôs been on a much more dysfunctional, injurie-plagued squad.  They‚Äôre both incredible scorers, but this season, Lavine‚Äôs game is a bigger leap away from peers around his age like Booker, D-Lo, and Andrew Wiggins."
Andrew Wiggins
"You mean the season he had 59 game of jimmy butler or the one where he had 10?  Yeah the 2018-19 season he had a cool 48 games with roco that was fun. Jared bayless started a few games for us back then because Rose and tyus was hurt. Keita bates diop and Cam Reynalds also played a shit ton of rotational minutes for us. All this time Andrew Wiggins was his co star, the warriors are 16-15 with Wiggins as curry‚Äôs co star and way better roster talent than what ever Kat has had"
He look like Andrew Wiggins
But with all those new additions to the team they can't heavily feature legendary big men St Andrew Nicholson or Khem Kong. Wiggins would finally get to play with LeBron though. Lol.
"Dang, you're right:  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28647843/warriors-trade-dangelo-russell-wolves-andrew-wiggins  A fact-checker at ESPN's about to lose their job."
Thanks for linking to Doogie‚Äôs reporting. It shows that Thibs may have considered moving Wiggins in the Butler trade. I am aware that Taylor signs all the checks so you don‚Äôt need to condescend to me. I have never seen any reporting that shows Thibs was against signing Wiggins to the Max contract. The espn article you sent only mentions Thibs once saying he‚Äôs expecting a lot of improvement for Andrew.
"https://mobile.twitter.com/SKORNorth/status/971893696856842240  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20277493/minnesota-timberwolves-owner-glen-taylor-wants-meeting-andrew-wiggins-gets-max-deal  It turns out the owner is the GM's boss, and you can't just blindly blame the GM for every decision a team makes."
"Ah yes the annual Andrew ""I hate OKC"" Wiggins dad-dicking of the Thunder"
Running back some tape on my favorite college player ever after he just dropped 50 on my Bulls. Forever grateful to Andrew Wiggins for tricking me into watching regular season college hoops.   The pass at 1:05 cracked me up because Zach Lowe and the RTRS guys were just talking about how that's essentially the only thing he can't do. There he is doing it in his 4th year of organized basketball.
"At that point Andrew Wiggins arm is still locked up with Gordon, don't know how you could concretely say Gordon has enough possession after a jump ball to call timeout..."
"well they dont call him andrew ""makes it look so easy"" wiggins for no reason"
"Lebron's return bailed him out of  what was a terrible re-build with the Cavs featuring Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters and a future Andrew Wiggins."
"It's not like Lonzo was out there thinking ""I take a small number of free throws so shooting 47% of them isn't that detrimental""  It's much more likely that he was like ""I am the most hyped prospect since Andrew Wiggins and every single time I miss a free throw a million people see it, they make fun of my form but it's all I know, and I check twitter when I'm on the bench and it's devastating  Let's not forget Lonzo's second game in the NBA he was super aggressive driving to the rim"
I always remember this matchup as the games where Andrew Wiggins goes off for like 37 when he plays the Canadian team
And the sixers would have Andrew Wiggins.  As a sixers fan i do not approve of putting this thought in my head.
"All of a sudden Mr. Triple Single and Andrew ‚ÄúWorst Contract in the League‚Äù Wiggins are jus too much help lmao. People stay moving the goalpost, acting like they didn‚Äôt have the Warriors missing the playoffs."
Alternate universe where Lebron is Andrew Wiggins
Yes him and Andrew 'maple jordan' Wiggins
Yeah and Andrew Wiggins is better than Steph Curry
Andrew wiggins is better than MJ and LeBron combined when he plays us
Going for the deepest team cuz I‚Äôm building the team on 2k with no injuries and gonna see how it goes!  Starters: PG: John Wall ($15) SG: Klay Thompson ($16) SF: Demar Derozan ($13) PF: Christian Wood ($13) C: Nikola Vucevic ($17  Bench: PG: Terry Rozier ($6) SG: Collin Sexton ($14) SF: Andrew Wiggins ($9) PF: Julius Randle ($6) C: Clint Capela ($9)  Roster Fillers: Kevin Knox: ($1) Isaiah Thomas: ($1)
* PG: John Stockton * SG: Klay Thompson (could be MJ but he's GOAT already) * SF: Andrew Wiggins * PF: Dirk Nowitzki * C: Hakeem Olajuwon
lmfao to anyone who thinks Anthony Edwards is anything like Andrew Wiggins. Completely different attitude and mindset and Ant has shown to be a much better finisher and passer. Please watch some games and press conferences before making rash comparisons.
When your second best shooter is Andrew Wiggins or a rookie centre your gravity doesn't matter. Last season the warriors were the second worst three point shooting team.
"Andrew Wiggins is one of the least efficient volume scorers in the history of this entire fucking sport by every measurable statistic, what is actually wrong with you?"
"I just mentioned Terry Rozier and Andrew Wiggins, are you blind?"
"I believe if Andrew Wiggins, Tyler Herro, OG Anunoby, Terry Rozier were given the same situation that Grant has been given in Detroit, they would do similar. Those 4 are not even sniffing all-nba talent. Jerami Grant is not that fucking efficient lmao he shoots 44% from the field and 39% from 3. It‚Äôs ok."

"Andrew Wiggins is looking like the answer honestly, man has been balling offensively and defensively"
Andrew Wiggins üìàüìàüìàüìà  Turns out Minnesota may have just not been a good situation for him. Totally think he can be the 2nd best player on a playoff team.
Andrew Wiggins - check  Another high Timberwolves draft pick - check being sPoOkY - check
"Somehow Andrew ""2-way"" Wiggins ends with a game-high **+25** ?"
"I love Eric Paschal  I love Kent Bazemore  I love Andrew Wiggins  I love Kelly Oubre Jr.  I love Juan Toscano-Anderson  I love Steph Curry  I love that all these guys feel like they've got extra pride wearing these uniforms and playing for this team. On a night that Steph was shooting horribly the rest of the team came together and made plays, made big shots, came up with huge rebounds and came back in a big way. These guys are just getting better and everyone's really coming together as a unit and I'm excited for everything to come."
ANDREW WIGGINS IS MY FAVORITE BASKETBALL PLAYER OF ALL TIME
IGGINS WIGGINS OF ANDREW!!!
IGGINS WIGGINS OF ANDREW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!1!1!!1!!1!!!
andrew fucking wiggins.
Andrew ‚ÄúLockdown defender‚Äù Wiggins
Since being inserted into starting line up Edwards Hs been as good or better then Andrew Wiggins was in Twolves uni
"Everyone saying ""Bates and Holmgren have crazy potential, obviously them"" -- remember when Andrew Wiggins was the second coming? When Jahlil Okafor was the next MVP Center? Highly touted prospects with insane ""potential"" bust all the time. You take Mitchell and Robinson any day of the week."
He's been playing hurt but shooting less efficiently than Andrew Wiggins is :(
Team success matters and the 2021 Warriors' second best scorer is Andrew Wiggins. This season's supporting cast is just not good enough to string together long winning streaks.
"I think I kinda took in either two different ways, both of which are not just talking about people on reddit or Twitter.   The first is talking in the media. The blame for failures usually falls on the players rather than the organizations, not always but usually. The Mark Cuban/Skip debate about Lebron in Miami is a good example of this. People talk about how Lebron didn‚Äôt give enough effort, or another player choked on the big stage. They don‚Äôt talk talk about if the coach didn‚Äôt put the player in the right place to succeed, or if the opposing defense ran the right schemes to lock them up. Some people are better at this than others, but for many of the biggest names in the media the blame usually falls on the players.   The second is talking about player development. If a player is failing to develop like expected, the blame is usually on him. Especially if a player is a high draft pick, and then people are very quick to call them a bust. And sometimes they are a bust, but there are plenty of cases where getting in a different situation, where they are utilized differently or developed differently and they succeed. Look at Andrew Wiggins. The narrative over the past few years around him has been that he‚Äôs a bust and it‚Äôs his fault he hasn‚Äôt done anything. Now look at him in a new environment with a different coach and he‚Äôs doing so much better."
"Romeo is a much more natural playmaker and is a better off ball defender than Brown while only sacrificing a bit in athleticism. If you improve Romeos shooting to an elite level (a big and likely unrealistic ask) and he fills out his frame allowing him to progress into being a great on ball defender (to go along with him already being a better hustle/off ball defender) and all of his other skills develop well then absolutely he can have a higher ceiling than JB.  You gotta understand that ceiling is different than expected outcome. Andrew Wiggins has/had a higher ceiling than Klay Thompson, doesn‚Äôt mean that Wiggins was ever gonna be the better player. He just could‚Äôve been if everything broke right."
Andrew Wiggins averages 17/4 and he‚Äôs seen as a an improvement
"The same way Andrew Wiggins treats the Thunder, at least back when he was on the Wolves"
"&gt;Hey man, if you want to look at Curry‚Äôs high volume scoring on super high efficiency and pretend like Kelly Oubre and andrew wiggins are the actual reason that the warriors are in contention for a playoff run, then be my guest.   Bro, you can't make an argument in good faith to save your life. No one's saying Oubre is the reason the Warriors are (barely) in the playoff picture. I was just correcting your flat out lie that this is the same team as last year + Curry.  &gt;And calling people curry stans for just appreciating good basketball is a bit asinine. You can appreciate Harden‚Äôs greatness without immediately having to attack his contemporaries - Steph, Giannis, Lebron, or any other players Harden is frequently compared to being fantastic, ‚Äúfloor raising‚Äù players doesn‚Äôt mean that Harden is not right up there with them. I‚Äôm not really sure why players can‚Äôt just get respect on threads like this one without commenters needing to rile themselves up over other players also being good.  Proving why Harden is better than Curry at something doesn't mean I hate Curry. I'm glad Curry is healthy and pray he'll continue to be healthy for years to come because the league is better with superstars around like Steph Curry. But why do people get so defensive, particularly about Curry, as if any objective arguments against him are blind hate?  The only reason I commented in the first place is because there's been a slew of Stephew takes in the past few weeks shitting on all other greats by saying Steph is better than them because of his recent good play, like Harden and even Tim Duncan (for some reason) and then have the gall to claim Steph is somehow 'hated by the media'. Even if you're a Curry stan, or a Bron stan or whoever, the facts matter."

The latest voting tally and Wood's injury are leaving the door open for Andrew Wiggins.  Rest of the league: (shocked Pikachu face)
My man Andrew Wiggins is going to make it.
"What would the All Empty Calorie Team be?  Clearly:  C - Drummond  PG - Westbrook  For the rest, how about:     SF - Andrew Wiggins  PF - John Collins  SG - Zach Lavine"
You do better with better players around you; see Andrew Wiggins this season
Andrew Wiggins or at least this year‚Äôs version of him
Andrew Wiggins
"have you seen his shot selection?   Yes, he's making 3's at a very nice rate, but his overall shot selection is indeed like Minnesota version Andrew Wiggins, I have been saying it all season"
"Andrew Wiggins.   Need 10 points? I‚Äôll get you 17.  Need 25? I SAID, I‚Äôll get you 17."
Andrew Wiggins. Consistent 18 ppg on good efficiency and good defense since the season begins. He would actually be the perfect third option if Klay is healthy
Yup and Canada‚Äôs best prospects are Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennet. Go figure
I love Jamal Murray but Andrew Wiggins has been just as good as him this year. There‚Äôs a reason GSW and Denver have almost identical records.
"Not sure if this is supposed to be an insult, but there are worse things to be than Andrew Wiggins!"
he‚Äôs just Andrew Wiggins with tats
Kinda like how Andrew Wiggins is just Corey Brewer with a high school mixtape
he‚Äô got zach lavine and andrew wiggins mix. Also Kuminga gotta be the #2 prospect in this draft
Needs more Andrew ‚ÄúMaple Jordan‚Äù Wiggins
Huh? You‚Äôre drafting your no.2 luck with Andrew Wiggins in mind?  Lamelo is better than wiseman. And center has no value compared to other positions. It would be very easy for lamelo to play with the warriors big 3
the opposite of andrew Wiggins
"You say this like he caused a giant rift in the team, he literally gifted us 2 rings and let us get Andrew wiggins and a pick instead of leaving straight up and you're gonna be salty about it? Cus he didn't play the kind of basketball you like? Come on bruh"
"Yeah, even Andrew ""2 way wiggs"" Wiggins who is having a resurgence season have way better case than KD."
"By far the Wiggins contract, It's not even close. A lot of people here like to Monday morning quarter back after Jimmy left saying they shouldn't have made the trade cause Lavine was obviously good and there was no way they were going to do anything in the playoffs.   They were 1 game out of the 3 seed even though Jimmy missed a quarter of the season. They were a really good team with Butler on it. Lavine was coming off an ACL tear there was no guarantee that he was going to be any good. He is only now 3 years later making any impact toward winning. The Wiggins contract was the main reason that Butler wanted to leave. He didn't like that Andrew ""try every 8th game"" Wiggins was making more money than him."
"If he carries this shit team to a ring he gets top 10, Andrew Wiggins winning a ring lmao  It's not happening though"
"Jazz, because I don‚Äôt trust Andrew Wiggins to be a competent robin to Curry in the post season."
ANDREW WIGGINS
"Andrew Wiggins, Kelly, Draymond, Klay, Steph? What are you crying about? You have way more help than other stars like Dame and Luka."
iggins wiggins of andrew
"Andrew Wiggins doesn't have the makings of a varsity athlete.  Now, we know why."
"&gt;ver draymonds leadership style is has resonated with Andrew while KG and jbutt‚Äôs did not. Or the trade was maybe a wake up call for Wiggins and he was more receptive to leadership.  Draymond just covers everyone's ass like a mfer. That's not leadership, that's pure ability and talent with insane BBIQ and feel for the game."
There's a reason KG is one of greatest players in NBA history and Andrew Wiggins is a straight up scrub.
" In the locker room there used to be a couch and TV next to the kitchen, so we walk in and KG‚Äôs there. It looks like he‚Äôs been there. He‚Äôs watching the movie ‚ÄúShrek 2.‚Äù It‚Äôs the final scene where Shrek is fighting for his life. He sees me and Andrew (Wiggins) and he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòCome here, come here.‚Äô So we walk over there. He‚Äôs real into the movie. ‚ÄúYou see this shit right here, this is what this shit‚Äôs about. You die for what you believe in. You die for your boys. This is that mentality we need to have going into the game. It‚Äôs about war. It‚Äôs about going down with your boys. I love this shit. This shit gives me goosebumps.‚Äù I look, and he actually has goosebumps. I‚Äôm a big KG guy and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm with you man. This is how we gotta play.‚Äù He‚Äôs like ‚Äúright, Zach. You feel me Wiggs?‚Äù Andrew Wiggins says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know even know what ‚ÄòShrek 2‚Äô is, I‚Äôve never heard of this movie.‚Äù The look on his face was like perplexed. Not anger, but just like get out of my face. So he just looks at us and says, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall go get ready for the game, man.‚Äù"
This is why Zach Lavine is better than Andrew Wiggins offensively
I guess whatever draymonds leadership style is has resonated with Andrew while KG and jbutt‚Äôs did not. Or the trade was maybe a wake up call for Wiggins and he was more receptive to leadership.
"Maybe Dray is just better at knowing his audience.  &gt;In the GS locker room there used to be a bed made of living swans that get replaced every day and a 80"" Ultra Wide Ultra Curved Ultra 3D next to the kitchen, so we walk in and Dray‚Äôs there. It looks like he‚Äôs been there. He‚Äôs watching the movie ‚ÄúMounties.‚Äù It‚Äôs the final scene where Alan Thicke is fighting off 500 zombie grizzly bears to protect his maple farm. He sees me and Andrew (Wiggins) and he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòCome here, come here.‚Äô   &gt;   &gt;So we walk over there. He‚Äôs real into the movie. ‚ÄúYou see this shit right here, this is what this shit‚Äôs about. You die for what you believe in. You die for your maple syrup. This is that mentality we need to have going into the game. It‚Äôs about war. It‚Äôs about going down with your boys. I love this shit. This shit gives me goosebumps eh.‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;I look, and he actually has goosebumps eh. I‚Äôm a big Dray guy and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm with you man. This is how we gotta play.‚Äù He‚Äôs like ‚Äúright, KOubre. You feel me Wiggs?‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;Andrew Wiggins says ‚ÄúHECK YEAH! MAPLE SYRUP! I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABUT!!!‚Äù The look on his face was like enraged. Not anger, but just like he is going to tear the face off of every zombie grizzly bear he comes across. So he just looks at us and says, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall go get ready to kill every single one of those Memphis mother oofers, man, eh.‚Äù"
"&gt; I look, and he actually has goosebumps. I‚Äôm a big KG guy and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm with you man. This is how we gotta play.‚Äù He‚Äôs like ‚Äúright, Zach.

As a dire hard wolves fan. This explains a lot about Andrew Wiggins and even more Zach Lavine..... i miss Zach :(
"&gt;Andrew Wiggins says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know even know what ‚ÄòGladiator‚Äô is, I‚Äôve never heard of this movie.‚Äù  Ban this man. For life."
I'm sure Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix have no idea who Andrew Wiggins is either
Andrew Wiggins guys there's still time...

"Couldn't open YouTube without those damn ""Andrew Wiggins GOES OFF"" videos assaulting your homepage back in the day LMAO  \#BallIsLife"
"I didn't get to see the Warriors play but they sounded like great games. I can't wait to see how they do in the play-ins, hopefully Andrew Wiggins gives us another show"
This is just not true.   [Some metrics show it was the worst of his career](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-most-improved-defenders-andrew-wiggins-miles-bridges-georges-niang-pj-dozier/)
"Here's my list:  * DeMar DeRozan - It feels like he has fallen off a crater since being traded away from Toronto. I think he's obviously good, but if he's your best player or two your team doesn't go anywhere. I predict he'll have a sneaky great back-end of his career if he takes a steep pay-cut (maybe can take up the Rudy Gay role in some outside contender back East?)  * Andrew Wiggins - I thought Wiggins sucked in Minnesota and was a volume scorer. Now it looks like his efficiency numbers have gone up with the Warriors. What's there plan with him? Do Warriors fans like him? How does his role change with Klay back?  * Collin Sexton - He's a guard I loved out of college at Alabama but I don't know what to make of his scoring numbers on Cleveland, and I can't imagine the ""I'm the #1 on this team"" mentality can be good for a young player given some of the stories Russillo has told about his shoot-first game.   Any team fans that can provide insight would be much obliged"

"Canada could have a good ass team.   Jamal Murray / RJ Barrett / Andrew Wiggins / Dwight Powell / Chris Boucher with Shai, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Trey Lyles, Khem Birch is a hella respectable team."
Stop trying to make Andrew Wiggins a bust.
"And this Andrew is a Wiggins, so it's not like it's perfect."
"Stop trying to make Andrew Wiggins happen. He was a first-round draft pick, and a bust. He's a professional athlete, he should have numbers like this more regularly. He's shooting efficiency, was probably just the luck of the draw of the night. Three assists, and one steel isn't anything spectacular. And only seven boards? Pitiful. It's mostly pitiful because people think this is good."
"Yeah, like Andrew Wiggins clearly has improved but the answer to ""How did Andrew Wiggins score 38 on one of the best teams in the league?"" is that ""[Steph Curry had between 2-4 defenders on him at all times""](https://twitter.com/damanr/status/1392485906913763330?s=19)"
With Andrew Wiggins as his best teammate and one season with butler? U blaming him for the dysfunction of the franchise?

‚Äúi guess i gotta do everything myself‚Äù -Andrew ‚ÄúThe Warriors Only Superstar‚Äù Wiggins
It's saying the warriors would be .581 with Andrew Wiggins as stephs second best offensive player.  That's a huge statement and a huge blow to people who said curry can only do well with 4 other all stars on his team.
&gt; warriors fans are acting like he‚Äôs suddenly untouchable and super valuable.  #Because to us he is.  There is no way for the Warriors to get a better player than Andrew Wiggins.
"He lived up to it today.  And that's enough, because the Warriors have Steph Curry and are going to get Klay Thompson back, and if Andrew Wiggins is a rock-solid defender who makes a decent contribution on O... except when the team really needs him and then he *steps the fuck up* like this?  He's worth it.  Not that he wouldn't be anyway, because *the Warriors are capped anyway* and Wiggins is a perfect fit. There is no way the Warriors could replace him with a better player, there just isn't."
"&gt; That contract will always take away from what he produces on the court.  No it won't, but if you think that maybe you shouldn't have given it to him.  At this point: why do you care about Joe Lacob's money? Because literally the only people affected by Andrew Wiggins's pay rate are Andrew Wiggins and Warriors ownership. The Warriors are capped out with or without him."
I‚Äôll will gladly pay you $100 if Andrew Wiggins ever makes an All Star team.
"Ok then why don‚Äôt you revisit this in a year. I mean it has been a full season and it‚Äôs been his best season to date given his defensive [improvement.](https://sports.yahoo.com/andrew-wiggins-five-most-improved-205457546.html). Dlo may fit you better but I doubt it. And giving up a lottery pick, you were wrong to give Wiggins that bag and wrong to give away a pick to move him for a similar situation in a player not worth the max."
The Warriors have no desire to trade Andrew Wiggins. You must be careful son or you may find yourself stranded on... Wiggins Island.
"I choose my favorite teams after seeing 1 player who becomes my favorite player, and determines my favorite team, well in like 2013 I think, I was like 9 years old and was watching NCAA bball for the first time I can remember, it was then that I chose Kansas as my favorite college team bc of Andrew Wiggins, I have always hoped he would succeed and now it is finally happening, and it brings me joy"
"Blake is a hall of fame player. He is a 6x All Star and 5x  All NBA. Andrew Wiggins hasn‚Äôt made a single one of those. It is a terrible comparison, mate."
Hi new fan here! I heard Andrew Wiggins was the #1 pick! How did he end up on the Warriors?!?!
Listen here u little shit. Nobody shuts down Andrew Wiggins
That is a terrible argument. Hakeem is a hall of fame player. Blake Griffin is likely a hall of fame player. Andrew Wiggins is not. That is a very bad comparison to make.
"Again - you‚Äôre not addressing the main point. Andrew Wiggins is a high end role player being paid like an all star. He is a good player, but warriors fans are acting like he‚Äôs suddenly untouchable and super valuable."
You‚Äôre not addressing the point. Andrew Wiggins is a high end role player. He has not lived up to the contract. That was the original question. Let‚Äôs not get carried away here.
"Stephen ""Can't Carry"" Curry is playing with:   * Draymond ""Unscorer"" Green * Andrew ""No Heart"" Wiggins * Kent ""Foul Trouble Vet-Min"" Bazemore * Kevon ""Oldest 25-Year-Old Ever"" Looney * a bunch of G-Leaguers  Even without two all-stars, the Jazz still have better depth than the Warriors, yet the Warriors won anyway."
I love this team dearly. But this is a team that you can game plan for very easily. The second best offensive player on the team is either Andrew Wiggins or Jordan Poole.
# ANDREW. MOTHERFUCKING. WIGGINS!!
Andrew Wiggins
"Andrew Wiggins has been so good for us this year. Totally worth his contract, kept us alive in the first half when nothing was falling.   We really came out as well as I could have hoped for with Wiggins, great defender this year too with Klay out.  Plus his mid range - he's a livingston type paint player replacement. Looking forward to the full squad next season.  Great game the clutch minutes were super entertaining, back to back wins! Having fans always makes the games better!"
Andrew Wiggins slander shall never be tolerated in general
"Every once in a great while, Andrew Wiggins has a game where he looks like he was the number one pick seven years ago"
IGGINS WIGGINS OF ANDREW SAID FUCK STEPHEN A SMITH
ANDREW WIGGINS IS OFFICIALLY THE GOAT
Still waiting for that inevitable Andrew Wiggins regression...
I love Andrew Wiggins now
Andrew Wiggins that is all
Michael ‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins‚Äù Jordan
ANDREW CHARLES WIGGINS
I will not tolerate Andrew Wiggins slander tonight
Andrew Wiggins assblasting Suns lol That's my man
Andrew Wiggins MVP
god disguised as Andrew Wiggins

At least Andrew Wiggins knows what a chair looks like.
I'm canadian and bought into the andrew wiggins hype üò¨
"Kobe was not an All NBA defender at all, and his selections to any of the defensive teams are the worst awards handed out during the pre-analytics era.  Kobe's BEST defensive season was in 99 when rated as the 43rd best defender in the league.   Andrew Wiggins actually rates as a more consistent, impactful defender than Kobe.  Dirk Nowitzki and Larry Bird have more defensive win shares than Kobe.   Kobe logged huge minutes and totally loafed on defense for the first 35 minutes of the game. He didn't guard the best perimeter players for the majority of the game. He lazily gambled in passing lanes to pad his steal stats. He saved all of his effort for offense.  Kobe would ""lockdown"" a perimeter player for the final few minutes of a game, tugging at his shorts, clapping, scowling, and putting on a big show... These performances became myth making, and perpetuated the now provably false belief that Kobe was some kind of lockdown defender all game long along with meaningful steal totals.  Kobe was the greatest actor in NBA history. He acted his way into those selections. ""Look at Kobe Bryant's INTENSITY, his WILL to defend,"" the likes of Mark Jackson would regurgitate late in games. You aren't All Defense because you start trying on that end late in the 4th quarter, when you ""lockdown"" the final 5% of a game's possessions. We know this for a fact now and analytics bear that out.   It's fitting that a guy who scammed his way into All Defensive teams eventually was handed a fucking Oscar."
"I started supporting the Timberwolves as a meme because of Andrew Wiggins being on a max there (I'm from New Zealand, so no geographical ties to any club)  Now the whole team has become a meme"
"Javale had to play smarter or he was out the league, they also were playing with the maybe  best team ever and easily they most intelligent groups of players on one team. Wise man is out there running a difficult offence wit Kelly Unte and Andrew Wiggins bro. Not even fucking comparable."
I just realized I had no idea what Andrew Wiggins sounded like
Andrew Wiggins kind of looks like Michael Cera
Andrew ‚ÄòThe GOAT‚Äô Wiggins against OKC. Especially when he played for the Timberwolves. He would torch us every damn time. He‚Äôd go toe to toe against Russ and PG. Every time I‚Äôd see that our next game was against the Wolves I just knew the GOAT would do his thing.
Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins
Wat.  The only thing I claimed is that Thibs traded Lavine when he could have traded Wiggins. That was the initial interest: https://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/15/jimmy-butler-trade-bulls-timberwolves-andrew-wiggins  The replier asserted that Thibs wanted to trade Wiggins but ownership wanted to trade Lavine. That has no basis whatsoever.   But go off I guess.
&gt;Maybe like Jaylen Brown is becoming what Andrew Wiggins should have been.
I can also say andrew wiggins would beat Michael Jordan 1 on 1 and you can do nothing to refute it because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù but you can use your brain to apply context like any sane person would to come to the conclusion that jordan would win
"&gt; Steph has 240% more than 2nd leading 3PT shooter Andrew Wiggins, who's got 135  This is incorrect. Steph has 140% more than Wiggins.  Writing ‚Äúx% more than y‚Äù means ‚Äú(1 + x/100)y‚Äù.  For example, 0% more would be the same number, 50% more would be 1.5 times as many, 100% more would be twice as many, and 200% more would be three times as many.  Steph has 2.4 times as many as Wiggins, so that is 140% more."
"His family fled Sudan and received political asylum in the UK. He's a British citizen, and much like many other non-American NBA players only came to the US for basketball.  They still claim their home countries.   Embiid moved at 16 for bball. Luc Mbah a Moute. Andrew Wiggins. Ben Simmons.  Monteverde Academy in Florida is a major pipeline for international players."
You dont think 26 / 15 is better than glorified Andrew Wiggins?
Did Andrew Wiggins die?
"Tons of kids had hype like that, man. Andrew Wiggins was going to be the next LeBron."
Andrew Wiggins hasn‚Äôt had a bad career
"Having had Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett on my team the last few years, this was a pleasant discovery."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.minnesotasportsfan.com/warriors-organization-reminds-andrew-wiggins-of-timberwolves-under-tom-thibodeau/amp/   There‚Äôs also a story with Thibs praising Wiggins and his growth. They‚Äôve got respect for each other. One sore thumb
Should be expected when your best player youve ever played a full season with was Andrew Wiggins.
"Andrew Wiggins would make a really good HR manager for an organization when he retires.  So chill, step into the comfiest office in the league. Cassie lying in the corner waiting for pets."
"&gt;Butler played in 59 games and went 37-22, which means the Wolves went 8-13 without him,  Because the third best player on that team was Andrew Wiggins and the 4th Jeff Teague lol. Thibs created a dogshit roster.  &gt;if I remember correctly this was the year that Butler got hurt late and then the Wolves slid in the standings and Butler had to rush back from injury to help the team win the last few games of the season and make it into the playoffs as an 8 seed  Yeah and then he ghosted the team and demanded a trade. Real leader!"
"Thibs is a great coach, he stepped on his dick with the VP/GM title and bringing in a bunch of washed bulls. The dude traded Zach Lavine instead of Andrew Wiggins. If you want to shit on the team, cool, but at least know what you‚Äôre talking about first."
"Wolves fans didn‚Äôt deserve what happen, but Minnesota the franchise absolutely did.  Glen Taylor interferes with the front office, preventing Thibodeau from trading Andrew Wiggins. He also fucked over KG, someone Butler looks up to, out of his promised ownership of the franchise.   Then KAT was rebelling against Thibodeau‚Äôs coaching, telling the team they should play defense like his Kentucky team did and not listening to any of the veterans on the team trying to get him to play defense the right way.  This is what led to Butler wanting out.  Thibodeau deserves some blame for not finding a trade during the summer, but it‚Äôs hard to blame him from wanting to keep Butler, since Butler and KAT is a super talented duo who could win a championship if they could pull the best version of KAT out of himself."
"If Warriors sneak into the Playoffs I think Andrew Wiggins is going to be the most underrated player in the Playoffs because the changes in gameplay seen in the Playoffs are conducive to Wiggins strengths as a mid range operator and his 1v1 defence has improved immensely (2nd in league for OPP FG% at one stage this season, still up there).  He is a guy who relishes  pull up mid range shots and in the Playoffs that‚Äôs the shot teams are willing to give up defensively. I think his offensive game has some similarities to Kawhi in this sense (obviously not as talented as Kawhi) and he can capitalise in some similar ways.   Defensively this year Wiggins has been a guy that‚Äôs taken the opponents best perimeter player and had taken a few scalps defensively this year (Brandon Ingram in the recent mini series with Pelicans). In the Playoffs there will be a greater value on this ability to keep as tight a lid as can be expected on the elite perimeter scoring talent in the league these days.     Tl;dr: Kawhi‚Äôs game/strengths is more suited to ‚ÄúPlayoff‚Äù style basketball and Andrew Wiggins‚Äô strengths this year have been similar so he can be a store brand Kawhi style player in the Playoffs"
Ya imagine if they get a phenom prospect like Andrew Wiggins or something....Wolves spooky and all that
Player A is def a better offensive player. Cj McCollum vs Andrew Wiggins
Player A is CJ McCollum last year  Player B is Andrew Wiggins this year
"Andrew ""2 'Snickerdoodles' Way"" Wiggins"
"jameer was bigger, but point taken. hell, cp3 is pretty small.  what I really mean is that isn't not like IT can fall back onto other skills. he's not a 6'8"" Andrew Wiggins who is he tried harder could rebound or defend at a high level. IT's size means he's going to do what he's best at (score), and if that doesn't work he probably doesn't have much else. Jameer, again who was a little bigger, was a 3pt shooting playmaker. that was his game  and actually I just realized in my original post that's what I said =&gt; ""small scoring guards"". not all small guards are scorers, but if you're a small guard that primarily scores it's going to be hard to change that role later in your career"
"Andrew Wiggins has played every game this season, is he an MVP candidate?"
"Has KAT proven he can lead a team yet? No. But it‚Äôs also hard to do that when your best teammates the last couple of years have been Andrew Wiggins, 40 odd games of DLo and Malik Beasley, a 19 year old rookie and Ricky Rubio."
"SAS in 44 weeks: ""He should have put his head down and got to work like Andrew Wiggins"""
The fact that his only consistent help has been Andrew Wiggins is pretty wack
"i personally have it #2. my top 5 is john wall, austin rivers, aquille carr, andrew wiggins, Josh Selby"
Him and Andrew Wiggins have the most goated hoop mixtapes of all time
"Simmons on offence reminds me of Andrew Wiggins, if you swap the scoring ability for passing. Just offering absolutely nothing off the ball."
"Ben Simmons: 3 time All-Star, 2 time All-Defense, 1 time All-NBA, RoY  Andrew Wiggins: RoY  I understand that it's peak hot take time right now, but comparing Simmons with Wiggins is just dumb."
"andrew wiggins is not that guy, pal. he‚Äôs not that guy. the added shooting is not gonna make up for the collapse in playmaking. wiggins cant dribble"
SGA/RJ Barrett/Lu Dort/Andrew Wiggins/Dillon Brooks
okay so we‚Äôre all gonna pretend Andrew Wiggins isn‚Äôt Canadian?
"It‚Äôs a joke bruh, relax. And I‚Äôm sure they were saying the same thing about Andrew Wiggins, and how long did he stick around?"
1 Andrew Wiggins and filler
I hate to break it to you but Ant was worse defensively than LaMelo for the season AND during Ball‚Äôs ‚Äúawful‚Äù stretch.   And it wasn‚Äôt like Ant was Steph Curry - his TS% in his amazing second half was .001 better than Andrew Wiggins ü§£ü§£ü§£
Andrew Wiggins
If Andrew Wiggins tore his ACL he'd never walk again
"He was never even close to that level or on that trajectory. Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards are the guys most likely to dominate the league like Lebron imo.   Guys like Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins, and Giannis are not that."
"He‚Äôs andrew wiggins with less talent and better hustle (Not great hustle, just better than Wiggins which can be said of much of the general population). Very replaceable type of guy except for every 7th game where he turns into a borderline (x4) all star"
"Terrible front office. Their core players used to be KAT, Zach Lavine, Andrew Wiggins and Ricky Rubio. Zach Lavine (post Achilles tear season) and Andrew Wiggins both improved tremendously almost instantly after leaving Minny and iirc Ricky did as well although can‚Äôt remember for sure. Says something about their coaching and roster construction if players all improve after leaving. There‚Äôs a reason SPOOKY wolves became a copypasta, the potential has always been there but wolves just can‚Äôt put it together."
"One thing I've noticed is every team thinks they have an all defense guy even if they're just slightly above average or noticeable from the eye test.   Dillon Brooks for Memphis, Andrew Wiggins on the warriors, Dennis Schroeder on the Lakers. There's only ten spots guys"
Andrew Wiggins
Andrew wiggins seems to have no passion for winning basketball.
This seems like troll bait to chest thump about Andrew Wiggins not totally sucking on defense for the first time in his career.
"Who‚Äôs y‚Äôall third team? Dejounte Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Capela is mine I think"
Damn.. only one vote for Andrew Wiggins
"Analytics for shooting is basically ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt make a shot, don‚Äôt take it.‚Äù  It‚Äôs using statistics to help players make a good decision. Players like Andrew Wiggins should not be taking mid range shots because they hit them at the same rate as threes, you may as well get the extra point if you‚Äôre going to shoot 38%. Players like the ones you mentioned are free to shoot away, because they can actually hit mid-range shots.  Anti-analytics people will whine about ‚Äúeveryone just bricks threes now‚Äù, but how is that any less aesthetically appealing than the midrange bricking of the 2000s? It‚Äôs the same shit moved back five feet. There‚Äôs also a middle ground between four-outs and teams taking a lot of threes, the Jazz were one of the best three point shooting teams in the regular season but they still have great ball movement and an inside game."
I forgot about that Ralph Sampson team. Never thought of that as between Hakeem and MJ.   I just looked up the team and Andrew Wiggins' dad was on it.
"I remember people calling Andrew Wiggins ""Maple Jordan."""
"Zion = The Big Easy  Ben Simmons = Ben Kenobi (because of his Jedi force field that keeps all defenders 5 feet away on the perimeter)  Kawhi Leonard = Wi-Fi (because he's awesome until he decides to take a break on you)  Deandre Ayton = The Anomaly (per some writer on the Atlantic who called him an ""anomaly"" in his scouting report pre draft)  Markelle Fultz = MH370 (because his game disappeared and no one's sure why)  Luka Doncic = The Puppet Master (per Gilbert Arenas)  Andrew Wiggins = Adrian (his biggest youtube clip is a prankster asking him if his name is Adrian, which says a lot)"
"Like for example, a 25 pt game from Jimmy Butler is different from a 25 pt game from Andrew Wiggins. They can both have identical stat lines, but the feel and impact are different from the two players."
Andrew ‚Äúmaple jordan‚Äù wiggins ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
Okafor actually carved a solid career as a borderline starter and solid backup for about a decade.  Andrew Wiggins would be in the same boat if we're including Okafor imo. A season and a half of good production for the Warriors doesn't erase the fact that he sleepwalked through his Wolves years pretty much.
Does Paul George actually fucking do anything on offense when the ball isn't in his hand? Dude is just standing there making Minny Andrew Wiggins look like fucking Steph Curry.
Does PG move without the ball??!?!  Dude is like Minny Andrew Wiggins out there.
"Two players can‚Äôt win anything by themselves, bub. Not even if you throw in Andrew Wiggins."
"Plus y‚Äôall drafted the unstoppable big 3 of Kyrie Irving, Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins those years."
"Steph Curry is literally maybe the best point guard and one of the most influential players of all time. His right hand man this season was Andrew Wiggins. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I agree Rudy‚Äôs defense is difference making, but there aren‚Äôt many players I‚Äôm taking over Steph as my franchise player, even historically"
If they want to move on from PG we've got a slightly used Andrew Wiggins to offer.
Paul George is Andrew Wiggins without the killer smile
Paul George is Andrew Wiggins with a decent signature shoe
So you‚Äôre gonna tell me you‚Äôre happy with PG13   We‚Äôre talking about Jordan Ckarkson here dude.... not some MVP Caliber player which PG13 has been   If you don‚Äôt think PG13 has been disappointing then you‚Äôre probably the kinda Warriors Fan that probably thinks Andrew Wiggins is an all star caliber player
"I imagine Andrew Wiggins waking up from a nap like ‚Äúlet me make this post so I can get this $1,500 check real quick."
"That last question is Andrew Wiggins career in his early 20s in a nutshell lol  A lot of people have the perception of him that he's just a physically &amp; athletically gifted dude that treats pro basketball like we treat our normal dayjob.  He's the spawn of a former NBA pro and an Olympic track athlete. He pretty much had no choice but to become a pro athlete and things like this portray it so much hahah.  Don't get me wrong, I know that's just how things look on the surface &amp; I'm happy he seems to be really motivated again in GS especially on the defensive end."
Marcus Smart is not better than Clint Capela or Andrew Wiggins
"Ohhh, my bad lol.   &gt;I'm just saying it's completely different from LeBrons superteams.  Yeah it's different in that KD wasn't traded to Golden State. Not sure how that is better though? AD was traded for the 4th pick, an All-Star, and then some. Kevin Love was traded for Andrew Wiggins(highly valued at the time lol). Not saying it's worse either. Neither Golden State or KD had any obligation to compensate OKC for KD leaving. Just saying that it's still superteam buidling."
"I said it in another comment, but I give those kind of talks no weight. You‚Äôre predicting a team with Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, and Jordan Poole ‚Äî who a lot of Warrior fans like ‚Äî to be worse than a Sixers team that was actively trying to lose games.  It doesn‚Äôt work like that when it‚Äôs actually played out."
"Looking back at the 2014 Draft and 2014/2015 Rookie Class.  \#1 Draft Pick - Andrew Wiggins  Rookie of the Year - Andrew Wiggins  All Stars - Joel Embiid (2018-2021), Nikola Jokic (2019-2021), Zach LaVine (2021), Julius Randle (2021)  MVP - Nikola Jokic (2021)"
"famous G Leaguers Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre, Jordan Poole(he WAS a GLeague player, he's a very good NBA level talent now), Kent Bazemore"
"&gt;His second option was Andrew Wiggins and his third was Juan Toscano-Anderson.  Toscano-Anderson was 11th on the team in FGA, 13th in FGA per game and 7th/6th in minutes/mpg. He wasn't remotely close to being the 3rd option. That was pretty easily Oubre or Wiseman, for whatever that's worth."
He turns into Andrew Wiggins come playoffs. At least Wiggins has the sense to not keep chucking.
"&gt; Yeah and Mitch McGary has a higher PER than Andrew Wiggins. Doesn't mean much.  LMAO, PER might've really been onto something"
Andrew Wiggins
"I think the answer for sure is KAT, Andrew Wiggins (minus recent years,) and here's one people didn't mention: Wesley Johnson  Bonus NFL answer: Jay Cutler."
It would have to be something insane like Joel embiid wanting out and the warriors getting him for Andrew Wiggins + all the picks
"KD goes back to the Warriors by eating Andrew Wiggins, thus replacing Wiggins and his contract on the Warriors payroll."
"Andrew Wiggins got a max, Kevin Love got a max way after his prime, Klay got a max. I don‚Äôt think dollar amount determines how dumb some FOs are."
Supercharged andrew Wiggins is one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve seen on this sub and I‚Äôve seen dumb things
"Don‚Äôt like how he did the Spurs, and Greg Popovich, quit on them and then went to Toronto and got overrated from winning a title against Steph and bums. Doesn‚Äôt uplift teammates or make them better, he‚Äôs a super charged Andrew Wiggins. Tried to break up the raptors by trying to force them to trade their core for another small star. Leads teams on in free agency and waits till all good free agents are gone before signing. I mean he just comes across as a shady individual"
Rumor is LeBron to GSW for Andrew Wiggins. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Why do you make excuses for Lebron but ignore the fact that Steph's next best teammate was Andrew Wiggins? Both players had shitty teams, just like you have shitty opinions"
Neither of Trae young or Luka Doncic are going to turn into Andrew wiggins lmao....
After this season I feel like Andrew Wiggins' contract is better than KP's. Am I taking crazy pills?
RJ Barrett will be what we expected Andrew Wiggins to be
Andrew wiggins
"Ceiling: Paul Pierce. Floor: Andrew Wiggins. Very promising second year improvement, after a rookie year when he looked like another Stanley Johnson."
Andrew Wiggins and CJ McCollum make basically the same money. Which of these players would any fan of another team want first knowing the contracts are all at least 3 years guaranteed depending on player option.  Who is the most tradable?
Like what seems to happen with Andrew Wiggins.
A 3 and D guy or best case scenario a little better than Andrew Wiggins on both ends.
"Who is going to take on that contract?   Two players on the trading block matching in salaries are CJ McCollum, and the don‚Äôt want Porzingis, and Andrew Wiggins, who is more intriguing as a swap in terms of how GS play."
I‚Äôm sorry but is Paul George just not a slightly better Andrew Wiggins by numbers ?
"It makes a bunch of sense if you actually think about how roster construction goes. If Andrew wiggins leaves the Warriors in FA, they gain 0 cap space. So wether he is on or off the team, they gain 0 ways of improving the team. His salary is actually a good thing to have so they can trade for another max contract player, or several smaller salaries. They want to keep his salary as long as possible because if he walks, they get nothing in return."
Andrew Wiggins does exist lol
"I mean the player you're describing is basically Andrew Wiggins, and Andrew Wiggins is never going to make an All-NBA team either"
They will take Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman and our FRP in a sign and trade for Kawhi and they will like it  But in all seriousness they need to make big moves since the last two years clearly prove they won't win a chip with the roster if this happens
"&gt; Players that put up huge stats on shit teams are obviously incredible players.   Not always.  I agree with the assessment that someone has to get those stats and if you're the leading scorer on an awful team, there are times where you're probably more of a role player on a really good team.  I think that Kuzma can be the leading scorer on a bad team, but only a role player on a good team.  Other examples are Drummond, Jerami Grant, and Andrew Wiggins."
Andrew Wiggins would never
Yes come get Andrew Wiggins
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn‚Äôt often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn‚Äôt too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty confident‚Äù the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry‚Äôs closing title window.  ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,‚Äù said Myers, the president of basketball operations. ‚ÄúThose people don‚Äôt come along too often.‚Äù  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season‚Äôs roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart‚Äôs expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season‚Äôs Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that‚Äôd be bad business ‚Äî selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That‚Äôs why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Myers said. ‚ÄúI think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don‚Äôt want to trade James Wiseman. I think he‚Äôs a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.‚Äù  It‚Äôs naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D‚ÄôAngelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized ‚Äî Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota‚Äôs 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren‚Äôt obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can‚Äôt say it and shouldn‚Äôt say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other‚Äôs timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can‚Äôt-miss deal won‚Äôt arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  ‚ÄúWe really hope and think that he‚Äôll be available for that,‚Äù Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it‚Äôll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors‚Äô own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It‚Äôll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn‚Äôt dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it‚Äôs clear, if that‚Äôs the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  ‚ÄúI do think young players can help,‚Äù Myers said. ‚ÄúIt depends on when or how.‚Äù  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won‚Äôt populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  ‚ÄúI do know we need veterans,‚Äù Myers said. ‚ÄúWe have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We‚Äôre well aware of that. We‚Äôll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn‚Äôt as if that mindset didn‚Äôt exist. It doesn‚Äôt matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson‚Äôs) injury that they thought they could win it more and that‚Äôs fair to them.‚Äù  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  ‚ÄúThe ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,‚Äù Myers said. ‚ÄúGuys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
"not quite andrew wiggins good from 3, but luka can definitely chuck with the best of them"
"Wiseman, Minnesota draft pick, and Kelly Oubre for Bradley Beal. Play Bradley Beal at the small forward, Play Andrew Wiggins at the power forward, and Draymond Green at center. That‚Äôs a fucking amazing team."
"Wiseman, Minnesota draft pick, and Kelly Oubre for Bradley Beal. Play Bradley Beal at the small forward, Play Andrew Wiggins at the power forward, and Draymond Green at center. That‚Äôs a fucking amazing team."
"Well see just because someone has the same last name, does not mean they are related.  He's not related to Andrew Wiggins."
"And you act like curry has ever carried a team. What carry job has curry pulled? Delusional fanboys at its best.  Curry without a superteam has been out of the playoffs b2b years so what is this ""carry"" job you speak of that kawhi couldn't do?  Oh and Gleaguers. Warrior fans *cough* curry fans really are the worst aren't they. Apparently draymond an all nba player multiple time and all star multiple time is a G league player now, he's only averaging 9 rebs and 9 assists a game while playin top 3 def in the league. What a Bum, send him to the G league with Jeremy lin!!!  Andrew Wiggins, a career 20+ ppg scorer since his 2nd year in the league Is a G league player as well! The #1 overall pick is such a bum.  Kelly oubre averaged 19 last year with the suns, he was good for the gsw as well before he got hurt but obviously he's ass too according to curry fanboys.  Jordan Poole is 1 of the best young player but let's just pretend he's ass too, he only torched the g league.  Curry has carried the gsw to b2b early vacations. Kawhi def can't do that. Ouch. Facts hurt."
"Present management is definitely leaving some to be desired. However those top 10 picks, it seems like every year our top 10 pick falls outside the group of solid players at the top of the draft. I like the 3 guys we picked early. But none seemed ready to make them a top tier team.   Also noted that the guys the previous management picked haven‚Äôt exactly been stellar players for other teams either. Transitioning from lebron and Kyrie to Anthony bennett and Andrew Wiggins isn‚Äôt exactly a dream scenario either haha"
"Trading Wiggins is a huge mistake. The Warriors need Wiggins and honestly, there's no one else they can go get to replace him. He can score, defend, decent passer, selfless, team first player, willing to do the dirty work, and most importantly, you ALREADY HAVE HIM. Andrew Wiggins is a guy that plugs holes. Andrew Wiggins is a guy that lets you kinda sorta get back to how the Warriors looked before their team imploded from injuries. It's like the good ol' days with Harrison Barnes except I don't think Wiggins disappears in big moments like Barnes did. Wiggins has been rock solid 85% of the season."
"I‚Äôd argue because the lack of spacing. Instead of Andrew Wiggins/Draymond/Jordan Poole to pass to, he can get them to PG, Morris, and Batum, all great floor spacers"
"If you factor in defense, he‚Äôs really about the same level as a guy like Andrew Wiggins... traaaaaade?"
The fact that Steph fans consider Andrew Wiggins a scrub that doesn't help with spacing. While also saying CJ McCollum and the corpse of Carmelo Anthony are world beaters giving Dame tons of help is more delusional but you do you.  I don't think Dames better I just put them in the same tier btw.
"I think even just a semi-competent wing would push this team a long way. Like not even an all star, even someone in like the Andrew Wiggins tier would propel this team so far forward. Portland hasn‚Äôt had a quality SF/PF since Batum left"
"Unless CJ wins the next two games for Portland, I'd say he needs to go.  Powell is a better fit next to Dame and Portland needs a legit wing.    At this point, Andrew Wiggins might even better than CJ due to providing defense.  I wouldn't fire Stotts.  He only has one year left on his contract so I'd just let the new team run things from there.  If Stotts sucks with the new team, don't renew his contract.  If he does well, it was the roster construction the entire time."
"Without AD, he's just an Akron Andrew Wiggins."
"for sure, the draft cycle definitely pushes towards the outliers and puts unreasonable/unrealistic comparisons on players while also severely misjudging what the expected return is from a pick.  Like, we got a 98th percentile outcome on LeBron's career.  He was better than he was hyped up to be and was indestructible for 15 solid years.  Getting Blake Griffin as an outcome when you could have Anthony Bennett/Markelle Fultz/Greg Oden/Andrew Wiggins is something NBA GMs would do 100 times out of 100.  I think Blake got hate from players in the league early in his career because he was trying to end people's lives with dunks and played a super physical style that rubbed people the wrong way, also he became a super famous star before he'd ""done anything"" in the league.  Once he was established and developed his skills, then the Clippers were annoying (Doc/Blake/CP3/JJ Redick whining for calls incessantly was seriously brutal to watch) and hyped and ultimately not winning gave the haters plenty of fodder.  All of that overshadows stretches where Blake was a force of nature and carried those Clipper teams to wins night after night.  That run on the Clippers is so overshadowed I've literally had to get in arguments on r/nba where people were saying his Detroit season in 2019 was the best of his career (nephews, please)."
"Again, this would not have been an issue if they didn't max a mediocre player in Andrew Wiggins because he met with the owner and promised he would get better."
And that situation would have never happened if they didn't max a mediocre player in Andrew Wiggins üëç
"Got it. So it is indeed Jimmy Butler's fault that the Timberwolves decided to max Andrew Wiggins, who was a mediocre player. Keep in mind this decision to max Wiggins was made because he met with the owner and promised he'd get better üëç"
&gt;Because they strapped themselves by maxing Andrew Wiggins. I assume that was also Jimmy Butler's fault?  And he didn't want to wait till the off-season to be extended with his bird rights. Clearly his fault.  Even if we traded Wiggins instead of Lavine we'd still have no money due to needed to pay Lavine.
&gt;It's the maximum offer the Wolves can give under league rules  Because they strapped themselves by giving Andrew Wiggins a max extension. I assume that was also Jimmy Butler's fault?
"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know who ‚ÄòLucky is...‚Äù - Andrew Wiggins, probably"
I think Nurk is the second best player on the Blazers. Harris might be better than Simmons at this point. I‚Äôd probably do a lineup of:  Kyrie Irving  Jrue Holiday  Andrew Wiggins  Kyle Anderson (or any 3&amp;D PF)  Ayton
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Jahlil Okafor  C: Enes Kanter
PG: Patrick Beverly  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Domantas Sabonis  C:  Derrick Favors or Andre Drummond
"andrew wiggins has never made an all star team  he puts up solid numbers too, just the timberwolves are usually bad and wiggins always took a lot of the blame for that  I think he can make an all star game with the warriors if he gets his volume stats up a tiny bit"
"Andrew Wiggins, I thought he would be the best Canadian player since Nash and literally ""Maple Jordan,"" but it wasn't even close. Turns out it was just draft hype and he didn't even play for team Canada until now."
bro is a worse version of andrew wiggins
"My sentence was worded badly so let me explain. Luka is Cade‚Äôs pro comparison, I‚Äôve also seen Tatum as a pro comparison for Cade, right? Andrew Wiggins pro comparison was Tracy McGrady but yet he turned out to be a role player. Basically what I‚Äôm saying is, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to trade away the number one pick in Cade when those are his comparisons. ‚ÄúBecause Andrew Wiggins‚Äù means that it doesn‚Äôt make sense to trade up for Cade because we‚Äôve seen number one picks with all time pro comparisons flop. Get it now? My sentence was worded badly so that‚Äôs on me."
"&gt;  it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for the Thunder to trade SGA and a bunch of picks for Cade because Andrew Wiggins and you already have a star in SGA.  You had me up to here.  You go from comparing Cade to Luka, to comparing Cade to Wiggins.  Which is it?  Is Cade the next Luka or Wiggins"
"Warriors get:   * Kawhi Leonard   Clippers get:   * Andrew Wiggins  * James Wiseman  * 7,14 picks   * 2023 1st  * 2025 1st   * 1,000,000 lbs of the finest cocaine money can buy, shipped directly from Lacob‚Äôs Venezuelan plantation"
Man I wish Andrew Wiggins was top 5 right now
Andrew Wiggins.  So many people have said he‚Äôs underrated that he‚Äôs now overrated. Just because he‚Äôs not horrible doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs good.
Andrew Wiggins
"I'm not arguing that people are saying he'll be as good as Kobe. I'm saying  Booker's playstyle doesn't warrant a comparison to Kobe aside from a few moves he emulates (as most players do).   I mean you're agreeing he doesn't have similar handles, finishing ability, defense or athleticism as Kobe. So literally he has a few moves that he learned from watching/studying Kobe and pulls them out sometimes. That's about it. Should we start calling Andrew Wiggins the next Kobe Bryant as well? The media absolutely drew this up for a reason... clicks clicks clicks."
There's this guy named Andrew Wiggins?
They already have Andrew Wiggins. Barnes's position isn't where they need help.
Don't know. I mean. Wasn't luka Euro MVP before even getting to the NBA? And man. Andrew Wiggins should be a 1 star
"His #2 was Andrew Wiggins w/ Kent Bazemore and Kevin Looney in the starting lineup with Oubre out. Not to mention GSW had barely any depth on their roster at all.  Against the Lakers w/ LB &amp; AD in, he dropped 37/7/3 and it was a 3pt loss.  Against the Grizzlies he dropped 39/4/5 w/ 3 steals. Grizzlies had like 8 guys basically at double figures (Anderson and Valanciunus had 9 pts each) for scoring.  The fact that they had a positive season with that squad in the West (let's not forget Curry was season scoring leader) and almost beat the Lakers who at the time were the most likely candidate for a championship outside the Nets is impressive if anything.  The only people who will view Curry negatively are people who don't understand context or basketball in general."
For a second I thought you meant Jarrett culver and Andrew Wiggins‚Ä¶ than I realized this is Milwaukee not Minnesota‚Ä¶
"Andrew Wiggins is a fair comp, if we‚Äôre talking Kobe in his 20s."
"Why you gotta bring race into it? All I‚Äôm saying is that Wiseman, a very raw prospect with a huge upside, was an odd choice for a team whose competitive window with their championship winning core is time limited. And claiming that the Warriors wouldn‚Äôt trade for a ‚Äúknown loser‚Äù in Dame when they literally traded for Andrew Wiggins, who had done nothing in his career but put up empty, inefficient stats on shitty teams, is also pretty weird"
Andrew Wiggins &gt; Allen Iverson ^(/s)
He could not be paid more and contracts scale with the cap.  You're here uttering nonsense.  There are three tiers of max contracts based on years in the league and accolades.  Andrew Wiggins received the highest salary was eligible to earn.
"Jae is a better 3PT shooter and defender than Wiggins. Andrew is a better ball handler and shot creator, but his poor passing and inefficiency makes those abilities much less valuable.            Regardless, that comment still hold true even if you ommit 1 or 2 names from it."
Andrew Wiggins
"What are you on, man? Is he overpaid, yes? But he‚Äôs not average. 20/2/5 with 52/38/71 shooting split and solid defence is a good basketball player.  Andrew Wiggins is good not great not average. He‚Äôs just not as good as everyone anticipated in his draft year. You could absolutely win a championship with him as your third option. We‚Äôd speak about him different if he was being paid $15m instead of $30m"
Ah yes Andrew Wiggins is the reason Wolves can't succeed üòÇ
"Draymond is going to be an elite defensive anchor on any team regardless of who he plays next to.                     You don‚Äôt think Warriors would rather either pay him what he is worth (instead of the absurd tax they are paying for him right now) or if they are paying the tax, they actually pay it for someone worth it?           To me, Wiggins is a place holder on the Warriors. They know they need to strengthen the squad, and the main allure of Andrew is that he can be used to match salaries."
&gt; I've watched actually watched him play this year unlike you and I've watched him also play for years so I'm more qualified to speak on him than you.  I'm literally Andrew Wiggins I think I've watched my own game more than you have hoe

you wanna trade 2 firsts for andrew wiggins?
Andrew Wiggins (salary match)  James Wiseman  Jordan Poole  2021 1st Rd (#7)  2021 1st Rd (#14)  2022 1st Rd  2023 1st Rd (Pick swap)  2025 1st Rd (Pick swap)  2026 1st Rd  2027 1st Rd (Pick swap)  2028 1st Rd  Is better than what the Sixers can give sorry but it is
"Doug would be an awesome return for Dame but tbh I think we can get a better package, something like Andrew Wiggins and Juan Toscano-Anderson could be in the mix but idk maybe I'm just a homer."
Who out there is good(late round pick)/has the money/wants to spend it on Andrew Wiggins?
Someone post the videos of Andrew Wiggins.
"how do you not know the meaning of something, then when i explain it, you say ‚Äúthen just say‚Äù  lmao  raw talent is not the same thing either  andrew wiggins has more raw talent than 99% players ever but he‚Äôs not better than those guys  greatest is not that subjective  best, yeah"
Also if Klay can look anything like his pre-injury self by the end of next season one Andrew Wiggins starting at the wing is enough to compete.
"Warriors are the new ""gotta fill column inches, time for some fake trade talk"" team.   The Warriors are highly unlikely to trade Andrew Wiggins this off season or next season."
"Andrew Wiggins is also a bust relative to his hype. He was seen as the next GOAT, and everyone was calling him a Kobe LeBron hybrid"

LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
1 Andrew Wiggins
It was strange to be reminded that Embiid and Andrew Wiggins were teammates at Kansas.
"yeah I forgot about warriors package. Wiseman + 7 + 14 + potentially wiggins for salary matching is great      &gt; Plus and here's the really difference -- you don't have to pay a max contract out to Ben Simmons      you would however have to pay a max to Andrew Wiggins, since you can't just swap wiseman who's on a rookie contract and 2 picks for a guard who's on a max"
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre‚Ä¶. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also‚Ä¶. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc‚Ä¶."
"I don't think people seriously considered him a generational prospect more than any other consensus #1 pick. Andrew Wiggins might've had more. In recent memory, after Anthony Davis, I think only Zion was considered a a sure thing. Even Luka went 3rd."
"This is a pretty good move by the Celtics, but it sucks to see him leave.  For those who don't know, Aaron Miles was the HC of the Santa Cruz Warriors from 2017-2019 and Player Development Coach from 2019-21. His Santa Cruz team consisted of Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano-Anderson. This season, he was mainly credited with the improvement of Juan Toscano-Anderson and Andrew Wiggins"
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don‚Äôt pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"Boogie doesnt blow KAT out the water at anything lmao, matter of fact KAT does everything Boogie did just way more efficiently.   I dont blame you, not many people are watching KAT and I only touched on the surface level of what KAT is better at.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Kat on-off in 19-20 was +4.0 ORTg and they were a - on defense. and he had a better team  Boogie's USG that year was literally top 10 ALL TIME compared to KAT who is a low USG player this just tells me Boogie was a high USG player on a bad team, its not impressive putting +4.7 ORtg when KAT is doing basically around that at Net Per 100 +4.0 ORtg with FAR less USG.  Oh and his most competent teammate was Andrew Wiggins, who was seen as the worst contract in the NBA at the time and a washed Jeff Teague. Without KAT that Wolves team.  KAT in 2020 was only marginally a worse defender than Boogie in 2017, neither were good defenders but KAT made up for it by being a far and away better Offensive Player that season   When KAT was on the court in 2019-20 the Wolves were a great offensive team, when he was off the court they were one of the worst offensive teams in the league.   KAT was a Top 10 Offensive player in 2020 and made himself one of the best offensive big man of all time."
"So just as a reminder, Andrew Wiggins was considered a certified defensive stud coming out of college."
Ain‚Äôt no way ingles and Andrew Wiggins starting for an all world team
The Andrew Wiggins strat
"Lets see luka, giannis, joker, joe ingles, andrew wiggins. Wouldnt be too bad"
"&gt; What? He did fucking earn it, or else he wouldn't have landed that contract in the first place.   Really? Then why do people say Andrew Wiggins is overpaid?  Simmons is *ridiculously* overpaid, because he got his contract on the *expectation* that he'd live up to it - including by improving his skills, as NBA players are expected to do.  Instead, he's regressed."
"well CJ is an undersized, bad defender. Andrew Wiggins is a great, long wing defender"
"Seeing the comments below, I‚Äôd like to point out that player development doesn‚Äôt happen in a vacuum. It‚Äôs possible some of these other guys would‚Äôve underachieved if the Cavs drafted em.  Look at Andrew Wiggins. He didn‚Äôt really start performing anywhere near his draft position until GSW  saved him from Minnesota.   Or hell, Cam Payne on OKC/CHI versus PHX right now."
"""there aren‚Äôt many better rebuilding trade packages dangling out there right now than James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts, attached to Andrew Wiggins as salary match filler.""  LMAO. This trade package just kills me. If Portland is trading Dame - and, therefore, completely tanking - why in any sort of fuck would they want to pay Wiggins almost $100 mil for the next three seasons? Wiseman may become a decent fourth or fifth starter on a fringe playoff contender. And, due to the current salary structure of the NBA, any team that traded for him would essentially be committing another $80+ million - at least - to him. So, to give up your all-star who draws money, Portland would be committing $200 million to two guys who would not make up a playoff contender if they were anywhere near your two best players. Unless Dame flat out refuses to ever play for Portland again, the Blazers would be better off keeping Lillard and just putting four cardboard cutouts of players on the court with him."
Deadass it has to be players that Portland are just GIDDY about. This current draft isn't top 10 deep for example. Likely those picks the Warriors will have will be late. I dunno if Andrew Wiggins or and Oubre S&amp;T is compelling enough...
"&gt;James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts, attached to Andrew Wiggins as salary match filler.  Blazers laugh and hang up the phone"
Elaborate‚Ä¶where did I say Andrew Wiggins?
"&gt;there aren‚Äôt many better rebuilding trade packages dangling out there right now than James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts, attached to Andrew Wiggins as salary match filler.  üòÇ there has got to be a better rebuilding package than this. You're telling me that the Celts, 76ers, or Heat can't put together something better than this garbage? Imagine you're a Blazer fan and your team just traded a fringe MVP-caliber player to rebuild around Wiseman, Wiggins, and shitty picks."
That's the stupidest way to say Andrew Wiggins I've ever fucking seen.  That's used car dealer get you in the door type talk.
"&gt; James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts, attached to Andrew Wiggins as salary match filler.   That seems like a lot."
&gt; The ‚Äúrebuilding‚Äù part refers to **investing in young players you hope will pan out**  You really think Andrew Wiggins falls into this category at this point?
Andrew Wiggins doesn‚Äôt even make the list of ‚ÄúWorst players I‚Äôd rather have over Ben Simmons in the last 5 minutes of a tight playoff game‚Äù
"Wiggins is a nice piece. Every team in the league would want a 6'6"" wing who can play defense and get you 16-18 points every night. Athletic wings are probably the most in-demand commodity in the NBA these days, which is why people like Tobias Harris and Andrew Wiggins are on huge contracts, and why some team will probably overpay for Kelly Oubre. Basically every team in the league wants this type of player, even if only for the bench rotation. So yeah, Wiggins is a solid get who can help almost any team in the league. Only issue is the contract, which is going to be restrictive for some teams."
"Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, and rookies is a mediocre team. They can get a better offer for Dame than that  That‚Äôs the kind of team where Portland fans turn on the team for taking that trade and attendance drops."

Andrew Wiggins says hello
I feel like a lot of NBA players have that same mindset.  Andre Drummond seems to have that same mind set. Jabari Parker too. Even better players don't think they need to improve like Ben Simmons and Andrew Wiggins.
"I mean I‚Äôm Greek American and I feel like he should be also known as Nigerian first because that‚Äôs actually what he prefers saying he grew up with his parents Nigerian culture in his house but if we really wanna be specific about it people give these nicknames to players all the time from where they are born, Andrew Wiggins and Jamal Murray both are referred to (in jest) as maple Jordan and maple curry because they were born in Canada but obviously calling someone Canadian isn‚Äôt seen as taking away their ethnicity, it‚Äôs their nationality so that‚Äôs why he just gets called greek freak, it rhymes and it‚Äôs true he‚Äôs a freak. I remember an nfl runningback used to be called the Nigerian nightmare, Giannis could have a cool nickname like that with his ethnicity but Greek freak stuck."

Andrew Wiggins has a good case to be made into the list. He was the next Lebron back then.
"Man, in raw talent, that Kansas freshman class had Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid. It‚Äôs a shame that Joel couldn‚Äôt stay healthy. Wiggins came in as the consensus #1 player, but by the end, every Kansas fan knew Embiid was the better talent, which pretty much meant he was the most talented player in the country. Honestly not surprised that he‚Äôs this good today. He came in with no hype compared to Wiggins and just blew everyone away."
True then Curry would dump it to Draymond who would draw Wiggins defender in and then kick it to Andrew in the corner or wing. All because they had to respect Curry.
He literally almost made the playoffs with Andrew fucking Wiggins and Draymond as his 2 and 3.
Most Draft boards had Andrew Wiggins number 1 and they were proven wrong. Most Draft boards had Jahlil Okafor number 1. Most Draft boards had Markelle Fultz. It's a crap shoot. Especially in a year with no college basketball or workouts 2020 was a hard year to gage.
"His second best offensive player was Andrew Wiggins, bruh."
Says the Raptors fan. You got to watch the mid range connoisseur DeRozan shoot long 2s as opposed to Andrew Wiggins.
Andrew Wiggins
Remember when hyperathletic scoring wing Andrew Wiggins was drafted before Joel Embiid? This is literally the 2014 draft all over again. Do not pass up on Mobley.
"&gt;It absolutely is delusional to suggest a #1 pick who was drafted last season might get traded lmfao        It's not, it's called selling high. You know who else was recently the #1 pick, won ROTY, and had sky-high potential? Ben Simmons! Andrew Wiggins!         &gt;Simmons is a known commodity sure. Known to do fuck all in the playoffs.        Also 1st Team All Defense, All-Star, and has won 50+ games per year every year since his rookie season. If the Minny GM is trying to raise the floor of the team and make the playoffs, he'd consider it."
But I was told Jimmy Butler was a good leader and Andrew Wiggins was weak
Jrue Holiday is just a shorter Andrew Wiggins.

"Mitchell Wiggins was part of the team that beat the Showtime Lakers and did well against the Celtics in the finals,  but Ralph Samson got injured and the guards got suspended.

What if injuries and cocaine hadn't derailed the 1985 Rockets?     We might not have Andrew Wiggins.

Have you Seen Andrew Wiggins practice videos? He's the new Jordan!
"C'mon man. You especially should know for every Lebron James and Kyrie Irving you manage to find you'll get just as many Anthony Bennett's and Andrew Wiggins'. No disrespect to Cade because I'm sure he will kill it but SGA is one of the fastest developing players I've seen in years. And I'm sure the Thunder were ""extra careful"" with keeping him on the sideline this year considering how many games they were winning."
"&gt;KAT he Tim Thibodeau, Andrew Wiggins, and Jimmy Butler on the same team all at the same time and ran them out of town and told them how they used to play defense at Kentucky instead of listening to the coach.   Andrew Wiggins had his worst seasons under Thibs and that team was good only because KAT and Butler were such good players.  That team was also one of the worst defensive teams in the NBA despite Thibs being the GM and creating a roster that he wanted...."
Straight from the soul Andrew Wiggins
&gt;imagine having to choose who to start between Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre.  That's not really a choice
"Dubs fans are not a monolith. However, 90% of r/warriors is entirely deluded and wouldn't trade Andrew Wiggins for anything short of a top 5 superstar.  Far over valuing everyone on the roster is definitely holding up trades"

"I mean, when you look at that list, 4 of those seasons his player played the most minutes in the league. None of them outside of butler 18-19 was lower than 4th most minutes.

"Agreed, but it also depends on what their expectations were. Like Andrew Wiggins has had a decent career, and he's far from a bad player, but he's disappointed immensely from his expectations. Would you call him a bust? I could see the argument for both sides"
"Andrew Wiggins, I'm not afraid to say what we are all thinking.   I will not be intimidated by this sub"

Andrew Wiggins is good.
Andrew Wiggins can still be a top 10 player.
Andrew Wiggins can take his defensive workload . Klay just needs to hit his threes
Yea opponents matter BUT the warriors had terrible comparative TV ratings vs top teams last year without steph. This year they occupy 5 of the top 10 most watched games.  That plus the fact that local ratings rebounded from their 66% drop..speaks to the obvious right? Andrew Wiggins is a superstar duh.  The two articles isn't just looking at national games. It include local viewership too which says a lot.
You think people watched the Warriors last year for Andrew Wiggins lol
"Man, if I picked first overall and got Andrew Wiggins I'd be pretty dissapointed"

Andrew Wiggins plays like the death beams are being aimed at Earth vs OKC
"show me all the times Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant made the playoffs without another All-Star  KAT made the playoffs with Jimmy when KAT was 22.    are you docking him because he couldn‚Äôt get past the 66 win Rockets with Jeff Teague, Derrick Rose, Andrew Wiggins, and pissed off Jimmy Butler?"
"Hmmm, I don‚Äôt think that any NBA scrub would take any college team regardless of the roster to a final 4. However, many above average players like Andrew Wiggins etc. probably could."
Andrew Wiggins - wrecking the Thunder
"I see him as a slightly better Andrew Wiggins.. I think he will prove to be a very valuable player to come, with potential to be a superstar"
What‚Äôs that got to do with being a genius? Sounds more like a very talented player with a poor work ethic (Andrew Wiggins?) rather than a basketball genius.
Steph Curry / Andrew Wiggins / Gordon Hayward / Pascal Siakam / Brook Lopez  Matisse Thybulle
"&gt;	the Raptors have never had an edge signing Canadians  The best Canadian players are still on their 1st or 2nd contracts, like Jamal Murray, SGA, Andrew Wiggins, and RJ Barrett.  The Raptors really haven‚Äôt had any opportunities to sign Canadian star players because until very recently, they didn‚Äôt exist (besides Steve Nash)."
"I went to the KU-Duke game in Chicago in 2013 and all the hype was for Andrew Wiggins vs Jabari Parker. Joel Embiid came off the bench that game. But as the season went on the hype started shifting from Wiggins to Embiid. Particularly after Joel started flashing some low-post moves. I remember Fran Fraschilla being hyped after Embiid's ""Dream Shake.""   So I think Embiid always had pretty good footwork, probably from playing volleyball and soccer growing up. And that combined with being big and strong and naturally talented led to him quickly developing as a basketball player. The scary thing with Embiid is that he's still making huge strides in his improvement as a player. His mid-range improvement last season was pretty remarkable. He just needs to stay healthy."

"Really? Because that Lacob interview where he's crying about the luxury tax seems to say otherwise. I wonder if an owner who thinks the roster isn't championship or bust this year would say , ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt [win a title], then you should look at Joe Lacob and Bob Myers and Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins and say you weren‚Äôt good enough,‚Äù Lacob said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre paying all that money you weren‚Äôt good enough."""
I haven't seen Andrew Wiggins mentioned yet.  He still has $31.5 mil coming his way next season and $33.6 mil in '22-'23 before that contract expires.
5 andrew wiggins would be nice to watch imo
I mean nearly made the playoffs with draymond green and Andrew Wiggins. Give him the 2020 Hawks roster and I‚Äôm sure he does worse than he did with the warriors this year.     I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs as many guys as you think who can take a shit team to the playoffs
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."
2020-21 Warriors MVPs:   1. Steph Curry for being the league's leading scorer 2. D'Angelo Russell for getting traded 3. Andrew Wiggins for becoming an impressive defensive wing 4. Ja Morant for dropping 35 to send the Warriors to the lottery
5 Andrew Wiggins could be the real deal
andrew wiggins woul be the #1 pick pretty much any yearüò≠
"you see ben simmons is definitely better than andrew wiggins, but i feel like people aren‚Äôt recognizing the spacing fit that he and draymond would have together. that shit would be catastrophic."
Ben Simmons is negative value. It's the Andrew Wiggins situation all over again
Andrew Wiggins.   He's so athletic. If he finds the motivation to play at his full potential there's not a lot of defenders who can stop him.
Andrew Wiggins. I still believe in the guy üöÄüôå
"Andrew Wiggins. He‚Äôs a little above a role player, but I thought he‚Äôd be a superstar."
Andrew Wiggins
"&gt;He might be the best 3 point shooting center in the league but he doesn't make anybody around him better.   KAT is the best 3pt shooting Big of all time and one of the best shooters ever in general. KAT is one of the best playmaking bigs in the league, saying he ""cant make his team better"" is just BS and only shows your lack of knowledge on KAT outside of surface level knowledge or how the media views him.  Its clear you dont know anything about who you are talking about, and this isnt the rabbit hole you want to go down.  This season, KAT was averaging 5 assists on a team who had guys like Josh Okogie being a catch and shoot option and Ant being a poor shooter to start his year. KAT playing with better floor spacing and hes averaging at least 7 assists. Dlo, Edwards, and Malik are all either good or elite 3pt shooters and next season I expect people to actually catch on that KAT is a great playmaker.  &gt; I do watch and pay attention his best defense was played during his rookie season and has gotten noticeably worse since then.   Another BS take, KAT is a neutral defensive center that has gotten better every single year on that end and is on a bad defensive team, so he is looking a lot worse on D when his team isnt helping either.  KAT is actually a good defender when he doesnt have all the pressure on him to be the guy on offense.  I find it ridiculous how people will try to discredit KAT for not taking his team to the playoffs when his 2nd option was mainly Andrew Wiggins, a man Steph Curry couldn't lead to the playoffs himself."
Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins. Dude basically never developed past year one or two and now he‚Äôs ideally a ‚Äú3 and D‚Äù guy who can maybe cut to the rim occasionally.
Andrew Wiggins aka Maple Jordan
"No: he really was unstoppable driving to the basket, and a fantastic option in the different fantasy leagues. Did he make better numbers because there wasn‚Äôt anybody else in the team? Yes. But he never was an Andrew Wiggins type of player where shots are made because he‚Äôs the messiah. Dude was really good with mid-range shots and layups."
"Andrew Wiggins. He‚Äôs definitely a solid role player, but he was supposed to be the next Kobe if remember correctly‚Ä¶"
Andrew Wiggins. A better version of Michael Beasley.
Andrew Wiggins.
"Andrew Wiggins I thought was gonna be 8+ time all star, but instead he has just been a starting caliber player who never put it all together."
"If only he had Bam, Dragiƒá and Robinson and not Josh Okogie and Andrew Wiggins"
Andrew Wiggins put up 19/5/2 on .47/.38/.71 with top tier wing defense and there are still people who will swear he's trash.  Even on the Warriors sub I've seen people question if he should start this season.
"If Anthony Bennett was any better the Cavs wouldve had a better 13-14 season record and likely don't get first pick, which means they don't draft Andrew Wiggins (who was seen as the next big superstar at the time lol) and the Kevin love trade doesn't happen. Cavs might not win a ring if this happens."
Andrew Wiggins
Jalen Green and Andrew Wiggins coming into the league. Hopefully Jalen developes better.
"I feel like Sabonis is kinda underrated -- dude just put up an efficient 20/12/7 without a true point guard and playing next to another big man. Still only 25 years old too, tons of room for growth left.  My homer take would be Siakam, based on all the trade speculation around him. I saw people suggesting he's not that big of an upgrade over guys like Andrew Wiggins or Buddy Hield, which I found shocking."
"I think Andrew Wiggins might have had a different fire in his belly if he was drafted by the Toronto Raptors. Maybe.  Likewise, Darko might have been a bust anywhere, but getting to play for any coach at the time OTHER than Larry Brown I think would've sent him on a different trajectory. He had a ton of talent and confidence before Brown wore him down."
"I feel if the right team got Andrew Wiggins, somebody like the Spurs or Warriors from the get go - he wouldn't necessarily become a superstar, but maybe an All Star."
Saying an improved Simmons in a radically different system is only a tiny upgrade over Andrew Wiggins is all I needed to hear LOL  Ig I‚Äôll agree to disagree and move on
"The real question is how great Jabari Parker and Andrew Wiggins are. I think they are only a few years away from being a few years away, some brilliant young stars right their poised to make a splash in the league in several years."
"For once I could sorta see it.   * Lakers are aging.   * Sun's best player is an injury prone guard that is on the tail of his career.   * The nuggets have murray tying up 30% of their cap and he's sidelined for a decent portion of this next year and imo isn't good enough to be a #2 option on a championship team even when fully health.  * The blazers are content being an 8 seed  * the warriors have an aging injury prone core tying up 80% of their cap. Hotcoldman andrew wiggins tying up the rest. And a slew of unproven talent when they refuse to build around Curry and make a legitimate push as his career tapers off.   * The rockets imploded and landed green and now its a rebuilding period  * The pels are zion against the world. You cant convince me that after this many years ingram is going to be the number 2 option reliably. Also letting lonzo walk for nothing is a travesty  * The jazz haven't made any significant strides with their roster and are running it back _again_  * The clips are aging and kawhi is sidlined for the year  * The mavs are luka against the world and have a huge portion of their cap tied up in a role player  * who does that leave? the wolves? lmao. The kings? lmao. The thunder are playing tankathon draft sim and have no aspirations of competing. The spurs unfortunately don't have the talent required to be a threat.   I know its pessimistic and probably going to age badly but the 6ers (what ever haul they get for simmons + their core is going to be solid imo), Nets, Bucks, and Hawks are all imo legitimately better prospectively for the upcoming season than any western team."
"After a near-death experience, Andrew Wiggins has a change of perspective--and fulfills his potential."
Is there a different term that should be used?  Because Andrew Wiggins is definitely a disappointment both for a guy who was as hyped as he was but also for a first overall pick in general.  He's way closer to role player than he is to star.
How the fuck are Len Bias or Andrew Wiggins busts?
Wiggins has played like how we thought Andrew Wiggins would turn out before too. Consistency is the issue.

Right now Kuminga is playing like how we though Andrew Wiggins would turn out.
"The Lakers barely even could win that play in game. Steph carried that team so hard all year, and ended the season with such a historical tear he deserved to win MVP. The team is good defensively, top 5, but is literal fucking trash on offense outside of Curry. Andrew Wiggins was the was the 2nd option all year and is at best a 4th offensive player on a team. He's a purely volume offensive player. Draymond Green is a human boat anchor on offense. If you think Simmons is bad, oh boy, wait till you watch this guy. I guarantee you weren't watching Draymond games without Steph though, so you wouldn't know. Oubre and Bazemore are nice energy guys, but both have low IQs, are bad teammates, inconsistent, and also volume scorers. Again, better on defense than people give them credit for purely by their athletic ability, as they also struggle helping on defense. James Wiseman is great prospect on offense, but was simply unproductive last season. The only two real other offensive threats on the team were Poole down the stretch and JTA who showed out as a bit of a sniper. That team has no business being a middle of the road offense. The fact that Curry was able to lead them to a middle of the road offense instead of dead last with that squad, and the amount of injuries they sustained throughout the season, is truly incredible."

"But Steph had Draymond all and Andrew ""All defense Wiggins"""
Andrew Wiggins is up there
"Wonder if Andrew Wiggins like Philly Cheesesteaks, we already know Ben Simmons like bricks used in buildings in San Francisco"
"Roty winners can peak with that award.  Andrew Wiggins, Micheal Carter williams, Tyreke Evans to name a few.  Not saying LaMelo isn't good, just  overrated and he might have peaked."
"Not famous or the best but I think Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine combined would be an MJ archetype plus a 3-pt shot.  But to answer OP's question, it's Durant-Westbrook for me. It's basically Giannis who can shoot anywhere."
Bro hooping is hooping and we're just talking shit. There's just a smoothness and swagger that reminds me of Tmac is all.     He might be Andrew Wiggins. Who knows?
Forgot Andrew ‚ÄúMaple Jordan‚Äù Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins has always been a good player
"The Lakers roster' make no sense as a single unit and they are not ""clear favorites"" in the West.   Giannis is on the same career trajectory as MJ and LeBron.  Anthony Edwards: I love the person, but think the basketball player is on a path towards never being an actually-effective main/co-main option. Kind of like Andrew Wiggins, ironically."
"Ben Simmons is more valuable than Andrew Wiggins. What he does defensively and with his athleticism is so much more unique in the NBA. Andrew Wiggins as an inefficient scoring forward is a dime a dozen. So that‚Äôs why it would be stupid if the Blazers traded Dame to the Warriors (which is the conversation that led me to this opinion). For all of the flaws Ben Simmons has shown, he is still a player that has upside and skills that are much rarer in the NBA than Wiggins‚Äôs."
"Facts dude, I swear it‚Äôs always warriors clips too  All season last year the front page was of basic clips of Andrew Wiggins doing layups and shit"
"I'm not arguing against his offensive production.  He was already a huge size and defensive liability even pre-injury.  It was already something that was being exploited by teams and being written and discussed about on whether his offensive output can continue to be consistent to make up for his extreme deficiencies on defense:  [""Isaiah Thomas‚Äô defense is a problem the Celtics must keep hiding""](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/4/27/15450024/isaiah-thomas-celtics-defense-playoffs-worst-nba-2017)  [""2017 NBA No-Defense Team, starring Isaiah Thomas, Andrew Wiggins and many more""](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/29/kawakami-my-2017-nba-no-defense-team-starring-isaiah-thomas-andrew-wiggins-and-many-more/)  On a long-term standpoint, you don't pay the max for that kind of player since as he gets older and slows down, his defensive non-existence becomes even more non-ignorable as his offense drops."
You know this sub is in a bad state when statements that Dejounte Murray and Andrew Wiggins are untouchable in a Simmons trade are being upvoted.  It‚Äôs impossible to engage in an honest dialogue around Simmons with the current mob mentality around here.
It's r/nba . Only the last 3 games matter and completely define his career. Dejounte Murray and Andrew Wiggins are better than him now. Get with the program.
"KD, Kyrie, CP3, Booker, Luka, Jokic, etc are ‚Äúhoopers‚Äù. Players with a natural feel for the game who dominate with mostly skill and refined their touch/abilities. ‚ÄúBasketball players‚Äù are guys who are great athletically or are great mostly due to size/strength but struggle in the skill department. Usually, lack natural hoop ability in terms of shot creating, shooting touch, fundamentals, or the ability to have a feel for the game. Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins, Zion, Giannis, etc are ‚ÄúBasketball players‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be great if you aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúhooper‚Äù obviously Shaq and Giannis proved that it‚Äôs just dominating the game in a different way and it‚Äôs basketball lingo. You had to play the game any level either highshool, college, pro am, or something to understand ."
Morey is not going to sell Simmons at a discount when there is a chance Lillard becomes available.  I am talking about when Warriors fans act like James Wiseman or Andrew Wiggins are more coveted players than Simmons.  There are still plenty of teams that are interested in Simmons and he is not getting traded for a bag of beans like this sub thinks he is
"Much better nowadays, but early Timberwolves Andrew Wiggins was a pretty prime example of an empty calories player.  He'd get you 20, but on below average or average at best efficiency, was a subpar rebounder even for a wing, had a negative assist-to-turnover ratio, and wasn't a particularly effective defender."
Andrew Wiggins with more aggression and less skill
high motor Andrew Wiggins
"Andrew Wiggins. Has the length, quickness, and shows glimpses of being able to stick with anyone one on one. But just like his offense it seems the effort and/or instincts aren't there"
"This guy was literally voted best defender in the league last year, is a much better passer/creator than Wiggins, and is such an horrific scorer than he averaged 15.35 points per game the last two seasons on a team that would appear practically designed to be the worst fit imaginable- This is about 3.65 points less than the great Andrew Wiggins' points as a Warrior.  I'm not sure why a team with Steph and Klay would ever in a million years need to worry about spacing. What exactly are you worried about? Heck, there's no reason why Ben couldnt just play the 5 if you're so worried. I mean, I know he doesnt fill up the stat sheet like Kevon Looney, but I think he'd managed..."
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
CJ McCollum  Ben Simmons  Pascal Siakim  Buddy Hield  Andrew Wiggins  Tingus Pingus
"Statistically speaking, Wiggins scoring production prior to being traded is nearly identical to Siakam‚Äôs scoring production this past season and the one before it.  Andrew Wiggins 42 games before the trade (no curry or draymond): 22.4 ppg on 53.5 TS%  Pascal Siakam 2020/21 - 21.4 ppg on 54.7 TS%  Pascal Siakam 2019/20 - 22.9 ppg on 55.4 TS%  Those are very marginal differences"
"Aaron Wiggins is Andrew Wiggins' son.  Man, where does the time go."
"exhibit a: andrew wiggins.  it helps that these guys are not really all that ""bad"" to begin with."
So the Kings are giving up Hield and a lottery protected pick for Andrew Wiggins? Sounds like an awful deal for them
Another thing we can‚Äôt relate to is already having earned 107 million dollars and turning down 30 million as an actual option.  Actually there‚Äôs probably a list of hundreds of other things we can‚Äôt relate to with Andrew Wiggins.
What religion is Andrew Wiggins? A Jehovah witness or something. Guy never really struck me as religious lol

I mean there clearly was some beef between them if Wiggins's brother wrote Hallelujah when Jimmy was being traded and later on Wiggins basically calling him an old ass hater.    https://theundefeated.com/whhw/twitter-exchange-between-timberwolves-andrew-wiggins-jimmy-butler-and-stephen-jackson-had-nba-twitter-on-its-heels/
It‚Äôs so weird that everyone is so focused on Andrew Wiggins through this. Is it just because San fran and NYC are the only ones with mandates to enforce it? If y‚Äôall think Wiggins is the 2nd best player in the league left to be vaccinated y‚Äôall in for a surprise.
Andrew Wiggins does look like a live action eyeroll
"If you honestly think Ben Simmons and Andrew Wiggins have the same value, stop watching basketball."
What even is Andrew Wiggins' religion? Is Kyrie like their priest or what?
"\&gt;""The NBA has reviewed and denied Andrew Wiggins' request for religious exemption from the San Francisco Department of Public Health's order requiring COVID-19 vaccination for all participants age 12 and older at large indoor events,"" the league said in a statement.  &amp;#x200B;  one thing ive been confused on here, how can the league give an exemption to the local municipal mandate?"
"Andrew Wiggins shot selection is really weird. Clearly, he shy away from high percentages"
"What's weird is that his dad, Mitchell Wiggins, was kicked out of the league for violating the rules....just a few months after he made the finals in 1986 with the Akeem-Sampson Rockets.  You would think Andrew understand that the NBA isn't lenient when it comes to certain things, however unfortunately not."

This the most attention Andrew Wiggins will get in his career.
They aren‚Äôt trading Simmons for Andrew fucking Wiggins. Some of you people are fucking brain dead.
Cant simply trade a Andrew Wiggins contract lol
RJ Barrett once again being the better Andrew Wiggins in all facets of life.
"The Sixers asked for Wiggins in the trade deal that fell through just before the Draft. So maybe some new variation of that trade is now in the works. When a teams says that a player won't be availably that usually means that a trade is immanent   Pre-Draft trade offer:  The **Philadelphia 76ers** offered **Ben Simmons** to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for former first overall pick **Andrew Wiggins**, 2020 second overall selection James Wiseman, and four first-rounders, including this year's No. 7 and No. 14 picks."
The only time that Andrew Wiggins has stepped up to be the guy. üò¢
"As we get closer to training camp, I feel like Kyrie Irving is about to become the main headline. As will Andrew Wiggins."
It‚Äôs Schroeder. Dude is crazy fast with the ball. Fox is fast too but Schroeder wins the 100 in the NBA. Who is the fastest 400 runner? Probably Andrew Wiggins.
Frank Gore was an elite RB who made 5 pro bowls. Andrew Wiggins hasn‚Äôt made a single all star game and probably never will.
Interesting. I think that if he doesn‚Äôt have to be vaccinated in Philly this is a no brainer. Dubs can play Draymond at SF and Ben at PF. Do the salaries match?  This article has Seth joining Steph!   https://sportsnaut.com/andrew-wiggins-trade-scenarios/
"I was making the point that even if your vaccinated, you can still transfer it, which you were referring to about Wiggins putting other people at risk.   The vaccine prevents people from dying if they contract the virus. In this case, the vaccine isn‚Äôt a cure, which refutes your point. It‚Äôs impossible to get rid of covid 19, it‚Äôs always going to exist, and it will continue form new variants. Just like your point of small pox, it still exists.   Bringing the point back to Wiggins, If the COVID 19 vaccine prevents you from dying, then why would you worry about Andrew Wiggins being vaccinated? Most people dying are unvaccinated. Do you propose we lock every one down and every one get shots so that we can save the people that are immunoly compromised? Real question. It‚Äôs tough, I saw that the flu is more dangerous, people die from it every year, even young healthy individuals but I don‚Äôt have time to look it up."
"I think if the difference between throwing away your season, and not, is Andrew Wiggins, you may already be in more trouble than you thought."
Andrew Wiggins is right to decline the vaccine.
"Welll, it depends right. Because if Golden State and the Nets get in the playoffs. Suddenly you're missing Andrew Wiggins for potentially 3 games out of a series or Kyrie Irving for 3 games out of the series.  In the East, that might not matter too much depending on how it shakes out, but in the West, they're going to need Andrew Wiggins present to have a shot.  The Nets if they make the Finals however are going to be absolutely hurting if they're down an all-star talent for 3 games out of the series."

"Lance Stroll should be light and day more famous than Andrew Wiggins, and Stroll is, at best, a 2nd tier F1 driver."
"It's Andrew Wiggins, not Alfonso Davies. Canada isn't going to bend the rules for a non factor like him."
I legitimately think I'd rather have Rudy Gay on that team for $6MM than Andrew Wiggins for $29.5MM.

"*knocks on door*  Hello, I'm Andrew Wiggins"
[The Golden State Warriors are concerned about the status of Andrew Wiggins this season for home games as he continues to plan to not receive the COVID-19 vaccine.](https://twitter.com/realgm/status/1440858054526914561?s=21)
Andrew Wiggins doesn't wanna become Andrew Wigggggins /s
You have Andrew Wiggins though‚Ä¶.bro lol.
The Dlo trade was good? What? A lottery pick and Andrew Wiggins for Dlo is objectively not a good trade.  Lamelo over Ant.  Culver move up and pick was not great. Then giving up on him for Pat bev is not great.   The dude isn‚Äôt some mastermind- I‚Äôm not sure why y‚Äôall are so disappointed
"The wolves aren‚Äôt logical. I‚Äôd bet money senile Glen Taylor thought he knew better. This is the man that offered Wiggins the max [if he promised he‚Äôd be a better player.](https://sports.yahoo.com/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html) For all the flack Dolan gets, Taylor is god awful."
"Honestly, Andrew Wiggins seems like a really nice guy. And if I told him my life was on the line, I'm sure I could convince him to half-ass it."
"Eh. My favorite player is Andrew Wiggins cuz the first time I went to an NBA game I saw his picture on the Jumbotron and liked that he had the same name as me. Had no idea who he was at the time  I was like 11. I feel like kids just pick out a player randomly, how good they are or their reputation doesn‚Äôt really matter."
"You didn't even consider the asking price of Simmons. I'm sure the Warriors would love to have him for free. But according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ou5lhj/pompey_the_sixers_asked_for_andrew_wiggins_james/), ""the Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight‚Äôs NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons"""
It's absolutely crazy. If you told someone 1 year ago Ben Simmons couldn't be traded for Andrew Wiggins you'd be looked at like a damn spaceman.
"I get that but really look where they are at.  First of all I like their new GM. Gersson Rosas seems to understand the business well and has done a good job in his tenure with the Wolves. He managed to unload a bad contract in Andrew Wiggins while bringing in a player that is not worse and is very close friends with his face of the franchise, KAT. They drafted probably the most exciting prospect out of the 2020 NBA draft, Anthony Edwards, made the trade for Malik Beasely, and I think we were finally starting to see the results of that.  I know they sucked last season but they finally brought in a real coach last season, Chris Finch, got healthy, and played their best basketball late in the season. Their biggest issue was the defense and Simmons is one of those guys who instantly raises your team's defense.   The spacing issues he had won't really exist with KAT and the way he plays. KAT's kind of the perfect center to pair with Simmons. Simmons is long and athletic, everything D'lo isn't, which is why he's so good in transition. I could see it working well for the team to have Simmons initiate in transition and then have D'lo do so in the half court, perfectly playing to the strengths of both offensively.   Also I think Anyhony Edwards is the real deal, we may reach a point where KAT isn't the best player on the Wolves. You add Simmons to that and all of a sudden you are talking about a roster with a *lot* of talent.   If I'm Rosas and I have to include all my future firsts and swaps if I can bring back Simmons sending out no player better than Malik Beasely I'm making that trade every time."
"&gt;first of all pick any of vanvleet, derrick white, barnes, etc you probably getting the same reaction from philly fans as you are to the minny package.   Ok, that‚Äôs not the point though, the picture is all those potential packages are BETTER than Minnesota‚Äôs potential deal. Idc about the reaction of Philly fans when they finally make a deal    &gt;also simmons is not that young, he‚Äôs 25 and has showed little to no growth since coming into the league.  Yet he‚Äôs still one of the 40 best players in the league despite his lack of OFFENSIVE improvement. (It‚Äôs disingenuous to say he hasn‚Äôt grown).    &gt;even a guy like vanvleet who is older than simmons has improved more over the last couple of years.   And he‚Äôs still worse than Simmons so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to get at.   &gt;and hoping getting a talented a player as simmons? there‚Äôs been quite a few more talented players then ben simmons that were in his draft class and that have come into the league since, there will be every year.   Yes, and it‚Äôs players generally drafted at the top of their class... like Simmons. None of these teams realistically are in, or will be in positions to draft this high. And if they were to add Simmons to their team they sure as hell aren‚Äôt picking that high. Even if they were to have a terrible season and end up in the high lottery this is the exact reason why pick protections exist.    &gt;why take on a good player who is who he is and already might be on his biggest contract of his career (if he doesn‚Äôt improve) when i can draft guys to develop   Because those guys you‚Äôre trying to develop realistically will never be as good as the 25 year old all star DPOY level player that is currently available right now.    &gt;and if i get to the point where i need to pay my young guy you hope that he‚Äôs not the next ben simmons or andrew wiggins (i‚Äôm not comparing ben simmons as a player to wiggins just the max deals they got)  If every young guy on my teams‚Äô roster turns into a ben Simmons caliber player we would have the best team of all time even if you trade everyone else away. I pray the young guys on my team get to that level."

"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"Kirk Cousins and Andrew Wiggins are very similar if you think about it, overpaid minnesota athletes always settling and being consistently mediocre while being gashed by national media and fans, never raising the ceiling or floor of a team, and never taking the vaccine"
"PG: Steph Curry  SG: Paul George  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Draymond Green  C: Anthony Davis  Bench: RoCo, Issac, Lamelo, Mikal Bridges, Myles Turner, Andrew Wiggins, MPJ  My starting lineup is just the 2017 Warriors except I upgraded Klay to PG, downgraded KD to Tatum, and gave them AD to completely destroy their biggest weakness  My bench is just valuable role players mostly 3 and D and Lamelo and MPJ to boost the offense  Gave myself an extra challenge of not putting any borderline stars in here like Fox and SGA. MPJ is the closest and I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs on the other guys level"
"Would Reggie Bush be the Andrew Wiggins? Hyped out of college, never truely lived up to the hype. Played decently though, just never grew into the player that they were hyped to be. I guess Bush never had as much expectations coming to the NFL like Wiggins did getting touted as the next big thing."
Wolves version of Andrew Wiggins and Jadveon Clowney. Inconsistent but had goat genetics and the consensus #1 pick in high school. Got a bag too
Andrew wiggins
"Joining the league in 1990 the Minnesota Timberwolves drafted all time great Kevin Garnett in 1996 and proceeded to have this legend of the sport for his best years until 2007 at which they were able to draft Kevin Love in the 2008 NBA draft who proceeded to give his best All NBA years to the Timberwolves up until 2014 at which point they traded him for the #1 pick in the 2014 draft, Andrew Wiggins as well as selecting future All Star Zach LaVine in the same draft. In the next year Minnesota would proceed to solidify their young core taking the greatest shooting big man of all time Karl Anthony Towns at #1 in the 2015 draft to add to their young core. To provide leadership to this team Minnesota brought on former coach of the year Tom Thibodeau and then traded Zach LaVine for perennial 2 way All Star Jimmy Butler. As the Butler situation soured in early 2019 Minnesota still had their young superstar center and had traded Andrew Wiggins for the young Brooklyn All Star DAngelo Russell. Immediately that 2020 draft Minnesota had the option to draft LaMelo Ball but opted for the young stud Anthony Edwards to create a new star studded young core.   Minnesota Timberwolves all time record: .394 win rate and 9 playoff appearances in 31 seasons."
Rnba: Small market teams need to gamble big on high potential young talent  Rnba: Why in the hell would Minnesota give Andrew Wiggins a massive contract when he hasn't proven enough? It's ruined their situation.  Never mind that Wiggins was a way  safer gamble than JJJ. Rnba is such an amalgamation that we are constantly smart and the dumbest ever at any given moment.
"Andrew Wiggins fits this nicely, came into the league with no handles and an inconsistent shooter still basically is that"
"Andrew Wiggins, he's had ""upside potential"" for years"
Andrew Wiggins and the 18-5-3 has to be up there
"I like how Andrew Wiggins always becomes ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúdecent‚Äù to the fans of the team he‚Äôs on. Meanwhile, those superlatives are usually used in the same context as a trade idea for Andrew Wiggins."
"Hadn't heard about Embiid disproving that stuff. Guess I need to look more into the situation. If it's just the not getting better after the extension, then he basically just pulled an Andrew Wiggins."
"&gt;Considering there is a salary cap floor, which teams MUST spend, why are all contracts guaranteed?  Because unlike most other sports, the NBA's player union is actually strong and competent.   &gt;Eliminating guaranteed contracts will help the NBA operate in a much more competitive manner, and avoid situations like Ben Simmons and Andrew Wiggins, yet the players as a whole will still get all their money.  Yes, taking away employee protections is indeed pretty beneficial to employers."
"Melvin and devin Booker, Gary trent and Gary trent Jr, Larry Nance and Larry Nance Jr, Stan and Kevin love, Mitchell and Andrew Wiggins, doc and Austin rivers, Wes and Wesley matthews, Gary Payton and Gary Payton II, Terry and Ed Davis, there are way more"
"I‚Äôm kinda like that with Andrew Wiggins. He played in Minnesota for years who were almost never on national TV, and then for Golden State the last couple years who, if they were on TV, would come on whenever I had to start getting to bed. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a single minute of him playing I genuinely have no idea what his strengths and weaknesses are or any of that lol. I just know that he didn‚Äôt really live up to his initial expectations from when he entered the league. That‚Äôs really it"
"Especially the ones comparing it to the 2015/16 team with Wiggins as the new Barnes role, but ""better"". While that may be true and Steph might have gotten better, it is dismissing just how deep that team was and how valuable Andrew Bogut's combination of rim protection and passing was. Had guys likeIguodala, Barbosa and Speights still in their prime off the bench and not to mention even a wild card like David Lee they could plug into games to throw off adjustments. Iguodala and Lee were starter type players accepting bench roles. I feel like everyone but OG warrior fans have really have forgotten the whole ""strength in numbers"" thing."
"That's a really good outcome for a #1 pick in an average draft.  You would be pleased if your #1 overall turned out to be a low level all-star player.  Take a look at the last 10 #1 overall picks, and Ben is clearly in the top range.  2010 - John Wall  2011 - Kyrie Irving  2012 - Anthony Davis  2013 - Anthony Bennett  2014 - Andrew Wiggins  2015 - KAT  2016 - Ben Simmons  2017 - Markelle Fultz  2018 - Deandre Ayton  2019 - Zion  Ben would be top 3 or 4 on that list, only Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving I would say are clear cut better than Ben Simmons, and both of those guys have serious injury concerns"
He‚Äôs a super charged Andrew Wiggins. Great player but not on Lukas level
Andrew Wiggins is better than Ben Simmons and Paschal Siakam.
"&gt;their argument always paints Lebron like some sort of bum      Some people can go too far, obviously, but I think a lot of that depends on your perception and realizing the context of the comments. We clown guys like Andrew Wiggins because he's a ""bum"" compared to superstars, but he's obviously better than even most NBA players. Like comments saying people were ""hating"" on Jim Brown for thinking Jerry Rice should've been above him in the NFL 100 rankings. On the over scale, of course Lebron and Jordan are insanely close, but if we're just looking at those 2, their differences can be substantial in a way that doesn't mean one is actually a ""bum."""
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
"Ah yes, the Andrew Wiggins effect.  Ultimately I think draft people really need to start evaluating motor going forward. I don't know if that's something you can teach people."
Andrew Wiggins &gt; Brandon Ingram
"Bradley beal, Andrew wiggins"
"&gt; Even 1st overall picks aren‚Äôt guaranteed tbh.  They aren't *guaranteed* to succeed, but there is such a huge difference between #1 and #2. #1 picks average almost as many win shares as the #2 and #3 combined. Occasionally you get an Anthony Bennett but #1 has a very high likelihood of success.  Since 2000, the #1 pick has been an all star every time except 9 (so 57% all stars) and that's including Ayton who probably *will* be an all star and Anthony Edwards who it's a little too early to tell, but I still included all of them except Cunningham (ie, all of them who have actually played).  Of those 9 who didn't make an all-star game, I would argue there are only 3 true busts.  Kwame Brown: Bust  Anthony Bennett: Bust  Andrea Bargniani: Bust  Andrew Bogut: Still had a good career  Greg Oden: Injuries. If you want to call him a bust you can, but to me it's a little different if the guy's career is derailed by something like that versus just not being a good player.  Markelle Fultz: Injuries  Andrew Wiggins: Still a decent-ish player  DeAndre Ayton: Too early to say but *probably* not a bust. Seems really good actually.  Anthony Edwards: Too early to say"
"Bro one Pick was Anthony fucking Bennett who shat the bed after 2 months of nba. Other one was Andrew Wiggins, traded with Bennett, for K-Love, a good all star, but not more than that, including his mental situation in 2016 when lebron said ""just fit in"". I mean other than Kyrie who was enormous those playoffs, he literally had JR, delly, TT, James Jones as teammates. They won't make the finals those year without him"
This post looks like a copypasta from an Andrew Wiggins post.
Andrew wiggins redemption arc in GS
Andrew Wiggins up until this past season. Actually he was the poster boy for this.
"Speak for yourself. Generally rankings are based on logic and analyzing player abilities, not narratives.   And legacies have nothing to do with current player rankings. Melo has 10x the legacy of a guy like Andrew wiggins but he‚Äôs not as good as him."
"That‚Äôs seems a bit unfair. It‚Äôs not like the kings are a bottom feeder like the cavs. They‚Äôve generally finished fairly close to the play-in and were the 9 seed a few years back.  Ben has him beat in defence but playmaking id probably go fox. Ben is a great passer but he‚Äôs no scoring threat and doesn‚Äôt space the floor at all which are both large parts of playmaking. Fox does those and is an extremely good passer in his own right. And assist wise he has way less assist opportunities via team mates than Ben does.   And the scoring gap is substantial. Very close efficiency but fox has a way deeper bag and averaged a whole ten extra points? That‚Äôs comparable to the gap between MPJ and Damian Lillard, or Andrew wiggins and Bradley Beal"
"Not saying LeBron didn't desire new challenges but tbh with LeBron it always seemed like once a franchise was no longer useful to him in terms of being a contender and winning titles he jumped ship. Left the Cavs the first time because they couldn't attract top flight free agents or make enough moves to put them over the top so he went to Miami. In 2014 after the Spurs drubbed the Heat in the Finals LeBron saw the writing on the wall with Wade's star fading due to injuries and their cap situation not getting better. So now that the Cavs have Kyrie and the number one pick in Andrew Wiggins (who they traded to get Kevin Love) he goes back to Cleveland and delivers a legendary title. By 2018 with Kyrie gone and once again the cap situation blowing up he goes to LA where they have a plethora of young tradeable talent (which he got AD with) and a situation where he will never have trouble attracting free agents or convincing players to join the most popular NBA franchise ever in one of the most desirable locations to play in.   For Shaq it was definitely about proving critics wrong. He went to LA because the Magic lowballed him and the people of Orlando said he didn't deserve all that money. He wanted a trade out of LA because they chose Kobe over him. Then it felt like he also hopped onto potential title contenders like the Suns, Cavs, and Celtics to end his career."
"Ah, the Andrew Wiggins of years past"
"Magic Johnson got nicknamed ""Tragic"" after a bad playoff run in the early 80's.  Markelle Fultz got nicknamed ""MH370"" because his game disappeared and no one knew why.  The Brooklyn Nets called the Brooklyn Nuts after we got Kyrie.  Kristaps Porzingis, ""The Trebuchet"" because he's 100-feet tall and launches slow shots from a mile away.  Zion Williamson ""Snorlax.""  Kawhi Leonard was ""Wi-Fi"" because he was amazing but he would cut out on you whenever he felt like it.  Someone called Lamelo Ball ""LMAO Ball"" when he looked like he might bust but Lamelo escaped that fate.  The Lakers were the Los Angeles Flakers after the 2004 loss.  Andrew Wiggins was ""Adrian"" because despite being 6'8"" with a 44"" vertical his most famous Youtube clip was a prankster asking him if he was Asian and he thought the guy said Adrian."
"I think that's easy to say, but people probably wouldn't even realize Gobert was any good if you swap him and KAT whereas that would immediately turn the Jazz into the best offensive team in the history of basketball.    Not even Steph is capable of making the playoffs with Andrew Wiggins as the second-best player, and Wiggins is awesome now.  I get people want to see some wins before they give him credit, but that roster has been hot garbage most of the time he's been there.   It really has."
"Ahh yes, Andrew ‚Äúworst contract in the NBA‚Äù Wiggins and random role players is definitely the recipe to success. Shame on kat for holding them back. The 2012 Timberwolves roster (klove averaged 26/13) makes the 18-21 roster look like a g league team lmao."
"He needs a sports psychologist and to get some ""Yes"" people away from him.  If we get him gone and someone like Buddy Hield, CJ McCollum, Andrew Wiggins, or D'Lo I'll be ecstatic."
"I mean the Sixers/OKC strategy of tanking is a pretty recent phenomenon, but players like Jahlil Okafor or Andrew Wiggins never lived up to their immense hype, potentially because they played on bad teams.   But I don't really understand your point. Every draft like 70% of the lottery turns out to be average or disappointing for various different reasons. How am I supposed to name every player who became a bust because they were on trash teams when I don't know the specifics of each situation? I think its incumbent on YOU to provide a convincing list of recent, hyped players who emerged from tanking teams as number one guys."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."

However I‚Äôm sure he is going to be a stud, Browns proven me wrong so many times that now I assume he will turn into the best player of all time just because I didn‚Äôt think he had All-Star potential 3 years ago."
Andrew Wiggins played?!
"Ant is literally the player the Timberwolves have been looking for their entire franchise history. Team has had good big men- KG, Kevin Love, KAT- but never that star perimeter player you sort of need to truly compete for championships in today's NBA.  Thought we had him finally when we got Jimmy Butler (oops). Thought Andrew Wiggins could turn into that player (ouch). Now it looks like we *finally* got a real one."

"There‚Äôs lots of parlance about ‚Äúmax‚Äù because of how it scales for different players. Ayton isn‚Äôt eligible for the Luka or Trae Young level max, and was negotiating for the Andrew Wiggins style max. By failing to come to agreement he‚Äôs likely to have to find a max offer in restricted free agency, which yet again will come with lower %s of raise increases allowed over the deal in addition to 1 less year on it.   If Ayton wants to avoid that scenario, he can either take the qualifying offer for a 1 year deal and be fully unrestricted (I think his qualifying offer is just short of 20 million), or he can make sure he negotiates for a player option in whichever contract he signs before forcing the Suns to decide whether to match. Notably the 2+1 structure on restricted free agents has shown success in making teams pass on matching to retain players. Restricted free agents have veto power during their first year of matched by their original team, so by the time the Suns would be able to unilaterally trade Ayton again he‚Äôd be approaching free agency at the end of the season or opting into a subsequent 1 year/35M+."
The league should convince Andrew Wiggins that every quarter is the 4th quarter and that his team is always down by just a few points. 4th quarter Wiggins clawing is way back to get a lead is always a gem to witness.
Someone told me 538‚Äôs rapid metric says Cedi Osman and Andrew Wiggins should be paid the same‚Ä¶..  So yeah. Probably don‚Äôt trust it.

It's not at all but everyone who doesn't watch the sixers think he should be traded for Andrew Wiggins and his value is dropping minute by minute.
"Perfect example of two things.  1) Superstars in the NBA are so hard to trade. Draft picks aren't nearly as valuable as the NFL. AD got traded for the rights to .... DeAndre Hunter. LOL.  2) The Pelicans rank up there with the Kings and Wolves as the worst run franchises in the entire league. I'll even go a step further and say they are the worst. They lost AD due to horrible mismanagement and will do the same with Zion. At least with the Kings and Wolves they can say ""we lost Andrew Wiggins and De'Aaron Fox."" Players nowhere near the level of AD and Zion."

"Bro, Morey wanted James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, the 7th and 14th pick from the last draft and 2 future first rounds picks from the Warriors. There‚Äôs no damn way Morey hasn‚Äôt been offered a decent trade yet, he‚Äôs just expecting way too much from a trade for Ben. And just leaving Ben on the books while he creates more stink everyday is doing nothing but harm. Morey making constant mistakes during this entire thing."
"I have to think that some people are obsessed with talent, but fail to realize that he just doesn't have the mental make up to ever reach his full potential, aka Andrew Wiggins syndrome.    He's been in the league for what 5 years now?  He still hasn't worked on improving his game enough to at least attempt jump shots?    Morey my not want to trade him for someone like McCollum, but I think CJ is the best player he can possibly get for Simmons."
"Allen Iverson - an all time great but he's waaaay overhyped  Kyrie Irving - his fans talk about him like a top ten guard ever, he's really really not  Andrew Wiggins - was supposed to be the next Lebron, instead became Wigs   Ben Simmons - lol  Jahlil Okafor - LOL"
...That's like saying Andrew Wiggins is a better fit for the Warriors than LeBron because he wouldn't fit their motion offense.
Ya I mean Timberwolves fans being knowledgeable on Andrew Wiggins? Impossible!!
Lol Steph‚Äôs team was better than what Westbrook had in OKC for years but okay. Russ‚Äôs 2nd best teammate was literally Steven Adams the last couple years. Steph still has Draymond and Andrew Wiggins. FOH
Honestly DA gives me some Andrew Wiggins as a center vibes.
"I mean it is a pretty clear explanation for the contracts of players like Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter Jr, etc. Even guys like Murray who look worth it now, it was not nearly seen so at the time of his deal.  But the mentality is that if a player on a rookie deal is even/only close to a star, everyone expects them to want a max deal."
"2011 Game 1 Starting 5: Monta Ellis, Steph Curry, Dorrell Wright, David Lee, Andris Biedrins   2021 Game 1 Starting 5: Steph Curry, Jordan Poole, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, Kevon Looney   This would actually be a really fun game.  2011/2012 Steph Curry was one year away from breaking out and becoming All Star caliber.  Monta Ellis and Jordan Poole are both high octane offensive guards with questionable defense.  Dorell Wright was a decent 3 and D wing that would match up well with Wiggins.  David Lee and Draymond Green are opposites in that David Lee was a fantastic offensive player with questionable D as opposed to Draymond's elite D and questionable offense.  Biendrins and Looney are both decent defensive players that don't add a whole lot offensively.   I will rock with this years team because it has the far superior version of Steph.  Wiggins is a better player than Wright was, though Wright was a better shooter and would far better now than he did then I think.  A lot of 2011 Warriors offense came from Ellis and Lee who were not 3 point shooters, so it would be interesting to see if they could score enough points to keep up."
"""Andrew Wiggins 2.0"""
andrew wiggins cannot dribble
"Hes basically the Andrew Wiggins 2.0 IMO.   Not as jump out the gym athletic and probably won't land a max deal. That could change, he's 21 - hasn't missed a game yet in his career and had a pretty marked improvement in efficiency from year 1 to 2.  He could take a pretty big leap year 3.  He went from a 32% 3pt shooter to 40% on more volume. This could also be due to thibs too. Too early to tell."
"fr we sleeping on a guy who had a 53% TS last yr even though he's supposed to be ""efficient""üî•üî•üî•. Knicks really drafted a worse andrew wigginsüòπüòπ"
"I know you can, because that's what you're doing...  Maybe watch Warriors games before blindly spouting stats without context and acting as if it's gospel.  Wiggins didn't pass the ball that much, but he would score on good efficiency when he got it. Oubre ALSO didn't pass the ball much, if at all, so idk where you got this ""willing passer"" nonsense from with him. The difference between the two is that Oubre's passing issues were magnified by his godawful scoring efficiency.  It's also funny how you mention Oubre \*only\* getting 39 touches in 33 minutes, when it's just .15 touches per minute less than Wiggins. Wow. Big difference there. Oubre also had just 3 more assists compared to turnovers last year. His passing ability is legitimately awful. Obviously assist/turnover ratios aren't the be all end all for passing ability, but it's another nail in Oubre's passing coffin.  If Oubre DIDN'T primarily play off ball last season, I'd probably renounce the Warriors lmfao. And no, there were plenty of times Oubre had an opportunity to make a pass due to his athletic cutting ability drawing defensive attention, yet he would still instead throw up an awful, hopeless shot attempt over 3 defenders. He literally shot 44% on layups. For reference, Andrew Wiggins, your supposed black hole, shot 59% on layups.  Idk what your point is when it comes to Wiggins and Oubre's responsibilities compared to players like Bjelica, JTA, etc. Even just comparing the two, with similar responsibilities and skillsets, Wiggins was clearly better at scoring, passing, shooting, etc. But I don't understand how you can say they have ""easier decision making"" compared to actual good passers as an excuse for Oubre as to why he seems to overcomplicate plays. He gets the ball, he drives into the paint, then he passes to the open man. It's not hard. Why, then, is he not doing that? Because he's an unwilling passer with an awful basketball IQ. Literally that simple.  I know this reads as an Oubre hate piece, but I do like the guy. He was mature and professional in his time here, despite not being able to get out of his shooting slump. I'm glad he got a good contract with the Hornets and they look like an extremely fun team that I'll support heavily, especially since I was rooting for them last year too. I don't hate Oubre, his weaknesses as a player were just too apparent in our system while his strengths overlapped with Wiggins'."
yeah it's a real good sign when Andrew Wiggins is your worst passing rotation player (Wiseman's return nonwithstanding)
at least andrew wiggins doesnt need to get 25pts.
Andrew Wiggins just had one of the most impressive possessions possible.
"Catching this game late, is Andrew Wiggins hurt?"
not sure there's a player in the league i love watching fuck up more than andrew wiggins. YES I AM PETTY
Has there ever been a time in NBA history where a player was extended after the 3rd year for the max or big money and it backfired AND that it would have been prevented by waiting until the 4th year? Like Brandon Roy or Andrew Wiggins? I think in those cases though they may have gotten the same money anyways..
All this to beat Andrew Wiggins? ü§£
Their best possible trade might be Ben Simmons for Andrew Wiggins straight up but I‚Äôm not sure the warriors want him that badly. He‚Äôs not really a great fit with Draymond or Weismann on the court.
The Suns are absolutely right to wait and see. No need to give him the extension now. You can pay him his max later if it comes to that. You risk an Andrew Wiggins level contract by rushing this. He hasn‚Äôt shown the consistency to warrant a long term max.
"Turns out it‚Äôs hard to go above .500 when your best teammate was Andrew Wiggins. And he was all nba 3rd team in 2018. If we stay healthy this year, this team won‚Äôt be bad."
Not really. He was the number one pick. Those guys often get drafted to bad teams and have the offense built around them. Even if they are not efficient or consistent. They have leverage from day one to dictate their own touches through expectation.  See Andrew Wiggins and Boogie Cousins.
Out of those three I can‚Äôt believe I like Andrew Wiggins more than the other 2 now‚Ä¶
"LeBron fans saw him not talking about the vaccine, not revealing whether he got it and went ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal?  None of our business!‚Äù  They heard him say he‚Äôd ‚Äúdone his own research‚Äù and praised him for doing so  They heard him skirt recommending the vaccine and thought it meant nothing  They saw him publicly support Andrew Wiggins in a way that drew a pat on the back from Ted Cruz, turned a blind eye   He‚Äôs generally a great guy, but can you imagine thinking that this situation is just a matter of, like, salty Kobe stans going ‚ÄúI hate anything Lebron!‚Äù"
Back and forth between Ben and Kyrie with a sprinkle of Andrew Wiggins.
"&gt;Exactly it's not that these players are getting overpaid it's that the best players of the league get way underpaid because their actual value is astronomical.  I actually think it's both.  Obviously guys like Steph and LeBron are WAY underpaid. But the number of guys with Messi-like value is TINY.   And my guess is that someone like Klay (healthy) is probably pretty close to properly valued.   But Tobias Harris, Andrew Wiggins, Kristaps, CJ McCollum etc are overpaid. The Mavs overpaid Harrison Barnes when they signed him from the Warriors. And you look at those guys, and, generally, their contact is set by (or relative to) the max.   One point of reference might be shoe deals. There are three players with shoe deals worth over $20m annually: LeBron, KD, and Steph. (Steph was over $30m, but I saw something that suggests it's only $20m now.) Nobody else is over $15m."
Andrew Wiggins
"If it's RFA sure but people getting higher levels of angry at not throwing Ayton a 5 year Max when he hasn't shown major improvement in several areas don't make as much sense to me since it'll basically lock up Phoenix's cap for the next several years. Think Andrew Wiggins or Ben Simmons' extension, signing with the promise of getting better to eventually make the max money worth before they actually get better is a huge gamble, which is why I'm assuming they didn't give it to him yet (and Sarver is cheap with paying big men apparently) because he has to ""earn"" or ""prove"" he's max-worthy this season.   Personally I want to see more aggressive scoring, getting to the line more, some improvement defensively, and enter the top 5 center discussion."
"Very easily, could be a similar situation to Andrew Wiggins. Most teams don't want trade for a rim running big getting paid 35mil a year,"
"I‚Äôm just here to say that Andrew Wiggins is just as much of an anti-vaxxer as these guys, but he got jabbed and has no qualms about it today"
its because of Andrew Wiggins isn't it?
"When on Andrew Wiggins was the most hated man on r/nba , even more than usual for his standards"
"I‚Äôm not holding anything against anyone‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just pointing out that a lot of players not worthy of a max put up big numbers on bad teams. See, for example, Andrew wiggins."
"Why do you need to sign him now?  You can see one more season of him and sign him then if he deserves the max. It's prob your team's mistake of biting the max for Andrew Wiggins.  People bring up the Hayward situation but the Boston situation was objectively better (since no-one knew what Mitchell would become) and that's pretty rare in general.  If it works out, Ayton is still prob getting max or near max money. They just now have more flexibility next offseason."
Not the easiest article to read. It‚Äôs basically a summary of the ‚Äúworst‚Äù contracts in the NBA. There def needs to be a market correction for some of these players. Andrew Wiggins making 30 M/yr. You‚Äôd better be at least borderline all star if you‚Äôre making anything over ~25M/yr.
Wasn't this before the cap spike where many players were being given insane contracts well over their worth. Kawhi wasn't seen as the player as he is now because he was still on a very good spurs team where the system was viewed as highly as having star power. It wasn't really seen as crazy for not giving Kawhi a max at the time and spurs players were known for taking pay cuts for years. Andrew Wiggins and many others got overpaid after the tv deal and cap jump.
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"The issue is this is less about Ayton and more about having a championship team.  When you're capped out and not likely to get below the cap anytime soon, *it's to your advantage to hand out big contracts*. Operating over the cap, you want to balloon your salary as much as possible because it gives you more salary flexibility to operate in the trade market, even if you don't keep Ayton.   A good example of this was the Warriors traded Durant for DeAngelo Russell. It was an overpay for Russell too, but they didn't want to lose Durant's ""salary slot"". They wouldn't be under the cap anytime soon with Curry/Klay and Green's (then upcoming) extension, so losing Durant for nothing would have just shrinked their salary pool for no benefit.  Who cares what Russell's ""fit"" was (the Warriors sure didn't), they just wanted the asset, even overpaid. Later they flipped it for another overpaid player (Wiggins) and still aren't remotely bothered by that fact either. At some future point, maybe with Ben Simmons, they'll probably try to convert that $30 million salary slot into a big-time player.  As long as Ayton doesn't become a negative asset (which seems unlikely barring injury), being overpaid, even by a decent margin, isn't a barrier. Like Andrew Wiggins, DeAngelo Russell, and others, he's movable, and the big salary slot he inhabits is a huge advantage for any over the cap team *that is willing to spend money*.  That's the issue here. There isn't a compelling basketball/franchise planning reason to not max Ayton, in fact, quite the opposite. The only reason to not max Ayton is 1) you think he's going to fall off a cliff production-wise and become Andrea Bargnani or 2) you're cheap.  Most everyone suspects Sarver is being cheap. Hence..."
Andrew Wiggins gets the FMVP tho
"Andrew Wiggins, and James Wiseman are backing then up now, I'm not too worried about it."
Their supporting cast is similar imo. Andrew Wiggins is a lot better than Harrison Barnes was
"Exactly, the Suns are seemingly failing to understand how the market goes for young players coming off their rookie scale with all star potential or who are already playing at an all star level. They get the rookie max. That‚Äôs just how it goes, because if you let that player hit free agency there‚Äôs always going to be a team like the Hornets, Kings, Grizzlies, or Denver (Teams who never get free agents of that caliber) who will gladly splurge to get that kind of player.   Whether or not that player is worth or lives up to their contract is a different story (see: Andrew Wiggins), but the market for these players is essentially ‚Äúpay them big, gamble on whether or not they live up to that contract‚Äù."
"Andrew Wiggins GSW guide to success  Step 1: Phone in regular season; try just hard enough on defense to get accolades from pundits  Step 2: Make playoffs with Klay, Steph, and Draymond healthy  Step 3: Harrison Barnes your way to a few open corner 3s per game.   Step 4: Team wins championship. Profit"
"Max deal is a bad idea in most cases, see Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins.   I also believe NBA is going to re-negotiate with players in the upcoming contract on this, thus many team won't offer that option."
"&gt;  Also, is Wiggins much, much better than Andrew Wiggins  Honestly, i'd say it's a wash"
"Don‚Äôt need Lonnie to be lock-down.  Just need him to be above-average, IMO.  Michael-Carter Williams isnt ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù, but he is a very, very good defender now.  Andrew Wiggins went from apathetic to a plus defender.  Middleton was not a good defender coming into the league.  Lavine has come a long way.  I agree with your assessment on Lonnie.  Defense is something he should be able to pick up over time.  His lack of confidence, ability to finish/take contact, and consistently are still concerns.  Guy just disappears every other game."
Name a single playoff team who has a worse second best player than Andrew Wiggins or Russell lmao. Not to mention Russell was in and out of lineups and didn‚Äôt Curry only play like 5 games?
"I haven't been following the Wiggins situation - is GSW desperately trying to get Wiggins to play following a tense public blowout between Wiggins and the team and specifically the coaching staff in part over public comments made by the coach about Wiggins' fitness to play? Also, is Wiggins much, much better than Andrew Wiggins, in a way that actually affects the team's title chances, instead of a third stringer/nice option who's clearly had to learn where he sits in the team hierarchy?  If so, yes."
"this is the season where  1) curry was out for a majority 2) 4/5 of their team left that FA 3) every other team kicked the shit out of them because the warriors were doing it to them  4) his best teammate was DeAngelo Russell, and his second best was Andrew Wiggins"
"My bad. If I had a dollar for every time a joke went over my head, I'd make Andrew Wiggins money."
"Andrew Wiggins, who‚Äôs just really a taller skinnier Avery Jackson"
"If only same stats meant same progression,Andrew Wiggins would be a top 10 player."
"The issue with Tobias isn't that he's not a solid third option. It's that he's a solid third option that's paid like the first option. It's the Andrew Wiggins conundrum.  Not saying that Simmons is not also overpaid, but he actually makes less than Harris."

The Hunchback of Andrew Wiggins
?? Andrew Wiggins is a great player so I have no idea what you‚Äôre on.
"If your team is so poorly constructed that you think you'll lose because Andrew Wiggins isn't playing, there are bigger problems with your team."
"I posted this a thousand times, but there just wasn't a move out there that made sense. At any point. The uniqueness of our situation with salary, Draymond green being hard to build around, and Andrew Wiggins being a negative for every team except us made every move that was suggested seem kind of bone headed."
"Andrew Wiggins. Averaging 22/5/2/1/1 on 55/42/68 in his last ten games, with elite defense."
"Yeah but even the eye test takes like 5 games, unless you're Draymond or gobert or something.  Andrew Wiggins was a great example. Took me like half a year before I realized his contests were actually bothering shooters. His defense is apparently miles better than it was in Minnesota, but visually the difference is subtle"
I think Andrew Wiggins can't keep it going more often because he needs more confidence.
"Read Andrew Wiggins, look at highlight, ok that doesn't look like wiggins, wait why are the jerseys white? Hold up GSW isn't playing tonight."
Andrew Wiggins at home

Andrew Wiggins.
And the Rockets faced rookie Donovan Mitchell and Andrew Wiggins
"Come on now‚Ä¶Ya‚Äôll GSW fans gas the fuck outta your roster until it comes to the MVP convo then they‚Äôre all scrubs?  Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Jordan Poole is a million times better than Will Barton, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon, Jeff Green.  I don‚Äôt know if what Jokic is doing in Denver w/o MPJ and Murray is sustainable, but if it is and they make the playoffs, that‚Äôs the MVP."
Yep. I bet if Andrew Wiggins was retired he wouldn't be vaxxed right now. Maybe Stockton would have gotten it in order to play.

"Luka is on his roster as a G/F so if he can count as a F I would put him, otherwise I think I would put Andrew Wiggins beleive it or not, part of the best team in the league while averaging 19 and 4 on 37.5% shooting from deep, gotta give this GSW team some more recognition than just 1 player. Would say Draymond but his ppg is pretty low even though his assists r good"
Andrew Wiggins
"Otto Porter, Andrew Wiggins, Curry, Poole, Draymond not the best year of his career but his best year since KD played in GSW, not sustainable and Poole/Porter/Wiggins/Porter have zero playoff success and are very unproven"
"‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins levitates up in the air for the offensive rebound‚Äù. There, I fixed it."
Andrew Wiggins has bird bones.
"Andrew ""Marvin Bagley"" Wiggins"
Miles Bridges - 20/7/3 getting paid 5 million.   Andrew Wiggins - 19/4/2 getting paid 31 million.  Not really fair since Miles is on his rookie contract and should get a huge bag this off season.
Andrew Wiggins has consistently scored between 17-21 points his entire career. He's always good for 17 a night
"&gt;Also at the end of the day it seems the recurring theme with Butler is money lol.  Yes, superstars like to be paid more than Andrew Wiggins and be on teams playing good basketball.  Only a salty Timberwolves fan would think to twist that as a bad thing about Jimmy, I swear."
"&gt;Andrew Wiggins on Otto Porter Jr: ""I call him Lionel Richie sometimes. He just be looking like him for no reason"""
"Andrew Wiggins on Otto Porter Jr: ""I call him Wilt Chamberlain sometimes. He just be looking like him for no reason"""
"It‚Äôs a reach that current year dray is a top 20 player, but even given that argument, a top 5 player, a top 20 player, Andrew Wiggins and the rest of your roster being G leaguers a year ago I can guarantee nobody would say they would be 17-2 and favorites to come out of the West."
You do know that Steph Curry existed in a Warriors uniform way before Kerr came in as coach?  People acting like Steph was an established superstar even before Kerr got on.  People also ignoring the fact that the current Warriors offense (for people who actually analyze their system and plays) are clearly a product of Kerr as it draws inspiration from Phil and Pop's systems.  Kerr took the best out of the systems he played for and it worked wonders.  If you objectively look at what Kerr has done for the Warriors you would know that he didn't just ride off of Curry/KD's coattails.  Wanna know the real reason why GS was a dynasty and can become one again? The FO.  Warriors drafted and developed their big 3. They turned Andrew Wiggins into an all star level player. They found guys like JTA and GP2. They revived careers of guys like Livingston. They even turned memes like Mcgee into a championship contributing player.  Every current and ex gs player only have great things to say about the organization. Which is why they'll probably be able to find success even after Curry/Klay/Dray retires.
"I say this every time it gets brought up. We didn‚Äôt trade a golden state warriors Andrew Wiggins away, we traded a Timberwolves Wiggins away. He was never going to be that player for us and he probably would‚Äôve killed Ant‚Äôs ability by staying. Every Timberwolves fan would do the deal again in a heartbeat. If we had Steph and Draymond would we have done that deal? No, because then Wiggins would be playing how he is now. But we‚Äôll never have Steph and Dray."
"Andrew ""efficient 25"" Wiggins"
"Lakers front office might, Warriors front office won't. They're trying to build for win-now-and-in-the-future-as-well and 37-year-old LeBron is *not* a future piece.  26-year-old Andrew Wiggins and 20-year-old James Wiseman are."
He can be a good third option on a good team like Andrew wiggins on the warriors
Andrew Wiggins: Allstar
"ILY ANDREW WIGGINS, hit that 3 in the last 2 seconds and covered the -13.5 spread"
I love Iggins Wiggins of Andrew
Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins looking like a REALLY GOOD 3RD OPTION üëÄüëÄ
Never thought I‚Äôd say this but I love Andrew Wiggins.
It‚Äôs the Andrew Wiggins show
It should be illegal to suggest an Anthony Davis trade can happen with Andrew Wiggins as the centerpiece
Andrew Wiggins has been an absolute *dawg* recently. Dude is driving like he's Jimmy Butler. Nobody else on the team can draw fouls like he does.
"""better prospect""  hes over a year and a half from being draft eligible lmao a lot can change between then and now (like it did with andrew wiggins)"
Andrew Wiggins would like to have a pleasant word with you. P4P best smile in the league by far. You can‚Äôt help but cheese up when you see Wiggins smile
"andrew wiggins absolutely was a generational prospect coming out of high school (not college), a year before he was drafted"
"andrew wiggins was seen as ""generational"" a year before he got drafted too"
His name is Andrew Wiggins.
Bro Andrew Wiggins is only 26! I somehow thought this man was like 32.
Andrew Wiggins about to feast!
"&gt;One of the players everyone thought was a million times better then Andrew Wiggins  Is what you said and that was the case. RoCo was way better.  I actually loved the Wiggins trade for your team, because as low as I was on Wiggins, he was traded for a player that I was even lower on, but that's a whole other conversation"
One of the players everyone thought was a million times better then Andrew Wiggins.
Jordan Poole and Andrew Wiggins obviously.
"&gt;With tonight's victory over the 76ers, the Warriors are now 16-2. Andrew Wiggins is on a team whose record is 14 games above .500 for the first time ever in his 7-year career  Daaamm dawg"
"&gt;They maxed wiggins, who was playing like shit, over Butler, who brought them to the playoffs.  Don't spout shit when you think you know shit and are just blatantly wrong.   [They traded for Jimmy in June of 2017.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2646262-jimmy-butler-traded-to-timberwolves-for-zach-lavine-kris-dunn-no-7-pick.amp.html)  [They agreed to max Wiggins in October of 2017.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2722896-andrew-wiggins-timberwolves-agree-to-5-year-148-million-contract-extension.amp.html)  [They offered Butler the max the next summer of 2018.

Look at the timeline. Wolves maxed Wiggins Oct. 11, 2017 and the season started October 17. Jimmy hadn't even played a SINGLE minute in a Wolves uniform when they maxed Wiggins, guy.  Get your facts straight."
"JTA yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Andrew Wiggins gave a look of pleasant surprise. Draymond Green belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Stephen Curry hit the locker room door, injured Warriors star Klay Thompson hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
All-Star Andrew Wiggins!
Andrew Wiggins literally never.
"I think it‚Äôs pretty clear now that something is up between Tatum and Brown.  I honestly don‚Äôt know who to keep but one of them has to go.  Brown has a lower ceiling but a high floor, Tatum could and should be a top 5 guy but is so goddamn inconsistent and makes boneheaded mistakes, plus the selfishness.  He‚Äôs really starting to remind me of Andrew Wiggins with the Wolves, yeah he‚Äôs getting 20 PPG but his efficiency is horrendous."
The COVID vaccine made Andrew Wiggins enjoy basketball again. Incredible

"Kinda a weird post to make considering Canadian basketball has really been taking off in the past 5-10 years. RJ Barrett, SGA, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins with some other talented Canadians that didn't quite pan out"
"I think for the past 2 offseasons, it's *not* Pelinka. His offseason moves were pretty much widely-praised in the moment. Last season people were actually saying stuff like ""Lakers actually won the title and came the back the next season with an even better team"". Maybe those players weren't maximized in LA but they are pretty productive elsewhere this season (except Gasol).  This offseason he's been a bit shackled by his stars wanting to play with Russ and the owners not wanting to pay too much tax. If the Lakers had the Warriors roster, the Buss' would've probably already traded away Andrew Wiggins for tax relief. Stuff like that make a difference."
If Andrew Wiggins is considered a bust cade bustingham is too
Who is better Harrison Barnes or Andrew Wiggins?
"KOC on the Mismatch pod mentioned something pretty crazy last ep.  Andrew Wiggins is on track to score 20,000points in his career, and will probably be the only player to score 20k and not make the hall of fame."
Andrew Wiggins +30 üò≠
"Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole scored 30 each on crazy efficiency last game. It‚Äôs not as 2 dimensional as Steph and Dray. Like you said, an NBA team is more than just two people and the Warriors have the deepest roster by far. Everything you‚Äôve said rings hollow when the Suns have been stuck in mediocrity for years and they had one good run last year and they squandered it. If they had won, this conversation would be different."
Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins with the FMVP
imagine if they went 73-9 again and actually won the title this time after going down 3-1 in the finals with an Andrew Wiggins buzzer beater in game 7
I can't wait till Andrew Wiggins wins 2022 FMVP
Andrew Wiggins is a system player as we can see right now playing for the Golden State Warriors. He was not a bust during his time with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The system Twolves' have was not a fit for his game. I remember a bust named Anthony Bennett tho.
I think to be legitimly concerned about the fact Andrew Wiggins is playing like an All-Star and his contract is not an overpay. Top 3 best SF in the NBA and not 2.
"In preseasaon, during the vax problem moment Zach Lowe and / or his podcast guest said that the Warriors were anxious of losing him because whatever you can say about him, his contract and his draft pick, he is a good or at least good/average NBA player who plays 34m a night and doesn't miss games. And that is not easy to replace.   I'm not sure he's ever been considered as a ""bust"", just a (mentally) overrated prospect who was drafted too high.   Now that he found a better role ‚Äì with no superstar mindset needed ‚Äì and improved a lot as a defender, he'll have a better image and could still get another solid contract (not max of course).   But again, if Michael Olowokandi, Anthony Bennett or Kwame Brown are some ""busts"" at #1 overall picks, you had to find another word for Andrew Wiggins, even before he was traded to Golden State."
"I hate to link the NYpost, [but this is how people were talking about Wiggins pre draft.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2013/11/02/andrew-wiggins-dealing-with-lebron-type-hype/amp/)   I never heard people talking about Zion like he was going to be a top 5 player all time.  &gt;	CBS analyst Doug Gottlieb sees Wiggins as a cross between James, Kevin Durant and Tracy McGrady, with Wiggins‚Äô athleticism unlike anything Gottlieb has seen since Kevin Garnett came out of high school in 1995.  Again, it‚Äôs Doug Gottlieb, but that wasn‚Äôt a crazy opinion back then."
if andrew wiggins is an all star this year ill eat a building
"&gt; he can grab 30 points on any given night  There are a few dozen people in the NBA that can say ""Fuck it, I'm gonna put up 30 tonight"" and go out there and actually do it.  Andrew Wiggins is not one of them."
"Wow. If you told me Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole would go for 30 pts each on the same night ON THE SAME TEAM, I would never believe you"
"LeBron is just a bitter old man. He only won 4 championships and he‚Äôs not going to match MJ any more because he made a foolish trade for Westbrook. To top it off, he has to go watch Stephen Curry out there having fun and winning with Andrew Wiggins, who he personally traded to the Timberwolves for Kevin Love, who was a massive bust in his time with the Cavs and who didn‚Äôt help him beat the aforementioned Stephen Curry who was out there having fun and winning with Klay Thompson, who the Warriors passed up trading for the aforementioned Kevin Love."
Can we call Andrew Wiggins Ender yet? Or does he have to genocide a few teams in the playoffs first?

I think they‚Äôll get better, we played the best team in the league so it was obviously going to be frustrating.  Shoutout Jordan Poole and Andrew Wiggins, crazy game from both of them, becoming more and more apparent Poole could be an amazing piece for the warriors going forward, and dare I say it, Warriors truly unlock Wiggins potential and with them he has become such a valuable 2 way player.

"i‚Äôd honestly say andrew wiggins is our most consistent player. He will rarely be that prime MJ guy (maybe 1-2 times a season), but most of the time he‚Äôll give you 17 points and leave it at that, he doesn‚Äôt really have all that many bad games"
"Nah, I‚Äôve watched him since day one. He has cold stretches but I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs inconsistent. He isn‚Äôt like Terrence Ross or Jeff Green or Andrew Wiggins who look like prime MJ one day and then look like a fan stumbled out on the court the next."

Andrew ‚ÄúThe Clamp‚Äù Wiggins
He definitely applied that pressure on Kawhi and had him chucking up shots. Wiggins also contested nearly every single shot of his with those long arms which makes things more difficult. I don't think it should be surprising that Andrew can play great on ball defence when he wants too.
"Andrew Wiggins Defensive play of the year, you heard it here first lol"

"Andrew Wiggins has been inconsistent his entire career. Every year he has a handful of fantastic games, but is bad in a lot of other games. He didn't get his massive contract because He sucked in every game. He got it because there were enough games that made Minnesota think he could be great. Maybe Steph and the Golden State culture will make him consistent, but I wouldn't count on it."

I love the effort from Andrew Wiggins! Still early days but he genuinely looks like a different player this season. I know Wolves fans have said this to themselves multiple times though so I will be patient and let it play out lol
Ah yes the super athlete that is Andrew Wiggins
"Yep, Andrew Wiggins also! Can't forget him."
My point was that people that only watched Covington whenever he played their team or in highlights only thought of him as the second coming of Dennis Rodman because he was a prominent piece on his team's defense.  His last full year in Philly he was guarding the top wing scorer a lot of time cause Ben wasn't Ben yet (defensively). Then he went to the Wolves and continued getting the top wing assignment because who else would? Andrew Wiggins or rookie Josh Okogie? Then the Rockets traded away a first in a confusing 4-way deal where he was the main piece they were getting back. And continued getting the top wing assignment because Harden definitely isn't the one to get it. Then the Blazers traded two firsts for him.  If you're an NBA fan that just hasn't watched enough Covington analysis you 100% think he's some defensive guru based on the fact that he always gets the top wing assignment wherever he ends up playing for and the fact that teams trade away picks for him every deadline without him being a good scorer
"It kind of makes sense for him to come off the bench. The line from our management is that it helps them control who he plays his minutes with and what game situations he plays during. Their big worry seems to be that he'll regress and try chucking or well... basically... that he'll become Andrew Wiggins.  I don't hate it. It ensures he spends a lot of time with Rubio, who's a really good teacher. It also helps him play as a focal point when DLo isn't trying to go supernova 100% of the time.  He could clearly be starting on our team, but do you really want him playing PF with most of his minutes? Because that's essentially what it'll end up being if we promote him to a starter."
"I think what pops out to me is the functional athleticism aspect.  Some athletic freaks move really stiff , like Dwight Howard in his younger days, or Andrew wiggins to an extent.  Idk what it is , probably coordination or something like that"
"Good points, I just quickly skimmed over the last two seasons of players hovering around 1-3 assists with 16-20 FGA a game and they were either shooters or big men like Klay, T.j. Warren, Aldridge, KP.  Edit: Lol and Andrew Wiggins"
"Yes, the only way to unlock your true potential is to love what you do. Look at a guy like Andrew Wiggins, all the talent in the world but just not that good because he just doesn't care all that much."
"Because one of them is injured, one of them is playing his eighth NBA game, and one of them was Andrew Wiggins."
Now cover the rest of Andrew Wiggins career.  This is just a ridiculous thread.  I don‚Äôt care at all what a player accomplishes for six minutes.
"Everyone's always like ""You gotta give them time..""  Name one case where anyone was mediocre, average, whatever, in year 1 and then ended up being a star.  For every 1 person who ended up even just good, there are 9 busts.  You know in the first five games of their career if they're Kobe Bryant, or if they're Andrew Wiggins.  Those guys are going 25/12/8 etc..  They're playing 40 minutes.  They aren't shooting 30%, playing 20 minutes, and putting out lines like 12 pts, 2 reb, 2 assists on 4 of 12 shooting."
Jimmy killed it in the playoffs and Siakam turned into Andrew Wiggins
Seriously. Langford can already slash and defend - that makes him useful. Andrew Wiggins can only do one of those things.   Even if Langford does nothing else he will stick around in this league if he can stay healthy. But kind of silly to presume he won‚Äôt develop at all - dude was considered a top 5 pick before an underwhelming year at school. The talent is there.

I didn't mention it because it's fairly obvious. Especially when the Owner chooses Andrew Wiggins over you
We were so close to a possibility of Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Edwards playing together. They could bond over not liking basketball and perhaps Edwards could teach Wiggins some (football) skills. Shame. Maybe in another life
"Obviously there were some possessions where they didn't manage to get 2 or 3 on him because the warriors will also try to stop the trap, but it was clear the game plan was to deny curry the ball before he even gets the ball and to deny him the ball the moment he gets the ball.  Once you're double teamed the only real way is to either get help or pass out of tthe double/triple and hope your teammate makes the shot because once the ball leaves your hand the defenders will key in on them too and the clippers have fast defenders.  There are literally clippers fans in the post game thread saying the exact same thing, and ty lue said at half time that was their strategy as well (bltz steph) so I don't see how this can even be debated.  The strategy would be less useful if Oubre could shoot more than 10% from 3 and GS's next best player was Paul George instead of Andrew Wiggins. But the Clippers know this and more power to them for capitalising."
Andrew Wiggins was fantastic. Dude played all world defense on kawhi and had a cross that he picked up with the same hand into a jumper that was Chris Paul-esque.
"And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Andrew Wiggins is NICE."
More like andrew Wiggins level defense.
No Dwight is part of a whole separate generation of players. He came in at the tail end of Shaq's prime.   The Dwight thing was understandable... it would be like if Andrew Wiggins decided to call himself Mamba as soon as he came in the leauge while Kobe was still playing.
let me ask andrew wiggins
Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker
For me Andrew Wiggins. I thought he would be an all time great.
So he can be like last year huh?  When he averaged lower points on worse efficiency than Andrew Wiggins?
Andrew wiggins+2021 min pick?
Slightly off topic but Curry jumped from shooting like 20% from 3 to 37%. He'll probably be back to around 42% by game 12 and stay there for the season. Also fucking Andrew Wiggins has been shooting 39% from 3 for the season.
Andrew Wiggins
omg Coby White straight looks like discount Andrew Wiggins.
"Don't worry, there will be a dozen new Andrew Wiggins threads every week."
"That's a complicated conversation as of late.  What would the offer have been in terms of picks? Cos rn the minny pick is a sensational asset, and the magic made the playoffs last year.  His positional fit is also worse than a wing, and did they even want DLo?  More importantly, and surprisingly--depending on how much of a wiggins hater one is--young andrew is playing winning basketball.  We'll see if he's consistent with it, but he's played hard defensively and made generally good decisions with the ball in his hands in almost all the games this year.  That's a really promising sign, actually.  His impact has been up and down, he still ghosts and he's not ""playing up to his contract"" as everyone on r/nba is so sensitive to. And he's obviously had to shake rust off like everyone else.  But we're actually totally happy with him.  Would gordon be better?  Maybe, but in what role, and what would that mean for dray, wiseman, and Paschall?    In a vacuum anyone would rather have gordon than wiggins, and I might even agree in this very reality.  But it's not that cut an dry.  Consistent play on the wing at wiggins' current level is of paramount importance, and totally worth the overpay, insofar as it gives us playoff ball come that time of year."
Andrew Wiggins is basically Lebron /s
Yep winning a championship with Andrew Wiggins as your second best player would make anyone the GOAT at their position
He has all-time great what-if Andrew Wiggins!
How about an Andrew Wiggins? Great value very athletic
"Most people grow up playing baseball in the summer here. And the Jays were wildly popular in the 90s with back to back World Series.

Thanks to Vince Carter‚Äôs popularity in the 2000‚Äôs and with the Raptors recent championship and 7 year run there‚Äôs way more to come.   Outside of our Lord and Saviour Steve Nash there‚Äôs:   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Chris Boucher, and  Kelly O to name a few.   We the north!"
I like your chances when the Warrior's second best player is now Andrew Wiggins.
"I believe LeBron last year as well no? He had the 4th highest salary in the league. About $800k away from tying #2. Curry had the highest.   It's weird though, basically because the *timing* and length of contracts often makes the difference between a 30% and a 38% cap hit negligible. If you sign up your guys 3-11 up for 3 year deals. And then you have full Bird Rights to your #1 and #2 guys. You can sign them at any amount you'd like up to the (designated) SuperMax.   Of course if you change the team, yes, the calculus has changed and now it becomes more difficult. But at the same time... not really because all trades have to match with 105% of the value.  So if you want to take on $30M in salary, you have to give up between 28 and 32 or so.   There's also a minimum spend which actually quite high. You cannot spend less than 90% of the cap.   If you HAD to spend 98M and the most you can give to your best player was around $30M, and in general most teams use about $12 M for 5 roster spots.   You now have 56 million dollars to spend on 6 players. You could go straight average across the board around $9.3M a pop. You could kind of bell curve it,   * 2 at $3.5M * 2 at $8.5M  * 2 at $16M  Most FO's try to go with either a 1B or #2 guy, and then do a step-down approach in terms of spending. That would mean losing the majority of that remaining money, or at least a sizable chunk.   But again, this is just the math around a MINIMUM spend.   When you get to maxing out dollars in order to compete especially for titles it's way different.   Harping on the Jazz for Gobert from this perspective seems ridiculous. Mitchell and Gobert account for 47% of the Jazz's Cap Room next years. What's an ideal percentage?  If they are your best players... that's a very good position. Compared to LeBron and Davis who take up 62% of the Cap.   The majority of Cap problems come from paying players who are really $5M players and quite easily swappable with another player and paying them $12M or even more than that.   Rarely do guys like Tobias Harris and Andrew Wiggins enter the mix. They are bad contracts the day they're signed."
Andrew wiggins  Edit:westbrook and any former okc players except one.
I mean we got Andrew Wiggins.   I still think the timberwolves fleeced us
andrew wiggins averages 17 on 39/37/71.....
"LeBron hasn't been the best player in the league since 2005 man come on. It was around 2010-2012 that he finally became the best in the league. Accolades absolutely display a player's accomplishments. They're flawed, but definitely contribute to a player's legacy in a big way. It's why you can look at hardens 2018 Vs beals 2020 and deem one season significantly better than the other(just one example that comes to mind, there are better examples out there of similar stat lines but the accolade is what gives the context of how the person's performance was perceived).  PG defense is less important because 1. You're never going to stop the best guards from scoring. Whether you put Kyrie or cp3 on curry he's giving you 30+ on similar efficiency. Additionally, if a guard shoots a contested 3 from 30 feet your defense doesn't really fall apart. That was still a bad shot and the defense doesn't adjust to deny that shot. However, if a center is feasting or even has a mismatch in the post the probability of that possession translating to a bucket is extremely high, so you have to change your scheme by sending a double team or subbing in a big man that's better suited to guarding the other teams center. Also, if you have a good defensive big man as an anchor your defense as a whole can focus more on the perimeter because the paint is locked down. One guy can lock down a crucial area of the court which translates to a good defensive team. Your example of bogut being an elite defender fits this perfectly.  8 points is the difference between Damian Lillard and Andrew Wiggins last season. Sure, assists are great and cp3s passing and vision is better than currys, but their seasons were incredibly different. Cp3 had a great season in that MVP level year but curry was other-worldly. Cp3 shot 50/36/87 in 09, which is fantastic, but Steph shot 50/45/90 on 4 more shot attempts, along with of course shooting from half court and shooting a ridiculous amount of full court heaves. Curry also did this in 4 minutes less than cp3, which is substantial over the course of a full season. Also, as much of a copout as it feels like to bring up intangibles, the playstyle of curry and cp3 is drastically different on offense. Curry played far more off ball than cp3 in their respective seasons and obviously drew a ton of double teams, so while he did average less assists than Chris, I assume the amount of open looks and easy baskets he generated(and still generates) outweigh the amount that cp3 generated. This point is admittedly down to opinion though, as there's nothing that measures this stat.  By the way, of course cp3s teammates have never been as good as curry had from 2017-2019, but let's not act like Blake, deandre Jordan, harden were bums. If anything, Currys ppg would lower, like they did, by playing next to more stars, and his assists would lower too due to playing off ball more. Cp3 was definitely playing with bums in New Orleans though."
put some respect on andrew wiggins name.
"If he took Kelly Oubre and Andrew Wiggins to a Finals and lost it would still be the greatest carry job in the history of the NBA.   If he won? Fuck LeBron, fuck MJ, Curry is the GOAT no questioned asked. The kind of miracle it would take to *win a ring* with this team would put Jesus Christ himself to shame. I would expect Curry to follow this up by curing fucking cancer."
"I like Andrew ""Kawhi-lite"" Wiggins"
god Andrew Wiggins are you good at anything
Yeah Fultz is currently in the Andrew Wiggins category. Disappointment? Sure. But not exactly a bust.
"So just trade him then.   Was Lonzo a ""wasted pick,"" or an asset that helped get AD?  Was Buddy Hield a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get DMC?  Was Andrew Wiggins a wasted pick, or an asset that got Kevin Love?  Was Eric Gordon a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get CP3?  Was Javaris Crittenton a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get Pau Gasol?"
Minnesota flair with Andrew Wiggins is a cry for help!
Andrew ‚ÄúSon Gohan‚Äù Wiggins
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html   Thats what im referencing. I hear you in that if you're in charge of personnel decisions, then the blame should fall on you for bad contracts. But the owner is the boss boss, head honcho, and all those articles at the time made it really seem like Taylor made the decision after Wiggins' promise. Who knows how much its real, but its a big part of why thibs doesn't get public blame for that imo"
Andrew Wiggins all the way
Luka doing his job as the second best player on the court. His teammates were completely lost and confused.  Porzingas has to do more. I suspect this is what you‚Äôll get from him in the future. A potential superstar tht never came ala Andrew Wiggins
Whoever gets the first pick isn‚Äôt trading it no matter what especially when there‚Äôs a consensus surefire number one pick in Cade who‚Äôs comparison is ‚ÄúLuka lite‚Äù and it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for the Thunder to trade SGA and a bunch of picks for Cade because Andrew Wiggins and you already have a star in SGA. It‚Äôs not worth the risk for the Thunder and it‚Äôs not worth the risk for whoever gets the number pick.
"Lol what is this ridiculous comment?  Steph got to the playoffs with his best offensive teammate being Andrew Wiggins. Once Wiseman went down the Warriors had no right making the playoffs  Yet here you are bragging about Harden elevating a roster made up of Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Joe Harris and generally a much stronger bench than what the Warriors are supporting Steph with  And some people think I'm too harsh when I say this subreddit has to have the lowest sports IQ of any subreddit on this site. This shit you said is just ignorant garbage"
Andrew ‚ÄúBruno Caboclo‚Äù Wiggins.
"PG: John Wall SG: Buddy Hield SF: Andrew Wiggins PF: Kevin Love C: Stephen Adams  Wall and Love are self explanatory.   Buddy has a long contract with a big dollar amount and so far has come up short of earning it. Sacramento has guys they will need to pay and will want to have space to add pieces as their young guys grow. With Hield underperforming, that will be tough.  Wiggins isn‚Äôt terrible and gives GS a lot on D. Still, he‚Äôs not a star and he uses a lot of cap space on a team trying to contend. Based on situation, he‚Äôs the worst. There‚Äôs an argument for Hayward based on his health track record over the past several seasons.   Adams is kind of similar. He‚Äôs a good, overpaid player whose long term contract with a lot owed will make it tough for the Pelicans to build around their young guys and win in the West. Horford is also a candidate, but his contract isn‚Äôt hurting the Thunder much."
"So you applied the context that the Bucks got better by getting Jrue in exchange for Bledsoe while ignoring that the Raptors lost Kawhi, Ibaka, and Marc Gasol within these last two years and played zero home games while in a different country? Jimmy Butler just got exposed and deserves to get slandered for playing worse than PG, Siakam, etc. Hell he played worse than Andrew Wiggins if we're being real."
&gt;he refused to wait and wanted it in the middle of the season **when it was essentially impossible to do.**  Because they maxed Andrew Wiggins
You're leaving out the part where the timberwolves offered him a contract extension significantly below the max because they already maxed Andrew Wiggins
"The overreaction on this sub during the playoffs is insane lol. Jimmy Butler just arguably had his best year of his career this season, no it doesn‚Äôt make sense to trade him for Andrew Wiggins."
"Jimmy ""Andrew Wiggins"" Butler"
"Jimmy ""Andrew Wiggins"" Butler"
He wanted to trade him for Ben Simmons after his second year because he thought he saw some ‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins in him‚Äù
He‚Äôs basically the guard version of Andrew Wiggins
No one can guard him lol   Except the GOAT Andrew Wiggins
I think ‚ÄúAndrew wiggins with an anger issue‚Äù is the most narratively satisfying clownery I‚Äôve seen
"Among those who accepted the camp invitations: Golden State‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins, New York‚Äôs RJ Barrett, Memphis‚Äô Dillon Brooks, Oklahoma City‚Äôs Luguentz Dort, Houston‚Äôs Kelly Olynyk, New Orleans‚Äô Nickeil Walker-Alexander, and Indiana‚Äôs Oshae Brissett.  For some, like Barrett and Brooks, availability will obviously hinge on how far their teams advance in the NBA playoffs.  ‚ÄúThere is no greater feeling in sports than the chance to represent your country on the highest international stage at the Olympic Games,‚Äù Canada senior men‚Äôs program general manager Rowan Barrett said. ‚ÄúOur players and staff fully recognize the unique opportunity that lies ahead of us and I would like to commend them for their dedication to playing for Canada this summer.‚Äù     Let's go"
"Can probably add Andrew Wiggins to that too. Career high shooting numbers. Could be the empty arenas, could be the system. Could be both!"
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
"I mean, you can get an extremely lite version of Gobert, but you're not going to plug in another rim protector and have nearly the same level of shot deterrence/disruption that you get from Gobert.   The Jazz had a top-5 defense this season while ranking last in Turnovers forced. That's *ridiculous,* and it illustrates how special the impact Rudy has is.  Saying Gobert's skillset is replaceable because players like Poeltl and Embiid exist is exactly like saying Simmons' skillset is replacable because other switchable players like Andrew Wiggins and Lu Dort exist who can do a bit of everything. It's true, but it's not the same."
RJ Barrett is just Andrew Wiggins but with shorter arms and way less hops. More focused/determined then Wiggins at his age tho.
"i was gonna say it depends on his contract but he's on a rookie max, so.  i know he's an all-star (albeit in the east) and a dpoy candidate, but i kind of wonder how ppl think he and andrew wiggins compares as far as the current season and their future projected performance goes."
It‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins by a mile.
"Beal is the best player, but you could make a case that Andrew Wiggins was the best prospect"
"If you‚Äôre judging it based on perceived draft stock at the time, then guys like Andrew Wiggins would be higher than James Harden."
"Alright I get it dude. Teams don‚Äôt like walking away empty handed. It‚Äôs happened time and time again. I don‚Äôt see any of that happening, especially for picks and Andrew Wiggins, I just think there‚Äôs another team that can offer a way better deal, that Kawhi would be willing to go to  Miami keeps coming up, Lakers, unfortunately always a possibility. Besides, is that even possible under the cap? Aren‚Äôt the Warriors near the hard cap as is?"
"Flip PG to someone for picks, sign and trade kawhi for Andrew Wiggins and pickaxes"
Wow Andrew Wiggins has summer teeth.
Kelly Oubre Jr. and Andrew Wiggins
This thread is full of people saying Jimmy sucks. You claim these people have always felt this way and it isn‚Äôt just a bunch of idiots reacting to two games. I‚Äôm just wondering what their reaction was to Jimmy putting up a 40 point triple double in the finals. Not really sure how you could come to the conclusion that he‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins with a friendly whistle after that game.
"If they were ‚Äúnot good‚Äù they wouldn‚Äôt stick in the NBA. That‚Äôs the argument. The NBA doesn‚Äôt mess around and let people in for a decade that don‚Äôt belong.   Being a below average NBA player still makes you better than most players in the world. Being an NBA superstar is basically impossible. A scrub is Anthony Bennett, not Andrew Wiggins.   The expectations for NBA players are absolutely insane - the level of expectation for every lottery pick is like that of a top 5 drafted QB in the NFL. Just because you are not a star doesn‚Äôt make you a bust."
the fact that andrew wiggins is better than jimmy butler is common knowledge.  Nephews on this site man smh ^(/s)
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
andrew wiggins with a square head
Jimmy Butler is just Andrew Wiggins with a friendly whistle and anger issues
"If Andrew Wiggins was on the free market he would easily get mid 20s if not more. A good shooting, efficient 18 point per game wing who plays above average defense is super valuable, and super hard to replace."
It's all over the place if you search but this looks like an alright article about it: https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/andrew-wiggins-reportedly-asked-canadas-national-team-pay-play-191953873.html
There's this article which I think helps sum it up well  https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/andrew-wiggins-reportedly-asked-canadas-national-team-pay-play-191953873.html
This year's Andrew Wiggins
"Ah, like noted Canadian grind dogg \[checks notes\] Andrew Wiggins."
"I'm not concerned. I really like what we see.   I honestly think we should look into what value James Wiseman has on the trademarket. Despite a few flashes of greatness, I just don't think he's going to pan out to be that good, nor do I think he will be an impact player during Steph Curry's window. We could bring in a few veteran players on a trade and sign a free agent center or two. They don't have to be star athletes, they just need to be fundamentally solid like Bogut and Za. No need to find a freak athlete, just somebody who can set a pick and roll, and rebound. That's all we need.  I'm hoping Klay comes back strong, and I'm not stacking the odds against him because we all know how bad he wants it. Case point, look at Durant. If he can come back at that level, we will be just fine.  As for the roster, it's shaping up well. I like a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins. Throw in a veteran center, or Kevon Looney and you have something cooking. JTA should take off some of the pressure from Klay Thompson. He will make a great sixth man. Jordan Poole is really coming along and will make an excellent backup point guard to Curry. I'm looking forward to seeing a healthy Eric Paschal. And to be honest bringing back Kelly Oubre Jr for the right price it's probably a good move considering he had a terrible first two months of the season and still finished with 15 points average. He adds some necessary size and length off the bench at the forward position.   Don't trade Wiggins, he's only 26 and just really coming into his own. I was in awe at how well he was playing defense in the first half of that Lakers game. Hopefully he can build upon that. However, I feel like we can recreate the 15 and 16 team with Wiggins instead of Harrison Barnes. Wiggins definitely has the higher upside.   But, much of that is riding on whether or not Klay Thompson comes back healthy. Personally, I would never count him out. He has the heart of a champion and is a straight killer. As long as he is still a spot up shooter, we should have a great second option on the perimeter and somebody dangerous that you had better not leave open in order to double team Steph Curry.  We really need to tailor the game plan around Steph Curry getting double teamed, so we can find the open guy and get the best shot. Obviously this will require ball movement and ball security! Emphasize ball security! That has been our Achilles heel.   I'm crossing my fingers that we can add a 4th or 5th pick from Minnesota this year because we can add some talent with an extremely high upside, plus a building block for the future.  The entire league better be on lookout next year because the Warriors are coming full steam ahead."
"Yeah, when someone gets by him he has Embid.   Draymond has... Kevon Looney?  Andrew Wiggins?"
The reverse Andrew Wiggins then.
"I‚Äôm not bothered, Steph is fun but the rest of the Warriors not so much, meanwhile the Grizzlies are packed with entertaining players. I don‚Äôt wanna watch Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins when I could watch Dillon Brooks and JJJ instead."
Do you mean Andrew ‚ÄúMr. 40 inch vert lay in‚Äù Wiggins?
Honestly GSW Andrew Wiggins in playstyle and pat bev in personality
You see the ball goes in the basket and sometimes that's tough.  I don't understand why they can't do it either.  Do they need Andrew Wiggins or something.
"Julius ""Andrew Wiggins"" Randle"
"I don't think Andrew Wiggins likes basketball. The only thing he seemed to be excited about was possibly playing for the Raptors, that was it. I think if Toronto had acquired him he would've been a different player."
"Curry simply because of the limited team.  They finished the season with a 8 man roster with 2 of their bench players just coming off /still on 2 way contracts and Jordan Poole. That's it. Lol  Wiseman, Kelly, and Eric got injured. Damion Lee got covid. So for him to make the playoff seeding as the legit 8th seed with Andrew Wiggins and dray as his 2 and 3, he had a hell of a year."
Being the third best player doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre the third option.   I‚Äôd argue that Draymond Green is a better player than Andrew Wiggins. But he‚Äôs like the 4th or 5th option.
AG has that Andrew Wiggins vibe where it‚Äôs frustrating to watch him play because you know he‚Äôs better than what he‚Äôs doing on the floor. Flashes and teases of potential great but actually is just painfully slightly above average
Idk buddy have you seen Andrew wiggins' contract?
Harden's out here playing like a glorified Andrew Wiggins...
ive watched more andrew wiggins than you could possibly imagine
I mean stats wise curry did as well as harden. Also those harden teams had a better supporting cast than this warriors team. Yes draymond is a great defender but he‚Äôs a liability on offense and was playing 4 on 3 on offense and still was a liability   Their second best offensive player was Andrew Wiggins who‚Äôs an average at best offensive player in terms of efficiency and then everyone else is even worse  Harden had some actual good role players along with him like ariza Gordon tucker capela Beverly and the last few good Dwight years  Harden did a great job getting the rockets in position but they did not have comparable supporting casts
"**OVERTIME**  Unlikely hero with the deep shots in OT as Grayson Allen hits us with bay to back threes, including one after another out of whack pass by Stephen Curry out of the double team. [The vision of Tillman for the assist in the first one is marvellous, in opposition to the abhorrent transition demesne by the Dubs on the latter one.](https://i.imgur.com/5opZ7T6.mp4)  [Jordan Poole with the clutch shot to put Golden State up 2](https://i.imgur.com/apWIKIO.mp4) and Tillman makes up the miss in regulation on the opposite corner, [with a beautiful feed by the best jumping passer in the NBA](https://i.imgur.com/6eZmCeZ.mp4).   The rough patch continues for Wiggins who missed both jumpers, including a 3-point attempt that doesn‚Äôt even touch the rim. After Poole dribbles off his leg, it‚Äôs up to Ja to clinch the playoff spot. He attacks JTA 1v1, spins inside and [hits the floater - the shot that has served him so well this year - scoring his 35th point in 29 shots, including 5-10 from deep](https://i.imgur.com/2itlkSS.mp4).  Poole [shows up again for a miracle shot and a glimpse of hope](https://i.imgur.com/A6KB3B2.mp4) but there was not enough time to do another comeback.  [Memphis‚Äô defense was the main story](https://i.imgur.com/DgdcXmp.mp4) and I honestly never expected that would have been the case - it‚Äôs what brought them to the position of advantage they enjoyed for most of the game. They had more steals than turnovers! Incredible display on the road with high pressure for such a young team.  Put some respect on Dillon Brooks‚Äô name because these 2 games he‚Äôs been just outstanding defensively, and the support he got inside to avoid cuts to the rim was great as well. Tillman did a fantastic job coming off the bench, especially on defense in the balancing act of covering Draymond Green and making sure to contain Steph enough to give time for Dillon to recover. And Ja Morant made the most of every chance in a way that he didn‚Äôt on the previous game in a great display of control and poise (He even had some great defensive plays, both top-locking Steph himself or bothering people on recoveries). Not to mention the shots by Allen or the masterclass that Kyle Anderson put out there.  For the Warriors, it‚Äôs hard to make any takeaway expect it is impossible to win when turnover over the ball in such a way - and that has to fall on Curry and Green, combining for 13. It seems to an extent that they had all these high intensity games caught up to them but the expectations at this level are cold and ruthless. Like in the Lakers game, they had a TOV% and an Opposition FT Rate both crossing 20%. So once again, they win the half-court battle but are completely destroyed in transition (160 ORTG in transition plays for the Grizzlies this game on CleaningTheGlass. That‚Äôs a lot btw.)  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **NOTES:**  Great adjustment making sure to match Brook‚Äôs minutes as much as they could with Steph after the way he got hot against Melton the previous game.  Not just the terrible lost possessions, but Dray was so much less impactful on defense than he‚Äôs been the last few weeks. Another indication the fatigue caught up to him.  Since the broadcast didn‚Äôt call it out, [just want to give props to Looney for the great seal here](https://i.imgur.com/XmkiyNw.mp4).  The Jordan Poole rise is something I will never understand but something I will always be thankful for. He simply came back from the mid-season G-League bubble as a great player. His decision making is surprisingly good and that was visible in multiple points down the stretch. Honestly, if they wanted to have him out there (and I agree it was the right call), he should have gotten more on-ball plays, getting Curry less times facing a double team and taking the ball out of a cold Andrew Wiggins.  Mulder‚Äôs shot has just not been reliable enough in these games. 1-8 from deep in the Lakers and 2 Grizzlies games.  Kyle Anderson is such a solid 2-way player and such an unconventional entertaining watch. He got a huge amount of responsibilities on help defense this game and [absolutely delivered](https://i.imgur.com/prSALaH.mp4). A very well earned +11 on the night."
"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors‚Äô execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip‚Ä¶](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6‚Äô9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV‚Äôs threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.

This was immediately followed by [the ‚ÄúCurry experience‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph‚Äôs 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don‚Äôt have Draymond‚Äôs help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV‚Äôs gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can‚Äôt switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).

Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven‚Äôt mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray‚Äôs drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant‚Äôs shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an ‚Äúso wide open its practice‚Äù 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond‚Äôs drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn‚Äôt make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn‚Äôt capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."
Only if your owner makes Wiggins look him in the eyes and [promise to play better. ](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20277493/minnesota-timberwolves-owner-glen-taylor-wants-meeting-andrew-wiggins-gets-max-deal)
For real. Good O better D on this one.  Andrew Wiggins had an off night there.
"I would say 13 isn't a good pick for this draft. I'm a casual  when it comes to drafting so don't take this on my word but it seems to be a very top heavy draft. Still that's a lottery pick they can use as leverage and the Wolves pick if they keep it should be a nice prospect. Having two lottery picks, Andrew Wiggins, and potentially Wiseman as trade offers is a pretty nice place to be in."
Andrew Wiggins has never uttered those words.
"Andrew Wiggins spent his entire season rehabbing his reputation and game to do the most Wiggins thing in the single moment it counted.    I wish you luck, Wiggins, on whatever team you‚Äôre on next season."
"I respect your opinion but definitely disagree. Sure it would be better for college hoops if A-list players still wanted to play 4 years, but I think the sport is still intriguing and fun to watch even with a couple of the big powers (Duke and Kentucky primarily) being 1&amp;Done factories. I would certainly disagree that the NCAA hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù in decades, I‚Äôd say as recently as 2019 with Zion the NCAA was immensely relevant. Duke was all over SportsCenter and everywhere else. Plenty of good college teams are still built on the backs of numerous 4-year players. This year‚Äôs champ, Baylor, was an absolutely incredible squad that shot over 40% from deep *as a team* and featured 6 upperclassmen among their most prominent ~8 players, and no freshmen. I personally am a Kansas fan and though we‚Äôve sent some 1&amp;Dones to the league (Josh Selby, Xavier Henry, Ben McLemore, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre, Josh Jackson come to mind), most of our actual best players over that time frame have been 3-4 year guys like Sherron Collins, Cole Aldrich, Thomas Robinson, Tyshawn Taylor, Perry Ellis, Devonte‚Äô Graham, and Frank Mason. Idk, it probably helps that I grew up a fan of a blue blood, but I love college hoops. I think if anything, what threatens the quality of the sport long-term is the newly relaxed transfer rules. I also have a hard time knocking them though because the kids deserve flexibility, but that will definitely threaten team continuity more than the 1&amp;Done trend."
Andrew Wiggins was their 3rd best player.
I would‚Äôve been in shambles if Golden State won and Andrew Wiggins got into the playoffs on not Minnesota
No he's coming to milwaukee to play with 30ppg draymond and a slightly upgraded version of andrew wiggins
"More than curry slander it's irritation towards the warriors fans who compared this season to Lebrons carry jobs, started talking about WCF before the play in games ended. Other than 1 post acknowledging the grizzlies there was nothing on them in a do or die game.  Yesterday people were talking about how draymond brings it always in the playoffs, he's actually in the DPOY race over Bam, how Andrew Wiggins is way better than what was expected (both points I agree with), today suddenly everyone but Steph is trash."
Andrew Wiggins is better than a lot of contender's 3rd best.
Oh and you can‚Äôt forget one has Bradley Beal next to him and the other has Andrew Wiggins
"Everyone shitting on Wiggins right now just be honest with yourselves and admit you‚Äôre hurt and want someone to blame. Wiggins is not a superstar or all star but yet has those expectations like one. He had a good game. 22 &amp; 10. What more did you want 32 &amp; 15? The warriors didn‚Äôt lose because of Andrew Wiggins, the warriors lost because of turnovers and because they simply aren‚Äôt good enough."
"yeah, with Andrew Wiggins as his third best player and the steep drop off to the rest of the roster with JTA as the fourth lol"
"The difference is when those guys get double teamed there‚Äôs still other superstars out there on the court haha, when Andrew Wiggins is your next strongest player the outlook is not bright. Would‚Äôve been a lot different scenario with Klay"
"Obviously people are trying to capitalize on the loss and get a rise out of GS and Curry fans but ya'll gotta stop with the whole ""LeBron has never had a team this bad"" thing. His 07 team is historically bad and he took them to the finals. Would you rather have a 32 yr old Big Z and Larry Hughes or Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins?"
Welcome to our Andrew Wiggins recovery group - no one is blaming him for the loss just noting he‚Äôs not a starter on a contending or even v good team. Go with Christ
"It's a success of a season to me. Stephen Curry unlocked a higher level of playing, which will only increase in value as he gets re-surrounded with more talent. They developed Andrew Wiggins into a positive impact player with really good defense, something he hadn't done prior to becoming a Warrior. Jordan Poole also made strides, and a number of their G-League style dudes also developed into decent role players that play good defense."
The Warriors should give Andrew Wiggins special goggles that makes every player on the opposing team look like LeBron James. Then they would get the best out of him every game.
I swear everyone was so clutch and then Andrew Wiggins
Godamn all the Andrew Wiggins slander were well deserved. He really needed to step up today and he shat the bed
Awesome game. KYLE FUCKING ANDERSON WAS HUGE.   Watching Andrew Wiggins is always a strange experience. Wouldn't surprise me if the dude probably had 20 again but again though.
"Andrew ""Playoff P"" Wiggins"
Andrew ‚ÄúPlay-in P‚Äù Wiggins
Don't be surprised to wake up tomorrow and find out that Andrew Wiggins has been placed on the ineligible list by Adam Silver
Not even a warriors fan. But all I have to say is three words. FUCK ANDREW WIGGINS. That three cost them the game man.
That 3 was peak Andrew Wiggins.. what a fucking bust
Where was that Wiggins tonight? Looked exactly how I expect Andrew Wiggins to perform.
Mr. Fantastic Andrew Wiggins sucked so bad lol
Awesome game. KYLE FUCKING ANDERSON WAS HUGE.   Watching Andrew Wiggins is always a strange experience. Wouldn't surprise me if the dude probably had 20 again but again though.
I blame Andrew Wiggins
I sympathize with the Timberwolves so much. I really do. They've basically become my second favorite team this year. Why?   No one should ever have to suffer with Andrew Wiggins as their second best scoring option.
What a terrible game by Mr. Fantastic Andrew Wiggins
Gotta feel for Steph. Amazing year and turnovers/Andrew Wiggins ended your season before a playoff run
Why Andrew Wiggins is a basketball player?
Don't let these final moments of the game distract you from the fact that Andrew Wiggins is awful
"Andrew ""Maple B. Jordan"" Wiggins yall"
"Great game, game winning shot by Wiggins for Memphis. Thanks Andrew."
Steph deserves better than Andrew Wiggins. Jesus christ
Andrew Wiggins is so fucking sorry. He SUCKS
Andrew Wiggins lol. Jesus Christ. Good game Memphis.   Chase Center is cursed
Andrew Wiggins is fucking cheeks lol
"That's how we lose this game, Andrew Wiggins and shitty turnovers"
Nobody is less clutch than Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins is so freakin bad
Never change Andrew Wiggins
seriously stop andrew wiggins from ending a possession ever again
Bruh keep the ball away from Andrew Wiggins at all costs
"Reminder that on the Mismatch today, it was prophesied that this game would come down to an Andrew Wiggins game winner attempt."
Andrew Wiggins should donate his athleticism to someone less fortunate.... just wasting it
"Get Curry some fucking help.   It's so hard to watch the game be at the hands of Andrew Wiggins. While very skilled, he really lacks a killer instinct to really take him over the edge"
I see Minnesota Andrew Wiggins got some minutes tonight
Hot Take. Kwame brown is a better #1 pick than Andrew Wiggins.
Andrew Wiggins the only one having a worse game than the refs
andrew wiggins should be in the BAL
It's Andrew Wiggins ... He was who we thought he was
Andrew Wiggins with a lot of bricks tonight
I won my fantasy basketball league this year with Andrew Wiggins on my team all season. AMA.
Andrew Wiggins turning into Andrew Wiggins at a bad time
Andrew Wiggins is so disappointing
Why does Golden State give Poole and Juan the ball. Do they forget they got #1 pick Andrew Wiggins.
Kent Bazemore Andrew Wiggins not shooting 80% and getting foul calls OH NO!!
Is Andrew Wiggins good
Andrew Wiggins gotta stop doing that rabbit hop and actually help Curry out. This is getting embarrassing.
"Warriors too! We have Steph, Andrew, Curry, Wiggins, and that sky fucker dude. Easy 5"
"It's not a huge team accomplishment but have you seen how bad the team around him was? They figured some stuff out this last stretch of the season but it was god awful. They went 1-7 or something without him. James Wiseman was more negative than Steph was positive. Kerr benched Poole and JTA for Wanamaker and Oubre. Meanwhile averaged 32 points on 65.5 TS% while being double and triple teamed constantly. He literally had 2016-like numbers with Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole as his two next best offensive players. And he LITERALLY carried them to the playoffs, so how could you say he can't?"
"Cherry-picking bench players to fit your point. When your second-best player averages 7 pts a game and your third best player is Andrew Wiggins, I think that's all the proof you need. At least Dame had a 20+ pts/game side-kick who can create his own shot."
"Have you seen his team? Not the greatest.  Kerr said it best, often players are a product of their circumstance.  Case and point: Andrew Wiggins.  I think LaMelo would have flourished on the warriors"
Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins Revenge game
"Not very good. But the way teams guard Curry is unlike anything we‚Äôve seen before and it‚Äôs amplified on a team with Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole as the next best scorers. Lakers played Curry great, but he still put up an efficient 37 and his mere presence on the court was generating open looks for teammates‚Äîthey just couldn‚Äôt execute."
All this talk about refs and dray can talk shit and headhunt. Meanwhile lest you forget I once gave Andrew Wiggins my buttocks in an airport toilet
It‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins. Lol
Andrew Wiggins is making LeBron pay for trading him for Kevin Love üò≠
I‚Äôve never seen Andrew Wiggins look so serious in Minnesota lmao
I‚Äôm officially an Andrew Wiggins fan account now
"Ahh yes, Andrew Wiggins, the Warriors savior. Just like we all predicted."
Andrew Wiggins is the best former cavalier in this game
I wanna suck off Andrew Wiggins
Go of Andrew Wiggins
"Just woke up from a coma, why is andrew wiggins the best player of all time?"
Is Andrew Wiggins outplaying Anthony Davis? Am I just way too hyped on Wiggins trying?
Bro do not fucking tell me Andrew Wiggins is about to beat LeBron james out of the playoffs at his home LMAO
Andrew Wiggins filling in for Kelley Oubre energy just now.
Andrew Wiggins has certainly answered. Thank you.
Andrew Wiggins is gonna need to help Curry now smh
"Andrew Wiggins giveth, Andrew Wiggins taketh away"
2017 Andrew Wiggins has logged on
Wiggins becomes Maple Jordan for like 2 minutes then goes back to Andrew
Andrew Wiggins proving Lebron right for kicking him off the Cavs
Andrew Wiggins is so shit I have no words
Let me tell you a story about Andrew Wiggins. He will disappear when you need him.
Andrew Wiggins on Lebron Revenge game?
Suns furiously scouting Andrew Wiggins' moves.
"Shout out to Andrew Wiggins man, love to see him do well."
It‚Äôs actually more like:  ~~Kevin Garnett~~ ~~Al Jefferson~~ ~~Kevin Love~~ ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ ~~KAT~~ ~~Jimmy Butler~~ ~~KAT again~~ Ant
"Yeah, Bam has had Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro, Andre Igoudala, Dwyane Wade on his team, while KAT's best form of help in his entire career is Andrew fucking wiggins. It's like saying Jrue Holiday is a better player than Lavine because of success"
I think they need to trade Andrew Wiggins and possibly Wiseman and get someone decent. That would make them even scarier imo.
"He's an undersized scoring guard who can be a black hole on offense. His defense isn't anything to write home about either. He's a good player, but he's not a great player. He's a guard version of Andrew Wiggins. Sometimes he can be incredible, but a lot of the time he's just pretty good, and has a green light since his team sucks."
"hey man, ya'll are excited, it's all good. I'm just saying, I've seen this happen so many times. people projecting from a hot streak when the X years or prior data is much more informative. for every Julius Randles that do make a jump, there are 50 other Andrew Wiggins that just are what the stats say they are"
Andrew Wiggins + James Wiseman for KP + ... Josh Richardson? The money works.
"I still don't understand this event.  ""Andrew Wiggins - recruited by Black Panther""...what?"
I almost think you‚Äôre thinking of Andrew Wiggins
Lmao Andrew Wiggins has zero chance at the hall
"Ricky Rubio, Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Love, Kevin Garnett, KAT"
"My only deal is I‚Äôd be adding him to a team that already has Anthony Edwards, Caris LeVert, Andrew Wiggins, Chuma Okeke and Devin Vassell at wing üòÖ"
"Yeah, but just wait until tonight. Andrew Wiggins is about to become a Marvel Super Hero."
"Steph had Andrew WIGGINS, a number ONE overall pick, of course he should have won against the Frozen One"
&gt;Yeah but that 3rd team all nba center couldn‚Äôt keep them even close to .500 without butler.  Because his next best teammate was Andrew Wiggins. Do you think they'd be a higher seed if KAT didn't play 30 games and Butler was healthy all season long?
Do you not realise he had a 3rd team all NBA center next to him who played all 82 games? And yeah they were almost out of the playoffs because Thibs created a shit roster. The 3rd best player was Andrew Wiggins who had the worst year of his career.
"I thought Ant might be in the vein of rj barrett/andrew wiggins/demar derozan with good but not great upside.  Watching him the past month, I don't know anymore.  He wont be better than Lamelo this year or next or the year after, but he has such physical tools that when his proprioception catches up to his explosiveness in his mid 20s he might be worth his draft position."
You‚Äôre fence if you think the Warriors are beating the Suns. All the Suns have to do is load up on Steph because Andrew Wiggins damn sure isn‚Äôt beating them
"Yeah it's an interesting thing, the debate between what's skill and what's athleticism. I think it can be both, but if you watch someone like Andrew Wiggins, for instance, there's just an innate difference in their movements that can't be gained through skills. Kyrie has way more mobile hips, can sink lower to the grown, can twist and turn in closer spaces and just flat-out maneuver in ways that Wiggins cannot, because Wiggins lacks the coordination and his feet aren't capable of being in those positions.   &amp;#x200B;  [https://youtu.be/w6zQb-oqQh4?t=152](https://youtu.be/w6zQb-oqQh4?t=152)  \^\^\^\^ this is an interesting look at it, looks at the positions he can get into, the angles he can move, etc. Someone like Wiggins, or a Paul George, cannot move this way, and the applicability of these traits are just as much as being quick/fast (which Kyrie is anyway) and probably more so than being able to jump super high. If Wiggins could maneuver like this, I think he might be up a tier as a player. It's a quality Kobe and MJ also had. You can do ball handling drills, all that, but this is NFL running back/cornerback body control/mobility. John Wall is kinda mediocre when it comes to this. DWade was great at it.   I'd give the athleticism nod to Wall because his raw power and maximum explosion I think give him a little bit more of an ability to get by on raw physicality, but Kyrie isn't far behind, and when I watch them, I've never seen a huge difference, all things considered. Similar speed/quickness, both strong (wall stronger), Wall has more vertical explosion, Kyrie has way better agility/mobility."
"Fairly decent list, but recent All-stars should not be exempt because Khris Middleton is one of the best 3&amp;D players &amp; Klay Thompson is probably the GOAT3&amp;D.  7 Gordan Hayward is a playmaker &amp; a tone setter, you should feel weird putting him here because it is)  13 Tobias Harris is avg 20ppg, he's more of a dynamic scorer than 3&amp;D  19 When I think of Brogdan, I think Primary Ball-handler  25 Andrew Wiggins, haven't watched much GSW but in Minn, he was a scorer, has he turned into a shooter?  28 FVV was draining unassisted 35 footers in the 2019 NBA Finals while sharing the court with Kawhi, Lowry &amp; Beyblade"
Is Andrew Wiggins good? Warriors fans have insisted he's a different player in Kerr's system but I'm not seeing it. Looks like the same player with less volume to me.
"Just say you don't watch any Warriors games. Andrew Wiggins, aside from letting Luka murder him the other day, has been a significantly improved defensive player."
Andrew Wiggins is shooting 38% from 3 this year. Julius Randle is shooting 42%. Joel Embiid is shooting 37%. Stop it.
Andrew Wiggins = Avery Johnson  Devin Harris = Ludacris
Andrew Wiggins for sure with how he‚Äôs played this year in a better environment
For...LeBron James. Great point man.  It‚Äôs not like they pulled him for Andrew Wiggins.
"Andrew Wiggins would look good playing alongside AD and Lebron as well. The problem is CJs contract, he‚Äôs not worth the amount"
"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who‚Äôs a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don‚Äôt speak for me.  &gt;And again it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôve just been doing ok all year, we‚Äôre the #1 seed right now. We‚Äôve also had plenty of games where we‚Äôve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven‚Äôt had ‚Äúmany games‚Äù with zero stars on the court. That‚Äôs just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you‚Äôre a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I‚Äôm not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I‚Äôm also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I‚Äôm fine with superteams. I just don‚Äôt think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don‚Äôt agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn‚Äôt make me a hater.   &gt;If you‚Äôre not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you‚Äôre just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I‚Äôve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn‚Äôt make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That‚Äôs not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is ‚Äúonly‚Äù a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"I‚Äôm saying on paper our roster shouldn‚Äôt be good when we don‚Äôt have 2 of our stars on the court. But because marks has consistently provided diamonds in the rough we have been good even with just one star on the floor.   Again before the season if you asked who‚Äôs a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.   And again it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôve just been doing ok all year, we‚Äôre the #1 seed right now. We‚Äôve also had plenty of games where we‚Äôve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.   Just seems like you‚Äôre a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining. If you‚Äôre not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you‚Äôre just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped."
"Andrew was a damn good rookie, he won ROTY after all and played well. His problem was that he never really improved too much after his first couple years and if you compare his aggressiveness when driving as a rookie and 2nd year and his current play it's kind of night and day. In addition, Wiggins is a bust relative to his max contract and expectations. He had the nickname Maple Jordan lmao, people are going to expect big things from you after that. But he's a good player that a lot of teams would want to have, maybe just not his contract. A real bust is someone like Anthony Bennett"
"[Andrew Wiggins](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wiggian01.html) had about 10 games like this as a rookie and he was, absolutely, a bust."
"Better leader than CP3. Remember game 6 of a WCSF in 2019. CP3 had better tm8s than Steph with Harden, etc. and we all know what happened then. That thunder team, while lacking stars, was deep and had plenty of solid NBA players, along with SGA whos a good playmaker, something that Curry lacks. Curry's a great leader, we all know what he can do with a good team around him, and this season the Warriors have been 6 games above 500. There's a reason he's a lock for first team All NBA whole Paul is fighting for a third team spot. If the Warriors had CP3, their offense would be nonexistent, with the best scorer being Andrew fucking Wiggins, and CP3 is no longer a great defender. Steph and CP3 aren't even comparable at this point in their careers, start hating on someone else buddy."
"Linus: ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, former #1 draft pick, Andrew Wiggins!‚Äù"
Andrew Wiggins if he counts as a role player
Ya if we were talking about the Warriors best player (Andrew Wiggins) and Kyrie then that would be interesting. MVP ranking right now is:   1) Cam Johnson (18 RPPG)  2) Kyrie   3) Wiggins  4) Jae Crowder  5) Theo Maledon  6) Paul Millsap

"The warriors have Kelly Oubre who on occasion can shoot the ball and pass, today he could do neither.  The warriors have Andrew Wiggins who is solid on defense but inconsistent on offense. Today he couldn't buy a bucket.  The warriors have Draymond who doesn't try to shoot the ball.  The warriors have some coachable youngsters and new guys.  The warriors only offense today was made by Steph Curry.  Then garbage time started in the third and it made Mulder look less bad in the box score."
Kelly Oubre -41  Andrew Wiggins -35  Lol
Every night before bed I pray for Andrew Wiggins
"Andrew Wiggins, people still have way too high of expectations for what sort of player Wiggins is."
"Imma get hate for this but lu dort. Great player but some people are actually starting to think he‚Äôs better than he really is. For example, a lot of people on this sub would call lu dort better than Andrew Wiggins"
Nothing says 'scrappy underdog' to me like Andrew Wiggins
Amen. Had a lot of arguments about him vs Andrew Wiggins with Warriors fans at the start of the season.
Michael Jordan would be a slightly better Andrew Wiggins in todays NBA so him
"Yes this would be fucking nuts, if he won a ring with Andrew Wiggins as his 2nd scoring option  Then that would be:  2x MVP  1x FMVP  4x Rings"
Even Andrew Wiggins has been at least somewhat decent this season. At the very least he‚Äôs not costing his team like this shit
worse than Andrew Wiggins oml
"Like Andrew Wiggins. The difference between Edwards and Wiggins though is that Ant is a better basketball player. He‚Äôs got a better handle, a better feel for the game, and he‚Äôs a leader. He also has better shooting touch from range and from around the rim.   A guy like Wiggins couldn‚Äôt get past the fact he don‚Äôt care and that he can‚Äôt dribble."

"???  Where did I say they would be worse? Lmao. You‚Äôre reading into hate that isn‚Äôt there.  I‚Äôm just saying Harden would adjust to the Warriors offense, moreso than the Warriors adjust to him. He would absolutely dominate as a top of the key and high post playmaker on this team.  I even said they have a good shot at winning it all, which they don‚Äôt right now. So I have no idea how you‚Äôre reading into this that I think they‚Äôd be worse replacing Andrew Wiggins with James Harden."
"same. I thought atleast the energy/hustle plays would be there. rebounding, running the floor and getting dunks in transition, getting blocks and atleast changing the trajectory of shots under the rim... but nah, the dude looks like he doesn't understand the basic concepts of basketball at times.    as a Warriors fan he's scaring me. he looks like the future Andrew Wiggins of centers. hopefully next year he comes back with a lot more urgency and hustle in his game or I'm afraid he'll never have it."
No ur wrong points only matter my man Iggins Wiggins of Andrew should go to the HOF. Not even debatable.
"KD doesn‚Äôt have to be tier 1, because Steph and Dame are in 2 tiers by themselves, to be a range shooter. Just because there are 2 players better than him at it doesn‚Äôt mean that disqualifies him from the moniker.   Would you say for example Andrew Wiggins isn‚Äôt athletic because Lebron and prime Derrick Rose were both more athletic than him? Doesn‚Äôt make sense"
"Career accolades matters more than just scoring. Kawhi has 900 more career points than Wiggins. Butler has 3 All NBA, 4 All defensive, 5 All Star while Wiggins has none of those. Kyrie has 3 All NBA, 7 All Star, 1 Ring. Embiid has 4  All Star, 2 All Defensive, 4 All NBA and even if he doesn‚Äôt win the MVP this year, he would be second in voting which is something Wiggins would never achieve. You really should do your research before you compare those players to Andrew Wiggins."
"The year is 2023. The KD-is-back Warriors have broken the single season win record with 74-8 after picking up Blake Griffin for 32$/mo at the trade deadline. Steph and KD are both scoring exactly 31.2 ppg each, due to Kerr's new forced sharing policy of not letting the team's highest scorer shoot until someone else catches up. The nets subreddit is shut down in protest of their ownership trading KD for a package of now-DPOY Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.   After a hard fought WCF loss the year before LeBron James decided ""fuck it"" and proceeded to buy the Cleveland Cavaliers. He immediately traded Sexton, Garland, and 20 future draft picks for Himself, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony. They trio meets up with Dwyane Wade in Toronto where the local LeBron fan club has custom built a giant wooden banana boat. Just as the four begin to depart Alex Caruso, who had been hiding in LeBron James' suitcase the entire time, jumps into the last seat. The team now paddles down to Ohio where they proceed to win 32 games, good for 8th seed in the east.   Oubre is now on a two way contract with the Warriors, averaging 28 seconds per game. He has demanded that the ownership ""only play him in the hype minutes"" where the score is close in the final 5 minutes. This has only happened in two games, both against the newly rebuilding lakers.    The two teams meet in the finals after historic dual 12-0 runs. LeBron, now 7'2"", is averaging 48/12/22. As the first game is about to begin, LeBron announces his retirement under the condition that Jordan fans all admit he's the goat if he wins. As the game starts the warriors reveal Kerr's latest revolutionary offensive scheme, dubbed the friendship circle. Every player on the Warriors roster scored 12 points while playing energized defense, leading to a 120-72 victory.  With all the saved energy from reducing his scoring load Blake Griffin is now averaging 12 blocks and 18 rebounds per game.The cavaliers suffer two more losses, 110-65 and 140-83. Lebron has shattered Jordan's scoring record with 70, but Skip Bayless says he is beginning to question whether LeBron has that killer instinct. Game 4 starts 70-24, LeBron heads to the locker room feeling slightly less sad than the Celtics in 2016-17. His teammates, having already given up, start to pour each other shots of Hennessey.   After a 15 minute delay, officials check the locker room only to see black smoke and pentagrams. Just as the officials are about to call the game a forfeit, LeBron James, now 11 feet tall with wings, crashes through the roof of the stadium. Two of the officials begin to question whether LeBron might be taking human growth hormone, but are both quickly fired by Adam Silver. LeBron proceeds to score 85 points over the next 19 minutes to cut the lead to 120-109. 5 minutes left.  Kelly Oubre takes off his jacket and calls on Kerr to sub him in. Kerr, desperate, agrees.   The fans, who have all but given up hope, see their former FMVP Kelly Oubre walk on stage. His energy breathes life into the Arena. With their newly energized defense they manage to hold LeBron to 74 FG%, and the additional stops raised the team's true shooting percentage by 14.8% - just enough to stay in the game. LeBron, clearly out of breath, demands his health team bring him lamb blood and wolfsbane. 150-149 warriors, 2 seconds on the clock, the warriors starting center Alen Smailagic fouls LeBron. LeBron, steps up to the line, but he knows Oubre's tricks. Oubre begins to wiggle his legs, and LeBron laughs and drains the first free throw.   However, LeBron looks back. Oubre hasn't flinched. No reaction, he continues to look straight ahead, wiggling his knees all the same. The pure matador energy radiating from this man captures the entire audience. Everyone is staring at his knees. LeBron shoots his second shot free throw and it rims out. The stadium goes berserk, people are calling Oubre the goat while analysts are saying that missing 1 free throw out of 2 is fairly common for a 70% free throw shooter. Oubre goes 1-4 in overtime but the warriors win anyways. Twitter is seeing a suspicious trend of newly created accounts near SF tweeting #KDsweptLeBronTWICE. Michael Jordan releases a documentary about how he would've won if it were him. Draymond gets FMVP for holding LeBron to 83/22/40"
"&gt;Jimmy and Embiid have about the same number of career points as Andrew Wiggins  There is more to basketball than scoring. Jimmy is an elite defender who lead a team to a finals appearance. Embiid is one of the 2 best, if not the best, centers in not only the current NBA but since Shaq retired."
"On track but still quite far from being a lock. Jimmy and Embiid have about the same number of career points as Andrew Wiggins, Jimmy because he was a late bloomer and Embiid because he's always hurt. Kyrie is the closest but even he needs to keep playing at this level for at least 4-5 more years before he's talked about as a lock."
The andrew wiggins experience.
"I think it was originally Andrew Wiggins, but I feel like I‚Äôve also heard it for Jamal Murray and RJ Barrett"
Wow you‚Äôre really dense.  Warriors could have replaced KD with Andrew Wiggins and they still would have won.
Andrew Wiggins
"Andrew Wiggins has always been a top 300 ball player in this league and if you're disappointed with that, it's on you"
"Giannis was the [sixth youngest player to hit 10k points at 25 years, 45 days] (https://mobile.twitter.com/nbastats/status/1219432519453630465?lang=en) and he's only older than Andrew Wiggins, who just hit 10k himself, by 80 days. (Booker and Towns are a little over 9k.) Giannis could slip to 7th once Booker reaches it in around a half season. Everyone would probably have hit it sooner if these last couple of seasons hadn't been shortened."
"was fully prepared to give a detailed rant on andrew wiggins but i change my mind. Jeff teague was the most frustrating player to watch ever since I've started watching basketball and following the wolves 5 years ago. Pointless dribbling for 20 seconds, refuses to pass to KAT even when he's wide open, takes shots when theyre contested but swings it when hes open. We had a season where Towns regularly had games where he took less than 9 shots and I highly believe teague is partially the reason why. Just remembered we traded rubio away for him too. fuck me"

-Andrew Wiggins after the Nerlens Noel incident
Andrew Wiggins James Wiseman
MCW obviously or andrew wiggins  but Ben Simmons deserves a shoutout for regressing in his career. big clap for Simmo the Slayer
Expecting Andrew fucking Wiggins to lead a competent offence is comical
"‚ÄúOf course he won that year, the Warriors were stacked!  Anyone can win a championship when they‚Äôre carried by *checks notes* Andrew Wiggins and *checks notes* DNP-Achilles Tear!‚Äù"
Steph's second option all season has been Andrew Wiggins and seeing all kinds of coverages on a nightly basis. This ain't the burn you think it is breh.
"nah man, steph curry has never played on a team without 4 all stars. i mean look at the incredible all star talent on this team like Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Draymond Green and Juan Toscano Anderson.   If he ever plays on a team with no talent there's no way he'd ever get to .500 or even make the playoffs"
#IGGINS WIGGINS OF ANDREW
This game was carried by Wigs and Oubre... *check notes*  **WIGGINS OF ANDREW &amp; TSUNAMI PAPII WTF**
"Nash had a much better team around him than Curry has right now. All-Star Shawn Marion, MIP Boris Diaw, 6moy Leandro Barbossa, Amare's best year arguable in 2005. And I don't think you can 100% give Nash all the credit for these guys performing well.   Who is the second best player on the Warriors now? Andrew Wiggins?? Draymond Green, who is having one of the worst offensive seasons? I know Jokic is still the frontrunner but Steph is incredibly valuable to his team. I honestly think they'd be significantly worse than the Twolves without him."
"It‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins‚Äô league, and we‚Äôre just living in it."
He‚Äôs shooting 42.5% for the season with Andrew Wiggins as his second option.  Shut your dumb ass mouth.

Wellcome to NBA Marvel telecast, where the rules are made up and the points don't matter"
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."

It is at least publicly known Wiggins plays/played [CoD](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/02/andrew-wiggins-karl-anthony-towns-call-of-duty-nba-video-games-timberwolves) and [Fortnite](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2765469-it-took-my-life-over-inside-nba-players-fortnite-addiction). Not sure what he's been playing lately though.
Ironman Andrew Wiggins is the only player to play in every game for us (so far)
&gt; Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker were both highly regarded as being the NBA‚Äôs next great wings  At least Parker could claims injuries. Wiggins just didn't give a shit. And I say this as a Warriors fan who appreciates him.
Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker were both highly regarded as being the NBA‚Äôs next great wings
"Not to the degree of Andrew Wiggins, he‚Äôs one of the most athletic players in the league. He was an absurd prospect, he just never managed to roll all that natural talent into NBA production.  Just because he‚Äôs not great now doesn‚Äôt mean that he‚Äôs league average in terms of athleticism."
"So Kelly oubre, Draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kevon looney, Jordan Poole and James wiseman are all suddenly g-leaguers? I'll give you Jordan pool, Kevon looney and James wiseman playing like dog shit but the other 3? C'mon.   And Andre Robertson is as g-leaguer as you can get. That season was 5v4 at all times because he literally can't shoot. He made it up with his defense but like....wow his offense sucked."
"if Steph and Klay are healthy they have a great chance. that's the two greatest shooters the NBA has ever seen. they always have a chance. James Wiseman and Jordan Poole should be much improved as well, not saying they're gonna be all-stars but they should be solid contributors. Andrew Wiggins is much better suited to being a third option, and Kelly Oubre is much better suited to a 6th man role if they decide to resign him. the Dubs 2nd round pick from this year Justinian Jessup is doing really well in the Australian league averaging 15 ppg and shooting 40% from 3 on high volume, he'll be coming over next season and could be a decent bench player.   all that said the Dubs can potentially have two lottery picks to add to the bench as well. if they added a backup wing and backup pg in the lotto like Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell they could have a deep bench."
"Andrew ""Pascal Siakam"" Wiggins"
And when Andrew the bum Wiggins misses open layups
Except Andrew Wiggins. I'm convinced that when he isn't playing basketball he's just staring blankly at a beige wall.
If Kobe wasn‚Äôt traded from the hornets he would be Andrew Wiggins
If he won this year he‚Äôd be above jordan lmao.  I‚Äôd like to see MJ carry Andrew Wiggins to a ring vs lebron + ad and KD+Ky+Harden.
His overall numbers for the season are actually very similar to KD‚Äôs rookie season but also similar to Andrew Wiggins rookie season lol. People just forget how ass most rookies are (even the greats)
"If Steph wins a title with ANDREW WIGGINS (who has actually been decent tbf) as his 2nd option, he'd be GOAT level."
Andrew Wiggins this season
Did you just say Andrew Wiggins has underrated athleticism??
Yeah I‚Äôm honestly feeling Iggy vibes from Iggins Wiggins of Andrew. And a bit of Livingston from JTA. Idk maybe just me maybe I just miss them lmao
"&gt;**The roster changed.** Unless you think adding Curry is what changed the 26th best defense into the 7th best defense?  It's more so that they quit tanking and, as such, Kerr started holding the team accountable on that end again. After all, Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, and a rookie James Wiseman‚Äîtheir only new starters from the get-go‚Äîaren't known as elite defenders. :P"
Curry averaged 32 6 and 6 on 42% 3pt shooting and dragged a shitty team to the 8 seed lmao. His second and third best players were Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre...
Dennis Rodman and Klay are both stars these are terrible examples. Can‚Äôt believe you thought Klay and Dennis were in the same realm as Andrew Wiggins smh
"Fred VanVleet, CJ McCollum, Andrew Wiggins, Tobias Harris"
"Dennis Rodman (Not in the league currently but shut up, it's a great example.)  Draymond Green  Andrew Wiggins  Klay Thompson  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, Clarkson is a roleplayer to me. His role is volume scoring off the bench."
"The Spurs had a pipeline of developing star talent with obviously an aging Duncan, Tony + Manu being stars, and Kawhi emerging.   Maybe this could be the warriors if Andrew Wiggins takes another step and James Wiseman and the other young guys develop quicker than the core declines."
Has Andrew Wiggins ever even been to the playoffs???
Actually when you look at Andrew Wiggins as a player and Ben Simmons as a player I think it is a no-brainer.
"&gt;If¬†Andrew Wiggins went back as the best current player and the money to make the deal work, the reward for Philly would, or could, be some combination of 2020 No. 2 overall pick¬†James Wiseman, and 2021 lottery picks Jonathan Kuminga and¬†Moses Moody.  lmao?!"
"T-Mac offered to bring Andrew Wiggins to his personal gym and work with him and show him how to dominate as a 6'8"" super-athletic wing. Wiggins apparently never accepted the offer. Shame because it's hard to imagine a better mentor for him. :-/"
"The wolves and warriors have the same number of rings since 2019 and amount of playoff appearances lmfao  Thanks to dlo, Kat will be here for a while  Let‚Äôs pray steph doesn‚Äôt run away when his second best player suddenly becomes Andrew Wiggins üòÇ"
"‚ÄúHe (Morey) asked for a package of Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders. There was never bargaining. There was only a decline and a hang up.‚Äù Anthony Slater from the Athletic"
"PG: Steph Curry, SG: Jordan Poole, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Draymond Green, C: Kevon Looney. Next 5: Moses Moody, Juan Toscano-Anderson, James Wiseman, Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr."
Andrew Wiggins for salary matching and a handy J for Morey behind the Sip and Save.
When your best teammate is andrew wiggins how much can you realistically do? It's just ridiculous to ignore the context of the teams.
Andrew wiggins should be 10. no @‚Äòs
Andrew Wiggins was 2nd in points until midway through last season till KAT overtook him
"Thats a testament to how bad his teams are, not KAT as a player.   KAT is a Top 20 player and arguably a Top 15 Talent, however when his best teammate is Andrew Wiggins who Steph Curry with an MVP Level Season couldnt take to the playoffs you cant blame KAT."
"Andrew Wiggins gets way too much hate - he‚Äôs just not worth the contract, but for GSW he had a fine, fine season and he‚Äôs still young. Simmons is getting killed these days and it‚Äôs a little unfair. He‚Äôs just a tough fit with his team, but people make him out to be worthless.  I am less convinced than you are that Russ gets too much hate‚Ä¶ he hasn‚Äôt modified his inefficient game out of pure stubbornness and it does make him less valuable. Some pundits love him without remorse and some are more critical.   Your too much love list is spot on."
Andrew Wiggins is on the team.....so no
Andrew Wiggins
"Jokic and Dame then try to get guys like Lonzo, RoCo, Mikal Bridges, Andrew Wiggins, Jae Crowder."
"&gt;Jeff Teague/Andrew Wiggins/Jimmy Butler/Taj Gibson/KAT held the 3rd seed for most of the season   They went from the 3 seed to the 8 seed because Jimmy Butler got injured. They were 37-22 when Butler played and 10-13 when he didn't play. So they had a 63% win percentage when he played, which would have been the 3rd best in the west.  &gt;I don't see how D'lo/Anthony Edwards/?/Ben Simmons/KAT can do any worse  1: because the game is not played on paper. If you think D'lo/Edwards/?/Simmons/KAT can compete for a 3 seed, then why couldn't D'lo/Edwards/Beasley/McDaniels/KAT compete for anything last year?  2: because Jimmy butler is a better floor raiser than any of KAT, Simmons, etc. Already showed the wolves record with/without him &amp; the heat in his 2 seasons are 71-39 when he plays 13-22 when he's out."
Jeff Teague/Andrew Wiggins/Jimmy Butler/Taj Gibson/KAT   held the 3rd seed for most of the season so I don't see how  D'lo/Anthony Edwards/?/Ben Simmons/KAT can do any worse lol.
Does Andrew Wiggins count?
"How have you watched the league the last 4 years and not understood by now that the cap is mostly imaginary. You can move any money for any money mostly at any time unless you're wildly over the salary cap.   How many of the ""worst deals around the league"" have moved just in the last 2 or 3 offseasons? Because off the top of my head i can count John Wall, Kemba Walker, Mike Conley, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook twice, Chris Paul twice, Andrew Wiggins, Marc Gasol, Kristaps Porzingis and I'm probably forgetting a good number.  And we can say anything we want about Ben Simmons in the playoffs or about his mental fortitude, whatever. He is at worst the 40th-50th best player in the league. At worst. His athleticism, build and skillset on defense make him uniquely valuable in raising the floor of a team in a way not many guys in the league can do, and said skillset fills a lot of holes for Minnesota. And the kicker is he's coming at the lowest cost he could possibly come at. Based on current valuation I'd say Ben Simmons is the highest upside bad contract in the league. By a country mile. Acquiring Ben Simmons does more for Minnesota at this juncture then any free agent they could hypothetically sign within the next couple offseasons because they're scheduled to be past the cap til '23 anyways. So this penny pinching really overall is so needless. The Wolves need talent. Go and get talent that's available at an all time low asset cost. This isn't rocket science.  Sincerely, Dumbass"
"He's not really a star, but I've seen so many people do this with Andrew Wiggins. He is still pretty bad, just not as bad as in Minnesota where he was excused because KAT doesn't play on that side of court either."
"He averaged .343 on 3.8 attempts his rookie year, .363 on 5.2 attempts his sophomore year, .383 on 7.1 attempts his third year, and then .326 on 6.5 attempts his fourth year.  Decent volume, but not really ""sniper"" percentages at any point.  Eric bledsoe, christian wood, and andrew wiggins each had a higher 3pt % this year than booker."
Can you prove he didn't tho? I ask because I remember he made a post when he returned stating that he was excited to play with Kyrie and some other players on the Cleveland roster but left out Anthony Bennet and Andrew Wiggins. Maybe he already knew that they were getting traded for Love.
Tell me you dont look at box stats w/o telling me you look at box stats.   Andrew Wiggins is an at best average basketball player.
&gt; He seems oddly casual about  Yes this is Andrew Wiggins.
"\&gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders.  &amp;#x200B;  Lol, What!?"
"Andrew Wiggins is trash.  he is only a name because of his draft status.  If Andrew Wiggins was 2nd round pick, he would not be mentioned at all."
"Laugh about his contract now but you know when it will be an attractive, *positive* asset?   In the 2022 off season, when it will be an *expiring* contract. Meaning an immediate free max salary slot for any team going big game hunting in 2023.   If Andrew Wiggins does get traded by the Warriors that's when it would happen."
"&gt;As has been reported, he asked for a package of Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders  Fucking lol."
Good last year Andrew Wiggins is just a better player than Simmons.
"&gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders.  Omegalul"
"But they weren't good when he went to the Cavs. They had literally just gotten two first overall picks in a row (2013, Anthony Bennett and 2014, Andrew Wiggins), to go along with their third one in four years (Kyrie, 2011). They were absolute trash. They traded away Bennett and Wiggins for Love before the season started (after LeBron had agreed in free agency), and were still loaded with young guys until the majority were traded away at the trade deadline for Shump, JR, and Mozgov."
"&gt; in late July that the Sixers asked Golden State for Andrew Wiggins, former No. 2 pick James Wiseman, the No. 7 and No. 14 picks in this year‚Äôs draft and two additional future first rounders."
"He is really not. There's like 7 or 8 wings in the all defence teams. Are you seriously suggesting that Andrew Wiggins is one of the 7 best defensive wings in the league? Is he top 10? Top 25?  Hes above average at best, and that's thanks to Dray's communication backing him up. He has great physical tools and has improved his effort, but he's nowhere near All-nba level"
"Yeah but we‚Äôre talking about compared to maybe the most efficient player ever.  According to [this](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/ts-percentage) last year Steph‚Äôs TS% was 65.5% (8th in the league, top guard in the league).  Kyrie‚Äôs was 61.0%, 41st in league.  The 4.5% difference is the same as the difference between Kyrie and Andrew Wiggins, 91st in the league.  Steph is 3rd all-time in TS%.  Kyrie is 74th (tied with Mike Miller)."
What was he supposed to do?  Play down his asset?  For Andrew Wiggins and a 1st?  It's NEGOTIATION.
"Wolves essentially traded away Kuminga in order to swap Wiggins for D‚ÄôLo. They keep bringing up Andrew being overpaid, while Russell has basically the same contract, just $6M less total spread over the next three seasons, and no one seems to bring that up ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Andrew Wiggins didn't even live up to just being a good enough player to justify using a first overall pick on.
&gt; So you're saying when he was put in an offense that better suit his talents he much performed better. Sounds like it was never really his fault for playing bad in Minnesota.  That type of offence suits a roleplayer.  &gt;Andrew Wiggins is a good NBA player who regularly contributes at an above average level for an NBA starter.  A player you are describing doesn't need to be fed a diet of mostly open looks and catch and shoot opportunities.
"&gt;It's really not the same though. Simmons has flaws that teams can really abuse, I don't really know if the same can be said of Andrew Wiggins anymore.   Dare him to create for himself lol."
"It's really not the same though. Simmons has flaws that teams can really abuse, I don't really know if the same can be said of Andrew Wiggins anymore."
"Idk if that‚Äôs a great way to do that,Andrew Wiggins was the next Jordan but with a junpshot,and he didn‚Äôt amount to much"
"Him, Sidney Crosby, Andrew Luck, and Bryce Harper were all hailed as the wonder kids future GOATs. And he's the only one to stay healthy and maximize his potential.   Sidney Crosby also did a fantastic job living up to his hype as the next one but obviously the concussions sucked. Bryce is fine. But he didn't meet his expectations to the likes of LeBron and Sidney Crosby.   But like I think Lebron's the first athlete who kinda controlled his career and his legacy. Shouts out to the Big O for introducing free agency. Like often we are left wondering what a players career could have been had he been surrounded by talent. How good could Andrew Luck have been had he had better O-line protection. How good could Aaron Rodgers have been had the Packers drafted WRs in the first round instead say a QB. How good could John Elway have been had he had a run game all his career.   LeBron was like ""oh you are not going to get good players in the primes and just get big names past their prime.....alright bet"" and then went out and pulled in Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Then came back and forced the Cavs to correctly trade for Kevin Love even with Andrew Wiggins going to Minnesota.   Lakers and Heat are the only teams who actually set up LeBron to succeed. Cavs didn't do it till LeBron forced them to.   And then dude had a inner circle coming into the league who he lifted to great lengths.   Granted Klutch Sports Group fucked over a bunch of players and I hope Nerlens Noel gets at least $40-50 mil in compensation."
"Of course, that‚Äôs because Portland has way better shot makers. The warriors generated high quality shots consistently, role players just couldn‚Äôt capitalize and that‚Äôs something that steph curry cant control. Blazers on the other have had CJ Mccollum, GTJ, Melo, Powell etc.   The Warriors had Andrew Wiggins as the second best 3 point shooter and scorer on the team. I like Wiggins but that ain‚Äôt gonna work  While the defense was very good, you cant have that bad of an offense in the modern NBA. Hell if it wasn‚Äôt for Curry, the warriors might be one of the worst offensive teams of the last two seasons"
"Jan 8, 2019 Andrew Wiggins combined with Kyrie Irving"
Andrew Wiggins literally played winning basketball last year. Warriors had a winning recored over .500. Not to mention the one year Andrew actually did make the playoff (mostly due to Jimmy Butler but still).
Andrew Wiggins early days would like a word‚Ä¶ not top 10 but hes got some clips
"Poole didn't play half the year because he was in the g league. Damion Lee can shoot but he's not gonna be the difference maker in an offense lol. We didn't even have bjelica or opj last year. It was literally Andrew Wiggins as our sole offensive threat when curry sat for the half season Poole was out, and I'm sure you can imagine how bad that would look as a wolves fan. :)"
"Every fan base. I always see guys making trades and posting like ""this is fair for everyone I think"" when it's like a 2nd round pick and Andrew Wiggins or John Wall for LeBron"
Andrew Wiggins lol  If we include the GTA (greater Toronto area) then I guess SGA?
Iggin Wiggins of Andrew.
I went sifting through Andrew Wiggins' impressive log of playoff game performances to better inform myself for this question. I think I'll still take Ben Simmons.
Andrew Wiggins to Michael Jordan
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
Timberwolves won by 2 points following a ‚Ä¶ 40 point performance from Andrew Wiggins.
"Its clear that Morey values Simmons more than 3 high level starters, look at the trade proposals that have been leaked  &gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in the 2021 NBA Draft, and two future first-round picks.  &gt;Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and the No. 4 pick.  Both of these should indicate the trade value Morey's ranks Simmons.   &gt;The Knicks could have traded Randle, RJ, Mitch and 4 FRPs to the Rockets  If the Knicks were offered that then they would be dumb to pass that up. Harden is perennial MVP candidate and future HOFer in his prime even with the possibility that he would get upset any team would trade for Harden because he changes your team to a contender with just him on the roster.   Harden is not comparable because Simmons is clearly not the level of player he is, and his trade (and outcome of trade) should not be seen as a comparable situation given how the context of the two teams are so different."
Andrew Wiggins Tj Warren Kawhi Leonard
Andrew wiggins
I remember hearing that about Andrew Wiggins for years and to this day he's still not the player anyone thought he would be. Some situations you have to give it up and take sure things (proven players) instead of holding on to your promising prospect. Philly is in that situation. Embiid doesn't have longevity on his side and the 6ers need to win now
Stephs second best teammate is one of the best defenders of all time   KATs is bust Andrew Wiggins   Not even gonna get into the rest of the roster either since that‚Äôs enough
Jordan Clarkson is not better than Andrew Wiggins
Gerald Green  Andrew Wiggins  Paul George
"Andrew Wiggins, Jalen Brown, Kawhi Leonard."
"Teams were tanking to get him. He was called a generational cant-miss talent and budding Superstar.  His scouting report:  ‚ÄúWiggins has the highest upside in the draft outside of Embiid. The All-Star talent is there. Whether he'll be able to tap into it and ultimately assert himself on a game-to-game basis will determine just how far he'll go.   He's going to be a phenomenal player when it's all said and done. The fact that he averaged 17.1 points as a freshman without much refined skill is extraordinary. Still, Wiggins might ultimately be more effective as a Scottie Pippen-like No. 2 option than a Michael Jordan-like No. 1.‚Äù  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2077038-andrew-wiggins-nba-draft-2014-highlights-scouting-report-and-more"
"CJ McCollum or a player of his caliber is very fair. Anything more is an overpay. Shoot they asked for . Andrew Wiggins, 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman, Golden State‚Äôs 2021 No. 7 and No. 14 picks and two future firsts which is insane."
"Average is bad because it skews the line but there are 10 (47.6%) that are 5.3WS or higher. Wiggins being the dotted line makes him 15th out of 21.  Is Wall a bust? Is D-Rose?  2000 Kenyon Martin wasn't a bust because even though he is a below average 1st overall pick.. go look at that draft class. it's a big roster of WHO??   Also for bust, many other factors have to be in discussion.   How bad was the pick compared to other people that team could have taken. Is Hakeem a bust compared to the Jordan they could have taken?  Also are we factoring injuries into discussing busts (Oden, Bias, D-Rose)?   Is Andrew Wiggins a bust.. I would say yes but it's close. joel embiid was taken 3rd that year and Wiggins / Embiid played for Kansas that year for only 1 year and while Wiggins had 20 points per 40 minutes.. embiid had 20 points and 14 rebounds per 40 minutes with a much better defensive rating than Wiggins.   Obviously we have seen Jokic from that same draft breakout to be a star and last year's MVP but that's an anomaly of having a pick that low turning out being a star/MVP. But.. anyone seeing tape of Wiggins in Kansas should have seen Embiid and pick Embiid over Wiggins.   (Edit: All the people above Wiggins have at least 1 season of 5.0 or greater WS)   So yes, Andrew Wiggins is the bust line."
"Marvin Williams, Andrew Bogut, Wiggins, Lonzo Ball so far, Oden...  IMO there's a different level of ""busts"" where they still had a serviceable career, compared to just outright busts like Anthony Bennett."
Andrew Wiggins is a bust.
"Please tell me what player outside of GOAT all time level talent would be able to drag treveon graham, Andrew Wiggins, and Jeff Teague to the playoffs in the west   This take is so fucking tired. Sure he may not be a superstar but if you really think any other player could drag that team to the playoffs not named lebron then you‚Äôre on crack"
"Jrue or Simmons.  In principle, I could see someone like Klay Thompson, though I don't really think he'll elevate his game enough. Andrew Wiggins, who's a 3 who could easily be a 2, he could win if he elevated his game a bit. He had a lot of blocks last season for a wing."
Andrew Wiggins or Tim Hardaway Jr. Different styles but I feel they hold similar value
"Alright lol I'd rather have him do that than Anthony Davis backing up and taking a contested jumpshot over Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole in the GSW Play-In rather than going to the paint. Do you think a ""skilled"" player doesn't know how to use his skills?"
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario ≈†ariƒá   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
Steph got hurt from falling backwards onto some steps that‚Äôs not a case of poor durability that‚Äôs just shit luck‚Ä¶..and if Dame or Harden‚Äôs 35 million dollar 2nd option missed the whole season and they trotted out lineups with Draymond Green and Kevon Looney/Wiseman the offenses would struggle with that spacing ‚Ä¶.at least Dame has 3 respectable shooters on the floor with him at all times. Imagine where Steph would be with CJ on the wing and where Dame would be with the best shooter and only above average shooter in the starting lineup other than him being Andrew Wiggins
Sir that‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins
Derrick Rose  Zach Lavine  Andrew Wiggins  Jimmy Butler  Kevin Love.    Nice little small ball lineup with 4 all stars and Wiggins
"There are people currently stating the GSW roster this year is overrated and Klay is not going to make much of a difference, especially coming off an injury. I believe it's going to age like fine milk. These people really don't know how valuable Andrew Wiggins is now and how Klay just existing on the court would open up a lot of opportunities for the Warriors on offence and the incredible potential on defense with Klay, Draymond and Wiggins on the court at the same time, boosting Curry's role in D too? That's going to be one heck of a defense."
"Since it‚Äôs known Draymond is an elite defender I‚Äôll just talk about offensively.   Draymond offensively is an elite level passer.  He understands defenses and their weakness and he can deliver the ball in the perfect spot for the player he‚Äôs passing to to make the easiest shot.  Some people go for flashy passes which makes finishing the play hard.  Some people are so focused trying to score or overwhelmed with the defense they don‚Äôt see who they can pass too.  Some people only pass if it leads to an assist. Passing is an extremely underrated skill, even if it doesn‚Äôt lead to an assist, good passing as well as player movement keeps the offense flowing.  It doesn‚Äôt allow the defense to set but makes them have to repeatedly makes read which normally breaks down the defense.  Too many players try to iso so often, and while their man may have to work on defense, the defense as a whole doesn‚Äôt have to work and it allows them to rest while a player forces up a bad shot, or makes a shot because they work.  The beauty of the warriors offense is there‚Äôs so much off the ball action that the defense either needs to be aware of everyone at all times which doesn‚Äôt allow them to help if one of the superstars beats their player, or they risk giving up open lay ups and jumpers to players who otherwise can‚Äôt create their own offense consistently.  Draymond has an ability to penetrate the gaps in a defense, while not always looking for his own shot but finding other players to get the easiest possible look for them. It allows the warriors offense to flow.  Contrary to popular belief, he‚Äôs not only finding KD, Klay or Steph for his assists, but the others get a ton of spot up opportunities or back door lay ups when the defense is focusing on the star players.  Compare that to Kelly Oubre or Andrew Wiggins this past season who may penetrate and throw up a consternation midrange because they either don‚Äôt have the vision, ability, or they just don‚Äôt want to make the extra pass to the east shot.  Since he‚Äôs not worried about how many points he scores, you can trust him to make the right decision for the team and not trust try to make himself look good."
Andrew Wiggins is a bust
"It would be Kevin Garnett just so I could have random movies on and here his pregame takes.  &gt;.... He sees me and Andrew (Wiggins) and he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòCome here, come here.‚Äô  So we walk over there. He‚Äôs real into the movie. ‚ÄúYou see this shit right here, this is what this shit‚Äôs about. You die for what you believe in. You die for your boys. This is that mentality we need to have going into the game. It‚Äôs about war. It‚Äôs about going down with your boys. I love this shit. This shit gives me goosebumps.‚Äù  I look, and he actually has goosebumps. I‚Äôm a big KG guy and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm with you man. This is how we gotta play.‚Äù He‚Äôs like ‚Äúright, Zach. You feel me Wiggs?‚Äù  Andrew Wiggins says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know even know what ‚ÄòForrest Gump‚Äô is, I‚Äôve never heard of this movie.‚Äù The look on his face was like perplexed. Not anger, but just like get out of my face. So he just looks at us and says, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall go get ready for the game, man.‚Äù"
Andrew Wiggins. He‚Äôs overpaid sure but that‚Äôs it for 26million a year everyone would be overjoyed with him. Pick status and contract aside he‚Äôs an iron man player and he‚Äôs consistent.
It‚Äôs not like his scoring was what buoyed them in 2015-16.  Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre weren‚Äôt exactly why they had a top 5 defense last season‚Ä¶
does everyone else remember when andrew wiggins was hyped as the biggest prospect since lebron james
"D‚ÄôAngelo Russell is going to be better than Andrew Wiggins at carrying an NBA franchise. I think I said this in either Russell‚Äôs rookie or second season in the NBA. It actually turned out to be true, although it was just for one season (2019). Russell wasn‚Äôt the only reason why the Nets made the playoffs during his last year there but he was leading the way. Wiggins? Doesn‚Äôt have the killer mentality to be that guy."
"Mine was when the Wolves gave Andrew Wiggins the five-year $148 million max contract.   Although I thought that he could develop into a solid player, in no way I believed he would be a star-player worth of a max contract. The Wolves eventually traded him to the Warriors."
There was playoff basketball in Minnesota during the period he's talking about...Andrew Wiggins spearheading that playoff basketball was the miss...
Diet Andrew Wiggins.
Andrew Wiggins wears 22.
He has better shot selection because he got to play with better players than Andrew Wiggins and Jeff Teague for most of his carer.
"You are seriously overrating Lebron James jr lol . Andrew wiggins at 8 is also a bit of a stretch , i love wiggins but i dont think he has the killer mentality to be a superstar . He is a great role player tho"
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ‚Äã"
"Some interesting comments Bleacher Report added.  Andre Drummond (14th) - ""Drummond becomes a passable free-throw shooter and an effective low-post operator to complement his prodigious abilities as a rebounder and pick-and-roll finisher. His near-20-10 production and penchant for spectacular plays earn him All-Star and All-NBA status. His work as the leader of a basketball renaissance in Detroit, though, is what gets people whispering about Drummond for MVP.""  Andrew Wiggins (2nd) - ""Wiggins becomes the fifth unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year and the league's third in the last five campaigns. He follows that up by beginning an extended string of All-Star appearances while spearheading the rebirth of playoff basketball in Minnesota.""  Jahlil Okafor (18th) - ""Okafor, in turn, becomes an All-Star and a reliable 20-10 guy at center.""  Dragan Bender (19th) - ""Bender arrives stateside as a top-five pick in the 2016 NBA draft and develops, in time, into the NBA's next great European import.""  To be fair they predicted a Westbrook MVP, Giannis to develop into what he is today, and Curry to get an MVP and title."
Imagine thinking Andrew Wiggins before he even played an NBA game was going to be better than MVP Stephen Curry
1) Tony Allen  2) Kawhi Leonard   3) Demar DeRozan  4) Andrew Wiggins  5) Charles Barkley   6) Shawn Kemp
"Well, it isn't really a yes or no type of thing. Obviously it has some impact, because everything has some impact. So here's a 'yes' so you can walk away feeling like you won because that seems really important to you for some reason. Keep reading if you want the actual real world answer though.    The Wolves always make bad trades. That's just sort of one of the perks of bad ownership. Who knows what they would've got without that situation deteriorating in the way that it did, but you can bet that they would've found a way to get poor value. Other teams are able to extract value for stars that are publicly forcing a trade, so it's weird to blame Jimmy for the team pulling the trigger on a bad trade.   This shit happens to bad organizations. At no point did Glen Taylor handle any of it correctly. With a well-run organization, maybe the rift doesn't get so public, and maybe they don't kowtow to KAT's demands that they get rid of Butler as precondition of his signing a max, or maybe they wait for a better offer because there is a solid structure in place where they can run it back until the trade deadline. But sure, it's Jimmy's fault that the franchise had the same (low) level of success the two years after he left as they had the 15 years before he arrived.  Unless you are kin to Andrew Wiggins, I'm not sure why you have such an axe to grind here lol"
*Laughs in Andrew Wiggins language*
"no way, it's Tobias and Andrew Wiggins....  &amp;#x200B;  at least Siakam stepped up in the playoffs one year lol"
I'd take injured Kevin Love over Andrew Wiggins. At least he can't shoot you out of games while hurt.
"I don‚Äôt think anyone claimed he was going to be Lebron. No one is going to be Lebron lol, its like looking for another MJ, Kobe or KD. These players are once in a generation type of shit. Even Charles Barkley was incredibly good and to be anywhere at that level is a wild combination of skill, athleticism, work ethic and a dash of winning the genetic lottery.  Zion has many of those factors already. He‚Äôs highly skilled as seen by his ability to dribble and penetrate defenses. His footwork is incredible for a guy his age and he‚Äôs so skilled around the rim that he‚Äôs a bucket damn near anytime a he puts up a shot around there.  His athleticism is absolutely bonkers. We all know about his leaping ability but his speed, incredibly quick first step, explosiveness and agility to couple with his freakish size and strength. This dude is out there looking like a bull buts moves like a gazelle.  Which then leads us to the genetic lottery. His 6‚Äô8 with that kind of athleticism and size. It‚Äôs rare to see something quite like that. Dude is a genetic freak.  So then it comes down to work ethic and drive which is what really separates  the Andrew Wiggins from the Lebrons. Zion plays hard 100% every time. He‚Äôs a little lost on defense sure but that comes with time in the league. His FT shooting has already shown to be improving. His defensive rebounding is much better this year. He will get better with all these things in time and for a guy who‚Äôs played less than 40 games the kid looks absolutely phenomenal."
"James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, and the Timberwolves 1st"
Andrew Wiggins isn't worth a ham sandwich
What are Andrew Wiggins season by season averages?
We‚Äôve already done the trade. We traded Steph for Andrew Wiggins + James Wiseman + Minnesota 1st round pick + 4 future Warrior picks. You guys just don‚Äôt know about it.
After watching Andrew Wiggins. I look at Canadian players like a Starbucks regular that's trying to start a fight. They are  not hungry...not even a LIL. Kelly should get paid if that dude does etc...
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
"Oubre is hot garbage, watching him play he just seems like he doesn‚Äôt know wtf to do on the court. His bbiq is rock bottom, all he can do is dunk. He‚Äôs a void on the court, pair that with Andrew Wiggins and I‚Äôm surprised the warriors have won anything."
"""an""  What I mean is after getting a huge contract, the player does not improve because he is already set with a huge contract.  I didn't mean he will play like andrew wiggins and copy his playstyle."
"So weird to see Wiggins‚Äô development. Back when he was playing with Rubio, Andrew looked elite at finding lanes to cut off-ball and finishing when Ricky feeds him. So different from his playing style now."
Imagine if Pascal ends up being an Andrew Wiggins. Well at least he won a championship so he built different already
Dunno man Lebron missed the playoffs two years ago and no one thinks differently of him. I personally can't fault Steph for not making the playoffs with Andrew Wiggins as the team's second best player.
" &gt;Or better yet, trade him so that I don't have to watch the greatest shooter in the world waste the remaining prime years of his career on a team with Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre.  Toronto pls"
"Ability is ability. Some guys are able to do things and others aren't. Christian Wood is able to do a lot of things that most guys can't.  You're also unintentionally comparing Wood to a guy who was the consensus 1st overall pick and was compared to LeBron throughout highschool. Nobody thinks Andrew Wiggins doesn't have talent, he just can't seem to put it all together consistently and improve."
"Wiggins is literally the second best player on the team on most nights so far.  Which- mind you, is an issue for a team that wants to compete, but Andrew is not anywhere near being the biggest issue with this squad"
"By new I mean, they've never played in it, literally the most familiar player is Andrew Fucking Wiggins"
"They need to run that James Harden offense. There's zero reason to really let anyone else shoot more than like 6-7 times a game. They're all bad at shooting, even worse at thinking. Give Steph the ball, and use everyone else not named Draymond or Wiseman as the traffic cones that they are.  Or better yet, trade him so that I don't have to watch the greatest shooter in the world waste the remaining prime years of his career on a team with Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre."
"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd make them immediate contenders but they‚Äôd be solid at the very least. The gravity that he has on offense alone is enough to give teams fits. It would also thrust players like Wiggins and Oubre into tertiary roles, where I believe they would fair much better off at.   Right now, it‚Äôs the Steph Curry show. Wiseman looks good and I like Paschall off the bench. Kelly Oubre and Andrew Wiggins will have the occasional games where they contribute, but they both struggle with consistency. Adding Klay would fix a lot of problems for that team."
"Andrew ""Markelle ""Kyrie Irving"" Fultz"" Wiggins"
Andrew Wiggins is this generation's Jeff Green except on a max contract
It does for some people. Andrew Wiggins missed over a week with the flu a year or two ago and took about a month before he was fully recovered. We don‚Äôt need to downplay the flu just because covid is more serious
I so desperately wanted OPJ instead of Andrew Wiggins.
He‚Äôs making that Andrew Wiggins money
"If you were Jaylen brown, you‚Äôd be Andrew wiggins. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself"
Trade Cavs legend Andrew Wiggins? PSH
"I hope our defense in this play doesn't undercut the fact that we nearly lost this game because we wouldn't stop giving Andrew Wiggins the ball.  I love Wiggs, but he just isn't clutch."
Andrew Wiggins
Prediction: Warriors get 3 Allstars and Andrew Wiggins makes his allstar debut.
"Look, I know it‚Äôs the Pistons, but it‚Äôs good to see our young core pull out a win without Curry and Green.  What Poole‚Äôs 3-point struggles don‚Äôt show is that he‚Äôs gotten absurdly better at shooting inside the arc. He‚Äôs got a nice pull-up game and his finishing is really nice. When he doesn‚Äôt force things, he‚Äôs immediately one of the deadliest scorers on the court.  Andrew Wiggins has been stellar the last couple of games and he‚Äôs on a hot streak, hope he gets his 3-point percentage back on track as well.  Bjelica, GP2 and JTA are too nice.  Kuminga‚Äôs shot making is a little bit suspect and D-Lee hasn‚Äôt quite found the groove since his injury, and this is after starting the season on fire. Those are really my only concerns that I took away from this game."
Maybe not SAS but Skip Bayless literally brought up a similar point when the Warriors beat the Nets earlier this week. He basically gave most of the credits to Andrew Wiggins and the bench
LeGM just wanna get traded to GSW for Andrew Wiggins at this point.  LeCrypt to Bay Area. To the moon!
andrew wiggins
Andrew Wiggins: 22 points. Currently winning.  Kevin Durant: 0 points. Currently losing and not playing with Steph.
Andrew Wiggins statpadding lol. Denied JTA that assist
Andrew Wiggins sacrificing his body for this game
"6‚Äô8 220 lbs, 40 inch vertical, good jump shot. Did all 4 years in college so he‚Äôs not some raw talent that‚Äôs drafted purely on potential. Was going to a great franchise that had good player development and Larry Bird to mentor him before he was ready to pass the torch over to him.  There‚Äôs no way of knowing, but players in the 80‚Äôs didn‚Äôt bust as often or as hard as they do today. The Celtics drafted a 22 year old that already proved himself in the basketball world. Players like Andrew Wiggins are drafted at the age of 19 and haven‚Äôt proved anything."
"let's not go that far, he is definitely worth more than andrew wiggins pre warriors"
"Easy to have a high TS% if you just dunk.  He's Timberwolves Andrew Wiggins, only instead of being an iron man who never misses games, he sits out for tantrums.  Which means he's less valuable than a player the Warriors got paid a first round pick to take in exchange for D'Angelo Russell, and people thought the Timberwolves won the trade."
"&gt;  Fair value for Ben is an AS  It's really not.  He's a good one-on-one defender, is good running in transition, and a liability in the half-court.  Who won't play if you hurt his widdle feelings.  He is literally less valuable than Andrew Wiggins was when he was traded to the Warriors, and the Timberwolves paid a first round pick to trade him for D'Angelo ""technically an All Star, as a sub, in a historically weak East"" Russell - and at the time people thought they *won the trade*.  Sixers are expending a big haul for a player they should be understanding they need to pay to offload."
"Not when he won't play.  I can name you a young player with potential who got a max contract he wasn't seen to be living up to: Andrew Wiggins. Who probably would have been an All Star in the east.  Warriors got paid a first-rounder to take Wiggins in exchange for a player they themselves didn't really want, and Wiggins *played*. On both ends of the floor.  And everyone thought at the time that the Timberwolves won the trade. But there's a lot less chance that a new environment makes Ben Simmons acquire a whole new mindset, and actually put in the work to learn to shoot.  Sixers firsts are less valuable than Timberwolves firsts, so the Sixers would probably have to package more picks. And if they expect better than a Russell-level player, they're delusional."
"&gt; His value isn't low for a basketball player.  Yes it is.  Because he's not that good a basketball player, he's on a max contract, and he's made it clear if he receives the slightest criticism ever he'll throw a tantrum about it.  Simmons has always been evaluated as the player he hypothetically could be, but he's never lived up to that.  You remember how much criticism Andrew Wiggins used to get?  You remember that the Warriors received a **first round pick** just for taking him?  And Wiggins played every game."
Andrew Wiggins for Ben Simmons
Andrew Wiggins lol
"As they play the warriors who‚Äôs second best player is Andrew Wiggins. Their rotation  is a team full of G leaguers   ‚ÄòNo help‚Äô is an unfortunate side effect of the anomaly that was Lebron in Cleveland (the first time around). That was a very unique situation.   Since then, and in today‚Äôs game, it‚Äôs damn near impossible to really have ‚Äòno help‚Äô. But Stephen A‚Äôs clown ass and others have helped create an environment where stars get passes and role players get blamed. Which is ass backwards.    This man has James gotdamn Harden. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters‚Ä¶EVER. Lamarcus Aldridge is contributing. Bruce brown is the same guy who was lauded as a glue guy just months ago . Like get this out of here   Not only that, they‚Äôre 10-5! Get Stephen A off the air man. He has too much power and he really effects the culture of how people talk basketball"
"Umm did you watch the game last night? Wiggins D had Harden locked down. Yeah I said Wiggins, Andrew Wiggins locked down James Harden.  So I mean I dunno if the help you‚Äôre talking about is actually help within the definition of a NBA chip."
"Andrew Wiggins is not that different, his team is just good now.   He was never a bust just didn‚Äôt not meet expectations and still doesn‚Äôt"
"Top 5 by minutes, Lakers 2006:      Kobe   Lamar Odom   Smush Parker   Kwame Brown   Chris Mihm       Top 5 by minutes, Warriors 2021:       Steph Curry   Andrew Wiggins   Draymond Green   Kelly Oubre Jr   James Wiseman            just dropping in for comparison"
"If you don't move a guy demanding a trade, even if you don't like the return, you will simply lose them for nothing in free agency if they are an UFA.  When KD left the Warriors he was going to walk for nothing as an unrestricted free agent, same as he did in OKC.  He just happened to be going to a team with a young star guard looking to land a max contract, one his biggest suitors, the Wolves, didn't have the cap space to offer that ([remember the Wolves gave D'lo a helicopter ride where it was revealed he had signed w/the Warriors?\)] (https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/D-Angelo-Russell-helicopter-ride-Wolves-los-angele-14899527.php)  So the Warriors were able to offer D'lo that max he wanted, facilitated through a KD sign and trade, as the Warriors didn't have the cap space either. The Nets wanted to do right by D'lo and help him get that max and were open to the sign and trade transaction.   KD actually balked and said he wouldn't agree unless a Warriors 1st was included ([Nets hadn't even asked for that and allowed very good protections, top 20, it converted to a 2nd](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-kevin-durant-demanded-warriors-give-nets-first-round-pick)).   I won't write an entire article myself here but ultimately we all know what the final result was. Warriors sent out KD, Iguodala, a lightly protected 2024 1st round pick. They then flip D'lo and ultimately end up with Andrew Wiggins, a pick they used to select Jonathan Kuminga, and they were able to get off of Wanamaker, Spellman and Evans to get out of the tax, delaying their repeater penalty by one year.   There was a lot of luck involved in this, if KD picks the Knicks instead of the Nets the Warriors wouldn't have landed any of that, or if the Wolves weren't feeling pressure to keep KAT happy and bring in one of his best friends to play with him while moving off of Wiggins, the Warriors would be left with a big hole at SF and not have a prospect like Kuminga.    It is way, way better to execute a trade when a star is leaving rather than see them walk for zero return."
I felt weird referring to Kyrie by his first name and Wiggins by his last so I went with Andrew
Is andrew wiggins an all star?
Andrew Wiggins is not an allstar. He puts up 17 points like clockwerk and really good D. Not good enough unfortunately.
"I give some much credit to Steph for how well he's been playing, and Iggy being back. thanks heaps to Jordan Poole and Andrew Wiggins stepping up. Draymond Green gets so much better with more wins and team confidence. it's not a total transformation this team has been shown to be the best. also no one expected 12-2. it's more than just some min contracts and rookie signings"
"It‚Äôs not that Andrew Wiggins doesn‚Äôt try or put in effort, it‚Äôs that he just isn‚Äôt good enough to be a star, and never will be"
"Curry is at 18,999 currently and will finish near 20k by the end of the year. He averages about 1,700 points per year. You times that by 7. It would take curry at 40 years old 19 years with no injuries in the future to  pass kobe in scoring.... it's not longevity just kobe is a better scorer.   Curry getting subbed out is because his teams are amazing and torch teams collectively. You even said it.. klay dropping 60 in 3 quarters. Curry didn't have that luxury last year... Kobe was scoring 35ppg with Kwame brown not Andrew Wiggins , kelly oubre Jr, draymond green. Kwame brown.  Plus we all know curry is the greatest shooter, but scorer no."
I mean Andrew Wiggins is pretty much the same player he‚Äôs been just on a better team so his role looks better. He didn‚Äôt live up to the hype plain and simple
"The warriors are doing this with Steph on a super max, Klay as dead money, and Andrew fucking Wiggins‚Äô contract. It‚Äôs unreal"
"Damn threw me off for a second, never heard of Wiggins being referred to by Andrew lol"
"Ah, just as expected: the star of tonight‚Äôs game is Andrew Wiggins"
Andrew Wiggins is a significant asset and adds another weapon to the Warriors' offense

Andrew Wiggins will not stand for this slander
Andrew Wiggins has been on a light jog all game absolutely useless on offense and team defense. Yes he stays in front of his man but this dude is such a fraud  Poole is a trash defender  Belly is getting hunted on defense  It‚Äôs amazing how Kuminga and Gary Payton the 2nd of all people are the one backing Curry and draymond
"This is how you know the Lakers hate has gone way over the top, this dude is really saying that he wouldn't trade Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green for Anthony Davis and Lebron James."
"Lakers Trade LeBron James and Anthony Davis, Warriors trade Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green.   This should be a fair trade!"
He‚Äôs just a more confident and inefficient  Andrew Wiggins

Seth Curry has gotten nice and Andrew Wiggins too
That happens a decent amount for high end high school prospects. I know Andrew Wiggins definitely did it and I think Thon Maker did too?

"Nah I'm pretty sure we're that good. A lot of things went wrong for us to lose tonight. We just aren't going to have many nights this year where Andrew Wiggins is the only player who can make 3's at a decent clip. If anyone else had got going we would have won this game pretty handily. I'm calling a double digit comeback win against the Nets.  sidenote: while I have complete faith in this team, I'm also fully ready to look like an idiot for this comment in a couple days/weeks/months."
andrew wiggins was the warriors‚Äô super idol today

Andrew Wiggins wouldn't watch Gladiator with KG
"""Hornets forgot alllll about Andrew Wiggins""      I think a lot of teams did, tbh."
Curry's 2nd best scorer was Andrew Wiggins. Westbrook had Beal who was #2 in the league in scoring... behind Curry.
Wow beat me to it. Andrew Wiggins also comes to mind
"I don't see ""Traded DeAngelo Russell for Andrew Wiggins + lottery pick"" here."
"Nice try I see your username, Andrew Wiggins"
Warriors's clown bonehead is Andrew Wiggins. Lakers is Westbrook.  I hate Andrew Wiggins with passion but he's playing and buyer into the gsw system and is solid
Andrew Wiggins with the casual 15 pts a game but likely the X factor for this team.  Occasionally he also goes off and 5G Wiggins is unleashed when required.
https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Joe-Lacob-Andrew-wiggins-d-angelo-russell-trade-16613760.php
"Well I dunno, the Warriors drafted most their talent so it adds to that ongoing feeling, like the players love and care for the team they play for. Our most ‚Äúorganic‚Äù winning team would be our first against the Cavs. Quite a feeling! We felt like underdogs but came out on top. Since then they‚Äôve kinda just played franchise mode fighting to stay on top, until we ‚Äúcheated‚Äù signing one player. It‚Äôs a move every other team would have jumped on, but because we did it and we happened to keep our talent through the years, it makes us evil. And it‚Äôs not like we win every finals either.  I feel like the Warriors bring the best out of a lot of players, wether it‚Äôs Javale McGee or Andrew Wiggins and hearing Javale talk about his experience with the Warriors in retrospect was a huge revelation to me and how the franchise treats its players. Plus, the Bay Area can be annoyingly loud about our pride for our sports lol so it might drive other teams‚Äô hatred towards us. Plus the Warriors play pretty uniquely from every other team in the NBA. It‚Äôs fun to see, and the players are actually smiling and having fun too. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs a little ball game that grown men play and make money from"
Who knew Andrew fucking Wiggins was the X factor
I'm Andrew Wiggins?
Wolves fans are just embarrassing themselves. This guy acts like all of last year didn‚Äôt happen. Andrew Wiggins has completely turned his career around while dlo has regressed and become irrelevant just like everyone else who goes to Minnesota to die. Poverty franchise.
Lol with the gaslighting. Andrew Wiggins has become one of the better 3 and D players on the warriors after being labeled and inefficient chucker on Minnesota. Meanwhile dlo has regressed from his time in bkn. Why are u acting like this is some short sample size. We saw this all of last year.
"Not really okay with the header. However, GSW got Andrew Wiggins who doesnt get injured a lot compared to D'Lo for most part in his T'Wolves was sidelined."
Final verdict after one of his 3 big games a year?  Just happened to be vs Wolves‚Ä¶ was 5-15 without a 3 point make with 15 points his next game.  The Andrew Wiggins experience‚Ä¶
"Andrew Wiggins has been playing with intensity these last 2 games, I liked the way he attacked on offense tonight even if he wasn't making some of the shots."

"I hear you. But, this reaction just adds to the soft persona that Wigs already has. They are humans... That get paid millions upon millions of dollars. Andrew Wiggins has been a horrible return of investment."
I have zero love for andrew wiggins
"I fully expect to see a thoughtful essay about this incident, written by Andrew Wiggins."
"Exactly fucking right.  Revenge Game?  Revenge for what?!?  Giving him every opportunity, all the support, and even a SUPERMAX?!?  All on his word?  After looking him in the eye?  Fuck this fucking bitch.  Real easy to enjoy Basketball when you living in the shadow of a great player, on a team with a winning culture, and no fucking pressure whatsoever.  Fuck Andrew Wiggins."
andrew wiggins has had ONE season in minnesota where he averaged more then 2.5 assists a game
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  Players on Golden State hate Klay Thompson.  The first question to ask: why? Why do they all hate him? The obvious answer: forgot about him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most them were around 14 or 15 years old. That means they only got into NBA basketball in the last couple years. So they never watched The Toaster in his prime.  And because they didn't watch him in his prime, they try to compensate for that by ignoring stat sheets and box scores. But here's the thing: basketball is played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""playing time"" or ""health"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Klay's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that the team is congratulating Andrew Wiggins over Klay, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Klay in his prime wouldn't do that. Unlike GSW players, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Klay is better.  They might be jealous of Klay's 3 rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest spot-up shooter in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Warriors fan who watched basketball in the 2010s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This team would make you think that Klay isn't even a top 75 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Steph Curry The Best Player in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Klay talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Yeah there‚Äôs a reason that KD is KD and Andrew Wiggins is Andrew Wiggins. KD is the exception not the norm, if Wiggins and other top tier athletes were able to make things work with long ass arms like KD does then KD wouldn‚Äôt be an all time great, making it work is what makes him special."
Andrew 'the stilt' wiggins
"&gt; James Harden has not been superstar help  Oh he'll be one give it a few games. You can't be deadass serious believing that the whole season. I know the tweet saying ""Harden will be a rule change away from being Andrew Wiggins"" is looking to come true but with his talent, there's no way that doesn't happen.   &gt; Draymond should be an all star this year  After people really believing he's a triple single scrub, now all of a sudden he's an all star? Draymond is the most schrodinger's all star ever. People just wishy washy declare scrub/all star in order to fit their narrative."

Classic Wiggins games against teams that traded him (Minnesota and Cleveland) and in Toronto (in his country).  The guy is just not built to bring that kind of energy and offensive focus every night. He's just not built for being a good first option every night.   But he is a great asset for the Warriors cause he deliver an average / good job every night and can always have a great playoffs game when opposite teams dont wait for it. Imagine if the Warriors Can get a game 4 Andrew before the game 6 Klay.
"Andrew Wiggins whooped KAT‚Äôs candy ass tonight, wow"
"Andrew Wiggins woke, sniffed the air and said to himself. Not 16. Not 17.  Not 19.   Not today."
Andrew wiggins couldn't win with this KAT
"&gt; The price he cost the warriors tho was the ability to stay above the cap.   Yes. But wouldn't you factor that in with these players and their value? Even if it was just a max slot and Wiggins couldn't even play, he would still be providing that value to the Warriors. Everyone is deciding his value is what he would get as a free agent. And that's not the only way these contracts work. Andrew Wiggins holds a Max slot for the Warriors and they wanted that slot and Wiggins. So that's exactly what his value is.   &gt;If the warriors felt he was worth 30mil they wouldn‚Äôt have demanded a pick back with the DLo trade.   They demanded the pick because they knew the Timberwolves were desperate to get D-Lo to keep KAT happy. Again, these players have value that goes beyond how well they play. There's not a Warriors fan that thinks D-Lo would have been better for us than Wiggins so that pick was pure gravy. We should have done it straight up. Wiggins is the better player for us."
"Draymond would fit well with a lot of teams though. Not as good as the Warriors, but he‚Äôd fit. Wiggins may fit nearly any team playstyle wise because of his profile, but if you find Dray a team he does fit on, the ceiling on that team is much higher than adding Wiggins. Off the top of my head, the Bulls, TWolves, Nets, Clippers, and Blazers are playoff aspiring teams Dray would fit well with. And Wiggins wouldn‚Äôt fit some teams too tbh. Take the Clippers, Bulls, or even the Heat. Fully healthy, they‚Äôre not going to pay Andrew Wiggins 25 mil a year to come off the bench unless he‚Äôs willing to play the 4 full time."
"If anyone knows what winning looks like, it‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins."
"So, Andrew Wiggins with slightly better defense?  That‚Äôs a max guy"
I don‚Äôt remember anyone saying Embiid would be out of the league. Some were questioning if he should go first overall because he had a more impressive season than Kansas teammate Andrew Wiggins. There were injury concerns but people knew he could play
"He's a consistent dude, you usually know what youre going to get with him. He had his best season with GSW though, so hopefully his efficiency improves  https://www.hoopdx.com/players/4358-andrew-wiggins"
"You‚Äôve done everything but call him by his actual name(aka what everyone calls him), which you clearly know. It‚Äôs really just kind of disrespectful at this point that you don‚Äôt just call him ‚ÄúWiggins‚Äù or ‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins.‚Äù"
Devin and Trae have a lot more ball handling duties and are more closely guarded than Wiggins again stop looking at purely bbref and watch Andrew play.
"* https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=andrew+wiggins+efg%25%2C+ts%25+by+season * https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/ts-percentage?rate=per-game  He was 2 percent away from Trae Young last year and would be in the top 250 of all time out of 4,509 players if he retired today in TS$."
"For those who don't remember the expectations Wiggins had:  [Kobe Bryant passes the torch to Andrew Wiggins, just as Michael Jordan did to him](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/02/kobe-bryant-andrew-wiggins-michael-jordan-same-moves-video)"
it seems like he's the second option for SF after ariza (who is currently injured).  that's a decent role even if ariza were healthy because they're probably going to manage most of the older guys' minutes anyway.  if he were in gsw still he'd maybe be 3rd option at best.  and the first option at SF is andrew wiggins who might never miss a game all season.
"Drummond never worked on improving his scoring, Simmons never worked on his shooting. This isn't an Andrew Wiggins situation where he was steadily improving in everything until he got paid. And even then, the improvement was never promising enough to justify maxing him. It's the GM's job to be smart about those things, not the independent contractor's job to go out of his way to do extra for his employer."
I was excited for it too until I noticed that Andrew Wiggins didn't like to dunk.
"Adding rookies and presumably wiseman makes your team worse not better (short term). People need to pump the breaks on the Warriors. Curry is great, but your asking him to carry a Klay who just returned from two serious injuries, Draymond who will give you 0 points in a big game and nobody will be surprised, rookies and sophmores who still need time to to develop, and Andrew Wiggins.   They arent winning shit lol."
I remember back when he and Andrew Wiggins were supposed to be generational talents.
"I hate the narrative that it's his fault the team is bad. What, he's supposed to carry treveon graham jeff teague andrew wiggins jarrett culver and josh okogie to the playoffs? In what universe? Its a team sport and when he finally gets a modicum of help he's ""carried"""
"I‚Äôm sorry our 4th best player was either Carmelo Anthony or Trevor Ariza and youre laughing at Oubre? Ooookayy bud, whatever you say   Not to mention our 3rd best was Hassan whiteside compared to Andrew Wiggins."
Give me a break.   Dame made the playoffs the year before when our 5 highest minute players were:  Dame  Cj  Hassan whiteside  Carmelo Anthony   anfernee simons  Mario hezonja played the 8th most minutes for us. He‚Äôs about the 10th best player and you‚Äôre telling me the BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD can‚Äôt make it with draymond Andrew Wiggins and Oubre?   Nahhhh
How Andrew Wiggins made 40% on 3s last year is beyond me. It doesn't look good even when it goes in.
Correct! Which is why mandates (EDIT: and inconveniences) work.   The San Francisco Bay Area is all-in on mandating vaccines and it's working in all industries ‚Äî as Andrew Wiggins found out.
"no disagreement on that here.  but nba players for the most part don't like being told what to do and don't like telling each other what to do, which is why a league that is now 95% vaccinated (some begrudgingly, but 27 teams aren't subject to mandates so the vast majority aren't actually forced to get it if they want to play) refused to sign on to a league-wide mandate for players to get vaccinated.  even steph curry, who held info sessions with dr fauci on covid-19, and who is on one of those 3 teams affected by mandates and thus obviously would have his season jeopardized if one of their most reliable starters were to miss half of their games, was like ""well i hope he will but it's up to him"" before andrew wiggins got vaccinated."
"It was 100% the money.   &gt; It came down to get the vaccination or don't play basketball. I'm 26. I have two kids. I want more kids. I'm trying to do something that will generate as much money as I can for my kids and my future kids, trying to make generational wealth.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-andrew-wiggins-feels-like-he-was-kind-of-forced-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-to-play-in-nba/  I doubt Andrew cares that much about the media. If you're not constantly vocal about it you fade into the background.. people are talking about Kyrie, Beal and MPJ not as much."

"Warriors are definitely making the play-in, maybe the playoffs, but they‚Äôre not going past the first round.  Stephen Curry has shown he is incapable of spearheading a contender without a stacked roster at his side. Zero clutch gene. Couldnt win a single play-in game and got outplayed by Ja Morant lmaoo  He had triple-single Draymond Green who everyone raves about being one of the most ‚Äúimpactful‚Äù players in the league and a 20 PPG bucket in Andrew ‚ÄúGotta do my own Research‚Äù Wiggins and he still missed the playoffs‚Ä¶.  And this is fresh of a 2020 campaign where he faked an injury (IMO) to sit out the season and the Warriors ended with the worst record in the NBA. He didn‚Äôt want to play and have the Warriors miss the playoffs and everyone point to that and say ‚Äúhaha KD carried you, now you a lottery bum‚Äù   His G5-G7 of 2016 cemented him as the most phenomenal choker in NBA history. Only more chokes to come! Imagine winning a scoring title and missing the playoffs. That‚Äôs some Allen Iverson stuff right there. Now I know why Curry looked up to AI lmao  Also it‚Äôs so funny when people act like Warriors made any improvements. Your two rookies are going to be low-impact. Wiseman isn‚Äôt taking any jump, hes terrible. Iggy is washed. Klay hasnt played basketball since like Obama was president‚Ä¶But Wilt Chamberlain Jr is somehow going to help propel you guys to contending? Lmao  Warriors 42-40, 9th seed, Miss the playoffs via play-in choke"
Kyrie irving dum dum dum. Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.  Andrew Wiggins smart smart smart. Smart smart smart smart smart.
"So, there is something called a Collective Bargaining Agreement (""CBA"") between the players (National Basketball Players' Association) and the NBA.    Because of the CBA, the NBA doesn't actually have the power to just ""do a league wide vaccine mandate"".  The league can make it so that workers, refs, camera men, coaches, front office staff, etc., all have to be vaccinated.  But for a vaccine mandate for the players, the NBPA would have to agree to it, and they have already said they will not agree to it.  That is why the league has added rules that appear to make no logical sense - like why an unvaccinated player can play in a game with the team, but can't go out to dinner with vaccinated players.  It's really less about stopping the spread and more about making things difficult for unvaccinated players to incentivize them to get vaccinated, because again, the CBA prevents the NBA from simply mandating it.  If you're wondering why Andrew Wiggins needed to get vaccinated, or why Kyrie is away from the Nets - that is because San Francisco and NYC, respectively, have  instituted vaccine mandates for employees in their cities.  While the CBA gives the NBPA power to say no to the NBA, NBA players still have to follow local laws."
"I can‚Äôt believe someone typed that list of names and didn‚Äôt realize they were making the opposite point than they were trying to. Terrell Brandon, Wally and Joe Smith? In 15 years people are going to say the same about KAT lol. You‚Äôre telling me he won nothing with Deangelo Russell, Jeff Teague, Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Crawford, Dario Saric and Taj Gibson? Had to be a bum."
Carrots and sticks. Carrots. And. Sticks.  This thread is about fucking whacko Kyrie Irving ... but garden-variety lazy/stubborn Andrew Wiggins went and got the fucking jab when his job was on the line.  FWIW my state implemented a lottery that you enter automatically by getting the vaccine and apparently that was enough to change some people's minds in the early days lol
Andrew Wiggins looking like a damn genius compared to Kyrie.
"John Wall, Andrew Wiggins, D-Lo, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie, Kristaps, Kevin Love...  It might be more rare to get dramatically better after getting a max contract than it is to stay exactly the same (or worse, due to injury, lack of motivation, or age-related decline)."

"Genuinely cope. You can't take valid criticism about your ""best young talent"" even though his ceiling is Andrew Wiggins. Never seen such a mid player defended this much"
Cleveland Cavaliers legend Andrew Wiggins
So Andrew Wiggins?
"Pretty much. The can‚Äôt miss guys are usually the exception but for the rest of the guys its pretty much true. Andrew Wiggins or Jabari Parker are pretty decent examples of this. It takes a lot of luck, skill and insane work ethic to become a good NBA player."
I wonder what MJ would do if Kyrie or Andrew Wiggins were on the Hornets.
He‚Äôs going to develop Andrew Wiggins syndrome soon
I had season tickets during Jimmy Butlers first season in Minnesota so there was a season ticket holders party at the science museum in St. Paul where we could get pictures with the players and I snuck in a quick chat.  Jamal Crawford didn't seem impressed when I told him he was the only Wolves jersey I owned outside of KG. Andrew Wiggins smiled and laughed when I said his dog was my favorite on the team and Jimmy Butler was nice enough to stay late to make sure everyone got a picture (tbf he showed up late) but he didn't have a lot to say.
I was told by multiple people I was crazy for taking this man over Andrew Wiggins in fantasy smh we will have to see
"1-5 injury prone, andrew wiggins injury flopping, who is kent bazemore again?"
"Tobias Harris, Andrew Wiggins"
Andrew wiggins .  Played like shit in the 2018 playoffs and played like shit in the play in tourney this past year
The bench has some pretty decent defensive utility especially Marcus smart. Andrew Wiggins has some tools to be an elite wing defender as well. But I would agree the starting lineup has too many defensive liabilities
"John Wall, Kevin love, deangelo Russell, Andrew wiggins, Ben Simmons, kristaps porzingis... you taking all these guys over BI ?"
"The Warriors had the same problem with Andrew Wiggins, and they got him to take the vaccine.  (Note:  Wiggins survived taking the vaccine.  At least as I write this, he hasn't died yet.)  Maybe Irving is even more brain-damaged than Wiggins, but the Nets should talk to the Warriors about how to get it done."
"Who besides Kyrie has proclaimed to be ""woke"" before the vaccine?  You're gloating like Jonathan Isaac, one of the few vocal anti-vaxxers in the league, wasn't refusing to kneel or like Andrew Wiggins has been a vocal proponent for social causes.  Don't bother to answer, you showed your true colors calling the concept that black people shouldn't be killed by cops crap and nonsense.  Your opinion, much like your character, is literal garbage."
After what I heard from Andrew Wiggins getting screwed by clutch sports and I think Rich Paul was the agent involved I just want to say to all at clutch FUCK CLUTCH AND RICH PAUL. For those of you who don't know about this story Wiggins came out and said I believe it's Rich Paul and clutch sports screwed him for $100 million contract I believe from Denver because the agent/rich Paul told him not to sign the contract that he could get better and after he did not sign that hundred million dollar contract clutch/rich Paul did not do anything for Andrew Wiggins and Andrew Wiggins came out and said that they only CARE ABOUT THE TOP TIER PLAYERS THAT THEY HAVE AND WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER PLAYERS THEY DO NOT TREAT THEM THE SAME AND BASICALLY DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THEM. To be honest I actually believe this guy and if it is true I hope Wiggins wins his lawsuit and the truth he told.
"Jonathan Isaac, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Andrew Wiggins, ... yeah you get the idea"
endless top 3 picks? The cavs last top 3 pick was andrew wiggins in 2014. And that year i think they had like a sub 2% chance of winning the lottery. Weird hearing raptor fans diss the cavs like they are some sort of storied franchise or some bullshit. Raps are just another middling franchise just like the cavs whether they wanna hear it or not.
Based on state mandates iirc. So New York and California. Might be missing some but the stories I hear about (this and Andrew Wiggins) are because of state mandates
"Coming from a fan of the team that been good for 7 seasons in 50 years lolol and y‚Äôall have the record for most number one picks and still the worst drafting success of any team. In 8 years you had 7 lottery picks and 3 of them are number 1 picks. Drafted Bennett, Tristan Thompson, Andrew Wiggins, passed on Embiid, Kawhi, Giannis, Lavine. The most remarkable thing your teams has done is the [great comeback](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1588411/).  At some point self awareness is supposed to stop you from making a fool of yourself. But go off."
No... I'm not Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins
"Would the Nets take an Andrew Wiggins for Kyrie? I would think so. The Warriors wouldn't want to give him, but could you imagine a world in which a team like the Timberwolves when they had him would give him up for cap space? /r/nba would recommend we do that given the opportunity"
Same here but with Andrew Wiggins. Had some mutual friends I'd drive down with to watch him in Vaughan. Makes the recent stuff more disappointing lmao
"It's the difference between a Jerry West and your regular scout. Like when he was on the Lakers draft team, the team knew they were going to do whatever they could to get Kobe and then build around him because they saw a budding superstar. (At least according to the 1996 draft doc.) And that was all Jerry.  The guard position is more saturated than 'the special mobile 7-footer' position, so those guys tend to go later but spark later on a team: Jamal, Donovan, Booker, SGA, you name it.  Most of the time people grade off of freak athletic ceilings like Andrew Wiggins or De'Andre Ayton, Anthony Edwards because they like the possibility of what they can become.  West seems like one of those rare good eyes who is like ""why wouldn't I take the prodigy?"" and sees the mental/skill ceiling."
I should‚Äôve used someone else like andrew Wiggins vs a more skilled guy. My whole point is a guy isn‚Äôt automatically a better pick because he‚Äôs more physically gifted
I should‚Äôve used someone else like andrew Wiggins vs a more skilled guy. My whole point is a guy isn‚Äôt automatically a better pick because he‚Äôs more physically gifted
thank you Andrew Wiggins for not relying on crooked politicians to bail you out of poor decisions when all you needed to do was get the shot. Thank you. The best ability is Availability....that and running like a 4.0 flat 40 time
\#22 Andrew Wiggins **might** *might* show up for next game üëÄ
"But the way you phrased it - once Klay comes back and Andrew Wiggins is back, implies Wiggins is not *here*."
He's improved so much since his rookie year. I'm really interested to see how he gets touches once allay comes back and Andrew Wiggins is back (with the vac)
"I think someone no ones talking about is that there‚Äôs a chance the mandates in these large cities could be reversed in ~6 months if the infection rate drops significantly and the overall vaccination rate increases. This means Kyrie would be allowed to play all the games in the playoffs. Otherwise, Kyrie will just probably wait it out last minute and do what Andrew Wiggins did."
"In this case, advocating for the vaccine isn't really performative. The Black community has a lot of vaccine hesitancy and people like Jordan advocating for it can have a real, tangible impact. That is essentially what Kareem said in [this article](https://kareem.substack.com/p/while-andrew-wiggins-whines-black), though in this specific case he was talking about Wiggins being vocally anti-vax."
"What exactly is Simmons' perceived value? For reference, here are 3 offers that other GMs rejected from Morey:  1. OG Anunoby, Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, 4th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft  2. Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft, and 2 future first round picks  3. CJ, three first round picks, and three swaps  I'm not entirely sure what dangerous precedent is hanging in the balance here but it seems that other GMs cant see eye to eye with Morey's perception of Simmons' perceived value."
We believe  That Andrew Wiggins is an idiot get over it
"If Andrew Wiggins is ""your guy"", that says all we need to know about you."
Cuz his decision to not get the vaccine has far greater implications than the other players making the same choice. That's why Andrew Wiggins was getting so much heat until he gave in and got the shot. If DC instituted a mandate similar to New York or SF I promise you Beal would come under substantially more criticism over night.
"Calling Andrew Wiggins and Draymond fringe G-leaguers because you‚Äôre so in love with Curry.. Wiggins is just a touch below all-star and Draymond is one of the best defenders in the league while being an elite passer. They‚Äôre both great players. Harden, Lebron, Luka, KD, Kawhi would have carried that team to the playoffs tbh.   Notice they didn‚Äôt even make the playoffs without Klay? Well that should tell u Curry needs him for his elite wing defense and shooting. Your comparison with Harden makes no sense since Harden is a solo talent while Curry is a system player that greatly benefits from having Draymond facilitate, allowing him to constantly move off the ball. You can‚Äôt just plop him on any team and expect the same production, he needs to join a team that has a point forward/center. Curry would be great on any team but you‚Äôre delusional if you don‚Äôt think playing alongside Draymond and Klay is the perfect situation for him."
Not just any number 1 pick. Andrew Wiggins was the highest rated prospect since Lebron.
Andrew Wiggins
"Andrew Wiggins ROTY. Some of the reasoning was absurd at the time, like using defense as a positive, even though followers of the league knew he was extremely terrible and easily worse than Mirotic. Some of them look dumb in retrospect, like saying Wiggins should win because he‚Äôd be a star someday."
"Dog.   Where did I EVER put words in your mouth? Where did I say anything that you're accusing me of saying?   You're the one that brought up OTHERS getting vaccinated, besides Andrew Wiggins.   My original comment was in response to someone saying that Andrew wouldn't take kindly to being called out like this. You're the one that did... whatever this is."
Andrew Wiggins (DNP) (3rd degree burns from Kareem)
Andrew Wiggins is responsible for the suffering of black people? I knew that boy was no good
"I'm looking to trade for Jarrett Allen but it could sacrifice Andrew Wiggins and I'm not sure if its worth it. Like JA raises our ceiling but Wiggs could come crucial in the playoffs because the Western Conference is wings heavy and we need Kawhi stoppers, LeBron stoppers."
"Maybe but Andrew Wiggins and Kyrie Irving (and other anti vax NBA players) didn‚Äôt struggle like that. They‚Äôre selfish, rich, spoiled, idiots, plain and simple. They are so far separated from the reality of Covid decimating black communities especially and yet they continue to spread misinformation. Being reluctant to take the vaccine is one thing but the lies they spread is what makes them truly damaging."
"makes sense, thank you! i‚Äôm vaxxed too! was jus curious because of the whole kyrie and andrew wiggins shit"
"&gt; Today, while Andrew Wiggins was gathering his generational wealth, 2,036 people died of COVID-19 and 71,905 new cases were confirmed. Of these deaths and new cases, 97 percent of them were unvaccinated. Tomorrow and the day after and the day after, more will die and others will face long-term health problems. He could help prevent that. He chose to use his body not to.  Well, sure, when you put it like *that*...  Kareem did not miss him"
"When you have the platform that Andrew Wiggins does, there is a certain responsibility that one holds. That would include not spreading misinformation about a global pandemic where over 700,000 people have died."
Andrew Wiggins ain't black. He's Canadian /s

"Kareem is right to criticize Wiggins for the reason why he did it, but it's kind of weird that he goes at it from a segregated Americanized vision of things to criticized a Canadian about his motivation, like he could've gone at it just from the human perspective of having to protect people and that fans look might look at Andrew as an example so he should do the right thing, but instead he start by saying ""He's not wrong in being concerned about generational wealth because the    U.S. has historically made it more difficult for Black families to    accrue wealth that they can pass along to other generations to give them    some of the advantages that white people have.""  Then say:""Instead of stepping up to encourage those in the Black community who may    be taking their vaccine hesitancy cue from him to get the vaccine and    save their lives, he issues vague statements that have no meaning but    may have seriously damaging impact""  What does it have to do with the black community and just not everyone?"
"&gt;	Today, while Andrew Wiggins was gathering his generational wealth, 2,036 people died of COVID-19 and 71,905 new cases were confirmed.

He could help prevent that. He chose to use his body not to.  Powerful and poetic. Fuck all the people who chose not to get vaccinated. Every single COVID-related code that I‚Äôve been involved with in the ICU involved unvaccinated patients. But, of course, Cole Beasley and others like him are skeptical about what happens in the ICU. If a tree falls in the forest, but you‚Äôre not there to witness it, does it make a noise? Yes, yes it does."
"If Andrew Wiggins doesn't want people to call him an idiot, perhaps he should stop saying idiotic things."
"Lemme guess, it‚Äôs all Andrew Wiggins fault. I get this is an important issue and Wiggins was wrong but when you make dumb comparisons like this you take away from the bigger issues"
"&gt; (...) his family‚Äôs generational wealth, which at his salary of about $29.54 million a year, is in no real danger. That excuse doesn‚Äôt really hold up. Especially when he‚Äôs clearly choosing money for him and his family over the health and lives of other families not as fortunate as him.

The right to do whatever you want with your body doesn‚Äôt exist in pretty much any civilized society because we recognize that those who behave recklessly and irresponsibly can harm others. You do own your body‚Äîunless a deadly virus turns that body into a plague delivery system that can kill hundreds of thousands. Today, while Andrew Wiggins was gathering his generational wealth, 2,036 people died of COVID-19 and 71,905 new cases were confirmed.

He could help prevent that. He chose to use his body not to."
"If the medium, or the way you're addressed hurts you more than the message itself, then that's on you.   Andrew Wiggins has been a little bitch for years now and squandered an opportunity that some would literally die for. Divas like him can just get over themselves."
Another one I thought of:  Lonzo Ball  CJ McCollum   Andrew Wiggins   Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid
lol yea Kareem really felt the need to feel superior to Andrew Wiggins or maybe he felt the need to speak out against a millionaire athlete who got the vaccine and then acted like he was a victim who was forced by the greater establishment to get the vaccine.  But naw must be Kareem feeling insecure about himself and wanting to establish superiority over Wiggins.
"I agree with everything Kaj see here. A guy like Wiggins, though, if this hits his radar, would say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs kewl he has an opinion‚Äù and think nothing more. Andrew Wiggins is a lot of things, but I don‚Äôt think pondering the pros and cons of vaccinations is in his wheelhouse. And some people just don‚Äôt enjoy thinking."
"Kobmug understands the point, hes not an idiot, hes a smart guy. He understands that Andrew wiggins is not Joe Blow , and that it matters what people with a platform say.  But he will defend even the most idiotic of these anti-covid vax people.  And will never say a negative word about them.  Must protect them at all costs"
"Derrick Rose is the obvious answer. I'd say his playstyle was very susceptible to injuries from early on, so there's not too much of a point in playing the what-if game with him. Grant Hill was the obvious one before Rose, although maybe he got in for his college career?  In terms of guys just not panning out and not so much because of injuries, but more so because they never reached that higher level - Ricky Rubio and Andrew Wiggins."
"Cap police is here... We have a warrant for your arrest, too much capping...  Curry has just finished a season in which he scored 44 pts per 100 (would rank #2 in volume among ALL Jordan seasons, only behind 1987) on +9 rTS%...   Its a shame that his team was so overwhelmingly talented on offense, tho... I mean Klay was... wait... Klay didn't play a single minute all year? Really? What about Durant? Oh, he left a while ago. Iggy too? Well they still had absolute offensive juggernauts such as Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre Jr., Paschall...  Curry completely estroyed plebs like you this year, who were harping for years about how he was only able to score because of Klay and a great overall roster...  His roster this past year was pure trash, arguably as bad as MJ pre Pippen and Gran, and  he posted 44 pts (per 100) on +9 rTS%... MJ probably peaked as a regular season scorer with 43.5 pts (per 100) on 6.5-7 rTS%... Still insane numbers, but saying Curry doesn't deserve to be in this tier as a scorer is false."
"Andrew Wiggins had so much hype. My math teacher in high-school coached our HS team and actually coached against him. I remember the dudes in my class gathering around asking him what it was like and all, it was crazy.   Considering that he never suffered a damning injury, I'd have to say him"
"The problem is deeper than his shot and that passed up dunk in Game 7 is proof. Mentally speaking, he‚Äôs more similar to Andrew Wiggins than Lebron. Wiggins is good, but with a better work ethic through the years could be so much better"
"Ben Simmons, yes he's a hugely flawed player offensively, yes he has a horrible attitude and character issues. But some of these takes about him on this sub and on social media have been ridiculous, I've heard people call him a net negative or that he should be out of the league. I've heard people say that they'd rather have Andrew Wiggins over him. I've heard some people on the Raptors sub say that it would be a disappointment if Scottie Barnes ended up as good as Simmons.  Like you guys realize he's made 3 all star games, 2 all defensive teams, and is a worthy contender for DPOY right?"
It's not obvious. Andrew Wiggins mom is an Olympic medalist on track and field. Sonya Curry ü•µ played volleyball in college.
Andrew Wiggins is very good at basketball

"&gt; This is a world where Andrew Wiggins, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are making about what he's making. Nobody sane would give up KP for any of those guys.  Wiggins I get and CJ I could sort of be talked into, but are you really suggesting there‚Äôs a world where David Griffin could offer Brandon Ingram for KP straight up and the Mavs would say *no*?  We‚Äôre talking about the same KP who looks like he can barely move his knee anymore, right?"
"You have to be a nephew to think KP has no value. This is a world where Andrew Wiggins, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are making about what he's making.  Nobody sane would give up KP for any of those guys.  Let's not even get into about 10 guy that have straight toxic deals like John Wall, Tobias Harris, (formerly) Kemba or Simmons.  THJ, especially on the new deal, and Kleber have more value than DFS."
"Sorry, you're completely wrong. Steve Kerr said it himself, unless you think you know better than him.  &gt; ""You're gonna guard LeBron, you're gonna guard Kawhi, you're gonna guard Luka. We don't have other guys on the roster who can do that so that's your job. Here's what you need to do to do that and we're gonna stay on you.' That plan was executed.

The best part of this move is the leadership and coaching that‚Äôs going to be provided to Andrew Wiggins. He started locking down players like Iggy and is better offensively.  Hope he learns some tricks from him.
"I honestly get your points and agree somewhat on a lot of them, but this definitely reads like someone that has had to deal with Karl Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins as their franchise stars lol"
"I agree with not everyone thriving in the system, but it isn't due to character or drive issues. Everyone has different ways of handling criticism and different motivations.  IMO, someone who is in the DPOY conversation is inherently driven. Offense is all the glamour and defense just isn't. Imagine a world where Simmons is T5 in the league in scoring and a turnstile on defense, I doubt this narrative is being strewn about. It's just hard to sum all of what Simmons does defensively.  I get that not everyone in the NBA has aspirations to be the GOAT when their career is all said and done, I've seen a player like Andrew Wiggins wander through the early stages of his career. But I don't think that is Simmons, personally. The dynamic between him and the organization, between him and Embiid, has just become so extreme he needs a change of scenery. Not everyone thrives under as much pressure as the 6ers org has been under these last few years, it isn't a drive thing."
Andrew wiggins
"ATL - Dominque Wilkins Boston - Larry Bird Brooklyn - KD Charlotte - Rex Chapman  Chicago - Jordan  Cleveland - Mark Price Dallas - Dirk Denver - Melo Detroit - Isiah Thomas GSW - Chris Mullin Houston - Hakeem Indiana - Reggie Miller LAC - Sam Cassell LAL - Kareem Memphis - Jason Williams Miami - Glen Rice Milwaukee - Giannis Minnesota - Andrew Wiggins New Orleans - Zion New York - Patrick Ewing OKC - Harden Orlando - Shaq Philly - Barkley Phoenix - Cedric Ceballos Portland - Damian Lillard Sacramento - Peja Stojakovic San Antonio - David Robinson Toronto - Damon Stoudamire Utah - John Stockton  Washington - Moses Malone  This was fun. Some guys popped in my head from playing NBA Jam, and others from dunk contests."
"Also, just to add onto this, 'at this point in his career' is a ridiculous thing to say, honestly. He just came off of a season where he averaged 32 points per game, the most in his career, and you make it sound like he can't even lead a team anymore. He's still as good as he was before, and his game's gonna age very well. The issue was that his entire team was hobbled and he had to play with a pretty shabby cast outside of Kelly Oubre Jr., Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green. The first two players are just average to slightly above average starters.   I dunno, reading your comments just feels like those weird LeBron haters that just overexaggerate his flaws and treat them like they're more prominent than the pros."
Just like Andrew Wiggins
For a majority of KAT's career his 2nd best teammate was Andrew Wiggins. Steph Curry just had an MVP caliber season and dragged Wiggins to the 9th seed.   If mvp level Steph can't do it then what's KAT suppose to do?
"honestly I admire how much Warriors fans actually love the Warriors players  you guys have really convinced yourself Andrew Wiggins is indispensable, I admire this"
"The Warriors have invested a lot of time in Andrew Wiggins and have helped build him up into a solid 2-way player. Maybe he's not playing up to that giant contract, but he'll be a really good third scoring option if Klay comes back healthy. He's also been durable so far. He led the team in minutes played last year, and he's only 15 months older than Simmons, so there really isn't a major youth play either. I think I'd rather have Wiggins than Simmons at this exact moment in time."
Andrew Wiggins looks like Mr Meseeks. So does Vance Joseph
I think I'd rather have Andrew Wiggins. He fits in with the team.
Y‚Äôall are delusional if you think Andrew Wiggins is going to contribute more to your willing than Ben
"It's basically Wiggins, Wiseman and Kuminga for Ben. It's a lot less than the rumored Morey asking price of  James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, 2021 draft picks No. 7 /No. 14 and two future first-round picks."
Winning a championship means never having to say your sorry. Do the Cavs regret giving up Andrew Wiggins or the Raptors regret giving up Jakob Poetel or the Bucks regret giving up 4 first round picks or the Lakers regret giving up their entire team and all those picks?

"Guys who are still making more than Randle after this extension:  DeAngelo Russel, Kevin Love, Porzingis, Andrew Wiggins, John Wall, Jrue Holiday, Rudy Gobert"
He going to the warriors it shouldn‚Äôt take him this long to sign this contract the Lakers stacked and he won‚Äôt win with the Clippers he‚Äôs on the move again   STEPH KLAY KAWHI DRAYMOND  BEJELICA   KAWHI  FOR  JAMES WISEMAN  ANDREW WIGGINS  And a second round pick
"klove wasn't some top 10 player but he was definitely an all star/3rd team all nba talent now cmon. just because you have a raging hardon for bron doesn't mean kevin love was ass  the cavs literally traded andrew wiggins for him to give lebron a 3rd piece  and yes, lebron relegates his teammates to very basic roles time after time  chris bosh and kevin love filled the same role for bron as gap filler big men. they were two of the best bigs in the league when they teamed up with bron and became considerably less than when on their superteams for a reason  there's really nothing to dispute that"
"They can trade Joe Harris for Andrew Wiggins, Golden State gets another excellent floor spacer who's going to get a lot of open 3's just like the KD era and more cap space, Nets get an excellent defender."
Imagine paying repeater tax because of Kelly Oubre and Andrew Wiggins  LMFAO
Got Andrew Wiggins and the Kuminga pick for basically nothing from KD leaving as well.
"They filled the Kevin Durant hole with Andrew Wiggins. There's certainly room left over, but it's not like the hole is wide open. And at the same time they've filled the Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko, Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, and Jacob Evans slots with Wiseman, Porter, Bjelica, Toscano-Anderson, and Poole. The bench has been upgraded. The Iguodala and Livingston holes still need filling, though."
"A meh run franchise attracted Kevin Durant, signed David West well below his market value, found great rotation pieces in guys like Looney, Damion Lee and JTA, drafted Eric Paschall and Jordan Poole well below their true value and turned Andrew Wiggins into a great defender...but yeah I guess they suck"
"Ontario Canada would give them a run:  Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Rick Fox, Jamal Magloure, Sim Bhullar, James Naismith."
"Andrew Wiggins will be a warrior for the next 10 years and will retire with 3 rings and 1 finals MVP. This is after steph/klay/dray retire and Maple Jordan + Poole/Moody/Kuminga/JTA/Wiseman continue the dynasty. Calling it now.   Unrelated but Damion Lee will continue to receive a salary throughout this era from either the Warriors, the Santa Cruz Warriors, or his brother in law directly. That‚Äôs pretty much a guarantee.   Right as that new core is retiring in 15 years a young recruit by the name of Canon Wardell Jack Curry will be drafted by the Warriors and average 21 shots per game from beyond the 4 point line (introduced in the NBA in 2026), thereby carrying the team to yet another series of Championships. Really it‚Äôs all fairly obvious.  So yeah definitely don‚Äôt write Wiggins off yet."
"Canada already produced two first overall picks, Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett"
"Zach played with Andrew Wiggins as a youngster, now he gets to play with Andrew Wiggins‚Äô much more sophisticated and polished older version."
His Jersey number is the same as the last two digits of the year of the next nba finals?? Mark my words this is Andrew Wiggins breakout year.
&gt; more motivated  here comes this brain dead take  what about him screams unmotivated? the dude literally has been the only bright spot on the shittiest team in sports. it's not his fault his 2nd best player was a pissed off jimmy butler for 1 season and his next best player was lazy ass andrew wiggins
The only package we‚Äôd give up siakam for is gsw wiseman and the two 2021 picks with andrew wiggins to match salary
The Andrew Wiggins special
Price tag among other things. It's like people don't remember Gary Harris. Or Andrew Wiggins. Or Otto Porter Jr.
It's like some people don't remember Gary Harris. Or Andrew Wiggins. Or Otto Porter Jr. An overpaid Lonzo just hamstrings us.
"He may not be one in 2026 specifically, but quote me on this: Andrew Wiggins will make at least 1 all-star game in the next 5 years."
Andrew Wiggins - almost 0 improvement
Andrew Wiggins?
"What? They want to win now. The curry window is closing. How are you unaware of your own teams intentions?  Also, Kawhi is worth a million Andrew Wiggins."
"Lol when they had +7 year contracts everyone complained.  A team would sign a player that wasn't worth it to a +7 year max and tank their team for a decade.  Imagine if guys like Kevin Love, Andrew Wiggins, Kemba Walker, and Gordon Hayward signed +7 year max deals."
"Not in The same playing level as those guys but Andrew Wiggins has been an absolute iron man, even endured some seasons with thibs as his coach"
Andrew Wiggins being the anti 13/30 is the least suprising Andrew Wiggins fact to ever Andrew Wiggins.
"I'm pretty sure McGrady wasn't Andrew Wiggins though, lol the injuries just added up and took his athleticism over time. in 02-03 he was as good as any non-big in the league"
And now he doesn‚Äôt have his big hair anymore so he just looks like a small Andrew Wiggins
That was Andrew Wiggins.
coulda been andrew wiggins tho
Andrew Wiggins or Kelly Oubre.
"It depends on how much the offer is. That's the problem. Hell, I'm willing to go 4/80. But I'd rather give up Lonzo than make him the new Gary Harris or Otto Porter Jr. or Andrew Wiggins."
"Lol you really are butthurt if you have to come me with irrelevant shit. Andrew Wiggins isnt your family dude, it‚Äôs ok to point out his flaws, we‚Äôre all on this blue marble together"
Andrew Wiggins is the only legit veteran wing we have. Juan Toscano Anderson can't play starter minutes. Kuminga and Moody are unproven and likely the assets given up in a trade.
"Pascal Siakam is a proven top 3 player on a championship team and someone that led the 2019-2020 Raptors to a top 3 record in the entire league, while making it to the allstar team and allnba. What the hell has Wiggins done? And I say that as someone who has always rooted for Andrew.            They are different levels of players. If Pascal was playing next to Steph and Dray, there is no way they wouldn‚Äôt have made the playoffs. I‚Äôm sure Pascal would have benefited a lot from having Curry take off the offensive pressure (so he doesn‚Äôt have to be the \#1 option) and play with Draymond instead of Aaron fucking Baynes.            The fit with Pascal is incredible. He puts a lot of pressure on the rim so teams can‚Äôt go small against Warriors. He is a great passer that helps their motion offense. He is a great defender with size."
"Even a 5 year retrospective can be misleading, and in the best of cases (where a player spends 5 years with the same team that drafted them) it is just laden with caveats.   For example: Andrew Wiggins. What exactly was his value? He went first overall and was included in a trade for Kevin Love in like this 2nd year I think, after LeBron came back.   So he spends very little time with his original org, but was he instrumental in producing that championship in a way? How the hell do you evaluate that? Would he have produced more/faired better if he stayed with the Cavs?   There are just endless questions. If he was drafted to a different team, does that team develop him better or worse? Anthony Bennet - does his career look the same if he gets drafted in the 10-15 range? How much of the pressure of being an unexpected, and oft unwanted, number one pick was a cause of what happened to him?   Idk if that makes any sense or not."
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
"I think you're more of a hybrid between Kevin Knox and Andrew Wiggins, maybe even a little Bruno Caboclo but I see the upside. You might've slid in the draft but I see a spot for you in the league if you keep working on your game. You're a year away from being a year away"
"He is an athlete in general, which is valuable. Not every player has the ability to jump, be explosive, fast, have shake, etc. He has all of it. Maybe he doesn't jump out of the room and isn't a blur, but he is a complete athlete. He has a little bit of a handle and creates a lot of separation off the bounce. If he can just hit those difficult shots he will be a long-time player. He has the potential to be a good scorer. You also have to remember he's still SUPER young and will develop all-around. Someone who is inconsistent at 18,19, 20 will grow and learn how to be consistent. Not everyone does (like Malik Monk or Andrew Wiggins), but if they have the right mentality and work ethic they should be able to figure it out over time."
"I would be shocked if he could get that as a free agent for another team, even with the limited free agent class. But even with dumping Favors and if they were to dump Ingles as well, the Jazz are capped out, so it doesn't really matter if they're going to pay Conley 3/75 or 3/50. I guess it factors into dodging the tax, but they have to do what they have to do to not regress the roster, and just hope for continued ascension from Mitchell and perhaps getting lucky with draft picks. They also have the flexibility with mid-sized contracts, including potentially Conley in a year or two, to flip those players and future picks for a disgruntled star or even a young player like Andrew Wiggins, who may fit in well as a third option."
"Kobe is Kobe because he had the mental of MJ, Bird.  Players with Kobe‚Äôs athleticism stay Andrew Wiggins too, and that‚Äôs more of what I see for Green.  Better offensively worse defensively with Andrew Wiggins type of personality."
"Andrew Wiggins was the first pick. Jabari Parker went number two.   Anybody can do it yet they didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt understand the economics of the NBA, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre here to learn."
Andrew Wiggins worst case scenario was an all star level player back then lol
"exactly, nothing freakish, so they weren't drafted high just cause they were 'freakish athletes with no skills' which is what OP asked for. Players like Tyrus Thomas, Stromile Swift etc. are the kind (but they're big men).  I'd say andrew wiggins is as well."
"Warriors should trad both picks, andrew wiggins, james wiseman and future first picks for a tictac. I mean if there is no super star available what can you do"
"Who was the last KU ‚Äústar‚Äù to actually live up to their hype? I‚Äôm actually curious. Josh Jackson, Andrew Wiggins, Oubre, McLemore‚Ä¶.  E: Nvm. It‚Äôs Embiid. Forgot about him. He lived up to the hype."
"I guess if you squint hard enough, Aaron Wiggins turns into Andrew Wiggins"
"Im not even a Raptors fan. I think I just worded that bad. For example one possible trade could be Andrew Wiggins+James Wiseman+ 1 or 2 FRP. Another could be Wiggins+Wiseman+Kuminga.   I also have no fucking clue about how cap works and trades, could be that Im just very bad at trading"
Never trade Andrew Wiggins he was a former #1 overall draft pick still only 25 years old theres a player in tonight's draft who is 24
"&gt;The Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins  For a solid moment I was like: ""what is a post about Ender's Game doing or /r/all?"""
Siakam for Andrew Wiggins and maybe like Wiseman and one of Kuminga or Moody and or future FRP if they even have any left
I know where your coming from and I see your point but Andrew wiggins was the 2nd best player on a shitty team and 4th best player on an okay team.  Simmons is the 2nd best on a good team Even though hes appeared to have hit a ceiling
"I really wish GM's were more forward thinking. I'd love to have Patrick Williams, Kuminga, Wiseman, 14th pick, 3 future Warriors picks, and Andrew Wiggins to teach them all how to become a man.  Instead KarPax is going to ride Lavine/Vucevic to mediocriLand."
Andrew Wiggins is a genocider
Why would anyone *want* Andrew Wiggins?
"Every year, we pretend that we know for sure which players are going to be good and which aren't. Every year there's guys we think are meaningless who turn out to be really solid. Every year, there's guys we thing are going to be really solid at the top of the draft that *totally* blow.   Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014 were really underwhelming for their hype. Dante Exum and Nik Stauskas straight up were terrible NBA players. They were the 5th and 8th picks.   But that's just one year, you might say...  2015: Jahlil Okafor, pick 3...had a lot of hype as a potential #1 overall guy a few months before the draft. Total bust. Mario Hezonja, pick 5? Worthless. Mudiay and Stanley Johnson, picks 7 and 8? Total crap.  2016: Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn in the top 5. Marquese Chriss and Thon Maker in the top-10.   2017: Fultz was a bust at 1. Josh Jackson was a bust at 4. Guys 8-11 were all crap.   You give each draft a few years, and you see that there are really good players drafted in the 20s each year, and some crap picked in the top-10."
"&gt; The Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight‚Äôs NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons  I‚Äôm struggling to think of 10 current NBA players that are worth that trade package.   Ben Simmons is not one of them."
"They should have known it would be difficult post-Durant &amp; after their core got paid. The Warriors' payroll and veterans make it really difficult to re-build on the fly.  The Warriors' payroll is LOCKED UP for the next few years and they're committed to almost $140 million for just to 4 players  *Players* | 2021-22 | 2022-23 :-- | --: | --: Stephen Curry | 45.8 | ‚Äî Klay Thompson | 37.9 | 40.6 Andrew Wiggins | 31.6 | 33.6 Draymond Green | 24.0 | 25.8  If Curry leaves next FA, the Warriors have *no* chance at contention without a rebuild."
"[Mayo] The Wizards asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight‚Äôs NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Davis Bertans, according to multiple sources. The Warriors quickly turned down the offer."
Somebody tell Daryl Morey to put the bottle down. Andrew Wiggins straight up with no additional picks is all Ben Simmons is worth.
"This is kind of crazy because I don't think Ben Simmons is better then Andrew Wiggins. Hell, Simmons wouldn't even be an All Star in the West."
Warriors Legend Vince Carter  Bucks Legend Dirk Nowitzki  Bucks Legend Bogdan Bogdanovic  Cavaliers Legend Andrew Wiggins   I can go on all day
"The warriors. ‚ÄúYou had me at Andrew Wiggins, but hold up‚Äù"
"Soo, what am I missing here? What‚Äôs so good about that offer from GSW side? Two future 1s, that will be pick 27 or later? Andrew Wiggins? Two lottery picks this year that don‚Äôt do shit to help Joel Embiid?   What are we doing here?"
Andrew Wiggins and the 14th pick at most. Philly is screwed right?
"&gt;But the core pieces of that championship were all built through the draft (Thompson, Kyrie, and Wiggins turning into love).  Except the core piece was LeBron who was a free agent. You could have put LeBron on those Pacer teams as a free agent and they could have had multiple titles.  The Cavs drafting Kyrie, Thompson, Dion Waiters, Anthony Bennett, and Andrew Wiggins is what you're looking at without LeBron coming home. That is what their strategy would have produced without signing the best player in the game as a free agent. It's not exactly appealing in my opinion.  Trying to use the Cavs as an example of the tanking/drafting strategy is simply weird to me because it all hinged on signing LeBron as a free agent. Without that, they're still looking for one or two more stars assuming Kyrie stuck around for as long as he did."
"&gt; NEW YORK ‚Äî The Golden State Warriors basically assumed the 76ers‚Äô offer as a joke.  &gt; The Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight‚Äôs NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons, according to multiple sources. The Warriors quickly turned down the offer.  &gt; This comes after a source confirmed The Ringer report that the Sixers asked the San Antonio Spurs for four first-round picks, three first-round pick swaps and a young player in exchange for Simmons.  &gt; According to The Action Network, the Toronto Raptors rejected the Sixers‚Äô asking price of Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and the fourth pick in tonight‚Äôs draft for a package that included Simmons.   &gt; One league executive said the Sixers are making ‚Äútotally outlandish offers.‚Äù"
andrew wiggins is honestly worth more than ben simmons
"**Currently Better than Shai**  *Debatable*  ~~Shai is better~~   Draft Year| Name ---|--- 2011| **Kyrie Irving** 2012| **Anthony Davis** 2013| ~~Anthony Bennett~~ 2014| ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ 2015| **Karl-Anthony Towns** 2016| *Ben Simmons* 2017| ~~Markelle Fultz~~ 2018| *Deandre Ayton* 2019| **Zion Williamson** 2020| *Anthony Edwards*   u r wrong sir. Only 3 of the last 10 #1 are worst than Shai. Ayton, Edwards and Simmons can be debated, but Irving, Davis, KAT and Zion is better than Shai."
"Slightly overpaid? He is worth half of his contract.        &gt;	There‚Äôs no reason for the Warriors to try to upgrade Wiggins when they have other holes on the roster.  Hmmm, I wonder why Warriors execs and top players are targeting Siakam then. Maybe they think that someone that a former allnba, allstar and nba champion is worth more than Andrew Wiggins. Tough call!!!"
"&gt;	Ya‚Äôll don‚Äôt even watch Wiggins play  Oh shut up, I have watched Andrew play more than you have watched basketball.            Most Raptors fan have been following Andrew since he was in highschool.             &gt;	In reality, he‚Äôs our ONLY wing, who‚Äôs a defensive stud and ability to drop 20+ on any night and lead our 2nd unit.   lmao, leader of second unit vs someone a year removed from making allstar and allnba player.  &gt;	but Wiseman + 7 + 14 is WAY too much for the marginal upgrade.  Marginal upgrade? lmaooooo"
"&gt;	Siakam‚Äôs contract is longer than Wiggins and is worth more per year.   Probably because he is a much better player. Pascal is a proven top 3 player on a championship squad, and that‚Äôs worth a max. Andrew Wiggins is a league average player making max money.           &gt;	He shot sub 30% from 3 last year   Warriors fans keep bringing it up as if Pascal is a perimeter player. He is a big man that can take an open shot. And he has made that shot at a good rate any season that he hasn‚Äôt been on a road for aj entire year.           &gt;	The most I‚Äôd give up is Wiggins and 14 and really I‚Äôm not too interested in Siakam to even give that up.    Looool, Warriors fans talking about how they are not interested when their FO and top players have Pascal and Beal as their top targets."
same thing said about Andrew Wiggins when he was awful. Kat too.
"I really am not a fan of jouranlism about how ""we"" are reacting to something, especially when its so sanctimonious.  This is just a dude reading tweets and insta comments and turning it into a talking point.  There has been plenty of nuanced discussion about kyrie irving's PTO.  basketball fans talk about basketball players and their impact on basketball teams.  when andrew wiggins makes a low effort play, should we not criticize him (in OUR typical aggressive and accusatory style) because his low effort may be connected to mental health or personal reasons we can't even fathom?  when kyrie doesn't play for 2 weeks and gets fined a million dollars, we have to discuss it solemnly because hey, who can fathom his hardship?"
"Where would you value Okafor, Wiggins, etc. after their rookie years?   To value them similarly to their draft time stock would be a mistake. FFiveThirtyEight was able to correctly recognize Wiggins as a bust only ~15 games into his rookie season.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andrew-wiggins-lebron-james/"

"LeBron lost to Curry, who's second best player is andrew wiggins, while LeBron is playing with a future hof dpoy calibre player.   Normally I'd say , ""regular season lol"" but to see LeBron get annoyed makes it even funnier."
All of this optimism is leaning on the warriors sizzling 7-6 start üòÜ. Fools gold. They are overachieving and winning in spite of a less than ideal fit and under-talented roster. People bash Russell but he was an all star and had value. They could have used Russell‚Äôs contract to get 2 or 3 players‚Äî-or just a better player‚Äî-not add *Andrew Wiggins*
"I'll do whatever is asked of me for sure. Be on time for practice and all that. Take notes during film sessions.   But working out daily extra hours and/or coming in hours early to be the first in the gym and all that? Honestly I'd rather not. I mean, look at Andrew Wiggins. Dude has made 9 figures in the NBA already and work ethic rumors have dogged him since he was in high school."
"Anything above Wiggins as quality is a borderline star and its very unlikely that type of deal to be available.  Andrew matched the culture and health wise, he seems like a Rock. He is overpaid but not by much, 5, 10 mln which is Barnes money. That type ofmoney are a lot for us but nothing significant in the grand schemes of the NBA."

Andrew Wiggins
It‚Äôs not fact. The ‚Äúpicks‚Äù that ended up enticing Lebron‚Äôs return were Kyrie Irving and Andrew Wiggins as a trade piece. Both were a result of Cleveland‚Äôs poor regular season results.  The Heat ended up trading 2 low FRP and 3 SRPs. They wouldn‚Äôt have been enough to get Lebron to stay. The problem was the Heat were stuck on their 4th year over the salary cap and even keeping a MLE-salaried player was costing them 20mm+. Micky Arinson wasn‚Äôt willing to pay and the team‚Äôs depth suffered as a result.  Please think before you type.
Andrew Wiggins and Dort will be all defense first or second team.  Not dpoy because it‚Äôs hard to beat AD/Gobert/Myles Turner or Drummond.

But the only reason the Cavs won was because the 2nd best player ever happened to be born in Ohio. Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins didn't do shit.
Watch Andrew wiggins during the season Jimmy butler was in Minnesota
"Yeah that doesn't say much. I mean every GM made a call to them just to see, and they may have called to gauge the potential trade value of Andrew Wiggins, but obviously they weren't seriously considering trying aquire Harden, he doesn't fit. It doesn't take much to see that"
"Yeah people are really out here acting like he is a total albatross. Kemba,  Kevin Love, Steven Adam's, and Andrew Wiggins are all players in this price range as well and there is no argument that Tobias isn't at least comparable, if not better, than those guys. Its just a different league now in terms of salary figures."
"Andrew ""Gordon Hayward"" Wiggins"
iggins wiggins of andrew
"Warriors fans pushing their trash for good players, welcome wizards fans!   You're not interested in the second coming of Jesus, Andrew Wiggins?"
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Andrew Wiggins is a top 50 player in this league.
"Anthony Edwards is gonna be Andrew Wiggins 2.0 lmfao. He'll average 20 PPG for a couple of seasons and trick y'all into thinking he's a good scorer but the guy couldn't shoot for dick in college, can't shoot now, and probably won't be able to in the future."
"Oladipo is the better player. LeVert is just a worse Andrew Wiggins, people just don‚Äôt shit on him cause he wasn‚Äôt a 1st overall pick."
"not in order but  1. Jimmy Butler saga  2. Andrew Wiggins never developed  3. Saunders is a shit coach  4. Injuries  5. Location, lack of free agents  6. Awful roster construction  7. Bad front office"
Kyrie is someone that destroyed the warriors in a finals and you think fucking dlo is comparable. Get real.   No one on earth would trade kyrie for dlo. The fucking guy's value was andrew wiggins and a pick
"Tbh I feel like a lot of the ‚Äúpeople aren‚Äôt trying‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople are mentally weak‚Äù stuff is just people who don‚Äôt understand basketball and want to explain things in terms they know. And a lot of that has to do with the way media personalities and such speak.   I think Mark Cuban‚Äôs rant towards Skip Bayless showed that the idea of ‚Äúa team just not trying hard enough‚Äù is stupid.   And andrew Wiggins, because he isn‚Äôt vocal and doesn‚Äôt show his emotions as much, becomes a recipient of that belief."
Andrew Wiggins
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"Lol Wiggins is the only wing in the top 5.  Also, this post:  * OP talks about Andrew Wiggins being a great shot blocker even as a 6'8 wing. * Commenters talk about Myles Turner's monster block game this season.  This sub really hates Wiggins lol."
Andrew Wiggins is playing like an all defense guy. Imagine saying that a couple years ago
"The Andrew Wiggins trade wasn't just for Wiggins, it was for the pick. Which is going to be ultra valuable considering how competitive the West is.   And besides, if Wiggins keep producing like he is, then he becomes a tradable asset in the later years of his contract"
We don't have a bad gm. We don't trade for Andrew Wiggins.
"Ah yes, PPG. The metric that truly tells you how good a player is when there‚Äôs no other context to it. Andrew Wiggins is averaging about 20 PPG for his entire career, but be pretty good."
KD demands a trade and end up in golden state for andrew wiggins +1st rounders LMAO im dead
Ok go ahead and take D'lo. Working really well for Minnesota rn. Take the guy who got traded for Andrew Wiggins. All yoursüòπ
"It all comes down to properly developing and giving a shit about your rookies..   Some organizations do it well, some seem to do everything they can to ruin their players...   I think the warriors have a good record of making the best of their players... I‚Äôm going to make Andrew Wiggins an exception seeing as it‚Äôs more on him than anyone."
Sounds like Andrew Bogut doesn‚Äôt like Mark Jackson! Jackson was probably hard to deal with but damn before he got there the warriors never had a true winning culture.   That‚Äôs the furthest from the truth. I remember Draymond playing big minutes against the clippers and giving Blake Griffin all sort of problems. How would he have been out the league? Mark Jackson developed those players.  Then Steve Kerr inherited the roster. I really haven‚Äôt seen any player truly developed under Steve Kerr. Every pick they‚Äôve made has turned to trash under Kerr. We will see what Wiseman or Wiggins becomes. People acting like Steve Kerr is a great coach... Luke Walton went 12-0 with that roster.
"Iggins wiggins of andrew played great tonight on defense, i hope he does it every game"
Caris LeVert is who Andrew Wiggins thinks he is   For this one both LeVert and Wiggins fans will be furious at comparing each guy to the other pretending their guy is so clearly better which is the hilarious part
2 observations on watching the first game that involves the warriors this season:  1. Andrew Wiggins played absolutely stellar defense.  2. The box and 1 Indiana was playing clearly bothered Curry. He looked so gassed in the 4th. Kerr absolutely needs to find alternatives to what they were doing because it clearly isn't working.
Andrew wiggins has 5 blocks this game
And they gave him prime Andrew Wiggins too smh stacking the deck again
So who has Andrew Wiggins making an All-Defensive team on their bingo card? Anyone? Anyone?
How is andrew wiggins playing this kind of defense?
Andrew fucking Wiggins. He has been on fire lately hot damn
Andrew ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Wiggins.
ANDREW WIGGINS
&gt; Meanwhile the Warriors are making Andrew Wiggins a winning player  I guess shooting 7/17 and playing shit defense every game make you a winner these days. He's the exact same player as he was in minnesota.
"what does everyone think about calling Andrew Wiggins ""Wiggy?"""
"So Andrew Wiggins has long been criticized as inconsistent. Despite that this writer spends 1000 words singing his praises after ten games, in two of which he was, and I quote, ‚Äúhorrendous.‚Äù  He also doesn‚Äôt mention that one of the main Wiggins criticisms is consistency.   Meanwhile Russell, who was a key part of a playoff team, is criticized for playing poorly on a team that just came off a season so bad they got the number one pick, and that has it‚Äôs best player out for seven games.   Just... come on. Maybe Wiggins will be great with Golden State. I hope so, he‚Äôs a fun player to watch when he flashes his potential. Maybe Russell will underperform. I hope not. He‚Äôs a Buckeye so I‚Äôll always root for him. But basing any of these conclusions off of ten games in *this* season is just a ridiculous thing to do."
"Imagine being KD if that happens lmao  Leaves the Warriors to form ‚Äúhis own‚Äù super team with his best friend on an already deep Nets squad. Only for his best friend to leave the game before they even get a chance to compete.  Meanwhile the Warriors are making Andrew Wiggins a winning player, and turned losing KD into him and probably a top tier lotto pick this year.  Maybe Dray was right?"
Andrew Wiggins üò§
"Honestly have watched like 2 wizards games, so i don't have a strong opinion on the lad.  Phenomenal hair, though.  There's an argument to be made for the need of secondary playmaking on the dubs, but any dubs fan at this point will retort with this:   First--draymond green is our secondary playmaker and Andrew wiggins is actually evolving extremely nicely into a role as rotational playmaker, finding open shooters.  Second--pretty tough to convince me any of these rookies has a higher ceiling than wiseman, and as far as laying a foundation post-Splash n Dray, a two-way stretch 5 that looks something like a cross between robinson/bosh is 100% making us happy as future title challengers, i don't care how many triple doubles lamelo throws up, or what deni's playmaking looks like."
But your opinion on him doesn't invalidate the fact that he is a good playmaker. And it's not his fault his costar was Andrew Wiggins...
"Just some articles:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2781284-jimmy-butler-reportedly-took-issue-with-andrew-wiggins-effort-defense  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/15/report-jimmy-butler-had-problems-with-andrew-wiggins-last-season/  I can't dig out all the tweets from our beat writers, but the clear issue was that Butler wanted to be designated a franchise max player, but he needed to wait a year for the team to extend him using his bird rights. In the meantime, they gave Wiggins the max, and Butler took offense to that. He went to Thibs and asked to be let out when it became clear he wasn't going to be ""the guy"" for the franchise."
"Hmm. If we‚Äôre truly saying like no defense at all, that‚Äôs hard to find. People like Luka had atleast an inkling of defense within them.  But:  Trae Young/Devin Booker/Andrew Wiggins/Kevin Love/Thomas Bryant"
"Andrew Wiggins used to be Maple Jordan, now MJ is Burger Wiggins"

Wiggins promised the Warriors he would be happy https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html
Steve Kerr said it best about Wiggins. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not looking for him to change our franchise.‚Äù Honestly the pressure that Andrew had on him in Minnesota is greater than what it is in Golden State.  Now admittedly I do not watch a lot of Minnesota basketball. I can only tell you what I‚Äôve seen this year. Wiggins looks engaged and happy to be here. He‚Äôs also contributing in a major way to the few wins we‚Äôve had so far this season. It seems like found money since so many other ‚Äúfans‚Äù have said Wiggins is a bust and just not a good player.  It‚Äôs really just a change in expectations it seems like. Can it be that you‚Äôre taking it a little too personal?
"&gt;he's as bad as Andrew fucking wiggins, are you on crack?  you are the one not watching basketball then...."
"Dude has a below average true shooting every single year.  You obviously don't understand basketball very well if you think he's one of the best iso scorers, he's as bad as Andrew fucking wiggins, are you on crack?"
"This guy doesn't know about Andrew ""Maple Double Iron Core Beyblade"" Wiggins"
"Lol Andrew drilled a 3 but was a little slow to come back on defense. Blazers came in running with the ball and Draymond couldn‚Äôt cover him in time. You could hear Draymond get really upset and yell at Wiggins ‚ÄúCmon man, that ain‚Äôt my man‚Äù.  Dude has been on top of it though for the majority. I thought I would be more wary of Wiggins than Kelly Oubre but the turn tables"
My biggest pet peeve in the NBA is commentators being huge homers.   ‚ÄúWhat a stop by Andrew Wiggins‚Äù  That wasn‚Äôt a stop he just missed the shot. UGH  Pelicans commentators are terrible homers to the point where they can not give any credit to the opposing team. There was a play where a hornets player did an insanely tough reverse layup and the commentators were like ‚Äúbad defense by the Pelicans‚Äù DUDE WHAT   Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
Andrew Wiggins: You sure bout that?
[OC] Curry gave Andrew Wiggins happiness
I‚Äôm more upset with players like Ben Simmons and Andrew Wiggins not hitting FTs than I am with Giannis taking his time FT shooting.
What an embarrassment of wealth the Warriors have- imagine having to choose who to start between Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre.
Andrew Wiggins and Jimmy Butler do not love it the same.
"Kyrie was already a 2x All-Star, he was young but he was by that point established as a star and was probably a major reason why LeBron joined them in the first place. Booker was certainly emerging as a star at that point too of course, even though the All-Star bids hadn't come yet.  Ayton is more comparable to Andrew Wiggins in this scenario."
I miss the Old Andrew Wiggins
New Andrew Wiggins
I'd say technically both because he probably only went back because they had kyrie and the #1 pick (Andrew Wiggins) and then promptly orchestrated trading Wiggins for Kevin Love
Andrew Wiggins was their best player. It's not like they're that great of a team. RJ Barrett was his sidekick and choked in the 2nd half of the CR game.  This was also the first time out for this group.  Cory Joseph was the best player on the 2019 World Cup team. Tristan Thompson was the best player on the 2016 Olympic qualifying team. 20-year old Andrew Wiggins was the best player on the 2015 team.  What does why does this keep happening to Canada basketball? mean? This is the first time they fielded a good team and they lost an overtime game. And even though their roster is solid it's not like they have a superstar on it.
Did you really expect a RJ Barrett and Andrew Wiggins led team to do anything? üòÇ
"I'd see a better argument for genetic lottery, but you really think it's all about hard work? Let me introduce you to Andrew Wiggins and Ben Simmons..."
Hopefully Andrew Wiggins wins then lmao/s
"here's the concept with the Max contract that I don't think people understand.  If you pay player X the max, he better be a guy you can count on as a Big 3 player on your team.  if he can't be a top 3 guy on a finals team then it's not worth handing out. If you think he is then it's a definite lock.  Andrew Wiggins was never going to be the 2nd or 3rd best player on a Championship team, and the wolves still paid him... and as soon as you make a move like that you're pretty much set for mediocrity"
"Andrew Wiggins?  Solid player. Part of the solution.  Not his fault the wolves overpaid.  People are gonna love this mfer in his late 20s, early 30s years when his third deal comes to earth a bit."
"Exactly. And as you said, in 2008 they needed Kobe to clutch them the Gold medal against Spain which at the time had 3 NBAers on their roster. And that was a team of prime Kobe, Lebron, Wade, Carmelon, Howard, CP3, Jason Kidd , Chris Bosh etc.   Then in 2012 with a still prime Lebron + KD + Kobe + CP3 + Harden + Wetbrook + AD +Carmelo almost lost to a Lithuanian team with literally 0 NBA players on their roster. They won that game by 5.   Now talk to me about how Canada should have a cakewalk because they have RJ Barret and Andrew Wiggins ..."
Was this the biggest moment of Andrew Wiggins' career?
"His name is Andrew Wiggins? He's a letter over, but from now on, he shall be known as Enders."
I really wish Andrew Wiggins knew how good he actually is at basketball
Im gonna miss watching Andrew Wiggins
Iggins wiggins of andrew became tmac for a minute.. lmao
"Yeah that was definitely an omission on my end although one can quibble about how much of that is solely due to LeBron being born in Ohio.  One could have easily imagined the mid 2010 Cavs hitting the salary cap to keep their ‚Äòtalented young roster‚Äô of Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters, Tristan Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins together."
"IDK about salary but Andrew Wiggins from the dubs or DRose from the knicks, straight up."
"Did he really have better teammates tho?  Outside of this year his two best teammates were D'Angelo Russell for like a couple games, Andrew Wiggins and Jimmy Butler  Boogie not counting Golden State has played with jrue holiday, IT (for a short time), AD and rondo"
Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal and Bradley Beal  Andrew Wiggins and DeAndre Liggins
Steph lost with Andrew Wiggins or an old Draymond as his 2nd best player and technically he made the playoffs while Oscar had a prime Jerry Lucas yet didn‚Äôt make it 3 years in a row
"Andrew Wiggins.  People say he‚Äôs got that ‚Äúmodest/humble‚Äù Canadian background. But I always thought here‚Äôs a dude who loves to play, has raw talent, but doesn‚Äôt have that superstar drive."
"KAT looks like a worse playmaker because his whole career hes been passing to an Open Andrew Wiggins or Okogie for 3, of course hes gonna not look good as a playmaker. KAT playing with guys like Dlo and Malik whos a sniper averages 6+ assists you will find that out next season if the teams healthy.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Only thing KAT is definitively better than Cousins at is Shooting and not being a hot head. Everything else is both of their games can be disputed  &amp;#x200B;  KAT does everything Boogie did, but better and so much more efficient."
"You did not just say Andrew Wiggins was a great Timberwolves player, or do you not even know that Butler played 1 game post All-Star break that season. Just stop talking out your ass. KAT is 25, and will be 26 next season. There is plenty of time to make the playoffs."
"He's 23, athletic, can shoot, and decently good on defense. He's not gonna be a focal point offensively but he's a great piece to have. A max for John Collins is about 32M/year or about what Kevin Love, Andrew Wiggins, and Kristaps Porzingis are making right now. I don't see why he shouldn't get that much money."
"Why do people act like the Warriors need to, or even CAN get new good players?   They have Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Andrew Wiggins. All on big contracts.   They need to use their 2 picks to add two cheap rookies that hopefully play well and complement their team. Keep Wiseman. The core 4 above is your team. If you need more than that to contend, you might as well just blow it up."
"Maple Jordan( Andrew Wiggins)  Cp3-6 Weeks  Pandemic P, Pg13%  Fidget Spinner/Beyblade (Siakam)  Russell Westbrick   Demar Defrozen   Stephanie Curry (Steph)  Keisha Durant, Snake (Kd)  LeGm, LeMickey (Bron)  Drew Bledsoe (Eric Bledsoe)  Saboner (Sabonis)  All that comes to mind atm   Donkey (Draymond)  Pfizer P (Porzingis)"
"I thought this was pretty accurate (although Wiggins is only 26 and can still improve):   &gt;[""The biggest issue is whether or not Wiggins has the mental make up to maximize his immense physical gifts. While some scouts are extremely high on him, there are just as many that question his focus and passion for the game""](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/andrew-wiggins/)"
"&gt; Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Yeah, no."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"

How are we going to stop Andrew Wiggins and RJ Barrett?!
I wonder what impact Andrew Wiggins playing for Nick Nurse will have on potential trades in the NBA
"Andrew Wiggins was always going #1, Embiid was a better player at Kansas but the hype around Wiggins was unreal and his lack of effort at KU was hand waived away as him preserving himself for the draft since he was locked in at 1"
"Dude is weird af lol ""Andrew Wiggins is a bad defender"" is such a strange hill to die on"
Welcome to the Andrew Wiggins Experience.
"Nah what he‚Äôs saying is the players agreed to it, NBA players have more control over their league than any other professional sports league.  This league money that you refer to is given out to NBA players at a higher proportion than any other league.. the more money the league makes the higher the salary cap goes.. this is why John Wall makes 40M and trash players like Andrew Wiggins get max deals making &gt;30M a year."
"Jamal Murray - SGA - Corey Joseph   Dillion Brooks - Lugentz Dort     RJ Barrett - Andrew Wiggins   Kelly Olynyk - Chris Boucher   Tristan Thompson -  Dwight Powell - Khem Birch     Barely misses cut: NAW, Nembhard, Ejim, Mulder"
Warriors Legend Andrew Wiggins.
"Warriors get:   * Gordon Hayward   * Terry Rozier   Hornets get:   * Andrew Wiggins   * James Wiseman   * 7th overall   * 2022 1st   Warriors get a minor upgrade at SF as well as a dude who would be 6MOY or could start while Klay works back into shape. Hornets get a good SF, a center prospect, a high lotto pick to add another young guy to the Lamelo/Graham/PJ/Wiseman core, and a 2022 pick as sweetener."
"Cory Joseph, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell"
LBJ made the finals where his second best player was worse Andrew Wiggins by far
Golden State had a top 5 defense. Who are we crediting for that? Andrew Wiggins?
"Bulls get:   * Andrew Wiggins  * James Wiseman   * 7, 14 picks this year   Warriors get:  * Nikola Vucevic   * Thad Young  The Warriors do it to go win now, swapping project players for established contributors. We re-sign Oubre in this scenario and run Steph/Klay/Oubre/Dray/Vucevic with Poole/Juan/Thad/Looney off the bench. Just need one more guard in free agency and we‚Äôre set to contend. Austin rivers with the MLE maybe?  The Bulls do it to rapidly build around Lavine. I think a team with Lavine/Vucevic as it‚Äôs core isn‚Äôt going to do anything, so they need to pivot to really take a step forward. The Warriors assets move them in that direction. Let‚Äôs say they sign and trade Markkanen for a PG, maybe Rubio. They can compete with Rubio/Zach/Wiggins/PatWil/Theis while developing Coby, Wiseman, and the 7th/14th picks"
Ben Simmons is the new Andrew Wiggins
"Wiggins had insane athleticism, was a spectacular defender in college, and was a great scorer. His main problem was focus and mentality not skill which is how we saw him bust  [https://www.nbadraft.net/players/andrew-wiggins/](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/andrew-wiggins/)"
Andrew Wiggins was Maple Jordan and the next coming of LeBron
"it's not, Andrew Wiggins played in the 2015 FIBA Americas, and was infamously benched in a crucial game against Venezuela in crunchtime in favor of Aaron Doornekamp, who commited a loose ball foul that gave VEN the FT's that cost Canada the game.  It was literally Wiggins' last appearance on the Sr team until this summer lol"
Look at his stats https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?CF=GP*G*50&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season. Andrew Wiggins put together an objectively great defensive season. I'm fine arguing about if he had an elite defensive season but saying he just had a good defense season is slander
"Lu Dort,Rj Barrett,and Andrew Wiggins wouldn‚Äôt be the worst player on team USA this year"
"See: Hassan Whiteside, Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins until this year, Andre Drummond etc."
Yep. Cocaine scandals decimated the team. One of those dudes was Andrew Wiggins‚Äô dad
"Lakers would give up anyone not named LeBron or Davis for Dame, OKC can trade a stack of picks, Celtics can give a young player for Dame there‚Äôs tons of options better for Portland if they want a chance. More realistic is a Ben Simmons for Andrew Wiggins trade or along those levels of players to look at."
I wonder where Nick Nurse and Andrew Wiggins are right now? https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/basketball/olympic-basketball-qualifier-victoria-preview-1.6080731
"Is an ALL NBA player who was the second scoring option in a championship team who also happens to be elite defensively and can create his own shot and playmake for others an upgrade over Andrew Wiggins? You know what, I don't know. And my indecision has nothing to do with the fact that I was repeatedly dropped on the head as a child"
Defensive numbers can be extremely misleading. It depends a lot on who you share the floor with. You‚Äôre really gonna try to tell me Isaiah Thomas is a better defender than Andrew Wiggins? I feel like Minny fans just have a vendetta against Wiggins (understandably) but he was really good for the Warriors on both sides of the ball last year and I‚Äôm not sure why we would put more stake in his performance on pretty bad teams for the first 6 years of his career over how he played with the core he would continue to play with.
"In order for this trade to work, Andrew Wiggins would have to be in the deal to make salaries line up. Why would the Warriors trade Wiggins, a lottery pick, and James Wiseman for Siakam?   Siakam is nice, he's a slight upgrade over Wiggins, but not nearly worth giving up James Wiseman and the number 7 pick on top of the deal.   Maybe a sign and trade with Oubre + #7 and #14 for Siakam but then the Warriors are paying a crazy luxury tax again.  I think the Warriors are hunting for bigger game than Pascal Siakam."
"The Andrew Wiggins contract is close to a max deal, they could send him along with Wiseman and that would be greater than a max contract slot. That's not really gutting their roster if they get in return someone like Kawhi"
"Huh? Who said he‚Äôs ‚Äútwo scoring options‚Äù lol  You‚Äôre over thinking this. Wiggins role will remain the same. He‚Äôll get the a similar amount of touches. The only difference is Wood is a monumental upgrade over Wiseman and Looney. Scorers *benefit* from playing with each other, this is proven time and time again.   You can also use this sort of idiotic logic for any hypothetical upgrade the Warriors look at. I can assure you taking shots away from Andrew fucking Wiggins is not a reason to hold off on trading for a clear upgrade."
"Kobe also wasn't a consistent defender. Contrary to his rep for ""locking down,"" that was for the final 2 minutes of a game or rare  situations. He coasted on defense a LOT and gambled in passing lanes for steals way too often.  Peruse through his advanced stats and they are damning. His BEST defensive season was '99 when he rated mid 40s in the league. Andrew Wiggins rates as a more consistent defender than Kobe. Larry Bird and Dirk Nowitzki have more win shares them Kobe.   His All-D selections are a symbol of pre-analytics, where gaudy steal totals, slapping the floor on D, and making an I'm-serious-guys underbite face fooled a lot of people. He could've been a consistent 2way player like Dwade if he wanted, but he didn't want to sacrifice his offense to expend that kind of effort of d"
Andrew Wiggins was supposed to the Maple Jordan but never did much
"Are you holding Ben Simmons, a guy who people said would be LeBron if he had a jump shot to the same standard as Andrew Wiggins? Come on man."
Ahh the Andrew Wiggins special
Not to mention it‚Äôs audited by one of the biggest law firms in the country. They aren‚Äôt throwing away literally everything so that andrew wiggins can go to cleveland
"Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, #7, #14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st   Steph/Dame/Klay/Dray/Looney"
Correct me if Im wrong but I think both Stephen Curry and Andrew Wiggins are part of the Golden State Warriors‚Äô roster.
"lol at *NBA All Star Game selections* being an accolode you put stock in. No one in sports history has been handed more bogus awards than Kobe     '98 he made an All-Star team scoring 15/3/3 on 42% shooting CERTIFIED BOGUS  '06 he should've been barred from All-Star consideration given he was ACTIVELY DEFENDING HIMSELF FROM ADMITTED SODOMIZATION AND WITNESS INTIMIDATION - Certified sad state of a culture of mental illnesess and toxic machismo  '13 he was gifted an ASG when he played SIX GAMES at 13ppg CERTIFIED MOST BOGUS AWARD OF ALL TIME  '14 gifted ASG on he played 35 games and shot 37% from the field CERTIFIED BOGUS      '15 lifetime achievement award ASG gift 17 ppg on 35% shooting CERTIFIED BOGUS  &amp;#x200B;  I don't have the time but Kobe's All-D selections are literally the single best way to reconcile just how dumb award selections were pre-analytics. I am not exaggerating: Kobe never deserved an All-D selection. His best defensive season was '99 when he rated the 44th best defender in the league. Andrew Wiggins rates as a more consistent defender than Kobe. Dirk Nowitzki has more defensive win shares than Kobe. Kobe loafed on defense for 46 minutes a game. He overrelied on jumping passing lanes to pad his steals stats like Jordan, but got burned twice as much as MJ because Kobe was only 70% as athletic. He was a fucking actor who tugged on his shorts and did his ugly underbite face and slapped the floor to indicate he was going to play lockdown defense in the last 2 minutes. He was not a consistent defender, or a plus defender, or a reliable defender in the first 3 quarters, he was scored on or burned more than All-D caliber players. Simply put every measurable analytic computes what he really was on defense, a turnstile for 94% of the game and a guy who saved his juice for offence"
"its just impossible to say though, people thought andrew wiggins would be the next lebron too  obviously nobody expected giannis to be a 2 time MVP or he would have gone first overall in his draft.. instead of anthony bennett lol  projections and scouting can only do so much"
"Expected. Not sure fire.... Now I don‚Äôt see Jaylen being a bust at all. I believe he could be a 20+ game scorer down the line, but I don‚Äôt see him reaching that All-NBA type level. I see him being right above an Andrew Wiggins but right below a Jaylen Green. But of course only time will tell. Hopefully he proves me wrong"
Andrew Wiggins for sure
"Andrew Wiggins is Canadian, should be in there"
"There is no fucking way Simmons is a better player than Wiggins. More talented? Sure, use any lingo you want but Andrew Wiggins was great last year and fits perfectly with Dray and Steph."

"Andrew ""cap space"" wiggins."
Andrew Wiggins was compared to LeBron or that he‚Äôd be a good three and d player which he does neither particularly well
"If Cleveland is trying to accumulate draft picks for him I'm not certain they'd be great picks. If someone in contention wants to throw multiple late 1st round picks for sexton, that deal sounds better for them than for Cleveland. GSW could be looking to get back under the tax and use their picks to trade for someone still on a rookie deal but more established. Wiggins to Cleveland?!  GSW sends 7th, 14th pick + Andrew Wiggins Cleveland send Colin sexton  Trade machine says success. Not sure this is a good trade for anyone but Cleveland. You get 3 tries at the draft and 61m coming off the books in 2023. Unfortunately you have to pay Kevin love and Andrew Wiggins that money until then."
cavs dont want andrew wiggins lol
"Rockets are better than a Team Canada that could run RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, etc etc. Really dude?"
Wtf is this hypothetical where ANDREW WIGGINS is taking 10-15 3s a game. When would that ever happen in an NBA basketball game.
"nah 48 has been the ceiling for a while. When David Thompson was playing that was his measured vertical, dunno how they measured it back then but that's what he's most famous for. Obviously there was no draft combine back then. Also Andrew Wiggins and Zion supposedly hit 48 at their individual workouts, they were both consensus #1 picks and skipped the combine."
~~Vaughan~~ Hodan Nalayeh Secondary School legend Andrew Wiggins
"Not all players are the same, andrew Wiggins went from being a below 35% career 3 point shooter to a 38% 3 point shooter on 5.2 attempts on GSW.   Why do you think that is?"
"Simmons is objectively the more awarded player, yes.  But let's be real here: if your team is in the playoffs this year, who would you rather have on your team: Andrew Wiggins or Ben Simmons?  I think everyone says Wiggins. Comparable defensive impact, but Wiggins also provides you with consistency secondary/tertiary scoring from all three levels and can't be played off of the court in the clutch. Also does not attract media attention at all, which helps team chemistry and a focused locker room.  Simmons is a wholly unique player, with clear strengths and flaws, but Andrew Wiggins is simply more of a winning player. Wiggins has obviously shown that he'll never be a superstar and carry a team on his back when people thought he could when he got drafted, but Wiggins has proven himself to be someone who can be a big contributor on any team that wants to win."
"True, but, I mean, I never understood the hype for Ben Simmons, Derrick Rose, or Andrew Wiggins in college. Ingram seemed like the obvious #1 choice, and as a Kansas fan, I saw Wiggins and Embiid play together and knew that Embiid was better, and I just watched Michael Beasley just beat every record that Kevin Durant just set. So, I mean, me vs. consensus #1 isn't exactly a winning record. But it's not necessarily a losing record, either. Projecting the future is hard."
"Ben Simmons had lebron junior hype around him. Andrew wiggins also. Fultz was Harden. Before that was Bennet.  Number one picks are not a sure thing, regardless of the hype. I'd rather take a surefire top center in Ayton who is great already."
"Nick Nurse on Andrew Wiggins: ‚ÄúAwesome pics. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got man. Wanna see how freakin' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get. Thanks for the motivation.‚Äù"
"&gt;  Remember as well, the Cavs have sucked since 2018, and they‚Äôve been rewarded for it plenty of times.   False.  They've had zero lottery picks since LeBron left after 2018 until now.  As the Cavs dropped out of the lottery each of the previous three years, they were not ""rewarded"" for sucking.  Since 1986, the Cavs have drafted in the top 3 a total of..... 5 times.  In 35 years, it's been six if you count this pick (the lottery didn't expand to the top four picks until 2019):  1986 - #1 (Brad Daugherty) 2003 - #1 (LeBron James) 2011 - #1 (Kyrie Irving - *courtesy of the LA Clippers*) 2013 - #1 (Anthony Bennett) 2014 - #1 (Andrew Wiggins) 2021 - #3 (TBD)  The 2013 &amp; 2014 draft classes are among two of the worst rated classes in the last 25 years, &amp; Kyrie doesn't even really because it was the pick from the Clippers trade involving the Baron Davis salary dump.  If you consider being given the #1 pick in two of the worst draft classes almost a decade ago being ""rewarded"" I have some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you."
Andrew Wiggins?
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
Like when Andrew Wiggins was dubbed the Canadian Lebron?
may i introduce you to Cj McCollum and pre-warriors Andrew Wiggins
He is brandon roy. He is not much of a scorer tho even if he is efficient. But he is so good. But i will rank andrew wiggins over cade. Wiggins is all hype
"as a warriors fan, getting to watch Andrew Wiggins play for my team is incredible. I can't recommend it enough"
never having to watch andrew wiggins play again for my team is incredible. i cant recommend it enough
Andrew Wiggins
I‚Äôd take Andrew Wiggins for +4000 if he was on there.  Not really sure why Draymond is on the list.  These guys probably don‚Äôt watch a lot ball.
That and closing the gap between his %s on shots outside the paint from the left side of the court vs the right side. His whole career he‚Äôs near Kevin Durant level on the left and near Andrew Wiggins level on the right i haven‚Äôt seen a split quite like it over a large sample size. Some team is going to game plan against that in a playoff series at some point if it keeps up
"If you think Jimmy Butler was fine being paid way less than Andrew Wiggins , I got a bridge to sell you .  Maybe he didnt have a problem with him personally (who would, Andrew is a very nice guy), but he certainly had a problem playing for a team that was giving 25% of their cap to Wiggins .  That is what I recall hearing at the time.  The issues with KAT did seem personal though , on the other hand"
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2856653-report-andrew-wiggins-contract-had-role-in-jimmy-butler-tension-with-t-wolves  Apparently ESPN reported that Jimmy was frustrated that Wiggins had not lived up to the max contract they gave him, and I'm pretty sure he was also pissed that he didn't get offered a max extension from the wolves either."
Example number 1: Traded Andrew Wiggins and probably a top 5 pick for a player who is worse than Andrew Wiggins
"all of it, you cant really separate one from the other.  Wiggins getting the max is part of what Jimmy didnt like .  Why would he stick around on a team where he's getting paid significantly less than Andrew Wiggins?  Just the whole fucking thing man, there's really nothing to hold onto to anymore.  Its over, we're headed to Seattle or somewhere not in minnesota in a few years"
"&gt;I mean, as a Warriors fan, surely you know that the reason your teams were godly and more than the sum of their parts from 2014-16 was the amount of high IQ role players you had on your team: Draymond, Iguodala, DLee, Livingston, Bogut, Barbosa etc.  Yes, sorry but what point is it you're trying to make here?   &gt;But at the end of the day, he's still Andrew Wiggins with a low basketball IQ.   At the end of the day he has played perfectly fine for us. In the games I've watched this season, all but 1, he had not been some crazy outlier for low bb iq. A couple mistakes here and there but for the most part he's gelling nicely. It's so weird having a fan of another team tell me how Wiggins has been playing when I've seen like 20 some games of it with my own eyes lol"
"Well obviously, Wiggins is a much better fit with star players than D'Lo is, D'Lo is not a scalable player at all, he has to be on the ball running 50 PnRs a game to be useful, Wiggins can at least fill the Harrison Barnes role of standing in the corner and making open 3s and being a versatile, switchable good man defender.   But at the end of the day, he's still Andrew Wiggins with a low basketball IQ.   I mean, as a Warriors fan, surely you know that the reason your teams were godly and more than the sum of their parts from 2014-16 was the amount of high IQ role players you had on your team: Draymond, Iguodala, DLee, Livingston, Bogut, Barbosa etc."
"Wiggins was a throw-in to get the Minnesota pick, he has no long term value to you guys except for being salary filler in a trade for a star down the line, he's most definitely not a ""core piece,"" he's shittier Harrison Barnes.   And you don't pass on taking a potentially elite prospect because of fucking Andrew Wiggins.   And what's even worse about that logic is they all could've played together, Wiggins at the 4, Draymond at the 5."
Andrew Wiggins and Wiseman?
Andrew Wiggins should get a nod as well
Zion Williamson is just Andrew Wiggins with a better shooting percentage
Some guys off the top of my head that are getting nowhere near the all-star consideration they deserve are 100% Maple Jordan AKA Andrew Wiggins and DeMaR DeRoZaN
ANDREW WIGGINS WILL WIN DPOY AND JAMAL MURRAY IS WASHED
Andrew Wiggins over Ayton? What in the hell
what's the star level player in denver this year? andrew wiggins is probably having a better year than all of them
"Yeah, I guess so based on what I replied to above.    At that point, idk how it would go down. In my mind I‚Äôm like, there‚Äôs people who didn‚Äôt have the warriors even making the playoffs, and Curry‚Äôs best spacing comes from Andrew Wiggins and his brother-in-law. I think Steph would have to get the nod over Lebron considering Lebron has AD and an all around better supporting cast. I believe the media would push very hard for Lebron considering how old he is though."
Poor Kyrie has it so hard. Try going on a 4 game roadtrip with no centers and the tallest dude on the roster is Andrew Wiggins. Shut up Kyrie
"Yeah, like the second best scoring threat on his team is Andrew fucking Wiggins. It's absurd what he's doing, and it's not like people don't have Curry tape."
&gt; everyone just looks despondent and don‚Äôt even wanna look at him.  What's Kelly Oubre or Damion Lee or Andrew Wiggins going to say? They're a bunch of scrubs.
"Remember the hype around Andrew Wiggins? Yeah, don‚Äôt believe the hype til he hits the league and does it in the league."
"Even if he and Gelo join the hornets, or whatever team together, I don't think Lonzo will play freely. Maybe when he's 25-30 we will see more glimpses of that UCLA Lonzo.   I think he got to the league and found out he can't really play halfcourt basketball. I'd say a great number of his mixtapes, highlights of him getting 7 - 11 assists were from fast breaks. Running a halfcourt offense seems foreign to him. That DEEP step back 3 in college, is now a hugging the 3pt line three and everyone knows his step back like everyone knows Andrew wiggins loves the spin move.   Lonzo just doesn't have shot creation skills even though he's taller and longer than just about every starting guard. When he gets by his guy, his layup package is just weak as hell. Gelo, of given the chance the chance to be a Klay Thompson type, would be better in the league than Lonzo long term."
"Original comment I responded to  &gt;I can‚Äôt believe the Warriors‚Äô most consistent player besides Steph is fucking Andrew Wiggins lmao, like wtf  saying that 2 years ago.  You  &gt;But saying he was the only reason you guys were in the game tonight is laughable bullshit that shows you didn't actually watch the game  You = idiot"
"His scoring (or non-scoring, more precisely) is 100% a big issue, especially since Andrew Wiggins is the second best scorer in the starting lineup with Thompson out. However, he is still a great passer for his position and his defense is still good and critical to the team if he can turn it up in the playoffs like he normally does."
I think this every time Wanamaker and Bazemore combine for a missed open layup as Andrew Wiggins smiles
"I can‚Äôt believe the Warriors‚Äô most consistent player besides Steph is fucking Andrew Wiggins lmao, like wtf imagine saying that 2 years ago."
"which time?? In the last 12 years they've had the up and coming spooky teams of:   * 2007-2009: Al Jefferson, Sebastian Telfair, Corey Brewer * 2010-2014: Kevin Love, Derrick Williams and Ricky Rubio * 2015-2019: Andrew Wiggins, KAT, Zach Lavine * 2020-Present: KAT, D'lo Russell, Anthony Edwards"
Anthony Edwards and Andrew Wiggins are the best iso scorers of all time right now per NBA‚Äôs tracking data right now.
"Andrew Wiggins is living proof that having many bites at the apple is a great thing, even in the NBA. The wolves and warriors know a lot about that guy."
Paul George is a glorified Andrew Wiggins
"Your argument is all over the place, first you said KAT provides the same spacing as Steph (he doesn't, Steph's offball movement gets people way more open than any other good shooter), then you said he doesn't need to be the #2 guy when he still has that pressure and he's doing it in fewer shots which is why his efficiency is up, you said he couldn't thrive in the same situation in MIN but now you're admitting that he had bad playmakers next to him.   Andrew Wiggins this season  17.9 points  47.3 FG% (career-high)  38.7 3P% (career-high)  54.2 eFG% (career-high)  56.0 TS% (career-high)  1.3 blocks (career-high)  1.5 turnovers (career-low)  Some of it is better coaching, better system, better playmakers, and some of it is personal improvement and better shot selection. It's ok to acknowledge that he's playing better. And maybe MIN fans didn't want Wiggins taking more shots, but GSW fans certainly do because our alternative is Oubre chucking and missing layups and going 5-16 while Wiggins is 9-12 and hitting almost every shot he made in the 2nd half."
If you‚Äôre letting Andrew Wiggins deny you from the paint there‚Äôs something wrong
"If Warriors win tonight, Bill Simmons will forever call this game the ""Andrew Wiggins Revenge Game"" lmao. Lakers need to win this for Russillo's sake."
Andrew Wiggins is actually pretty fun to watch. He's totally flown under my radar for the past two years
A great Andrew Wiggins game literally looks exactly like Kawhi Leonard to me
"Van Gundy said it man, Andrew Wiggins is the key piece if the Warriors want to snatch this one. Draymond Green will give AD hell, Steph Curry will do what he does, but Warriors need Wiggins to have a great game."
That's #1 pick Andrew Wiggins to you
The Andrew Wiggins revenge game
ANDREW WIGGINS
ANDREW WIGGINS IS CALLING LEBRON HIS DADDY
Is that Andrew Wiggins or Maple Jordan?
ANDREW WIGGINS!!!
Iggins Wiggins of Andrew!!
Okay Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins is still in the NBA?
IGGINS WIGGINS OF ANDREW
Andrew Wiggins closest game to the playoffs
Andrew Wiggins. He seemed to have the athleticism but never seemed to break out consistently.
"I think it's a good argument until you look at their actual numbers. Steph really averaging 32ppg on 65.5 TS%. Joe Ingles just had one of the best shooting seasons ever and he finished at 68 TS%. Steph's second and third best offensive players were Jordan Poole and Andrew Wiggins. But I'd agree that generally, I think the latter is more impressive, and I'll admit that I'm biased."
It's like Timberwolves fans have completely erased Andrew Wiggins from their memory. They're flat out back to looking at raw numbers again.
"Your comment makes no sense. Please explain how my statements are ‚Äúidiotic.‚Äù I just showed you the value he adds. I just think Jokic adds more value this season. Yet I can see how someone rationalizes Steph Bc he did it with less.   Also, the people voting on the mvp are not ‚Äúexperts‚Äù lmao. They don‚Äôt even watch the games except for a few marquee matchups. For example, Stephen A. Smith said he would trade Andrew Wiggins for a bucket of chicken. Anyone who knows basketball understands Wiggins impact and value to the warriors defensively. Another example is Rachel Nichols voting for Dwayne Wade to an all nba team in his retiring year instead of Klay Thompson. They don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù basketball. They get paid to pretend they know basketball"
Bill Simmons wanted to trade Tatum for Simmons in the 2019 offseason because he was worried about ‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins or Jeff Green potential‚Äù. Good thing his opinions don‚Äôt matter.
"to be fair, imagine being the lakers, you have a fucked up season with injuries, and you end it with a play-in game which you could expect to be easy but then you turn around and who is it - it's scoring leader mvp level steph curry, with defensive king draymond green, with andrew wiggins reborn as an all star level 3rd option.   i bet they can't be happy either lmao"
"Andrew Wiggins gonna watch this and think ""what is this about entertained that he's talking about"""
"Dunno why, but I've always had Andrew Wiggins stock. I think his talent is undeniable. The Warriors were perfect for him. No pressure to be the go to scorer, and learning from Dray and Steph. He's just one of those guys that needs positive encouragement. Yeah he looks more engaged this season, but he still disappears from time to time. His revenge games always seem to be good. Looking forward to his revenge game against LeBron :D"
Andrew Wiggins also only missed one. The Warriors forced him to sit it out too since it didn‚Äôt matter.
Andrew Wiggins has a vert that‚Äôs two inches less than MJ. Everything you wanted in a basketball player physically he has
"I‚Äôve never given an Andrew Wiggins take around here. He had a solid season but, I mean, body of work. He‚Äôs been one of the worst contracts in the league. Even to this day, he‚Äôs getting maxed to be the third best (soon to be fourth best) player on a team that finished 6 games above .500.   He had a good season for sure. Credit where it‚Äôs due."
"Fuckers in this subreddit telling me, always on twitter- Andrew Wiggins ain‚Äôt bout this, Andrew Wiggins ain‚Äôt bout that. My boy a BD on fucking Jimmy Butler and them. He, he they say that baller don‚Äôt be putting in no work- SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y'all haters ain‚Äôt know shit! All ya motherfuckers talk about Andrew Wiggins ain‚Äôt no defender, Andrew Wiggins ain‚Äôt this, Andrew Wiggins a fake- SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y'all don‚Äôt believe in that playa. Y'all know that playa got caught with a ratchet, Shootin' threes and shit. 12-year olds been on this subreddit since fuckin, I don‚Äôt know when! Motherfuckers stop fuckin' playin' him like that. Them Wiggins savages out there. If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Andrew Wiggins, I‚Äôm fucking beating they ass! I‚Äôm not fucking playing no more. You know those haters role with Thibs and them."
"the raptors played the entire season on the road, pretty much all their best players got covid real bad and the ones that didn't got hurt seriously  the warriors had steph put up an historically great season for someone his age, and had andrew wiggins put up his bests across the board  you're mad the model didn't predict this?"
"I wrote this a while ago and haven't updated it, but Wiggins played like a superstar against the team that traded him and his hometown (CLE, TOR). He put up 65% TS on 19FGA, over 8 games, against the Cavs.  https://towardsdatascience.com/does-andrew-wiggins-have-an-effort-problem-a6a13c0337bb"
Andrew Wiggins redemption arc has been a pleasant surprise this season
"As a Laker fan pretty much fighting with other members of my sub about not sleeping on Wiggins for our play in game on Wednesday, I linked his [splits](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059319/andrew-wiggins) for the past 10 games.   I'm not taking this dude lightly, that's for sure. People say he's streaky, that may be the case but if we double Steph this dude is gonna be a problem."
Wtf is sportsnaut? Lakers have been leading in defensive rating all season.  &gt; Andrew Wiggins is just enough to make him work for his buckets  LOL
Stopped watching at ‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins who shows up sparingly.‚Äù Dude‚Äôs been great for us all year.
"Andrew Wiggins is not an ""average"" starter too though, he's a solid starter. An average starter has average defense and like 13PPG or something"
"https://sportsnaut.com/nba-defensive-rankings/  Top 1 defense? Get your facts straight before you blindly defend a team LMAO. And AD ahahhahahahaha Draymond's gonna make it difficult for him if AD isn't 100%. If I remember correctly, Lakers don't have an answer for Stephen Curry, who's gonna guard Curry?? Sure Lakers got LeBron but he's hobbling to the play-in and Andrew Wiggins is just enough to make him work for his buckets. Plus the dubs are playing the best basketball in the NBA as the regular season finished.  It should be fun to watch regardless and l wouldn't be surprised if the Lakers win but I definitely wouldn't bet against the Warriors rn so good luck with that."
I can't wait for an Andrew Wiggins playoff game explosion. I would want no part of the Dubs in the first round.
Jimmy butler gave Andrew wiggins depression
"We‚Äôve seen a different Andrew Wiggins this year: efficient, good three-point shooter, excellent defense. He‚Äôd be respected as a great 3 and D second or third option if he wasn‚Äôt hyped as ‚ÄúMaple Jordan‚Äù, given too big a role and a coaching/roster turnstile on the Wolves, and given a boat anchor of a contract.   Tangentially related, but if Ben Simmons was labeled a ‚Äúpoint forward‚Äù or ‚Äúpassing big man‚Äù, there‚Äôd be waayyy less talk about his shooting than if he‚Äôs labeled as a PG. Not saying it‚Äôd be a non-issue (Jokic/Bam/Sabonis all have a good mid-range game and some ability to hit outside shots), but fans wouldn‚Äôt be at his throat about it."
Andrew Wiggins slander is off limits this whole offseason
Andrew MOTHERFUCKING Wiggins
# I LOVE ANDREW WIGGINS!!
it will never cease to annoy me that national people/fans act like andrew wiggins is any different of a player than he was with the wolves. he's exactly the same! its the expectations that changed
Slightly off topic but I can not believe Andrew wiggins and kevon looney are only 26 and 25.
No.   But why is he scared of Andrew Wiggins?
"Can‚Äôt get something nobody was offering.   Trust me, I know Harden is worth more than what we got. Even Kevin Love got Andrew Wiggins back fresh off being picked number one and still had all that hype.   But nobody was offering a number one overall pick and every day we didn‚Äôt trade Harden at that point, better offers weren‚Äôt coming in. A better market never materialized.   Even the potential Simmons trade creates a team with a weird fit that is likely never better than a mid tier team."
"""The Grizzlies (37-33, same record as the Warriors) beat the Kings tonight, which means Sunday‚Äôs MEM-GSW game will determine which team finishes in 8th place, with the right to fly to the 7th place team‚Äôs homecourt and battle for the official No. 7 seed in the playoffs, probably on Tue 5/18 or Wed 5/19 (we think it will be Wednesday as that night is more desirable for the networks to have Stephen Curry on TV than Tuesday, but we‚Äôll see if there are other factors involved).      The loser of Sunday‚Äôs big Grizzlies-Warriors matchup would have to face the 10th seed, win that, then play the loser of the 7th- vs 8th-place game for the official No. 8 seed in the playoffs.      Tomorrow‚Äôs game for each team (MEM-SAC and NOP-GSW) is thereby actually meaningless because all combinations will result in the Sunday MEM-GSW matchup still deciding who finishes in 8th place, with the notation that the head-to-head series between them is currently knotted up at 1-1:      If GSW beats NOP and MEM beats SAC: both teams are 38-33 heading into MEM-GSW. Obviously the winner on Sunday would finish 39-33, good for 8th place and better than the loser‚Äôs 38-34 final record.      If GSW loses to NOP and MEM beats SAC, GSW is 37-34 and MEM is 38-33 heading into the final game. GSW winning that final game means both finish tied at 38-34, but GSW would obviously win the head-to-head tiebreaker at 2-1.      If GSW beats NOP and MEM loses to SAC, GSW is 38-33 and MEM is 37-34, and GSW would have to beat MEM to avoid a tie at 38-34, in which MEM would win the head-to-head tiebreaker, 2-1.      And it follows that if GSW loses to NOP and MEM loses to SAC, both teams would be 37-34 and the winner of Sunday would obviously finish with the better W-L record at 38-38 and in 8th place.      Because tomorrow‚Äôs game is therefore ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù, there is speculation that Steve Kerr will rest Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins, as they are all ‚Äúbanged up‚Äù (and Eric Paschall and Jordan Bell will be available)""      Courtesy of the Lets Go Warriors Youtube Channel"
MJ is a better version of the best Andrew Wiggins could ever be... So probably
That's some the way Andrew Wiggins walks shit.
"&gt;Andrew Wiggins says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know even know what ‚ÄòGladiator‚Äô is, I‚Äôve never heard of this movie.‚Äù The look on his face was like perplexed. Not anger, but just like get out of my face. So he just looks at us and says, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall go get ready for the game, man.‚Äù  Wait, who was giving the ""get out of my face"" look? KG or Wiggins? Makes a big difference in this story."
Andrew Wiggins has NEVER shot 40% from 3. not even once.
"When Draymond went on his rant defending Wiggins, I felt that he knew Andrew was going to get the vaccine or already got it. And he saw it as his job to vocally defend his teammate.  Cause there was no way Dray was gonna defend Andrew's right to negatively impact Steph,  Klay, and the whole team.  Totally different vibe for the Nets though. It seems like Nash and KD really have no idea what Kyire is thinking and are trying to get the message through in their comments that he should get the shot."
"‚ÄúYou see that hill over there? Yeah, I‚Äôm about to go die on that. Just watch this.‚Äù - Andrew Wiggins"
So he is Andrew Wiggins 2.0 because he is Canadian and any other reason?  Are all lefties only compared to lefties too?
Andrew Wiggins 2.0 sounds upset people are disrespecting his team that is below average. How dare they. Unacceptable.
"*Got removed for being a low effort post, so I will put it in the discussion thread.*  **It is ok not to max Ayton NOW, probably even the correct move. Same with all rookie contract players except superstars.**  The important thing is that this does not mean that Ayton will not play for the Suns on a max contract. It just means they aren't giving it to him a year early.      He has 1 more season before becoming an RFA. That means that in the 2022 offseason, the Suns have the ability to offer him more money than any other team, and the ability to match any other team's offer. His only way to get off the Suns, if he wants to, will be to take an immense financial risk by playing on the QO. Even if he does that, he still has to play with them in 2022-23.      So the incentive is really not there to offer him the max now.      **An example of why not to do it:** Andrew Wiggins signed a 5-year max extension after 3 seasons, but had a down 4th year and overall did not improve like the Wolves hoped.      **An example of a team not offering the max:** Kawhi Leonard won the 2014 Finals MVP in his 3rd season, but the Spurs did not extend him. The following offseason, he signed a 5-year max contract and stayed a Spur.      **An example of a team offering less and the player accepting it:** Giannis Antetokounmpo signed a 4-year extension at slightly below the max after his 3rd season."
"&gt;and ended up being one of the best to ever play the game  Yes, that's only the eyes of fans who appreciate his physical appearance. In terms of actual on court results? **He can shoot the ball. But, that is all**. Nothing else. He's 6'3"" but cannot run the halfcourt set as good as most nba PGs today. He's not athletic, so he cannot dominate on the offensive end like other 6'3"" players/Russell Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, etc. His defense is atrocious.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, when 2009 arrived. America was in a brand new place it'd never been in so the league-office got the urge to use the NBA for that symbolism of Pop Culture's love affair with Obama's election and therefore all humans with similar physical attributes as Obama.  Nonetheless, I love him as a person. Why? Because he sees the unfair, undeserved preferential treatment he receives for the past 6yrs ---*and he never EVER uses it to piss off other players like he can eeeeasily do*. Never.  He stays humble and unassuming, and it is truly a rarity. Most of all, whenever big media is being unfair to some melanin players \[Draymond, Wiseman, or Andrew Wiggins?\] then he always finds a way to just smile and make a public statement that subliminally/stealthily disagreed with how big media is handling said players."
"I don‚Äôt think people hate Andrew Wiggins. The vaccine stuff was dumb, of course, but besides that the worst thing he‚Äôs done is just be a kind of disappointing yet still good NBA player."
"Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins, and Kyrie Irving if by least popular you mean the most hated."
Thank you Andrew Wiggins for getting that shot.
How in character is it for Andrew Wiggins to think that playing in the NBA is something he‚Äôs just entitled to?   How many players have done less with as much talent as he has?
"Fuck I just took some for some back pain. There goes my chance at being the next LeBeon. I was really trending that way. I'm so stupid. I shouldn't have followed my doctor's suggestion, and instead done my own research, by listening to Andrew Wiggins."
"I understand holding out for a better deal-but is it worth sacrificing this season for? Surely Embiid won't be happy with that. I guess the difficulty is deciding what a shitty deal is. Hearing some of Moreys expectations for a trade sound pretty far fetched. I understand starting high and them agreeing to a middle ground...but he's been asking more than the AD or Harden trade...for a guy who's offence has basically regressed every year after his rookie season.    What was his request of the Warriors-  Andrew Wiggins,¬†James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders...   I just don't think this is a realistic asking price. If he's holding out for 4 years to get this kind of return? Jesus. Can't be good for the team spirit."
"‚ÄúChasing wins‚Äù yet collecting draft picks and expecting Andrew Wiggins to play a big role for a trio that‚Äôs aging and has had multiple injuries in the last 2 years.   Seems like the Warriors are done contending for now, they can just live of their dynasty legacy and as long as they remain more competitive than the post-1998 Bulls, they‚Äôll maintain that mainstream reputation the dynasty gave them."
"Of course OP didn't randomly say it for the fuck of it. OP said it because Wiggins mentioned his family, which his dad is a part of, is against vaccinations and OP found that to be odd since his father previously did cocaine.  (BTW I'm not agreeing that OP connecting cocaine use to vaccine stances necessarily makes sense)  The comment said:  ""His dad got suspended from the league for doing cocaine **but thinks** vaccines could be harmful to the body.""  Clearly, they were referring specifically to his dad's feelings on the vaccine and not his entire family - or Andrew himself.  It's a reach to make the assumption that OP was making a point about Andrew.   His dad played almost 400 NBA games - he's notable enough for people to have opinions on him specifically."
"The problem is if your not Vaccinated, they are mindfucking those who are into believing a every non vaccinated person has it or will end the earth. Facts. Read comments on all social media profiles , there is a shame to a point of a non vacc person is the end of the world. Hmm? That‚Äôs not having your own mind, your brainwashed. Sounds like fiction into reality‚Ä¶.   Edit-this post is about Andrew Wiggins.. my response was not, sorry I went somewhere else . Sorry Modulator"
"Wiggins mentioned that nobody in his family believes in vaccinations, so OP referenced his father. Clearly, they took issue with his father.  Saying that Andrew isn't his father isn't a good counter-point whatsoever. Like you said, his dad's cocaine use has nothing to do with Andrew whatsoever, so why even bring up Andrew in response?"
"Brought Andrew into the mix? I feel like I‚Äôm in the twilight zone. This post is about Andrew Wiggins, not his dad.   ‚ÄúOP‚Äù brought Andrew‚Äôs dad into the mix. He was trying to make a point: Andrew‚Äôs dad did cocaine, therefore Andrew‚Äôs family is filled with morons. The counter-point is ‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins isn‚Äôt his dad and didn‚Äôt do cocaine‚Äù. It‚Äôs a fair point. His dad‚Äôs cocaine use has literally nothing to do Andrew himself. If there was a valid point to be made about their moronic views about vaccines, that‚Äôs one thing. But the reference to cocaine is completely irrelevant to the conversation."
"Holy shit fuck that guy. The [ESPN article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32341148/warriors-andrew-wiggins-explains-decision-get-covid-19-vaccine-options-were-get-vaccinated-not-play-nba) is just a what's what of ignorant, harmful quackassery coming out of his mouth."
"Levert is an inaugural member of the Sneaky Old Club, alongside Pascal ""Older Than Andrew Wiggins"" Siakam and Dame ""Same Draft As Bradley Beal"" Lillard"
It‚Äôs more than that. Andrew Wiggins is an anti vax plague rat.
"Lakers superstar LeBron James recently said that it is everyone‚Äôs personal decision whether or not to get the vaccine. Those comments didn‚Äôt sit well with Abdul-Jabbar.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge fan of LeBron James, both as one of the greatest basketball players ever and as a humanitarian who cares about social injustice,‚Äù wrote Abdul-Jabbar on his Substack. I have written his praises many times in the past and undoubtedly will in the future. I admire him and have affection for him. But this time LeBron is just plain wrong ‚Äî and his being wrong could be deadly, especially to the Black community.‚Äù  James, 36, commended Golden State Warriors titan Draymond Green over a powerful statement he shared about the vaccine, which also promoted personal choice.  However, Abdul-Jabbar was not fond of James signing off on the comments from Green.  ‚ÄúAfter Golden State Warrior Andrew Wiggins received criticism for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine for personal reasons, his teammate Draymond Green said the public needs to ‚Äòhonor‚Äô that decision: ‚ÄòThere is something to be said for people‚Äôs concerns about something that‚Äôs being pressed so hard,‚Äô he stated,‚Äù wrote Abdul-Jabbar. ‚Äú‚ÄòWhy are you pressing this so hard? You have to honor people‚Äôs feelings and their own personal beliefs.‚Äô To which LeBron responded that he ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt have said it better myself.‚Äô Actually, it couldn‚Äôt have been said worse.  ‚ÄúOn the surface, it appears that Draymond and LeBron are arguing for the American ideal of individual freedom of choice. But they offer no arguments in support of it, nor do they define the limits of when one person‚Äôs choice is harmful to the community. They are merely shouting, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm for freedom.‚Äô We‚Äôre all for freedom, but not at the expense of others nor if it damages the country. That‚Äôs why we mandate seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, car insurance, education for our children. For example, seatbelt compliance is at 88% in the U.S., but that 12% that doesn‚Äôt comply results in 47% of car accident fatalities (17,000) and costs U.S. employers $5 billion a year, and those costs are passed on to us. They made the choice, but we survivors are left to deal with the grief and the price tag.‚Äù  The NBA icon also bashed Washington Wizards star Bradley Beal for his poor reasoning on not getting vaccinated. Abdul-Jabbar took the time to rip apart Green‚Äôs logic as well.  ‚ÄúThe only support for Draymond‚Äôs statement is his belief that when people ‚Äòpress hard‚Äô there‚Äôs something inherently wrong with their opinion,‚Äù wrote Abdul-Jabbar. ‚ÄúThere is no logic to that statement. If I press hard against institutional racism, if I press hard against police brutality, if I press hard against recent laws making it harder for minorities to vote, if I press hard against child porn, if I press hard in support of MeToo am I automatically wrong? On the contrary, the passion of those urging vaccines might suggest there‚Äôs some urgency to their opinion. That the situation is serious and we need to take immediate action to protect people. That thousands are dying every day, mostly among the unvaccinated. That the Black community, where vaccine hesitancy is high, are dying at a disproportionately higher rate than whites. That publicly talking about honoring opinions that contribute to their deaths is irresponsible.  ‚ÄúThe country also mandates against drunk driving, ‚Äòpressing hard‚Äô against the freedom to drive under the influence.  We do that because drunk driving kills 11,000 Americans every year and costs us more than $44 billion dollars. Vaccine deniers and those who want to ‚Äòhonor‚Äô them are like drunk drivers who are convinced they‚Äôre okay to drive. When they make it home without an accident, that means they were right. Until they aren‚Äôt. Which is why 97% of COVID deaths are among the unvaccinated.‚Äù  The 74-year-old closed out his piece by sharing a strong analogy, putting the onus on celebrities to help spearhead the rescue mission within the pandemic.  ‚ÄúI think of the situation like those old fire brigades when people stood in a line passing buckets of water to save their neighbor‚Äôs house from burning to the ground,‚Äù wrote Abdul-Jabbar. ‚ÄúMaybe some people were afraid to join the line. But when the town leaders joined in, it encouraged others to do their duty. Today‚Äôs celebrities and athletes are like those town leaders. You either join the line to save your neighbor‚Äôs home, or you stand by and let it burn because you don‚Äôt owe them anything.‚Äù  While Abdul-Jabbar is extremely adored in NBA circles by his colleagues, he may receive some flack for going against some of today‚Äôs faces of the league. He recently spoke about the possibility of James surpassing him on the all-time scoring list."
So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs irrelevant to this thread about Andrew Wiggins and his choice to get vaccinated?
Andrew Wiggins should be glad basketball worked out for him. Else he‚Äôd be licking windows
Last time I checked Andrew Wiggins isn‚Äôt his dad and didn‚Äôt do cocaine
Nobody is going to decide not to get vaccinated because of Andrew freaking Wiggins lmao
&gt;Nice bait. But let‚Äôs all forget Stephs teammates last season were legit G-League players. Harden had All Star caliber players and was coming off a WCF appearance after a 65-17 season.  Wrong steph actually had more all star caliber players than Harden. The top all star vote getter teammates for Harden was CP3 in 2019 who got 530k votes meanwhile for Curry the top vote getter was Andrew Wiggins who got 700k votes. So no Curry is the one who had better all star caliber players
"Not saying it‚Äôs not natural. But this is the same Andrew Wiggins who said earlier tonight that he doesn‚Äôt take any medicine and wants stuff to ‚Äúheal naturally‚Äù on its own. So, which is it? Using an EpiPen is not the same as having something heal naturally on its own.  Not to mention that an EpiPen doesn‚Äôt contain solely epinephrine."
Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins is now AndRNA Withins
"Andrew ""Vax In My Veins"" Wiggins"

"&gt;Money and image ARE everything to him.   I'd say choosing to forgo an 8 million dollar payment sort of throws that argument out the window.  Like he doesn't have a PR guy telling him his image is taking a hit?  &gt;I actually think the only thing to him.  Are you sure? Could you turn down 8 million? Could you handle the millions of people criticizing you on the internet?  If those things were the only thing that matters he would've caved by now.  Andrew Wiggins values money and image more, hence why he put his ""beliefs"" aside and took the vaccine. Ben Simmons hasn't -what do you think that means?  &gt;Being Australian doesn't change these values  Yeah...different people from different backgrounds never value different things? Come on man.  &gt;the son of a fairly ordinary overseas pro, brought up around yes men who crowned him young prince  You really want to hate this guy huh?   I'd imagine he triggers so many of the kids on this sub, which is why y'all keep taking shots at him.  I'm not saying he's right. But people don't just turn down 8 million unless they have a better reason (in their minds)  If all he valued was money and image he would be at camp playing the good soldier right now.  Wake up."
I dont care any more than I care about the average person who isn't vaccinated. Like I get it on a symbolic level that it looks bad that these athletes aren't vaccinated but they're so far separated from the average person that it doesn't really affect you and I anyway. The unvaccinated people in your direct social circle or daily interaction are way more important than if Andrew Wiggins or Kyrie Irving ever gets the shot.
Has anyone ever seen Harrison Barnes and Andrew Wiggins in the same room?
Andrew Wiggins
"It's a phenomenon I feel like I see quite a bit - Player A gets rated too highly, then a few people realize this and start rating him lower than the rest of the crowd and calling him overrated.  Then more people realize it, then more, until so many people have lowered their rating of that player that the ""crowd"" rating itself has dropped significantly - but people still call him overrated even though at this point you could argue he's underrated now.  I think Kuzma fits that pattern. Dwight Howard was a like that for a little while a few years back. I think DeRozen was another good example. Maybe Andrew Wiggins, Ricky Rubio. Examples from outside of basketball: Tony Romo, Coldplay, Leonardo Di Caprio who arguably had the same effect in the opposite direction too and went from overrated to underrated back to overrated, Erwin Rommel, Thomas Edison."
"Andrew Wiggins. Dude has some disgusting dunks, crazy fast first step, one of the sickest spin moves you‚Äôll see, a lethal euro step and his mid range game and post up game is very aesthetically pleasing (when the shots actually go in). Also he just moves like an athletic specimen with how springy and fast twitch all his movements are.  But yah, even if he‚Äôs a good player the reality of what he is leaves so much to be desired compared to his highlight reel and what he could/could‚Äôve been."
I Do Not Like Andrew Wiggins Any More
Kyrie is by far the most popular player of all the players who have not yet been vaccinated. Most NBA fans don‚Äôt care about the 10th man on the roster not being vaccinated because the 10th man on the roster does not have the same platform as the 7 time all-star on a championship favorite team.   You also must not have done much research before saying that Kyrie is the only one you see since Andrew Wiggins was also in headlines last week for not being vaccinated until he got the shot.   Are you sure that you‚Äôre not the groupie for jumping to defend Kyrie like that?
Pascal Siakam (27) is older than Andrew Wiggins (26)

"‚ÄúTonight i report to the American people and to the world, that the Unites States media and its army of internet trolls has conducted an operation that vaxxed and microchipped Andrew Wiggins. ‚Äú"
isnt mitchell wiggins andrew wiggins's dad
Paschal Siakam is a year older than Andrew Wiggins.
The Warriors want Andrew Wiggins to promise he'll get better after they give him the vax.
&gt; It was the money  I think that's a bit too specific. It's his entire career too. People keep talking about how much money he already has but he's just a kid. This would end his NBA career. I don't think Andrew Wiggins really needs to worry about money.
"Well you see it takes lot less research to figure out how much money you gonna loose. Unlike the research done by immunologist and virologist who spend significant portion of their life doing ah......you know, research. But then again most people doing their own research have better understanding about human immune system than scholars that have spent 5 years in grad school, 2 more years in post doc and who knows how many more years working in the field. Wiggins was about to do 5 years grad school for his research until more pressing matter of losing shit ton of money came to light. Unlike his vaccine research this one had concrete numerical  proof. The bottom line is this world lost future immunologist and vaccine specialist Andrew Wiggins. All because of some stupid vaccine policy we will never get Dr Wiggins, A."

"Noted epidemiology researcher Andrew Wiggins, after 1.5 years of tireless research, came to this conclusion: ‚ÄúDamn this covid shit is wild.‚Äù"
&gt;Who carried harder? Ben Simmons or Andrew Wiggins?  Most confusing thread title of 2021
Steph Curry. Legacy on the line. Can he drag Andrew Wiggins to a title? Instant top 10 if he can.
"Anthony Davis will get injured ten minutes into the season opener.  Andrew Wiggins will get vaxxed The nuggets will take brutal revenge on my Suns if we meet in the playoffs and Murray is back.  BKLN comes out of the east.  Zion will make the ASG again on a losing team again. Either Memphis or Charlotte will make the play-in  This will be Dames last season as a blazer after they blow it again.  MVP candidates in no order: Giannis, joker, KD, Steph, Bron, Trae, CP3, Embid"
"Easiest would be: Rim Running Center/Pure Scoring Wing. Examples of this are DeAndre Jordan in his prime, Andrew Wiggins. You basically have one job and other players can set it up for you.   Hardest would be point forward or all-around guard.   Examples of this are Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Scottie Pippen, James Harden.   You kinda have to be good-elite on multiple facets to be considered as effective."
"Andrew Wiggins. Anthony Bennett. Markelle Fultz. Andrew Bogut. Andrea Bargnani. Chris Webber. Kenyon Martin.   Those are some players that were drafted first that I do not recall the teams building around, though I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm wrong about a few guys here. To be fair, to only include first overall picks you very quickly start to get to before many of us watched basketball or were old enough to know what a basketball was, and definitely before players had such power and freedom to change teams."
"What happens if the Warriors go KGB Cold War on Andrew Wiggins and inject the vaccine into him with the point of an umbrella while he‚Äôs in line at the grocery store?  Does Wiggins be like ‚Äúshoot, you got me, well I guess I‚Äôll be at practice tomorrow‚Äù?  Do the stakes get upped for his second shot and it‚Äôs a game of cat and mouse and Andrew has hired bodyguards and the Warriors have to get creative‚Ä¶"
"&gt; This includes MANY #1 picks.   I'd go beyond that. It includes almost all #1 picks in recent history:  * 2013 - Anthony Bennett was never the priority over Kyrie, traded soon after * 2014 - Andrew Wiggins was immediately traded, and after Wiggins' first year, KAT was the priority * 2015 - KAT, an exception * 2016 - Ben Simmons, whose team has at least clearly tried to make him guy 1B and has consistently campaigned for him to win awards and tried to get him to step up and do more so he CAN be the priority * 2017 - Markelle Fultz, everyone knows this one * 2018 - Deandre Ayton, obviously behind Booker always * 2019 - Zion, duh * 2020 - Anthony Edwards, behind KAT  So, 8 #1 picks, only 2 of whom were the priority on their teams"
"Your treatment in the league is based on your production. If Simmons played like a no. 1 overall pick, he wouldn't have this probblem. In year 5 of the NBA, you shouldn't be expecting any special treatment based on your draft order when you were a teenager. Philly had a shorter leash for Fultz.  Rich Paul should understand this. Cleveland literally booted no. 1 picks Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins off the team so LeBron could have a homecoming. No one would argue Cleveland made a mistake not building around their high picks."
"That only works if the player is someone like harden or AD or is a quality player on team friendly contract.   Simmons isn‚Äôt turning a struggling mid seed playoff team into a contender and due to his asking price, trading for him automatically means you‚Äôre giving up assets. He‚Äôs also no longer viewed as a franchise cornerstone so any team trading away their star will most likely steer away.  Last season people thought the rockets were complete morons for not getting him as part of a harden trade, now he‚Äôs talked about like he‚Äôs just a better Andrew Wiggins.   I can‚Äôt see his value increasing."
"Ok but Kuzma actually did spend four years in college and graduated with a degree. It's part of the reason he looked like he could hang with Ingram and Lonzo his first few years in the league - he was significantly older than them.  Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon, and a few months younger than Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins, they were one-and-doners and he did four years at Utah."
Imagine compromising your basic human decency and conscience for Andrew fucking Wiggins lmao.
Andrew Wiggins shots are administered intranetly as a series of two doses three weeks apart.
Idk why you felt the need to say especially the black ones in a sub about a sports league that is (and this a guess) 95% black‚Ä¶.  If you google the Tuskegee experiment you will see why the media is going out of their way to differentiate African American vaccine skepticism with general conservative skepticism. Personally I don‚Äôt think the distinction matters as both of these types of skepticism are bad for society. But I bet someone here will attempt to logic out a reason why one type of vaccine skepticism is better than another  I think what‚Äôs craziest about all of this is that Andrew Wiggins is Canadian and the Canadians don‚Äôt have a history of abusing black people or people of African descent. There is a reason the Underground Railroad ended in Canada. If he was First Nations I would totally get it‚Ä¶.
"Andrew Wiggins, Trey Burke, MPJ"
"Lol. If this is your argument then you have no argument. I‚Äôm not going to bother even attempting to explain the differences between the two viruses... you know what you‚Äôre doing.  If you actually think you made a good point, ask yourself if Andrew Wiggins can walk into a crowded room, accidentally breathe in and contract HIV, walk into another room, and accidentally give everyone in that room HIV by just sharing the room with them."
"He literally could've just said   ""Y'know, Andrew (Wiggins) is a grown man who can make his own decisions, it's not up to me to force him to do anything he doesn't want to do. I can offer my advice, but that's it""   and stop right there.  comparing this shit to wife in labor and ranting on about 'murrica and ""freedom""... these guys are hilariously stupid."
"Based on their buzz John Wall and Andrew Wiggins. So much hype, I know now to take it all with a grain of salt. If these prognosticators were so gifted, they‚Äôd be in a draft war room, not spilling ink for ESPN."
"Kyrie Irving, Andrew Wiggins, and Bradley Beal are 3 of the top 25 highest paid players in the NBA and all 3 have been vocally anti vax"
"You will never get coronavirus from Andrew Wiggins. His decision almost certainly will never affect you. Who it does affect is unvaccinated individuals who he interacts with in a non-social distanced, unmasked setting. These are also all people who almost certainly consent to his presence and are fine with interacting with him whether he is vaccinated or not."
"&gt; It might convince members of the public to get vaccinated. This isn‚Äôt just about Andrew Wiggins,  okay, so this whole thing isn't about Wiggins anymore, you're saying this is about advertising the vaccines. You somehow believe that Draymond Green telling people ""everyone should get the vaccine"" in a Golden State Warriors press conference is going to convince anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists, ""personal-freedom"" libertarian/conservative to go get vaccinated.   i'm sorry, Draymond telling these people to ""please trust Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J"" isn't going to work out like you think it will. These are not issues that Draymond Green can solve, these are much bigger issues relating to a general distrust in the federal government after decades of austerity/means-testing/defunding of social programs, not to mention their distrust of big pharma as well.   To suggest Draymond isn't being a ""moral human being"" because of this is just laughable"
"It might convince members of the public to get vaccinated. This isn‚Äôt just about Andrew Wiggins, it‚Äôs about the message that Draymond sends with his platform that he has. I feel like that‚Äôs obvious‚Ä¶  Again, there are things that matter in this world aside from the chemistry in the Golden State locker room."
"if Andrew Wiggins is willing to take it this far and risk millions in losses over not taking the vaccine, what will draymond saying ""everyone should get vaccinated"" do?   in what way would that convince Wiggins to get the vax? How would it improve Wiggins relationship with the team? You have to remember, Draymond's main goal is to win (just as everyone on the team), so how does this benefit the team whatsoever?  If anything, it only benefits sports media clickbait journalists, who are just looking for drama. No other positive impact towards the team."
They‚Äôll say it‚Äôs because they care so much about others. And Andrew Wiggins not wanting a vaccine will kill people. That‚Äôs what they tell themselves and repeat back and forth to each other. But it‚Äôs really just a thin excuse to feel superior to an NBA player.   If you have a vaccine you are largely safe from a severe outcome. Someone not getting vaccinated will not affect you whatsoever. They know that. But admitting that takes all the fun out of sneering at others for being stupid and selfish.
"&gt; there are some things that are more important than team chemistry. Teams and players have a job to do, but they also have moral obligations just like everyone else.  &gt; using your platform to promote vaccines  In what way is it more important for Draymond to publicly call out his teammate, and potentially risk team chemistry even further? Draymond's #1 goal in the NBA is to win. He's not a legislator, he can't mandate people get the vaccine. He doesn't work for Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J, it's really not on him to be a vaccine evangelist.   Even if you look at this morally, he has no incentive to alienate his teammate even further than he already is. It would only hurt the team even more. As a vocal leader on the team, he has walk that tight rope. It's easy for us to sit on the sidelines and say ""hey draymond, why don't you call Andrew Wiggins irresponsible"" or some shit, but there's too many factors involved. Wiggins' contract is too hard to move, so they have to settle with him being on this team and work with him throughout the year.   Joel and Doc learned the hard way what happens when you alienate a player on your own team, your own team kills their own leverage in a potential trade scenario. And worst case, they may have to be stuck with a disgruntled player, a deteriorating asset on the team that they can't move."
Yeah I was gonna get vaccinated but after I heard what Andrew Wiggins had to say I decided against it
"Andrew Wiggins destroyed the Timberwolves and is now destroying America, despite being Canadian. I wish Biden can deport these anti vaxxers to Afghanistan so they can hang out with their true people: The Taliban"
"Bradley beal and andrew Wiggins should have zero influence on any aspect of most people's lifes.  then again, if those two remain the only people on the planet who dont get vaccinated, we could just blame covid on them, and the issue would be solved"
Jimmy was right about Andrew Wiggins all along. Dammit
"It‚Äôs things that can be measured but make a difference on and off the court. Things like how they lead a team, their mental toughness and ability to bounce back.   It‚Äôs how some guys can have all the talent, and athleticism in the world but can‚Äôt put it together. Think of what separates Vince Carter  from Kobe for example. Carter is an elite athlete that has  tons of talent but it‚Äôs very clear he lacks that drive and commitment to be great like Kobe did.   So just think of players that have insane tools to be great but seem to fall short or don‚Äôt live up to potential. Andrew Wiggins would be an example of someone who‚Äôs clearly lacking intangibles in some areas"
We can offer up one Andrew Wiggins.
"That‚Äôs a very simplistic and disingenuous way of putting it. Nobody ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt believe in science‚Äù, I don‚Äôt even really get what that‚Äôs supposed to mean. They disagree with what the science says.    I have a healthy distrust of government but like I said, I got the vaccine after initial skepticism.    To believe everyone who disagrees with you is so far gone as being beyond help is a very suspicious way of thinking.     But hey, we‚Äôre just two assholes on Reddit. This discussion carries as much weight as the opinion of Andrew Wiggins."
"He‚Äôs just making sure Andrew Wiggins is unsuspecting. He‚Äôll attack when least expected. Smart move, Draymond."
"Vaccine passports do transform society. It‚Äôs not the shot that‚Äôs extreme it‚Äôs the exclusion of people. And let me re-iterate, I trust the vaccines and their efficacy. I just don‚Äôt support mandating it. Everyone should get vaccinated, but no one should be forced. I think it allows a slippery slope of government overreach. That‚Äôs ‚Äòmy conspiracy‚Äô..  The government does not care about us. They will tell us what they want us to hear. They literally admitted lying to us to save masks and PPE for doctors and medical staff. Instead of being upfront with us like adults, they lied to us like children. They told us it would just be 2 weeks to slow the spread. They told us once you‚Äôre vaccinated you won‚Äôt have to worry. I‚Äôm sure they knew that was a lie, but they knew it would get a good turn out.. They told us that they don‚Äôt know how this pandemic started, but it couldn‚Äôt possibly be from the Wuhan lab that we fund (which is now a credible suspect, and is not a tin foil hat conspiracy..). They can tell us anything and then say ‚Äúwell this phenomenon is rapidly unfolding and we‚Äôre still learning‚Äù.    This is not just about these two rich guys Andrew Wiggins and Kyrie Irving. And it‚Äôs not just Trump supporters and anti-vaxxers that are against the mandate. I‚Äôm hard left. But I don‚Äôt co-sign every single thing the left wants. People need to be less tribal with politics. They shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to have an opinion because they‚Äôll sound like a liberal or sound like a conservative and don‚Äôt want to be labeled as such.   Also, I think there‚Äôs a far better solution than vaccine mandates, and we should have been working on it from the beginning. We should be investing billions into research for creating an accurate instant method of testing. The vaccinated can still spread it(and yes I know it‚Äôs a far lower percentage) so this would eliminate that vector."
I agree with you in principle that reddit needs to chill out. The league is 90% vaccinated lol. Even medical staffs have lower rates.  That said Andrew Wiggins is in a unique position where the season is coming up and he will games if he doesnt get it soon
"I want to include a quote from the stroy, to provide some context. David Aldridge is a great writer and generally speaking, voices support for players and progressive causes. So he's not simply doing an easy to write hit piece here.    ""It is not pleasant because Beal is a centered, thoughtful dude in a league full of look-at-me egomaniacs. It is not pleasant because Beal ‚Äî against all advice from many of his fellow NBA stars, and certainly all of you terry0873s out there ‚Äî has been ridiculously loyal to the team that drafted him, loyalty being in short supply just about everywhere these days, and not demanded a trade out of Washington. It is not pleasant because Beal is a smart and caring member of the community, who has been a benefactor for multiple classes of kids at the Ron Brown College Prep High School in Northeast, among myriad other local charitable endeavors. It is not pleasant because Beal and Natasha Cloud led their Wizards and Mystics teammates in marching for social justice in downtown D.C. in June 2020.  It is not pleasant because I don‚Äôt like calling out brothers that, otherwise, do the right thing almost all of the time, and are role models in the truest sense.  But he is wrong, the way Kyrie Irving and Andrew Wiggins are wrong, the way that the portion of the country that still, for varied reasons, refuses to get vaccinated, is wrong."""
Most talented team ever? Look at that roster man what were you expecting? Best player was Andrew Wiggins lmao
"&gt;But he is wrong, the way Kyrie Irving and Andrew Wiggins are wrong, the way that the portion of the country that still, for varied reasons, refuses to get vaccinated, is wrong.  Beal is worse than Wiggins and Irving because he was actively (and pompously) spouting misinformation about the vaccine at his press conference.  ""It's my choice"" is dumb, but ""the vaccine doesn't actually protect you"" is worse."
"I have been a Minnesota Vikings fan my whole life but their qb is an anti vaxxer and I‚Äôm actually pretty surprised how easy it‚Äôs been to drop the team completely.  I‚Äôm sure when they get a new guy in there things will change but for now I‚Äôm just done.  For gsw fans, to have those 3 guys, and that arena, and then have it sullied by Andrew fucking Wiggins‚Ä¶I‚Äôd be apoplectic."
I find myself both annoyed and super interested in all the vaccine posts. ‚ÄúOh here we go another post...Andrew Wiggins said what?!‚Äù
"Passing to who exactly most of the wolves guys were injured last year and there‚Äôs no way he takes any of the 2018 or 19 pre deadline wolves anywhere. Jokic doesn‚Äôt make Jeff Teague, Andrew Wiggins, and Noah vonleh a playoff team"
"Yeah it seems like there is a unity in not disclosing vaccination status as to not ""out"" or scrutinize your unvaxxed teammates. It's frustrating but not surprising in a field that is so rooted in trust and teamwork.  This is why players like Bogdan, CJ or Kareem who have called out anti-vaxxers and been pro-vaccine have been great. Who tf cares about hurting anti-vaxxers feelings. Make them feel shitty and like morons because thats what they are. None of these guys saying ""they want to do their own research"" are doing anything other than googling and finding the first source that confirms their bias. They aren't reeding peer reviewed articles, they aren't conversing with Virologists or Scientists. As a researcher who has worked alongside the TRACE-Covid-19 project it's infuriating to see folks like Trey Burke or Andrew Wiggins say they need to do research and proceed to share anti-vaccine click bait from social media and ignore tested science results."
"That‚Äôs one aspect of it, but I honestly think some of the anti-vaxxers aren‚Äôt even looking at their trashy Facebook misinformation when they say ‚ÄúI need to do research‚Äù.   I think many of them, especially these NBA players aren‚Äôt doing any information seeking AT ALL. It‚Äôs literally just an excuse to maintain their preconceived skepticism and avoid the question, while trying to come off as having an intellectual basis for it.  Like ‚ÄúI need to do more research‚Äù for Andrew Wiggins probably doesn‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúI need to check out more anti-vax Facebook pages‚Äù. I think it means ‚ÄúGo away so I can play 2k and not think about the vaccine or COVID at all until the next time y‚Äôall ask me about it‚Äù"
"&gt;Nah, Wiggins is only endangering others if 1) he's proven to have the virus and/or 2) he intentionally attempts to transmit the contents of his body to a separate person beyond what is reasonably avoidable.  &gt;Furthermore, since both vaccinated and unvaccinated people can transmit the virus, your statement runs into a circular dilemma where everyone else would also ""endangering"" Wiggins by participating in society.  Terrible logic AND science on display here. First of all, no, Wiggins is endangering others as long as he is walking around in public, going into enclosed spaces, interacting with others, etc.   People who are unvaccinated are more likely to host and transfer the virus to others. So your science doesn't stand up. More importantly, if he does get sick, he runs the risk of occupying ICU space that could have gone to someone else. Look at some red states where people who dont have COVID are dying due to lack of available care.  Yes, vaccinated people are at risk of transferring the virus. But as I mentioned, it's a lower chance. Sober people can crash cars, but we still mandate that drunk people not get behind the wheel because we view one as a reasonable risk and the other as an unreasonable risk. So, yeah, you're wrong lol.   &gt;I firmly reject that the vast majority of population groups agree with you, as almost all states have more relaxed laws regarding Covid than San Francisco/California.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/13/poll-finds-bidens-vaccine-mandates-broadly-popular-despite-gop-outcry/?sh=4d6c73292355  &gt;an infringement on one's fundamental rights to free movement, association, assemble, etc...  I don't think you understand... nobody has those rights if you're not a part of the community. Rights are a product of human association. Obviously, in a state of nature, rights do not exist because there are no laws!   &gt;take on these arguments because I disagree that public health is more important that the rights of individuals to act in their own, self-determined best interest (even if I personally believe them to be making bad choices).  So basically, my life is less important to you than Andrew Wiggins' ability to not get vaccinated because he doesn't feel like it. Got it. Really cool of you! I'm not going to reply any more because I don't want to waste my energy convincing a libertarian that lives are more important than your freedom to be a dipshit, so bye."

I have yet to hear a solid argument against taking the vaccine. I could give a shit less what percentage of players aren't vaccinated.  But when you have idiots like kyrie and andrew Wiggins in the league it starts to shed some light.   Woops well it doesnt help that African americans look to these public figures for cues and see them being skeptical as well for no reason.
Andrew Wiggins will forfeit $15.8 million this season if he refuses to get vaccinated.  Kyrie Irving will forfeit $17.5 million if he chooses not to get vaccinated.
andrew wiggins gets almost 30 mil a year. Look at it as 15 mil to take the shot. I bet any regular anti vax person would take the shot for 15 million.
We will give ya one unvaccinated Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins: ‚ÄúYes! Yes! This will get him!‚Äù
Honestly starting to feel like the ‚ÄúI got the vaccine but am not expecting others to‚Äù statement creates more issues than the Andrew Wiggins route when it comes to empowering other to pretend they‚Äôre virologists.
"&gt; I think it's more of overpaid players are getting bought out.   No. If these players had any value to the team buying them out they'd still be under contract. The team is still paying them most of the money and taking the cap hit. They just have no need for them. So they do it for the player and a tiny bit of money savings. There are plenty of players like Harrison Barnes, D-Lo or Andrew Wiggins that are overpaid but will never be bought out. They have some value to their teams even if it's not what they're worth."
Iggins Wiggins of Andrew
Andrew Wiggins fucking ruined my ability to love
"Lebron has guys like Caruso, Kuzma, KCP, Dennis Schroder, Gasol, and even Matthews is decent   Green has Kelly Oubre, Andrew wiggins, Steph Curry, James Wiseman etc.   One team has much better defensive personnel than the other."
"He's still got Andrew Wiggins, Kelly, and Draymond. Stop making excuses for him. They gave him D'Lo. That didn't work. They tried signing Giannis. That didn't work. The owner said they are light years ahead of the league. They were always a great TEAM before KD joined. Their motto was Strength in Numbers. They had a great bench. They sold their souls when they got KD. Stop."
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year ‚Äî and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 ‚Äî they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"Paul George every year : 2 months at a near MVP level, Andrew Wiggins the rest of the season"
Andrew Wiggins: 17/5/2 on 55.8% TS%  Trent: 15/2/2 ok 55.2% TS%  Thanks for proving my point that this Warriors roster is easily better than what Dames had.
Give Lebron or any of those guys Andrew fucking Wiggins as their 2nd best offensive option and see what happens
"Oh yeah, forgot about that stretch without CP3.   I would argue though that Kerr puts the handbreak on Steph and doesn't allow him to play like Harden/Dame and spam PnRs all day because he's tied to his motion offense and using Steph off-ball, even though that's probably not the best way to maximize this group of players, that lacks the passing and IQ to play that style. You can't do the motion offense with Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre instead of Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston.   Would love to see Steph play under MDA and be given free reign to do whatever he wants."
"&gt; This current team would be just as bad as last year  Lolllll it's hilarious how disingenuous you're being instead of making the actual argument that is there for Curry. Sad.      Players that started the most games for you last year:   Glenn Robinson 48 games, Draymond Green 43 games, Willie Cauley Stein 37 games, Damion Lee 36 games, DLO 33 games, Eric Paschall 26 games  DEFINITELY the same team. Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre same as Glenn Robinson and WCS, no?  Not even considering that Draymond Green literally didn't try last year."
Andrew Wiggins 2.0 Guys
That‚Äôs a nice long ass defense you have about nothing that was said.  I love Wiggins but nothing the dude above you said wasn‚Äôt true and you did nothing to prove him wrong.   No one is saying he couldn‚Äôt dunk.  Congrats on the highlights.  His mentality and drive was and is an issue.  That‚Äôs a fact. Lmao and talk about highlights but Andrew is what he is and ant minimum ant has the potential to be better.  But f
"&gt; Team A has four solid shooters   What? John Wall, Zion &amp; AD are all paint scorers first. Andrew Wiggins has league average TS% as well. The only ""solid"" shooter (40% from 3) is Kyrie.

"""My birthday gift to Steph, even though I know it's not as good as feet."" - Andrew Wiggins"
Andrew Wiggins - Brilliant but lazy
Idk but I saw a take once that Luka was just Andrew Wiggins but with white privilege seriously
"Amazing:   * Curry with 32/6/9 on his 33rd bday. Just needed 1 more point my man  * Andrew Wiggins 28/3/2 - all he needed was a few day's rest! Looking fresh post-ASB  * Poole - 18/3 in 22 minutes - this guy could turn into 6MOY next season. Oozes scoring potential.   Great:   * Draymond 11/12/12 - still hopeless offensively but actually hitting a few shots now. Still anchoring the D. Keep doing your thing man   * Nico 5/2/2 in 12 minutes. Showed very promising flashes of talent as a pass-first PG who can hit his shots when needed. Good D already. Just turned 20 today! Cool that both PGs have the same Bday  * Wiseman 16/3 in 23 minutes.  Still lots to work on but he looks better than he did earlier in the year. Desperately needs to learn to rebound against grown men though. And to box out. And to set better screens.   Good:   * Eric Paschall: 9/3/1 in 12 minutes. Put his limited time to work. Such a reliable bench scorer already. Defense needs to keep improving though  * Looney: 2/3 in 11 minutes. You do all the little things bb, I wont complain.   Alright:   * Oubre 7/7/1 in 30 minutes. Deferred on offense today, and probably a good idea. Not his best night at the office but still played good D and never turned the ball over  * Bazemore: 3/1/1 - plays his role off the bench  * Juan Toscano-Anderson 0/2/0 in 11 minutes. Still trying to figure it out consistently. I think he has the tools to be a goo contributor  Fuck off:   * Brad Wanamaker - 0/0/0 in 0 minutes. No offense, you are so trash. Part of the reason we won is because you're on the end of the bench now. 20 year old Nico is a better backup PG. Go play overseas homie.   Good win today! Most exciting ball we've played in a long time. Guess we really needed the ASB rest. We're still in playoff contention y'all. We Believe"

"One Acronym. Sure, he doesn't have the highest knowledge of the game as this moment. You can teach X and O. Does he learn and improve...yes. That is proven in the 83 games he has played. Learning to switch, play defense. He's gotten better. You can't teach 6'10"" and shoot 50/42/80.   And if BBIQ was all it took to be a superstar...you would have a whole different league.   I also love Mavs fan downvoting me because I said MPJ could be at the same level as Luka. Why does this statement trigger people. I'm not taking away Luka's talent. Why people so hurt by that?   Its not far fetched, I'm not talking about some random nobdy.

Then you have names like LeBron, Kevin Love, Dwight, Jrue, Beal, Simmons, Tatum, KAT. They predict more superstars then they don't. And in this case, I don't think it missed on MPJ. Yes, the circumstance is different in what he had to go through but the only thing holding him back was...his back. He has proven that his back doesn't hinder him shooting at an elite level against NBA competition."

"Enough assets? We are getting 1 pick and a bad rookie. Andrew Wiggins no matter how well he is playing, shouldn‚Äôt be considered valued now after how bad he‚Äôs been for so long, gotta see more of him. Also, there‚Äôs a center prospect in this draft that is a much better fit next to Zion than wiseman. This trade is horrible for us. We got 4 first for Holiday so we‚Äôd need at least 4 here and we‚Äôd need another player."
"We need more lmao. We are trading an all star and our best defender for a bad rookie, Andrew fucking Wiggins and a pick isn‚Äôt even gonna convert this year. We are getting fucking shafted."
"1. Why would the pelicans trade two elite floor spacers and elite young prospects for Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.  Wiggins is not even in the same realm of value of BI and Wiseman still has a chance to be bust. Even then both would fail at defense-as they would be relied more on offense and wouldn‚Äôt have the system in Golden State along with draymond   2. Steph Curry is putting up his 2016 stats and this warriors team still gets blown out due to the supporting cast, why would the pelicans want that.  3. There‚Äôs a portionable chance that the pick doesn‚Äôt convert and honestly the wolves have been fucked over by injuries. If they stay healthy and add a 2021 top 3 prospect I don‚Äôt know how valuable that pick is."
You are straight up idiot Jesus üòÇ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving up my shot at a generational talent on a 4 year rookie contract so I can get my ass kicked by the clippers first round. Hopefully Andrew Fucking Wiggins develops at 27 guys!‚Äù
"Went from playing with Giannis, LeBron, Jokic, Dame and Luka to Kent Bazemore and Andrew Wiggins in 4 days..that'll make anyone mad"
"I hope there‚Äôs an in depth post on Edwards soon. A lot of people, admittedly myself included, thought he‚Äôd be an Andrew Wiggins type bust because of a couple rough pre draft interviews where he said he didn‚Äôt like basketball all that much. He always had, and always will have skill, and he‚Äôs clearly going to be more than Wiggins barring injuries. What‚Äôs his ceiling though? Could he be an All NBA talent?"
"Also some obvious picks don't pan out as well and aren't actually obvious picks in hindsight, i.e. the Andrew Bogut vs Marvin Williams for #1 pick in 2005, Michael Beasley and Derrick Williams at #2, Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014, Jahlil Okafor in 2016, etc."
"An idea I had that gained some traction yesterday was this. It assumes the Clippers flame out in the playoffs and Kawhi doesn't want to re-sign.   Warriors get:   * Kawhi Leonard  * Ivika Zubac  Clippers get:   * Andrew Wiggins  * James Wiseman  * Minnesota 2021 1st  * Warriors 2023, 2025 1sts  * Warriors 2022, 2024 pick swaps  Clippers could trade PG and other pieces for loads of pick and jump start a rebuild overnight.   Meanwhile the Warriors run Curry/Klay/Kawhi/Draymond/Zubac with Lee, Oubre, Paschall, JTA, and Looney off the bench. That's a great 10 man rotation and an easy finals contender  I don't have the 2027 1st or a 2026 pick swap in the Warriors offer since it would be a situation where Kawhi/Warriors have leverage over the Clippers, so I don't know if giving that extra value would be needed. But they could be included if need be"
"Yeah looking at the complete picture, I see a player on the Suns that has the clear designated role of top facilitator. Booker has always done more playmaking than Mitchell over his career, he just isn't asked to do as much this year but is still putting up decent playmaking numbers.   Even ignoring that, the difference in assist numbers is pretty small. The difference between 5% TS is pretty huge and outweighs the rebounding and assist edge for Mitchell. That's the same gap as Lebron and Andrew Wiggins for comparison.   Also I never claimed that either player primarily valued as JUST scorers but primarily valued as MAINLY a scorer. Neither player is the lead facilitator on the team or a significant defensive presence."
Pg: Stephen Curry Sg: Kelly Oubre Jr SF: Andrew Wiggins Pf: Draymond Green C: Kevon Looney
"This is really dope, great work.   OBVIOUSLY this is outside the parameters of your studying, but it's important to at least think about the idea of trades in my opinion. A few recent examples that come to mind; the Lakers. AD was not drafted by LAL, but Lonzo, Ingram, Hart and those dudes were. These guys (aside from Hart) were top picks that led to them getting a guy that gave them a title, so that would influence the value of tanking. Similar as well to Cleveland, trading Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love, granted I'm not sure anyone thinks that K Love was anything but the 3rd best player on that team, so I guess that's also out of your parameters but point still stands. Not sure they win that title and make those runs without K Love. That would be tons of extra work though and sometimes would be too much of a tangled mess, so I'm on board with your idea. I just think it's also important to note the idea of trades."
"C is definitely first, but the next 2 are hard. Probably take A over B in a single game because of the scoring, but would take B for a series. B has better defense and doesn't have Andrew Wiggins."
I live like 5 minutes away from the highschool Andrew Wiggins went to in Canada. So prob him
"**TEAM CANADA**  After the success of the Toronto Raptors franchise, Canada finally earns a second team again, and unites a cast of all-Canadian players to fill it with their Maple Leaf pride.  Quickly, the team proves to be more than a gimmick. In fact, they fit together well. Lead guards Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander prove to be a good tandem, given Murray's ability to shoot and score and SGA's ability to slash and his size to guard bigger guards. The two both average 20 PPG on the year, nearing All-Star status.  The rest of the team is a mixed bag. Andrew Wiggins has big moments here and there, but Lu Dort appears outmatched for most power forwards given his limited size. Chris Boucher holds his own down low and nears the league -lead for blocks, but has some issues staying out of foul trouble over the course of starters minutes.  Overall, the team flies around .500 all season long, and fights for a playoff spot. Unfortunately, the league stuck them in the Western Conference to split them from Toronto, causing them to barely miss out with a 40-42 total record."
They just need another shooter out there to punish teams for loading up on Curry. Park Klay on the weak side and all of a sudden if you trap it's a quick pass to Draymond and it's a lot different helping off of Kelly Oubre or Andrew Wiggins and helping off of Klay Thompson.   I just hope Klay comes back like his old self.
Andrew Wiggins
"but the fact that you think ""him being able to try on defense"" is a situational thing and not ""an andrew wiggins thing"" proves my whole point yet again. he picks and chooses when to try. that isn't the medias fault."
Andrew Wiggins comes to mind
"Timberwolves are the standard franchise with an immense winning history in every decade since the 50s  Andrew Wiggins is the ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù who has been the greatest since he was picked 1st overall   Karl Malone has set a standard for being a model citizen and a civil rights activist, also a champion"
Andrew Wiggins.
"&gt;Sprewell was a multiple time All-Star back in the 90s but given today‚Äôs analytics movement and the fact he wasn‚Äôt super efficient nor was he a good team player, he might be like similar to say an Andrew Wiggins today.  Spree was way better then Wiggins. Dude was an elite defender in the league and was arguable one of the best two way guards during the 90s. He even made an all nba first team. People look down on his career because of him choking pj and his need to feed his kids, but the guy was an amazing all around player."
"Allen Houston would have been a better fit in today‚Äôs game (Houston was a 40% career 3 point shooter and a solid defender and a good teammate). So Houston would be a legit starter in today‚Äôs game.   Sprewell was a multiple time All-Star back in the 90s but given today‚Äôs analytics movement and the fact he wasn‚Äôt super efficient nor was he a good team player, he might be like similar to say an Andrew Wiggins today."
Ok and? Whenever my team is on national t.v.we are getting butt raped by lebron or KD national is where the most regular season pressure is at if ur team can perform in those moments u got a good team clearly my Warriors choke alot and ur blazers win alot in those games  Now pls answer this how Steph has practically the same stats but with less wins hmm because steph's teammates arent doing as good of a job as Dames teamates when it comes to winning a game ur acting like steph's second best player right now is Klay no we got iggins wiggins of fucking andrew dropping a nice 17 a game shooting 35 percent from three on 5 attempts per game If u gave me the chance I'm trading Andrew for Gary in a heart beat hell if u throw in a first for next year I'll take Carmelos small contract making 38 percent from three over 40 mil to drop 17  Also I think it's time to stop calling us Bandwagons we are not even making the playoffs according to alot of the NBA if anyone's a band wagon its whoever left the warriors after last year I'm sticking with this team till my Skull dissolves from reality itself and you can quote me on that
Andrew Wiggins
"&gt;U do realize he spent ages 21 to end of his career with a minimum of an Achilles tear right? By 23 he tore both Achilles. I‚Äôm not even gonna mention all the other injuries, any lower body injury u think off he prob got. Portland doctor says X-ray alone gave him a handicap parking pass at age 30.  And you realize that Portland does not have wizards who can prevent all those injuries from occurring, right?  Of all teams, in all sports, Portland has the worst record with keeping players healthy.  &gt;So lemme get the straight. He avg 16/10/3 while playing the best defense on lakers Shaq then anyone in the league.    You have a habit of playing a little fast and loose with the facts.  In their first playoff meeting, in 1997, O'Neal went for 33/9/3 on 53% in a four game series.  32 year-old Sabonis had 11/7/2 on 43% shooting.  The following season, in another four game Laker victory, O'Neal had 29/12/4 on 65% shooting versus Sabonis' 12/8/2 on 45%.  The season after that, Portland didn't face Los Angeles, but they got swept in four by San Antonio with Robinson and Duncan posting 18/9/3 and 17/10/2 respectively, both on over 52%.  Sabonis had 10/7/3 on 33% shooting.  In 2000, Portland again met the Lakers, and O'Neal had 26/12/4 on 54% versus Sabonis' 8/6 on 38%.  This is the 7-game series where you claim that Sabonis was the best or second-best player on Portland -- but he was 5th in points, and 3rd in rebounds, and 4th in assists, and 4th in minutes, and 9th in FG%, so that's more than a little questionable.  34 year-old Scottie Pippen grabbed almost twice as many rebounds as Sabonis in that series.  &gt; So with all this, and his obvious skillset of being an elite passer   Still absolutely zero of evidence of this alleged elite skill.  &gt; He never had all these qualities in the nba and still avg 16/10/3 for a whole season.   A lot of players have had one season that matches that.  Kevin Willis had four seasons better than that -- some in his early thirties just like Sabonis -- and he's a one-time All-star despite playing 20 years.  &gt;Use this and ur common sense to tell me how 10-20% of Portland Sabonis we saw doesn‚Äôt dominate the game.   If we saw only 20% of Sabonis, then younger Sabonis would've been posting Chamberlain-like numbers.  He never did.  What happened in the 1982 World Championships?  Sabonis was a couple months shy of 18, but barely good enough to even play -- only managing garbage-time minutes in 5 blowouts.  When, exactly, did Sabonis  turn from bench-warmer into greatest player ever?  And it's not like that Soviet team were the Globetrotters.  They won gold, in a 1-point final win over the US -- a US team whose best players were Doc Rivers and Andrew Wiggins' dad.   The aforementioned 1992 Olympics were, by far, the best of Sabonis international career, and we saw the competition that was against, and it was extremely underwhelming.  &gt; These blazers teams were stacked and u add an all time great player like Sabonis.   If he ever was an all-time great, why didn't he play like one?  In the 1983 European Championships, Sabonis averaged 18 points, while his team went 6-1.  Sabonis had 26 and fouled-out in the loss to Spain.  In the '84 Olympic qualifiers, he averaged 15.3 per game against Finland, Ireland, Sweden, Israel, Greece, Germany, and Spain.  None of these games were particularly close, so maybe the Soviets were resting him... but that's problematic for your theory that they overworked him into injury.  So again, ya cain't have it both ways.  In the '85 European Championships, he averaged 20 against losing to Spain and again scoring 26 in the loss.  Against lesser competition, he did better, posting 36 against Italy -- but also 6 points against Poland, 10 against Romania, and 14 against France.  So again, when, exactly, did Sabonis become an all-time great?  There's nothing in his record of International or club play to support that claim."
&gt;But it's becoming more and more likely that we're looking at his near-ceiling as a player and he's not gonna be worth wat his contract demands.  Does Andrew Wiggins even like to hoop? I remember before he got to the league how hype I was for him. Armchair reddit opinion but I wonder what being traded as the #1 pick by/for Lebron did to his motivation and psyche
Not idiotic when so far I've been right.  I said the same thing about Andrew Wiggins his rookie year when he was getting hype for averaging 20 and got completely shit on for it. Inefficient volume scorers with no defense or playmaking are a dime a dozen  Meanwhile guys that can pass at an elite level with ball handling and shooting abilities are where the NBA is moving - hence why ball was the obvious pick
"Last year your top 5 in minutes played was Eric Paschall, Glenn Robinson, Damion Lee, Alec Burkes, and Jordan Poole   This year it is Andrew Wiggins, Steph Curry, Kelly Oubre, Draymond Green, and Damion Lee"
I mean Steph Curry has Andrew Wiggins looking like a good basketball player.
"Eric Snow was never a scorer, he was a great defender. The entire Cavs was built around as a defensive core around LeBron, they were ranked 14th in the NBA in defense rating.   &gt; THE WARRIORS HAVE BEST DEFENDER IN HISTORY, #1 PICK ROY ANDREW WIGGINS, #2 PICK JAMES WISEMAN  Lmao at a Cavs fan calling Draymond the best defender in history in 2021, yall weren't saying shit when you begged for his suspension in game 5 and said it made no differene. Wiggins was RoY and still plays like a rookie. Wiseman has the worst net rating of any starter in the NBA and you're selling the shit out of everyone else.   &gt; Kent Bazemore, mulder, and Smailagic are the only warriors on the cavs level.    Seriously? What shit are you smoking because none of those guys except Bazemore are even NBA ready players.   &gt; Steph has a on/off of +9.0, LeBron (at age 22) was at +10.4.   Look at starting lineups not involving Wiseman and Steph's on/off is in reality more like +15.   &gt; LeBron led the league in BPM, VORP, and only was second to MVP Dirk when they won 60+ games   We still looking at BPM and VORP in 2021? It's a box based stat that awards people who fill out the box stats, it literally measures defense as an accumulation of steals, blocks, and rebounds and thinks Westbrook is a historically good defender.   Also funny how that works doesn't it, LeBron finished 4th in the weak Eastern conference and came 2nd in mvp voting."
"And who did jokic have? Jamal Murray, Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap, MPJ. Jamal mUrray is the perfect guard to go alongside jokic. KAT's best teammate ever was andrew wiggins. Twolves have failed to build around towns, which is why we have only made the playoffs once."
"larry hughes got hurt and played 30 games, calling Z an all-star in the center depleted eastern conference is just malpractice, Brad Miller was an all star that year too, eric snow was 34 years old in 2006 averaging 4.0(!) ppg as a starter, and drew gooden is the epitome of replacement level big   THE WARRIORS HAVE BEST DEFENDER IN HISTORY, #1 PICK ROY ANDREW WIGGINS, #2 PICK JAMES WISEMAN, oubre who just scored 20 a game last year, eric paschal who was first team rookie last year, and kevon looney has minutes as a starter in the NBA finals  really, Kent Bazemore, mulder, and Smailagic are the only warriors on the cavs level.   warriors have other guys averaging 18.5, 15.2, 1..7, and 10.2    Steph has a on/off of +9.0, LeBron (at age 22) was at +10.4.   LeBron led the league in BPM, VORP, and only was second to MVP Dirk when they won 60+ games   curry really isn‚Äôt even close"
"PLEASE don't call Andrew ""2-Way Wiggs"" ""Poutine Pippen"" ""Maple Jordan"" Wiggins a bum. There will be no Maple slander here."
"He‚Äôs putting up the same stats as his 2016 season, that‚Äôs enough of a criteria. Also being that without him his team is the worst in the nba with Andrew Fucking Wiggins as his second option"
Draymond Green is ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù one of the best defenders of this generation and ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù one of the best all around players in the league. Kelly Ubre is absolutely no scrub. Andrew Wiggins is a good two way player. Sorry I can‚Äôt agree with you. Lebron on that team is top three in East OR West.
Harden had Westbrook/CP3. Steph has Andrew Wiggins lmao
"Ppl act like Curry is all by himself which I don‚Äôt understand. The warriors have their entire roster minus Klay.. they SHOULD be a playoff team.   Andrew Wiggins is averaging over 18ppg shooting 39% from 3 and playing good defense. He reinvented himself into a borderline all-star player again. Draymond won DPOY and is the primary facilitator for the team. Curry is the goat shooter. Throw in some good role players and you‚Äôd think you have yourself a decent team. Who would ever think the following would be under 500?  Stephen Curry, Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, Wiseman, Poole"
Iggins Wiggins of Andrew
Andrew Wiggins
Legit second option is a stretch. A legit second option for a team with championship inspirations is not andrew wiggins
"Don't forget the power of friendship  Andrew Wiggins has no friends, confirmed"
"It‚Äôs not a comeback, just an observation that tickled me. I never expected to see a full-blown Stan account for Andrew Wiggins in 2021.   And your ‚Äúcounters‚Äù are mostly just opinions dressed up as facts (or woeful misreadings of other people‚Äôs arguments). No one is saying Wiggins hasn‚Äôt gotten better at all. The argument is that he‚Äôs gotten a bit better, but it‚Äôs not nearly as drastic as others claim. He‚Äôs a solid player now, and is clearly a better fit in this role (i.e. someone who isn‚Äôt asked to be the primary perimeter creator). I like Wiggins and want him to succeed, but I think it‚Äôs funny how much members of this sub did a 180 on him as soon as he went from Minnesota to Golden State."
"Damn dude, do you literally JUST post about how good Andrew Wiggins is? Your post history is 100% Wiggins content across multiple subs.  That‚Äôs just weird... and this is coming from someone whose username is Andy_Wiggins."
Anthony Edwards is what Andrew Wiggins was supposed to be.
"Shoutout to Lavin, the athletic all-star multi-time dunk champ who‚Äôs scoring 25 PPG now on the Bulls after T-wolves moved him for andrew wiggins who also isn‚Äôt on the team no more!"
So he was worse offensively than Andrew Wiggins.
"Fucking thank you. Aside from going 8-15 for 22 points, Wiggins played well on both ends. Tatum went thermonuclear but Wiggins defended a lot of those shots about as well as possible without fouling. And Draymond absolutely had him wide open in the corner on both those fake handoff drives, with Andrew having already splashed from there in the 4th."
Ja Morant will have the Andrew Wiggins career trajectory
"Lebron carried that team for 15 games without AD. Draymond Green is an all star defender and facilitator. Andrew Wiggins is a ‚Äúg-leaguer‚Äù?!? Oh and they have the top rookie center. That team isn‚Äôt g-leaguers man. Currys been hot yea, but don‚Äôt shrug off James."
curry doing all this with andrew wiggins being his best 3 point shooter oh my god
22.Ayton Desmond bane Jimmy Butler Richaun Holmes Caris LeVert Khris Middleton Larry Nance Otto Porter Cam Reddish Matisse Thybulle Andrew Wiggins not many stars but good ass players
"Jimmy definitely didn't do the right thing here, but how did he beat the first string T-Wolves with the third-stringers? I feel like if he was really as frustrated as it seemed in Minnesota, then this was a softer outcome. Imagine if his maybe-dad MJ was in the same situation. Andrew Wiggins would just be a stain on the practice court. KAT defo isn't soft though, because he showed more maturity than Jimmy at that point in time"
"&gt;s he looked amazing but that was disregarded because ‚Äúlow sample size‚Äù  Because this happens every single year in the NBA all the time. Fans overreact to cherry picked sample sizes, overrate their own young prospects, are convinced ""their guy is making the leap and if you disagree it means you dont watch the games"" etc. Im not referring to you specifically just in general. People are still bringing up Cam Reddish's 20 game splits late last year as proof he'll be some kind of stud. People did this type of stuff with Andrew Wiggins everytime he had a good 3 week stretch for years. Hell even saw some of it with Josh Jackson. It's all just motivated reasoning.   &gt;He wasn‚Äôt going to be successful on a Lebron team because he‚Äôs more of a ball dominant player.   He was a very popular preseason most improved player pick for that season. Even by Lakers fans. This is hindsight bias.   &gt;for how we have something wrong with our development.  Lonzo, Ingram, Randle, Nance all these guys have magically become substantially better 3 point shooters, nonetheless players once they left LA. Even Russell from a player perspective. If it were just one example I wouldnt bring it up as anything but it's not some arbitrary isolated coincidence."
"[He said more than that](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2800185-jimmy-butler-reportedly-insulted-karl-anthony-towns-andrew-wiggins-they-soft)  Maybe he wasnt as blunt to the public or the media.   But he did say they (KAT and Wiggins) ain't shit and that theyre soft, at practice."
"Idk which Wiggins you are talking about being inconsistent, but it certainly isn't Andrew Wiggins lmfao. There's a reason people joke about his 17ppg. It's cause he ALWAYS gets there no matter what. Mans may have 5 points in the first half but will close the game on 17/18 points."
"As a Frenchman, one of the few games I've seen in Target Center was to see Andrew Wiggins pop off start of 2019-2020 season against the Heat and this was beautiful to watch."
"&gt;Stephen Curry &amp; Andrew Wiggins ‚Äì 2,487 pts  Kwame Brown and Kobe Bryant combined to score 84 points on January 22, 2006."
I guess Andrew Wiggins is westbrook too.
That‚Äôs so simplistic lmao. You think Andrew Wiggins is a better offensive player than CP3? Because he‚Äôs scoring more ppg
"Ops, Stephen Curry and Andrew Wiggins are able to make to this list. So inspirational."
not really. was already gone when they beat them in miami last year. also missed one of their wins against them the year before. games he did play he was very much andrew wiggins
I just want to go on the public record to say Andrew Wiggins will play a crucial role on a championship team.   After this contract is up he‚Äôs going to be a 20 ppg scorer in his prime with 100 mill in the bank. He‚Äôs going to sign a reasonable deal on a title contender and be an amazing 4th option.
Andrew Wiggins had an interesting habit of playing mediocre all season but going god mode against the heat
Andrew fucking wiggins is enough salary to match any all star lol
[Andrew Wiggins: I want to be on the Cavs for my entire car‚Äî-wait where is Lebron trading me to?](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WigglyUnlawfulIzuthrush-size_restricted.gif)
People think Siakam is Andrew Wiggins level of overpaid. Its actually insane.
They literally just did a podcast called 'Reassessing the 2020 Trade Deadline' in which Hollinger admitted he was wrong about the D'Angelo Russell - Andrew Wiggins trade.  https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/262189/Hollinger-Duncan-Reassessing-the-2020-Trade-Deadline
"Honestly, no. I WAS at Oracle when he dropped that halfcourt game winner though, that was fucking crazy. I have nothing but respect for Harden's scoring ability, but IMHO he had a better coach and GM who actually looked for players to compliment him instead of sticking him in a motion offense next to Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, and James Wiseman.  Harden is a fucking killer tho, people love to hate because of the ft's but they forget that's how Kobe and MJ and all ISO scorers since the dawn of basketball have feasted. I also fucking love Harden's shot profile, too. The fact that we got to see arguably the two best scoring backcourt players since MJ go head to head year after year is truly a blessing."
"Uh no, is andrew wiggins yours?"
"&gt; They need a strong wing  Andrew Wiggins.  &gt; a capable guard for bench  Like who, who's getting paid what Wiseman is?  &gt;  and of course a Center.  So... Wiseman?"
"I‚Äôm a big believer that most rumored trades are that .. just rumors. False stuff getting leaked to make teams either look more desperate or to make it look like a team tried when they didn‚Äôt really. At the end of the day I try to tell myself if a rumored trade that didn‚Äôt go through has me thinking, ‚Äúwhy wouldn‚Äôt they accept that?‚Äù I tend to tell myself it probably was never on the table. That being said some that come to mind -  - Kyrie to the Wolves for Andrew Wiggins. This was right after the Wolves got Jimmy. I actually think Kyrie and Jimmy would of been a really good back court, especially with KAT as a pick and roll big with a great low post presence. I don‚Äôt think the Wolves were ready to give up on Wiggs yet at the time though.  - Jimmy for 4 first round picks to the Wolves. I feel like this one wasn‚Äôt all that it was cracked up to be. They only leaked that the Wolves turned down 4 first rounders but not the potential protections the Rockets might of put on them. That being said Jimmy with that specific Rockets team might of been enough to get them past the Warriors.  - Lakers trading Dwight Howard to the Clippers for Blake Griffen and DeAndre Jordan. This one was really wild for me. I remember thinking there was no possible way this was on the table because it seemed like the Lakers were fleecing the Clippers but I remember watching them tear apart the Lakers on First Take for not accepting the offer the minute it was sent TO THEM and talking as if there were already legit talks between the teams about the trade. That being said idk how reliable Skip and Stephen A are when they report on stuff so I still think it might of not been true. Would of been wild though."
Andrew Wiggins against OKC
"A few exceptions doesn't mean we need to make bad teams take flyers on Andrew Wiggins' of the world.  Trae wasn't winning, Luka would have missed 1 year, Zion isn't winning either.  Also, how sweet would Luka vs Trae have been in the G-League for a title?"
Ja Morant is the new Andrew Wiggins
"Andrew Wiggins 3 point %  Maybe its just recency bias, but he can knock them down from time to time sure but he really doesnt feel like a high 30% shooting guy if that makes sense  Like he was bricking wide open 3s against the wizards the other night and went 0-4 iirc"
Andrew Wiggins.
"The Nets sent Russel, Napier, and Graham Warriors sent Durant (sign and trade) and a 2nd round pick 2025.    The Warriors sent Napier, Graham and cash considerations to Minnesota for cap space.     The Warriors then flipped Russel, Spellman, Evans for Andrew Wiggins, 2021 top 3 protected 1st round pick and 2021 2nd round pick.   Durant didn‚Äôt need to do a sign and trade and could have declined the offer from the Warriors. However by doing so he got the Warriors valuables assets."
"Yup.   If Embiid ever figures out his health problems, we're all in trouble.   Here's a fun comparison of career minutes played in the NBA.   * Andrew Wiggins - 18606 * Joel Embiid - 7943"
"He has some good takes. Once in a while he'd say really well-rounded opinions about players and teams. He's not too pessimistic nor is he a homer for any team so he usually sounds like an unbiased analyst.   But then he turns around and says the most blatantly bullshit  thing he could say. I mean really, a player who we know of more as a facilitator and a rim- runner; a player so utterly garbage at the three point line we wished he would stop chucking,  is better for a team that already has Draymond Green, and doesn't have any scoring option other than Andrew Wiggins and an utterly cold, completely tunnel visioned Kelly Oubre? Like how the fuck could you say this with a straight face?   As great as Westbrook is, that Warriors team is never made for a #1 option that couldn't shoot even if his life depended on it. Even silly nephews like us know that was a terrible take."
"He's a Ring another ring a FMVP and MVP away from Top 10 but I would get murdered for saying that, not gonna happen anyways cause Curry has Maybe Two More Years of 34 Minutes of playing Catch up before his Ankles Give out.   and it would take a KD Recovery From Klay a Big Jump From Wiseman and Andrew Wiggins being a God Level Third Option if we want any chance to come out the West.   But in All Honesty I wish we had more Cap Space because we really are a Star-Superstar Level Player Away from being Well Suited for the Playoffs Particularly a Big with Rim Protection, like Bam or Myles Turner or Even a Clint could help us but I think they are all under Contract"
Andrew Wiggins and Bradley Beal too
"Andrew Wiggins, after signing the max-extention, did not care anymore about winning for a couple of seasons."
Andrew Wiggins
Lmfao let's see him play with Andrew Wiggins instead of James Harden how about
"the last year he was healthy, they won 36 games where the leaders in games started were: Andrew Wiggins (at his worst arguably), Taj Gibson, Josh Okogie, Jeff Teague, Dario Saric, and Tyus Jones.   he was +11 in on/off last year.   the growth in his passing is what has prompted me to believe this really. i really think he is in a tier of his own after Jokic. KAT can do just about everything at a high level on the offensive end"
"I don‚Äôt blame anyone for being concerned for the Wolves. Just when it seemed like they were finally on track, they skid off the road and Andrew Wiggins dunks on KAT.   I hope they succeed, but at this point, you look to Towns and wonder what‚Äôs up when he‚Äôs played with KG, he had a co star with Jimmy, he got his friend DLo, and they have a top young star."
So he‚Äôs just like Andrew Wiggins except that instead of 15 he scores 25 in his sleep and then dips
"I was expecting way more, considering how many awards this post has lol.   ‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins dunks around* KAT‚Äù"
"&gt; Westbrook has a higher ceiling but also a lower floor  More like higher floor lower ceiling but its Wiggs. He's consistently good on D and scores 17 points unless he plays teams he hates like the Wolves and OKC.   At this point we know who Westbrook is, he's consistently inconsistent. There will be some games like tonight where he puts up a triple double on godlike efficiency and most of the games he goes 2nd gear passes it to Kyle Singler's ghost to the 2nd row. If I was a fan of a team and this guy plays for us, I'd be extremely pissed off with how he plays. Think Kelly Oubre as the first option but with playmaking.  Andrew Wiggins is much more efficient from 3 and is played on a leash and now plays better defense than he did in Minny"

"No no, Kyrie isn't an MVP level player. He never became an MVP level player. But he is absolutely an MVP level talent. MVP level player is someone like Dame, who absolutely could have been MVP in several seasons but he played at the same time as some of the best players to ever touch a basketball. MVP level talent is someone who has all the raw talent to be the best player in the game but never obtained all of the skills needed to fulfill his potential. That is why I worded it so specifically. Let me explain myself a bit better since I'm sure I'm confusing you somewhat. We'll use the same examples.   Dame for instance has most of the skills (insane scorer, solid enough playmaker, not a complete hole on defense), most of the intangibles (leadership, clutch as fuck) and the required stats year after year. But he never had a great enough team around him to suceed enough to be the MVP, and his entire career has been spent playing in the same timeline that 3 Top 15/Top 20 players of all time play(ed). That makes him an MVP level player. Meaning he could have won it but outside factors were against him.  Kyrie also has many of the skills (great scorer, best dribbler to ever play the game) but lacks some important intangibles, primarily leadership. Which he had a chance to learn from one of the best leaders in basketball history. But he wanted to quench the sword before he forged it, and all he has done since the LeBron years was disappoint two franchises by giving 0 and less than 0 effort respectively. He never fulfilled his potential and that possibly cost him a spot among the greatest. He is a flower that tried to bloom before he grew from the ground and ended up rotting. I hope I'm proven wrong sooner rather than later because I really like the guy and want to see him at his best (especially since he is technically in his prime rn) but as they say, hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. I'm not saying he didn't work hard enough on his game, just saying that he should have worked much harder on some other things that matter a lot when you want to be one of the best to ever do it. It may end up making him nothing more than a footnote in the story of basketball.  Let me make another example on a smaller scale. Let's go with Allstar level player vs AllStar level talent. Similar thing but on a ***much much*** lower scale.  Disregarding Mike Conleys last years appearance, he was never an AllStar before. He had the stats, he had the skills, he had the success, he was just always somewhat outclassed by his peers. He wasn't ""not good enough"", more like his peers were ""better than good enough"". Even if he never made an AllStar appearance (once again, lets pretend he wasn't one last year), he was still always an AllStar caliber player.  On the other hand, Andrew Wiggins. All the skill is basically there. All the talent he could have ever hoped for. But he never fulfilled his potential. He never tried hard enough, worked hard enough, never DID enough to be on that level. He is an AllStar caliber talent for sure, but at this pace he'll be lucky to even be considered a snub one day, let alone get picked. I again hope I'm proven wrong but it sadly looks like I'm not.  I hope I made sense lmao."
"RJ Barrett, who I just imagine is in the Harrison Barnes and Andrew Wiggins mold."
"I want to preface this by saying I don't want to trade Myles at all. That being said, I like the idea of Andrew Wiggins and Moses Moody was who I originally wanted us to draft.

Duarte and Wiggins would help cover up Sabonis defensively, plus we'd have some young guys with potential in Moody and Jackson."

"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

"Andrew Wiggins only needs 6 more points to complete his daily quest of 16 points per game. Now Warriors fans should pray he completes it with just 2 shots, make his shooting night 6/13, 2/5 from 3.   But with his pace right now he will shoot 7-8 more shots to get his 6 points."
"For a smart team, very low. For a bad team, a player like Andrew Wiggins and a top 3 protected first"
"I really cant stand watching Andrew Wiggins, i feel lile theres never any urgency with him lile he doesnt care if he wins or not. I might be biased though, I had such high hopes for him."
Jonas Valenciunas  Would‚Äôve lost all my money on Andrew Wiggins. Was so hyped for him.
Andrew Wiggins
"I don't think many people realize the situation he inherited in Minnesota:   1. His dad Flip drafted KAT and Zach Lavine, traded for Andrew Wiggins and built a very solid young core. Go watch highlights of some of our games from Flips last year + Sam Mitchell's year (the season after Flip died) and there was a lot of potential there. We beat the Warriors at Oracle during their 73-9 season and you could just tell something was clicking. Wolves fans had **never** experienced what it was like to have a promising ""Big 3"" like that before. I still would take that core over Dlo/Edwards/KAT today.   2. Thibs came in and blew it all up. He traded Lavine, restructured the roster, the environment, brought in Jimmy, changed Wiggins' role (Flip was very open and calculated in his development of Wiggins, and I think he knew that he had to use Wiggs in a very specific way) and Thibs basically just put Wiggs in the corner and had Jimmy run point forward.   3. After the Thibs + Jimmy experiment, things are blown up again. Wiggins' confidence is shot, he was a completely different player before Thibs. KAT is no longer the younger confident guy, his head is starting to get bigger and he's starting to get treated like the cornerstone of the franchis. Ryan was handed the keys to a very unstable and unremarkable roster and overall situation.   4. I still think the blowing up of the original 3 of KAT-Wiggins-Lavine + Rubio was a mistake and one good season under Thibs doesn't erase that. Once Thibs and Jimmy left, we really didn't have anything positive to work with. Ryan was never going to win a lot of games with that roster.   Lastly, I don't think Ryan is a championship coach, but he's not a bad coach. Players in both MN and DC have all said amazing things about him. KG has always loved him. He's not great but he's also not an inept ""daddy's boy"" that only got the job due to nepotism."
Do the 2021-22 Warriors have the record for most NBA sons?  * Steph - Dell Curry (1986-2002) * Klay - Mychal Thompson (1978-1991) * Andrew - Mitchell Wiggins (1983-1987; 1989-1992) * Gary II - Gary Payton (1990-2007)
"Late bloomer, huh? Did he work out with Curry in the off season? Did he get Lasik? What the fuck is going on here? The Bucks and Lakers look terrible. The Warriors have done a total 180 since last year with Andrew freaking Wiggins plugged in nicely. Odd season so far."
"Not only he is basically traded for Kevin Durant, he is still Andrew Wiggins on 33 million dollar a year contract, and the Warriors are fine with that because it works decently enough for them to have a pretty ok player as their 4th max contract. Just like a year ago they were ready to pay something like 80 million dollars for one year of Kelly Oubre. Cause unlike most teams, luxury tax seems a minor inconvenience for them. I'm not sure what is the ""natural"" narrative about them exactly."
Ayton has a bit of Andrew Wiggins symdrome.
"Imagine the GOAT, Andrew Wiggins decides to average 40/5/5 in the finals to win FMVP and Curry misses his chance again, that would be comical."
"Yeah, technically you weren't wrong when you said Curry's most consistent offensive help was gonna be Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole. But you probably could have named off the rest of the roster too."
...TIL that Andrew Wiggins' dad was an NBA player
"Ehh... Choosing a raw kid who MIGHT be good in the future over win-now players like Lowry and Caruso screams LeGM?  What exactly WOULDNT scream LeGM to you then?  Lol this is pretty much the complete opposite of a LeGM move when you refuse to include Talen Horton-Tucker of all people into a trade for another allstar.  LeGM definitely throws THT into that trade without a second thought!   Kidding,  LeBron is definitely known for keeping young players around over an extra star or win-now vets.    Maybe we should get Cavaliers legend Andrew Wiggins throughts on the matter though"
Never forget Andrew Wiggins securing the max due to promising the Wolves he would stay in the gym long and work harder
"I remember hearing that Harrison Barnes dunked in sixth grade, and that Westbrook was a senior in high school. Late bloomer  Here‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins at 13 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ47CuHVFvA&amp;feature=youtu.be"
"A revived Andrew Wiggins, Mody Mooses, Kuminga, Wiseman, and several picks for Dame and salary filler vets. Full rebuild for Portland and Golden State goes all in on Steph's prime with an Oakland native."
Its the andrew wiggins special
"RJ is the far better player but that is because his strengths in terms of skills right now far out way Cam‚Äôs . Talent in my mind is basically what you can‚Äôt teach, Cam is a more fluid athlete, more coordinated, has more natural instinct . He just can‚Äôt really bring it together or do one thing well enough to be a great.   Some of the most talented players in the NBA aren‚Äôt that good. People are confusing talent with overall ability and making it seem like I am saying he is as good as RJ.   Talent is just natural ability such as athleticism, coordination, instincts , not your skill level.   Dennis Smith Jr. - talented - shit player  Andrew Wiggins - talented - not as good as a lot of players far less talented.  Jason ‚Äúwhite Chocolate‚Äùwilliams -talented-not that good.   Kwame Brown"
"I‚Äôm still not sure how many of his games you actually watched when he was at Kansas, and I don‚Äôt mean that as an attack. Unless you‚Äôre a Kansas fan, I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd watch him night in and night out. But that view of him just‚Ä¶I dunno, man. It seems like it‚Äôs filtered through an awful lot of hindsight as he‚Äôs struggled to make the transition in the League. For example, your description of his success on the break being due to pure athleticism - Kansas has had better pure athletes at his position in recent memory. Mostly notably Andrew Wiggins and Ben McLemore. Neither of those guys were close to as good on the break as Josh, because he instinctively understood the value of spacing and had the feel for when to give it up and when to take it himself.  If anything, I think his natural understanding of the game was so good he seems to have had a hard time adjusting to NBA schemes and playbooks, because so much of what needed to be coached before he just did naturally. His mistakes on the floor now often look like the mistakes of a guy who is thinking too much instead of just trying to play basketball.  Just my opinion tho."
"There is not a single #1 pick on the roster wtf you talking about.  This isn't the pre-Lebron Cavs where they got Kyrie, Anthony Bennet (LoL), and Andrew Wiggins.  On top of that, the Cavs also had Lauri (starter), Okoro (Key sub), and Love (SUPER SUPRISINGLY KEY SUB) out this game.  I do agree the foul call on the Garland drive was a little sus, but happy it worked out for us."
Ant is just a confident Andrew Wiggins and dlo sucks the fact y‚Äôall think anyone of that team is untouchable is hilarious. And cause y‚Äôall spent the entire summer trolling now y‚Äôall got your karma
Andrew Wiggins makes me sad
A post on the warriors reddit started this off with Andrew Wiggins. That's when I knew we wouldn't be able to get him
laughing at aaron rodgers too. And bradley beal. and andrew wiggins.
"he doesn't have a single skill that is even close to elite  it's kind of funny because he was traded for Andrew Wiggins who I would describe in exactly the same way, but Wiggins' positive aspects are rarer and more valuable than Russell's"
This is a perfect example of how stats don't show context.   Anthony Edwards is high motor player with limited basketball/shooting skills. Andrew Wiggins is a skilled player with poor motivation and work ethic. It's a lot more frustrating to watch a skilled player settle for 19 foot jump shots or go periods of the game without even touching the ball than a player who is going 100% all the time but not capitalizing on open shots or making basketball mistakes.  So AE will ideally improve as he puts more time into his basketball skills. Similar to a guy like Giannis in his rookie/early years.  But Wiggins was NBA ready since high school and was expected to hit the league at a top level. There's not much you can coach or work on with someone who doesn't want to put the effort in.
2016 Andrew Wiggins dunking and using that spin move helped me get through some dark times in my life
&gt;Incompetent? We wanted to re-sign him with his bird rights so we could keep the core of the team intact instead of trading away 2-3 starters that summer so Butler could get his max.  if only there was some other way to have maxed him without gutting the team  \*stares at andrew wiggins' contract\*
"the best bad player on a max contract is Andrew Wiggins, so at least we have that going for us"
I'm crying how do u have this big of a hate boner for Andrew Wiggins of all people. Also Wiggin 2 way play is just more valuable to the warriors compared to Damien Lee
Andrew Wiggins: But I'm here....
"Nah his ceiling was to be the next Lebron James.  He literally has all the tools to be that right now.  But he lacks the mental fortitude and killer instinct required, kinda like Andrew Wiggins."
"Right, just ask perennially all-stars MCW, Tyreke Evans and Andrew Wiggins."
"Draymond is under contract for two years and then has a player option worth about $27.6 million, which is probably more than what Draymond would be getting by then. Draymond will be 34 years old by the end of his current contract + player option.  The Warriors do however have a lot of FA decisions at the end of 2023-24 which includes the end of Draymond‚Äôs player option year, as well as the end of Klay Thompson and James Wiseman‚Äôs contracts. But Klay and Draymond will both turn 34 by then, which probably enables the Warriors to pay both him and Klay an amount they‚Äôll be okay with. (And could also enable Poole and Wiseman‚Äôs new extensions)  The fact that Andrew Wiggins and Klay‚Äôs new contracts (if it happens) will most likely be less than their current ones also enables the Warriors to further pay Draymond a sufficient amount. Even if the Warriors decide to extend Jordan Poole and Wiseman, add in the fact that the new TV deal is probably going to extend the salary cap and Lacob is capable of paying a ridiculous amount of luxury tax. Draymond will probably get the money he desires unless he wants $30+ million a year."
"Andrew wiggins was on near lebron hype approaching the draft. Len Bias could have been anything, the Goat, a scrub, or most likely, just a standard nba player. Why don‚Äôt we stick to players we know balled out"
"I'm optimistic, but I'm not sold on any offensive option on this team other than Steph. Jordan Poole is being way too overhyped, Andrew Wiggins is not reliable in crunch time. Otto is a good role player, nothing more. Andre is still playing well, can't hit a shot though. Draymond is playing a lot better this year, but I still cringe every time he shoots.   We're heading into close games with Steph's brother-in-law (Damion Lee) as our second-best offensive option, and that's just not gonna cut it. We absolutely need Klay back healthy, playing at least at 80% of what he used to."
&gt; Curry took a team with Andrew Wiggins and what amounted to a G League roster to the play in last year  Curry is a two MVP winner two time champion and is one of the best shooters ever. This ain't a comparison you should use.
Players have dragged teams to the second round with less  Curry took a team with Andrew Wiggins and what amounted to a G League roster to the play in last year
"2 recent ones for the wolves:      1.) The trade that sent Zach Lavine to chicago in return for Jimmy Butler was originally going to send Andrew Wiggins instead, until Glen Taylor decided to get involved, and forced thibs to trade lavine instead.      2.) When Kyrie was requesting a trade from the cavs in 2017, he had 4 listed preferred landing spots. One of these four, believe it or not, was Minnesota"
just andrew wiggins him
"Gravity is basically when someone gets the attention of multiple defenders both on and off the ball. Steph and Kobe are probably the 2 most significant players in the last 20 years to have the most gravity from my point of view. Steph basically got the Kobe treatment last year, when hardly anyone on his team could consistently make plays for themselves or amongst themselves. Kobe had it much worse from 2004-2007 tho since his teammates around that time couldn't make consistent plays for themselves. Last year Steph at least had Andrew ""death, taxes, 17 points"" Wiggins."
"Klay's defense works 1-4 because his is so strong in his lower body (was?)     Klay would match up with the best player from the other team unless it was the center, much like Andrew Wiggins does now.     Watch guys like Kevin Love trying to back Klay down in the post and getting pushed out 2-3 feet at a time."
Dude looks like Twolves Max non-green shoe Andrew Wiggins. Absolutely disgraceful start
You have to but you‚Äôre going to end up with a lot of bad contracts like Andrew Wiggins. Most likely untradable.
Paul George   He gets disrespected like he‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins even though he‚Äôs been a top 10 (arguably top 5 during some years) and completely redeemed himself going back to the start of last season
Andrew Wiggins without a doubt
"Sort of hard to calculate it in bulk since the 2019-2020 season messes everything up and you have to modify it by hand depending on how many games their team platyed... but so far it looks like:  Buddy Hield and Joe Ingles with 99% of available games played, T.J. McConnell with 97%, and Andrew Wiggins with 96%. Then a bunch around 95% like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jordan Clarkson, Damian Lillard, and Harrison Barnes."
"For those curious, here's the debut game from the last ten #1 overall picks:  Name | PTS | AST | REB | STL | BLK | FG | FGA | 3P | 3PA | FT | FTA | MP ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Kyrie Irving | 6 | 7 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 12 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 26:01 Anthony Davis | 21 | 0 | 7 | 1 | 1 | 6 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 9 | 29:04 Anthony Bennett | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 14:59 Andrew Wiggins | 6 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 18:33 Karl-Anthony Towns | 14 | 1 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 31:53 Ben Simmons | 18 | 5 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 34:40 Markelle Fultz | 10 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 17:54 Deandre Ayton | 18 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 1 | 8 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 36:29 Zion Williamson | 22 | 3 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 11 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 18:18 Anthony Edwards | 15 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 12 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 25:09  Nothing too crazy. Simmons and Ayton both had great games. I feel like Zions was the most memorable though, 22 points in 18 minutes, 4/4 on threes, even though the Pelicans lost that was still a fun game. Oh and on that note: Edwards, Ayton, Towns, and Bennett all won their debut. Fultz, Simmons, Wiggins, Davis, Irving, and like I said Zion all lost their debut.  ^^^hopefully ^^^there ^^^aren't ^^^any ^^^mistakes ^^^in ^^^there"
"I mean‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt do well against big boys in the paint on either end. That‚Äôs the biggest one. In a shockingly competent looking move, we‚Äôve got Allen for them.   He‚Äôs loose with the ball, that‚Äôs a little tricky at times but you‚Äôd expect that from any rookie, let alone a 7 footer.   And from there you just wonder how he‚Äôll develop. Does he get more secure? Bulk up? Add some dribble drive? Or does he coast on what he‚Äôs got (see Wiggins, Andrew)? But if he puts in the work, he‚Äôs got every single tool to be KG/Bosh level sooner rather than later."
"Wow as if Andrew Wiggins never existed, huh?"
Andrew Wiggins FMVP
"Miles Bridges, Andrew Wiggins."
"Insanity is thinking that Wiggins is anywhere close to Pascal.         Pascal is a top 3 player on a championship team, and has made allstar and allnba as the lead player on a team with a top 3.            Andrew is still one of the worst contracts in the league.           The reason you are giving up 7th, 14th, Wiseman and Wiggins is that there is zero guarantee any of these assets would ever become as good of a player as Pascal."
"Jaylen Brown, Andrew Wiggins type."
"Alright here‚Äôs a fun, never gonna happen but would be cool hot take: The Bulls, no matter what off-season they have, will not come out of the east this year with the nets, bucks, 6ers, heat, etc built the way they are this year. I love em but it‚Äôs just not happening. Knowing and accepting this opens a crazy door.   Bulls receive:  4th OVR (TOR)  7th OVR (GSW)  James Wiseman  Gary Trent (S&amp;T)  Raptors receive:  Zach Lavine Andrew Wiggins 14th OVR (GSW)  Warriors receive: OG Anunoby Nicola Vucevic  This gives the bulls the perfect opportunity to start a super charged rebuild featuring White, Trent jr, PAW and wiseman + the 4th and 7th pick  This gives the Raptors a bonafide chance to compete in the east (this is where I‚Äôll take the most hate), but FVV, Lavine, Wiggins, Siakam coached by Nick Nurse has a chance to compete in the east IMO. 14 is also a nice compensation all considered.   For the warriors it is the perfect last chance at the classic dynasty to compete. OG is the perfect wing in that offence and VUC is the perfect centre. They‚Äôd be well over the luxury tax but that team will still make money if competing.   Thank you for coming to my Ted talk."
"The Myles Turner and TJ Warren trade for the 7th pick, Andrew Wiggins and Wiseman or something similar. I think both teams would benefit without breaking up their core roster."
"&gt;The subject was defense in the NBA, and Michael Jordan was speaking, although more about offense, especially his. We know few defenses could do anything about that.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;But there was one that might be bothersome, the zone defense. It was the topic du jour at last month's All-Star Game, and Jordan was making an impassioned plea before the competition committee that had gathered to consider rules changes to enliven the NBA game. Jordan spoke passionately. **If teams were able to play zone defenses, he said, he never would have had the career he did.**  Jorfraud would be Andrew Wiggins in the modern NBA."
"I don't think anyone's writing him off, but you have to remember that NBA teams don't really have players, they have contracts (at least from the team building perspective, which is what we're talking about here).  Reddish is on a rookie deal now where his pay exceeds his production and is likely to continue to do so, but he has immense athletic potential, which is why he was drafted where he was despite being terrible at Duke.  He's going to be up for an extension soon, likely before he even gets a chance to meet his potential (injuries, which you use as an excuse, are a red flag... hurt for 3 years?).  Reddish's next contract will likely exceed his production because guys with his pedigree tend to get overpaid - Harrison Barnes, Andrew Wiggins, Markelle Fultz, etc... - and therefore he's a good candidate to continue to be a bad contract.  Atlanta has a lot of dudes about to get paid, and they have to have some value contracts.  Value contracts tend to be market distortions from superstars (max salary) and rookies that make positive contributions on rookie deals (salary scale).  The Hawks don't need to jump on any offer, but they'd be smart to gauge his value and get some current/future picks that have a chance to turn into contributors on rookie deals like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges or Halliburton or similarly lower upside guys who can help a team that has its stars.  Another team in a different position might value Reddish's potential more."
"&gt; The Warriors can trade Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th pick in 2021 draft... they can also trade a 2022 and 2028 first round pick unprotected, and a conditional unprotected pick in 2026   WTF, why are the Warriors completely dismantling their team like this?"
"The Warriors can trade Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th pick in 2021 draft. If they make the selections for the other team during the draft and execute the trade afterwards then they can also trade a 2022 and 2028 first round pick unprotected, and a conditional unprotected pick in 2026 that only conveys if their 2024 pick conveys to Memphis.   Teams shouldn‚Äôt be able to outbid the Warriors easily, and teams are smoking crack if they don‚Äôt work on taking a Warriors package pre-draft.   It shouldn‚Äôt take Dame or Beal demanding a trade for you to move them if you‚Äôre the GM when the Warriors have so much goodies to be had and you know the guys will ask out after next season at the latest anyways."
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù aren‚Äôt better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you‚Äôre obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
"Man, always a nice read. I guess most thought that the Danny Fortson-Tractor Traylor Unit Guys would lay Dray out like a Pancake, but Dray operates differently and just like eveything the warriors touch, it's perfect specifically to them.   Anyways, of the top of my head recommendations are Donoval Mitchell, Malcolm Brogdon, and Andrew Wiggins."
"I think that's a bit of revisionist history. He was definitely the greatest European prospect ever and widely regarded as an all-star caliber prospect but not LeBron, ""next MJ"" levels of hype or anywhere close. Even among international prospects Andrew Wiggins had way more hype than Luka did.   Clearly he was a great prospect but many people didn't think he'd have enough speed and explosiveness to really blow up in the NBA."
"He was our draft pick... along with Maple Jordan Andrew Wiggins, and Spanish star Ricky Rubio....  Not to mention Townes and others... none of them ever lived up to KG's talent.  Probably why the T'wolves have always sucked."
"That's true. Curry, DeRozan, Lillard will probably get there. Anthony Davis is ahead of Andrew by a decent amount, as is Kyrie Irving. Giannis is well on his way as well. Booker and Towns may pass Wiggins as he's climbing."
Marc Spears also said that Andrew Wiggins is soft because he‚Äôs from Canada on the jump one time
"Andrew Wiggins passed 10000 points scored for his career late last season. If he scores 1500 a season for another 6 seasons (he's currently 26.4 years old), and then like 700 for his last 3 seasons, which may even be too steep of a drop-off, he'd end with 21363 points, which would put him in the top 50 point scorers all time. Additionally, everyone who has more than Joe Johnson's 20405 is or will be in the Hall of Fame."
Who the hell is advising them? Deion Sanders? What are they trying to prove with that logic. All I keep thinking is Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins.
"He isn't Andrew Wiggins where there clear signs he can contribute(Take away the contract,)  funny enough wasn't he SUPPOSED to be a better Andrew Wiggins by people in the Wolves reddit when he got drafted?"
"&gt; Cunningham also has ""best player on a title team potential""  Last ten number one overall picks:  * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Deandre Ayton * Markelle Fultz * Ben Simmons * Karl-Anthony Towns * Andrew Wiggins * Anthony Bennett * Anthony Davis * Kyrie Irving  The only players on that list who have won a title are Kyrie and Davis, and that's because they played with LeBron James. Who in that group looks like they actually have ""best player on a title team"" potential? Davis, *maybe* Zion, and that's probably it. How many of those players were better than SGA in their third year? Towns, Davis, and Irving?"
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
It‚Äôs not the matter of keeping Lonzo. It‚Äôs the potential price tag (and maybe Rich Paul). Andrew Wiggins. Otto Porter Jr. Gary Harris. Sound familiar?
"Dean demakis, infamous on draft Twitter, called the wiggins bust very very early. Jabari Parker too, he explained the issues in their games and why they‚Äôd fail before they were drafted.  Here‚Äôs one of his articles on wiggins, I can link more: https://deanondraft.com/2014/02/14/andrew-wiggins-an-ordinary-player-in-an-extraordinary-body/"
&gt; a bad contract too.  [Andrew Wiggins](https://www.google.com/search?q=life+hack+meme+guy&amp;oq=life+hack+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l7j46j0.3670j1j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)
someone like Andrew Wiggins actually became much better at defence and is now a better than average defender.  it's funny when fans try to find ways to say Harden or Curry are actual good defenders now
"The Warriors actually can just make the Wizards an offer without Wiseman if they‚Äôre going to devalue him and just give them a pick buffet. If the Warriors make the draft selections for the Wizards and execute the trade after the draft their full offer can be.  * Andrew Wiggins * 7th pick * 14th pick * 2022 Unprotected Warriors pick * 2026 Warriors pick, conditioned on 2024 Warriors pick conveying to Memphis, else converts to a 2nd. * 2028 Unprotected Warriors pick  2 picks in this draft, 2 unprotected picks, and 1 conditional pick that would likely be a 3rd unprotected pick.  Pick Swaps in other years is possible as well, but probably an overpay for Beal.  This is a solid trade. You get immediate draft capital that isn‚Äôt bad, you get a late 1st next year, and then potentially 2 picks after the Warriors might fall apart in 2026 and 2028."
It‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins and LMA for us lol
"On the flip side, people were somehow convinced that Andrew Wiggins was reborn after like 10 into 2019. As if 10 games undoes the first 400 games of his career."
"The word around the league is that the Golden State Warriors are prepared to offer their 2 2021 R1 picks, Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman for this guy"
"It's important to think about defensive schemes and lineups when the playoffs come around tho. If the Warriors pick up Beal or Lillard and have to ship out Wiggins to make salaries fit, do you really want to put Klay coming off an ACL AND Achilles injury on a Kawhi/LeBron/Luka in the Western Conference? Wiggins can defend those guys and still give you 18 PPG. Also people love to ignore the fact that Wiggins DOES NOT MISS GAMES. This dude literally [delayed the birth of his child](https://nypost.com/2021/05/06/andrew-wiggins-delayed-girlfriends-labor-for-regular-season-game/) so he wouldn't have to miss a regular season game."

"Maybe 10 years ago. In today‚Äôs game there‚Äôs like 5 impactful team-leading centers. James wiseman very well could be Clint capela . The odds are more in favor of the wings.  As far as Wiggins, in a hypothetical trade to the wizards he has no value whatsoever.  He doesnt make others better, he‚Äôs 25 so he‚Äôd be too old for their new group.   It really is amazing how much he‚Äôs changed his perception based on  1 year. This sub LOVES Andrew Wiggins. It‚Äôs ridiculous"
If you don‚Äôt like Brogdons inconsistency then wait til you see Andrew Wiggins play regularly. That dude is so overrated and I‚Äôd take Brogdon over him all day. If they take Aaron off our hands and throw in Wiggins with Wiseman and that 7 pick I could live with that
Duncan Robinson is a year older than Andrew Wiggins.
"""I have to make a decision before the draft."" - Sounds like someone who talked to Draymond about the Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th, and 14th package.   Draft picks are a lot more attractive when you're the team making the call, and the Wizards probably could even send Wiseman, 7th, and 14th to another team to move into the Top 4 to get someone they really like if they're not in love with Wiseman or the options at 7.  This trade just makes too much sense not to happen. The salaries also work out in a way that allows the Warriors to take back another player in addition to Beal, removing the depth problem that Wiggins trades present.  If the trade is executed after the Warriors make their selections, with the Warriors picking for the Wizards (as most draft trades are executed) it also opens up Golden State trading another first round pick without having to redo the protections on the pick owed to Memphis.  Final trade should be   **Wizards Trade**  * Bradley Beal * Davis Bertans  **Warriors Trade**  * Andrew Wiggins * James Wiseman * 7th pick in 2021 draft * 14th pick in 2021 draft * Unprotected 2028 first round pick  That's a heck of a package, and Golden State gets to go all in on the last years of Curry's prime."
"you're all praising this guy for picking giannis - and good for him - but he  he also really picked andrew wiggins and stanley johnson, and said this:  &gt; ***Kawhi Leonard is extremely overrated, a good player, but is gaining success under Popovich and because of the players around him  it's an L overall for sure"
"I would trade 1 Andrew Wiggins. Curry, Curry, Klay, and Draymond would break the league"
Kawhi overrated lol. Andrew Wiggins. Must have been a KU fan
Andrew Wiggins lol
"Andrew Wiggins parents consist of a basketball player and a track athlete. So ya, it can translate."
You have to add Andrew Wiggins here.
"""Andrew Wiggins and MCW have proven more in one year than Giannis in two"""
Iggins wiggins of Andrew is not currently a top 5 player !
"&gt;3. Andrew Wiggins &gt;5. Stanley Johnson  Man, I forgot how much hope people had for Wiggins and Stanley."
"&gt; Zion was the most hyped prospect since LeBron.  &amp; it's not even close really. The only prospects I can think of that were hyped even 25% as much as Zion (since Lebron) are: Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, KD, Michael Beasley, and soon to be Emoni Bates (over hyped imo)"
"I don't think anybody WANTS to trade their top players away. Yet somehow they do it quite often, when the star wants out or they wanna rebuild they give them up every season.  Importantly, Warriors are probably not looking for a gigantic upgrade: Andrew Wiggins has a quite good season behind him, demonstrating he can be a piece of something, and a real defensive value. So taking his high contract is also not fully a waste for whoever gets him. And four potentially good players? In Wiseman, Smailagiƒá, two lottery picks? If you can get four, there's a good chance something comes out of it. Those are good and flexible assets for many teams."
"&gt;	Siakam is 100% more like a Bam, Dray, Giannis type of defensive player but not as good than a shut down perimeter defensive player.   Pascal is more perimeter oriented than all these players. In fact, he actually never plays as a center (OG at 5 is what they were doing with small ball 5), but all these guys do.        There are also different layers to perimeter defense. Beal and KD both initate the offense from the perimeter, but you need different type of players for guarding them.              If Pascal could guard PGs and SGs as good as he guards SFs and PFs he would have been a perennial all-defense player. He can‚Äôt so he is a little below that but that‚Äôs still much better than Andrew Wiggins."
"This is an embarrassing take. Wiggins can never be a top 3 player on a championship team. Wiggins can never lead a team to a top 3 record. It would be a miracle for Andrew to make allnba and allstar team.             Pascal has already done these.              Pascal attacking the paint off of Steph and Klay would be unstoppable offensively. Pascal also has guard skills as a 4, so I‚Äôm not surprised Kerr wants him. They can implement motion offense without deadweights like Oubre, Wiseman and Wiggins fucking up the plays."
"Cavs might have taken him a bit to literally at the end there, ""hopefully we can repeat it next year with Andrew Wiggins coming in""."
"But, they already have #1 draft pick and future superstar Andrew Wiggins!"
Maybe Andrew Wiggins
"&gt;Some on the Golden State Warriors are watching closely the next move of Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Should he become available, he‚Äôs at the top of the offseason wishlist.  &gt;The Warriors‚Äô trio of stars ‚Äî Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson ‚Äî have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.  &gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards‚Äô guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.  &gt;Of course, ‚Äúavailable‚Äù is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.  &gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men‚Äôs basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.  &gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don‚Äôt suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.  &gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.  &gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He‚Äôs a preferred target over the Raptors‚Äô Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator ‚Äî two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.  &gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn‚Äôt fit the Warriors‚Äô typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.  &gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.  &gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week‚Äôs draft. The Warriors‚Äô No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors‚Äô veterans ‚Äî Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31‚Äî is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.  &gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn‚Äôt be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors ‚Äî appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  &gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant‚Äôs ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson‚Äôs return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.  &gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.  &gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors‚Äô options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season‚Äôs end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn‚Äôt expected to return to the Warriors."

"Nationality and ethnicity are different. Im born and raised in America but I call myself Greek-American. I am Greek first before I‚Äôm American, I just live here I can literally move and change my citizenship but not my ethnicity. My ancestors didn‚Äôt live for hundreds and thousands of years in Greece for me to not be Greek cause I live in a different place. Just like Giannis‚Äô family and ancestors didnt live in Nigeria and have Nigerian culture for hundreds of years just for that to change because he grew up in Greece. He is Nigerian and should be proud of it his nickname is Greek freak because it‚Äôs fun. Just like Andrew Wiggins and Jamal Murray are maple Jordan and maple curry because they grew up in Canada"
Andrew Wiggins
"Team Success is a really horrible argument, when your team surrounds you with players like  Andrew Wiggins, and Jeff Teague as the pieces to work with most of your career.  When KAT is on the floor the Wolves are a great offensive team, when hes on the floor the Wolves are the worst in the NBA. I think that means something.  However this next season hes gonna have D'lo, a rising Edwards, Beasley, and potentially a new starting PF and I think the world will truly appreciate KAT."
Remember Andrew Wiggins vs Jabari Parker?
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Donƒçiƒá / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schr√∂der / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
I think people are worried about an Andrew Wiggins situation where they aren't a top 3 player on a championship team but get paid like one.
"Ja has 0 argument over KAT, and I think you are underselling how awful the team's KAT has been forced to be on.  Andrew Wiggins just got shipped to GS not long ago, and even with Steph Curry having what everyone thinks is ""MVP caliber"" season he still couldnt lead the Warriors to the playoffs.   So why on earth do you think KAT was ever going to have a chance?"
Scoring 20+ isn't nearly as common in college as it is in the NBA. Here are some recent Freshmen #1 picks and the number of times they scored 20+  Greg Oden: 5  Derrick Rose: 9  John Wall: 8  Kyrie Irving: 3 (only played 11 games)  Anthony Davis: 6  Anthony Bennett: 13  Andrew Wiggins: 11  KAT: 2  Ben Simmons: 18  Markelle Fultz: 18  Deandre Ayton: 17  Zion Williamson: 23  Anthony Edwards: 13
"Y'all have a nice squad going up there in Minny. Edwards does seem fun, he kind of looks like a young Andrew Wiggins, but one who actually enjoys dominating out there so lots of potential. Edwards would be a human highlight reel in Tokyo for sure...maybe he could have dunked on Yuta again lol  Knowing Pop, he prob was like oh KLove, he's as close to any Minny guy we are going to put on the team. Dude can still shoots lights out"
"Has to be the Timberwolves, they‚Äôve had at least 5 different number 1 picks on their roster the last 5 years and have consistently stayed at the bottom of their conference.   Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, KAT, DRose, Anthony Edwards‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not including their other top picks that have resulted in nothing. They definitely do not deserve Cade Cunningham."
"3 number 1 picks in 4 years when Lebron left and 2 number 4 picks.   Those players were Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters,  Anthony Bennett, Tristan Thompson and Andrew Wiggins (traded for Kevin Love)."
They already got rEvItALiZeD sUpeRsTaR dEfEnDeR andrew wiggins. They can wait a year for the pick.
This is how I thought about Andrew Wiggins
"&gt;If you have something to add, please do. No need to act like you already did though.  I did already. I said that we had too much money tied up in old players and didn't think we could build a winner around him. So we decided to get a jumpstart on our rebuild by trading him. Had nothing to do with not liking Hoiberg or some of the young players.  &gt;Would it be a smart idea to rebuild around a guy that is clearly expressing he doesn‚Äôt have patience for a rebuild?  Except he was openly expressing the exact opposite, i guess you missed when i said that too? He wanted to remain a Bull and got traded against his will.  &gt;It shows a lack or reading comprehension and understanding if you still can‚Äôt understand that this whole conversation started because i said he was GOOD for those teams until he started causing  Lol okay now you are starting to tip toe the line of personal insults, nothing wrong with my reading comprehension here at all, if anything its you that is failing to comprehend what my point was about that? You said every team traded him cause he wasn't worth the issues, i explained that only one team did that and was hilariously wrong.  &gt;So, is it your opinion that all those OTHER people were the unprofessional ones  You mean Hoiberg, Brett Brown, Ben Simmons and Andrew Wiggins? Yes, I think they were the problem more so than him. Do you *really* disagree with that?  &gt;Maybe, just maybe, Jimmy himself is the unprofessional one causing trouble everywhere he goes  He causes immidiet success everywhere he goes, with the cost of calling out people that he doesn't think plays hard enough. Again, every team that has got rid of him regrets it except Wolves. Does that *really* tell you that he causes too much issues everywhere?  &gt;He‚Äôs just a diva who calls people out that he doesn‚Äôt like - whether it be their personality, attitude, whatever.  What evidence do you have of this? It has always been work related as far as I know. Wether its passion, work ethic or unproductive film sessions."
"Instead of KD leaving in free agency for absolutely nothing, the front office was able to turn that situation into Andrew Wiggins and two Timberwolves' picks. How those picks play out is still to be determined though."
Dudes a bum.  Andrew Wiggins has a more team friendly contract at this point.
&gt;Watching 5 whole basketball games? Instead of you simply explaining your opinion?  You literally told me there is no way Andrew Wiggins would outperform Jimmy Butler and somehow anything I write is supposed to inform you or change your opnion.  Go and watch the games if you don't believe me.
Andrew Wiggins was all potential too.   At some point they just are who they are and you gotta stop expecting dramatic changes or improvements
"Contracts like Ben Simmons, Kemba Walkers, Tobias Harris, Siakam and Andrew Wiggins will be the reason why the amnesty clause returns."
This is that Andrew Wiggins energy!
Timelord with Curry‚Äôs shooting and Andrew Wiggins durability. Not the best but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like.
"This Warriors ownership and front office *really* want to be the next Spurs.   That means developing the next batch of talent while you still got your current but aging core.   I know Wiseman wasn't great his rookie year but he showed lots of potential, Poole is looking like he's a year away from winning a 6MOY award, and the Warriors have two cracks at lotto picks in this draft.   They've developed some bench talent, guys like Poole of course, but Damion Lee gave good bench minutes, Bazemore (who will almost certainly be back) gave good minutes off the bench despite some of his frustrating fouling/turn over tendencies, Mulder's not great but he's another shooter, can defend a little better than first thought, and has continuity with the team.   Juan Tuscano Anderson has been a great find, very hard nosed, tough, plays good defense and has out of nowhere this season decided he can hit open 3's.   I hope they can bring back Oubre, Jessup will get a chance to prove he deserves a roster spot during summer league, but a couple other guys should be off the roster.   When I look at the roster the Warriors might be fielding next season:  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Andrew Wiggins  Draymond Green  Kevon Looney  Jordan Poole  Kelly Oubre (maybe)  Juan Toscano-Anderson  Damion Lee  Michael Mulder   a couple lottery picks  1 or 2 ring chasing veterans  I feel like that's a roster that can compete for a title with any team I've watched play in this year's playoffs."
"&gt;You mean the series where Butler was the best player on your team? Leading the team in scoring (tied with KAT) but doing so much more efficiently while being their 2nd best playmaker?  Actually wrong. As absurd as it is Andrew Wiggins was the best Timberwolf player against the Rockets but again you just went on bbref and looked at the stats....  &gt;The Timberwolves were 37-22 with Butler that season and 10-13 without him, so, uhh nobody kept the team afloat when Butler went down. You were horrible.  Team missing its all star goes 0.500 but yeah that's horrible."
"The fact is that they were only not able to offer Butler a full max until the summer because they gave Wiggins his own 5 year max early. They acquired Butler in June of 2017 and didn't max Wiggins until October 2017. Why tf would you even trade so much for Butler if you planned to make him wait until the summer for a max extension, instead prioritizing Andrew Wiggins."
&gt;Because it was the maximum amount of money he could have been offered at the time.  Because your GM gave Andrew Wiggins a 5 year max early.  Feel free to change the facts though lol.
"If John Wall and Andrew Wiggins could get traded, so can Ben"
Yeah injuries to KAT and his best teammates being Jeff Teague and Andrew Wiggins weren't a factor at all LOL
"Knowing team construction isn't all one need to know. We do need somebody who can handle the ball, but the PG we need right now needs to be able to shoot. Wiggins is also our main wing right now, and he's our 2nd option (solid as a third option next season), while Ben cannot score to save his life. Wings like Andrew are becoming a rarity, and he's finally overcome his passiveness, which is the problem right now for Ben. Steph is going to lose his mind if Ben plays as passive as he did tonight.   &gt; the floor general for a large collection of shooters  Stop acting as if you've watched the warriors please. We need spacing and the few shooters that we have are infuriously bricking wide open threes, what does Ben contribute in that area ? He can't coordinate a defense from the frontcourt as Dray does.  Terrible fit.  &gt;I‚Äôm also aware this sub isn‚Äôt r/nbadiscussion, and I fully expected the backlash I‚Äôm receiving.  Lol, go ahead and post it there, we'll see what your expectations are.  I am not trying to be rude, but dear friend, the trade isn't going to happen. Wiggins is on a friendlier contract as well, and our FO isn't bad enough not to consider that.  P.S: Lol, now you've removed the post ? Ok, have a nice day."
"Here‚Äôs one for you:  76ers receive - Andrew Wiggins, 2nd round pick  Warriors receive - Ben Simmons"
Dragan Bender - lol  Jahlil Okafor - lol  DeAndre Jordan - maybe a bit of a lol  Andre Drummond - oh god  DeMarcus Cousins - wasn't his fault he got fucked by his body  Andrew Wiggins - meh
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn‚Äôt the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"

Looking at you GS and Andrew wiggins
I'm happy with DLo too and I'm happy for Wiggins. A solid 3 and D guy is a long ways away from a franchise player which we were really banking on with him and that contract. Andrew Wiggins has never ever been bad imo he's just not the guy and watching a role player take 20 shots a game for 4 odd years is fucking rough on the soul
"First Andrew Wiggins, now Ben Simmons? Hey, countries not known for basketball, stop robbing our American money and getting away with it!"
Andrew Wiggins is way better than Jonathan Simmons stop it
"What's funny is that the process isn't even the reason the sixers were good.   The Sixers lucked into Embiid.   I don't know if y'all remember this, but coming into the draft Embiid was broken goods.   Prior to that College year, all the rave was with Jabari Parker and Andrew Wiggins and Andrew Wiggins even came in late cause he reclassified his high school graduation year.   But prior to that college year Wiggins and parker were the talk of the town but then Embiid came up big during the college year and was hyped as the \#1 Pick. Then a health report came out that Embiid had some knee issue that would be a problem going forward I think it got compared to what Yao Ming had. So his draft stock fell and Sixers went after the opportunity and drafted Embiid \#3.  I don't think Sixers fans were happy at the time due to said Health issue but Embiid was turned out to be the best Player from that draft. So Sixers got lucky with Embiid.   Then they got Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz and we know how that turned out."
"Somewhere, Andrew Wiggins flashes that trademark smile and he doesn‚Äôt know why."
Simmons on the Andrew Wiggins story arc except Wiggins can shoot sometimes.
I wanted to say Andrew Wiggins and Eric Paschall but....nahhhh
Is Ben Simmons on an Andrew Wiggins story arc.
Lmao Andrew Wiggins is a top 7 player for Canada have fun with that
Andrew Wiggins/Derozan/Westbrook are very good answers too. Think a lot of these guys are kinda based in the last game you saw them play in as they‚Äôre so volatile as to how their games can go. So recency bias can overtake a lot
"He's development is kinda like Andrew Wiggins in reverse. Wiggins takes too many shots, ben doesn't like taking them."
Who would have been more useful this series? Rudy Gobert or ‚Äúconfirmed bust‚Äù Andrew Wiggins?
Ben Simmons / Andrew Wiggins? (assuming Klay comes back healthy)
Damn is Ben going to end up a bigger bust than Andrew Wiggins?
Andrew Maple Jordan Wiggins.
"Even if you pick outside of the top 5 it is not a bad thing just take shots.  Kawhi (15), PG (9), Mitchell (13), Gobert (27), Booker (13), Paul (3), Giannis (15), Middleton (39), Young (5), Simmons (1), Embiid (3), Durrant (2), Irving (1), Harden (3).   Even if you fail on your picks, you can still be in a good position.   The Jazz do not have a lottery pick that they drafted on the roster and they had the best record in the NBA. I believe the Clippers and the Bucks are also in the same boat as well as far as not having a lottery pick they drafted on the roster.   The League MVP this year was drafted in the second round. What matters more is development and scouting of the picks.   Andrew Wiggins was supposed to be the next Lebron and ended up as a good player, but not on that level.   Even at the top of the draft it can be difficult even if you take the better player with the Media.   The Reggie Miller pick for the Pacers was hated at the time by the Pacers media and fans, because they wanted Steve Alford from Indiana.   Just take as many shots as you can at it."

Idk people call Andrew Wiggins a bust because he didn‚Äôt live up to the massive hype. Simmons is starting to do the same.
"&gt; Anthony Edwards will become the most efficient high-volume scorer out of any player of his 2020 Draft class.   This isn't controversial at all. I mean, who else would it be?  &gt;The contract Kristaps Porzingis is on right now is a lot better than what people make it out to be.  How so? Because it legitimately seems pretty shit  &gt;Andrew Wiggins will be a 20,000 point scorer at the end of his career.  Again, not controversial. He's only 26 has already cracked 10,000"
Trae Young is better than Andrew Wiggins offensively.
Ok we get it Jokic isn‚Äôt playing in the olympics and your not happy about it. It‚Äôs not like my team Canada is missing their two best players in Shai and Jamal Murray. Or all those times Andrew Wiggins and 2 time mvp Steve Nash failed to show up. These circumstances has not only diminished our chances of winning the qualifier but also our chances of obtaining a medal.  In fact I‚Äôm kind of happy that Jokic isn‚Äôt participating because it gives Canada just that much higher of a chance to still obtain a medal.

"Andrew Wiggins actually never asked to move on. He just said, ""If I can get a $400 fake vaccine card, that'd be something I would love to have. If not, ivermectin is fine."" I said, ""What about a free vaccine?"" He said, ""Hell no."""
Andrew Wiggins furiously dropping KAJ below Wilt in his all time rankings.
"i have mixed emotions about this specific instance though.  on one hand, anti-vaxxers need to be pressed on their stupidity. on the other hand we know he's vaccinated and he already said he wants to keep his opinions private. i feel like at that point you should just respect his wishes... unless he's the one bringing it up like andrew wiggins... then keep pressing him and call him out on his bullshit..."
"Sad thing is, he does have the raw talent to okay like Giannis. But his fear of failure and lack of responsibility will hold him back.  He's going to be a better Andrew Wiggins."
Looking at you Andrew Wiggins
Who has Andrew Wiggins killed? He might have taken years off Jimmy Butler‚Äôs life but J is still kicking as far as I know
Andrew Wiggins hates his family confirmed.
Will you trade for one Andrew Wiggins?
"Imagine if Wiggins was on the Spurs - 'Yo Pop, that shit ain't for me, done 15min research on Facebook and turns out...can't trust it...'  Pop- 'Unfortunately Andrew didjt align with this season's strategy, I would like to wish him well in his future career running an incense retreat with Kyrie on the flat side of the earth'.  Would absolutely be Cam Newton 2.0"
Bro maybe u didn't thank about it but the reason that most players mentioned family as the reason for getting the vaccine is to convince others skeptical about to take the vaccines not for themselves but for their families Eg: Andrew Wiggins should probably think about his family maybe take the vaccine to avoid being a covid hazard for his family
Fuck it take Andrew Wiggins we will figure it out later.
It's a very relevant topic right now when it might stop Andrew Wiggins or Kyrie Irving from playing in a lot of games?  You seem very triggered.
"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my family‚Äôs problem, not mine‚Äù - Andrew Wiggins"
He‚Äôs an Andrew Wiggins fan lmao

You know who would go great with Embiid? Andrew Wiggins. Make it happen please.
"Also, Andrew Wiggins.   You‚Äôre a Toronto boy you were raised better than to be a wasteman"
Imagine the tension if Wiggins was still in Minnesota. You think Andrew would have a different stance on the vaccination if he saw it first hand affect his teammate the way it has KAT?
Probably distrust in the media. Kyrie is one of the best NBA players on the planet and the idiots at  white-controlled-ESPN actually tried to build a narrative that teams would pass on him because of his antics in Boston during his contract year LMAO. The same can probably be said for Andrew Wiggins who is a decent player and it's not his fault the Wolves offered him that insane money.  It's honestly not a big deal what their vax status is considering that most of the league is vaccinated but the white controlled sports media will never hesitate to tear down another black man whos out there to get his bag.  The whole thing has been blown out of proportion and y'all are eating it all up.

Psssst it absolutely is. 120 million people under the age on 31 in America according to the CDC own website there‚Äôs under 400 deaths in that whole age group‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure a healthy Andrew Wiggins is gonna do just fine with dealing with the virus

‚Äò‚ÄôAndrew Wiggins is an amazing human being‚Äù - Steve Kerr
"Sorry, but the idea that it's somehow uncouth to expect strangers get vaccinated doesn't make sense. The people who are most vulnerable are threatened by the people who are unvaccinated. To say it's a ""family decision"" or some bullshit like that is silly because you interact with more people than your immediate social circle. We LITERALLY live in a society. That means there's a social contract and in my opinion, taking reasonable steps to help protect the most vulnerable out there is a its foundation. If you insist on posing a health risk to others, you have broken the contract by willfully putting others in danger. Usually, that means someone goes to jail. If you drink and drive, you go to jail. If you yell fire in a crowded theater, you go to jail. If you don't pay your taxes, you (should) go to jail. If you dump your trash in the middle of the street, you pay a fine if you're caught. Why is willfully remaining unvaccinated any different?   I'm not saying unvaccinated people should be rounded up. But they shouldn't expect to take part in public life because they're willfully endangering people for basically no legitimate reason. It's ridiculously irresponsible and selfish. I have no problem with Andrew Wiggins being ostracized because he's literally putting other people's lives at risk.  What's more, the idea that you have to be personally threatened in order to be properly motivated to get the vaccine is ludicrous. If one doesn't view the suffering as others as a legitimate reason to act as long as one is personally safe, then that person is selfish and not welcome in my community, and the majority of Americans agree. I don't know how to explain to you that you should care about other people EVEN IF you've never met them. Otherwise, I really don't care what happens to you, because you don't care what happens to me. Andrew Wiggins is making 30 million dollars a year to sit around on his ass most of the time. He can deal with a little criticism. If you disagree, then I'd ask you why the hell is Wiggins' right to act with impunity without criticism more important to you than my right to stay alive and not have to live in fear?  And this is besides the point, but all your figures are exaggerated. No, it's not a ""very very very small minority,"" it's LITERALLY MILLIONS of people. And we count too. I was lucky enough to not be immunocompromised enough to get the vaccine but there are plenty who just can't. Don't dismiss us."
If we can get a Ben Simmons/Andrew Wiggins/Kyrie Irving 3 way trade then I will admit that GODGEVLAMSTE on YouTube is indeed RIGHT and we do in fact live in a crater!
"Are you seriously commenting this on every single vaccine related post you can find on the subreddit?  Vaccination status is important and good info to post on r/nba because it does have effects on the game. Kyrie Irving could miss games for this, same for Andrew Wiggins. In this case with this post there‚Äôs drama going on in the Warriors organization over Wiggins so naturally that‚Äôs going to be reported and posted.   The more players are vaccinated, the less time is missed for health and safety protocols. It‚Äôs that simple."
"You're talking about Top 10 all-time, not just some perennial all-star. Those players are expected to be able to drag their team to the playoffs.  Hakeem was making the playoffs in the late 90s when his best teammates were Purvis Short and Rodney McCray.  Kareem was taking the pre-Magic Lakers to the playoffs with Cazzie Russell as his #2.  Is it easy to drag Purvis Short, Cazzie Russell or Andrew Wiggins to the playoffs? Of course not - but it's not easy to become a top 10 all-timer, either. There's a high bar.  We saw KD pretty much single-handedly take the champs to 7 games and miss beating them by a few inches. That's more like a top 10 all-time type effort."
I don't even know this Andrew Wiggins.
"This information is easily available via Google. [here you go buddy](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-andrew-wiggins-clings-personal-beliefs-over-covid-vaccine).   &gt; For every game he misses, he‚Äôll forfeit more than $350,000 in pre-tax salary."
"Then he can be Andrew Wiggins former basketball player. The NBA is a private company that abides by rules set in place by the state government. California requires vaccination for big indoor gatherings. So Andre Wiggins basketball player either gets vaccinated or doesn‚Äôt play. Andrew Wiggins the person can lose his job, if it‚Äôs that important that he doesn‚Äôt get the jab."
‚ÄúIs Andrew Wiggins relevant enough to force the nba to make an exception‚Äù
if wiggins makes an all nba team i will buy an andrew wiggins jersey
My grandma died because there were so many COVID patients that there weren‚Äôt any beds available for her to get surgery. People like Andrew Wiggins can eat a bag of dicks.
Guys hear me out: maybe Andrew Wiggins is deathly afraid of needles?
"That‚Äôs cool but we don‚Äôt know Andrew Wiggins. We know the guy on the Warriors that won‚Äôt be able to play in his home state, which is a bummer for Warriors fans, so we talk about it on the basketball subreddit"
You guys are weird for even worrying about it. I'm not anti vax but what the next dude does with his body is literally no one's business. He's Andrew Wiggins before he is a basketball player for the Warriors.
"just found this pic of Wiggins checking his phone on media day, feels like it has good potential:  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/andrew-wiggins-of-the-golden-state-warriors-checks-his-phone-during-picture-id1343388029?s=2048x2048"
Where was Andrew Wiggins on Jan 6th?
"[\[Marks\] Just ask the Minnesota Timberwolves about the $147.7 million max contract of Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins has failed to live up to expectations, and the extension was at the root of Jimmy Butler's unhappiness in Minnesota, league sources confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dd9y2p/marks_just_ask_the_minnesota_timberwolves_about/)"
Andrew Wiggins has 29.5 million reasons to take the vaccine.
"What do you want? A tweet from Bjelica saying ""Andrew Wiggins is a close friend of mine?"" I think if you publicly call your coworker one of the best people you've ever met and say that you're supporting him with whatever he needs, that's a pretty strong implication that you're good friends with him."
"Wiggins being inefficient again, they say you miss every shot you don't take, that makes Wiggins 0 for 2.  Whereas I am 2 for 2.   Ergo I am more efficient shot taker than Andrew Wiggins."
imagine your entire season being at risk because of Andrew Wiggins lmao
Yep and I just said it about Andrew Wiggins
Andrew Wiggins bum ass
"So because they‚Äôre performing instead of attending that somehow changes the safety protocols the entire city has ? Why would the city make exceptions to public safety based on that..?  If you wanna argue semantics, the specific wording of that link isn‚Äôt attending but ‚Äúto go indoors‚Äù, which would apply to the players as well...  And Andrew Wiggins would be performing as well. So if for whatever reason they did treat athletes as different then the average person, there‚Äôs 0 reason they‚Äôd differentiate between home players and away players."
Andrew wiggins bad upvote left
"oh you'd take the all NBA player over Andrew Wiggins, fascinating lmao I get that we're down on Ben and high on Wiggs after last year but this shouldn't be the reason you make that decision."
"I was in a Burgers Priest in Scarborough when Andrew Wiggins walked in. Dude saw everyone was whispering and offered to take photos with everyone, ""as long as you join me in prayer"". most people agreed and even some staff thought it was cool so Andrew got one of his guys to go back to the escalade and brought out a basket with little garter snakes. Wiggins lifted one up and did a quick prayer, then took photos with people. when i asked him to redo mine (it was blurry) he instead offered to buy me a burger ""as long as I joined him in prayer"". I'm afraid of snakes (long story short my nephew was swallowed by a reticulated python) and told him that and he appreciated that info and respected my opinion, then went and ordered a chili cheese dog (i went with a vatican city)"
"&gt; Andrew Wiggins: ""My back is definitely against the wall, but I'm just going to keep fighting for what I believe.""  bruh"
"""Beliefs"" doesn't have to mean he is religious.  He just ""believes"" how knows better than everybody else...like his teammates, coaches, doctors, scientists, etc.  Because, you know...Andrew Wiggins has proven to everybody he is just so damn smart, why should anybody question him?"
Andrew Wiggins showing up to the Chase Center in sunglasses with the fake nose and mustache.
"&gt;The city of San Francisco's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for large indoor events ‚Äî which will force Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins to miss home games at Chase Center unless he gets vaccinated ‚Äî does not apply to unvaccinated players on visiting teams.  &gt;Some have found it strange that the city's mandate applies only to Warriors players and not opposing players who are reportedly unvaccinated, such as the Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving or the Washington Wizards' Bradley Beal. Attempts to explain the discrepancy have largely painted the question as a legal and jurisdictional issue and not a policy choice on behalf of the city. (""Because [visiting players] are not employees of a company that is under the city‚Äôs limits, the rules don‚Äôt currently apply"" reads a paragraph from a recent piece in The Athletic.)  &gt;However, the city's health department currently requires bars, gyms and restaurants to screen customers for proof of vaccination, regardless of whether that customer lives in the city or not. The health department is also using its authority to mandate masks, physical distancing and testing for out-of-town unvaccinated players, which strongly suggests it has the ability to bar unvaccinated opposing players from Chase Center if it so desires."
I‚Äôm fine if he doesn‚Äôt.  I don‚Äôt consider Andrew Wiggins a bust cause he‚Äôs still out here in the league starting. I‚Äôd still call him a good player though.
Andrew Wiggins: ‚Äúfuck my kid.‚Äù
Andrew Wiggins is you favorite player?  This is satire?
What about Andrew Wiggins
"Well, of late, the idea that Ben Simmons is worth a king‚Äôs ransom in draft picks and players.  He‚Äôs good. He‚Äôs a lot better than a lot of people saw in the Hawks series. But expecting four firsts and Andrew Wiggins is silly.  Also, that we should fire Doc Rivers because he‚Äôs not a championship coach. That one got me."
As of this week - Andrew Wiggins
Off the court : Andrew Wiggins  On the court : Mychal Mulder
"And yet we still have dumbass like like Andrew ""religious exemption"" Wiggins and Johnathan ""Misrepresentation only allows for others to attack straw men, and not reason with the true ideas and heart of their fellow man."" Isaac.  It's great that the NBA is &gt;85% vaccinated. But the few that arent are spouting dumbass ""I didnt finish college and this is deep"" shit that can be refuted by any sane person."
Yeah I think Andrew Wiggins and Kyrie shouldn‚Äôt have to disclose whether or not they are vaccinated
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
"Yeah, what will the league do without Andrew Wiggins.  If you think any max player is actually going to miss a years worth of pay cheques because of some medical advice they got from an Instagram MD, you're dreaming."
"Stern was also the ultimate Capitalist. If he were in charge, we might see Andrew Wiggins or Kyrie get those Religious Exemptions just to keep league revenue growing."
"&gt; RJ Barrett: Khris Middleton &gt;  &gt;   The Ringer had RJ's pro comp as ""Alpha Andrew Wiggins"""
"Actual Starting 5 - Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson , Andrew Wiggins , Draymond Green , James Wiseman   Their Draft comparisions - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf , Marco Belinelli , Vince Carter/Rudy Gay , Jared Dudley/Luke Harangody , Hassan Whiteside/DeAndre Jordan"
"All these superstars? What star other than Kyrie is unvaccinated, and please don't say Andrew Wiggins"
Andrew Wiggins at least didn't get worse every year.
2b fair they traded for Andrew Wiggins on a max what did they think would happen. Good stuff?
Do you have a source for this being Andrew Wiggins' objection?
Is Andrew Wiggins a black israelite like the commenter said? Just curious if not then I'm sorry to bring this up
How does this relate to Andrew Wiggins?
&gt;Going through the rising stars games‚Ä¶   &gt;Tyreke Evans   &gt;Brandon Jennings   &gt;Bregman Roe     &gt;Andre Drummond   &gt;Andrew Wiggins   &gt;Jabari Parker  I mean it tough to say Drummond and not think of Greg Monroe too. Pistons thought they had some twin towers for a stretch.  Edit: just now realizing Bregman Roe is Greg Monroe.. did you use text-to-speech? Lol
Would be interesting if they all stand up one by one saying ‚ÄúI am Andrew Wiggins ‚Äú like at the end of Spartacus
Going through the rising stars games‚Ä¶   Tyreke Evans   Brandon Jennings   Bregman Roe     Andre Drummond   Andrew Wiggins   Jabari Parker
Fuck Andrew Wiggins
Ben Simmons for an unvaxxed Andrew Wiggins? Do you have to be vaxxed to play in philly?
Fuck andrew wiggins
He's like Andrew Wiggins
