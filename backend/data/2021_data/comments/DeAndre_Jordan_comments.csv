"He wears a size 18, which is really big but it's the same size as KD, Dwight, DeAndre Jordan. Smaller than brook and Robin lopez's feet"
Harden has become Deandre Jordan's best friend. If he can make Jordan effective with those lobs it really changes the energy of that second unit. Jordan on Zubac was also a pretty good matchup.
Are you familiar with DeAndre Jordan?
With three hall of fame caliber scorers to draw defensive attention the stage is set for 25 DeAndre Jordan post ups per game.
There was one play where he spent 10 seconds of the shot clock yelling at DeAndre Jordan and then they ran side PnR and DJ immediately had a wide open dunk on a lob
Then DeAndre Jordan is open.   THE LOB! THE J...  Just kidding we’re in 2021 not 2011
Well it sure as hell wasn’t gonna be called for DeAndre Jordan
"Deandre Jordan had an interesting ritual for a while (not sure if he still does it). He would ask someone who their man was and he NEEDED to touch the basketball while the ref had it before the throw. Not sure how much of this he still does but it was very interesting. It even seemed to help since he was historically a low % free throw shooter. Dwight is a weird one, he steps a foot or two behind the line then shoots"
DeAndre Jordan got to play with Chris Paul for the entirety of his prime.
"I mean DeAndre Jordan doesn't factor into intentional foul situations really anyway too much but yeah Harden, KD, Kyrie is a deadly trio of intentional foul targets."
How dare you insult Deandre Jordan.
"Yeah those years were wack, Jordan, Marc Gasol and Joakim. All good players in their prime (Deandre the worst of the 3) but comparing it with the guys today like AD, Jokic, Embiid is rough"
**DeAndre Jordan** was **All-NBA** **FIRST TEAM** in 2016
If I were DeAndre Jordan I would simply grab that rebound
Lue must be be into some BDSM shit to not sub out Zubac when he's getting cooked by friggin Deandre Jordan.
DeAndre Jordan is so washed it's not even funny
watching deandre jordan attempt to jump is actual comedy
Deandre Jordan is literally only on the team for cool dunks
Pretty sure Deandre Jordan just fouled James Harden right there.
#SHOULDVE STARTED DEANDRE JORDAN THIS SMALL BALL SHIT IS NOT GONNA WORK
I thought the Lakers exposed this small ball shit last season? Where the hell is DeAndre Jordan lol?
"Reggie, Ray, Steph, Klay, Nash. Vs Shaq, D12, chuck hayes, Deandre Jordan, Ben Wallace,"
Getting DeAndre Jordan to 1st team All-NBA is Chris Paul's greatest achievement of his career
"also brought Deandre Jordan with him, and he’s been a huge liability on defense."
"Ehh yes and no. Weve definitely won games this year just because no one else could bang with drummond (pistons game, Knicks game and 2nd nets game) I think at his best there is very few centers who can rebound with him or handle him down low. Hes in a weird spot right now because the cavs have such a young team that we are trying to develop so it's an odd mix of trying to put Drummond and love into this young teams offense because theres only so many touches to go around . Where Andre gets in trouble is when we let him handle the ball for long stretches. I think that's a bickerstaff issue though and not a drummond issue. Make no mistake, coming from someone who has watched every cavs game, he is a definite upgrade over DeAndre Jordan and I think if he played with durant harden and Irving he would accept his role and be the inside presence you guys are missing. Hes also a way better defender than people  realize (top ten in steals). I dont see how he wouldnt make the nets better. They have such a glaring hole that he can help mend"
we drafted him so he'd be coming home. you can keep deandre jordan though
Did you not see oladipo and Allen I’m pretty sure that right there could easily make them a average or good defensive team like have you seen Deandre Jordan in the paint on defense   Like one thing people don’t say about the nets is that they are a good perimeter defense team but the paint is completely open and when they go against lebron and ad two players who will dominate Deandre I wouldn’t be surprised is that Allen is a deal breaker   But of course I would trade Allen for harden any day but advice for you read everything before a comment
No worries. He’ll get it next week after he barbecues the corpse of Deandre Jordan on national TV.
"Bruce Brown is by far their best defender, but he's really too small to be THAT impactful, especially against teams that don't really run their offense trought their guards, and no matter how good he can be, he can be screened of and then it's over when the screener's man is Deandre Jordan  Overall the ""anchor"" should be KD if he wanted to, he's the guy that has proved (the 2016 Playoffs, his first year in GS) that he can be an elite help defender but he also just came back from 18 months without playing and he's (understandably) more eager to reestablish himself as an elite scorer/mvp level player offensively"
"I love the Nets matchup for us. They have absolutely nothing to stop Giannis one on one in half court or transition, nor are they remotely capable of building a wall and zoning him out as currently constructed. Middleton they might be ok with but I don’t see their guards having a very good time with Jrue driving to the rim either.  KD and Harden can pull up for days but if I’m picking between literally anybody taking pull up jumpers over Lopez drops and Giannis taking on Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan at the rim that’s not a contest."
Positions dont matter anymore especially for a 6'11 player that can move like a guard. He will still be a good center on defense for the nets. Simmons can pretty much do everything Old Ass deandre Jordan can plus elite passing and defense. Positionless basketball nets would be a nightmare.
DJ = Deandre Jordan  NC = Nick Collison?  TP = Tony Parker?  JE = ?  GA = Georgia.  JN = Jameer Nelson?  GO = Greg Oden!
"Deandre Jordan plays \~20 mins a night. The backup center is a rookie so they just play KD or Jeff Green at center half the game.   Kyrie is small so he can't affect shots as well even if he's putting in the effort on D.   Broadly speaking they have a very small and light team, even on the bench a lot of their players strong enough to be great rebounders for their position or box out every play as well. Harden was actually an upgrade in rebounding from Lavert, but he didn't play tn,"
" They overpaid the corpse of DeAndre Jordan because thin-skinned stars wanted to play with their buddy.  Then they fired a good coach because thin-skinned stars were pissy that the better player was starting over their buddy.  At some point, you've got to tell these guys ""no"" and not let big-names dictate front office moves, coaching decisions, rotations, etc."
"Harden’s defensive strength (the post &amp; ability to switch onto bigger players) is so useless on this team. More than anything they need to stop dribble penetration because they have absolutely no backline defense, and Harden gets blown by regularly. Kyrie gets lost offball and also gets blown by pretty regularly. This leaves Deandre Jordan guarding the rim lol or KD helping off his man (who can then take advantage and score)."
Don't forget the washed corpse of Deandre Jordan
It's based off a tweet about Cuban when he was about to sign DeAndre Jordan before CP3 and Blake locked him in his house and made him sign with the clips.
I feel like a lot of people were predicting it. They have like 1 positive defender on their roster and their only rim protection is Deandre Jordan who is trash at this point
 DeAndre Jordan LMAO!
"DeAndre Jordan is gonna shove Wagner at some point, no doubt about it"
"reggie Perry for 3...    next thing you know, DeAndre Jordan gonna be launching 3s"
Is it fair that deandre jordan was 1st team all nba before?
Kyrie/Bruce Brown/Joe Harris/Jeff Green/DeAndre Jordan is honestly kinda good in this scenario
"We had the second kind of player in DeAndre Jordan, especially towards the end of his Clippers tenure.  No desire to contest a player making an aggressive drive to the rim.  He'd just hope the guy would blow a wide open dunk so he could grab the defensive board."
My team-  QB Jokic  RB Russ  WR LeBron  WR Giannis  Slot KD  TE Zion  RT Anthony Davis  RG DeMarcus Cousins  C Steven Adams  LG DeAndre Jordan  LT Gobert  DE Kawhi  DE Nurkic  DT Embiid  DT Dwight   LB Draymond  LB Butler  LB Jaylen Brown  CB Wall  CB Jrue  FS Lowry  SS Smart
Deandre Jordan who shoots 43% from three but yes totally agree
"Wiseman is great but right now he is basically asked to be Deandre Jordan. Not that its a bad thing and that he wont be more in the future, but if you watch his best games there are a lot of rim running dunks"
DeAndre Jordan is guarding him.
I only remember Brandon Knight’s existence when I see that clip of Deandre Jordan ending his life
"I was thinking the one where he got absolutely demolished by DeAndre Jordan, but I guess there’s a few now that I think about it. Poor guy could never catch a break"
&gt;Why is the NBA HoF easy to get into?   The NBA HoF doesn't exist. It's the basketball HoF.  And it's easier to get into because they count international achievements and even your college career. A player like DeAndre Jordan might even have a chance because he has a gold medal.
"Well, I wouldn't say the Nets are anchored by our Center. (Though maybe you could say DeAndre Jordan is going to ultimately hold the Nets down in a bad way.) And the Nets are likely the best team in the East.   Anyway, a good Center can really make a team's defense. So no, the position isn't dead by any means. But interesting to point out the specific situation we find our selves in between Embiid, Gobert, and Jokic. I'd throw AD in there as a Center who is dominant as well even if he also plays PF. He plays Center when the game is important and the score is tight. Plenty of room in this game for the big man!"
"It really depends who gets fouled.  you wouldn't want DeAndre Jordan ( 56% this season taking them). Although in general, I'd say most teams would take the chance with the 70% shooter instead of rebounding."
"There are a lot of things I don't want to see in this world. Add ""DeAndre Jordan is the Nets best and starting center"" to that list."
Gotta gather the nephews around for story time and tell them about when Deandre Jordan was actually good
"&gt;By asserting Bogut as some sort of counter-argument to the discussion, when he is actually a prime archetype of why people said the position was dying.  I've repeatedly expressed disagreement on what people ""thought"" about the position at the time. Many of those same people look at Rudy Gobert and are not impressed because he has no creation ability. The common fans evaluation of centers is limited to offense, NOT overall impact as many don't know how to assess overall impact to begin with in basketball let alone the position.    &gt;What they mean is DeAndre Jordan being a 1st team All-NBA Center, no center making a deep playoff run as the clear best player on their team, no superstar centers for years in the league, etc.  DeMarcus Cousins was better than Deandre Jordan, for one. You should know that media decided awards are not some end all test for player rankings. There's also a comparison to be made between Cousins and Towns regarding the lack of success for their respective teams, in contrast to their production and on/off metrics that support them being influential. If Cousins were someone else, would he have suddenly killed the ""death of the center"" narrative? Quite possibly. Certainly had the potential to be first team over Deandre Jordan!  Second, the very year after that Rudy Gobert emerged and Marc Gasol was clearly better than Jordan (an often forgotten part of this discussion). I'm not seeing role players in those two players. I'm not seeing a period where the best center in the league was a role player. That's kinda ridiculous.   &gt;He didn't revive anything, but subsequent players like Jokic and Embiid did, because the position did need reviving. They dispelled the notion of a center not being a position that could harbor a superstar, a clear best player on the team that hopes to contend.  That notion was stupid. Dwight Howard, despite all his offensive limitations, led the right supporting cast to the Finals. Of course another talented big could do the same. It just took the right player and the right environment.  ANYONE who denied that, was being an in the moment idiot, as are the people who thought the position was dying.  &gt;The notion of ""the death of a center"" was not one of people not posting up, it was a notion of centers being relegated to roleplayers in order to have team success. And this notion would persist still if DeAndre Jordan kept being the best center in the league and guys like Bogut at center were hallmarks of a competitive roster.  Deandre was never the best center in the league. We need to stop saying that. People who say that are the reason the ""death of the center"" was ever a thing."
"&gt;When did I ever frame it as ""there will be no good impactful centers anymore""? I'm saying that the ""death of the center"" discussion is misphrased.  By asserting Bogut as some sort of counter-argument to the discussion, when he is actually a prime archetype of why people said the position was dying. He was not s star, he was not a player with elite impact, he was a role-player on championship team.  He was a solid, impactful center, but not more than that. And that's what a lot of people thought the position would remain to be.  &gt;What they mean is offensive, post up scoring centers. Not the position lacking in value or being in any danger of being made obsolete.  No, what they mean is the position lacking in value precisely because offensive post up centers are not as valuable anymore.  What they mean is DeAndre Jordan being a 1st team All-NBA Center, no center making a deep playoff run as the clear best player on their team, no superstar centers for years in the league, etc.   The center position was the weakest it had probably ever been for a few years there.  No one is saying the center is dying now just because Jokic, KAT, Embiid are shooting jumpers. Because it was never about post play, it was about impact.    &gt;No one said Bogut revived anything. He didn't need to revive anything, because nothing actually needed reviving. He was a good player for a great team that valued his contributes to their team. The Warriors are the poster boy for this topic and they still valued centers on their team. That would be my point.  He didn't revive anything, but subsequent players like Jokic and Embiid did, because the position did need reviving. They dispelled the notion of a center not being a position that could harbor a superstar, a clear best player on the team that hopes to contend.   The notion of ""the death of a center"" was not one of people not posting up, it was a notion of centers being relegated to roleplayers in order to have team success. And this notion would persist still if DeAndre Jordan kept being the best center in the league and guys like Bogut at center were hallmarks of a competitive roster."
"Lol there was a stretch from 2014-2016 when the All-NBA First Team centers were Joakim Noah, Marc Gasol, and DeAndre Jordan. Those are all good players, but compare that to the last few years: Anthony Davis, Jokic, and one of Embiid/Jokic this year. Definitely a huge upgrade in top-tier centers."
Because he stat-padded and people fell for it. That season he defended less 3s than DeAndre Jordan.
"All-NBA should not be by position, just the best 15 players. It boggles the mind that peak Blake Griffin never made the 1st team but DeAndre Jordan did."
"The center position has a smaller pool of people who can play it and is more prone to fluctuations in the pool of nba bound talent.   That's how Deandre Jordan made an all-nba team three times as just a dunker and a rebounder, even though he's never been as skilled as someone like Jokic or Embiid or Karl-Anthony Towns"
"Whenever the first situation happens I have never gotten frustrated. A level of respect almost comes out. But when my team plays sucky clutch defense or makes stupid boneheaded plays, or when DeAndre Jordan is on the court, you dont understand how fucking angry I get."
"He's a project, honestly, look at Rudy for what he could look like if he develops properly, similar type of player.  I don't think he'll ever get to that level but he's very similar to guys like Rudy, and in the past DeAndre Jordan, Tyson Chandler, that kind of player."
"It's comical how bad our 3rd string is at using him, but the fucker is physically talented on a level like DeAndre Jordan is. Question remains if there's a place for that kind of player in today's NBA."
lol DeAndre Jordan has given up like 3 or 4 wide open shots to Horford due to completely blown rotations  I'm convinced that he alone makes the Nets defense bad. Just an adequate defensive center would improve the defense significantly.
Still in awe of how bad DeAndre Jordan is on defense.
"First team is Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Harris, and Deandre Jordan"
"They are three very talented individual scorers, but basketball is a team sport. Their chemistry isn’t fully there yet since they haven’t played much as a team (as you can see from Harden constantly throwing the ball away due to miscommunication), and defense is a huge part of basketball. Their center Deandre Jordan is pretty trash, and he’s their only center leaving them pretty weak. Harden and KD aren’t bad defenders and Kyrie is passable for his position when he tries, but they don’t have many bench players that are very good and end up playing heavy minutes (especially with that double overtime game). Heavy minutes generally means you’re tired and when you’re tired your effort on defense generally goes down.  Even the Miami Heat big 3 in 2011 (LBJ,Wade, Bosh), lost to the Mavericks in the finals. While the Mavs are deep, Dirk was the only all star. Talent on paper doesn’t always translate to on court success (or at least it takes time adjusting to new roles, chemistry, etc.)"
"I really disagree with this, I think it’s the exact opposite. Basketball is so positionless today it’s stupid to put guys in very specific positions especially when there are contract incentives. A player shouldn’t miss out on a supermax because what their position is subjectively listed at. And like Deandre Jordan shouldn’t also be a supermax player while someone like Kawhi or Embiid or Jokic won’t be. And the all star teams are actually teams that play games, all nba teams are just a imaginary team"
"You got shammets contract, Joe Harris, Deandre Jordan and somehow some picks left. Still got RHJ MKG, Rondae, Dedmon, Joakim, Roberson. Sixers got more problems slowing down the nets then vice versa"
We acting like Gobert isn't a glorified DeAndre Jordan?
"Rockets def have the largest shift   But if you bring back lob city Deandre Jordan, that alone ups the Nets finals appearance chances significantly imo"
I think that going from current barely-an-NBA-player DeAndre Jordan to peak Clippers DeAndre Jordan would be such a massive improvement that it would be the Nets. The current defense and rebounding weakness they have would be largely erased. They'd also get Heat Tyler Johnson and whatever the best version of Jeff Green was.   The 2013-2014 Nets could be another answer for the second question.  Deron Williams/Shaun Livingston   Joe Johnson/Jason Terry   Paul Pierce/Andrei Kirilenko   Kevin Garnett/Mirza Teletovic   Brook Lopez/Mason Plumlee
"The Brooklyn Nets defense will be good. A four game sample size is a small sample size. Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Reggie Perry got playing time in those games too. The Brooklyn Nets don’t need to bring in a center, especially not JaVale McGee. DeAndre Jordan is fine.  The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the championship."
Chris Paul is so much more likeable since he left the Clippers.  So are Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.  Just how much of an asshole is Doc Rivers?
I’m sure Harrell can guard deandre jordan
"Two biggest holes are depth and DeAndre Jordan, at least one of those can be addressed in the buyout market. Like 7-11 on their bench are barely better than g-leaguers. Even washed up vets would be a serious improvement."
I'm sure clippers will roast our defense but I don't we match up as poorly as we typically do. Clippers don't have as much speed and size to truly abuse Deandre Jordan. They have a more resilient offense which can score over the best
"The Nets have a DeAndre Jordan issue and a depth issue. If they stay healthy they can make due without depth, but they need a solution at the 5 spot or they aren't contending."
If your measure of ability is efficiency then DeAndre Jordan is the best player in the NBA...  Trae Young TS%: 57.8%  Malcolm Brogdon TS%: 57.6%  Now please tell me who is more efficient??? You are a casual that doesn’t understand how the game is played.
No championship team has ever had a weakness like DeAndre Jordan.  They're not going to win a championship unless they get even just a replacement-level center.
"What are you smoking, Hunter wasn't even in the league in 2016 and he clearly said DeAndre Jordan before"
And deandre Jordan hasn't made all NBA
deandre jordan nba superstar
Mavs got rid of DSJ and DeAndre Jordan... and got an all star type player when 100%... how is even close. Oh yeah and the Knicks just threw THJ in and he’s been great
And yet  DeAndre Jordan is the starting centre for a team that's most likely headed to the finals while the mavs are fighting for a playoffs spot. Really makes you think.
They won the trade by a lot. DeAndre Jordan and DSJ are complete garbage
"I don't think he's necessarily overrated, but I'm not sure everyone realizes how not good Deandre Jordan is."
Teams already have plenty of tape on Jarrett Allen so he is already in that overpay territory for his next contract.   Allen has been the Nets starting Center for 3yrs. Before he was traded he was back to starting over DeAndre Jordan. It’s not like he’s this unknown product like Mo Bamba.    He’s a proven 11pts 10reb player at this stage of his career and could develop a jumper but the Nets didn’t prioritize the midrange. They were more interested in Lobs and Blocks. He had a midrange shot in college.   Allen has said over the summer he wants a Clint Capela 5yr/$90m at minimum and that’s when the Nets hit a snag in negotiations to re sign.
Stat padding big man that can be a liability down the stretch of a close game. He has regressed so far this season in win shares but will definitely be an upgrade to deandre Jordan.

"I’m a representative of my own opinion. It has nothing to do with the Nets doing bad. It helps my point, but they undeniably suck. They have no rebounding. They have no replacement centers, just Deandre Jordan. Oh and whose fault is that? Who did they trade Jarrett Allen off for?   I’ll continue to believe they’ll lose even if they place well in the regular season too. They’ll die down in the playoffs and when their team’s ability to succeed is really tested. I’ll continue believing that even if they place first in the East and Harden wins MVP."
Bigs are all circling the corpse of Deandre Jordan on their schedule. Man has the nets paint been under siege.  They’ll get it together somehow though.
"Not really? Joe Harris is elite and Jeff green is solid, Deandre jordan is a backup at best but I gurantee they find help before the playoffs."
Is Deandre Jordan really that washed?
"As of now no, it’s clear they need another defensive wing and center. They have DeAndre Jordan and Jeff Green serving as their centers, that isn’t good enough to be a good defense.   But they will address those issues and be much better defensively. All they need to do is become an average defense to get to the next level."
"Holy hell the officiating in this game was as bad as I’ve seen in a while. Credit to Bam on a great offensive game though, dude was just not missing.  In other news.... what the shit got into Harden??? He needs to be waaaaay more aggressive if we’re going to be competitive. He looked flat all game and didn’t really give much effort on defense.  Side note, credit to Deandre Jordan for not being absolutely terrible tonight."
I guarantee you he would have dropped 40 even with both of them playing. Who tf do the Nets have that will stop Bam? The ghost of Deandre Jordan?
"I can’t remember her name but I think a WNBA MVP winner called out either boogie or Deandre Jordan, saying she’d beat him 1-1. I’m sure someone whose better with names will clarify the people I mean"
matchup of 2 of the best shooters in the nba   Bam Adebayo and DeAndre Jordan
So? Chris Broussard “reported” that Mark Cuban was stalking Deandre Jordan.  Jalen’s media career does not rely on fact-driven journalism. There are no repercussions to his “credibility” taking a hit
I knew Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan are still friends. People made it seem they aren't friends anymore since they don't publicize their friendship anymore
"He wasn't going to re-join the Clippers because he felt the trade to Detroit betrayed him, and DeAndre Jordan who he's close with was already on the Nets. I believe the Nets will be the top team coming out of the East, before the addition of Griffin, so it's a no brainer. They'll have to overcome a Philly team which is impressive. Going out West would mean encountering many talented teams in the playoffs; Lakers, Clippers, Jazz, Suns, Warriors, Nuggets, Blazers and so on..."
"LeBron isn’t budging from top 2. Lebron, at age 36, losing to KD, Harden, Kyrie, Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, etc. would not drop him in all time rankings."
"Which has jack shit to do with **isolation scoring**...which was the topic  Deandre Jordan has higher efficiency than both Dame and KD, but it doesn't make him an efficient Iso scorer"
"Who do they have to guard Embiid, washed Deandre Jordan? The Sixers also have probably the best defensive answer to KD in the league in Simmons, lots of capable wing defenders to throw at the others in Thybulle/Green/etc., elite rim protection from Embiid, great spacing even with Simmons out there, and an improved Tobias Harris.   I would favor the Nets. But the Sixers do have some mismatches that work for them, so to say they don't have *anything* seems inaccurate to me."
"Early 2010s was what? Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard &amp; Joakim Noah?       Mid 2010s: Marc Gasol, Boogie, Deandre Jordan, Drummond?          Theres Duncan and AD too but are they noted as Power Forwards?"
Imagine having a front court of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan five years ago
"To be fair, while I'm not expecting much out of Griffin, a lot of things you just said to describe Griffin could've also been applied to DeAndre Jordan earlier this year. Then as soon as the Harden trade went down, Jordan started to look like a passable starting center again. So it's definitely not a given that he'll look better on the Nets but it's certainly not out of the question either."
"Bro Blake is not a all NBA quality player anymore, cmon. Also who’s the 4th? Deandre Jordan? Lmao."
"I think there’s more to it than that. There really was a lull in talent at the position after Shaq. This became especially apparent in the early ‘10s. Tyson Chandler, Andrew Bynum, Deandre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Joakim Noah, were all on All-NBA teams despite being fringe all-stars at best.   The early 2000s was before the 3-Point revolution and yet centers were not winning. I’d go so far to say, outside of Shaq, there wasn’t that much of talent at the 5 in the early 2000s either"
LMAO that guy really made a career out of catching lobs from the POINT GOD blake griffin and deandre jordan
"Rebounds is way more untouchable than steals. Wilt has almost 24,000 and Dwight is the next closet active player at 14000. He would need to average 10 a game for more than 12 years.  The next closest is deandre Jordan at 9700.   People forget that wilt averaged 23 rebounds a game for over 1000 games"
"I think Bucks and 76ers have a real shot of beating Brooklyn. Both Giannis and Simmons are basically the only guys you can expect to defend KD. Deandre Jordan will either be at the 3 point line with Lopez, or getting dominated by Embiid. Holiday and Middleton are about as good as it gets for defense on Harden and Kyrie. Sizers having somebody like Thybulle will help too. Nobody on the Nets can hope to stop Giannis.  Point is Nets have weaknesses that are very visible."
"ah. i assumed 'real' meant at least close to allstar level, or at least at the level of Deandre Jordan when he was part of lob city (i do note DJ was an allstar reserve in 2017)"
To all those who are amazed by between the legs dunks....I think there were 3 or 4 from that contest that were better than the ones tonight.   Even DeAndre Jordan banged one out.  Kenny the Jet trying to say it's worth a 10....lol maybe back in the mid 2000s if you do it the way JRich did it.
The Nets also got DeAndre Jordan from that Clippers team lol
"I really wish we could get a 3 point contest with bad shooters, would be super entertaining   Just imagine how amazing a shootout between Westbrook, Simmons, Giannis, Gobert, Deandre Jordan, and Andre Roberson would be"
DEANDRE JORDAN AND BLAKE REUINTED
Hyland Deandre Jordan
Good response. A lot of players are scared of getting posterized - DeAndre Jordan seems to just stand under the fucking basket despite being 7’ and just give up free points. You can’t just give the opposition a free basket just because you’re scared of social media lol. I genuinely believe social media has led players to play more scared because they’re afraid they’ll be on the receiving end of a highlight.
"&gt;On March 10, 2013 Knight died in a game vs the Los Angeles Clippers. The cause of death was determined to be DeAndre Jordan.      &gt;   &gt;Jordan was bought up on 1st degree murder charges on March 10, 2013, in his monstrous assassination of Detroit Pistons guard Brandon Knight.   &gt;   &gt;Knight died in mid-air."
I need DeAndre Jordan to massacre Kyle Kuzma in the same fashion he did Brandon Knight. Oop coming from Harden. That'd be perfect.

"Wym, they got Deandre Jordan?"
Side note: Deandre Jordan was a beast in the year he won All NBA first team.
"Even the past year the center position in All NBA was kind of redundant. AD was listed as a PF but was put as a center because, well, he plays some minutes as a center so why not use that loophole. It would've been so much easy to just put frontcourt and backcourt and skip all of the ""AD's not a center"" arguments.  Also remember when DeAndre Jordan was selected as first team because that year there werent many great centers but they had to fill that position?"
Lol well no one's going to call you a good post defender because you guard someone like DeAndre Jordan really well.
"I did a search.  Doesn't show me top 10 but shows me 11-20.  Criteria I used was personal fouls = 0, minutes played greater than or equal to 20, 6 or more field goals attempted, and turnovers = 0.  Robin Lopez, Shaun Livingston, DeAndre Jordan, Dante Cunningham, Dan Buse, Danny Ainge, Randy Wittman, Dennis Rodman, David Lee, and Ended Lantern."
*3rd team behind deandre jordan
$200 million dollar glorified DeAndre Jordan
draymond was top 10 that season and should have made all-nba first team over deandre jordan
DeAndre Jordan is his number 2
"Wilt didn't have (or at least didn't show) the outside shooting that Jokic has, though. I know there's that clip of him making 3pt hook shots in practice, but that's practice - reportedly DeAndre Jordan can make FTs in practice.   In terms of production/dominance I'd put Wilt and Shaq above Jokic, but in terms of ""diverse skillset"" I'd give Jokic the nod over them."
"Lmao the mental image of Ayton trying to D up Booker, with CP3 screaming at him like he's DeAndre Jordan."

Tyronn Lue and Deandre Jordan
Like a young Deandre Jordan
"He literally said... The only three guys I know that could get up there for these type of alley-oop dunks were younger versions of Lebron, Faried and Deandre Jordan. Faried is not in the nba."
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
"First RAPTOR does factor variables outside of the boxscore as it uses a combination of his on/off with teammates on/offs in different combinations. His impact should be shown in RAPTOR. He is one of the most efficient players in the league because he only finishes at the rim and while being assisted. Deandre Jordan is even more efficient than him, but that doesn't say much.   He is a great pick and roll threat, but a good team that can plan for that can expose him on offense. He doesn't have a lot of tools on offense."
"Calm down, sixers are actually one of the better equipped team to deal with them. Multiple good/great defensive players with a rim protector in embiid/Howard. Plus, Nets are still lacking a good big man. I just don't think DeAndre Jordan is good enough"
"Worst fan take:  *After 1-3 bad games that an all star/MVP level player is trash/overhated/washed/exposed (aka those weird Facebook people that create accounts just to hate on like one player)  Worst YouTube Take: Lonzo Ball is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical  Worst Media/NBA Award: 2016 All NBA  Deandre Jordan being voted 1st team All NBA tied with James Harden not making any All NBA team (Kyle Lowry, CP3, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook and Damien Lillard) being guards who made it over him"
"The Old Generation of in game dunkers like Dwight, Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan are dying out.  I hope the new generation brings in some new in game dunkers. Doesn't seem to be much great in game dunkers these days."
"It's ridiculous... fans willing to give up on Porziņģis after 1.25 seasons is insane.   Also any team with Luka will not be tanking for a top 5 pick. They will be a 30 win team still and get a 8-10 pick. Would Luka, Brunson and a top 10 pick even be good? Chances are we draft another Dennis Smith Jr player.   Also if we get rid of Porziņģis who are we signing in free agency? Dallas' biggest free agent signings in 20 years have been Chandler Parsons, a AARP Vince Carter, 12 ppg Shawn Marion, Erick Dampier, Monta Ellis, DeAndre Jordan (2nd attempt), Wes Matthews post ACL, and Harrison Barnes to a max contract. Porziņģis has been better than all of those guys but gets more hate than all of them... And KP has hardly been the first player making max money. Parsons and Barnes both got max contracts and played worse than Porziņģis has. Dampier was our highest paid player during Dirk's prime and was a bench player."

"Until people started gifting all star spots to Deandre Jordan, Trae Young. Ofcourse winning matters, having good stats on heavily losing team means you are playing shitty basketball. If those tanking teams are not so casual, and blatant they would never have low 20 wins season."
TBF if the Nets had Deandre Jordan or James Harden on their O-line they probably would’ve won
Either brooklyn doesnt win or he gets cut from the team before playoffs.   2019: goes to GSW. They lost in the finals.   2020: lakers cut him before playoffs. They win it all.   The math isnt wrong. Dont sign him brooklyn.   Instead trade for McCaw who is unbeaten in the playoffs when hes not injured.   I'll give him to you for DeAndre Jordan.
"Deandre Jordan has one first team all nba, embiid has none, I think this trade is very fair"
DeAndre Jordan Clarkson better
"Kyrie has a hard time keeping his opponent in front of him, which can be costly when its Deandre Jordan as your last line of defense.  Maybe its a different story this year."
"He is a big. Bigs' game does not ""age horribly"" barring serious injuries.  Bigs of his caliber were playing high level basketball deep in their 30s. Can't say the same about guards who once they lose their explosion, suddenly their shots are contested, their passes coming out of worse circumstances and ofc their d takes a dive...  I will never understand why people say that about Giannis. Guy is a finishing god athleticism or no athleticism he can put the ball in, based on his length and ability to use angles alone. As a more traditional big he would have been tough to stop no matter his age (if someone else was feeding him).  People are acting that he is DeAndre Jordan, athleticism and nothing else all the while those guys could barely score double figures PPG even in their prime. Giannis is scoring close to 30 for years now..."
"Tbh yes I did see the potential in Bruce Brown, Shamet is still playing worse than he has in past seasons, and Jeff Green was really good this year without Harden too. This is not to say Harden isn't one of the best floor raisers, but those are kind of poor examples. The example I would've used is DeAndre Jordan who was a bona fide scrub this season before Harden and has turned into a passable starting center with Harden."
"Doc just doesn't carry weight with me on these topics. Every coach fluffs their guys, but he legit convinced people DeAndre Jordan was a DPOTY candidate at a point where he was still a defensive minus."
That’s true but unless you’re a historically good 3 pt shooter like Steph Curry it’s still not enough to make for the difference. That’s why the all time leaders in TS% are Deandre Jordan and Tyson Chandler.  Not a lot of shooters on that list
It's because DeAndre Jordan gets a lot more minutes in games vs sub .500 teams.  While the Nets best defensive lineup has Jeff Green in for DeAndre Jordan as a small 5.
"If AD &amp; Schroder come back 100%, it's theirs to lose, even with Brooklyn in the mix.  The Lakers have as many bodies as anyone to throw at KD &amp; Harden and the tools to expose &amp; punish the Nets weakness.  If any of Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan or Bruce Brown are seeing significant playing time as the Nets nominal 5, AD &amp; LeBron will eat them alive inside.  Without AD at 100% the Lakers don't have the firepower to compete and you could see them losing to Utah or the Clippers."
"I’ve seen him pull off some impressive post moves. But yeah, he’s super uncoordinated and raw. Seems like he’ll be a Jarret Allen/DeAndre Jordan type of player."
Nets don't get out of the east. Deandre Jordan guarding Embiid for 7 games?
"Idk, DeAndre Jordan never dropped 40 off the bench..."
"Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are technically on non max deals.  They both took small pay cuts, their deals each had several bonus clauses, then the Nets signed their off season moves in such an order to add DeAndre Jordan at close to 10M a year over 4 years."
"See that's also an oversimplification.   Yes, ideally Tatum needs to be more efficient. I'm not going to argue there.    However, the mistake you're making is assuming players should be compared to league averages and not team averages. I would love for Tatum to defer his shots to LeBron James more frequently, but unfortunately, we don't have LeBron James on the team.   Tatum often can't pass out of a bad shot because if he passes out we get an even worse shot. He can't defer to Jeff Teague, Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.   Kyrie on the other hand, had: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. There were guys he could have deferred to. Instead, he took shots away from them to focus on his own volume stats.  There is an argument to be said that Tatum could offload a couple of extra scoring attempts (and I've been wary of his low assist numbers and poor body language lately), but we really need him scoring ~20-25ppg at least, even at this efficiency because we can't get those points in a more efficient way.   &gt;Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?  No.   Because as much as Tatum has struggled recently:  1. His efficiency isn't bad for a perimeter player (TS% is warped by highly efficient bigs on low volume) 2. His efficiency needs to be seen in the context of the team, not the league."
"Alright cool, so how about your boy Jayson Tatum? He's shooting below league average TS%. Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?"
"That's not the argument at all.   &gt;Deandre Jordan or Kevin Durant as a scorer? Sure KD puts up a hyper efficient 30 a game, but Jordan's is more efficient, so wouldnt you take him?  You're using a very generic TS% argument that doesn't actually apply. In the Durant/DJ comparison, both have positive efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a positive addition, therefore you want more of them.   Deandre Jordan = +12  Kevin Durant = +27  +27 &gt; + 12   In the Kyrie/Kemba comparison, both have negative efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a negative subtraction so you actually want less of them.   Kyrie Irving = -21  Kemba Walker = -17  -17 &gt; - 21  It's basic number line math. More negatives is not more good. A guy scoring poorly isn't helping you by scoring even more poorly.   Another example is Carmelo Anthony. Would you rather have Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a star or Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a role player?  At this point in his career, Carmelo Anthony trying to score 20ppg is detrimental to his team, he's better off scoring in a limited capacity and letting other guys take the shots instead.  &gt; so for all intents and purposes, Kemba and Kyrie are on the same level of inefficiency during these selected spans.  And for all intents and purposes, when Kyrie was sucking ass through a straw he tried to be the hero and got in everyone's way. When Kemba was sucking ass through a straw he let the Jays take over as the #1 and #2 options."
"Basically this argument is that volume doesnt matter at all. Would you rather have Deandre Jordan or Kevin Durant as a scorer? Sure KD puts up a hyper efficient 30 a game, but Jordan's is more efficient, so wouldnt you take him?  Not to mention, like I said earlier, scoring is less efficient on average in the playoffs than in the regular season so for all intents and purposes, Kemba and Kyrie are on the same level of inefficiency during these selected spans."
How can you possibly forget the all time leader in FG% DeAndre Jordan ?
&gt;Clippers series in 2017 (which wasn’t a very big team).  DeAndre Jordan averaged 38 minutes per game that series and is as traditional a big man as they come.
"It was moratorium, Hayward could’ve just noped out like Deandre Jordan and Hayward’s agent isn’t dumb. It’s not like this was a surprise. They were having discussions with Charlotte already."
"That's just what people have called him for years. Its better than typing out his whole name and in reference to the Spurs, calling him our star, it is pretty self explanatory. I'm not calling him DJ when we're gonna be playing, like, the Nets or something. Lol because DeAndre Jordan is a more famous DJ."
"Lmao, Harden literally woulda won it all if an older CP3, the only good star he ever had in Houston, doesn't get injured when they're up 3-2 on the greatest team ever. He beats GSW, then easily beats Cleveland... and they weren't even a stacked team, most of those role players had career years because of Harden  You guys are undoubtedly better with Harden instead of Brown and Kemba. Harden has made Bruce Brown, TLC and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan into good role players now that he's in Brooklyn in games without KD or Kyrie. Harden with Tatum, Smart (when healthy) and role players? They're a Top 5 team already"
He was really athletic and I think teams were projecting him as maybe a deandre jordan who could be a roll man and catch lobs and score on putbacks.    But that requires things like BBIQ and hand eye coordination which I'm not sure noel had.
"Sheesh.   I would say Isaiah Thomas, but he was injured to start the 2017-18 season. Maybe DeAndre Jordan?"
"You can it’s old or it’s eye test it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a bullshit stat and anyone who gives it any credibility is a moron!   So Russ needs to tone down his volume because he’s inefficient as TS% would supposedly show But Joe Ingles who’s #2 in the league wouldn’t do well with increased volume. So what’s the point of the stat? To add 3 numbers and divide?   A 90% FT shooter is going to shoot 90% or there about whether you increase or decrease their volume.  Why is it TS%, if it’s “objective” &amp; shows “efficiency” Why can’t that be applied?   Here’s all you need to know about efficiency and how objective TS% is   All time list  Deandre Jordan is #2 all time  Steph #5 Adrian Dantley is #8 Kyle Korver #24  Lebron #46 Michael Jordan #98 Larry bird #112 Kobe #218  So you tell me who is more efficient at scoring The eye test or the bullshit stat crowd?"
"Doncic is the epitomin of modern basketball. He was MVP in the second best League in the world at 19. Playing proffesionaly since being 15. It was a no brainer that you should take the kid 1st unless there is a Lebron, Jordan or Anthony Davis in the draft.  There is no reason to take a decent prospect at the ""least"" valuable position today and not take the best prospect available since ever.  You can somehow argue Hakeem over Jordan. Iverson over Kobe. Harden over Curry. But there is absolutely no argument for Ayton over Doncic. Most draft ""experts"" put DeAndre at 1st because they knew the connection with the Suns owner and his intentions to pick him first. It was ""cheap"" win that they predicted the 1st, so that they can advertised themselfs as experts .."
"High efficiency, low usage big men on good offenses always have great offensive ratings. Tyson Chandler and DeAndre Jordan have both led the league multiple times. It's not a very meaningful stat. If you put Nerlens Noel on the Clippers in Zubac's place he'd probably have similar numbers"
No one in the league shoots 61% from the floor and put up 25 a game. Maybe DeAndre Jordan and his 10 a game on 5 lobs.
I mean Jokic had similar statline 19 10 6 couple of years ago and Deandre Jordan who was already washed got in. And Nuggets were in playoff contention.
"Jokic has physically dominated guys like AD, Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, he absolutely can do that. He’s just generally more valuable as an elite passer and shooter who occasionally posts up than a pure post player, but it doesn’t mean he can’t when he wants to."
"If you’re one of the best big man dunkers in the league... deandre Jordan, capela, Andre Drummond... people don’t care when you can’t shoot 3s... well Steve Novak was 100% one of the best 3 point shooters the entire time he played in the league. So he gets a pass on being one dimensional"
Dallas gets their guy DeAndre Jordan.
"Well yea no shit, they signed basically the second free agency started and talking to them before hand is tampering, what do you expect them to say? “Yea so go ahead and fine the nets for tampering because we’ve been talking for a few weeks now”. Part of the deal was that DeAndre Jordan signed with the nets too, did the nets front office just magically know that when kyrie and KD’s deals were structured in a way that saved room for Jordan? Use your head  Do you think Kemba signed with the Celtics without and conversations before hand?"
"He's also a really, really impactful offensive player...their whole offense is built around the threat of him rim-running. (Kinda like how DeAndre Jordan was actually a very positive offensive player in his prime)"
I really do believe DeAndre Jordan has the potential to become a top 10 Center in this league. Or am I drunk?
"&gt;Just like Kawhi?  Kawhi just wanted to play in LA, not in another country. It's a pure geographical reason as to why. I don't think Harden loved living in Brooklyn more than he did in Houston, so I doubt that's why he wanted to get traded  &gt;Jaylen Brown is likely to earn himself some All-NBA honors, starting this year.   Cool? Siakam was All NBA 2nd team last year, was he a superstar? Or anything close to it? Lmao  &gt;It also in no way would be a 1 for 1 Brown for Harden. The rumors were minimum Brown, Smart, bench players, and picks.   No, there were also rumors that you didn't need to throw in Smart too; the focal point was Brown and throwing in Kemba with some of your bad bench players (who aren't fucking helping you anyway, as most Celtics fans even admit) and picks (which you've miffed on for a while now) woulda been a better offer than Brookyln's. Just depends on if Ainge is willing to give up his war chest  &gt;So there's a future All-Star/All-NBA, a first team All-Defense, and then the picks you'd need to refill the bench you just traded away.   Still worth it, even if you gave up Brown. You're trying to tack on accolades to make it seem like you're giving up an insane amount but you're really not. DeAndre Jordan was 1st Team All NBA in 2016 or 17 I believe but he's nowhere near superstar level even in his peak.  &gt;Tatum and Harden cannot win the championship with role players.  Harden *alone* is capable of taking a bunch of bum role players to the 2nd round at least, and in the East that would be the Conference Finals, which has been your ceiling with the Jays. Do you fucking realize what he's doing with the corpse of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green and other forgotten role players like Bruce Brown, TLC and Tyler Johnson?  Harden, Tatum, Smart, Tucker (assuming you added him as a solid vet rotational piece at the wing position who works well with Harden) and any Center who knows how to catch lobs is much better than you have now. It's also arguably better than the Nets pre Harden trade  &gt;Their primes are 5 years away. Everyone compares them to players who are 28+ when Brown is only 24.  Lmao, this is what's wrong with fanbases of this sub. Everyone says ""THEY'RE ONLY 24, THEY'RE NOT IN THEIR PRIME"" when defending their coveted young prospects as an excuse not to take the necessary risks to win when in reality being 24 means you're already in your prime.   This is about as good as Brown is going to be, especially considering his super hot shooting numbers are arguably statistically unsustainable and will continue to fall by the end of the year into the playoffs. That'll be the case pretty soon with Tatum. You need to realize you're in win now mode, and if you haven't made the Finals in the next couple years they'll want out  I get it; you're attached to your guys. Jaylen Brown is a stand up guy and great player. However, if your goal is to win a Championship, then you'll take the risks you have to in order to make it work."
"I'm not guaranteeing anything, still the lack of size is has the potential to be a major problem.  Nets need another big and for DeAndre Jordan to un-wash himself.  Embiid might average 45 against the Nets over a 7 game series if it's up to Jeff Green to slow him down."
"Embiid has been sonning Deandre Jordan for the last three years and he's basically they're best big the nets have. It's not a talent question, it's a matchup question"
"When all they have is Deandre Jordan to guard him and the Nets likely going small on a frequent basis, I wouldn’t put it past Embiid to average 40 &amp; 20 in that series."
"Not really. He averaged 25.7 points in that series which was just 1.2 points under his regular season average.   I still get what you mean though. You’re basically saying you need multiple all-defensive caliber big men to stop Giannis, basically like the Heat and Raptors. Who do the Nets have? Deandre Jordan? Jeff Green? The Nets are better than us and probably beat us but I guarantee you it won’t come at the hands of Giannis underperforming"
"Because I don't like KD for going to Golden State when the NBA could've been as awesome as the 2016 seasons for the next few years, I don't like James Harden's game and the fact that he thinks it's okay to go to the club during covid while his teammates and coach had to answer for him to the media. And I don't like that Deandre Jordan is getting paid that much just because he's friends with KD and Kyrie.  Lot of love for Bruce Brown and Dre Roberson tho, hopefully those guys succeed"
Devils advocate: he can space the floor even more than they are now.   Replace DeAndre Jordan with Cousins and you’re not losing much defense but you’re gaining even more offensive firepower.   They would look unstoppable to me.
You right players like deandre jordan were so much better having to play with those bums
"im not sure why you are arguing this point.  i didnt say he ISN'T versatile (im not really sure), i'm just saying calling THIS PARTICULAR STAT ""versatility"" is misleading, since any rational person would not call Harden more versatile (by definition) than the other guys there for the most part.  Not sure if this analogy is perfect but it's like, you can't say prime Deandre Jordan was one of the most accurate shooters in the league simply cos his fg% is high...you actually have to consider whats going on in that stat to explain it. So fg% shouldn't be called ""shooting versatility"" or ""shooting accuracy"". Typing that, its not a perfect analogy, but I think it conveys what i'm trying to say."
Best picked up curse since Deandre Jordan yelled “OH FUCK” on an airballed free throw
"Draymond has more than a third of his shots from the 3 point line in his career and he was shooting almost 40% from 3 in 2016. He was shooting a bigger percentage of 3s than anyone on the 1st team All-NBA in 2016 aside from Curry. He was the perfect small-ball center in 2016. If you didn't see him play back then just say it, he was no Deandre Jordan only finishing at the rim, he was the best stretch 5 in the league and the key piece of the death lineup.  He was also the best Warrior in the finals that year."
"No he doesn't. Mamba mentality is about more than just working out in the offseason.  Some of it is being kind of a dick, like publicly calling out teammates for being out of shape (Shaq) or just being bad at basketball (Smush Parker). Jordan did that too.   But I don't recall LeBron ever doing that to his teammates. Even after JR Smith's infamous blunder in Game 1, LeBron still defended him.  For all the ""LeGM"" memes, we've never seen LeBron calling his team's front office trash for not making a trade he wanted, like Kobe talking about the Lakers not trading Bynum for Kidd. And LeBron never demanded a trade either, as far as I can remember.  The closest there is to Mamba mentality in the NBA today is Chris Paul, not LeBron. CP3 is a perfectionist who calls out teammates on fitness (Harden manboobs) and for making low-IQ plays (DeAndre Jordan holding the ball as the clock expires in a tie game), which has led to some interpersonal conflict on teams he's been on - just like Kobe.  Lebron is more Duncan-like than Kobe-like. I can't recall Duncan or LeBron ever really having a problem with any teammate, even though they both played with some guys of questionable maturity (eg, Stephen Jackson, JR).   Lebron certainly never sucker-punched a teammate, like Kobe did to Samaki Walker. Kobe also got into fights with Reggie Miller and Chris Childs - similar to how CP3 has gotten into a few altercations (Rondo, Julius Hodge). The closest thing to a LeBron fight was him getting shoved by Nazr Mohammed."
PG: Chris Paul SG: Khris Middleton SF: Jae Crowder PF: Rui Hachimura C: DeAndre Jordan
"This was earlier, i thought he would get time over deandre jordan which i dont think he did season start"
"I think he is really underrated in part because of All-NBA snubs, people voted for Deandre Jordan or Drummond instead of the center who led his team to 60w. IMO in his last 2 years in Atl and the majority of his years in Boston he was the best center in the East and got 0 All-NBA selections and only a defensive selection. It's probably his non-flashy boxcores.  Millslap and him where a great 2 way PF and C for Atlanta that year that could switch to almost anyone. But they weren't good enough (like everyone in the East) to face the LeBron+Kyrie duo."
"Yeah considering you clearly didn’t watch the episodes i mentioned. It doesn’t use TS%, it’s pace adjusted +/- and points per 75 possessions.  We wanna use TS% then I guess DeAndre Jordan is the GOAT huh?"
"All nba center was the weakest position for half a decade hence why deandre jordan was all nba first Team one year.  And no, Danny Green would have been the fmvp."
"Tier 1: Jokic, Embiid   Tier 2: Gobert, KAT, Vucevic, Bam  Tier 3: Ayton, Nurkic, Capela  Tier 4: Turner, Drummond, Adams, Carter Jr  Tier 5: Pretty much everyone else   Tier 6: Deandre Jordan, James Wiseman"
Doc Rivers should've won another coach of the year award for ever convincing people DeAndre Jordan was a great defender. Dude was getting minor DPOTY buzz before he even broke league-average.
deandre jordan is a (former) all-NBA member AND is a perfect salary match in a trade who would provide Boston the defensive anchor they need in the paint not to mention he hustles on every possession. tbh we're OVERpaying for marcus smart
he's awful he should get traded for deandre jordan
He’s been very good. He makes some great adjustments that might be difficult to do. Getting DeAndre Jordan out of the rotation has been great but it must’ve been really hard with the two stars specifically wanting him there and taking pay cuts so he could be there.   I like what I’m seeing a least. He rarely looks lost.
That move by Lonzo Ball was cowardly. Though given how many dumbass fans think Brandon Knight got embarrassed by DeAndre Jordan it's not surprising.
5 years ago Deandre Jordan might have been the 2nd best center.   10 years ago Andrew Bogut
"Kyrie proved that take against the Bulls the other night. I know harden,  kd, and I think DeAndre Jordan too, were out but the rest of the nets aren’t total bums. Kyrie put up some big numbers but in the end a loss is a loss.   Also the only time Kyrie really has a “winning pedigree” is with LeBron James on his team who is the modern day GOAT so I totally buy that take."
"I’m pretty surprised by his underwhelming career. I figured at the least he would be a higher iq Deandre Jordan (if he never developed his offensive game whatsoever, still good for lobs on the PnR), but he hasn’t even been close to that."
Is Deandre Jordan gonna play this garbage time or is he injured?
If post offense was all muscle then Deandre Jordan wouldn’t average 10 points in his prime
Seems like deandre Jordan nowadays lol
Deandre Jordan has more All NBA selections than Kyrie??? wtf
Almost all of those players are averaging over 18 shots a game on better efficiency than tatum. It's not like I'm using DeAndre Jordan as an example lmao.    Also being a volume player isn't an excuse to be inefficient. Quite the opposite. If you are going to shoot that many times per game it HAS to be above average efficiency at least if you want to play winning basketball.    Tatum can keep chucking up over 20 shots per game on league average efficiency but his team is gonna be mediocre in the process. Case in point. The celtics are barely a playoff team
"I think it would be closer than people realize, when he wants to score he is completely unstoppable in the paint. I remember him easily backing down prime DeAndre Jordan when he was like 21, and last night he was throwing around Jerami Grant like a ragdoll. He’s a lot stronger than people realize, I mean over the past 4 years Embiid is only shooting 9/29 (30%) against him per NBA tracking, largely because he’s one of the only guys strong enough that Joel can’t just push him around like Gobert or something."
Imagine being this entitled as a fanbase.  Free agents can only sign with one team.  It's not like he pulled a DeAndre Jordan with Dallas ffs.
yall forgot that they can take away deandre jordan and have enough money for a good midlevel center
"Ok but think of dwight howard,deandre jordan,Shaq, and finally wilt. What is something they all have in common? Large hands which are proven to worsen your shooting, Heavy weight which is a important factor in free throw shooting, and tall height. Now think of Bill Russell who is 6,9 220 pounds and has about the same size hands as giannis (Which is still pretty big). The fact is people like Wilt are not supposed or should be expected to be great free throw shooters because it is close to impossible. How much sense does it make to compare someone who is of above average center size and someone who would be of small forward or power forward size today shooting?"
"You don’t think a team of Durant, Kyrie, Dinwiddie, Harris, Allen, DeAndre Jordan, LeVert, Jeff Green and Taurean Prince would have been competitive with the Lakers?"
NBA players have a long history of giving props to guys who are good in iso (offensively) and have perimeter clamps (defensively). They only remember what they've played against and don't really consider the bigger picture when giving quick answers like this.  KD and Kyrie wanted DeAndre Jordan on the Nets even tho he sucks. Old ass Jamal Crawford continued to be rated highly by players despite being garbage for the last few years of his career. Players do not make good talent evaluators.
KD and Kyrie took a slight paycut so the Nets could pay DeAndre Jordan lol
"Volume absolutely matters when comparing scoring, otherwise Deandre Jordan would be considered the best scorer in the league for averaging 6 ppg on 70 TS%. It’s cool though, you know I’m right. You just don’t like me so you don’t like admitting it lol"
"Deandre Jordan, because it probably means I’m not watching Claxton"
"Yeah, DeAndre Jordan has a bunch of the highest FG% seasons because he only took shots inside 3 ft. and he didn't take that many of them.  You're not out here to score, you just happen to do it from time to time. 13 ppg on good efficiency isn't driving anyone wild."
Intoxicated and not social media savvy. This is the same man that tweeted a picture of an emoji during the DeAndre Jordan saga.
DeAndre Jordan
"Like Michael and deandre Jordan, they’re father and son"
"Jokic, DeAndre Jordan, Demarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, Rudy Gobert, Joakim Noah, Al Jefferson. All had mediocre to downright terrible rookie seasons. And that is just to name a few.      It's like you people just talk out of your ass."
"Embiid started playing basketball at 16, watch some of his JV highlights. But if I had to give a good comparison prime Deandre Jordan who was a fucking monster"
I think he meant prime Deandre Jordan  Obviously right now DJ is not very good
&gt;Deandre Jordan. A rim running lob threat that has great defense.  Deandre Jordan and great defense don't go together
"He is essentially Deandre Jordan. A rim running lob threat that has great defense. He’s a solid center that is very good and efficient at what he does.   He’s properly rated. His skill set could be replaced. If the hawks had to replace him with someone like... Mitch Robinson or Nerlens Noel, how much is lost in terms of actual wins?"
"DeAndre Jordan. Not technically a current star but nonetheless, he’s been in our starting lineup for 2 years because he’s KD and Kyrie’s friend."
Deandre Jordan.
"Bam if he can put it all together. Right now he  reminds me of DeAndre Jordan on defense and a bit limited like Tristan Thompson on offense. But he’s still raw, lots of potential."
Ask Nets fans (from a Center position perspective) how they felt about going from Jarrett Allen to starting DeAndre Jordan.
"Drummond went 13-36 from the free throw line that game. Hacking got so bad that season that Drummond, Dwight Howard and DeAndre Jordan were shooting 20+ free throws a game on a regular basis and 10:30pm games were finishing close at close to 2am."
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"Here he is just absolutely tossing Gobert around:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDR0eHH0X2w&amp;feature=youtu.be   He’s just as strong dude. Even young Jokic was backing down prime DeAndre Jordan and stuff, he’s slow but he’s one of the strongest players in the NBA."
"The NBA salary cap is not real. Kyrie Durant and Harden are all on max deals then Joe Harris Deandre Jordan and Spencer Dinwiddie all have big deals too.  We can make it work, I don’t understand how, but it’s definitely possible."
"Alright so you would agree that a rotation of Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Chris Chiozza is bad?"
Montrezl Harrell is #5 in pts per game for all Centers. DeAndre Jordan is #29 on that list. Montrezl Harrell is one of the top scoring Centers in the league
"Using your logic deandre jordan is just as great, dude also has a great fg% so he must be able to score ""at will""and is great at ""scoring around the hoop"""
"Kyrie and Harris in the starting 5 are massive holes on defence. Joel has feasted on DeAndre Jordan (In 7 appearances he’s 6-1. In 2 games this season Joel has combined 53 pts vs Jordan’s 8). Griffin and Aldridge have looked washed defensively this season, but we have no idea if they will show up for the playoffs now on this team.  The biggest issue is they don’t have plus level defenders than can close down their matchup. Harden and KD could show up or go missing, but I’m inclined to think in the playoffs they will step up a notch and at the very least be average.   Dinwiddie is another guard who is eh defensively. Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson and Shamet won’t get heavy minutes but again are all lacklustre defensively.  The only way they can put a team out there who can play defence is if one of Jordan/Griffin/Aldridge shows up and Harden/KD take massive strides to make up for Irving and Harris. Honestly if I’m Nash I’d run Dinwiddie with Harden as much as possible and try and rotate Harris/Irving, as Dinwiddie/Harden/Irving/KD/+Big or Dinwiddie/Harden/Harris/KD/+Big is good enough to not be exposed consistently."
"The Clippers roster weren't good in 2014 because of things happening to Redick, Griffin and Jordan in 2021 ?  Blake was litterally a top 5 player in 2015 and Deandre made all nba first team lol (yeah the center spot sucked)."
KD is 6’11 or 7’0. He was was taller than Deandre Jordan and Cousins in one picture and only slightly shorter than Greg Oden in another.
"Because he has the closest in distance to the rim scoring average ever, ahead of even DeAndre Jordan...He only ever camps outside the rim, he sets no screens, he goes down low and he grows roots. He also has one of the worst ts%'s ever for a center so while he gets the rebound, he misses the shot and gets his own rebound [https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/09/01/andre-drummonds-offensive-rebounding-trick-grabbing-his-own-miss/](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/09/01/andre-drummonds-offensive-rebounding-trick-grabbing-his-own-miss/)  (From 2015 btw, it's gotten worse). Listen, I am sorry you have to watch him play every game now, I know, I did it for years, it's going to suck."
I think he’s similar to Deandre Jordan
When DeAndre Jordan is off the court our defensive rating is 6th in the league. He won’t be seeing much time now.
Embiid would have to go for 40+ against DeAndre Jordan and LaMarcus Aldridge 4/7 times
"yeah but Jaxon Hayes wasnt a 2nd overall pick. and it's like saying ""hey while steph in his prime why dont we prepare building around the next deandre jordan or something"""
He's like DeAndre Jordan if hé was taught how to play by Al Horford
Wiseman was seen as a raw big that if he puts his tools together could be like a DeAndre Jordan type. Mainly he was scouted highly due to potential.
Deandre Jordan &gt; Michael Jordan
"Nets have still won games without Kyrie, KD, and DeAndre Jordan"
"Why is it that every time I see this guy have a highlight on r/NBA, it's always some dumb alien-like shit? He's so acrobatic he legit flies through the air when he jumps. Remember his dunk during the Summer League? His poster on Reggie Jackson? Now this shit? He's easily one of the best big leapers since DeAndre Jordan in his Lob City days."
Must mean DeAndre Jordan is better than Lebron
"Coming from the fanbase that hated Deandre Jordan for like, 5 years for not signing with you."
"Yeah.  He may be washed, but he can actually give them something offensively at the 5.  And he's better than DeAndre Jordan, which isn't that hard to do."
&gt;DeAndre Jordan: solid big body  Very generous.
"to be honest I am just happy that LMA boxes out well.  DeAndre Jordan lacked the basic fundamentals of boxing out for defense rebounds.  It was annoying at best to watch.  Having a 5 man that can occasionally stretch the floor, make post moves, make the right pass quickly and atleast play decent post defense is great."
"They're not superstars. That's like saying Gary Payton on the 2006 Heat was a superstar. That's like saying Tracy Mcgrady on the 2013/14 Spurs was a superstar.  IF the nets go far in the playoffs (a big IF considering the Heat and Bucks are on par and them+76ers+possibly the celtics are all definitely better if KD is not 100%) then LMA and Blake will be far down the list of players who contribute the most to their success.  Here, I'll order it:  Tier 1: Harden, KD  Tier 2: Kyrie  Tier 3: Joe Harris, Jeff green, Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown  Tier 4: Landry Shamet, Luwawu-Cabarrot, Nic Claxton, LMA, Blake  That means Blake and LMA will be somewhere between the 8th and 12th most valuable contributors in the postseason when that level of player usually gets 8 minutes a game.  Really? Have their not been enough changes to benefit small market teams?  Apparently it's impossible for small market teams to win. Only big market teams like the... San Antonio Spurs can win a title or 5.  You know, if a front office focuses on player development, asset management, coaching and infrastructure rather than whining to the league when the nets or lakers sign a guy to play 14 minutes per game in the postseason, (god forbid giving up a 2029 2nd rounder to take Drummond away from the Lakers buyout option) then they too could succeed rather than infringing on freedom of player movement.  Honestly, the small market crocodile tears are pathetic."
"Deandre Jordan is still a beast because the commenter ""has like 6 of his Clippers jerseys in my bedroom."""
LMA and Griffin help.  Thats how bad DeAndre Jordan was.    You dont need to be better than league average to get better.  You just need to be better than who your replacing.
"Deandre Jordan my dude. DJ is one of the worst starters in the entire league but plays most of his minutes next to Harden, because Harden is the only player capable of making him look not that bad"
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
Imagine Wiseman playing under Pops. He would use Wiseman differently instead of just doing alley oops just  like Deandre Jordan.
Unfortunately they would then play Deandre Jordan over him
"DeAndre Jordan is the FG% career leader.  He prob would have scored a similar number of points but can’t pass like LMA and clogs the paint.    But it was a strange game, dont know why the Hornets collapsed on him like they did.  The Nets were taking advantage from behind the arc."
He was jumping and attempting to contest shots on everyone that came to the paint tonight  Deandre Jordan don’t jump for shit but Lobs
"'him not being deandre jordan is great' is rude but also the truth 😭😭😭  i think that against teams that have a lot pull up shooters, we will rely on Claxton+Blake/Jeff"
+22 is a bit misleading the whole starting lineup went off but yeah he looked solid.   Him not being Deandre Jordan is great. I am worried about his defense against pull up shooters. Not sure he’s gonna hold up well against a lot of teams but he brings a lot offensively still.
I understand. Idk what his case was in San Antonio but he was been 100x better than Deandre Jordan.
"I don’t know how he was for you guys, but Jesus Christ is he an upgrade over Deandre Jordan, who saw NO MINUTES tonight"
Deandre Jordan should play 0 minutes the rest of the season
"I don't think people realize exactly how horrible DeAndre Jordan is.  Like they know he's bad, but don't realize *how* bad."
"DeAndre Jordan there to stink it up though, but overall nets Offense&gt; nuggets but nuggets lesser weaknesses"
"I mean Jokic is strong as fuck too, he was backing down prime DeAndre Jordan when he was like 21. But if you’re taking pure surface area:volume ratio I think it goes to Harden."
"It may be league average but he’s putting up 18.2ppg and taking 14.4 shots a game, takes tough shots, and fits the warriors offense very well. Plus TS is skewed by centers who take most of their shots around the rim. Alex Len 67.%, deandre Jordan 76.8%, Wendell carter jr 86.7% yet I don’t think anybody would call them better scorers than Wiggins.   You’re also underrating his defense. He guards the teams best wing and sometimes guards and should probably at least make all defense 3rd team."
Harden plays with the second unit and more minutes than anyone else on the team. look up the numbers with and without Deandre Jordan
In the 2018 season the Cavs where only 1.9 better with LeBron on the field. This year Vucevic has a worse on/off than DeAndre Jordan. OKC is better when SGA doesn't play. On/off isn't a perfect stat.
It's literally DeAndre Jordan. He's that bad.  I posted the Harden's numbers with Jordan on/off the court above. It's insane.
DeAndre Jordan being in his most played 4/5 man lineups explains it
"I didn't think he brought much to the table...but then I looked at exactly how bad DeAndre has been and have changed my mind.  The Nets are 19-3 in their last 22 games. In those games...  DeAndre on the floor: -0.9 Net Rating in 508 minutes   DeAndre off the floor: +11.5 Net Rating in 553 minutes  And by basic +/-  DeAndre on the floor: -6 in 508 minutes   DeAndre off the floor: +144 in 553 minutes  Aldridge can't be any worse on defense than Jordan is. He is most likely much better on offense, however, so by default he should be better than Jordan.  So if Jordan just completely stops playing and all of his minutes go to Claxton/Aldridge/Blake, it should be a pretty nice upgrade."
"Here's the copypasta, more or less.  - Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  - Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  - Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  - Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  - Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  - Ran ISO-ball all the time  - Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy  - Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy shit he said to the team  - Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team  - Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed  - Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy shit like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired  - Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts  - Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job  - All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed  - He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're shit, go take his job""  - Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc) No preparation. He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes Not to mention that he was just a really horrible coach. I'm sure I left out a lot of stuff.  Post-coaching shitty things he did:  - Saying rim protectors are obsolete, which threw shade on Bogut, and then saying Deandre Jordan was the DPOY (over Draymond) because of his rim protection  - Wanting to take credit for Kerr's success talking about caterpillars and butterflies  - Saying Curry was not the MVP, which is fair, but not what you expect someone to say when Curry went to bat to keep Jackson's job. Maybe thought Curry didn't try hard enough, which is bullshit since Curry tried very hard and stumped for Jackson personally  - Saying Curry was ruining the game"
"Drummond is playing more passive than DeAndre Jordan, considering the years."
Deandre Jordan....thanks
"I feel like we should call a board-wide moratorium on referring to Deandre Jordan by only his last name. He has to be Deandre, DJ, or his full name."
he had the same vertical at the combine as deandre jordan if im remembering correctly
"Even lower?  Since the league moved to 3 All-NBA teams in 1989 there are only 5 players (Draymond, Jokic, Ginobili, DeAndre Jordan, and Marc Gasol) who have made more than 1 all-NBA team.  That's 5 players in about 840 draft picks.  This isn't a gotcha."
&gt; I think he’s the most important player on this team outside of the big 3.  I mean that was pretty obvious once Allen and LeVert were gone. Not like DeAndre Jordan or Tyler Johnson have been lighting it up...
"I believe KG and Deandre Jordan have both had blocks like that for people who've never seen it before. Marcus smart has done this too but doesn't look as impressive.   This is a good one for sure, but is mainly due to a tough pass by Booker and Ayton being behind the ball. Bit of a mishap on their end led to this being within Pats reach."
&gt; he can play post better than Jordan  And we don't mean DeAndre
"&gt;It is, which is why he is lower in RAPTOR.  And lower in the others? RAPTOR seems to be about as effective at predicting value as all of those other stats I listed. Why are you just picking RAPTOR? I included RAPTOR even though Randle is higher because I didn't want to be dishonest, why did you ignore the others?  &gt; You know that Randle doesn't just isolate and score or stand next to the rim or something? If that's what it was, then why wouldn't everyone do it? He is playing as a point-forward, where he initiates a lot of offence and makes plays for others   &gt;That the biggest part of his value? It's exactly what he brings to the table that Zion doesn't. Zion can't do that despite dominating the ball.   I meant to say Zion here not Randle. All of those things listed are things that Zion does   &gt;Wait so when you bring up advanced metrics to highlight Zions value that is all good, but the metrics lie when they highlight Randles value. That's pretty convenient.  Defensice metrics are one thing, overall impact metrics are another. The biggest downside of impact metrics are the defensive aspect, often with the defensive part just being overall impact minus estimated offensive impact   &gt;Basically all of the players can play defense, or rebound extremely well, or stretch the floor. Zion can do none of those things.   There are players in the league right now that can literally do just one of those things you listed. Zion is a multifaceted attacked and creator and he does so in a unique way    &gt;You are literally contradicting yourself here. Like you said Randle runs the offense, Zion absolutely doesn't, Zion receives the ball and then attacks, that is basically all he does. Which is why Randle has almost twice as many assists as Zion.   You don't watch the Pelicans very often do you? Do you think ""attacking"" and creating aren't running thr offence? Zion doesn't just wait for the ball then take a dribble and shoot? He's not Deandre Jordan   &gt;They win more games than the Pelicans so by that logic is worse.     What? I know they win more games, I'm saying the end of the court that Randle primarily brings value on, his team isn't actually that effective  &gt;Hypotheticals, hypotheticals, hypotheticals.  Yeah, and measurement of team quality. After 10 games do we say the team with the best record is the best team in the league? No, we can look and see that clearly there is a bigger picture to come    &gt;Randle isn't the winner because the Knicks won a handful more games. He is the winner because he is the more complete player who has taken a much worse team to a better record, while playing better in every area besides scoring. Pelicans is stock full of talent. Their entire starting lineup is full of young stars or capable NBA players like Adams, and yet they lose. The second best player on the knicks is an inefficient sophomore guard, the third best player is who? Some rookie? Reggie Bullock?  What has Randle actually taken them to? You're right, they have a deficit of talent, that's part of why they are 25th on offence. But you're giving him a lot of credit for wins that are won by his 4th ranked defence, a defence that's primarily produced by his teammates  There are countless examples of people doing this, giving credit for a defensice teams success to the teams best offensive player. The team looks like it lacks talent because it lacks offensive talent, so it looks like the best offensive player is carrying them, when in fact the other side of the court is doing the heavy liftkn"
"Imagine if the Nets do not win the title this year with Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, etc (assuming they're all playing). It would be an absolute embarrassment.   I'm honestly rooting for them to choke to see the backlash."
Okay DeAndre Jordan definitely needs to stop playing.  The Nets getting off to these terrible starts is mainly on him.  He was a -16 this game. Claxton was +19 and Blake was +23.
This was one of the most predictable 18 point comebacks you’ll ever see.  Also Deandre Jordan is a great tank commander. The only problem is that the Nets are trying to win games
"I mean 7-9 from 3 is 7-9 from 3. That said, playing DeAndre Jordan on Christian Wood probably wasn't doing Brooklyn any favors.  (I actually think DJ is better than his rep this year, but floor spacing 5's are a pretty tough assignment for the old man)"
Because Bruce brown and deandre jordan classify as a superteam
That team was talented but flawed. It's hard to win a chip when 2 out of your 3 best players can't make a shot out of 3 ft. Deandre Jordan was a late game free throw liability. The lane was always clogged for CP3 to operate and they did not have many good 3 point shooters.   Name me a team that won the championship where 2 out of the 3 best players on the team couldn't shoot or make free throws at a consistent clip.
"I feel like it had more potential than we ended up getting  Like if rose and gordon didn't get their careers altered from injuries and players like Beasley,Mayo and Bayless lived up to their potential it would've been one of the best easily  But rn it's just Russ rn carrying that class and the other guys are just really good role players pretty much but some had their time to shine like (Rose, Love, Brook Lopez, DeAndre Jordan,etc)  I'd take classes like 2009,2011 and 2012 overall as classes tbh"
"From a player perspective, if you believe in your ability (and your front office/coach), you can make up for the salary cut in endorsements/sponsorship.  If you are an elite player in your sport, those deals often dwarf your contract anyways. I'm surprised more players in salary capped sports don't ""cheat"" by taking lower salaries. Its a major loophole to salary-capped sports, that very few players take advantage of.  I mean look at the Nets. Harden and KD are each 25% of the salary cap. Kyrie is 20%. That 5% basically accounts for them being able to have DeAndre Jordan (6.23%) or Spencer Dinwiddie (6.87%) on the roster vs. a minimum contract guy (~1%).  Every little bit helps.  Right now Vuch is at 20% and Zach is at 15%. I don't know the exact numbers, but if Zach takes 20% rather than 25%, that is huge for roster construction potential."
"rightfully so, guys like Deandre Jordan had no business on all-nba teams."
"I think you mean 2015, in 2016 Kawhi had 40 1st place votes more than Draymond.   In 2015 Draymond had 8 1st votes more than Leonard and only 35% of the total 1st place votes. If you only count 1st place votes it would have been the 2nd closest vote this century, with the least amount of votes difference between 1st and 3rd.   It was a 3-way split vote between those 2 and Deandre, with several players getting 2nd votes, even AD getting a bunch of 1st. Kawhi was left out from several ballots too, there are some that have neither of them. It was a very open race.  Draymond had similar advanced stats and impact metrics than Kawhi and he didn't have by far the most 1st place votes. He had a great argument for the DPOY for either year, but I don't think that not winning it was him being robbed.  And it's not unheard of either. In the MVP of 1990 Magic won by having an even bigger deficit with Barkley because of the way Jordan split the vote."
He definitely did. He also learned to push guys from behind on rebounds from playing the Clippers and DeAndre Jordan
He makes deandre Jordan sort of playable

"You underrate Shaq too much. It almost feels like we're discussing about an in-form DeAndre Jordan here. As much as game changed, an impossible to defend inside presence is the best you can have. You don't believe teams would have to adjust to Shaq, instead you think they try to make him run around, chasing guards. Not gonna happen. Teams would have to adjust, play one or two big, bruisers while Shaq is on the court, no one's gonna try to defend Shaq with shooting guards or small ball centers, because it's suicide. Embiid or Jokic didn't show anything remotely close to what Shaq showed us and this is not a knock on them. Guy dominated NBA finals over and over and you think Embiid and Jokic have advantages over Shaq. Come on man..."
"So it's a subjective thing and at the end of the day there's no wrong answer. It's all opinions.   Objectively though, the Spurs fostered an environment that found, developed and kept hall of fame level players. Duncan undeniably played a part in that. Not 100% but some share.   The Lakers had a different culture that their best players during that time, Kobe/Shaq then just Kobe, played a part in. Again not 100% on them, but it's not 0%. Both organization had dozens of great players during that time, but only one never missed the playoffs. Furthermore, the Lakers were legit contenders from 2000-2004 and 2008-2010. The Spurs were legitimate contenders from 1998-2015, between 50-63 wins every season. Not saying they didn't get upset on occasion, but they were there. Every year. Every single year there was a chance it would break their way. Not a dynastic approach like the Lakers' runs turned out to be.   Duncan was the most underrated, under publicized superstar of his era and he liked it that way. Kobe played in LA. Look at the fame and attention Kuzma has...that Laker effect is real and Kobe being super marketable feed into that. That would explain all of those all-defensive teams he was put on, and we know how flawed those votes are now. Imagine how ridiculous they were before streaming and voters just looked at simple box scores and names.   Saying Duncan ""just guards the paint"" is way too simplistic and ignorant. Draymond just yells, Giannis just dunks, Steph Curry just shoots threes, Harden just does step backs. Those statements all have the same weight to them.  And finally, Duncan's leg was toast since like maybe 2010. He was dragging that leg around. Was still working prime 2012-2014 Deandre Jordan and Chris Bosh in the post in the playoffs. Still being the leader and go to guy on those team. While still being able to build an environment that allowed him to age gracefully on the court.   I agree with you, that Duncan never carried a bad team. #1 because he never had a bad team and #2 because even at the end of his career, he was still carrying a good team when it mattered most."

"1 all nba 3rd team doesn’t make you great my guy lol.   Guys like Kemba Walker, Oladipo , al Jefferson , deandre Jordan, Dragić etc have all made all nba 3rd team and all star games. I don’t consider them great or elite. They’re good players but that’s about it, same with Ben Simmons.   Again this comes down to how you define great lol."
"I'm going through some mid-late 2010s allstars: deandre jordan, teague, and dragic.   maybe oladipo, middleton, siakam, porzingis could be forgotten in 20 years, but they're still kinda young and could build some memorable careers in the next few years"
DeAndre Jordan?
"He played with Harden, deandre Jordan, Blake griffin,  Crawford and Stojakavic. He's never elevated his play in the postseason and turned it over a bunch at the end of some of those playoff games"
"Beside the obvious fact that Embiid isn't a forward and we really need to switch to 3 frontcourt/2 backcourt players, I feel like Dame's been better than Luka. Also CP3 probably deserves higher since some people have him as an MVP candidate.  Seriously though, just make the teams 3 front, 2 back. This way we don't have seasons where there's literally no amazing Centers and too many forwards or too many dominant Centers. DeAndre Jordan was first team all NBA one year on 12 ppg, 13 rpg and only taking like 6 shots per game. His shooting percentage was nuts, but he was not top 5 in the NBA that season. Especially since KD got 2nd team averaging 28/8/5."
"There’s no way he’s a first teamer, but Deandre Jordan did this in 2016"
Deandre Jordan did it.  And Westbrook's not making 1st team. Has a decent shot at 3rd Team tho
CP3 is the only reason Deandre Jordan was an All-Star. Griffin was legitimately talented but isn't an all-time talent other PG's got to play with.
Michael Jordan Clarkson turned into DeAndre Jordan Clarkson
"Not at all. KAT is supremely skilled, but lacks elite size/length.   Wiseman’s skill set is more similar to DeAndre Jordan than KAT, although he’s more talented on the perimeter than DeAndre."
That wasn’t really why they weren’t evenly matched. It was mostly DeAndre Jordan feasting vs old man Jermaine O’Neal
"We had a decade span where we had 3 all-time terrible FT shooters having large roles in their teams in Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond. All 3 of them were kinda competing for those terrible FT records. I'm pretty sure they've changed the rules so its harder for them to rack up FTs like that, and I don't think we're gonna have any players be as consistently terrible at FTs as them in the future. Pretty safe record tbh."

"&gt; recording historic offensive seasons.  So, kinda like youshould have to do, anyway? To be 1st all nba you gotta have a great season anyway... unless you are Deandre Jordan.   Maybe there'd been a year where a player like Rudy doesn't make it but actually ahving to give it to him by default instead of having people actually arguing for his place gives a worse view of those center qualities... some people look at it like a pity vote instead of the legit case it is"
"He and DeAndre Jordan both improved significantly the same year, almost like they did it just so they wouldn't have sole ownership of the worst free throw shooter in the league title."
"If DeAndre Jordan never gets any minutes, Nets in 4."
Deandre jordan clarkson*
"Having another star and basically minimum players is not stacked. Without all 3 stars their depth is really bad. They have to start guys like DeAndre Jordan who is washed up, minimum player Jeff Green, minimum player Bruce Brown, TLC, Tyler Johnson. Joe Harris is a great spot up shooter but his defense is terrible and can’t do much else. With only 2 Stars the Nets are not stacked at all"
This quote makes perfect sense when you remember that Doc's the guy who compared Deandre Jordan to Bill fuckin Russell.
"The team just wants the ball handler to have the ball for transition, so they have the other players box out so the transition starts with Luka, LeBron, harden, or Westbrook instead of Dwight Powell, Marc gasol, DeAndre Jordan, or Davis bertans  The uncontested rebounds are meaningless and don't add value, but getting the ball to your primary ballhandler as fast as possible does.  Some stans will argue though because they get hype about triple doubles and don't want to hear anything opposing their love of the big statline since it helps their player look better"
&gt; Wow I think Deandre Jordan is even worse than Drummond.  Pretty sure this is common knowledge and has been for a while.
Wow I think Deandre Jordan is even worse than Drummond. He's so useless out there
bro this aint fucking deandre jordan catching lobs this dude is attacking from the top of the key like a guard bullying his way to the hoop and finishing like he’s kyrie
"What do you mean no issue? It’s an all-NBA team, there aren’t going to be issues.   And it seems like the DeAndre Jordan example is a perfect example of how dumb mandating positions is. The all-NBA team should be made up of the best players. If it’s all guards or forwards so be it."
"But in this case, it means that it has been done and there has been no issue. If you are just looking at all NBA to see who had the best season in a given year, you are doing yourself a disservice. No one thought DeAndre Jordan was a top 5 player when he was first team center."
"As previously noted...  One should apply some era adjustment to this efficiency statistic. Interior defense in the NBA is worse than it ever has been, by leaps and bounds.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective FG% in the NBA. All are obviously active players. Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are active."
"&gt;The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen. If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint. Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  You dont really seem to get that Danny Green cant guard Harden and if Thybulle is on the floor their offense is gonna be bad. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry will also have to play big minutes. Its not gonna be like you are thinking at all. Embid is gonna have to sometimes. Also you keep ignoring that they are going to get burned in Drop coverage heavy.  &gt;'m more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers. Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender. If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all. You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster. Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing. The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that. That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5. All bad defensive setups. Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum. If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  Harris has never been known as a good defender in his career ever. He will get roasted by any of the big three...like any of them, same with Seth Curry. I'm basing this on the reality of what they are. Okay so you know nothing about the Nets basically and are talking about things you dont know.  They have not said that. They have been trying to move away from Jordan for awhile. Claxton has been called their best defender by Nash. He's much better on defense than Griffin, you do not know what you are talking about.   They are benching DJ right now for Griffin too and as Claxton ramps up he will get more minutes. They wanted to bench DJ when Aldridge was there too. Which is why Claxton got minutes the very first day Aldridge got there and DJ got a DNP.  Every single metric shows DeAndre as a poor player, they are not gonna play him good minutes in the playoffs. Claxton will get minutes. That is flat out false lol. Nash literally called him their best defender. DJ literally was a DNP last game. They may experiment with BG at the 5 but once Harden comes back its gonna be clear Claxton needs to be the center.  Nic Claxton has also been on Covid protocol for awhile and Nash has been ramping up his minutes as he only got back two games ago.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No, that's not what spacing is. Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping. And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot. If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers. You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule. Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team. Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  Spacing is the result of having good shooters on the floor you cant leave, you arent getting it. The Rockets had no off ball movement at all. All Harden/KD/Kyrie has to do is get by his initial defender and the others already have an advantage. Houston had stationary shooters for years and their offense was great, LOL now those stationary shooters are KD/Kyrie/Shamet/Harris, you do not know what you are talking about.  You are reaching hard.  Younger Gobert? Lol it was 2-3 years ago when Gobert was still a defensive force in the league and it happend 2 years in a row. Embid is not a better defender than Gobert. Harden destroyed them the first two-three games in both series. It took them 2 games to adjust. By then Cp3 could kill them when they ran drop coverage lol, what do you think Kyrie and KD are going to do Embid. And the only reason Harden did poorly in those last couple of games was because they were sitting on his left forcing him right, something that DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. They built their whole offense around stopping Harden, good luck doing that with KD and Kyrie on the team.  The thing is....Philly is actually only marginally better on offense than those Utah teams as well. To boost their offense you would need to play Curry and he's gonna get reamed on defense.   &gt;It's not a lazy take. The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense. We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it. Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game. We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency. This obviously isn't a bad idea, the man is the best pure scorer in the NBA. But Steph/Klay/Dray all had to be selfless in order to integrate Kevin Durant. And Kevin Durant is a hyperefficient scorer whose only goal was to win. Granted he phoned it in the next two years and refused to run our offense, but our stars sacrificed for him. Kyrie and Harden simply are not as selfless as Steph and Klay. Harden and KD both think they are ""the guy"" and there is eventually going to be friction. Just like there was with Shaq and Kobe. Just like there was initially with LBJ and DWade. Steph was our guy and stepped back for KD, and he didn't care who ""the guy"" was. The difference to your current setup is there is a third star with a history of problems in this exact area and locker room drama and this ""big 3"" has only played 2 games together.   &gt;   &gt;You are grasping at straws and I think you are really emotionally invested in Harden getting a championship here. I'm not rooting against them, I personally visually love Kyrie's game and KD is fascinating to watch, and Harden is who the other team has to game plan around. But I just do not see this as a good fit. I see the same perfect storm around each team like last year's Clips who get hype because of the talent before people take the rose colored goggles off and notice their flaws.  Mhmm..narrative nonsense.   You are grasping at straws. You have an idealistic view that off ball-movement based offense is best and only the players who fit that mold will win.   Harden and KD is one of the best fits in the league and Harden and Kyrie literally went like 16-3 together."
I mean he’s a center and isn’t shooting jump shots like the other two? Does deandre Jordan having a higher true shooting than steph effect your opinion of either player?    Nobody is doubting that wiseman can develop into a fine player but it’s fair to assess that he looks significantly worse than the other two players drafted top three. In a redraft he would go significantly lower based on both rookie performance and career potential.
Reminder that deandre jordan made 1st team before
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
"&gt;when Deandre fucking Jordan made All NBA 1st team, no one said shit  , uh"
"&gt;Big men are not getting the same quality shots if the three point line doesn't exist.    That's true, but I'm referring to the shots they got without the arc.  Nowadays, bigs routinely shoot way over 50%.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in effective FG%.  11 of the 20 all-time are currently active bigs.  &gt;You can watch tape of games before the line was introduced  Believe it or not, some of us played basketball before the arc.  We don't need to watch tape.  &gt; and see how cramped the paint was  And bigs still shot better than Curry does, most years.  The median seasonal effective FG% is .478, and most bigs are north of the median most of the time, almost by definition."
"Gave me pre-Harden Nets big 3 vibes: Kyrie, KD, and fucking DeAndre Jordan lmfao"
"&gt;It's not even about Zion, nobody is getting called at the rim anymore  That's questionable.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in effective FG%, in NBA history.  11 of the top 20 all-time are currently-active bigs.  Those guys are not shooting threes, and they are converting their shots at unprecedented rates -- because interior defense is virtually non-existent in today's NBA."
Center were a very weak position during those years. DeAndre Jordan made an all-nba team during that time lmao
"If this change sticks, one day people will be like ""Bill Russell only made 1st team All NBA 2 more times than DeAndre Jordan"""
"ehhhhhhhh gonna hard disagree on that... he didn't really have any range past 5-10ft or so, don't think that would fly as the #1 pick in the modern NBA (and 51% career FT hammers that point home)  I do think he would be an excellent player, a hyper-athletic big with great rebounding and defensive instincts, plus great touch around the rim.  He'd basically be a maxed-out version of DeAndre Jordan with much better finishing."
Westbrook getting all-NBA last year was maybe the most egregiously bad all-NBA nom besides DeAndre Jordan
"Yeah real bum couldn't even make all-nba over MJ, Isiah, Payton, Stockton, drexler. He played 18 season so a career average of 18 puts him at 25k points in his career. Competion is a real thing when it comes to making All-Nba 1st or 2nd teams ask Deandre Jordan."
"Allen Iverson was a phenomenal passer, Kyrie is decent.  KD is actually a much better passer than Kyrie.  I love Kyrie’s iso game and he has the prettiest and most complete layup package ever, but his passing is mostly him getting stuck when help defense comes and trying to dump off to someone.  He doesn’t get a ton of assists and when he does look to get assists he racks up a LOT of turnovers.  Durant, for a guy of his usage, does not turn the ball over a lot and assist numbers actually look significantly better than Kyrie’s given context.  Kyrie was best as LeBron’s sidekick.  An elite iso scorer who could give a great player plays off.  He’d be solid next to Harden if it was just them and a bunch of 3 and D guys, but instead they moved Joe Harris the sniper to the bench and have DAJ/Griffin contributing to the complete lack of spacing.  They’re going to run into a Sixers packed key in the playoffs with Simmons and Thybulle contesting 3’s and blocking passing lanes, and they’re going to struggle epically.  Then the ghost of DeAndre Jordan will get laughably bullied by Embiid."
"&gt;The right guy with the right skill set could abuse these mini centers  It doesn't even require much of a skill set.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in NBA effective FG%.  12 of the top 20 all-time are currently active.  Interior defense in the NBA has disappeared almost entirely."
"They can get to the second round without Harden, but I don't see them getting past the bucks without KD, Harden and Kyrie all available, especially with no center or player who can even pretend to guard Giannis. They don't really have an amazing defense, their whole strategy relies on super power offense on 3 cylinders. 1 cylinder fails, I really just don't see it happening. If they still had Jarett Allen or a better center than Deandre Jordan, maybe."
"Drummond is actually ridiculously gifted physically, its a shame he has the BBIQ of a rock and a crap mentality  He easily has the physical capability to play like prime DeAndre Jordan (rim running, lob-catching etc), his efficiency would fucking skyrocket if he was smarter about the shots he took. Man has no fucking touch whatsoever yet thinks he's fucking Olajuwon"
"He’s still getting more contested boards a game than a player like Deandre Jordan, Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Biyombo, Brook or Robin Lopez, and more even though his contested rebound % is around 25%. He gets more contested rebounds per game and at a higher percentage than Lebron and he is also within 0.2 contested rebounds or less of Anthony Davis, Julius Randle, etc. Really no matter how you slice it he’s a pretty incredible rebounder. Guards can’t do what he does and its not something that should be simply chalked up to “they want to speed up the pace.” That’s true, but you need a special player to be able to get the rebound with that degree of regularity in the first place."
"Since when are impact stats used for All-NBA lol, I think you're overestimating the amount of actual thought/research voters put into these awards.   More importantly, it'd prevent snubs DUE to positional restrictions, like DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond making it in 2016, despite being nowhere near the best of the league.  It'd also help to reflect what positons were truly stacked during a specific time period, like up until recently the death of the big was a very real thing, and the teams would've properly reflected that."
"All the bums on this subreddit talk about TS. Deandre jordan has like the highest all time, no one cares about that. Westbrook has 2 scoring titles and 3 time assist leader while CP3 has no scoring titles and 4 time assist leading. Cmon man"
Honestly yeah I'd think he was prime DeAndre Jordan just based on stats but he's so so much better
"For myself, its difficult to understand how Kyle has only received 1 Allnba and 0 Alldefense selection given the consistent success he's had over the past few seasons. IMO if you took the past 5 years and averaged out each players ranking each season, Lowry would be in the top 15.  But, since we have to define allnba team by postion, you end up with stupid shit like DeAndre Jordan on allnba 1st team in 2016."
Bro what   They single covered him with DeAndre Jordan over these last two games and he took a ton of jumpers. That’s a great sign for Brooklyn. The fact that he managed to hit them by chance doesn’t mean that he’s always gonna dominate them. Last game is far more representative of how things will likely turn out if he keeps chucking jumpers because he’s a trash shooter. He took 6 shots in the restricted area lmao.   Milwaukee stands no chance if Brooklyn’s stars are all healthy.
"Lol, taking a lot of flack here for calling Deandre Jordan “good,” as though that’s high praise. Jeff Green is maybe better but I’ve also watched Jeff Green for long enough to know he can be really not good too. Blake is…pretty old and kind of healthy?   I’ve watched plenty of Nets games but not enough that I’d consider myself an expert. Don’t know a lot about Claxton besides what the stat sheet says. The only reason I called Jordan “good” was because he’s got more size than anyone else on the team and size = rebounds more often than not, which the Nets desperately need for the big 3 to be effective.  Anyway, I ain’t tryna pretend to be able to have an in-depth conversation about the efficacy of the Nets bench any more than you’d probably be able to do about my team. My initial point remains: outside of the Harden/Irving/Durant all staying healthy going into and during the playoffs, the Nets probably don’t make it past the second round, almost definitely don’t win the ECF.  Now folks pls quit blowing up my inbox I ain’t got more to say."
"The fuck? DeAndre Jordan??  You just exposed your lack of knowledge bud. Jeff Green, Claxton, and Blake are easily better."
You don't watch the Nets a lot if you think Deandre Jordan is their great role player.  Nic Claxton is a far better player than DJ for the Nets.
Anytime someone suggests Deandre Jordan is anything other than rancid than you know they dont watch the Nets
They’ve got two good role players in Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan. What they’ve got otherwise is a lot of not-terrible filler that is okay sometimes and really not good other times.
Deandre jordan has a small reputation among people that haven't watched him play
A guy like Deandre Jordan probably singlehandedly tanks them.
"yeah who knows, they fudge the hell out of the numbers &amp; listed heights &amp; weights (always have).  Like KD is listed at 6'10"" and DeAndre Jordan is listed at 6'11"" but KD is for sure taller.  I was referencing &amp; remembering those stories that were published at the time, not like I got out a tape measure &amp; verified PG-13s height myself."
"3 way tie between Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Andre Drummond"
DeAndre Jordan no doubt.
Shocked nobody in here is talking about how awful DeAndre Jordan is.  Although that's probably because everybody already knew.
"You clearly did not watch the game lmao. Deandre Jordan was fucking awful, Blake Griffin was the one who guarded him well"
"Alright dude. Shaq as of now, is the greatest shooter ever. FG% dont lie.  However, Deandre Jordan and Robert Williams are about to surpass him as even better shooters"
Every starter besides Drummond himself has got to be better right? Maybe not DeAndre Jordan but idk
"Not gonna lie, Blake's defense on Giannis was extremely impressive. Deandre Jordan was bbq chicken tho"
"DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond, name a more anemic duo"
I can’t watch deandre Jordan for a single second anymore.
DeAndre Jordan: 13 minutes   Nic Claxton: 5 minutes   Bruce Brown: 0 minutes   just why
Deandre Jordan is so lucky he’s best friends with Durant and Kyrie
DeAndre Jordan is so fucking infuriating
Blame the nets and deandre Jordan when Giannis becomes a 40% three point shooter
My biggest takeaway from watching this game is  just how terrible Deandre Jordan is...
Deandre Jordan is ass
why is deandre jordan
Why is DeAndre Jordan out there?
What is even the point of DeAndre Jordan
I sure as hell hope that ain’t deandre Jordan checking in the game lmao  E: Fuck
"They literally got rid of the young core, they traded away all the players that made the Nets special sans joe Harris. This is basketball gentrification, it wouldn’t sit right with me to see the knicks trade Randle, RJ and Mitch for Kawhi, Dame and Lavine. I’m not saying that would happen anyways but that’s basically what the Nets did, they traded their identity and culture for the business move of having star appeal. KD and Kyrie didn’t choose the Nets because they had Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen, they chose them because they had cap space and were willing to also sign their friend deandre Jordan. They literally fired their head coach, the person who sets the tone for a teams work ethic and culture, to appease KD and Kyrie. This was the gentrification of a grass roots team that beat the odds, just to sell more jerseys to Midwest transplant Brooklyn hipsters."
"Deandre Jordan was for sure an ironman for a few years. I remember they'd always show his game streak on Clippers broadcasts and he was up to \~ 300 games in a row, without missing a single game, at one point if I remember correctly"
DeAndre Jordan only played big minutes for a few years in his prime.  Before that he was always in foul trouble and now he's a 20 minute a game guy.
"I read something where the two most durable players of the last 10 years are Harden and... Get this, DeAndre Jordan lol."
Idk about most reasonable but today someone with a Hawks flair told me Deandre Jordan is an elite player
You know absolutely nothing about basketball if you think 2021 Deandre Jordan is an elite player
Is this real? Is there seriously someone that thinks Deandre Jordan is an elite basketball player in 2021? Have you seen him play? Are you blind?
"“Fair” has never been a thing with All-NBA, it’s kind of why it’s laughable to use it as a tool to compare players.  There’s a reason Deandre Jordan has one, and now Embiid will probably be 2nd team lol.  Guards have been the victim of this basically every year with how many amazing players are at the position today."
"I gotta rant... This is why I stopped playing 2k Mycareer. I always played centers, so when I fouled guys it was often centers. Fouling guys like Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, and Gobert back then should have msde actual sense. It was around a 50/50 shot with them at the line. But for some reason in 2k they would *always* make both or miss the first, robbing me of the potential rebound and transition opportunity. Across years of 2k I could count on one hand the number of times a poor free throw shooter missed on the 2nd shot, I actually tracked it sometimes. Not to mention the obscene number of 90% free throw shooting games as you mentioned from guys like Drummond. That CPU was bullsugar."
"One should apply some era adjustment to this stat.  Interior defense in the NBA is worse than it ever has been, by leaps and bounds.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective FG% in the NBA.  All are obviously active players.  Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are active."
"&gt;mchale would smoke most bigs today with his post moves  Everyone would.  Interior defense doesn't even exist in the NBA anymore.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective field-goal percentage.  Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are currently active.  The biggest challenge McHale -- or anyone else -- would have is getting teammates to pass him the ball, instead of jacking up threes."
He's just french DeAndre Jordan
I still think Rudy can be the next Deandre Jordan.
"Long overdue.  Mavs struggled to build around their superstars.  Dirk's weaknesses were defense, rebounding and playmaking. It took the Mavs too much time to put Kidd and Chandler next to Dirk to cover them.  And the moves that fell through would have been terrible. DeAndre Jordan would have been overpaid and not a superstar, the wheels fell of Deron Williams and Dwight would have probably not gotten along with Carlisle at that point in his career.  There were at least a few other really bad moves, like Parsons and Rondo."
"It absolutely works. Shaq, DeAndre Jordan, now Ben Simmons. Completely deflates an offense. Awful for everyone involved but it's damn effective."
Let's go with All-stars. He's probably the least skilled since Deandre Jordan. Yet he totally deserved those MVPs so it just says how incredibly he is athletically.
DeAndre Jordan gonna start sleeping with his eyes open.
DeAndre Jordan is done with basketball man
"Deandre Jordan watching this game with a notepad and pen writing ""fuckkkk"""
"KD was good defensively all regular season. And Blake is Giannis' primary matchup. He picked it up more comparatively. But he's still Blake. Really they just stopped playing DeAndre Jordan. They're not a very good defense. Especially matchup wise. The Bucks just haven't been on shit.   Playoff defensive rankings just matter way less because their sample is irrelevant and it varies on who they play.   If you wanna disagree that's fine but to me they ain't like the Lakers, Suns, Sixers, or even Clippers defensively. They're a worse defense than the Jazz, Clippers, Suns, Sixers of the teams left."
DeAndre Jordan
He was a phenomenal coach who paid his dues. Ironically one reason he got kicked out was because he benched DeAndre Jordan…turns out it was the right move.
"You could say this about CP3 and any talented big lol  Like CP3 made DeAndre Jordan into all-nba FIRST team..  You're literally starting off with a hall of fame PG and then tossing in a 2-time MVP, yeah they are gonna be good."
Now we get the “to be the best player in the world you have to earn it by being the best player in the world for multiple years” takes.   People put too much emphasis on names. If Deandre Jordan were to drop 45/20 in every game in the playoffs while leading his team to the chip he’s the best player in the world until proven otherwise.
"I'd be careful trying to load up on shooters for an Olympics. The ball is different, the 3 pt line is a little different, shooters can be a bit ubreliable in international competition. Best way to dominate is to just have a tall beefy dude inside like Andre Drummond because most countries can't match up with the rebounding and inside presence he provides. Unlike the NBA, most international teams won't be able to run someone like him off the floor, all he'd have to do is be taller than everyone in the paint and rebound. We've seen guys like Deandre Jordan dominate in the Olympics in years past for this very reason"
Yet for 70% of games even someone like Andre Drummond or Deandre Jordan is more than enough to dominate inside
"Should’ve clarified that but if it was the case I would’ve mentioned deandre Jordan, rondo, boogie, gasol"
"Everyone says this, but I think the reason why no one actually tries it in-game is because FT shooting is generally very psychological and fans going crazy while you're shooting underhand would mess with you even more.  There are some bad or horrific FT shooters who have improved over time (Drummond and DeAndre Jordan both went from like historically 40% to consistent 60% suddenly, and Brandon Ingram was in the 60s for a few years to becoming one of the best FT shooters in the league) so it doesn't have to be as drastic as a brand new shot.  That said, there are also players who seemingly get worse at FTs over time (Westbrook, Bron) or guys who are just constantly erratic and swing back and forth 10% every year (Duncan)."
Why isnt DeAndre Jordan playing? Is he really that bad now? Or injured?
Is DeAndre Jordan injured? Or too trash at this point
We all already know KD is better than DeAndre Jordan
TIL DeAndre Jordan was 1st team All-NBA in 2015-2016. Seems like the Nets could use him right now.
Deandre Jordan 2016 First team All NBA Centre... To DNP CD 2021
I think it's hilarious that the Nets FO has been hamstrung by their DeAndre Jordan contract because KD and Kyrie wanted to play weird their friend.   Saddled themselves with Kendrick Perkins 2.0
DeAndre Jordan still out here with the backwards hi 5 huh
What has happened to Deandre Jordan
"God dammit Steve Nash play Deandre Jordan, Tyler Johnson, and Reggie Perry against this lineup you coward"
"Ah yeah, he made it in 2016-17 (admittedly a weak year for centers, DeAndre Jordan got 3rd team) when the Pels finished 10th"
DeAndre Jordan in 2016 was All-NBA 1st team and All-Defense 1st team without an All-Star appearance. I think his 2017 All-Star appearance was a make-up call for him not being one the year prior.
"Why is DeAndre Jordan running the 2. Bad move offensively and defensively, because of that I'm going team 1 AKA the top team."
Solidifies deandre Jordan as the best Center in the world
DeAndre Jordan stocks 📈📈📈
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
"He's not very good now, but Deandre Jordan used to be awesome in the olympics. He and Melo are some of the only guys that ever seemed to really understand how to adjust to the international rules."
"Nah let’s be fair about this, man  As recently as last season Lopez was a good player  Deandre Jordan has been washed for like three years and has been unplayable against the Bucks all season"
"Wonder how much coaches and managers actually have to say anymore, no sane person would have given Jarret Allen away to keep Deandre Jordan but the Nets were forced to do it out of stardom."
"I think he dunks differently. It’s because of the grip on the ball. He can legitimately windmill it down. So his dunking is really arm / shoulder based.  LeBron, Griffin, Zion Giannis, they’re all body dunkers. Big dudes, flying through the air, and their entire body weight is like a wrecking ball.   Kawhi can seemingly elevate with very little horizontal or angular momentum and then with a single arm just smash someone against the rim.  It reminds me a lot like the way Deandre Jordan dunks."
"Lolol yup I know. Thinking they can get them and actually getting people are teo different things. Still remember the Deandre Jordan saga  But I guess their front office thought they could grab giannis, being European i guess.   Lol anyways it obviously didn’t work. Maybe with a full offseason porzingis can get back to at least what he was doing last year. Because it feels like the Mavericks have wasted picks the last couple of years, while the hawks have hit on a lot of them"
Still DeAndre Jordan on Brandon Knight for me.
And DeAndre Jordan is number 1 all time in FG% lol
One does not simply unleash DeAndre Jordan!
When is the last time you watched DeAndre Jordan play? He is slow and plays no defense
"I wasn't even thinking about blocks, but blocks and steals are prime candidates for empty stats.  Some guys get them as a byproduct of great defense. Sometimes guys chase them and end up hurting the team defense.  DeAndre Jordan was an empty-blocks guy. He was not as good a rim protector as his number of blocks would make you think. Furthermore, he did that emphatic ""swat the ball out of bounds"" thing which actually doesn't help you very much: swat the ball out of bounds, the offense gets it back.   It's not like he was awful or anything, but his 3rd place DPOY and first-team all D were not actual reflections of his impact.   A lot of the best rim protectors (Bogut comes to mind) don't block a ton of shots, but they change everything. And when they do block shots, they keep it in bounds, and they do so without taking themselves out of position (so that if they miss the block they're still in position to rebound, contest the follow-up shot, etc)."
"The second we didnt' re-sign Tyson Chandler and went chasing after DeAndre fucking Jordan, I knew it was over.  At least we got the 'driving around town begging, through texts' meme from that clusterfuck"
I hear DeAndre Jordan is available.
"Nets have a Superstar. 2 All Stars and 4 good role players, including the NBA leader in 3P%.  If you're gonna categorize Jrue as an all star (he was one 6/7 seasons ago. Middleton wasn't an All Star this season either), then Blake, DeAndre Jordan were all stars even more recently.  No excuses for KD. If he's GREATER than Giannis without MVP teammates (Westbrook, Curry), now's the time to prove it."
PG Kevin durant  SG joe Harris  SG Landry Shamet  SG TLC C Jeff green  Second rotation PG Tyler Johnson SG TLC SG Kevin durant  SF Blake griffin C deandre Jordan
Nah we could use DeAndre Jordan if Claxton and Blake foul out lmao.
Clippers: Pg: Chris Paul Sg: JJ Reddick SF: Paul Pierce PF: Blake Griffin C: DeAndre Jordan 6th man: Jamal Crawford
"Our team this year would be pretty insane with a prime Rondo and prime Boogie, but I'll go with 2012-13 Clippers.  PG - CP3/Bledsoe  SG - Billups/Jamal Crawford  SF - Matt Barnes/Grant Hill/Caron Butler  PF - Blake Griffin/Lamar Odom  C - DeAndre Jordan"
I actually think Nash has done a really good job managing egos (deandre Jordan stopped playing a while ago and you don’t hear any grumbling from the stats about it). He’s also got the nets to keep moving  the ball on offense despite their immense isolation talent
"CP made DeAndre Jordan an All-Star. No disrespect to DJ, but CP is what made him special. CP has basically been the most important player on every team he's been on. Great player. I'm actually rooting for the Suns this year because of Paul - hope he gets a ring."
"Hes a better deandre jordan. Thats just his style, not a weakness when you have such a good 3 point shooting team. When Conley is back he will utilize that aleyoop."
"Honestly, I loved those ones with him, Dame, K. Love, and Deandre Jordan as a family."
"How can he prove himself when he has a skeleton team around him? The Nets traded away all their assets for Harden.  Joe Harris is probably their best starter, elite 3pt shooter, not a black hole on defense. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are decent, but average for a starter. Deandre Jordan is just ok, efficient offensively, and catches lobs but he's easily exploited on defense. Everyone else is below average or terrible.  Bruce Brown is actually decent offensively, but as a PG he's pretty shit, can't facilitate worth a damn despite playing significant minutes. Mike James is a much better facilitator as a PG, average 3pt shooter, but absolutely trash in the paint, not a threat running to the rim so defenders just guard him at the key. Claxton is too inexperienced and has no idea what's going on half the time. TLC been trash at the perimeter this season, isn't great on either end of the floor. Shamet is a good volume 3pt shooter, isn't great at the rim, shit defense, a decent player off the bench actually but not starting caliber on any team. Chiozza is like 5'9, can't shoot, gets shit on in the paint, but is a good facilitator.  With KD, Kyrie, and Harden, this is an blowout championship team, with KD and either Kyrie or Harden, this is a legitimate contender. With just KD, this is a play-in team at best lol. Wayyy too top heavy to be able to afford 2 of their 3 stars out."
Nets need to bring out the big gun: DeAndre Jordan
Monkeys paw curls  DeAndre Jordan now starts over Bam
Deandre Jordan can’t even get garbage time minutes
Has DeAndre Jordan become so unplayable that the Nets can't even use him for rebounding?  Can't be too much worse than Claxton who is essentially just getting his cardio in today.
is DeAndre Jordan hurt? Why is Nash not playing him
Deandre Jordan should be in by now since it wouldn't hurt to try him out
At least put in deandre Jordan and Bruce brown instead of taking it in the ass. Holy shit lmao
"Aside from this season where he regressed significantly, DeAndre Jordan improved his free throw percentage by a substantial margin. Career low of 37.5% and peaked at 77.3%"
Why aint Deandre Jordan playing?
"I’d take KD over Giannis too when he has Steph, Klay, Draymond, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Ibaka, Steve Nash, Mike Dantoni, his personal security guard, etc."
If Blake can still dunk (which we know he can do) why don’t Kyrie and or Durant utilize him in a P&amp;R situation like CP3 used to do with him rolling to the basket for a lob threat......   I mean camels made a living off of those plays with Harden and Blake\ Deandre Jordan (especially made a lot of money off those kinda plays)   If Blake can’t dunk any more than obviously those plays wont work   I also know he’s not as “athletic”’as he was back then dunking over mozgov and Perkins but I’d think the play could/ might work?
"Underrated one, but if the Clippers somehow comeback vs the Jazz, they have a good storyline. They'd likely play against CP3 in the conference finals (confronting their old point guard.) Then if they beat the Suns, they'd likely face the Nets who have Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.  The Clippers would be confronting Lob City if they want to win it all."
Deandre Jordan
Deandre Jordan to the Mavs.
You mean when he broke has hand punching a team trainer while at dinner with him and DeAndre Jordan?
"There’s a significant difference between CP and Jimmy in that Jimmy’s vocal about when you’re stepping out of your role, but CP is really great about communicating the limits and specifications of your role before you do too much. And Jimmy’s even said as much (that interview he did on JJ’s podcast gave a lot of insight into this). It’s a difference in leadership style that makes Jimmy a more feast or famine leader than CP.   CP’s worked to get the most out of young guys on his team his whole career. We’ve seen guys under 25 have great showings on his teams. Off the top of my head Eric Bledsoe, DeAndre Jordan, Clint Capela, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, and now DA, Cam Johnson and Bridges all got great starts to their careers by getting guided by CP on how to to fit their games around him because CP is one of the all time great floor conductors. Paul’s just always on time and that consistency is great for young players.  My only concern for a CP/KAT pairing would be if KAT would be reduced to a rim running center I think that’s a waste of his 3 level scoring game."
Relaxing goaltending rules.  Big men would have a field day if you can tip the ball up regardless if it's within the 'cylinder' above the hoop.  I remember Deandre Jordan using it very well in the olympics years ago.
"It also set off [the great emoji war of 2015](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/7/8/8914659/the-clippers-mavericks-battle-for-deandre-jordan-is-all-out-emoji), which was already hilarious but became legendary when Paul Pierce tried to join in but just proved he was too old to use emojis."
As seen by the DeAndre Jordan contract lol
"I don’t think Thanasis is a problem for the league, as he is also a player and his salary is in the cap. I guess it is not incredibly rare for NBA teams to make deals for dudes who are close to superstars. LeBron publicly strong arming Cavs to re-sign Tristan Thompson, Deandre Jordan being close with KD and Kyrie at Nets come to mind instantly."
That time the Clippers kidnapped DeAndre Jordan to make him resign
DeAndre Jordan lol.
The DeAndre Jordan free agency fiasco was an all time great wtf
Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond making all-nba in 2016 just shows you the state of the center position at that time
Deandre Jordan??????????
"The real reason DeAndre Jordan didn't go to Dallas, the CP3D was too good."
Gotta be Deandre Jordan. Even at the time it felt ridiculous.   Also Noah used to be nuts
1st game was an OT thriller though. Playoff atmosphere and fans along with home court could make the difference. Really wanna see Book go Kobe mode in the finals though. I know Ayton will eat on the Nets if that ends up being the matchup. They’ll probably give DeAndre Jordan some run because nobody on Brooklyn can match up.
Oh I read this as Deandre Jordan first and I was like  WTF?!?!
DeAndre Jordan and Jaylen Brown are the realest dudes in the NBA. And honorable mention Jeremy Lin and Steve Kerr.
"""CP3 finally being on the right side of injury luck in the playoffs to help get him to his 1st NBA Finals just to get destroyed by a juggernaut Nets team featuring James Harden, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan &amp; Mike D'Antoni would be so Chris Paul."" - Barry"
"Totally. But if Deandre Jordan runs off the bench across the court and shoves PJ, there are repercussions"
"David West was really good in his prime, and this was 15 years ago when the league was more in tune with his game... plus they had 30-year old Peja Stojakavic shooting .441 on his threes and a 25 year-old Tyson Chandler. That's not a lottery team.  And those Clippers had Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, and JJ Redick when they were in their prime. They were really good!"
Didn’t he have Deandre Jordan before?
So did deanDre Jordan lmao
You know who does a great one believe it or not? Deandre Fucking Jordan.  https://youtu.be/8edRxLqmthI
A free-throw contest between DeAndre Jordan and Giannis for Game 7 would be must-watch TV.
"The reason why we don't is his hands.  If he had the hands of Clipper Deandre Jordan, we could feed it to him so many damn times.   I have been on record, since Game 6 against OKC 3 years ago, that I want Gobert to work on holding on to the ball."
What about forcing them to give Deandre Jordan more playing time as punishment?  Too medieval?
Suspend everyone but DeAndre Jordan
"To the degree he does, yeah. Rudy effectively hasn't taken a shot outside 10 feet in 2 years. He effectively takes 80% of shots within 3 feet of the basket, almost never posts up, mismatch or not.   Even lob city DeAndre Jordan who set league records for FG% didn't take that high a percentage within 3 feet.   For example. The next highest FG% player this season Richaun Homles; 63% FG% to Rudy's 67% FG% takes 40% of shots within 3 feet. 28% outside 3 feet and 25% outside 10 feet. Rudy takes 77% of his shots within 3 feet. 77%! 20% outside 3 feet. And, effectively 0% outside 10.  Rudy does what he does well, but the cult of Rudy is really on a mission to pretend he is not incredibly limited offensively."
"Totally ok to not suspend DeAndre Jordan, though. To show we aren’t unfair."
"Dwight had an offense run through him. Ayton already has a better offensive game than Rudy and does SO MUCH MORE than just layups and dunks. Capela shoots from 3-10 feet and at least attempts mid range shots. Bam shoots mid range and threes.   Congrats, Rudy is better at dunks and layups than Steven Adams and washed up Deandre Jordan. Is that really what you’re proud of?  Also calling Ayton a post up center shows how little you actually know"
"Efficient, defense oriented, small vertical Gobert? Young athletic explosive prime alley-hoop DeAndre Jordan?  Are you blind? Their play styles are completely different."
"cp3, blake griffin and deandre jordan"
I thought that was Deandre Jordan giving the Nets an FU by swapping jerseys and going wild with the crowd.
[Mark Cuban DeAndre Jordan](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3cmmum/broussrard_sources_cuban_is_beside_himself/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
"&gt;""Who knows though, maybe he'll be the next Deandre Jordan.""  &gt;Honestly at this point I don't even remember what the consensus on Deandre Jordan was, so if someone could offer an explanation as to what they meant that would be great.  This is a compliment, hah. DJ was a beast 8 years ago, but idk how anyone was thinking Middleton was even close to the same player as DJ."
"&gt; Honestly at this point I don't even remember what the consensus on Deandre Jordan was, so if someone could offer an explanation as to what they meant that would be great.  DeAndre Jordan was seen as a massive disappointment in college and then turned out to be a very good NBA player. A lot of people weren't sure if he was gonna make it in the NBA at all."
"deandre jordan also went to texas a&amp;m, i think thats why they mentioned him?"
&gt; Deandre Jordan has 3 All NBA selections while Ray Allen has none  Ray Allen has 2 by the way. 2000-2001 and 2004-2005
"What about JR Smith? Game 1 of the 2018 finals?  Edit: Deandre Jordan had a similar incident against the Blazers. He rebounded the ball as the shot clock went off, which he took for the game clock. So he just held the ball as time expired and Chris Paul furiously screamed at him to shoot it lol"
"Lol very similar to your Deandre Jordan example, that argument means nothing. There are 99 other writers that get votes. I’m sorry we aren’t all as smart as *you*.   Okay let’s turn this around, why was he voted as one of the 5 best players in the NBA two seasons in a row? What does 1st team all nba mean to you?  Edit: Luka also entered last season as top 5 in NBA mvp voting odds. What does that mean to you?"
"Damn yeah must be some fluke that Luka was on it two years in a row. Just another Deandre Jordan! Definitely not a top 5 caliber player, thanks for your brilliant insight."
Never forget when Brandon Knight had his ankles snatched from his body by Kyrie in the Rising Stats game and then got his soul taken by DeAndre Jordan in the span of like 2 or 3 weeks
The world was so much better 5 years ago when Deandre Jordan was a top 5 NBA player while also being the third best player on his team.
"His ball handing is actually really good for a dude his size. See Javale McGee and Deandre Jordan for comparison.  What he does with his body on the basketball court requires a lot of coordination, grace, and skill. There’s a reason he can do it while other 7 foot athletic guys can’t.   Harden and Giannis were just engaging in exaggerated shit talk. Saying giannis has no skill has about as much validity as saying Harden doesn’t ever play defense"
"The most athletic 7ft in history, stronger than mr Olympia with great touch around the basket would be DeAndre Jordan lmao  This sub full of 🤡🤡"
Wilt would just be a glorified DeAndre Jordan in today’s game.
Here's a list of all stars that were drafted by small market teams in the past 20 years (MVPs in bold):  * Zion * Donovan Mitchell * Bam * Sabonis * KAT * LaVine * **Jokic** * Oladipo * **Giannis** * Gobert * AD * Lillard * Drummond * Middleton * Kyrie * Kemba * Vucevic * Kawhi * Isaiah Thomas * Cousins * Hawyward * PG * **Harden** * Tyreke Evans * **WB** * Love * Hibbert * Lopez * Dragic * **Durant** * Conley * Roy * Rondo * Lowry * Millsap * Bogut * Deron * CP3 * Granger * Dwight * Emeka Okafor * Deng * Jameer Nelson * **Lebron** * Melo * Wade * David West * Mo Williams * Kyle Korver * Amare * Caron Butler * Boozer  Here are those drafted by big markets (top 10: https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/)  * Trae * Tatum * Ben Simmons * Ingram * Jaylen Brown * Porzingis * D'Angelo Russell * Embiid * Randle * Siakam (I think Toronto is a pretty damn big market) * Beal * Dray * Klay * Butler * Wall * Griffin * **Steph** * DeRozan * Jrue Holiday * Jeff Teague * Rose * DeAndre Jordan * Horford * Noah * Gasol * Aldridge * Bynum * Lee * Devin Harris * Iguodala * Al Jefferson * Bosh * Kaman * Josh Howard * Yao Ming  **A lot more all stars and a lot more superstars were drafted by small market teams.**
its spelled Deandre. Jordan is spelled DeAndre. Hunter is spelled De'Andre. Bembry is spelled DeAndre'. Learn.
"I guess he's now DeAndre Ayton-Jordan,"
He obviously meant DeAndre Jordan
"Nobody calls them that, this is like when people in the Mavs reffered to Deandre Jordan as DAJ."
"Pretty sure Dwight was generously listed at 6'10"". Think he was closer to 6' 8-9"" but he had a ridiculous wing span. There was a picture of him on Team USA looking a lot closer to Bron and KLove than DeAndre Jordan IIRC."
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14.

"He was an even worse GM during his time on the Clippers. He’s a big factor in CP, Blake Griffin &amp; DeAndre Jordan not winning a ring."
Deandre Jordan is an all-star caliber center and was a key piece in the Nets winning games without kd for 3 months. The 27th pick could also be a future all-star. If I were the 76ers I would take Jordan and the 27th pick for Simmons all day and as an unbiased fan it's an even trade.
DeAndre Jordan
"Wood, Allen, John Collins if he counts as a big man, Deandre Jordan, just off my head to be honest.  &amp;#x200B;  also apologies for jumping right out the gate"
DeAndre Jordan
"Yeah, it’s why the choice of Kevin Love was so baffling.  Dwight in 2008 and DeAndre Jordan in 2016 played that role perfectly, but with Anthony Davis not available they suddenly acted like there was no one left for that role."
"Likewise with Klay being an elite defender and literally a former DPOY on the roster, don’t forget the Nets coped well enough throughout the regular season on D with Deandre Jordan as their starting center, as well a whole circus of other bottom tier wings coming into the rotation, assuming Dame does go then of course it’s a team that could be vulnerable on defence but it’s silly to assume it’s not automatically one of the strongest teams in the entire NBA"
It's why DeAndre Jordan was so valuable. He could just park his ass in the paint and knock balls off the rim
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
The Warriors would be lucky if Wiseman was able to be Clippers DeAndre Jordan.
"they can start with not using Draymond as the ""mismatch"" PnR guy ever again, with his fucking Ichiro-esque line drives directly at the rim.   Developing Wiseman properly will be deeper than just asking him to basically be DeAndre Jordan on those Lob City teams. During those meaningless regular season games, he needs to be treated like he's prime Shaq by his coaching staff and get him those reps that he desperately needs at this point"
Honestly even Dwight or DeAndre Jordan at this point. Just big bodies that are familiar with USA basketball.
LMAO my dude I would rather trot out Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in a wheelchair than see Deandre Jordan take the floor for the Olympics again.
"I don’t care who it is. Get Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, or Plumdog Millionaire again. Just go get somebody tall who’s job is to play defense and get boards."
"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot—and Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee’s impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven’t won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship résumés, seeing all these new faces on the league’s biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul—these Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we’re getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography—elevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it’s a “down” year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he’s not among the NBA’s peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he’s only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he’s playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis’s signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday’s game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it’s astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis’s blunt power—these stars may be dissimilar, but that’s why they’re such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it’s tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee’s, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on “Booker game” everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points—though playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee’s Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they’re now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn’t see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There’s no asterisk to this title. There’s been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I’d take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the “bubble tournament” in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the “bubble title,” or this one. Come on. Don’t be absurd.   I have no idea what’s going to happen here, and that’s great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday—thanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I’ll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim—it’s hard to get a read on where it’s going. Phoenix’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don’t, and that’s the exciting thing. There’s nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there’s none here. We truly don’t know for sure who’s going to win it, and that’s the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He’s really something else."
"Once in a lifetime player, sure. But by reducing the penalty for getting 6+ fouls you're making that tactic more feasible and it'd get pulled out more often. We already saw them do it for Ben Simmons against Atlanta, even Deandre Jordan got the hack treatment."
Forget their health. Their coaching tactics suck too. Deandre Jordan just chilled on the bench while Brook Lopez and Giannis feasted in the paint.

How honest are players about their regression? Does DeAndre Jordan think he's the same player from the Clippers 5 years ago or does he accept that his body limits what he used to be able to do?
• Lakers give up 22 + Schroeder (S&amp;T) for Dinwiddie (S&amp;T)  • Nets give up 27 + Dinwiddie (S&amp;T) + Deandre Jordan for Schroeder (S&amp;T)  • Kings give up Bagley for Deandre Jordan + 22 + 27
Yeah it’s pretty silly to think “imagine Wilt with today’s science and training” but then also not think that there has been an athlete even 90% as good as Wilt who would be meeting his records with the advancements in science. Like DeAndre Jordan can’t meet Wilt’s absurd vertical records even with 60+ years of athletic and scientific advances? But Wilt would be even better today? It just doesn’t add up. People love to romanticize the past.
"I'd take Ibaka's career over DeAndre Jordan any day. DJ was never that good when he wasn't catching lobs from CP3, and wasn't even a great defender besides shot blocking, which Ibaka was better at anyway. Only reason he was all NBA was because of how weak center was at the time. Easily the weakest all NBA first team pick I can remember. And 24 isn't that far ahead imo  Goran Dragic was the biggest steal from that draft, and it's not that close."
"It's by position which is how normal All-NBA teams do it, like how in 2016, DeAndre Jordan was All-NBA 1st team while James Harden wasn't even 3rd team"
Is DeAndre Jordan related to Michael Jordan?
"Not much! Adam Silver has threatened to enforce a culture of compliance, but what is he really gonna do: Like, take away LeBron's phone so he can't text Kyle Lowry? Hack into Dame's IG DMs?       I kinda think the best solution might be straight-up transparency. This could stop teams like the Knicks (I'm a long-suffering Knicks fan, by the way) from desperately setting up a video chat with Kevin Durant's dad to try to lure him to Broadway... even though, by many indications, KD had ALREADY made up his mind to go to Brooklyn... while he was playing in the Finals for the Warriors. And tampering transparency might stop players like KD, Kyrie and DeAndre Jordan from making up white lies about 4 a.m. phone calls on the night of free agency, when they'd clearly been talking about teaming up for months, if not years… even while Kyrie was still on the Cavs!"
What actually happened with Kenny Atkinson?   Was it really the DeAndre Jordan benching that lost him the locker room?
The quality players you should trade for siakam is Powell Tristan and deAndre Jordan
"The Kidd comparison is utterly asinine. Kidd wasn’t a good shooter his first year in the league but he wasn’t a complete non-shooter. Rookies often struggle with their percentages. He was an OK FT shooter and a pretty bad 3 point shooter (in a time when 3 pointers weren’t as emphasized as now), but he at least took threes and midrange jumpers, and quickly improved to a reasonable shooter within his first couple years in the league (and continued to improve his shooting throughout his career). Ben Simmons by contrast has shown zero ability to shoot from any range (including the line) his entire career, including pre-NBA. He is Shaq level as a shooter, not even on the same planet as rookie Jason Kidd (or Gary Payton). Shaq never developed a jumper or got good at free throws and I don’t see any reason to believe that Simmons will. I could see him becoming a 70% FT shooter if he works hard (DeAndre Jordan and Drummond were able to improve their FT shooting a lot) and a 25% 3 point shooter, but expecting anything more than that would be pretty unprecedented, guys who never shoot don’t just become snipers."
"Nothing strange about it. Simmons had a great year and a lot of sportswriters thought he was one of the 6 best guards in a league that is absolutely stacked with great guards.  Regarding DeAndre Jordan, the rules say you gotta have a center on the first team. It was an underwhelming year for centers and a pretty good year from DeAndre Jordan was enough to get him on the first team with 4 other dudes who were obviously way better than him.  You seem to be under the impression that they based the 2020 All-NBA awards off the 2021 playoffs. I can't believe I have to point this out to you, but those voters don't have time-traveling abilities."
"Deandre Jordan has also made an All-NBA **FIRST** team, what are your thoughts on that?"
I remember in 2016 DeAndre Jordan was basically playing volleyball at the rim doing this. Once I got used to it it actually became a ton of fun to watch the fight for rebounds.
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
Deandre Jordan took full advantage lol dude was batting shit off the rim every few possessions
Kinda nuts DeAndre Jordan has made 3 All NBA teams but has only been an All-star once. He must have some crazy 2nd halves of seasons
"Bro, the world has changed a lot... Basketball is a universally globally popular sport, maybe still nowhere near the impact as Soccer. But there's a lot of talent in the world now.  Serbia/France are actually really good ass teams now. Why do you think only Spain/France used to only give us problems back then? People are acting like Nigeria is a bunch of scrubs, but all of them have played together for years, and several of them are ex or NBA players. And DeAndre Jordan abused the fuck out of that goal-tending rule.  You can't just throw talent all on one team and make it work the next day. That's how Team USA 1996 lost to the 1st scrimmage game against the college guys."
Because they don't care to learn or adjust to new rules. Deandre Jordan did it a lot when he played for the olympic team.
"I know everyone's talked about the foul baiting but this part:  &gt; And Team USA has yet to attempt knocking the ball off the rim after it’s clanking around, a method that’s allowed in FIBA play and what is ruled a goaltend in the NBA.  They really gotta take advantage of this more. Deandre Jordan used this so much and became so good at this during his Team USA runs."
"2016 had guys like butler, barnes, george, and deandre jordan. You need athletic bodies to be role players and the current squad doesn't quite have that"
"Phoenix chose to put Crowder on giannis.  They had bigs, but giannis put ayton in foul trouble and Kaminsky is too slow. Atl had capela, the Nets had DeAndre Jordan.  The perception that the league has no bigs is false. None of them can match up with giannis."
"Suns big 3, mainly because I feel much much better about Ayton than DeAndre Jordan in playoff games.   I'm surprised by how many people in this thread are underrating the Clippers supporting cast during the Lob City era. Jamal Crawford won two 6MOY awards with the Clippers, and Redick averaged 16 ppg on 44% from three as a Clipper. They also had good contributions from Barnens, Mbah a Moute, Rivers, Collison, etc. during the Lob City run."
"DeAndre Jordan 15-16/16-17 season. Averaged 12.7 ppg, 13.8 rpg, 1.2 apg on 43% ft both seasons. He was an all-star the second season but not the first"
"Yup, the defense led to lots of blowouts, and the occasional nail biter when the other team didn’t turn it over and the USA offense stagnated.  It’s why Kyrie, Cousins and Carmelo lost playing time in 2016 to Lowry, Paul George and DeAndre Jordan.    Holiday and Middleton will help, but this team better get real serious on defense real quick.    Also, why did we bring LaVine and Booker to a team that already had Lillard and Beal in the backcourt?  We just wanted to quadruple down on iso scorers with suspect defense?"
"Our guys have played together for 15 years (outside of Thybulle) and have been running the same plays since Beijing 2008. This is the first time most of Team USA has played together. The talent gap is no longer big enough that you can walk away win an automatic win now.   Also the US not picking a proper rim running big outside of maybe Bam but thats not really his playstyle is just strange. Think like Deandre Jordan, Tyson Chandler even Faried. Thos guys dominate because they're so athletic"
"CP3 wanted the ball as a game ball but deandre Jordan wanted the ball for himself, even though he had an average game. To this day, no one knows why he was being a dick and trying to keep the ball."
Noted volume scorer DeAndre Jordan.
"Exactly. I was spoiled because I watched almost all of his career. It was easy to take him for granted. He would hit his shots, get boards, blocks, and make the correct passes, but you wouldn't really notice it. I was in high school and I was talking to another spurs fan and we got on the topic of seeing Timmy's stat line at the end of the game, and being surprised. Surprised, mainly, because there wasn't a single moment that stood out. Of course as I watched more bball, and started to appreciate Tim more and more the more I took notice of it.  Later once I started to notice other big men I noticed how rare he was as a player. My favorite memories of Duncan were actually his later years. I want to say 2012 when the Spurs played the clips Timmy faced a young DeAndre Jordan. Old man Timmy absolutely sauced Jordan. It was a beautiful sight. Jordan was still young and unseasoned, and Tim took complete advantage."
"DeAndre Jordan is .832% career  This proves nothing about Giannis except that he's 7 feet, can run and just dunk.  And that takes no skill at all.  Does Giannis even know how to play basketball or have skill?"
Is DeAndre Jordan a better finisher than Steph Kyrie Dame or prime IT Celtics?

"It sounds like your projecting onto Giannis a narrative that *you* want to exist. The truth of the matter is: you don't know what Giannis was saying. I know what clip your talking about and its not possible to be clear that he was ""pouting.""  I agree with your point about the Bucks needing to find the three ball. I'd argue that their Game 3 performance was indicative of an upward trend, especially with Jrue and Khris getting more involved. But you're kidding yourself if you think Giannis has nothing to do with that. He started the game with like five assists in the first quarter to get his teammates involved.  Also, your comment said nothing of Deandre Ayton's impact. If Ayton is in foul trouble, I'm dumping it to Giannis EVERYTIME. Ayton is the only player (maybe aside from Crowder) that can impact Giannis in anyway defensively. I don't expect the Suns to be this down bad in Game 4, but I also don't expect the bucks to get comfortable now either. They've come back from 0-2 before.  Your comment also implies that the Suns had a poor shooting performance based on their own inability to hit shots, but that's not true. The Bucks were taking away the three ball as an option. Booker was taking terrible shots and couldn't get into a rhythm. Paul was not as bad, but he seemed like a non-factor for most of the game. Both of these players were impacted because Jrue Holiday woke up defensively and the bucks never put themselves in a position to have Lopez on either of them.  This last paragraph is gonna be ranty, but what is ""The Man?"" What is that concept and why does it exist in sports. Being ""The Man"" is a completely relative concept that depends on *your* style of leadership. You could be a psychopath like Jordan or Kobe, or you could be more reserved and team first like Russel or Duncan. There are many different ways to win in basketball, and I'm sure that Giannis will figure out his way of doing so. I'm sure he's not worried about some random redditor's concept of leadership dictating how he's going to communicate to his teammates.  Edit: A word"
"Giannis with Kyrie for 4 games and Harden for 3 games, with the NBA's 3P% leader (Joe Harris), plus Blake Griffin will f**k the league.  With Giannis, even DeAndre Jordan becomes playable, cos DJ just have to guard the paint, while Giannis scours the help defense."
im just imagining that clip of CP3 yelling at deandre jordan to shoot the ball except 10 times angrier
I haven't seen a murder on the court like that since deandre Jordan killed Brandon knight.

"There was that discussion about Cousins, but he was competing against Deandre Jordan, Roy Hibbert, and Marc Gasol exiting his prime  At the time he still definitely wasn't considered a super star"
DeAndre Jordan was never DPOY
Is DeAndre Jordan a superstar?
Exactly how I feel about CP3 and Ayton. Cp3 flops a lot and I hate it but he’s the best Clipper ever. And Ayton is what deandre Jordan wishes he was.
I hope he turns it around but damn he’s not looking like he’s worth that roster slot. Dude looked like Deandre Jordan out there
"The advanced stats on Jordan that season were incredible, he was having a monster defensive season while also having basically the most efficient offensive season of all time.  That season virtually everyone agreed that the two players that you had to guard the closest were Steph Curry and DeAndre Jordan, because if you gave him a inch of space, he’d immediately have the ball lobbed to him and he’d dunk it over your head.  He was such a great lob threat he was actively neutralizing every rim protector in the league, because if Chris Paul was driving down the lane, a uncontested layup by him was better statistically that a contested Jordan Lob."
CP3 missed a ton of games over the course of his time with the Clippers and DJ's stats without him are roughly as good as they are when he played with him.  For some reason people just hate admitting that DeAndre Jordan was pretty damn good at basketball.
I was thinking of this earlier except about Deandre Jordan making first team all nba over Demarcus Cousins
"&gt; KAT was so far and away better than DeAndre Jordan that an exception should've been made for that.  He wasn't though. Defense matters. Jordan was a dominant defender.  KAT still sucks on D, and he was worse early.  Towns is rarely on all league teams because he is a waste on D.  Jordan averaged about 7 shot attempts a game that year, with a lot of those being put back attempts. If they gave him a normal amount of offensive looks, he would have put up 20 a game easy."
"DeAndre was one of those guys who there was always going to be a big disconnect between fans and people in the NBA. This [was before that season look who got voted the best C in the NBA by people inside the league](https://www.nba.com/gmsurvey/2016). AD split hte vote at the 4/5 that's why DJ finished no 1 but point stands. You can look at alot of the impact metrics also DeAndre was top 25 in PIPM for the last decade. I remember there was a stretch for years where Utah could never beat LAC in the reg season and someone once asked Quin Snyder in a presser about how Utah could never score vs LAC and the first thing Snyder said was ""DeAndre Jordan knows all the plays Im going to run and is ready for them before I call them"".    This is the type of stuff that drives that disconnect between leagues perception vs fans and on here. Fans just see missed free throws a guy who can only really dunk and that's the extent of their evaluation."
Michael Jordan shot 6.8 ft per game over his career by your logic deandre jordan is better lol
Robert Williams I think will have a DeAndre Jordan break out season if he can get some consistent run and stay healthy.
Agreed. They did a picture of what Wilt would look like next to DeAndre Jordan based on both of them palming a ball.  Wilt would destroy today's centers.   https://twitter.com/wiltcarchive/status/667790034184118273

deandre jordan? that you?
Right? Cp got Deandre Jordan in all nba imagine Dwight
You think 2016 all nba1 deandre Jordan beats out gobert for 3rd team if his season was magically transported to 2021?
I mean deandre Jordan also played his entire prime with cp3 tho
I doubt it. So much of what makes CP3 great is what he did with Lob City. Ayton wouldn't be this good with those Blake and DeAndre Jordan Backdoor cuts off ball.
Idk when star talent was down and rn is the most star power of all time but the centers were really lacking from like 2012-2016 like guys like deandre jordan were making all nba 1st team and andre drummond was undoubtedly a top 5 center
As soon as Chris Paul leaves Ayton is DeAndre Jordan
"I hate that the names match up, but DeAndre Ayton reminds me of LAC DeAndre Jordan with his smooth, athletic movements, however he is not a liability from the free throw line and has a more rounded offensive game from the post/mid-range. Excited to see how he continues to progress throughout the years and if he can add a consistent 3 ball. If so, we might have another Embiid 🤧"

Greatest Alley oop of all time next to DeAndre Jordan on BK
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
"They did suck, but having watched those teams, they weren't just bad, they were maddeningly bad.  We had Byron Scott who had been regarded as a pretty good coach.  He coached the Nets to the Finals in the early 2000's, coached CP3 on the Hornets to some really good years, was on the Cavs when Lebron was in Miami, and then came back to LA to lead an aging Kobe and Pau with random pieces.  He was the Tank Commander for a reason, his schemes and rotations made little sense for a coach who wasn't some newbie like Luke Walton was.  For someone who had success, it is more likely he sucked on purpose rather than on accident given the disparity in effort, though of course there's no way to prove that.  However, we won 27 games during those years bottoming out at 17, we didn't just suck, we historically sucked.  Its hard to say that even with bad players, we couldn't have swung a trade or gotten a free agent to make us at least competitive.    And Kobe being on the team proves my point.  He was our one star for years, it would have been disrespectful to not try to at least let him end his career with some dignity instead of 17 win shit team.  We gave him $50m for essentially sitting out, just because people still cared about him.  It would have taken almost no effort to pair him up with some more vets and tried to do something (like Jim Buss tried to do with Deng and Mozgov), but instead that was the last gasp of a guy being forced out of his team.  We barely tried because we didn't want to.  And another thing that proves my point: the Lakers' salary during the tank years.  You can say Byron sucked and our players sucked, but you cannot say our Front Office kept trying to put together a winning product.  [In 2012-2013](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/los_angeles_lakers/2012-2013/), we had the highest salary in the league at $100m.  When we started tanking the next year, we dropped only to #4 in the league but shaved off $25m.  The next year we dropped to #9 in the league, and the following year in 2015-2016 we dropped to #19.  This is not the salary of a team who's trying.  The next 3 years we were #19, #21, and #27 in league salary.  Why didn't we sign more Mozgov's and Deng's if we wanted to win?  There are plenty of vets we could throw a big contract to if we really wanted to go for it every year.  We could have at least maintained a top #10 ranking in salary if we wanted to compete, the Lakers' name plus the money would have gotten free agents to join, right?    The salary, more than anything, should be proof we didn't try.  We could give anyone money, who would turn down a fat check from the Lakers?  At the time Carmelo was bouncing around the league and Kobe was gone, we could have said to him ""Hey, here's $25m, come start for the Lakers and be the face of the franchise for a few years"".  Other than Melo, there were plenty of guys past their prime or guys good enough to make a team competitive that we could have thrown money at during the lean years.  Guys like Horford, Whiteside, Dion Waiters, Pau, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward, Millsap, JJ Redick, Gallinari, Taj Gibson, Olynyk, Rudy Gay, Aaron Gordon, Zach Lavine, Derrick Favors, DeAndre Jordan, etc.  I'm sure not all of them would have come, and some of them were never going to leave their team, but if the Lakers came calling with a blank check, I've no doubt we could have gotten a few of those guys as our starters.  Other people who derisively talk about the Lakers brand would have to admit that in this case, it would support the argument that the Lakers didn't get them because they didn't try, not because they couldn't, which is evidence enough for me that we were taking on purpose and not on accident.  And yes, thank you for this discussion, its rare people can disagree without insults.  Kinda nice! 😁"
"Blake, meet your second option: The Nard Dog, sharpshooter for hire with the slickest pump fake in the game. Move over Korver. Move over Reddick. Move over even JOE INGLES. There’s a new white shooter in town and his name is Luke Douglas Kennard, 6’5 and 206 pounds. Watch him post up Deandre Jordan for the one handed slam and the stank face. Watch him date the daughter from Chrisley Knows Best. In 20 years Luke is going to be the second athlete to build a school like LBJ did in Akron. Nard University. Detroit will rebound on a dime as students pour in from across the world. Donovan Mitchell’s pitiful career will pale in comparison, and SVG’s true drafting prowess will be fully revealed."
Deandre Jordan has more first team all Nba selections than Paul Pierce

That makes the lebron and jr moment the Chris Paul and Deandre Jordan moment recreated..
"Even crazier to me was how often the Spurs relied on him repeatedly in the low post in the 2015 playoffs against the Clippers younger and spryer big men. At age 39 playing against DeAndre Jordan, Big Baby Davis, and Blake Griffin, Tim was the Spurs best offensive weapon in that series. Averaged 19-11 on 60% FG shooting."

He's still friends with DeAndre Jordan.

No because that's texting and driving. His driver drove while Cuban texted DeAndre Jordan in the backseat.
Al Jefferson - post moves   Matisse Thybulle - blocking jump shots from behind   DeAndre Jordan - catching lobs   Manute Bol - blocking shots without jumping   Tristan Thompson - offensive rebounding
I don't know. DeAndre Jordan and a couple of late 2nd rounders which combined 20 minutes of NBA experience could do the trick
You mean Mark Cuban didn't drive around Dallas texting DeAndre Jordan?
Peak Draymond was go to 1-5 defender. He didn’t have to guard Jokic or Embiid now though. Who was the best offensive center he had to guard on the regular from 2015-2018? Davis? Cousins? Gasol? Embiid (again)? Fucking Deandre Jordan?
"Just get a team with five centers/big guys that can't dribble or pass and you complete this challenge. Udonis Haslem, Cristiano Felicio, DeAndre Jordan, DJ Wilson and my guy Andre Drummond can definitely go 1-81."
DeAndre Jordan - Vertical Spacing
"Yeah a Vogel defense with LeBron and Davis is half assed, you were probably saying the same garbage in 2020. They are relying on AD and LeBron to produce lmao, this is like me saying that the Nets rely on Tyler Johnson and DeAndre Jordan to produce just lol."
My strategy would be to have a team of only lumbering centres. They will lose almost every game but there’s gonna be one night where a team doesn’t have the big bodies it needs and just gets beat up enough to lose.  PG: Mason Plumlee SG: Alex Len SF: Boogie PF: Robin Lopez C: DeAndre Jordan
"Best way is to throw a bunch of bad/washed centers who can't dribble or shoot together:   Baynes, Kostas, Damian Jones, Deandre Jordan, Felicio  You can full court press this team successfully. In the halfcourt they have zero spacing, it's just going to be them trying to drive in a straight line and fumbling the ball half the time. They'd probably have 40 turnovers in the game. Can't post up smaller players because defense can easily help off of ""shooters"" to double and all these guys have shit passing ability. Total disaster.  And then on D, there's nobody with the lateral quickness to defend off the dribble. The other teams' guards will get into the lane over and over and over."
He's on a nice poster with DeAndre Jordan.  Maybe he can sell an NFT of that.
"Who was the last free agent Dallas got? Remember Mark Cuban driving around trying to DeAndre Jordan signed? I think I may be wrong in that they are a big media market but they still don't get a consistent pull of free agents. I Mena the Knicks didn't get the recent FA crop but Brooklyn did, so I think it's still relevant. I don't mean to argue 100% one way but I do feel there is merit to what I say"
not DeAndre Jordan
If he blocks Deandre Jordan dunk then give him a run.
Didnt this guy get killed by a DeAndre Jordan lob some years ago?
"&gt; Better efficiency doesn’t necessarily mean better scorer.  I never said it was the sole factor. We're talking about efficiency among high volume scorers, we're not bringing up lob getters like DeAndre Jordan for his high TS% in this discussion.   &gt; Jordan certainty didn’t need another elite scorer to come save his team.  Jordan didn't play with a superstar but he played with a 10x all defensive 7x all star 20+ PPG swiss army knife in Pippen, 4x all defensive 1x all star Horace Grant, BJ Armstrong (both Grant and Armstrong were all stars in 1994 when MJ took a break, so that's almost two other all stars), DPOY Rodman, and some of the best international players in Kukoc and Longley. Also benefited from Phil Jackson's triangle offense (technically not his, but he revived the idea) which was the best system taking advantage of illegal defense rules to open up higher quality shots. It's not a coincidence MJ started winning in 1989 onwards when his stats were either the same or worse as his previous years and it wasn't just because of Pippen getting better.  The year MJ took a break they won 55 games, as opposed to 57 they had with the previous season."
"I can see him as a solid starter, almost like a DeAndre Jordan type, if things go his way  RemindMe! 4 years"
"Yea, I’ve also never seen anyone claim they should get more Gobert post ups. He is a dominant defender and great PR guy. Nobody expects Gobert to post. Can you imagine him getting doubled on the block? His head would explode. That doesn’t mean I don’t love him for what he does. Him, Capela, Deandre Jordan just have very specific jobs/roles and post play is not at all one of them."
"I'm guessing that once past the 8 man rotation, the other backup players are easily replaceable as there are many others with equal talent.  Is there a big difference between having Deandre Jordan or Kostas Akumpo as your 3rd big?"
lol im just trying to imagine deandre jordan and andre drummond on the court at the same time
"For the fun of it, I tried to make the worst reasonable super team under that definition, 2016: Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond"
"I don't think anyone's taken his reporting seriously since the DeAndre Jordan nonsense.  When your inaccurate reporting is not only proven false, but also [becomes a meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3cmmum/broussrard_sources_cuban_is_beside_himself/), no network will want you to be the face of their breaking news ever again."
Deandre Jordan
"Contenders that have $9+ million in bad salaries:  **Clippers**  Luke Kennard - $12,727,273	  **Nuggets**  Will Barton - $15,625,000	  **Nets**  DeAndre Jordan - $9,881,598  **Lakers**  Talen Horton Tucker - $9,500,000	  **Celtics**  Josh Richardson - $11,615,328	 Al Horford - $27,000,000	  **Blazers**  Derrick Jones Jr - $9,720,900	  **Hawks**  Gallinari - $20,475,000	  Bogdan Bogdanovic - $18,000,000	  **Pacers**  Myles Turner - $18,000,000	  TJ Warren - $12,940,000	  Jeremy Lamb - $12,940,000	  **Suns**  Jae Crowder - $9,720,900  **Bulls**  Lauri Markkanen - $9,026,952"
Ehhh its close but yes I would take KAT and Ant over the two best Nets players (DeAndre Jordan and Nicolas Claxton ofc)
Oh I guess Deandre Jordan was a top 5 player when he made all nba first team then.  And Big Ben Wallace was a top 10 player since he made all nba second team that year that's how it works right ? Just say yes to the Big Ben part and I can run with finally a non Piston fan saying Ben was top 10
"but what about Joe Harris who they are paying almost 20 million, and Deandre Jordan who they are paying over 10 million"
"Willie Cauley-Stein.  I thought he was going to be a better version of DeAndre Jordan.  Instead, he was a worse Javale MacGee"
Deandre Jordan
He can do Deandre things but he’s also an incredible passer and a way better shooter than Jordan was. Very unique player.
"He was like Prime Clippers Deandre Jordan level defense and rebounding, but quicker, MORE athletic, and a better scorer. (Though not an elite offensive post player). Magic Dwight was the quintessential, lab created PERFECT modern center."
"Mitchell Robinson, dudes gonna be great just watch if deandre jordan made an all nba team to Robinson will make 3 at least"
"i think he genuinely can become the ""DeAndre Jordan"" of this decade. just hope his health is consistently fine for once and he becomes smarter with some vet (Big Al) presence (bites on too many pump fakes / all kinds of fakes)"
When he was locked in defensively he was great on that end. Offensively though he was basically just deandre Jordan
Clippers would be interesting:  • Donald sterling scandal •historical losers •Lob city •DeAndre Jordan FA saga •Exciting early 2000 teams
"I’m still a Brandon Knight fan.  Dude was big for his position back then, and a solid player.  Just never got to the superstar level I thought he would.  Shame that his career is summed up by the DeAndre Jordan stank face"
"Gotta love how you don't say anything of substance and just repeated the same thing you originally commented, just in more words while also basically ignoring everything I laid out.   Here's a specific excerpt on his Lob City days per Kevin Arnovitz at ESPN:  &gt; After Paul exited for Houston, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer reached out to his former point guard. As a relatively new owner, Ballmer wanted to learn from his organization's mistakes and invited Paul to share his thoughts about the current state of the franchise and, more pointedly, his reasons for leaving. When the two met over breakfast, league sources say, Paul stated that Rivers was one of the contributing factors  &gt; The Clippers teams with a core of Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan had a reputation for locker room drama and for perhaps not liking one another.  &gt; But multiple people from the organization indicated to Arnovitz that ""Rivers became as prominent a character in the workplace drama as Paul or Griffin or any other member of the roster. And as the authority in charge of managing sensitivities and arbitrating disagreements, Rivers increasingly grew entangled with the rest of the egos.""  &gt; The piece paints Rivers as something of a locker room politician who had ""a tendency to placate a player by telling him what he wanted to hear"" or even critiquing a player behind his back to another.  &gt; While a level of politicking is normal in any locker room, many Clippers reportedly saw Rivers as somewhat fake  [Source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2769961-chris-paul-reportedly-told-steve-ballmer-doc-rivers-contributed-to-clippers-exit)  Didn't lose his locker room ""at all,"" huh?"
"Uh, yeah if you’re Clint Capela or DeAndre Jordan. Zion makes all his own shots at the rim by himself. This is like saying Shaq and Giannis’ TS isn’t impressive."
"Lol people always use this like players are some amazing judges of talent. Remember the player choice awards where Deandre Jordan won DPOY and Kawhi/Draymond (the top two vote getters that year) weren’t even finalists?   Players suck at this too dude, it’s a popularity contest when you have them vote."
There’s a difference between Zion creating his own shot in the low-post and DeAndre Jordan catching lobs from Chris Paul
"Kats efficiency is a bit different though cause he’s actually a great shooter and shoots a ton of jumpers opposed to Zion shooting mainly in the paint. It’s like saying deandre Jordan is as efficient as KD. Like yes it’s true, but comparing flat efficiency for players that shoot jumpers vs players that doesn’t will always be a bit skewed"
"Thank god for Marc bringing all around center play back. I remember every year dreaming that Dwight would develop an offensive game. I think many thought the position was dead with the transition to more three point shooting and more pick and rolls creating the need for a bunch of Tyson Chandler, Deandre Jordan clones.   With sports though, everything is cyclical. The pendulum swings so far that everyone is spaced out and all the centers are super lean, athletic and less bulky and then you see a return of big, dominant, powerful post play. I love it!"
Deandre Jordan.
"DeAndre Jordan fell to the second round because there were “character issues and questions” so to speak, if you can believe that. Insane."
I'll take Dragic over Deandre Jordan

"I absolutely hate the culture of the league between things like The Jump, House of Highlights, and World Wide Wob. It is so fucking easy now for anyone who is only mildly into the NBA to see every highlight and hear every notable storyline. And with Woj notifications, people know Free Agent news the second it happens without having to invest anything. I really deeply miss 2014 and 2015 when we had those crazy free agencies that only hardcore fans really knew everything about. The DeAndre Jordan hostage crisis and the Banana Boat picture on the same day was one of the funniest things of all time and it would be insufferable nowadays."
"ben simmons is a pretty obvious one, he could look to score more aggresively if he knew that reddick or curry were the ones going to shoot fts  drummond, deandre jordan are others who benefit  Honestly, I don't actually know who'd get hurt by it"
Chris Paul  James Harden  DeMar DeRozan  Karl Malone  DeAndre Jordan? Idk for this one
But what volume should I expect from Deandre Jordan?
"Maaaaaaaybe.  I guess if you want to be as specific as ""200 different skills"", you might be technically correct.  But that's kind of absurd to break it down to that level.  But if we're talking about the major skill categories - shooting, dribbling, driving, passing, rebounding, defending, etc. there's &lt;1% chance you (the average you, mabye actual you played D1 or something) are better than any NBA player at anything.  People take the fact that NBA players fill roles on their teams, and confuse that with the idea that they've *always* filled those limited roles across their whole arc of development.   DeAndre Jordan, who is rightfully never asked to dribble the ball in an NBA setting, would cross your shit up and blow by you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-atBhpgSlI  Dwight, who only shoots kind of as a garbage time joke in the NBA, would step back and hit 3's in your face if he wanted.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_BYKlwGrRQ  Shaq, who since he was 12 could just overpower and dunk on people and didn't even need to develop out that other skillset if he didn't want to, has a nice little handle and wet jumper he could use on you when there's not NBA game pressure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxZxKUQ0xaE"
"Not sure how unpopular some of these are, but I'll throw some out:  - **LeBron is the GOAT and the distance between him and MJ isn't as close as some think.**  Not a long argument for me. LeBron's all-around game is better, and he's doing better over a longer period of time, often with far less talent around him and during the basketball renaissance across the globe that's happened over the past ~15 yrs. that has made the level of competition greater than it's ever been.  Take a look at some of those Cavs teams that LeBron drug to the Finals. I think the Cavs' Finals win over the Warriors is more impressive than any of the Bulls' titles.  While I'm here, I think the distance between Kareem and MJ is closer than MJ and LeBron.  - **If not for Dirk, the Mavs would consistently be considered one of the worst run franchises in the NBA.**  The more that comes out about the culture behind the scenes the more it kind of makes sense why they could never land a big free agent, even DeAndre Jordan.  Subsequently, I think many consider Dirk one of the best to ever play, but I think - due to his ability to carry this team to so much winning despite the people running the team from Cuban on down, I think we may actually be underrating Dirk's greatness nowadays, despite how great we already think he is.  Their title v. the Heat looks even more impressive and makes me think higher of Carlisle too.  Suns will do fine with Ayton, and ATL is doing fine with Trae, so if it wasn't for the Kings being the Kings and not taking Luka, the Mavs would currently be recognized right now as one of the NBA's top clusterfucks of a franchise.  - **It may be time to for the Spurs to force Pop out in a polite way.**  First, let me say, I think Pop can still coach. I think the Olympics proved that. But I also think that's the better type of team for him to be coaching at this point in his career, an all-star level team or a team with several stars.  Obviously, all of us know what he's meant to the Spurs franchise, but Budz is gone, Ime is gone, and they may lose out on Becky if they don't set a plan in place. (Which, there doesn't seem to be one if she's still interviewing heavy for other jobs.)  At some point, especially for a franchise like the Spurs who may keep the coach a long-time, you need to be thinking about the future, and as someone who likes Ime and Becky (and thinks Budz and Brown may be a bit underrated), there just seems to be a lot of brain drain from the coaching staff in favor of keeping the oldest coach in the NBA.  - **The Jazz are one of the most overrated franchises in the NBA.**  Congrats on the Top 4 seeds, and consistency. Yes, consistently not mattering when it matters most. I think a lot of people in the media like that the Jazz make competent moves (they don't often hit big, but also don't often fail big), and the idea of what the Jazz could be, rather than what they are - consistently forgettable. Play the game the right way and all that.  Donovan Mitchell will realize this too and get tired of being consistently solid when he leaves in a couple of years."
Shoutout deandre jordan
"no, they dont say that, because shooting percentages is not analytics, is only looking how many points a player gets per shot on average. there is no complicated formula there  disagreeing would be like saying deandre jordan doesnt score more per shot than Michael Jordan (he does by a lot) or doesnt have a higher field goal %  actual analytics would compare them to the average of the league they played in, not the raw numbers  it also would look at stuff like plus/minus, how good the rival was, how much better the team was with each player on"
"I know what you're trying to say, but that's unlikely. There is probably a singular basketball skill or two that a lot of people can be better at than DeAndre Jordan or any other role-player, but it's the other 200 skills that aren't even close.   Not trying to say any of us could compete on an NBA court or even close, but I bet there are a few people here that can shoot a better free throw, or thread a better chest pass, or have a tighter handle than a few NBA players.  None of it would translate to an NBA contract, but still."
He’s basically a young DeAndre Jordan
"1. Damian Lillard is not good enough to be the #1 option , he should’ve been like Kyrie. Perfect number 2.  2.James Harden is better than D-Wade on pure skill while wade has the accolades.  3. Luka is a top 5 player and better than AD.  4. Nets won’t win the finals as last as Deandre Jordan is on the team , finessing 10m and a quality roster spot.(yes we know the reason he is there is cuz he is friends with Kd)  5. Heat will lose in the first round again.   6. Warriors will also lose in the first round , idk if this is unpopular."
MVP finishes too. All NBA nods are already subjective because the center spot has been historically easy to get since the 00s. Guys like DeAndre Jordan have all NBA nods because the weakness of the position.
"All-NBA teams are easily worse than tiers lmao, at least tiers don’t have arbitrary positional restrictions for a team that doesn’t actually play any games together.   For example, DeAndre Jordan was not one of the 5 best players in 2016."
We literally refused trade offers that included Deandre Jordan because we want to pay him $10 million per year for the next two years to sit on the bench and not play.
Maybe he should use some of that money to destroy the tape of DeAndre Jordan posterizing him
Yes but if that's the only type of passing play he can execute consistently then he's still not a good playmaker relative to other players in a similar role.  It's like arguing DeAndre Jordan is a great scorer because he's efficient at catching lobs. That's only one type of play to score.
"A veteran presence? The Lakers are the oldest team in the league. The Nets have three future Hall of Famers in their 30s, plus guys like DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. Same for the Warriors with Curry, Klay, and Draymond.   All of these teams have multiple veteran guys who’ve won titles and more who’ve been in the playoffs multiple times, but you think they need to bring in a guy who can’t contribute to winning a title just because he’s old?"
deandre jordan would like to have a word
"Perhaps you missed this part: ""the *57 players* in the USA basketball pool (not just the final roster) were subject to drug testing:""  [Here's the full list.](https://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2021/03/m-oly-finalists.aspx) In addition to the final Olympics roster, it includes players like LeBron, AD, CP3, Steph, Dame, Kyrie, Harden, Kawhi, Paul George, Westbrook, Butler, Lowry, etc. That's pretty much a who's who of prominent American players in the latter half of their careers.  Also, you've got the next generation of superstars in Trae Young, Tatum, Zion, Donovan Mitchell; then there's the class of guys who used to be elite and might be especially tempted to juice to battle the effects of injury or general decline: Kemba, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, K-Love, John Wall, Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, and Dwight Howard. That's a whole lot of guys signing up for DUI checkpoints."
Hyland DeAndre Jordan

"If the 60's was watered down and all of the achievements of the greats back then are tarnished because of that, than why do people give so much credit to Lebron for making it 8 straight finals in the east which has been comparatively the weakest conference in the history of the NBA?  Despite the pool of teams being smaller, the talent of the NBA was much more concentrated. They still played 82 games a year and since there were a smaller amount of teams, this gave coaches a bigger role in their team by being able to strategize and target specific players. In todays NBA there's 30 teams across 82 games, you're less worried about strategies to beat other teams than you are strategizing to maximize your teams output. This is why when playoffs come and you play a team, your coach makes adjustments then rather than in the regular season. In the 60-70's, every regular season game felt more like a playoff game because you would see the same teams way more than 2-4 times a year.  Regardless of all that, you can safely say that Wilt is the most athletic player in NBA history by measuring his capability through the limited amount of videos of his prime. Basically a 7'1"" faster, taller and stronger Lebron James in terms of athletic freak and believe it or not he probably had a more consistent fade away jumper than Lebron from 16 feet in. Something like that in todays league would would be considered unstoppable. You can see his greatness by the amount of records he still holds.   Then when you take that into consideration, Bill Russell was just about as athletic as Wilt was! He was just not as tall, skilled at scoring, or as strong as Wilt. He basically had a super team for most of his career tho which is why Wilt is usually higher than Bill Russell in the GOAT list but Bill's speed and jump height was phenomenal even by todays standards. A DeAndre Jordan or Andre Drummond in the 60's would be forgettable players behind Wilt and Bill Russell just because of how overwhelming more athletic they were than those two."
1. “Anyone who knows anything about basketball” knows that Jordan was better than Hakeem even though Hakeem was a great player. I don’t really feel like having this argument right now though.  2. Deandre Ayton is not nearly as good as Hakeem so this discussion is fucking irrelevant
Ben Simmons is the worst all star since Deandre Jordan
"They can. It’s called “[Free Agency Moratorium](https://www.nba.com/news/free-agency-explained#moratorium):   &gt; “The Free Agency Moratorium is a negotiation period from Aug. 2-6 in which teams may not sign most free agents or make trades. Starting at 6 p.m. ET on Aug. 2, teams may negotiate deals with free agents. However, those players cannot officially sign until 12:01 p.m. on Aug. 6.  &gt; Any deals struck during the moratorium period are characterized as agreements, but do not count toward team salary and are not binding for the player or team. Either side can back out in this situation — a scenario that took place in 2015 when DeAndre Jordan reneged on his verbal agreement with the Dallas Mavericks to instead re-sign with the then-incumbent LA Clippers.”  Edit: formatting"
DeAndre Jordan was not only a great player but is a too shelf guy off the court and I’m sick of the disrespect he’s given around here.
He compares favorable to Deandre Jordan when both were at their primes.
"DeAndre ""Ben Simmons"" Jordan  The edit of the music makes it seem a lot more romantic lol"
"It's almost like that window already exists as the moratorium which is why teams don't announce the deals till days after Shams or Woj reports them cause they aren't official yet. They are just verbally agreed to, which is how we ended up with the DeAndre Jordan situation where Mark Cuban was driving around Houston begging (thru texts) for the address to Jordan's home when he backed out of the deal they agreed to earlier in the week."
"Great, now the Nets have the Australian GOAT and Deandre Jordan?!"
"Of course centers are going to have higher efficiencies, they're getting fed the ball near the rim.     DeAndre Jordan has near 65% TS%, but no one would pick him over Shaq or Gasol for offense as his arsenal is limited.   But there's definitely no doubt what the OP said about scoring.   &gt;Kobe is way better at scoring than Tim imo  When a guard had the same efficiency as a power forward/center with greater points per game."
"He was a quality high end roleplayer for a time but that was his peak. While I believe CP3 hindered Blake’s development by putting them in “win now” mode immediately (and also removing the idea of Point Blake), he unlocked every damn ounce of potential from DeAndre Jordan."
I still can’t believe when we look back at that ordeal it was all over DeAndre Jordan.
I low key feel bad for him. He had so much potential coming out of high school. He was one of the best in the country. Riddled with injuries and the historic lob dunk victim of Deandre Jordan really derailed Knight’s career. Props for him not just throwing in the towel. He’s still out there trying to make a comeback. Hat off to him.
"The “Mavs finished 2nd team” would be absolutely fearsome. Lowry, Whiteside, Dwight, Iggy, Deron Williams, DeAndre Jordan. Who else am I missing Mavs fans?"
Also finished second in the 2015 Deandre Jordan sweepstakes
chandler parsons and deandre jordan briefly
DeAndre Jordan for sure
Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons is always the answer. Regardless of fanbase. Always Ben Simmons. Jk.   Probably DeAndre Jordan will catch some heat considering he sucked so hard for the Nets last season. Basically Andre Drummond 2.0
Our entire team is essentially new but my bet is gonna be DeAndre Jordan.
"You ignore one thing, though: with one more roster spot left to fill, the Lakers are 13-players deep. This mean that they won't be forced to play anyone major minutes this season.   For instance, Westbrook is the starting PG obviously, but behind him is Kendrick Nunn, Rajon Rondo, and even THT (who plays SG too) who ran the point at times last season. For shooting guard, they have four or five guys that can play the spot. For center there is AD, D. Howard and DeAndre Jordan - all legit big men.  So yeah, health is always a concern and the average age of the Lakers isn't encouraging. However, by being so deep as a team (and they still have to get one more player which I hope is a SF/PF) a lot of this should be mitigated since no one has to play a ton of minutes."
"Celtics either make the Finals (!) or have a complete flameout season similar to Kyrie's last year and lose in R1  Schroder is a solid starting PG, Timelord has the opportunity to be DeAndre Jordan lob threat, Smart is a DPOY candidate and could be a 6MOY candidate on the right team, Brown is going to be crazy confident after getting his first all star nod, and Horford off the bench in limited minutes is a good piece still.  The team has a lot of potential. Butttt....   Timelord could get injured, Schroder could hunt for stats for his next contract, Brown could regress, Horford could fall off a cliff, Tatum could get irritated that he's carrying the team and everything could fall apart.   I don't see things landing anywhere in between."
Right.  Thats a trade the Pelicans dont make.  The Nets had to include 4 2nd round picks to move DeAndre Jordan.  DeAndre on his current deal has less value than an expiring JJ.
"JJ for DAJ may not have been a bad move all things considered.  Especially considering that this past offseason they had to give Detroit 4 second rounders and like 6 million dollars to take his contract. At the trade deadline DAJ was completely out of Nash's rotation in favor of giving C minutes to Bruce fucking Brown lmao, I'd have pulled the trigger on even washed JJ over DeAndre Jordan if I was brooklyn"
"Regular season /= postseason. For one, Deandre Jordan was playing in the regular season but didn’t touch the floor in the postseason"
Deandre Jordan
Okay.  Now tell me why coveted FA’s like Wayne Ellington &amp; DeAndre Jordan decided to go to the Lakers on a minimum when almost every team in the league wanted to sign them for the max.
Yeah and it isn't like this is new for Doc. After the Clippers lost Chris Paul he was asked in Blake and DeAndre could win a title and his answer was   “We think we can win a title building around him [Jordan] and Blake. You also need room in the budget for other people.”  And everyone knew after 2 first round losses in a row and Chris Paul leaving that the team was dead in the water as far as contending for a title.  When someone asks you if a guy you are paying a max salary on a long term contract is a championship player saying Yes should be a reflex.
*trades KAT to the Lakers for Carmelo and Deandre Jordan*
"I know I’m not super old or anything but those Lob City Clippers were the most talented team I’ve seen not even make it to the Finals.   Prime Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Deandre Jordan, JJ reddick? That team was stacked."
"Because it's not actually easier, it's one of the weirdest basketball myths that has insane staying power for some reason. Personally I think it's because everyone likes to jump on the ""haha dumb jock"" - if it was really a magic pill then people would have done it. It's not worse but there is very little evidence to suggest it will somehow fix a bad free throw shooter.   The ""proven by science!!!"" that people go to was physics paper someone wrote showing that underhanded freethrows have a slightly better chance of going in **if you can control the release angle and speed** AKA if you already have good touch. They also show that if you can't, overhand shots are more accurate. They also note the difference is slight either way.  Chinanu Onuaku is not a good free throw shooter. He's been in the 60s pretty much his entire career (he had one season in the GLeague at 73% - DeAndre Jordan has also shot 70% before) - he's improved somewhat after shooting 47% (on only 30 FTA so hardly indicative to begin with) as a freshman but plenty of free throw shooters have made just as big improvements. He shot 59.8% last year overseas.   Yes, Rick Barry shot 90% from the FT line. He was also one of the best shooters in the league. He would have shot well regardless of overhand or underhand."
"The sample size is like one person who was a terrible FT shooter shooting it underhand for one season. And no, you can't just pick it up over one weekend and become a decent FT shooter because you are shooting it under hand. And DeAndre Jordan got as high as 77% ft shooting with the Knicks."
"The entire Lob city era was filled with drama and issues and only way Doc managed through it was because he was there during the Sterling drama.  Clippers had the Chris Paul/Blake stuff,  Doc telling everyone DeAndre Jordan hacking wasn’t a issue when it was, the nepotism with bringing in Austin Rivers, Doc when he was the GM signing players to deals and giving them different roles as a coach, media telling him to play SGA when he was obsessed with playing Avery Bradley, and his track record handling young player in general"
2010: LeLeave  2011: LeChoke  2012: Dwightmare   2013: Dwightmare pt 2/Kobe (Everyone was shitting on kobe after dwight left)  2015: DeAndre Jordan
"his team played the third slowest pace in the league in 88, so adjusting for pace to the average in the league (about 100 poss per game, of which jordan played about 87.5 per game), and Jordan did the 2021 equivalent of posting 35/8.6/8.6 with 3 stls every game.  That'd put him 5th in assists, first in points, and 17th in boards per game, with almost double the steals of 5th place Jrue Holiday, and the same league adjusted TS% as Deandre Ayton."
Everyday there’s always a random article of a scrub or low tier role player saying how easy it was to sign with LA.  I swear I saw a DeAndre Jordan article a day after he signed with LA.
I get:  1. LeBron 2. Kareem 3. Russ 4. Hakeem 5. Wilt 6. MJ 7. Vucevic 8. Bill Russell 9. Drummond 10. Brook Lopez 11. Valanciunas 12. DeMarcus Cousins 13. Tim Duncan 14. Kobe 15. Horford 16. Myles Turner 17. Marc Gasol 18. DeAndre Jordan 19. Steven Adams 20. Giannis 21. Pau 22. Kanter 23. Nurkic 24. Robin Lopez 25. LaMarcus Aldridge 26. McGee 27. Rose 28. Ibaka 29. Kidd 30. Steph 31. Dwight Howard 32. Shaq 33. Blake Griffin 34. KD 35. Kevin Love 36. Kelly Olynyk 37. Dame 38. AD 39. LaVine 40. Jokic 41. CP3 42. Pippen 43. Barkley  Very big-heavy. Something like 3/4 are bigs.
I haven’t had this much fun since the Deandre Jordan and Dallas debacle.
and DeAndre Jordan
I do think the American sports rivalries suffer due to this sorta stuff. Not necessarily with Deandre Jordan in particular but coming from a European soccer background it was shocking to see the positive or neutral reaction to rondo playing for LA.
We actually have good 3 point shooters but near non existent big men depth. DeAndre Jordan isn't good and Dwight's best role is clearly a back up. I hope to hell Anthony Davis follows through on his alleged desire to play more center
"I was trying to give you the benefit of a doubt, but maybe your brain isn't a good asset. You saying it was ""obvious"" about the bubble a year ago is bullshit. The bubble was extremely experimental and most people thought it wouldn't be successful enough to finish the Playoffs. Compared to now,, no one knew anything about covid, and everyone was scared of the ramifications of getting it.     Bradley Beal, Davis Bertans, DeAndre Jordan, and Spencer Dinwiddie all sat out the bubble. And guess what, they're all on teams. So I have no clue where you're getting this ""people don't want him because he wasn't in the bubble"" nonsense.     **The guy isn't as good as he used to be**. That's the only reason teams need not to sign him. But its weird you seem so hellbent on making it about covid."
The honorable mention (#6) should just be a picture of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.
"Not a top 5 play, but I think always deserves recognition  “Oh what a monster jam by Deandre Jordan!”"
Personally I would have   5. Deandre Jordan (such a dunk)  4. Curry's Fvck you 3  3. Ray Allen's 3  2. Lebron Block   1. Kyrie Irving's Shot
"[IF YOU'RE WATCHING THESE HIGHLIGHTS, WATCH THIS VIDEO. This series is my favourite series of NBA basketball ever. This video captures it really well. Can't tell you how many times I've replayed this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrMky4VN924&amp;ab_channel=MaxaMillion711)  I'll never forget the anger I had due to the rebounding in this series. You can see in the fourth quarter of this game alone how many times they had 3 or 4 Offensive Rebound attempts. Spurs were an ATG team and the Clippers put up a hell of a fight.  This series really had **everything**.   - Back and forth wins by both teams, check.  - Home and Away wins for both teams, check.  - Defending champion Spurs being favourited by the media, check.  - Superstars AND role players for both teams stepping up big time, check. (Boris Diaw was insane that series)  - Blake Griffin with a key game-losing turnover  - DeAndre Jordan goaltending Blake's potential game tying/winning shot, costing us the game.  - Spurs blowing the Clippers out (From memory I think this was the franchise's biggest playoffs loss ever at the time) (27pts)  - Chris Paul, the Clippers most impactful player in the series, gets injured in Game 7.  - Chris Paul hits insane game-winner  - Shot clock fiasco at the end of Game 7 which *definitely* gave the Clippers an advantage.  This is straight out of a fairytale."
"There’s levels to this shit lmao. To me, a paint hog is deandre jordan or mcgee, guy who literally cannot do anything unless he’s in the paint. Shaq caught it in the midrange area half the time and got way more soft short range jumpers in than you think based off the highlights only"
PG: De'aaron Fox SG: Bradley Beal SF: Lebron PF: Siakam  C: Giannis  Jordan Clarkson Lou Williams Joe Ingles DeAndre Jordan Blake Griffin Buddy Hield Thybulle
Bird was a savage huh?! Lmao  What deandre Jordan moment are you talking about?
"Magic got the nickname Tragic Johnson after poor clutch play in the 84 finals, specifically when he dribbled out the last 9 seconds of regulation without shooting in a tied Game 2 (Celtics won in OT).  It was basically a JR Smith/DeAndre Jordan moment, but much worse.  https://youtu.be/YQ1bd2g3p1Y"
"He could have and would have totally bounced to some other contender eventually, post-Lebron leaving Miami. Like, wouldn’t it have made so much sense if he eventually replaced Deandre Jordan on the Blake/cp3 clippers? Or maybe he’s the guy who would’ve eventually went to milwaukee, not Brook Lopez. We really got screwed. He was built for this modern style."
"Yeah there’s actually tons of material lol. There’s the Donald Sterling situation, beating the Spurs then blowing the 3-1 lead to the Rockets, the Deandre Jordan free agency saga. Then all the locker room drama that led to them splitting up. And not to mention how exciting they were to watch on the court."
Deandre Jordan leading the league in FG% vibes lol
They should put it on the Jumbotron when lebron passes deandre Jordan in boards. Maybe just say say he passed Jordan.
I think this every time I see guys like Drummond and Deandre Jordan put up jumpshots during shoot-around. Like...why?
"I agree peak Dray was scary but Deandre jordan received all nba and I don’t think he was top 10 at all, it’s position based not a ranking"
Lol no one cares about TS% as much as VORP for MVP.  Otherwise DeAndre Jordan would be GOAT at 74% last year.
"Shaq would body Giannis on offense (Giannis is also not more athletic imo). Deandre Jordan was giving Giannis difficulty getting to the basket during the regular season, he was just played off the floor when the bucks spammed Middleton Giannis pnr because he doesn't step far enough out the paint to even contest a midrange properly. Shaq wouldn't have trouble defending Giannis the questions are how well he can factor into modern team defense and how much would his offensive output justify any defensive struggles."
Absolutely none at all.  Of course he bullshits on Twitter vids but he hasn't taken a shot more than arms length away from the rim.  The closest to an in game situation where he shoots the ball is from the line and that's it.  If he can just be a solid FT shooter then that's more than enough.  More than even DeAndre Jordan.
"DeAndre Jordan was first team so that's all you need to know.  Horford was good but his stat line was a bit underwhelming especially with Atlanta only winning 48 games. Towns had a decent rookie season, but it's hard to give a rookie All NBA honours when they win under 30 games. Anthony Davis had the numbers, but missed too many games (and New Orleans was a bad team). It's hard to argue against Pau but him and Drummond were pretty neck and neck."
He’s a maxed 2021 Deandre Jordan lol
DeAndre Jordan was 1st team. Not a great year for centers.
"idk why but i consider 16-6-6 to be the lamelo statline.  trae young owns the 30-10+ games for me.  deandre jordan, dwight howard and robert williams are 7-14-3 block guys.  can't forget the bradley beal 35-2-3"
"I don’t see how age is an issue when they are more athletic than the Jazz roster. Literally our only nonshooters are Russ, Dwight, and DeAndre Jordan so ok. You also believe that any team that plays inside can’t beat the Jazz when the Jazz haven’t won shit with Gobert. So yeah, delusional"
"Age doesn't really matter all that much to a point. Yes a player might be a bit slower, jump less higher, but their experience should counterbalance that. What it does impact a lot is how far off the cliff a player falls after a certain number of minutes. Not managing that correctly is the main issue. And yes, at a certain point, that number becomes 2-3 minutes and the player is unfit for NBA. But if it's 10-15, then make sure they only play that many minutes. Trying to start someone like DeAndre Jordan and expect 30 minutes out of him is insanity. But he should be able to give 5 hot minutes and 5 decent minutes and maybe 5 more minutes after a lengthy rest."
"Are you trying to imply this user’s comment history is full of Kyrie hate? That’s what I thought you were saying but at least in the past month of comments, I don’t see any evidence of that.  There were only two comments in the past month about Kyrie: one about how something must’ve changed between kyrie/kd and deandre jordan for him to leave, and one saying that the Celtics wouldn’t have been able to keep Rozier even if they never traded for Kyrie which was a defense of Kyrie if anything."
I'd easily take him over Drummond or Deandre Jordan
"Why’s there always some irrelevant Deandre Jordan post on this sub.  Who cares, he sucks."
28 other teams say it ‘was not a very tough decision’ to not pick DeAndre Jordan in free agency
"He is the 2nd coming of Jordan, just that its DeAndre.... Watch some highlights (lowlights of him) Couldnt get a layup properly..."
"Expecting a lot of a 36 year old, sounds deandre Jordan 2.0"
I still don’t get the DeAndre Jordan thing. Like did the Lakers actually watch him play last season?
"We made one trade with Dallas — KP + THJ + Courtney Lee + Trey Burke…for…DSJ + Wesley Matthews + Deandre Jordan + Picks. DSJ is the only guy who stuck with the Knicks(Matthews and Jordan played a combined 22 games for the Knicks), though DSJ was traded for Derrick Rose last year.    Other than that trade…what is this “constantly swapping players” narrative? This off-season the Mavs signed Bullock and apparently plan to sign Ntilikina, so I understand the “Mavericks are Knicks-south” narrative…with these two moves, and the 3 remaining players from the KP trade, the Mavs might have 5 players on their active roster this season who played for the Knicks within the past few years. But the Knicks will have 0 former Mavs on their roster."
"Personally I too feel that Deandre Jordan is going to be under utilized. Fate of the earth on the line, I want Deandre “Michael” Jordan to take the three /s"
Deandre Jordan
"Gobert is a regular season machine, but a liability in the playoffs. Even without Kawhi on the court he got targeted every possession and was leaving 2pt shooters wide open because he wouldn't leave the paint.  Every team is loaded with shooters, your 2nd best player cant be a slightly better DeAndre Jordan and expect to make it far in the playoffs, we've seen that since the Warriors won their first title in 2015.  Also, I bet the Warriors, Lakers, Hawks, Sixers, Clippers, Nuggets and Nets all think they could have won if they were healthy."
Tim Duncan played during a time when that was feasible. He’s probably be a full time center today because playing with him with a DeAndre Jordan type would pose major issues.
Usually in these cases I’d say “it’s better than nothing” but in the case Of Deandre Jordan I don’t think that is true.
The problem is that washed Gasol is still better than Drummond or Deandre Jordan. Just wait for it.  Lakers started the season well with Gasol starting. I am not sure if they win the same amount of games if you replace Gasol with Drummond.
DeAndre Jordan on the Clippers was a lot more athletic and he had a lot more touch. Drummond can’t finish nearly as well.
Yeah and deandre Jordan is a force to be reckoned with now that's he's on the Lakers :)
"*Lakers proceed to acquire Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard and DeAndre Jordan in the year of our lord 2021*"
Drummond would be okay if played like DeAndre Jordan on the Clippers. The moment this guy dribbles the ball or brings it up I just cringe because I know this guy is going to lose it. He's just so uncoordinated. And for some reason nobody stops them from trying to post up and doing all the shit. 80% of the time and results in him losing the ball. Sucks at free throw so you can't play me the 4th and close games. 76ers are on crack because now they have 2 players they can't play in the 4th
defenses: the way DeAndre Jordan can't do anything on offense help us to load up against LeBron James and Russell Westbrook from getting to the rim.
"This is hilarious coming from DeAndre ""Ballwatching Statue"" Jordan."
Deandre Jordan can still defend the rim somewhat decently but if he has to guard a pick and roll it’s wraps.
Everybody talking about the wrong Jordan. It's obviously DeAndre. Michael who?
"In terms of free throws, in 2019 DeAndre Jordan was making them at an absurd percentage for a period in Dallas, I think it was even sitting at 89% at the start of the season with quite some games played. [Article](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/12/5/18126305/deandre-jordan-free-throws-mavericks) for those that forgot about this.  &amp;nbsp;  [Mike James](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesmi01.html) in 2006 defined an anomaly season. If you [look at the 2006 season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2006_per_game.html) and sort this list by PPG, you'll notice that EVERY big name player was getting crazy numbers.    If you were a borderline All-Star you were getting All-Star numbers, if you were an All-Star you looked like a star, if you were a star you looked like a superstar, if you were Allen Iverson you averaged 33/7 and nobody remembers because Kobe averaged 35. This was due to final adjustments made on handchecking that made it a field day for people scoring (especially points in the paint).    It still didn't explain how Mike James jumped so high in scoring with 47/44/94 splits, so he wasn't simply chucking."
"There are a ton of NBA players who have incredible skills in some area but are missing a few fundamental pieces. I'm sure a guy like DeAndre Jordan had to learn how to play in the post or work on his midrange jimmy in high school, but those skills aren't what got him in the NBA. That's why player development still exists in the NBA"
FT are just one part of the game tho. Russell’s lack of offense would hurt the team. If you’re only going to use him as a PnR player than at that point he is an over glorified DeAndre Jordan. Russell ain’t some elite scoring threat but you can’t just use him as a PnR player. Especially if his teammate isn’t a shooter.   If you want to say Russell would be a Giannis/AD level PnR threat than I can assume Wilt would be a a mobile Embiid/Jokic hybrid. He had shooting and passing and was super agile for his size.
DeAndre Jordan holding the ball at the end of a tie game while Chris Paul jumps up and down losing his shit: https://youtu.be/XNxr0m3YkX0
"...You and I have very different opinions on what ""aging well"" means then. For me, Blake has aged well. He can still go even if it's not at an all star caliber level. If you want a good example of NOT aging well, look no further than DeAndre Jordan. Night and day difference between these two."
"That's great in theory, except that Dallas won't have cap space either. The article makes the point that it doesn't look like anybody really will:  &gt; On Aug. 15, HoopsHype's [Yossi Gozlan](https://twitter.com/YossiGozlan/status/1426990210735173637?s=19) projected that seven teams would have cap space next offseason. Since then, four of those teams have cut into that space significantly. Boston extended several players, Charlotte extended Terry Rozier and signed Kelly Oubre, New Orleans re-signed Josh Hart and Detroit acquired and waived DeAndre Jordan. The remaining three all have meaningful players whose possible extensions could and likely will cut into their space as well: Memphis has Jaren Jackson, San Antonio has Lonnie Walker and Orlando has Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter.   Now it's always possible some teams could shuffle things around to try to open up space for Beal or LaVine, but until that happens it's not much of a bluff on their part to say ""trade me or I'll walk."""
Damn Deandre Jordan is useless
"With the departure of Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan will indeed have a larger role in the Lakers' rotation this season.  In the playoffs, it will be different as Anthony Davis will likely be called upon to play the center more often and Howard will be the number 2."
Dallas:  PG: Tim Hardaway / Rajon Rondo / Sam Cassell  SG: Alex English / Richard Jefferson / Eddie Jones  SF: Peja Stojakovic / Antawn Jamison / Lamar Odom  PF: Dennis Rodman / Elton Brand / Antoine Walker  C: Amar'e Stoudemire / Andrew Bogut / DeAndre Jordan
Lakers are really giving DeAndre Jordan and Kent Bazemore larger roles...
That's a good one for sure. The Deandre Jordan on Brandon Knight one is up there for me too.
"&gt;LeBron could have just said ""No thanks, I'm committed to moving on""  I'm pretty sure that's what happened but do you think Riley would stop without actually trying to convince James?  If there was even a 0.01% chance Riley just needed to meet with James to change his mind I'm sure this is what occurred. DeAndre Jordan with CP3 and Blake Griffin stopped the Mavs trade.  I'm convinced LeBron learned from The Decision not to repeat that same mistake, I'm going to go out on a limb saying Riley probably thought to himself ""just give me 5 minutes with him, that's all I need!"". LeBron was already in Vegas wining and dining on his own dime... it's not the same where free agents travel to you for perks."
"My top are Pippen over Ewing, Blake's triple crown on Baynes, and DeAndre Jordan commiting murder on Brandon Knight."
"I will miss Gasol. His playmaking, 3pt shooting, and positional defense were all outstanding and he was hitting a really great stride before he got Covid and we signed Drummond.  Drummond was a Flex Seal patch on the bottom of the boat that was our center rotation at the time, so I bear no ill will to him (the ill will goes to whoever bent to his starting demands).  I have to move forward assuming his choice to retire to Spain came before the Deandre Jordan move, because I really want to *not* be bitter about how Marc’s tenure with LA went.  The Lakers are worse today than they were yesterday, but Marc retires with a ring, gets to retire from the Griz, and gets to spend some time playing in Spain with his brother; I’d call that more sweet than bitter."
Nets traded all their future picks for harden and the Lakers traded a lot for Westbrook.  That’s what I’m talking about not millsap and Deandre Jordan.   Warriors need to unload their war chest. They have 3 lotto picks and future picks for another star
"Personally I think it's moot when it comes to Love as I don't think he'll get bought out anyway. But otherwise I agree, that I'd rather see the Lakers get guys with some possible potential moving forward rather than just continuing to rack up all these vets. I wouldn't see Love as a big risk if he became available, but I also would see him as an extreme longshot of being a good meaningful signing either.   At the end of the day the Lakers are looking to fill their 13th, 14th and 15th roster spots, and I'd prefer they used them on guys with upside unless a truly good player becomes available, and Love ain't that. I think Love is, like they say in the military, ROAD: retired on active duty. I think DeAndre Jordan probably is as well, but they signed him too for some reason."
*Pistons Legend Deandre Jordan
"you are drunk !! Put the vape pen down go to rehab. Jordan over ewing, Pippen over ewing.Vince over Frederick weiss Tom chambers over Mark Jackson, Shawn Kemp over Alton Lister, Vince over Alonzo Mourning, I'll even take Deandre jordan over brandon knight or Blake griffen over Mosgov or Perkins get some help  and get some sunlight."
"Love is the only actual floor spacer that you mentioned there. Simply because of that he’s the clear #1 option for the Lakers.   The other guys have exactly 0 chance of playing meaning minutes in a playoff game over Dwight. And if we liked any of those guys over DeAndre Jordan, we would have signed them."
"Not a win for the Lakers. Marc Gasol still had his uses against the bigger centers and he was a good passer while being on a cheap role. But yeah, when they signed Deandre jordan looks like his retirement was imminent."
Wang Zhelin &gt; Deandre Jordan
Already have Dwight Howard and DeAndre Jordan plus AD
You really think deandre jordan will be a starter?
My favorite is when DeAndre Jordan baptized Brandon Knight
"Javale McGee was (and still is) playable. Not great, not good, but playable. Deandre Jordan isn't playable anymore. I literally rather see Boban playing than him. All DAJ could do was catch lobs, and he needed James Harden to help him on that.   If AD goes down before the deadline, the Lakers will be active to trade for a C."
Two time first team all-defense DeAndre Jordan!
"DeAndre Jordan clearly refuses to admit it's not 2016 anymore, in his mind he's a 28 year old All-Star."
"Durant has a bag, Giannis has strength and quickness. There is no particular reason to think one over the other. Shaq was unstoppable using 4 moves, literally 4 total and was playing like the best player ever. That's the issue with bag Twitter btw, they don't seem to get it: bag is great to have, but as a player gets bigger and bigger it is less and less important (still you need *some* moves, you can't be DeAndre Jordan out there and dominate)."
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
"Yea, I completely agree. I had a convo with someone about this who told me Ben Simmons has amazing shot selection, but I think you have to include the shots he doesn’t take. Did you know he averages a little over 1 ATTEMPT per game longer than 8 feet out? How can the primary ball handler of a team be that timid? It’s really selfish actually.   The Heat went to Duncan Robinson and told him he needed to take his open looks and that he was being selfish for not taking them. I understand Ben isn’t Duncan, but the same thing applies to a degree. He isn’t Deandre Jordan shooting. He’s just scared."
"Exactly. He always does that shit whether it's with Steven Adams, Deandre Jordan, whoever."
"Yes Jay, I find the Lakers intimidating. I'm so scared of them. I check under my bed for Deandre Jordan every night before I sleep."
"That's also with LeBron being unconscious from 3 to start the season. If he actually manages to stay at 45+% on 3s all season, that would be a big deal and would change my outlook on the offense. For now, I don't think he can keep that up. But we'll see! I certainly could be wrong.  I probably shouldn't have been so strong in my first statement. I didn't think about how much the Lakers' lineup and rotations will change once they get fully healthy. I'll reserve judgment once some of those guys get back, we see how much DeAndre Jordan plays, and we see if LeBron can keep up this shooting."
"The lakers were already thin last season, and then they traded their remaining depth for Russ and let Caruso walk. They had to fill out like 10 roster spots with minimum players, and while some of those guys were good for a minimum, they're still bench guys at best. The lakers need THT and Kendrick Nunn to come back and play great, because you cannot win a championship starting Kent Bazemore and Deandre Jordan."
The Simba memes were great at this point in meme history. I remember the one of DeAndre Jordan dunking on like Brandon Jennings or someone with this shopped in. Too good.
"yeah, these 2 are a bit wreckless but forgivable due to effort and the one pass he made to deandre jordan, who didnt bother running to the ball, which led to a Dort fast break dunk, dont seem like his fault."
"You're complaining about things that TS isn't meant to do.  It's meant to be an improvement on FG% which also contains all of the exact same flaws you're complaining about.  By your same logic, we just shouldn't compare any stats between players who hold different roles. Everything you wrote applies to PPG as well. DeAndre Jordan gets his points through easier shots than Caris Levert. Welp, there's no use talking about them."
"I genuinely don’t know why people have the idea that Westbrook has this amazing will to win.  People act like he’s this super competitive player who does whatever it takes to grind out a win, and honestly it just doesn’t make sense to me.    To me, a player who wants to win more than anything shows their competitiveness by constant improvement.  They identify their own flaws and work on them until they can’t be exploited.  Guys like Lebron, Steph, KD, Giannis, Kawhi, etc. all had gaps in their games that they filled in because they wanted to win.   Westbrook, on the other hand, has been the same player since KD left 6 years ago.  Despite being bounced from the playoffs esrly every year while having the same flaws exposed in his game year after year, he’s refused to make even the smallest adjustment for the good of his team.    He still takes twice as many threes as he should be.  He still turns the ball over like it’s his job.  He still shoots his team out of games even when he’s ice cold.  He still prioritizes grabbing easy DRebs over getting out early in transition (something that is just inexcusable when you have Lebron, AD, Dwight Howard, and Deandre Jordan who are all great rebounders who are more that capable outlet passers).  He still dominates the ball despite not being even remotely the best player or ballhandler on the team.  He still hasn’t even grasped the fundamental concept of offball movement.    Just because a player has a high motor and an aggressive attitude doesn’t make that player a competitor.   Thanks for coming to my TedTalk."
Ahh the team of misfits:  Mr.Anthony “You’ll find me hobbling on the floor” Davis  Mr. Russel “I’m just jacking it” Westbrook  Mr. Carmelo “Don’t call me overrated” Anthony  Mr. Rajon “they call me tough” Rondo  Mr. Deandre “I just wanna be in LA eating veggies” Jordan  Mr. Dwight “I call myself Superman” Howard
"There is no valid reason Deandre Jordan is starting, because he only starts halves and because of that every minute he plays is with westbrook and it's a bad fit. I know wings are injured but for once, just so I can see it can we have; Russ, Monk/Reaves, LeBron, Melo, AD to start."
I hate looking at DeAndre Jordan on the court
There is no circumstance where Lou Williams and Deandre Jordan should come close to the hall of fame.
"I saw DeAndre Jordan on the streets of SF (2014 maybe?). The Clippers were in town for a playoff game. I stayed silent, but the buddy I was walking with yelled “Hey DeAndre you should have signed with us!” (meaning the Warriors)  DeAndre looked at my friend like he was an absolute simpleton and coldly replied “I did,” and then kept walking.   He had signed an offer sheet with the Warriors in 2011 that the Clippers matched. I’ve never let my buddy live it down."
"""The drill is, as always, is 'Is the player you're getting back more valuable than the potential you could get in the draft?'"" said Clippers general manager Neil Olshey. ""Our analysis at this point in February is that it was more valuable to get a 28-year-old All-Star point guard that we have for the next few years, cap flexibility to make sure we take care of business and re-sign DeAndre Jordan and have flexibility to take care of Eric Gordon as well, as opposed to speculating on another kid that's 19 years old with one year of college experience.  ""And I'm not that high on the draft to begin with this year.""  That’s his analysis and he was dead wrong flat out. He’s talking about Mo Williams. That’s a bad evaluation no matter what. They would have been better off letting Baron expire. There was a lot of value 1-15 in that draft. He just made a poor move."
"I still dislike Deandre Jordan when he was on the Mavs for how he was stealing rebounds from his teammates just to boost his stats. Several times a Mavs player was almost alone, gonna get the rebound and Deandre Jordan rushed to that spot and practically stole the rebound of his teammate's hands just to get that +1 in his rebound stat box. It was pretty sad and pathetic to watch. The man is beyond washed and past his prime."
why does deandre jordan not shoot 40 times a game instead of this bum lebron he shoots like 70%
"[Link](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/11/joe-harris-brooklyn-nets-subway-cleveland-lebron)  You def can take the train.  Here is an article about Joe Harris (Nets) and Jordan Montgomery (Yankees, does it 'daily' to the stadium).  [Link](https://gothamist.com/food/brooklyn-nets-player-deandre-jordan-loves-taking-the-subway-dunkins-new-beyond-meat-breakfast-sandwiches)  DeAndre Jordan used to take the subway.  I had seen Ron Darling on the 7.  I knew who he was.  No one bothered him.  He was talking to a fellow announcer whose name alludes me now."
Have you seen Deandre Jordan?
Starting DeAndre Jordan over him in Brooklyn was borderline negligence.  Im glad he’s getting his opportunity (and his money) in Cleveland.
"Also in the 20216-17 season:  Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan were starters who led the league in rebounds and were near the top in blocks.  Isaiah Thomas was the league's 3rd leading scorer.  John Wall led the league in steals and was 3rd in assists (edging out Ricky Rubio for his spot).  Kyle Korver, Allen Crabbe, Joe Ingles and Otto Porter were top 4 in 3pt accuracy.  DeMarcus Cousins set the high water mark for personal fouls.  Westbrook is the 4th oldest guy out of all the players I mentioned here."
Brandon Knight is one that I just wish he didn't try lol.  DeAndre Jordan truly made that man a child. No one would blame you for not trying to block that lol
"I honestly think he’s not as bad offensively as people say  Obviously efficiency is inflated when you rim roll but he’s still finishes at a higher percentage than similar play styles like Capela, that has to count for something in terms of his touch at the rim  His free throw shooting is questionable but at least he doesn’t shoot sub 50% like a DeAndre Jordan"
What's even dumber is all the idiots this summer saying Lakers will win or even that Lakers are unfair. Westbrook SUBTRACTS. And so does deandre Jordan at this point.
"Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler,  Kyle Korver, John Wall, Marcus Camby, Rajan Rondo, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Marc Gasol, Cedric Maxwell, Lou Willians, Jamal Crawford, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Demar Derozan, Andre Igoudala, Rudy Gobert and maybe DeAndre Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Paul Millsap should all be in the hall of fame"
"Hell with Russ, Deandre Jordan actually looks good."
"All of his highlights are dunks, but he’s got a very soft touch around the rim and not a bad jumpshot. He’s a lot finesse-ier than looks and his rebounding can be really on and off. I like him as a bouncier Brook Lopez (before he became a legit stretch 5) or Valanciunas. Another one I like is Ayton. I don’t hate the Noah comparison either.  I was just commenting on the number of people just throwing out DeAndre Jordan just because they see the dunks."
Dejounte is DJ? I meant deandre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan exists
DeAndre Jordan shouldn't play under any circumstances in the playoffs
I was told he was worse than deandre Jordan
Lakers are barely good enough to escape the play-in tournament and have little to no chance of winning the title.  * DeAndre Jordan is not playable * AD's instance on playing power forward  is killing all chances of succes. * AD is an overrated shooter. * Rando has no place on a roster with several bigs and Russel Westbrook * Ariza is completely washed * Their perimeter defense will not be good. They are too old and slow. Good shooters will have a field day against them. * The Lakers will be unable to make Westbrook work in the half court offense with bigs clogging the paint and LeBron handling the ball. * Good defensive teams such ass Milwaukee or Utah can exploit offensive the limitations of the Lakers. * Melo is not good enough to be a starter * Injuries are pretty much garuanteed to happen. * All these other dudes are not good enough to be difference makers.
Honestly Deandre Jordan sounds like a lazy comp but it’s fairly accurate. This isn’t an insult either cuz Prime Dj was a champion role player
He's pretty much DeAndre Jordan
Prime DeAndre Jordan
"I feel we know the lineup that works and what we will do in the playoffs. Its russ lebron, ad and 2 shooters at sg and sf, whichever of the bunch show up. But holy fucking SHIT does it burn my eyes to see deandre jordan starting for us. He. IS. NOT. MCGEE."
LeBron on Terry and DeAndre Jordan on Brandon Knight are impressive murders but it's not Vince dunking on that tall mf on the Olympics
DeAndre Jordan
He would have made it if he played more minutes. The Bulls are playing him more. Not surprising since Vogel is the type of coach to play Deandre Jordan over Dwight Howard.
"Lebron, Russell Westbrook, AD, Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Deandre Jordan  Vs.  Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iggy, Harrison Barnes  Why is that questionable?"
"Just to highlight how long ago 5 years is, 5 years ago, the following players played in the All Star Game: Isaiah Thomas, John Wall, Kevin Love, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, DeMarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan.  Those guys have had varying degrees of success since then, and contribute to winning, but when was the last time anyone thought of any of those guys as stars?"
Deandre Jordan
You guys haven't heard about DeAndre Jordan ?
"Wow, the more you look at the Lakers' boxscore, the less you like their chances.  DeAndre Jordan and Kent Bazemore starting? Austin Reeves with 18 minutes and Rondo with the DNP? Carmelo Anthony the 6th man? Anxiously awaiting Kendrick Nunn's return from injury?"
Each time he got on the floor good things happened for us. Gave me some AC feels. &lt;3  Screw DeAndre Jordan though my God get him off the floor.
Dwight. Especially if it means less minutes for deandre jordan.
"Absolutely. Ariza still is a good team defender who understands rotations and uses his long wingspan well.   Once he’s back, Deandre Jordan won’t play and AD will start at the 5 which helps the offensive spacing."
Can't believe Deandre Jordan has yet to miss an NBA check his whole career yet somehow Melo spent a season and a half doing hesi-pullup jimbos in the gym on IG to prove he was still worthy of being in the league.
How many shots at the rim did he take? I think Nate Duncan tweeted that he only took three over the first two games. It might be a symptom of playing with DeAndre Jordan and a garbage shooter in Westbrook so much but it’s still not a good sign
Because he made DeAndre Jordan look like a serviceable NBA center
Ja Morant is a bad motherfucker  DeAndre Jordan is bad
The answer is more Deandre Jordan.
Does Deandre Jordan have Frank Vogel's nudes or some shit? Why does he insist on playing him so much and alongside AD
DeAndre Jordan
 Deandre Jordan bum
I'd execute DeAndre Jordan instantly for that
I don't think this line up with DeAndre Jordan is working
"Deandre ""shooter for shooter"" Jordan"
Crazy that DeAndre fucking Jordan has been the best Laker on the floor so far
deandre jordan
I imagine they’ll win tonight but Deandre Jordan is not a starting center anymore.
DeAndre Jordan never played for the bulls…
All-NBA for Centers are kinda iffy in this era. DeAndre Jordan and Joakim Noah made first team All-NBA.
"Especially if you were AD, dude has to hide behind the ghost of DeAndre Jordan because he's afraid of guarding real centers"
"I’ll take a different tack and say Kwame Brown.  Yes he was ultimately a bust, but the Wizards did him no favors but throwing him into the deep end with a perfectionist bully in Michael Jordan and a franchise in win-now mode with no interest in developing a teenager.   Imagine if he’d had an environment like DeAndre Ayton had or James Wiseman has now.  Maybe things could have ended better."
They still traded DeAndre Jordan
"I have many. cam payne, jae crowder, jordan poole, jusuf nurkic, jj barea, pat bev, deandre jordan, james harden, kyle kuzma, raja bell, &amp; dahntay jones."
"When Deandre Jordan was your highlight in a Lebron led team, you know something Is wrong"
At the end of the day its still the GMs job to do the trades and signings. Signing DeAndre jordan and starting him isn't a good idea. Having Kent Bazemore start is a horrendous idea. That's why I'm putting the blame on the GM
Nunn would solve the Rondo-Westbrook lineup problem. Ariza might solve the DeAndre Jordan problem since AD will play more at the 5 while Ariza is at the 4.
"The roster is a rusted out Honda Civic being pushed to the gas station by two bodybuilders, and they are trying to sell it as if it's a BMW 7 series that just needs some engine work.   All of their players who can defend can't shoots. All of their players who can shoot can't do it reliably and can't defend at all. Deeply flawed is a kind way to describe this roster.  * The Lakers are paying Westbrook 41m dollars to be one of the least capable off-ball guards in the entire league, kill their spacing on offense, force the action every time he has an opportunity due to lack of touches, and turn the ball over 4-5 times a night in a baffling manner. He is a terrible shooter, he is a decidedly below average to bad defender at the most dangerous position in the league, and his decision making remains questionable at best; and he's being sold as the 3rd member of a ""Big 3"" to mirror the Nets. Kyrie might be less detrimental to the Nets than Westbrook is to the Lakers offense right now.  * Carmelo was graded as one of the worst defenders in the league the past two years and has to be hidden or pulled. It's possible that he could flirt with 40/40/85 this year on limited minutes, but he may give up as many points as he generates, provides no playmaking, no screening, no off-ball movement as he's a statue, and very little contested rebounding if any.  * Malik Monk has essentially all of the same flaws but is a worse shooter. He has upside as a defender if he can figure it out considering his physical tools and super long arms, but the Monk defensive tape from last year is nightmarish. Last thing the Lakers need as a ""championship team"" is a young streaky player who is learning to play passable defense.  * Rondo is Rondo. You'll get a coinflip on if he can make a 3 and a layup a game, or he wills core 0 points. He's the only person on the bench who can facilitate in a positive manner, but has slowed down making that playmaking much less dynamic, and his defense has fallen off a cliff.  * Avery Bradley has played for 7 different teams in 5 seasons, including getting traded back or picked up off waivers by some of those teams later on. He provides almost no value as a player anymore which is why Miami and LA/LAC tossed him in prior years. Washed as a defender and was never a good shooter.  * Austin Reaves is a 23 year old rookie on a supposedly contending team full of vets, who LA is playing due to depseration via injury.  * THT may very well be a solid defender this year and much needed in that regard for the Lakers. However he cannot shoot for shit meaning if he's on the floor with the starters then the starters are running WB and THT at the same time and have thrown their offense/spacing into a tar pit and will watch it slowly slip away along with whatever lead they may have.  * I like Nunn. I legitimately think if he's healthy and improved he could be the Lakers 3rd best player this year.  * Ariza is washed. Box score stats will fool anyone trying to be optimistic. He is extremely slow and his man defense is atrocious.  He will struggle the entire year with his speed, more injuries, and to get to league average from 3.  * Wayne Ellington has generated no interest from contending teams in years. Miami threw him to Detroit in 19 for good reason. Below average to poor team defender, bad man defender, extremely streaky shooter, offers nothing else of value.  * Kent Bazemore is your 2nd best guard on the team. Not even injury riddled Golden State last year wanted to play him more than 20 minutes a night. He is an absurdly streaky shooter, most years of his career he's a flat out awful shooter, but will be one of the only players the Lakers can put out late in games because of his defense and plausible ability to make an open 3 32-37% of the time if needed.  * There is one of two Dwight Howards you are going to get for 15 minutes a night. You are either going to get a physical rebounder who comes in and tires out an opposing big man to the tune of 6 fouls per 36 minutes, or you're going to get WWE Superstar Dwight who decides to goon it up, put a team in the bonus, injury someone, or pick up a flagrant foul.  * The Nets paid to get DeAndre Jordan off of a team that had no other center on it.  So you take all of that and try to get a team of a bunch of players who have never played together to suddenly figure out a way to not only do that, but in a way that improves or hides all of their weaknesses.   Not only do they have to figure that out before the playoffs but they also have to somehow stay healthy with a roster that is the oldest in the league on average by a whopping two full years.   The roster is filled with older guys who are absolutely not going to make it a full season without getting injured. Ariza is already out after getting ankle surgery. Ellington is already out with a hamstring that is going to remain a constant issue. Bradley and Rondo are both real injury risks as the season goes on. Plus you have your best or second best player in Anthony Davis being notoriously injury prone and unable to make it through a full season and a LeBron who is clearly slowing down.  So not only do you have this roster that outside of LBJ/AD is pretty god awful when fully healthy, you're going to have to deal with guys getting injured and missing time all year and try to fill their spots with the even worse players behind them.   I assume the Lakers thought that for all the flaws on both ends of the ball that AD and LeBron could either make up for them or diminish them in some way, which maybe they can to some degree, but absolutely not to the point of making this roster good. It is a complete and total dumpster fire and they have absolutely nothing to offer in a trade scenario or cap room to bring on some miracle impact player who would want to head over to LA."
&gt; literally the next day lakers signed him.  He literally fits in with the Lakers age profile perfectly.  Still can't believe the Lakers are spending money on Avery Bradley &amp; DeAndre Jordan...
Homie is calling DeAndre Jordan a hall of famer 😂 maybe hall of kinda good lmao
Bruh ain’t no way DeAndre Jordan is a HOFer
"I know everyone is going to meme this game for different reasons, but man, DeAndre Jordan cannot play any significant minutes. It would be perfect if AD could just play the 5 and Dwight sub him in for 12 min a game. I guess its beating a dead horse at this point but AD at 5 makes both sides of the court so much better for the Lakers."
Tbf that came after watching DeAndre Jordan lumber around the court so he looked pretty great in comparison.
"Much better showing in the 4th, but they played with zero fire until then. They really need to generate more offense that gets Russ barrelling off cuts or something, any possession ending with him shooting a jumper is pretty bad. It's going to take them a while to get it going though, this is very much a work in progress.   But for the love of god stop playing DeAndre Jordan. He is fucking terrible, we're handicapping ourselves to start every game, and it's just wasting what could be 10 productive minutes from someone else. Please don't do what you did with Drummond, it's not worth exploring at all."
Deandre Jordan has the greatest poster of all time.
imagine deandre jordan being the only player shooting over 40% on your team in 2021 lmao
I agree. Mavs must’ve been shocked that we said yes to taking him in the KP trade   ~~The Kristaps Porzingis Trade~~  ~~The Tim Hardaway Jr. Trade~~  ~~The Cap Space Trade~~  The Deandre Jordan Salary Dump
Deandre “not worth a max” ayton with more points rebounds and assists than Anthony Davis/deandre Jordan/Dwight Howard combined
DeAndre Jordan cannot guard a PnR. AD NEEDS to play the 5 and stop fucking playing man. Get your ass to the 5. Jordan should be getting zero minutes.
More like DeAndre Jordan with a +6
I like what I'm seeing besides DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan is literally useless out there
#DEANDRE JORDAN GETTING ALL NBA 1st TEAM IS CHRIS PAULS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT
"He was great last year. Young players have their ups and downs. The team has to give him every shot of turning it around before giving up on him.   Jarrett Allen was so inconsistent his 3rd year. At one point, DeAndre Jordan was outplaying him (and deserved to start over him). Now, he’s a very good center"
&gt; and scoring on lobs and put backs only get you so far  Okay I've been seeing this take all of over this subreddit in this whole top 75 discussion and *did you guys watch Orlando Dwight?* Sure he wasn't Kevin McHale down on the block but he didn't play like fucking DeAndre Jordan.
"I provided you with facts of how little the All NBA really means. I can give you other examples such as DeAndre Jordan being in First Team, or Tony Parker only being 4x All NBA despite being a better player than TMac, or how about Sam Cassell being in Second Team the same season when TMac was also in Second Team. It's honestly quite meaningless when used to consider the impact of a player throughout their career.   If you value TMac being 7x All Star and 7x All NBA while never winning a single playoff series in his career over Reggie's less All Star and All NBA counts despite constantly carrying the team to compete against stronger teams, that's your prerogative. I wouldn't do so because individual performance that actually translates to team's achievement matters more to me to show the impact of a player."
"Deandre Jordan. I didn't hate him particularly, but I knew from the jump that he was diminished and I was worried he was gonna make a stink about Jarrett Allen (at the time on the Nets) playing ahead of him. But even though Jordan wasn't great, he was a great professional and never complained publicly to the media or anything. Both Allen then Nic Claxton said he was great about teaching and working with them and helping them improve."
"The cap space you already have was enough for Randle and Morris. So the cap space you acquired from the trade went to Elfrid payton and Bobby Portis and Wayne Ellington. So was that worth it? No. The picks could be but they haven’t conveyed yet. To be worth it those two picks, likely in the 20-30 range will have to be as good or better than the players lost in KP and THJ.  And saying Randle is a top 20 player is a stretch to everybody that’s not a Knicks fan. All NBA doesn’t determine where a player ranks, it’s influenced by record, injuries and other basketball politics factors. By that logic Deandre Jordan and Ben Simmons and the like were top 15 players when they got the nods"
"- Essentially average is not the same as above average; you’ve changed that.  - Deadlifting strength isn’t relevant to defense; where is that movement relevant at all on defense? How many of your high school and college coaches had you work on deadlift in your strength training / conditioning? Fact is the guy gets pushed around in the post, and cannot alter trajectory of drives. He’s weak.  - Yes he’s gotten bigger. Which is why for the most part we’re looking at draft weights. Under the sssumption that everyone’s mass expands by relatively the same percentage, the discrepancy still exists. So, 180-190; there is no source lists more than that.  - What effort did you want from me? Analogous guards that also suck with the same build? I could sit here for days to list that? The onus is not on me to provide examples; that simply doesn’t make sense.  - Yes I refuted the examples you provided because they are refutable. They don’t have the same physical limitations.  - Charges are a function of how much you’re willing to get hit, which for Lowry — great. If we think defensive positioning is a weakness, well Curry is a 6’3” guard who’s been able to average 8 rebounds a game in a playoff series and just recorded two double digit games, one against a team featuring Deandre Jordan, Anthony Davis, and Dwight Howard.  - What analysis would you like me to do? I’ve said for the most part what is relevant in the body of the post. What research have you really done?  Not 100% sure where you’re coming from. I didn’t think I was taking an antagonistic tone; merely having a discussion, but seems like you’re taking something personally here."
"All Star is about as meaningless as asking random NBA fans.  But All NBA, generally, is pretty solid.  There are exceptions, like you noted, and positional stuff that needs to be considered (DeAndre Jordan has a first team All NBA, while Dame was stuck behind Curry and Harden and sometimes Westbrook).  Reggie's reputation is getting revived by some of the better analysts out there, like Ben Taylor/Backpicks.  It's nice to see even if I don't fully buy it (but he was much better than Mitch Richmond!)."
"I wonder if playing in the primes of top 10 all time guards Harden and Curry had anything to do with that.  Meanwhile, DeAndre Jordan has a All-NBA first team accolade.  Use common sense and context.  Dame has 5 top 10 MVP finishes and 6 All NBA accolades, which is more accomplished than Reggie Miller and Clyde Drexler, among others."
The knicks didn’t win rofl they got DSJ who barely played there and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan. Atleast the Mavs got THJ
Deandre Jordan also had a nba 1st team at center during that time. Seems like tough competition for sure.
Maybe Dwight Howard or Deandre Jordan this year
&gt;what's there to say? it's worse than the 70 whatever % you posted earlier and his made shots were all still wide open dunks  &gt;that's like me calling DeAndre Jordan someone with elite touch when all he does is finish open dunks
"What would you say his offensive ceiling is?  He averaged 19 last year very efficiently, it's not like he's been a DeAndre Jordan type who can't get above 12 because he can't create his own shot  How high can he go?"
"AD was getting 1st team nods a centre in the same era that Joakim Noah and Deandre Jordan made the 1st team.  Paul Pierce was up against Lebron, Durant, Dirk, Duncan and Garnett for a forward spot. I’m not saying AD doesn’t have a case against PP but using 1st team is kind of dumb when AD gets voted is his less preferred position because it was so weak in the 10s."
Yea but what was stoping him from becoming deandre Jordan or Capela? His ego or something ?
👏 MITWestbrook can finally be put to rest about DeAndre Jordan
"As point guard intangibles goes? Sure, CP is absolutely more talented than Curry on this regard. Curry also controls the tempo and playmaking in a elite way, but by performing drastically different plays than what a PG is supposed to do, which makes him unique and it's kinda laughable to see lesser talent like Lillard and Trae trying to mimic that. But the way CP plays is more traditional, that's a huge sample size of pure PGs before Curry arrived with his freakish shooting ability (he is more a combo guard, by far the best combo guard ever). And compared to all of these pure PGs, including Kidd, Nash, Stockton, Thomas, etc.. CP is the most talented between all of them. Magic got really close, but he had the luxury of playing in a super team his entire career (only LeBron had more help than him in NBA history), so I know people love to aggrandize Magic, but we can't never know if he would be the same high productive PG in a ""normal"" team, playing with DeAndre Jordan or Tyson Chandler instead of freaking KAJ, having role players cutting at the basket instead of James Worthy and so on. Chris Paul arrives in any roster, magically (no pun intended) he makes the team better, this is the definition of a elite PG"
"He lucked out and came along as DeAndre Jordan/Dwight Howard were the model of a 5 in the league. Rim Runner/protector, and the Warriors were coming off that We Believe era and Biedrins was their only big along with undersized David Lee"
Deandre Jordan and Avery Bradley
DeAndre Jordan played 4 minutes this game — I think Vogel is finally starting to make adjustments
"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
"So basically, just flop  This doesn’t seem to be the case when guys get dunked on though. Like you’re trying to tell me Brandon Knight impeded of Deandre Jordan? Yeah no way  Refs need to be consistent"
The Deandre Jordan snub. Never forget  Edit: also how long have you had this saved 😂
"Anthony Davis, DeAndre Jordan, and Dwight are the people you want to talk to about that.  To be fair, Holmes used to feast on us in the interior and that's one reason we acquired him."
"Shaq is lost, he said Deandre Jordan."
Yeah it felt completely unfair and I remember it ruined my whole day after seeing the announcement in the morning on the way to work.      He was snubbed for DeAndre Jordan in 2017 but it was his first full All-Star calibre season so it wasn't as bad. 2018 he missed time through injury so it was understandable but then 2019 it just felt completely unjustifiable. It's kinda funny how Rudy won 2 DPOY's before making his first All-Star team.
"AD having a really really bad year, Russ has been getting better lately but was really bad to start the year, I'm not sure if Deandre Jordan can actually play defense if he tried but keeps starting for some reason. Lebron being out is only one of the lakers many problems."
"He contested less 3s than DeAndre Jordan in his ""MVP"" season"
Eddie Johnson is wrong.  The best center combo is DeAndre and Hyland Jordan.
DeAndre Jordan still starts for the Lakers lol
Why the fuck would he fight Deandre Jordan dumbass
So he was willing to run through all his teammates and staff to get to LeBron but not Deandre Jordan?  Yea.....theres a reason for that.
They are Positive +/- with him on the floor without Deandre Jordan
"I want the 3 point and Skills challenge to be comprised solely of centers. Give me Deandre Jordan, Javale McGee and all the other bigs lmao."
"I don't know how long you've been watching but virtually every analyst unanimous agreed Westbrook was lazy on defense. At one point he led the league in uncontested perimeter shots ahead of centers like DeAndre Jordan, who is usually not on the perimeter."
"you cherry picked a specific sample that would make his numbers look better.  if you think TS% on low volume means anything then you probably are one of the smooth brains who think deandre Jordan is a GOAT center, right?"
Bradley is -9.94 on a whopping 327 minute sample size without DeAndre Jordan on the floor. Why does r/nba upvote things without fact checking?   Bradley + DJ is -11 on 140 minutes and it's actually DJ that has -0.67 when Bradley is off the floor.   The Lakers are still garbage without Bradley on the floor: 624 minutes of 2.92 net rating.
"Big facts! He ran all over the place but the direction of Deandre Jordan and also Westbrook. 🤣 lebron should trademark “shoulda, coulda, woulda but didn’t” as a response."
"Why would he fight Deandre Jordan?  “Hold me back” refers to someone pretending to be held back to not fight, not someone throwing 50 staff around. AD was the one going hold me back during that shit"
"You should use a cutoff year. I think of the NBA in three eras. 1946 to 1979, 1979 to 2014, 2015 and after.  It's somewhat arbitrary but my rationale is the first 33 years were dominated by centers, and 99% of the players went strictly with their strong hand.   The 79-80 season was when Magic and Bird entered the league, and ushered in the era of players who played strong with either hand and traditional stereotypical roles evolved based on skillsets. It also represented the first wave of players who could legally dunk in HS and college after it had been banned.  The 2014-15 season unlocked the power of the 3-pointer as a major offensive weapon. Before then, teams might shoot 8 or 9 threes per game by design.  That being my criteria, Russell led era 1, Hakeem led era 2, followed closely by Mutombo and Eaton, and in era 3, I'd call it a tie between DeAndre Jordan and Rudy Gobert."
DeAndre Jordan will hopefully be available
"Yes, he was face to face with Lebron and did nothing.  And if you want to use the ""he needed to process it"" excuse. Ok fine.... watch the video. He trucks through his teammates and coaching staff but then slows to a stop when Deandre Jordan is in front of him.  It was an overly-dramatic ""hold me back"" moment...."
"Yeah the only great players we've missed on in the last 15 years or so are Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, DeAndre Jordan, and Marc Gasol. And the year we passed on Butler is the year we drafted Kawhi."
"lakers young core of dwight howard, deandre jordan, melo and pick swaps of course 🤣"
"Knicks fans are clueless. they still think trading KP and THJ for Deandre Jordan and DSJ was a good deal. all that cap space just to spend it on Fournier, Kemba, and a dude that shot &lt;30% in the playoffs lmaoo"
"That wasn’t really their thing while together in Toronto, but I see what you’re trying to do.   You’re probably better off using DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin even though they already have a name, “Lob City,” from their days with the Clippers."
Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin  Lob City
"I disagree. I think DeAndre Jordan is a good center for the Lakers. Just give him more playing time, I think he'll adapt just fine."
never forget that at the start of the 2020 season this man was backing up DeAndre Jordan
"Sure, but he’s also not setting the team up to be ready for the next level. Even if we will never be in the lottery, we could have still valued the draft and developed assets. Instead, Cuban insists on doing plan powder and not wanting to spend on anyone that isn’t a superstar. Our only “success” was Deandre Jordan and we all saw how that turned out. I just don’t see Cuban making any indication that he’s gonna change his strategy and that’s what’s most frustrating about being a Mavs fan."
"It’s one of the reasons. He has multiple reasons..Being unhappy, unfulfilled, he thought Kyrie Irving and Deandre Jordan could fill his holes, and they did, for a while. He thought he could earn more respects from his peer as the best player in the league unanimously and separated from LeBron and Giannis and Steph, and he did,  after the Bucks series… and now he got what he wants, the Hardest Road with another MVP on his team."
"Kemba got hit by the Mavs free agent curse: he actually wasted time on the mavs pitch. Every 'top' free agent who the mavs went after and didnt ignore the mavs ended up turning into shit. Dwill, whiteside, deandre jordan, etc."
Mcgee has energy and ungodly length on his side. DeAndre Jordan is a man who is very lucky to be tall. I'm not sure what legitimate basketball skills he has.
because they want Deandre Jordan and not Demarcus Cousins
"Less needy with the ball, and although they’re both slow, DeAndre is slightly better offensively   Jordan can go for a lob and Cousins needs a post up to score"
Could've stopped after the first 7 words.  &gt;Why Did the Lakers sign Deandre Jordan?
"Vogel is just doing a solid for his good friend LeBron James, who is doing a solid for his ~~good~~ *unemployed* friend DeAndre Jordan"
"I wonder if its Vogel insisting on playing DeAndre Jordan and the spacing is getting to him. I really think you guys need a stretch 5 like Muscala (he's very good now) or Lopez to pull off that roster. AD seems really hellbent on not playing the 5 in the regular season, so you need a guy who will bang for him down in the post defensively but stretch the offense enough to give ad space to work. Russ has been a good enough shooter to move to the corner now, so its helped a little bit, but I really do feel like DJ is fucking it up for everyone. You can say what you want about russ but that guy is a center whisperer. He made Alex Len look like a starting quality center in Washington. If he cant make DJ look good he's a lost cause."
Wait the lakers most played line up with lebron has Deandre Jordan in it?
Frank Vogel - “DeAndre Jordan is in the Lakers rotation “forever” He said it is “easy to play 5 non-shooters together”
"I read this as ""DeAndre Jordan is out of the Lakers rotation as of right now, Frank Vogel says"""
According to the game logs he's been starting essentially every game as the 4 since DeAndre Jordan has been the 5. But you're right that if it were by minutes played throughout the game it'd be different. I don't know how All-NBA voters determine it
DeAndre Jordan has a top 5 (IN HISTORY) season in DRB%
"I hope the Lakers just play down to the competition because otherwise I’d be worried. A lot of the plays the Pistons legit didn’t even try and defend, and against a team with a real big, DeAndre Jordan won’t be playable like he was tonight."
"Those three bums can’t keep up with all-NBA player, DeAndre Jordan."
"DeAndre Jordan never sniffed 20 ppg in his career, but yeah, i do agree that 20 ppg and 65% TS is a much better stat than the cherry picked EFG% and FT%"
"If it was TS instead of EFG + FT, we would see a few stars in the 20 PPG + 65% TS club. Steph, KD, Deandre Jordan, Amar'e Stoudemire, and Charles Barkley.  An elite efficiency + production club."
Counterpoint: he was earlier and   Deandre Jordan.
"You're putting DeAndre Jordan in that sentence like he isn't the quivalent of a traffic cone on the court💀  LeBron, AD, and Russ part still valid"
They should play Dwight Howard and Deandre Jordan at the same time and have them run the pnr.
"The Nets made more changes than just Deandre Jordan this off-season. There’s a lot of confounding variables for why the Nets defense is better this year. The eye test tells me Deandre Jordan is fine and the Lakers defensive problems persist when he’s off the court, it’s not like the defense magically gets better when he leaves. I haven’t seen that and the Nets stuff may be accurate but he’s also on a different team in a different defensive system."
"Well also they old. Dwight doesn't look like he gives a shit anymore, he doesn't have that fire that he had in his first second stint with the Lakers (y'all know damn well what I'm talking about)   The honest truth is Deandre is ok to start for 4 or so minutes, but the Lakers really need someone who's young athletic and agile, like Jordan Bell to come off the bench to do a lot of the dirty work defensively that LeBron, AD and Melo don't want to do.   The Lakers should also try and get Torey Craig or Garrett Temple onto the team, just to try and fill out that wing."
"Westbrook was great tonight. Looked real comfortable and is cash money from the corner 3, which is wild for me as a Thunder fan lol. Gotta stop playing DeAndre Jordan though, seriously."
"Lakers got outrebounded in both offensive and defensive rebounds. In a game with Anthony Davis, Deandre Jordan, LeBron, Westbrook, the guy with the most rebounds is Cade Cunningham."
"Lakers got outrebounded in both offensive and defensive rebounds. In a game with Anthony Davis, Deandre Jordan, LeBron, Westbrook, the guy with the most rebounds is Cade Cunningham."
Just look at the box score to see Deandre Jordan played 21 fucking minutes LOL
Tune in to the game and the first thing I see is DeAndre Jordan doing some ass move.
"deandre jordan, jakob poeltl who the other one who hasnt taken a 3 pointer this year?"
Why the fuck is Deandre Jordan starting lmfao?
wait is the lakers best center deandre jordan because that's some shit they gotta fix
Lakers should have signed him over Deandre Jordan. He can give you 10 points quickly but gives away 10 even quicker.
"Honestly Lakers should have taken him, probably better than DeAndre Jordan if he played even how he did in the playoffs last season"
That could work lol. CP3 and Javale are vegan and they look great. But on the other hand DeAndre Jordan is vegan too and he still looks old and slow.
More Hartenstein instead of DeAndre Jordan and wings instead of guards and it would’ve been fine.
LeBron should 100% be at the 4 and AD at the 5 full time but Vogel seems deadset on running DeAndre Jordan at the starting 5 spot.
"This is probably just as unbreakable as his MPG record. Just a quick look at a couple of current guys, Andre Drummond and DeAndre Jordan are probably the two worst notable shooters and they’re at ~1700 and ~1900 respectively. Giannis is the worst among high volume shooters and he’s at ~1200.  Nobody is ever touching this, you have to be supremely good at basketball while being exceptionally shit at FTs at the same time to a degree that’s difficult to believe."
"Yes, deandre Jordan should not be getting minutes especially as a starter. Bench him, waive him, trade him whatever. Even Dwight shoots better."
DAJ stands for Deandre Asscheeks Jordan
"What do you mean? It wasn't a good idea to buddy up with Melo, DeAndre Jordan, Russ, Bazemore, Dwight, Ariza, Rondo?"
"Dumb question but can a vet min player get traded? The thought of Deandre Jordan taking a veterans minimum to play and live in LA, but then get traded off to Minnesota or somewhere is hilarious"
You’d love to have him starting over Deandre Jordan or Howard.
Don't believe a single second that a team with DeAndre Jordan as a starting center can do that lol
"Westbrook FG% is 43%, his 3P% is 31%(4 per game) and his FT% is 70%. All those are abysmal for a guard with his volume.  Also Westbrook is 2nd in the League for turnovers per game 0.1 behind Harden.  Arguing that Deandre Jordan is worse than Westbrook with his 14 minutes a game is ""unfair"" to say the least. He is not supposed to move the needle for them, Westbrok is."
"Targeting one player for a whole team's struggles is the epitome of "" lack of team culture "" and rarely, if ever leads to success. You could easily make a similar play by play for Westbrook in 75% of his matches this year and yet you don't, why is that?  If you ask me, someone that plays 10-15 minutes on a minimum contract has far less weight compared to someone who plays 35-40 on a Supermax. Westbrook have lost far more games for the Lakers than Deandre Jordan.  What I said, it doesn't mean that DJ isn't mediocre/bad but more so borderlines your very heavy bias towards ""anyone but Westbrook"" fault.  If you want to be so nit picky, answer me this - Westbrook has abysmal shooting %'s, mediocre to bad assist/turnover ratio and he is an abysmal defender. Should he be in the League with those things in mind? Can Lakers be anything than a First round exit with him in the line up?  Nothing wrong to be a fan of Russ but the way you throw his teammates under the buss while he is often worse than them ... it's comical :)"
Doc Rivers basically made DeAndre's entire career.  He went from being a poor man's Hassan Whiteside that Vinny Del Negro refused to play in 4th quarters to a serviceable defensive 5 that did fairly well within the limited role he was given.  He was never actually elite on defense but enough people bought into the Doc Rivers hype and rebounding stats that he got accolades and a very questionable All Star appearance.  Prime DeAndre Jordan was basically like a version of Drummond that rarely if ever tried to play outside of his role.  His game was never going to age well as long as his offensive skills were limited and he had to rely heavily on having super elite athleticism.  He started to check out mentally towards the end of his Clippers tenure and has basically been a negative asset for every other team he's joined.  You might five or six games a season in which he's willing to hustle and make the requisite effort on defense.
"Imagine someone told you a team with Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Melo, Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Rondo, Trevor Ariza and Avery Bradley lost to the Kings"
"He had to switch onto guards on the perimeter over and over because of the lack of wing D which makes it harder to cover the perimeter, then bomb back into the paint for rebounding.   Lakers rebounding was pathetic tonight though, Kings got too many offensive rebounds. Deandre Jordan can barely hold onto the ball."
"it’s harder and harder to find reasons to keep Vogel as head coach. continues to play Deandre Jordan real minutes, there’s absolutely no offensive game plan, there seems to be no plays drawn up in timeouts, and there’s no defense being played.  firing a coach is a big deal, but he’s either not doing a good job at all, or the team has tuned hi. out which is a bigger issue altogether.  i don’t want Fizdale as the coach of this team, but the same issues happen each and every game and it’s not something that can just be deflected with “injuries” as the reasoning.  this roster has its issues, but it’s also not having its potential maximised. clearly there wasn’t an offense implemented in the off-season."
deandre jordan having 11 minutes is the real issue lol
DeAndre Jordan... Has 1 rebound in 11 minutes. 1.
Put Deandre Jordan in to help rebounding
Starting deandre jordan in 3rd quarters is like blatantly trying to throw games
Breaking news! Lakers trade Russ for KAT. Vogel has announced DeAndre Jordan will be the starter for the remainder of the season.
"DeAndre Jordan must have naked pics of Vogel, that’s the only explanation I see."
I find it hard to believe there isn't a g league center that could play better than DeAndre Jordan
Deandre Jordan wouldn't even get minutes in the Big 3
DeAndre Jordan for Michael Jordan who says no?
Them trotting out deandre Jordan at starting center when he shouldn’t ever see meaningful minutes also makes it hard to build a good defense around. They don’t have a lot of good versatile wing defenders either.
DeAndre Jordan
"Because there are a whole bunch of morons out there convinced that he's a DeAndre Ayton-level player without a shred of evidence to back it up. I'm not saying that all Wiseman supporters are unrealistic (I didn't like what I saw from him during year one, but the same goes for Jordan Poole and look at him now), but the guy definitely has his share of unreasonable stans, especially over on /r/warriors."
DeAndre Jordan. Not even close.
There’s gotta be a better center than DeAndre Jordan that averages less than 10 points right?
"DeAndre Jordan, THT, and Nets pick"
"Avery Bradley, Kilian Hayes or Deandre Jordan"
DeAndre Jordan
"KD fucked up leaving GS to play with Kyrie. He really left a team where he had it all because nephews were mad he joined a good team and cyber bullied him. By now, people wouldn’t care as much.   Next season it would be Steph, Klay, KD, Green, Wiseman plus whoever they draft with Wolves first round pick. Now he’s with Kanye Irving and DeAndre Jordan."
I'm not saying they're the elite of the elite as rebounders but they're a lot better than you make them sound using career averages.  Kleber and Porzingis in the present are better rebounders than their career averages indicate. Kleber wasn't even a real NBA player when he came into the league in his mid 20s. Not to mention that we had DeAndre Jordan in Dallas who jealously made sure other players left easier rebounds to him. Porzingis developed into a real 20/10 player in his first season in Dallas despite spending half the season having trouble finding his rhythm before his stats exploded in February 2020.
MVP probably DRose. Will probably be the only MVP to never make it to the Hall. Worst All Nba First teamer is DeAndre Jordan by far unless i'm forgetting someone
Depends entirely on who you're referring to. Kyrie Irving vs DeAndre Jordan vs Lebron James all have a different answer.
"Especially the ""he was so big he *had* to stay out of shape b/c getting in shape would have injured him"" crowd.  When he first came into the league he wasn't dramatically bigger than Ewing or Mourning, for example.  If he stayed at that size - or gone back to it - his decline from ""past his prime but still good"" to ""slow oaf who looks like he's made of concrete"" would have gone a lot slower.  Remember how Duncan looked washed up in 2011 against the Grizzlies when Zack Randolph pretty much had his way with him and then he lost like 25 lbs combined over the next two offseasons and looked like a better player at age 39 than he'd been at age 35? And inded up holding his own against DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin in 2015?  Or how Malone and Barkley were basically each about as good as the other in the early-mid 90s and then Barkley turned into a spare much quicker while Malone was still a high-quality post defender at age 40? Because Malone took his conditioning seriously and Barkley didn't.  Compared to Malone, Barkley was out of shape. Obviously he's not out of shape for a rec league, but he wasn't getting paid to play in a rec league."
"That squad is a first round exit. That’s why. DeAndre Jordan, who looks like a shell of himself as a player, definitely doesn’t convince you to stick around."
DeAndre Jordan has been washed for at least three seasons
"&gt;Your point was Duncan isn't as great as people say because he had an All-Star guard?   You're much dumber than I thought, if that's what you think.  Duncan had multiple likely-Hall-ofFame and All-star teammates, plus one of the best centers ever.  That not ""an All-star guard"".  &gt;So did Shaq, he had two top 10 if not top 5 SGs of all time during his prime. Kareem had the best PG of all time to play with in LA. Were they not great?  O'Neal threepeated with a roster whose third-best player was... Derek Fisher?  Duncan never did anything like that.  Kareem won a title with an expansion team, composed of Oscar Robertson in his final effective season, and the remainder of which was rookies and sophomores.  Not only did he win, they completely dominated all comers.  Duncan never did anything like that.  So, yes, they were great, and Duncan was not.  They were both also vastly more efficient scorers than Duncan, to the degree that there's no comparison at all, at that end of the floor.  &gt;Your point was Duncan played more minutes because he had Robinson to play with?  Are you genuinely this stupid, or is this an act?  Of course it's easier to play at forward against smaller, weaker competition and with an all-time great center to cover for you, and help rebound.  &gt;Wrong about what? You're argument is Rik Smits is on par with Duncan because he shot close to his career FG%? Again, I guess that means DeAndre Jordan, Gobert, and Tyson Chandler are above Duncan because they were All-Star big men who had a better FG%  Which means, like I originally said, Duncan was very unremarkable offensively.  And wasn't great defensively, either.  Add it up, and maybe you will start to understand my point.  &gt;You're gonna say Duncan only scored over 20ppg because he had an old injured Robinson to distract the defense, but are also saying Pau's a better scorer than Duncan despite never scoring over 19ppg playing with prime Kobe?  This doesn't even make any sense.  Read your comments over before hitting he button.  First of all, it's very difficult for anyone to score when playing with Bryant, because he passes only under duress.  If you knew thing-one about basketball, you would know this.  Second, Gasol repeatedly averaged similar numbers to Duncan's post-Robinson years while playing on completely unmanned Memphis teams -- without the multiple All-stars Duncan was lucky enough to play with.  Again, if you knew thing-one about the topic at hand, I wouldn't need to explain this to you.  &gt;Howard was nowhere near the scorer Duncan was, again Howard was a low offensive usage high efficiency scorer but was never elite on offense like Duncan was.  You have to be trolling.  Duncan was never elite offensively, as the above comparison to damn near every All-star big of that period shows.  And Howard averaged just as many points as Duncan.  &gt;Oh, you're switching to eFG now when you were using regular FG% before got it.   I've been using eFG% all along.  Again, if you knew thing-one, you'd have realized that.  &gt;Since you don't think he's as good as people say, where do you rank him? Who do you have over him that everybody else doesn't?  Depends on the scope.  Are you talking ""forwards"", bigs, or all players?"
DeAndre Jordan is his cheerful self.
"&gt; Parker was not more efficient than Duncan. Guess it was lucky for Duncan that he had All-star guards to lean on -- wait, wasn't that my original point? Sure enough it was.  Your point was Duncan isn't as great as people say because he had an All-Star guard? So did Shaq, he had two top 10 if not top 5 SGs of all time during his prime. Kareem had the best PG of all time to play with in LA. Were they not great?   &gt; Too bad he didn't have Robinson around to make those minutes easier. Wait a minute, damn, that was my original point again wasn't it?  Your point was Duncan played more minutes because he had Robinson to play with?   &gt; You said ""Any All-star big from that era"". If you want to retract your offer, it's too late. Think and/or research first next time, if you don't want to be wrong.  Wrong about what? You're argument is Rik Smits is on par with Duncan because he shot close to his career FG%? Again, I guess that means DeAndre Jordan, Gobert, and Tyson Chandler are above Duncan because they were All-Star big men who had a better FG%  &gt; Duncan did that just twice without David Robinson distracting the defense -- and only just barely. So yes, Gasol actually was at least the scorer that Duncan was, and in fact, was better.  You're gonna say Duncan only scored over 20ppg because he had an old injured Robinson to distract the defense, but are also saying Pau's a better scorer than Duncan despite never scoring over 19ppg playing with prime Kobe?   &gt; The only thing Duncan has on Howard is longevity and much better teammates. Howard was far better defensively, and scored as much, on better efficiency throughout his twenties. Howard did not sustain that in this thirties, but he's no contest the better player in his twenties. Howard -- like Robinson and Leonard -- anchored a top-rated defense, and did so with mediocre-at-best teammates. Something Duncan never managed.  &gt; That said, you're off on some tangent here. We were discussing how inefficient Duncan was offensively  Howard has a really good 4 year run, his peak never touched Duncan's MVP seasons though. Howard was nowhere near the scorer Duncan was, again Howard was a low offensive usage high efficiency scorer but was never elite on offense like Duncan was.   &gt; You'll have to acquire a familiarity with numbers if you wish to continue here. Duncan's career effective FG% was .507, and Nowitzki's was .512. 512 is larger than 507, you'll be surprised to learn.  Oh, you're switching to eFG now when you were using regular FG% before got it. Yes, the .05 % in eFG makes up for the huge gap in rebounding and defense Duncan has over Dirk  &gt; No, I just pay more attention.  Yes, I'm sure you're more adept to gauge how good of a player Duncan was than the people who actually played against him... 🤦🏽‍♂️ Since you don't think he's as good as people say, where do you rank him? Who do you have over him that everybody else doesn't?"
"&gt; Or couldn't get quality shots against more attention. I suppose you probably believe he just stopped shooting as much to avoid embarrassing the opposition or something, but I sincerely doubt that.  What kind of dumb ass strawman argument is that? No, he took less shot because Tony Parker became a much bigger part of the offense, no teammate since Robinson in Duncan's rookie year took more shot than Parker did from 03-04 onward. Plus Pop really started managing his minutes, he never played less than 39 minutes a game before 03/04 after he never played more than 35. Less minutes plus deferring to other players is why his shots went down.  &gt; Any big? Are you sure about that? You might want to retract that offer in a minute.  &gt; How about O'Neal and his career .582? Left him off your list, didya? Or Robinson, and his .519? Or Dwight Howard and his .565? Or Amar'e Stoudemire and his .538? Or Alonzo Mourning and his .529? Or Karl Malone and his .516? Or Olajuwon and his .513? Or Pau Gasol and his .513? Or Rik Smits and his .507? &gt;  &gt; And for that matter, during the few seasons in Boston when Garnett had something resembling Duncan's supporting cast, he shot 53-54% despite being in his mid-thirties by then. Nowitzki was also more efficient than Duncan despite substantially more volume and attention. &gt;  So, Duncan was more efficient than Chris Webber and matched Rik Smits. Wow, I am whelmed. Is that all you've got?  Shaq is the most dominate low post scorer and efficient low post big man ever, not gonna argue that. Rik Smits really? Might as well say Gobert, DeAndre Jordan, Tyson Chandler and Hassan Whiteside are better than Duncan because their FG% is in the 60s. Robinson, Malone, and Olajuwon were an era before Duncan, I was comparing him to his contemporaries. Garnett's efficiency went up in Boston because his usage went way down, notice as his ppg and shots per game went down his efficiency went up. Pau was never the scorer Duncan was, Pau topped 20 ppg only twice in his career, Duncan did it nine times. If you want to argue at Dwight's 4 year peak in Orlando from 08-12 he was better than Duncan at the same time I won't argue that, Duncan was 32 and 11 years deep into his career. He peak doesn't match Duncan's peak though and outside of those peak Orlando years, Dwight doesn't even come close to comparing to Duncan. Dirk wasn't more efficient than Duncan, Dirk shot over 50% twice in his career. Even if you take into account 3 point shooting and free throws, that doesn't close the gap on how much better Duncan was as a rebounder and defender.    &gt; Almost every seven foot professional basketball player suffers back pain.  Yeah, and once it becomes a chronic issue, they start to become a shell of their former selves &gt;  &gt; Weren't you just saying he was never the same after an injury at 23? And how his unremarkable results without All-Star teammates should be ignored, because he was over-the-hill at 32 by then?  He was never the same athletically after 23, so in that sense we never got to see his skill combined with his peak athleticism, that's a scary thought actually now that I think about it. Wouldn't say unremarkable, but yeah eleven years into an NBA career, most players aren't the same as they were at their peak, especially big men.   &gt; I watched him play, and he wasn't that great. Again, we've plenty of numbers to support that. He was exceedingly lucky to be drafted by a team that won 60 games repeatedly without him, and who reloaded with a number of All-Stars during his career. Otherwise, he'd have nowhere near the undeserved reputation he has.  Then you must be watching something completely different than literally every other fan, sports analyst, and player who played against him and said how great he was. 🤷🏽‍♂️"
That’s correct. It wouldn’t make sense if we call Deandre Jordan the most efficient in the clutch if he has 12 buckets
It’s actually Deandre Jordan
Nets can be straight up terrible at times.   Like everyone standing around with their backs turned while the guy with the ball runs behind them unguarded for a wide open layup.    Idk how much of that has to do with a Zone Defense and too much switching so a player always gets lost vs effort.   It’s amazing how much DeAndre Jordan has fallen off at 32yrs old. It’s like once he joined the Nets he forgot how to play basketball. Dude just walks around on the court with no hustle when he could easily get 8pts 8reb with a decent Def effort off the bench.    Once Kyrie and KD got Jordan that $ he’s just coasting. I just get disappointed like a parent instead of angry like at fan over it by this point.    Still have another 2yrs left of DeAndre. Maybe 1yr since if Durant opts out next offseason Nets have no reason to keep DeAndre on a expiring $10m contract when he can be added to a trade for $.
"I see where you’re coming from, but that’d just result in Deandre Jordan caliber FT shooters getting hacked every possession."
The Nets will also only get better once Nash stops playing DeAndre Jordan so many minutes and Dinwiddie comes back healthy.
"he’s 4th on the all time true shooting list behind deandre jordan, cedric maxwell, and tyson chandler. obviously the first one to take any threes though. for fun, KAT is 6th and reggie miller is 10th"
"He led the league in uncontested perimeter shots at one point, contesting less than Deandre Jordan who sits in the paint lmao"
How Wiseman look more skilled his first four games than he next four? Kerr succeeding in turning him into DeAndre Jordan.
"Deandre jordan fucking blows. he just dunks good, hes basically tacko fall"
that was a hilarious travel from Deandre Jordan
Lowry for LeVert and DeAndre? I know Jordan is washed but he'd probably start for us at this rate :(
Yesterday they called deandre Jordan Taurean Prince.
"Not so much the attributes but those attributes being misattributed to certain players. For example, Curry often plays off ball, Giannis isnt a shot-blocking center, and Harden is crafty + actually passes. But if youve seen only highlights, you'd think Curry just dribbles around the halfcourt pulling up from 3, Giannis is just Deandre Jordan with a eurostep, and Harden is a brainless ball hog."
Except in allnba. Thats why DeAndre Jordan has 3 AllNba selections to Kyle Lowrys 1.
DeAndre Jordan is hyper efficient because all he does on the scoring front is catch lobs and throw down put backs. Ask him to do anything else and you’d be looking at a ton of hook shot bricks and turnovers because he isn’t a skilled scorer in any sense of the term. His strengths lie in throwing down lobs and putbacks and rebounding.
Marv also kept calling DeAndre Jordan Taurean Prince

Tristan Thompson and DeAndre Jordan too
"it wasn’t just the names, he legitimately confused their entire careers.  fucking marv albert mistook DeAndre Jordan for Prince at one point too lmfaoo"
"If DeAndre Jordan is not 7ft, then Dirk."
Can't help but notice Nash letting Jarrett Allen start over DeAndre Jordan the second Kyrie and KD are gone
"Okay I’ve been playing a game on my computer and have been watching listening in the background, Chris Webber calls prince, demarre Carroll you have Marv Albert not able to go to a commercial break and the station has to interrupt him, marv calling Jarrett Allen Deandre Jordan when he’s not even on the floor, what’s going on at Turner?"
Some Albert/Webber to English translations:  Chris Chiozza = Landry Shamet  Tyrese Maxey = Shake Milton  Taurean Prince = Deandre Jordan
Is Marv having a stroke. He called chiozza shamet and deandre Jordan prince. Retire old man
Marv is hilarious. Taurean Prince looks a lot like DeAndre Jordan wow
"These are tumultuous times, he's probably protesting the fact that DeAndre Jordan is coming off the bench now."
DeAndre Jordan 40/19/2 Nets win by 7
"For anyone wondering, I haven't really seen this upvoted. He took a big shot from DeAndre Jordan during the Nets game and hasn't really been the same lately. It was a concussion but he is still playing. Hope he gets it together soon, its becoming a little worrying. His decision making is a little loopy ever since that shot to the head."
Been hearing that he has had a concussion from 3 games ago. Makes sense because they sat him almost all 3rd and half of 4th. Worrisome at best. He hasn't really been looking all there and its a little concerning. It was from DeAndre Jordan to the head.
Kerr is hell bent on turning Wiseman into Deandre Jordan
fuck deandre jordan
"No but on a serious note, there is talk in our sub. There was a play against the nets where Deandre Jordan got him in the head pretty bad. We honestly think it could have threw him off if not a slight concussion, hasn’t been the same since. Before that moment was playing at very very least top 8 players. Was also hustling on defense but now he’s getting 8 second violations, turnovers, and a fucking inbound turnover today? Something isn’t right"
No it’s really been since the first Nets game. Got kneed in the head by DeAndre Jordan accidentally. Could have an undiagnosed concussion
Trae just doesn't look right since he took a knee to the head from Deandre Jordan.
"$8m isn't too bad a solid backup big who can give you some 20mins a night, Plumlee isn't the worst signing in a vacuum. I mean he is certainly better than DeAndre Jordan who Nets fans are already clamoring to be benched in favor of Jarrett Allen  The trouble is the Pistons decided they didn't want to pay Christian Wood, who might be a fringe all-star player, just a little bit more. Essentially it makes them look as if they picked the cheaper, worse option"
"Boogie made second team.. Deandre Jordan made first team in 2016... kinda mind boggling but that’s just rewarding winners I guess.  I agree Deandre Jordan was a good player. But by no mean was he a strong All NBA 1st team player. Prime Deandre Jordan wouldn’t even be the 5th best center in today league, given he’d be less impactful than Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Gobert, Sabonis, Bam"
"Prime Deandre Jordan wouldn’t even be top 5 Centers in current league today  He would be less impactful than Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Bam, Sabonis, Gobert  I’d throw Nurkic in there too but Nurk been playing really bad.  Prime Deandre Jordan was more or less the bigger stronger Clint Capela  By far Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond are the worst All NBA selections in recent memory.. simply due to the fact that league was lacking hard at talented centers during those years"
"Yeah very media savvy answer. Pretty impressive for somebody coming off such a big performance to be humble and smart enough to dodge the bait, especially when it's pretty obvious he's better than DeAndre Jordan right now."
how the hell is this guy not starting ahead of DeAndre Jordan
"Andre Drummond, deandre Jordan type of can’t shoot can rebound"
Drummond thinks he’s Kobe when’s he’s actually Deandre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan. Please.
"by the 1:22 mark in the first quarter, the jazz were down 31-9, so by normal standards, there wasn't much to watch for, at least for the outcome of the game. and yet, the last 36 minutes of this game were some of the most fun garbage time I've seen in a while.  with Dinwiddie out of the rotation and Durant benched for covid protocol, suddenly a ton more shots were available across the board, and the biggest recipients of all these extra buckets were primarily LeVert and Allen. today, Allen made his first start under the new nets roster and certainly submitted his resume to start for at least until durant returns to the starting lineup with a spectacular 18/19/3s/2b performance and phenomenal play against gobert, easily one of his best performances of his career.   Allen isn't really a guy who can put the ball on the floor and create his own shot so a lot of his points will come from screening actions or garbage men duties, but tonight he showed some [pretty great touch around the rim](https://youtu.be/qo_IbBchV2E) with some drives and hooks directly into the chest of gobert, and a good extra pass to TLC (a fantastically underrated off-ball cutter) on a short roll in the second quarter.   Now, again, while there's really no question on who's the better: Allen or Jordan, there's at least *an* argument that LeVert/Allen is a solid dynamic duo of the bench which gives LeVert the a way better option then Deandre to run screening actions in bench dominant lineups, and Allen could probably be a bigger point of the offense if he doesn't constantly need to defer shot opportunities to two other stars. with only Kyrie though, there's no such bottleneck and the case for him to start becomes a obvious one.   aside from Allen, as this was a complete team win from the Nets: Kyrie was Kyrie, Joe Harris killed it yesterday in minutes off the bench and continues to show all around improvement to go from ""just a shooter"" to a more J.J. Redick type, TLC was a firm net positive in his minutes played and even Tyler Johnson made consistent positive contribution. Hell even Deandre had highlights that weren't lob related.  LeVert's rise to one of the strongest 6MOY candidates has been a fantastic development for his career because he now plays into the paradox that there's almost no one off the bench who can consistently stifle him when they play the Nets, because if they were a good enough perimeter defender to do so, they'd probably already start, which speaks to the different scalabilities off 1v1 instant offense and 1v1 defense.  Kenny Atkinson was pivotal for laying the foundations for this Nets team and under him, the Nets were perennial overachievers on the defensive end, with the cost of their offense being a bit stale and prone to seeking too many mediocre 3 point attempts, though those Nets teams certainly didn't have the same caliber of offense on their roster. However between Jacque Vaughn/MDA/Nash the offense just flows so much better across the board, and the defense hasn't tanked yet. I feel this teams defensive woes are probably overrated, although I wouldn't jump the gun on calling them ""good"" until their starting center situation is resolved."
DeAndre Jordan might actually be the worst player in the league at this point and he’s still averaging like 18mpg
"gobert is not your typical bruising center. Jokic and embiid are two of the only ones left in the game. Id say vucevic and nurkic are also pretty good at it. Embiid has given allen a lot of trouble in the past, if he can hold his own against him it'd signal a huge improvement in his game. I do think we'll be seeing a fair amount of deandre jordan against him tho and i think it would be smart to throw out DJ for a good amount of time against him. Allen will likely get in foul trouble if he has to guard embiid for a long period of time."
DeAndre Jordan
Because deandre Jordan is friends with kyrie and kd. Which is the dumbest shit ever
Hope DeAndre Jordan gets on foul trouble every fucking game from now on.
I was more reading it as prime Jordan and like would you have given prime Deandre a max?
Petition to start Jarrett Allen over Deandre Jordan
File this game for evidence on why Jarrett Allen should start over Deandre Jordan
Theres really no reason to start DeAndre Jordan above Jarrett Allen going forward
The statement literally no human being other then Deandre Jordan is surprised about.
nets better give this man the bag because in 3 years deandre jordan will have completely turned into stone
I cannot believe DeAndre Jordan was starting over this man
The worst thing for the Jazz in this game was Deandre Jordan being in foul trouble. Jarret Allen is so much better than him.
yea after this game we better not see deandre jordan starting over Jarrett allen anymore lmao
K but DeAndre Jordan has more allnba selections than Kyle Lowry...
deandre jordan if you're gonna go way fucking under a screen you could at least box someone out
DeAndre Jordan starts
"Yeah im pretty split on guys like JV and whiteside. I think Nurk and Deandre Jordan fit in that group as well. To a certain extent, being huge and parking yourself in front of the rim is all it takes sometimes"
"Oh Siakam played next to Ibaka and Gasol.. it’s like he’s a PF and those other guys are centers.. wow such sharp observation!   Now you really got me thinking about Blake Griffin playing next to Deandre Jordan or Andre Drummond, and how losing both front court partners that provide so much really really turned Blake into a shell of himself.. but wait that is not how it is at all!  Or unless you’re saying Ibaka and Gasol are actually the Pascal whisper and that he can’t hit open shots without them?"
Why isn’t this more upvoted? This shit is ridiculous. Gave me deandre jordan murdering brandon knight vibes with the angle and coming down the lane
Such random beef. I like Shaq but he acts like a dick a lot of the time. Who will he feud with next? Will he call out DeAndre Jordan for not being as good as Shaq was at that age? Maybe we'll see an anti Gobert diss track
"Thats so weird y'all have Jarrett Allen, DeAndre Jordan, and Kevin Durant. How is post defense and rebounding the issue? I havent been able to see many of yalls games but I feel like those three by themselves have a solid history and reputation of good rim protection and rebounding. Have they regressed in those categories? Or low effort? Either way yall can still pull it together. You have Kyrie and KD that alone will get you in the playoffs. What you do from there is up to them."
This next to Chris Paul jumping at Deandre Jordan to put the ball back at the buzzer
"Shaq was a monster on court taking every advantage of his size, but once his body stops listening to him, he's just a big Fatman who can't jump.  Then I realized his game is more reactionary with his body's blessing.  Similar to DeAndre Jordan.  The one key thing I'm seeing with Rudy is how incredible his defensive player IQ.  He may not have Shaq's body size and speed, but man can he predict how and where the offensive player moves.  He place his hands like he knows where the player is going with it.  Using his IQ instead of athleticism will benefit him as a reliable player long term (he has to, those early injuries cost him and his team time).  If Utah didn't max it, I have a feeling few other teams would court him heavily to beef up defensive capabilities (shit, as a Clipper fan, I'd dump Paul George for Rudy)."
"&gt; Mitchell and Gobert aren't bringing a title to Utah. Their salaries will also make sure they can't bring in another great player to help them be true contenders.   Right, because all the big FAs are just dying to play in Utah...   What FA Utah can get that's going to win them a title? They couldn't even keep Gordon Hayward. Their biggest signings ever are Carlos Boozer, Bojan and Mike Conley. They're not in LA where Lebron and Shaq will just fall into their lap, and Kobe and AD will force their way there.   Even if you draft a superstar player, they can just leave without winning. The list of All-NBA players from the last 5 seasons, who left their original team without winning includes: Lebron, AD, CP3, KD, Russ, Harden, Butler, PG13, Blake, LMA, Love, DeRozan, Kemba, Oladipo, Wall, DeAndre Jordan, IT2, DMC, Lowry, Drummond, and the Gasol brothers.   The only All-NBAers from the last 5 seasons who've won titles with their original teams before leaving are: Steph, Klay, Draymond, Kyrie, Duncan and Kawhi.   I mean, think about it - you can draft the arguable GOAT like the Cavs did, and still end up with as many rings before he leaves as Mitchell/Gobert have won so far in Utah."
How quick people forget about Deandre Jordan.
"I'd still put KD, Giannis, AD, Javale and DeAndre Jordan comfortably over Wiseman at this point, but he has the potential to grow."
"Chris Paul, John Wall, Isaiah Thomas (even tho he was a nugget for a second), DeAndre Jordan  The lob city clippers were so fun to watch (and DJ is such a wholesome dude), the Isaiah Thomas Celtics were another one of my favorite teams outside Denver, and John Wall was such a fuckin beast on the wizards and I'm excited that he's playing again"
"Thats ridiculous for a big, Deandre Jordan is the all time leader in career 2 point percentage with 67.11% and brown is just barely above that mark, absolutely insane stretch to start the season"
FUCK DEANDRE JORDAN HARD AND PASSIONATELY
I’ve been a Nets fan since I was a kid in the early 90’s.   These Nets are bad. They don’t Defend or Rebound. Their Offense isn’t good enough to make up for that on a consistent basis.   Nash has been a complete Dud so far at HC. It’s just Jason Kidd all over again in the exact same situation talent wise.   Atkinson got the Nets to Over Perform with shitty rosters that Marks was constantly making worse by trading players for assets. Nash hasn’t shown any Offensive or Defensive Talent and the Nets don’t need a “Development” type coach when they just fired Atkinson who was a better version of that.   Nets don’t even have an Offensive game plan. This is what they do.   One guy dribbles the ball while 4 others stand around. They don’t run plays or have any ball movement like when Atkinson was the coach. It’s just Iso while 4 guys stand around Clueless.   When LeVert enters its even worse because it seems liked Nets gave him the green light to dribble the air out of the ball before going 1vs5 in the paint chucking up a bad shot.    How about the Nets run a Motion Offense or any kind of Offense.    Then you got the Culture Killers who are the main culprits when it comes to the lack of Offense being initiated. Kyrie and Durant are also why the Nets are burning $10m a year on a washed up Vet Min player in DeAndre Jordan.   Then again Sean Marks is allergic to Power Forwards. He prefers Skinny SF’s who get molested like alter boys in the paint.
"LeBron hasn't been the best player in the league since 2005 man come on. It was around 2010-2012 that he finally became the best in the league. Accolades absolutely display a player's accomplishments. They're flawed, but definitely contribute to a player's legacy in a big way. It's why you can look at hardens 2018 Vs beals 2020 and deem one season significantly better than the other(just one example that comes to mind, there are better examples out there of similar stat lines but the accolade is what gives the context of how the person's performance was perceived).  PG defense is less important because 1. You're never going to stop the best guards from scoring. Whether you put Kyrie or cp3 on curry he's giving you 30+ on similar efficiency. Additionally, if a guard shoots a contested 3 from 30 feet your defense doesn't really fall apart. That was still a bad shot and the defense doesn't adjust to deny that shot. However, if a center is feasting or even has a mismatch in the post the probability of that possession translating to a bucket is extremely high, so you have to change your scheme by sending a double team or subbing in a big man that's better suited to guarding the other teams center. Also, if you have a good defensive big man as an anchor your defense as a whole can focus more on the perimeter because the paint is locked down. One guy can lock down a crucial area of the court which translates to a good defensive team. Your example of bogut being an elite defender fits this perfectly.  8 points is the difference between Damian Lillard and Andrew Wiggins last season. Sure, assists are great and cp3s passing and vision is better than currys, but their seasons were incredibly different. Cp3 had a great season in that MVP level year but curry was other-worldly. Cp3 shot 50/36/87 in 09, which is fantastic, but Steph shot 50/45/90 on 4 more shot attempts, along with of course shooting from half court and shooting a ridiculous amount of full court heaves. Curry also did this in 4 minutes less than cp3, which is substantial over the course of a full season. Also, as much of a copout as it feels like to bring up intangibles, the playstyle of curry and cp3 is drastically different on offense. Curry played far more off ball than cp3 in their respective seasons and obviously drew a ton of double teams, so while he did average less assists than Chris, I assume the amount of open looks and easy baskets he generated(and still generates) outweigh the amount that cp3 generated. This point is admittedly down to opinion though, as there's nothing that measures this stat.  By the way, of course cp3s teammates have never been as good as curry had from 2017-2019, but let's not act like Blake, deandre Jordan, harden were bums. If anything, Currys ppg would lower, like they did, by playing next to more stars, and his assists would lower too due to playing off ball more. Cp3 was definitely playing with bums in New Orleans though."
For a moment I thought Michael Jordan instead of Deandre. Presti spoiled me bad.
"Lmfao yeah dude please keep telling yourself that, there’s not one person on this planet who’s going to do anything but laugh in your face if you say Dwight Howard in 2013 with LAL then 2014 with Houston was better than Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Jamal, Lou Will, and Reddick in their prime   Zero nba knowledge you hate to see it"
"Lmfao you think the Dwight Howard Harden played with was anywhere close to his hall of fame or even all-star form? Bro you clearly don't know what you are talking about, Dwight was so washed by then the Lakers fans are still angry they even signed him before his Houston stint, Westbrook was also below par when he was in Houston, check the numbers, that's why nobody was trying to deal for him, and CP3? Literally the only time he got to the conf finals was with Harden, where he then got hurt as they were about to move on  You can't make the case CP3 is a winner because he hasn't won, even with more talent than other guys, those Clippers teams unseated Kobe and the Lakers as the best team in LA for years, he had Blake, DeAndre Jordan and Jamal Crawford and Lou Will, those Clippers teams were deep and talented and always picked to contend  Please do yourself a favor and research your opinions bro lmao you clearly don't know what you're talking about"
Long clip Deandre Jordan
lol jarrett allen has been better than deandre jordan. the move the need to make is playing him more
FUCK DEANDRE JORDAN
Whoever thought that he was deserved to be spanked and put on time out. Jan vesley just felt like a shit verison of deandre jordan.
Cuban is beside himself. Driving around downtown Brooklyn begging (thru texts) Jordan's family for address to DeAndre's home so he can fuck DeAndre Jordan.
DeAndre Jordan is a starter?  I thought they were supposed to be a title contender?
deandre jordan was at one point a draft pick
FUCK DEANDRE JORDAN
All my homies fuck Deandre Jordan.
Looks like Deandre Jordan lost a few steps too.
&gt; FUCK DEANDRE JORDAN
"Yeah, but we still have DeAndre Jordan. That kinda cancels everything out."
One washed DeAndre Jordan as your only real center and no Kevin Durant.
Harden and DeAndre Jordan? 😂
"Well there's also the fact that DeAndre Jordan is one of the worst players in the league, so..."
This Nets team will continue to struggle against teams with decent bigs unless one or two happens.   They go small ball like Houston did last year or they find another big to play with Deandre Jordan
Deandre Jordan has been the least valuable player in the NBA this year. Absolutely useless
The best defensive coach cannot turn Kyrie and DeAndre Jordan into good defenders
They have DeAndre Jordan except now he's called DeAndre Bowie
"I'm no coach but isn't this the key to beating the Nets? Play in the paint back down DeAndre Jordan, hope to get him in foul trouble early... Seems almost too easy especially with the Cavs depth at C and PF."
But-but t-they have deandre jordan??
DeAndre Jordan would just start over him anyways.
Hello. I just woke up from a 6 year coma. Sounds like they should trade for Deandre Jordan.
Serious question what are the nets gonna do for a paint presence?  Don’t say deandre Jordan either
Zubac was one of the better rim protectors in the league last year. Nets have a washed up DeAndre Jordan and Jeff Green as center
Nets were looking like they would make ECF minimum this year before the Harden trade. Levert off the bench was unfair because he is very much a starter on most teams.The starting 5 tonight for Brooklyn were 4 guards and Deandre Jordan LOL 😂.
He was already one of my fave players when he was on the Nets.  It’s a shame star power relegated him to being second to the old shell of deandre jordan lmfao. Im glad he’s on a team that really values him now.
"Yes. We are past  Deandre Jordan  first team  Although you missed Shaq, Duncan, KG, Dirk so no"
"Drummond, Allen and Nance vs the corpse of DeAndre Jordan"
That's what happens when your best perimeter defender is KD and your rim protector is a 32 year old DeAndre Jordan
deandre jordan is not the answer
"It's not just that. Almost every champion at least in the last decade or so had great role players. Currently, DeAndre Jordan or Jeff Green (or maybe TLC) is their 5th most important player. I'm not sure if any of them would get major minutes on the last 4-5 championship teams."
At this point Deandre Jordan will become literally a piece of BBQ chicken by the time the playoffs come around ￼
"im just pointing out one problem lmao.... obv yalls defense is by far and away the biggest problem and deandre jordan is one of the biggest defensive sieves in the league rn. and he fucking sucks on offense too. sets shitty ass screens and moves so slow on his rolls. imo id like to see yall giving green more mins as the center. youll get fucking creamed on the boards and at the rim, but thats happening anyways and at least green is a really good pnr partner for kyrie and harden"
"not exactly because hes only really creating shots for himself. it takes shooting an ungodly percentage from midrange to make up for the inherent difficiencies with that type of playstyle. kevin durant and the dubs had similar problems (tho not anywhere near to the same extent) in golden state, where kd would often get lost hunting his own shot on middys, and even when he was shooting well the offense could get real stagnant and struggle to score. instead, theyd look better with curry running things a lotta time  but anyways, thats not their biggest problem. their defense is garbage. they have 0 rim protection. deandre jordan fucking sucks"
Why did nets trade allen again? He’s an up and coming youngster who is doing great fro the nets and is very cheap. Also he’s better than deandre jordan at this point.
"lol cant really get mad, this sub is super reactionary. kyrie, harden, kd is super talented, but everyone knew the fit was gonna be awkward + their depth and surrounding talent is weak af. they have 0 rim protection. since the harden trade ive been watching almost all their games, deandre jordan fucking sucks. theres plenty of bigs rotting on benches around the league that can fill his role better than he does"
"50 to 29 total rebounds.   Deandre Jordan played 26 minutes to contribute 9 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, 3 blocks, and 4 turnovers. Dude’s not good."
Imagine him being your center instead of deandre jordan
"DeAndre Jordan, Nene, or Faried?  Pick one."
Deandre Jordan is garbage
This is why you don't let players GM. Deandre jordan is a minimum player at this point
Deandre Jordan is so terrible. My goodness
DeAndre Jordan cant even hand the ball off without turning it over anymore
"Yo this is the 1st time I have watched DeAndre Jordan live action in forever, I thought people were being dramatic but no he is washhhhed lol. My God, he is just walking around out there."
They already have DeAndre jordan
Drummond can't score on or guard DeAndre fucking Jordan. Yeah Cavs need to trade this man asap
"They need a solid centre, deandre jordan athleticism went down these few years and the nets need to replace what jarrett allen offered for the nets."
Is there anything DeAndre Jordan can do to justify his contract?
If DeAndre Jordan was not everyone's best friend he would be playing a bench role on some scrub team
DeAndre Jordan is a free loader
lmao what is Deandre Jordan complaining about?
Deandre Jordan
I’ve aged like 10 years watching deandre jordan
So you are saying more or less mobile than DeAndre Jordan?
He kept moving the goalposts. He ended saying if you were 7 feet and averaged a 11-10..    If I was Kenny I would tell Shaq would be a less athletic DeAndre Jordan. And I would also add 3 words   Hack a Shaq....
How much more help does Deandre Jordan need?
He had lost it long before that.  Remember his Mark Cuban driving around downtown looking for Deandre Jordan tweet?
That’s meaningless. Deandre Jordan had a historical high FG% in lob city because it was all dunks
"That’s not true. Harden isn’t better than the depth they gave away. Look at the last game. Big 3 combined for 96 points, Harden triple double, still lost. And the big 3 played all around *50* minutes.   They will undoubtedly win some games but does the big 3 wanna average 42+ mins per game against the other contenders? Nah. They got beaten by the new Cavs and demonstrated the glaring holes in this roster. No defense, no decent big (DeAndre Jordan is not the answer lmao) and outside of those 3, Joe Harris, Shamet and I guess Jordan, that’s their team. Their only hope is to outscore their opponents and hope they miss, and for the occasional KD block."
"Wait so you’re telling me a defense with James harden kyrie irving and Deandre Jordan isn’t good? Shocking absolutely shocking.  BKN has serious defensive concerns but if they figure it out on offense (kyrie doesn’t go on an ego trip like in Boston) and harden feels comfortable enough to really take control of the offense and not be so passive to feed kyries ego, they should be fine."
Gobert only gets those numbers because they don't run plays for him. He just dunks it or gets put backs. They would throw it into Shaq on the block and he would end up averaging 27-29 ppg a lot of years and even more in the playoffs on that TS %. Gobert is like Deandre Jordan. Just finishes. No skills offensively.
I’d bet on the nets having 4 mediocre shooting nights before I bet on Giannis not dropping 37-17-7 on DeAndre Jordan. Jump shots are higher variance.
fair enough but prime deandre jordan is not close to current rudy gobert in any regards
i rate them  ive watched a lot of jazz teams and this is the best one in a long time  people act like gobert is deandre jordan or something lmao. he controls the entire game
"Send Kyrie back to Cleveland for some of their bigs and wing depth. Sending Allen away was a huge mistake..   30mins of DeAndre Jordan in the regular season already is barely passable. When the playoffs start.. holy shit, somebody call the AARP and send some lawyers down to BKN for abuse of old ppls"
Harden best playmaker on the team? You’ve got three guys who’s only play is dad dick every player on the court and shoot the ball. This team doesn’t have play makers. Best play maker is probably Deandre Jordan.
Giannis is just Deandre Jordan with a handle.
"By that token DeAndre Jordan, Capela, Randle, Valanciunas, Adams, Thompson etc. would be the goat and they’re not on Dre’s level."
"thank you. I don’t get the loss of depth argument. Harden &gt; LeVert, and Prince is only decent every like 4 games.   Losing Jarrett Allen was a huge loss for us though, and we’re getting destroyed in the paint because we have to rely on DeAndre Jordan who shouldn’t be playing big minutes, and a rookie who was selected 56th lol"
"DeAndre Jordan swung down and nailed Giannis in the face against the Nets, not even a b-ball play. Not even reviewed for a flagrant.   Giannis gyros with a basketball move and instantly called a flagrant.   hmm..."
"I doubt Deandre Jordan would’ve made them choose the knicks. Maybe kyrie, but KD is smart"
Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan. Picture how good the Nets could be with that duo
Rudy Gay or Trevor Ariza.  I trust DeAndre Jordan more than any of these free agent and potential buyout centers.
*DeAndre Jordan gives actual tombstone piledriver to Okoro*  Refs: Unreviewable. Nets' ball.
How many players do you expect to be part of most team’s playoff rotation?  3 open roster spots. The Brooklyn Nets just need a wing to replace Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot. DeAndre Jordan has played well in national televised games this season. I believe in Nicolas Claxton more than JaVale McGee...
"I think the responses to this game are a bit over the top. If Colin Sexton doesn’t have the best 10 minutes of his career the nets likely win this game.   And Kyrie didn’t take that many bad shots, he was just missing them. The guy had a rough night (still put up 30). That’s not gonna happen every time. He was missing wide open threes.  It also looked like Kyrie and harden tried a bit on defense towards the end and harden was grabbing offensive boards. They’ll need wayyy more of that going forward but it was a good sign.  They need to sign a wing defender (Andre Roberson?) and a center who can play passable defense. Deandre Jordan might be the worst starting center in the league. He’s just awful on defense and his offense is contingent on lobs from the point guard. Unbelievable that they killed all of their remaining cap space last summer signing him to placate Durant and Kyrie. I think Jordan bell is available but they could maybe steal a center from another team for some scrub and a couple 2nd rounders. They could also consider trading Dinwiddie but I think that should be the last option since they’d get a terrible return offer"
"4/18 is always a bad shooting game. But shooting != scoring, necessarily.   If Harden also hit 20/20 FTs then he had an efficient scoring game, which is what his TS% will reflect. Likewise, if DeAndre Jordan makes 5/5 dunks then he had an efficient scoring night even though he can't shoot a lick.   FTAs are naturally more efficient than FGAs, with a few exceptions (Andre Drummond, etc). So if you're trying to measure scoring efficiency, of course FTs need to be factored in. A point from a FT is still a point scored."
Deandre Jordan is going to play 7 minutes and foul out in the 3rd quarter.  Embiid averages 87 against the Nets.
"Look at all the mentors Jarrett Allen has had so far in the league. He now has learned under Ed Davis, DeAndre Jordan, Amare Stoudemire, and now Javale McGee and Drummond. Allen is going to be a top Center for the next decade. He is amazing."
Give them time to get it together and then see where they're at. It was the first game with Kyrie and first role change for Joe Harris (shifting to bench). Harden got DeAndre Jordan to be effective on the roll and their best 3 players played well without much synergy.
They used him almost like Deandre Jordan last night. He was their pressure release when they drove to the basket and just lobbed it up when the help defender came
"Yeah. I thought he was having a resurgence 2 seasons ago, and then last season and now this season he looks completely washed. Lob City Clippers were mortal enemies of the Warriors for a long time, so it's sad to see him go out like this. At least CP3 is still chugging along. DeAndre Jordan also looks washed."
they should trade him now sadly. get a big for some depth. deandre jordan sucks.
"When Nash said before the season started he'd try playing KD at all positions, 1-5, I thought he was just thinking about experimenting. Turns out they actually need KD to play defense 1-5. Their games are basically shootouts.   DeAndre Jordan was a massive mistake. This ain't no anime shit where friendship wins championships."
"Lakers big 2 can match the scoring of any duo in the playoffs and has the best defense of any duo, by far. In addition to that the Lakers bench is crazy deep with shooters and playmakers and  good defenders. I don't think the Nets big 3 would have fun playing 45 mpg in a 7 game series against the Lakers. We legitimately have 11-12 players who will see playoff time - AD, Bron, KCP, Schroder, Gasol, Caruso, THT, Matthews, Kuzma, Markieff, Harrell.  Nets have Harden, Durant, Kyrie, Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Shamet, Green.   I have no why idea why they went after Harden when they had Kyrie. Harden is just better in almost every way, now they have more iso and lost Jarrett Allen, who's hella good. This was literally a game where the bit 3 went off and they still lost lol."
Nets badly need a big man and some bench pieces. Literally besides Bruce Brown their entire bench is useless. And DeAndre Jordan will get destroyed by any above average big man in the playoffs. Sean Marks is a pretty smart GM so he better have something planned up his sleeve or this won't turn out pretty.
It cannot be stressed enough that DeAndre Jordan is currently the *only* center on their roster and he only played 24 minutes tonight. They need another big man and more defenders *badly.*
Even DeAndre Jordan doesn’t deserve minutes tbh. So basically 5 players
"Everyone said ""LOL Cavs have 20 centers"" Turns out when your only center is a washed DeAndre Jordan, you're gonna get rekt. KD is insane but they're going to have some horrible matchup issues"
lmao deandre jordan
"harden, durant, kyrie, deandre jordan and jeff green to me are better than lakers lineaup considering lebrons age even tho hes still great"
Deandre Jordan is getting paid by putting on his best Jason Garrett impression tonight
Deandre Jordan talking about himself
They were perfectly willing to post up Drummond on DeAndre Jordan but won't do it on Kevin Durant.  Weird.
I'd trade DeAndre Jordan for DeAndre Jordan from 4 years ago
They said lebron turned Kevin love and chris bosh into spot up shooters.  The Nets went further and tried to turn DeAndre Jordan into a spot up shooter.
Imagine an offense with KD on the floor and Deandre Jordan takes the shot from outiside the paint.
DeAndre Jordan?
"Jeff Green bent over on all fours, in pain   *DeAndre Jordan slaps his ass*"
"In the west no argument. In the East, I’d take him over Teague in 2015.  2017, pretty sure Deandre Jordan was a flex selection, so possibly in over him in 2017.  Again, those were years I think he had a case, but like OP said, he’s playing in the Golden Age of PG’s and had too much competition ahead of him."
"All of a sudden, the Nets got Lob City DeAndre Jordan"
deandre jordan is beyond washed
Is DeAndre Jordan still good?
Good luck with DeAndre Jordan protecting your paint in the playoffs.
"Look at DeAndre Jordan though. He figured it out. I think its a mental training thing, and not necessarily a ""put up 1000 shots "" thing."
"They just moments before they showed a ""micd up"" clip of Deandre jordan but the production team fucked up and you could only here the arena sounds of the clip, no Deandre."
I think this stat is a little deceiving. The Nets had DeAndre Jordan on Giannis and he was playing 20 feet off of him. DeAndre is one of the worst PNR guys in the league and was just conceding open jumpers. Let's see if Bud pulls this out when the matchup is a little less extreme.
Deandre Jordan it is
I was curious to see how far off Deandre Jordan compared to them all for the laughs:           3pt | 3p% | FG% | Ft% |   Harris | 669/1551  | .43 | .48 | .77 |   Durant | 1601/4186 | .38 | .49 | .88 |   Kyrie  | 1145/2931 | .39 | .46 | .88 |   Harden | 2355/6486 | .36 | .44 | .86 |   Jordan | 1/11 | .09 | .67 | .47 |
"I mean...DeAndre Jordan was a four-time All Defense player (2x 1st-team, 2x 3rd-team), and a 2x rebounding leader.  Granted he has lost a step since then, but it's not like they are just rolling some stiff out there."
True but look where they are now. Dennis Smith Jr. is gone. DeAndre Jordan is gone. They used that salary flexibility to sign Julius Randle and not much else because players weren't interested in playing with the Knicks. Porzingis was the only attraction to playing in NYC for other players and they shipped him out. He was literally their only ticket out of a 25 win seasons.
Deandre Jordan ending Brandon Knight's career
"Look, I know you’re a Warriors fan and you all can’t self-regulate since you weren’t loved as toddlers, but calm the fuck down you petulant little bitch. No need to get fucking testy over a critique.   Your hypothetical falsely implies that all-star selections are chosen by stats. They’re chosen based off of popularity. If they were chosen based off of stats, 4/5ths of Atlanta’s starting lineup wouldn’t have made the All-Star game in 2014-15 and DeAndre Jordan/Rudy Gobert/Joakim Noah wouldn’t have been All-Stars.   Also, how the fuck do you define ‘play the right way?’ It’s fucking basketball, not fucking Golf. There’s more than one way to skin a cat in the NBA."
this comment reminds me of the year DeAndre Jordan was an all-star because the Clippers were “too good not to have an all-star”. Terrible way of looking at it
"Blocks are cool but solid post defense is more important. Turner has gotten dropped off by 36 year old Dwight, Gobert, Deandre Jordan and other centers that aren’t even good on offense"
i'm the biggest Deandre Jordan fan ama
Eh Deandre Jordan is hardly a NBA caliber center at this point anyway.
bro you mean to tell me deandre jordan is a better shooter than steph?
"It's something bigs or rolenplayers do in games. Sometimes you can go long stretches withojt touching the ball in gsmes if you're not the primary ball handler. Going 15 mins without touching it and then immediately being expected to catch it and dunk/lay it up in 1.2 seconds can be a bit jarring so players will ask to touch it during free throw situations if they are right under the hoop just to remember the ""feeling"". Deandre Jordan used to hand it out to the rookie Nicolas Claxton during free throws as a little vet move just so they can both get to touch it a little bit in these situations."
They aren’t the worst defense of all time and one player can’t save a team with Deandre Jordan and no size lmao.
"Jokic is only more efficient in the seasons where he's scoring significantly lower PPG than Embiid. I know Jokic can pass out of double teams, my point is that you're only doubled if they're trying to get the ball out of your hands for somebody else to beat you, saying ""he just passes out of it"" ignores the base point of double teams. His stats are FG% in the paint (highly dependent on type of attempts, otherwise is Deandre Jordan the GOAT???) points per possession in the paint (same story). That's it. That's his proof that Jokic is a better scorer. Playoff numbers also ignore the fact that the only season Embiid hasn't been injured in the playoffs he put up 30 a game.  The people in here talking about playtime are the only ones who have a legitimate argument, y'all really reaching deep into your advanced stats bag to try to make Jokic look better than Embiid"
Pretty sure DeAndre Jordan has a higher FG% than literally everybody
"Woah imagine if Deandre Jordan just took every single shot, Nets would sweep everyone and become unstoppable, how come no one’s thought of this"
"&gt;To OKC: Deandre Jordan, Luwawu-Cabarrot, and 2 BKN 2nd rounders.  Bruh...Dort might be the defensive player in the league"
A center who cant shoot and has 0 post moves should never be shooting that badly. He in theory should be taking the highest percentage shots like a DeAndre jordan
Who could they get if they packaged DeAndre Jordan and Dinwiddie?
End of the day it works lol. Doc Rivers managed to meme DeAndre Jordan into being perceived as a perennial DPOTY candidate before he even played average defense.
"This comes across as a baseless comment. How are people ""underestimating"" them?  The Nets best perimeter defender is a 30 something year old KD &amp; they're rim protector is an older DeAndre Jordan.   How much can/do they really improve on the defensive end in the playoffs, relative to other contending teams?"

"Yup, nothing like letting Deandre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Steven Adams, all offensive juggernauts, have good games against you"
Deandre Jordan did this playing 35 mpg lol. Gobert too
Clampbed by DeAndre Jordan
lol first half DeAndre Jordan is Dwight Schrute from the episode where he gets the concussion
Deandre Jordan really turned into the DPOY for a half
Deandre Jordan got that Dirk Diggler Dick rn
DeAndre Jordan outplaying Sabonis is quite a nice surprise
lmaoooo DeAndre Jordan
"Watching DeAndre Jordan on defense every possession, wish me luck in resisting the urge to kms"
Do you think Giannis wouldn’t abuse Deandre Jordan???
"Our biggest needs for the buyout market are defense, size, and high IQ players. We’re playing TLC and Shamet a lot of minutes and I don’t think either of them should be getting playoff minutes. I also don’t think Deandre Jordan should be getting play time in the postseason. So if we could replace them with guys like Garrett Temple, PJ Tucker and Javale.. that would be a big upgrade (I’m sure there’s probably better moves that could be made)."
There is literally no way they go into the playoffs with just DeAndre Jordan right? They gotta get some kinda big even if he’s not that good
Agreed. I've never believed in Milwaukee and DeAndre Jordan would get abused over a 7 game series against Embid.     Doc Rivers will also coach circles around the Steve Nash.
"Just looking at some of the oldest players still in the league that likely could be had for cheap:  Iguodala (37)  Marc Gasol (36)  Carmelo (36)  JJ Redick (36)  Ariza (35)  Dwight (35)  Lou Williams (34)  Deandre Jordan (32)  Derrick Rose (32)  Blake Griffin (31)  Boogie (30)       The question is does he realize potential primes? like for the Celtics he could bring back Kemba, but does Tacko Fall become an even larger KG? or does he even reach current Dwight Howard level? or is it based on Prime that has actually happened to this date?       Either way,  Gasol/Boogie/Derrick Rose/Blake Griffin + Time Lord would pretty much be unstoppable. And that lineup is only $49m this year (2.5+2.5+8+36m) or only $15m if you take Melo instead of Blake.  So id still have over $95m to make a roster which i could make another super team out of and even if i bench Timelord, the old fellas are still competent role players without the Time Boost"
DeAndre Jordan old ass 😂😂😂
"Do you think tanking teams don’t do this? Derrick Fisher got blasted for winning a bunch of games at the end of the 2015 season. Gilbert Arenas explained when he was a sophomore on the Warriors they would sub him out when he plays too good because they wouldn’t be able to pay him. Gilbert circumvented that in his Gilbert Arenas way and said if they kept doing that he was gonna shoot every time he touched the ball. Miles Plummer was signed to give Hayes a pick and roll partner and still be bad enough, combine with Blake breaking down and there you go. Can’t win when your pf is broken physically, and your center can only play basketball the way he is taught and he has the touch of Andre Drummond and fluidity of a baby gazelle. Jerami Grant playing like same age Paul George while super amazing isn’t gonna do shit. Not when you need HOF verticality badge Roy Hibbert to win games. If they had a legit center (not Andre he would try to be like Jokic and look as coordinated as Plumlee yuck. (But if he played like Deandre Jordan then but I don’t think he can mentally right now) Pistons got the Lakers because outside of LeBron there isn’t the post scoring needed when a team like the Pistons has so many solid or good wing defenders."
DeAndre Jordan got too old? His defensive win shares plummeted but other advanced defensive metrics create an even more confusing picture.
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"We're something like league average when Harden is on the court defensively. The reality is our defense is bad for lack of rotations, ball watching, and the pure inability to create any protection at the rim. We were not good on defense when Allen was here, but he at least helped the rim protection part. Harden is not the worst defender on this team far from it, Kyrie was horrid this game and then there's......Deandre fucking Jordan."
"Be ""seriously concerned"" about the Nets when they start losing all these games when all 3 actually play.  &amp;#x200B;  They have like.. all their salary tied up in 3 guys and Deandre Jordan. When one of those 3 guys not named Deandre Jordan is out, they're probably fucked especially when we're talking back to backs in the regular season."
DeAndre Jordan was a high level rebounder and rim protector.
"Well, until right before they made the pick they thought they'd have a healthy Klay. Imagine Wiseman on that Warriors team playing the DeAndre Jordan role."
By not being deandre Jordan
"Who the hell is gonna stop Embiid lol, Deandre Jordan?"
Bro my friend said deandre Jordan would be “taught” by the Mavericks how to be a elite center if he were to join
The State Farm commercials always killed me especially the one with dame Kevin love cp3 KG and Deandre Jordan
"Yeah I mean I think people think I am shit-talking KG more than I actually am here. Siakam is lightning-quick with a 7'3"" wingspan and Millsap has been a perennial plus-minus darling due to his defensive awareness and motor. I guess the main thing I am underselling here is KG's motor, so, like, throw Marcus Smart in there too.  All I'm trying to say is that as a shot-blocker and roll-man, he wasn't even quite on the level of somebody like lob-city DeAndre Jordan or Anthony Davis (look at the numbers on block rates for example). This isn't just coming from numbers for me, think back to '02-'03 when the Wolves lost to the Lakers in the first round - KG had a great series but he was not really able to bully Robert Horry the way Duncan was in the next round (this series is burned in my brain because I hated those god damn Lakers).  So in the modern NBA his game wouldn't look all that much like AD or Bam, he really would be more of a power forward. You wouldn't want to use him much as the screen-setter in PnR and you would want someone else out there to bang with bully-ball centers (tangentially, imagine time-travel KG paired with KAT or Jokic).  I can see why there are AD comparisons because AD is the only guy impacting defense from the 4 like KG did but I think it's pretty different because AD is a better shot-blocker (who probably should be playing 5) and KG, especially early-career, was an _even better_ perimeter defender than AD is now. On offense, AD is a better roll man than KG was, but also I think often tries to play like KG used to and doesn't do it quite as well. That's why I reached for Siakam and Millsap, because I feel like those two are the power forwards who are closest to replicating KG's physical tools (Siakam) and defensive IQ (Millsap), but obviously combining the two and adding that Marcus Smart-esque fire yields an all-time level PF."
It’d be hilarious if Harden and Irving ball-watch the Nets out of the playoffs while DeAndre “calcification” Jordan gets burned over and over again
"Dive men have become an underrated part of the game. As has vertical spacing they provide. An elite dive man can do just as much good for team's spacing as an elite shooter can, there are just more elite shooters in the game right now. Prime DeAndre Jordan was an elite PnR roll man with elite screen setting, timing and finishing. Wish there were more guys like that in the league now."
"If they had a semi capable center instead of Deandre Jordan, who is only on the team because KD and Kyrie like him they would be hands down favourite, they truely chose the hardest road by dragging his washed up ass through the season"
"Cuban has a general reputation as a soft owner. People instantly believed the DeAndre Jordan ""begging thru texts"" story for a reason. He is 100% not someone I would expect to tell his player to ""not be a bitch""."
"&gt; DAJ = Lopez &gt;  &gt;   Wait what is Brook that terrible this year? Because aside from last night and a few moments here and there, DeAndre Jordan has been absolutely horrible. Like, worst player in the league type of horrible. Brook would have wide open threes for days with Jordan on the floor."
"Shit example, zion has literally been iced out of games in the 2nd half. Deandre Jordan didn’t have the capability while Zion does and is unstoppable. Giannis,pre 96 MJ and pre heat Lebron has this driver play style"
"It's hard to forcefeed someone down low.  It's the same argument as when people asked ""If DeAndre Jordan makes 70% of his shots, why don't they just give the ball to him every posession?""  Because getting into the paint is difficult and making entry passes is even more difficult."
What is unfair is that kawhi drives down the possession before runs into deandre Jordan and gets the foul call. Here kawhi clearly has contact with harden no call on him. I can see why kawhi sees an inconsistency when he got a touch foul on dj the previous possession then doesn’t get the call here because it’s the final possession
Kevin Durant James Harden Kyrie Irving DeAndre Jordan Joe Harris  Good luck scoring 90 without your starting 5
Been playing like prime DeAndre Jordan
Idk how you came to that conclusion he’s only above average on guards against wings and center he’s very good and at times elite  But the nets are a team that goes small and can play five out so your going to need a rim protector who is quick on his feet but at the same time can body up Deandre Jordan the only players who can do that is Giannis and possibly ad when he try’s   And when your going against a team with kd Kyrie James harden no matter how good those defenders are your going to need a help defender
That’s still not Deandre Jordan
"What does DJA mean? Are you talking about Deandre Jordan? If so, why the random A?"
"lol come on, you guys were ready to sell deandre jordan for a bag of chips 10 games ago"
It's the regular season. Who cares. I'd be more worried that a Nets team fielding 7 players on the end of a grueling 5 game road trip is about as strong as an almost full strength Clippers at home. The fact that DeAndre Jordan looked better than Ibaka and Zubac would trouble me deeply.
Lol agree but i don't think Clippers fans should act like they got fully robbed. Only reason they were in the game is because kawhi flopped on deandre jordan and got 2 FTs.
"Kawhi literally got a bailout call running into DeAndre Jordan just a minute before this, stop talking like Kawhi doesn't get calls."
So was the call against deandre Jordan also a terrible call?
Thank goodness for... \*checks notes\*... DeAndre Jordan.
"Deandre Jordan: ""I know this place"""
"I have never once said anything bad about Deandre Jordan. Nope, never, not once sir."
"Fucking pathetic flop won the game, Kyrie and Harden got bailed out in the clutch by Deandre Jordan"
DeAndre Jordan hitting game winning baskets and James Harden with game saving plays on defense  Welcome to the NBA in 2021
Wtf DeAndre Jordan  Also that wasn't an offensive foul
So DeAndre jordan game winning basket and James Harden game saving play on defense
I will never slander Deandre Jordan again  I will never slander Deandre Jordan again
"~~KD~~, ~~James Harden~~, ~~Kyrie Irving~~, ~~Joe Harris~~, **DeAndre Jordan** will hit the big shots for the Nets!"
"DeAndre ""volleyball"" Jordan"
I hate when DeAndre Jordan mean mugs lol. One of the most side character motherfuckers I've ever seen
DeAndre Jordan.
CLIPPERS LEGEND HYLAND DEANDRE JORDAN
DEANDRE JORDAN
DEANDRE JORDAN HOLY SHIT
Free Agency Hostages starring DeAndre Jordan sponsored by Raising Cane's
DEANDRE JORDAN PLAYING LIKE ITS 2013
Imagine getting dominated by deandre Jordan old ass
Honest question: does DeAndre Jordan do anything other than catch lobs at this point?
Brown Brown rolling to the basket with DeAndre Jordan camped in the lane
Ngl as long as deandre jordan is on the floor it should be straight PnR’s in his direction
Deandre Jordan gonna guard Anthony Davis? 😂 that’s a MISMATCH in the making for the finals
"no matter how many games this group wins, I will never forgive KD and Kyrie for subjugating me to watching Deandre Jordan attempt to play basketball"
Deandre Jordan finally gets the rebound.... but he’s out of bounds
DeAndre Jordan: Hold my rebound
"Deandre Jordan cant rebound properly, what happened to him?"
Deandre Jordan is a fucking scrub
Deandre jordan is so fucking useless
Deandre Jordan is embarrassing holy fuck he’s asshole
I hate DeAndre Jordan so much
So DeAndre Jordan was top 5?
"The scores will be combined at 300 points on every game, except game 7, where both teams will struggle to reach 80, with Robin Lopez and DeAndre Jordan being the leading scorers for their teams"
Brandon Knight’s block attempt on Deandre Jordan took a ridiculous amount of balls. Knight is a 180 lb guard and Deandre was one of the the most physically intimidating players in the league at that time. I’ll always respect Brandon for going for a play even though there was a 98% chance he was going to get clowned on because of it. He also went on to have a much better career after getting posterized which dispels any sort of myth the the dunk ruined him mentally.
On the first play DeAndre Jordan was standing in the key for 3 seconds when his man wasn't.   The second play wasn't a shooting foul cause the defender did not hit him while he was shooting. The player driving baseline didn't want to score/shoot **until** he got hit.  The defender tried to stay his ground but accidently stuck his chest out and bumped him. Realistically that's not a real foul but the NBA calls stuff like that as real fouls.
"1. 3 second violation. Meaning Deandre Jordan stayed under the paint for too long.  2. He was fouled before the shot. You only get free throws if you're fouled while shooting. It was a delayed whistle, but the foul was before the shot attempt. 3. Lane violation on Lebron. He can't go to rebound the free throw until it hits the rim."
"1. Defensive 3 second violation on DeAndre Jordan. Jordan cannot stand in the paint for more than 3 seconds if he is not guarding anyone  2. The foul occurred ""on the floor"", meaning the foul occurred  before the shot attempt, so no free throws were awarded  3. Lane violation on LeBron(?). Lebron cannot go for the rebound until the ball hits the rim"
"&gt; he also had to beat out western guards in the mid 2010s which was a death gauntlet with curry, harden, russ, cp3  I think in 2016 he didn't make the all-star team because the fan vote got Kobe in for his last year, and 2017 wasn't even cp3 in front of him, cp3 missed the game and deandre jordan and gordon hayward got the wildcard spots."
Unless you're Brandon knight trying to contest Deandre Jordan I got no problem.  In all honesty though fully agree I'd much rather see someone try and stop someone even if they get destroyed.  Granted I think some cases is kinda embarrassing because they're very clearly too late to stop the drive really like with Yuta. Dude had basically no chance of doing anything besides maybe getting a foul to stop that dunk. Rotated way too late.  Props for not giving up on the play but sometimes it just feels like you didn't need to contest it.
Always thought about this with the brutal Deandre Jordan Dunk on Brandon Knight. Yeah it was amazing and DJ flattened Knight...but Knight is like a whole foot shorter than DJ and STILL tried his hardest to defend the dunk. Respect for a guy putting his body on the line for the team play.
"I'm a Brandon Knight fan. I've seen this happen, he was considered the unluckiest nba player for a long time. Deandre Jordan almost ended my guys life...   But did he cry about it? No.  When Kyrie made him fall on his face during the rising stars game, did he give up? No!  You are NOT a disgrace for getting dunked on! You are a fearless fool!   Watanabe has my respect for putting his life on the line. Salute."
"I will bring this up anytime the topic arises.  * Brandon Knight is 6'2"", 182 lbs. * DeAndre Jordan is 6'11"", 265 lbs. * Pau Gasol is 7', 250 lbs.  * Feb. 3, 2013 - Brandon Knight, with his team down three points about half way through the fourth quarter, goes up against Pau Gasol on a fast break. [Knight throws down on Gasol.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow9aUPd2srQ) Nobody says a word about it. * Mar. 10, 2013 - Clippers are the better team. Andre Drummond is still out injured. It's the second quarter, the Clippers are up by 19, Chris Paul (possibly the best passer in the league at the time) throws a lob. Charlie Villanueva is in so the defense is trash, and [Brandon Knight gets dunked on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTkN2q6sUUk) It's considered the best dunk in years and people are still talking about it.  I will never give Brandon Knight shit for playing defense."
"They clowned on Shawn Bradley   Literally Brandon Knight is know for getting his ass baptized by Deandre Jordan   They would most definitely at that shit because it’s part of basketball. It’s not fair, good defenders get their ankles broken and nuts in their mouth."
Brandon Knight still hasn't lived down getting yammed on by DeAndre Jordan. Disrespectful? Sure
"Oh absolutely contesting a dunk is admirable and should be deserving of respect regardless of the outcome. And no one should be going out of their way to insult or disrespect a player personally, or via social media,  But...  With some poster dunks, it's mono a mono. One man completely beating, overpowering and dominating another. ""You vs me, and you lost big time"". Deandre jordan' dunk on Brandon knight for instance. Yea DJ has a massive size advantage, but it's 2 grown ass men against each other and one looked like a child.   Everything about disrespecting family and murder is just adding emphasis and humor to it."
At this points don't the Nets just need a Center like isn't Deandre Jordan near unplayable?
people reacted the same way to DeAndre Jordan (6'11) dunking on Brandon Knight (6'2)
"You know what?!?! That's a great point! When DeAndre Jordan did that dunk on Brandon Knight, he got so much crap for it but I always respected the fact that he played that ball the way it was supposed to be played. You see a lob going up and you are supposed to try to stop the ball. If you see someone driving toward the rim you are supposed to get into position and try to slow down or stop him. Clowning dudes for doing their jobs is short sighted and rude."
What was the point of deandre jordan
Well to be fair there was a lot of history between Jason Terry and lebron. Also I feel like dunking on a smaller guy just makes it so disrespectful cause it's not fair in the first place. See Deandre Jordan dunking on Brandon Knight.
I had this same thought when Deandre Jordan finished that alley oop on Brandon Knight. I’m like why is everyone losing their minds over this? Brandon knight is an entire foot shorter than Deandre lol. At least he has the cajones to go up and contest which most guys probably wouldn’t do
I’ll always cheer for Brandon Knight after the DeAndre Jordan dunk. People clowned him for actually trying on that play. I became an instant fan
Up there with all time greats such as DeAndre Jordan
&gt;Griffin on mozgov  Deandre Jordan on Brandon Knight
Depends how it happens. Like Brandon Knight literally died for our sins vs Deandre Jordan.
"Gobert wasn't 2nd, he wasn't in the list at all before reaching an egibility criteria. He'll enter several other lists in the next few weeks rather high including blocks % (probably 8th instead of Camby) and rebounds % (should be 5th between DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard)."
"That's why I always show some respect for Brandon Knight. DeAndre Jordan had like 8"" and 60lbs on him and in his peak he was one of the most athletic players in the league. There was no real chance in hell that Knight would block him but he still tried. That is all you can really ask."
&gt;DeAndre Jordan    Yeah all you had to point out was this. What a joke
"Bball Ref offensive rating is literally the worst advanced metric I have ever seen. It has no clear use case or objective in mind, it just lists players who have a high TS% alongside offensive superstars in seemingly random order. The all time top 5 is  1. Gobert  2. CP3  3. Jokic  4. Reggie Miller  5. DeAndre Jordan  I have no fucking clue why it exists"
Like luka doesn't get angry when rebounds get stolen from him too. Case in point; Deandre Jordan in his rookie year.
"Deandre Jordan on Brandon Knight will forever be undefeated, but this is pretty good."
Do you care how many points Deandre Jordan had when he dunked on Brandon Knight? Do you care if the Clippers won?  Absolutely not. Who cares about Anthony Edwards stat line when he had an all time dunk
"It’s not even stating facts he’s posting a fucking box score  Does anyone remember how many points Deandre Jordan had when he dunked on Brandon Knight? Does anyone remember if the Clippers even won that game?  No, of course not. One all time moment is all people will remember and trying to diminish that is most nerd shit ever"
"&gt; A few deandre &gt; A few Jr Smith &gt; A few Blake griffin   Are you telling me you think JR Smith, Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin have combined for roughly half of the best 20 dunks of all-time?! That’s preposterous."
Deandre Jordan on Brandon Knight vibes
"If you don't count the Braves years with McAdoo, it's kind of amazing that we've never had a better center than DeAndre Jordan.  Bill Walton played in SD and one year in LA, but he was always injured and simply not the same player he was in Portland.  Perhaps Elton Brand would be viable as a small ball center."
Some teams have a rule where the person with the highest FT% takes techs. The Mavs have this rule and it led to DeAndre Jordan taking a tech because he was hitting them at over 80% and it was hilarious.
"That’s like a Lebron on Jason Terry or Deandre Jordan on Brandon Knight level of dunk, like this is gonna be legendary. He just ran the guy through mid air."
"Clippers:  Cp3, PG, Kawhi, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan."
I think the nets even with this still need a decent rim protector deandre Jordan just isn’t cutting it but harden going to the clips sounds great they have defense shooting everything he needs to succeed
Best dunk since deandre jordan hate crimed brandon knight
Yeah I watched this several times and I’ll watch it again. Fuck this level of disrespect reminds me of the DeAndre Jordan dunk.. y’all know which one. Good shit right here. This is a career dunk.
The list is:  Vince Carter for obvious reasons   https://youtu.be/k_uZeCymShQ  DeAndre Jordan for intensity and sticking the landing   https://youtu.be/NTkN2q6sUUk  And now this dunk  That’s my list.
Brandon Knight gets destroyed by Deandre Jordan  Edwards and Anthony: hold my beer
That's a fucking legendary dunk. That is up there with Deandre Jordan on Brandon Knight. Probably better honestly.
This rivals the Deandre Jordan dunk if not better than.
"DeAndre Jordan getting all-NBA is the biggest joke in NBA history, in his prime he wouldn't be any better than Steven Adams today"
Shades of Deandre Jordan over Brandon Knight.  The way the victim got laid out...like a crime scene.
Shades of DeAndre Jordan
This happened briefly in that famous clip where Chris Paul is screaming at Deandre Jordan to put the ball back up. The reason DJ still had time to shoot it was a clock error so everyone was being too hard on him.
time to get rid if positions for all NBA. it was stupid when deandre jordan was getting all NBA teams and it's stupid now. make it the best 15 players.  not like these teams go play games.
"Yeah fr, bad PR for the nets, and DeAndre Jordan might be a diva to his new team if he gets traded, makes sense for no one involved to move him"
yeah DeAndre Jordan is not an attractive asset
&gt; that's why All-NBA teams are more meaningful  Has this ever been in question? And that's considering that Pat Ewing has the same number of 1st teams all nbaas Deandre Jordan
"He's a shot blocker through and through. He gets bodied by bigger centers, but he still gives it 100% everynight and is great at finishing up close/dunking. He's been working on extending his range, but that took a backseat towards the end of his time here. He's also the ultimate professional towards his teammates, not a lot of younger players would take sitting behind DeAndre Jordan in stride like he did"
Just because he’s their best backcourt player and the team has the best record doesn’t give the player absolute nod for all nba team lol with that same argument again if Nets ends up as 1st seed in the East just because DeAndre Jordan is their best center on the Nets doesn’t mean he gets a nod for all nba selection
This is why Kyrie insisted on replacing him with DeAndre Jordan.
To be fair DeAndre Jordan wasn't that great in 2014/15..
&gt;transition away from Deandre jordan   How I feel about this news   https://imgur.com/gallery/Ka6N0uY
&gt;transition away from DeAndre Jordan  https://i.redd.it/sne0aovrala61.jpg
Literally they paraded around saying Blake Griffin Chris Paul and Deandre Jordan could win a championship
"Damian Jones looked like Prime DeAndre Jordan with LeBron, Drummond will be fine."
Ain't no way in hell Deandre Jordan is ahead of Mcadoo on the depth chart.
"Imagine being a helluva a center and being the bench to DeAndre Jordan, also a helluva center.  The NBA is crazy now man lol"
"DeAndre Jordan be like, cool bro, I do this with Harden 5 times a game, every game."
How much help does DeAndre Jordan need?
I’m not just looking at TS%. I’m looking at volume as well. It’s not like we’re talking about Deandre Jordan averaging 6 ppg on 70 TS%.
John the Baptist is gonna drop 50 on Deandre Jordan
"New routines can freshen yourself up mentally, like moving on from bad habits. Kind of refocusing and if it works, you can build confidence from it.  Another recent one I can think of is DeAndre Jordan when on the Knicks, who started talking to the player to the right of him before every FT. Haven’t seen if he’s still doing it for the Nets."
"A drop is what you see KAT doing on this play where he kind of stands between Harden coming off the pick and Deandre Jordan, the goal of the drop is to hopefully concede midrange shots but if the big isn’t on point then it can end in alley oops like this. Harden in particular eats this coverage alive as he can pull up from three off the screen or throw the lob very accurately.   A hedge would be if Towns moved closer to Harden and sort of pretended to play defense while Harden’s guy recovers from the screen. After that guy comes back, Towns would go back to Jordan. This is risky cause if you don’t time it correctly then it’s free Layups for the ball handler when the big turns to go back to his man"
"no he hasnt at all. hes scoring very well but harden is averaging monster assist numbers. Offensive rating is a useless stat, deandre jordan and claxton are ahead of our other guys in offensive rating. its not useful."
That won't work. Players will just take less. Kd and Kyrie took less to team up with Deandre Jordan lmao. True parity in the nba is impossible because stars players are so much better than average players. But you can find ways to stop superteams though.
#OH WHAT A MONSTER JAM BY DeANDRE JORDAN
"Correct but it seemed shonuff420 was talking about prime Jordan (""DeAndre Jordan, knows his role on the squad get put backs, rebounds, all good"") rather than current Jordan. So i was pointing out how current Drummond is noticeably worse than prime Jordan"
"Prime deandre jordan was like 5 years ago, while Drummond is in his prime now."
Little mix of having Blake back and being favorites in the East is probably going to make DeAndre Jordan take his role much more seriously. Can only get better for the Nets from here.
"I concur. Technically, as odd as this will sound, the Pistons also had players that could make Andre look legit. There was a stretch in 2017 (I swear there’s statistical evidence to back this up) where Brandon Jennings, DJ Augustin, and Reggie Jackson all almost went 20-20 at different points that year and Andre was just feasting on lobs.   The flip side though, has always been Andre’s insistence on trying to do more. The threes, the iso crosses, the dribble into defenders for a contested leaner, etc. If you can imagine DeAndre Jordan spotting up for threes during the Lob City era, you start to get a better idea of what Andre’s been up to the past couple years.  That said, like Blake in Brooklyn, I think Andre in LA can serve as a new beginning where dudes with way more clout than he’s ever encountered won’t put up with much garbage."
Blake has historically been disliked by his teammates with the exception of Deandre Jordan.
"When they traded for Harden they had a strict, identifiable weakness. They had the corpse of DeAndre Jordan as their only big and they had no depth. It was an interesting gamble that was fascinating to consider. Signing Blake and LMA, both of them at least as good or better than most team's backup bigs, for a combined salary less than the 27th draft pick gets in his rookie year covers up their biggest weakness and pushes them from ""Super team but..."" to just ""Super team"".  If they signed these two and then traded for Harden you'd see similar."
"Andre Drummond was never, ever a No. 1 option in Detroit. He just constantly played outside of himself. He was a DeAndre Jordan type who never knew he was a DeAndre Jordan type.   That said, I don't think LeBron and Anthony will put up with Andre trying to pull that garbage in L.A. He'll either get it right or he's going to sit."
"&gt; dude is pretty much like DeAndre Jordan  Prime Deandre Jordan is better than prime Drummond though. More athletic and as a result of that and knowing his role, was faaaaar more efficient. Also a much better defender."
"All Star/GO to option guy, nope ... dude is pretty much like DeAndre Jordan, knows his role on the squad get put backs, rebounds, all good  Lakers have been looking for a guy like that for a while especially with LeBron/AD, I was kind of hoping Bynum was going to turn into that kind of player with Kobe/Gasol but man, injuries and ""trying"" to make him a scoring option not so much"
"I know I'm like ""who tf is that 4th person? DeAndre Jordan? I mean, hes kind of washed for being a starter on the top contender in the east, but *polarizing*??    I'm just going to guess Blake Griffin (circa 2012)"
"But if he was actually good you'd think someone would trade for him. Of course salary matching would be a problem for most competing teams but if there is an all-star level player available for essentially nothing teams generally find a way.   The Mavs, Spurs and Bulls are a few teams that had matching salary and could've used a free all-star.    Drummond's offensive rebounding is about the only thing he brings for the Lakers and it's a nice value add, though it does come at the expense of transition defense.  On the defensive glass however Drummond is very much in the Deandre Jordan mold where he parks himself under the basket and hoovers up every uncontested rebound his teammates try to grab. He also never boxes out so he gives up more offensive rebounds than you'd think.   Drummond's teams don't really see an uptick in DREB% with him on the floor despite his own numbers. Someone like Gasol on the other hand doesn't grab a lot of boards but is excellent at boxing out and letting his teammates grab easy boards. Marc's teams have consistently been better on the defensive glass when he's in the game.  The outcome of all this is that I think there's a solid argument that Gasol is a better defensive rebounder than Drummond. This will of course be blasphemous to you but the goal isn't for one guy to grab every rebound, it's for the team to grab as many as possible."
+ Prime Harden  + Prime Kyrie  + Deandre Jordan  + Blake Griffin  + LaMarcus Aldridge.   Heck half of the old Team USA.
The Sixers actually have a balanced combo of 3&amp;D and inside power.  The Nets are 3&amp;O and their best inside defender is the ghost of DeAndre Jordan.
"Think DeAndre Jordan, Jarrett Allen, Tyson Chandler etc. Imagine if Dwight would have run the rim like crazy"
"Whiteside averaged 17/14 and 2 Blocks per game on 32 minutes per game during the first year of his massive deal.  Whiteside looked elite in a time where the best centers at the time were Demarcus Cousins and DeAndre Jordan. This was prior to the emergence of small ball offense in the mainstream of the NBA.  Y’all look at one clip of him not trying on defense, and forget he’s an All NBA defender."
"DJ has the most efficient scoring season in NBA history on fucking minuscule volume. He’s taking 4.5 shots a game. You know why? Because that’s all his skill set allows him to take. Zion is taking 16 shots a game. You know why? Because his skill set allows him to.   Nobody is saying Deandre Jordan is a better scorer than AD. He and Zion could not be any different players, just an awful comparison."
"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, it's a totally valid opinion.  I would have thought the same a month ago but right now the Nets just look so offensively dominant.  Joe Harris could legitimately be a third option for any contender that has decent ball-handlers.  Deandre Jordan isn't great, but he also isn't trying too much. I would expect a marginal uptick from him in the playoffs. Jeff Green, Griffin and LMA aren't amazing but they all provide depth and versatility to the 4/5 spot.  Then you've got two guys who are top 10 scorers in the league: Kyrie and Harden.  I think they could win the East without KD, and I don't see any team beating them when they're at full strength."
"yes, as well as know blake is scoring the nets for 12 points on 36% from the field, probably making all nba first team. And then you got LMA dicking the league with a monster 14 points on a dominant 54% ts. Then you add another all star in deandre jordan, who with 7 points a game is probably the frontrunner for mvp right now.   So if durant could only win with all stars like that hes basically trash"
"Vintage DeAndre Jordan, current Rudy Gobert, sometimes Clint Capela. Guys who create space in the pick and roll by rolling hard to the rim. No postups, just screens, dunks, and rebounds on offense."
Prime DeAndre Jordan
"Hey cool, cuz DeAndre Jordan is still in the league to dunk ovr him!"
Everytime I hear about Brandon Knight I think back to the time Deandre Jordan ended his career. Like he literally ended his career I never hear about him period.
"The difference in that argument for a player like Aldridge is not gonna be whether they trick or treated for a ring pop at the end of their career. People aren't gonna suddenly look back at Aldridge NBA resume and think ""wow he got a ring playing 4 minutes a game, what an absolute god. He's so much better than Jimmy Butler, who took a team of sophomores and Goran Dragic to the finals.""  The rings argument matters when it's a player like Shaq shit talking a player like Chuck. Or if it's LeBron trying to make his case against Jordan. LeBron makes a super team and the rings still become a part of his narrative because he's the one who's carrying those teams. Nobody's going to look at LaMarcus fucking Aldridge or DeAndre Jordan and suddenly change their opinions on them because they averaged 2 points while benchwarming for the most stacked team in the league."
"I disagree. Dennis Schroder, Gasol and Montrezl are not better than Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and Lamarcus Aldridge. But if you add Andre drummond to the list, instead of Gasol. Then they’re probably equal."
1. KD 2. Harden 3. Kyrie 4. Joe Harris 5. Nicolas Claxton 6. Jeff Green 7. Bruce Brown 8. DeAndre Jordan 9. Blake Griffin 10. LMA
"Just play like prime Deandre Jordan, be an athletic elite rebounder who can be a lob threat. Please don’t pretend to be Hakeem"
Bron needs to convince him to be Deandre Jordan and not try to be Hakeem
After tons of people on here have spent all season saying how bad DeAndre Jordan is I’m confused as to why people are all of a sudden surprised when the Nets show interest in bigs that become available
I hear Brandon Knight and I immediately think of Deandre Jordan...https://youtu.be/mPN0ylFEaFo
Something something deAndre Jordan murder
This will be his revenge tour. He’ll singlehandedly beat the Nets in game 7 of the ECF and ice the game with a dagger over Deandre Jordan.  Bookmark this
Incoming DeAndre Jordan breakout season
I immediately think of DeAndre Jordan smh
"Yes and most people were fine with him starting a team from scratch with Irving. No hit to his legacy. Wants to be his own man with another person that want's to be his own man. No issue.   ... then they got Harden. A second perennial top 3 player in the league for the last decade and we all went ... what the fuck? Seriously? Okay I guess ... new Heatles .. but they have the same problem as the Heatles, junk after the top 3 and/or no defense.   ... then they got Blake Griffin who immediately remembered he could dunk, Deandre Jordan, LaMarcus Aldridge ... they have something like 45 all-star appearances on that team now ... this is bullshit.   Thus, the comment ""this Nets all-star bullshit team"", meaning it is an abnormality and on a different scale. The Heat had a big 3, just like the Celtics, the Spurs, the Lakers before them. This Net's team is literally on par with the East all-star team."
"&gt;Deandre Jordan, Griffin, and Aldridge  All Washed"
"Imagine saying in 2017 that the Nets will have Durant, Harden, Irving, Deandre Jordan, Griffin, and Aldridge all on the same team and that team will be the Nets. Everyone will probably think im a drug addict"
The only time AD made all nba without being in playoffs was in 2017 when the Pels were 10th.  And he was voted in as a center at a time when DeAndre Jordan was third team that year.
"What happened with the Warriors was and honestly still is unprecedented. The Warriors were one of the best teams of all-time. 67 wins and a championship then 73 wins and barely lost a championship in part thanks to some injuries and a suspension. Then they throw one of the best players in the league on top of that. Stacked teams with multiple stars have been formed many times, but we’ve never had an all-time great team just add an MVP. And I think a lot of the annoyance was directed specifically at KD. He was already on what was basically a super team and barely lost to the Warriors. Then he just joined them and made a super-super team.  Also you’re kidding yourself if people don’t think this Nets super team is ridiculous. Just look at this very thread. It’s filled with people complaining. And this team was really questionable not that long ago. Both Kyrie and KD were coming off big injuries, and they were not title favorites going into the year. And then they traded a ton of depth to get Harden and they were still not the favorites. And their other “all-stars” in DeAndre Jordan, Griffin and Aldridge were playing terrible and are way past their primes. We’ll have to see if they actually contribute much. What’s true is this Nets team is itself fairly unprecedented in that they made such huge moves mid-season. It feels really uncompetitive but I don’t think there’s anything the NBA could or really should do to stop stuff like this. The Nets just got kind of lucky to have all of this stuff fall into their lap this year."
"Also I feel like All-NBA appearances would make more sense of how talented this Nets team is.  This Nets team now has 31 combined All NBA appearances.  The Lakers last year has 29 combined All NBA appearances with Lebron over half with 16 the rest to a 34 year old Howard with 8 since 2014, and a 33 year old Rondo with only 1 in 2012.  AD the 'top 10' player in NBA only has 4.  Majority dominated by aging out players.   The Cavs with the subtraction in my comment above only has 16 combined ALL NBA appearances with again Lebron dominating with 14 and the other 2 with Love with most recent in 2014.    The 2012-13 Heat one will surprise you... they have only 21 ALL NBA Appearances, at the time Lebron with 9, DWade with 8, but the other 4, Ray Allen had 2 with recent in 2005, Leaving BOSH WITH 1! in 2007, the last one Juwan Howard in 1996.  Meanwhile KD's recent was 2019 year along with Kyrie AND BLAKE GRIFFIN, of course Harden last season, Aldridge in 2018, and DeAndre Jordan in 2017.  Not only they have the most All NBA appearances, but they have the most RECENT among the rest of the other teams in this OP."
"With everyone healthy, one of Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, or LMA will be the 6th man on that team. Wtf."
"If you don’t think this nets team is a super team, you’re out of your mind. 4 players shooting 50, 40, 90. 2 players who are top 5 scorers of all time and a 3rd who can play like one on any given night. A solid center in deandre Jordan who can finish lobs and contest shots. You’re delusional"
Deandre Jordan
"Five years ago DeAndre Jordan had just finished a season where he was All NBA first team and All-Defense first team and was in the middle of another All-NBA, All-Defense season. He had also just finished three straight 82 games seasons where he led the league in rebounds and shooting %, and he was only 27 so people thought he was just starting his prime.  Ask literally any NBA fan in 2016 if DeAndre Jordan was more likely to be a star or a bench warmer in 2020 and they'd all have said he would be a star."

"its hilarious that everyone keeps using blake griffin and lamarcus aldridge as super team defining pieces. theyre both like rashard lewis and shane battier joining the heat. Dont get me wrong, Irving, Harden and Durant are a super team but their next best player was Deandre Jordan."
" I mean if you add antawn Jamison to kyrie, KD, harden, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Deandre Jordan then yeah it’s a super team"
"League needs to step in and stop this. NBA is being RUINED by the day with all these players just making Massive superteams. Kyrie, KD, Harden, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, LaMarcus Aldridge. This isnt ok"
Completely forgot Deandre Jordan has an all-star appearance. He was never a big-man that could put a team on his back but he's fell off so hard that people are even citing him as a liability now.
LMAO they have so many damn all-stars that you forgot to mention DeAndre Jordan. And let's not forget they have 1 more roster spot for maybe Drummond.
Imagine telling NBA fans 10 years ago that Deandre Jordan would be all nba first team
"If I may chime in, Andre Drummond has never been a number one option. I think his field goal attempts have hovered between 11 and 14 for the entirety of his prime and at no point did the Pistons treat him like a go-to No. 1 option type of guy.   Drummond's shots tend to come in a few limited forms. Pick-and-roll dunk, tip-in attempt, jump hook, floater (?!), and shooting through the chest of an opposing defender. The thing that separated someone like DeAndre Jordan from Andre Drummond was DeAndre's early realization that he wasn't capable of making jump hooks, floaters, or forced shots through defenders.   To top it all off, around 2018 Andre decided he wanted to start becoming a 3-point threat. He's 10-92 from the arc over the last three years.   If the Lakers pledge to beat Andre with a sack of nickels anytime he decides to take it upon himself to start flinging floaters, trey balls, and iso-motions moves from the wing, he's going to be an asset. I think LA's a great place for him because he's always hit me as the type of dude who's going to want to please superstars so they'll like him."
"&gt; But people made it seem like Adams was just ""letting"" Russ pad his rebounding stats  This is true for pretty much all guard rebound though. Doncic, Westbrook, Jason Kidd etc. Guard rebounding has no correlation with winning. It is usually like 80% uncontested too.  &gt;Hes not athletic enough to be cleaning the glass like say a prime DeAndre Jordan would do  He has been the best rebounder on a couple of teams that have been number 1 best rebounding team in the league. He is one of the best rebounders in the league but doesn't get the raw stats like guys like Kevin Love or Hasan Whiteside got."
"4th option is Joe Harris, a top 5 shooter in the league.   5th is LMA (maybe?), a borderline hall of famer who, while a shell of his former self, still puts up 10pts/5rebs in his sleep who can get a quality shot off of anybody in the league. 6th option is Blake, another borderline hall of famer who is still a very good passer, decent finisher at the rim, and has developed a very respectable 3 pt shot.  This doesn’t include guys like Deandre Jordan, Jeff Green, or Bruce Brown, who are literally 7/8/9 off the bench. I don’t think I’m overrating the talent on the Nets whatsoever."
"Well that is what happened in OKC too.  But people made it seem like Adams was just ""letting"" Russ pad his rebounding stats when in reality its more so that hes just more impactful boxing guys out rather than chasing boards .  Hes not athletic enough to be cleaning the glass like say a prime DeAndre Jordan would do"
"I think some of these bottom feeder teams have to reassess how they develop young(ish) talent ... like not rookies, but young stars on their first or second big contract.  There's no reason that blake, drummond, deandre jordan to an extent went from all stars to unplayable all because they stopped caring or lack work ethic"
yeah but Deandre Jordan isn't James Harden (next time say DJ because when I first read this i imagined michael jordan on the team lmao)
Imagine telling someone five years ago that DeAndre Jordan would be the seventh best player on his team.
"Bro it's a 35-36 year old Aldridge who's incapable of moving, I'd be surprised if he even plays more minutes than DeAndre Jordan"
"If they get Drummond then their bench rotation will be some shit like Andre Drummond, Lamarcus Aldridge, Deandre Jordan, Claxton and Blake Griffin. They would destroy most bench units even if they're washed up lmao."
Who is going to be in the rotation over BOTH Aldridge and Blake? Jeff green? Alize Johnson? Deandre Jordan?   Claxton is the only one that might. But he’s young and probably won’t play in the playoffs.
"&gt;DeAndre Jordan might get a serious HOF consideration  Man, this just reminded me that DEANDRE JORDAN was once an All-NBA First Team player"
"Harden, Kyrie Irving, kevin durant, Blake griffin, deandre Jordan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Claxston, shamet, Bruce brown, Joe Harris, spencer dinwiddie. They have enough talent to create 2 playoff caliber starting lineups. Seems fair /s"
"All over this post revising history lmao both him and Kyrie talked about how excited they were to finally get to play on the same team together, how they had talked about it before both signing with the nets and bringing DeAndre Jordan along. All 3 of them played on Team USA and wanted to play with each other in the league. Stop acting as if the nets fuckin medical team is the sole reason KD is a net and that KD just got extremely lucky when everyone else joined him there. We get you're excited your team might actually get a trophy but God damn stop spreading bullshit like this. We all know how the league works these days, coming from a Lakers fan."
"Even Jordan is better, have you seen LMA play this season? And really, if you are comparing him to DeAndre, is he really such a big deal? Lol."
so is DeAndre Jordan. he aint gonna be playing 30-40 minutes. All they need is 15-20. Better than anyone else on list of bigs.
At least it wasnt Deandre Jordan to the mavs
Don’t forget Deandre Jordan lol
...and All-NBA first teamer DeAndre Jordan.
"4 years ago, Aldrich, Griffin, and Deandre Jordan would've made the team stacked. Now though, they're just bodies on the bench to provide depth. Either way, Blake and LMA are soft for this."
And deandre Jordan 😂
5 years ago DeAndre Jordan was someone too. He was all nba first team.
"This Nets team is beyond ridiculous, if they don't win the title this year, it would easily be the biggest embarrassment in league history imo.  The other ones that come to mind are 2011 Heat, 2015 Clips, 2016 Thunder, 2016 Warriors, 2020 Clippers, etc.   But this is just insanely ridiculous. Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc   I cannot even envision this team losing the title this year, so I would be shocked."
How much help does deandre jordan need?
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc  This is a finals lock, it would be an absolute embarrassment if they do not win the title this year."
"Imagine being told 5 years ago that Kyrie, Harden, KD, Blake Griffin, Aldridge, and Deandre Jordan would all be on one team and it wouldn't be team USA or an all star team"
"Nah we got Mitch and Noel for that. But yea less remembered was that the game after he eviscerated the lakers, Embiid had a nearly equally dominant game against deandre Jordan and the clips."
"The DeAndre Jordan Special**, Mans made All-NBA First Team one season without being an All-Star 💀"
Is DeAndre Jordan a lock in HoF?
What the guy who replied to u said was right. We did a bad job defending the paint and most of your points in the paint were successful pick and rolls. RJ Barrett and iq were driving to the paint and getting fouls primarily on Deandre Jordan.
Remember when Doc compared DeAndre Jordan to Bill Russell.
"Sounds like we heard this from him before, oh ya DeAndre Jordan was going to be the next Bill Russell."
"Here's [the rip from YT of the entire interview](https://youtu.be/-yf8esJ4czw). In terms of the Joel for MVP/Ben for DPOY segment(starts @ 7:32), there's not a lot of value b/c it's the same exact shilling and campaigning you've heard from Doc all year and from the rest of his career(e.g. DeAndre Jordan for DPOY).   Fwiw I love my man Daryl for doing the same thing over the years with Harden, D'Antoni, Capela, EG, Tuck, etc. What's funny is yall got the GOAT shillers for awards at both GM and coach now lol."
"Dwight fell off pretty early in the 2010s, while the first of the current top centers to make an All-NBA team were AD and Gobert in the 16/17 season. This was Embiid's rookie season and the second season for Jokic and KAT.   So between 12/13 and 15/16 we got old Tim Duncan, Joakim Noah, Marc Gasol and DeAndre Jordan as first team centers. People weren't saying the center position was dying for nothing."
Jordan.  Deandre that is.
They should've recruited him to go TO Brooklyn man. A center rotation of Deandre Jordan and Drummond taking away Claxton's minutes would get them taken out before the finals
"Eh, All-NBA teams don't paint a complete picture, as it doesn't really show the 15 best players in the league, just the best players relative to their position. Like DeAndre Jordan being on the 1st team in 2016 obviously doesn't mean he was a top 5 player that year.  Basically All-NBA team selections paint a picture of positional competition rather than overall competition."
"Okay, sure, Management handicapped them for decades,, but then its accurate to say no one wants to play for NY, because no one signed with NY, because they literally couldnt sign anyone. Also, not a good signing compared to who was available lol?  Centers available that year....You mean Nene? Marc Gasol? Deandre Jordan? Greg Oden? Tyson chandler was DPOY with them, and was really fucking good.  Yes, im sure knicks would have been better with those guys"
"If I was Deandre Jordan, I would fire myself. What the fuck is man doing out there guarding 2x MVP like that."

"Agreed, he looked extremely comfortable shooting the mid range. Deandre Jordan guarding him probably gave him some confidence tho haha"
[Paul Pierce attempting to participate in the 2015 Banana Boat EmojiFest](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2719108-banana-boats-and-emoji-wars-the-day-deandre-jordan-turned-twitter-upside-down) was pretty ridiculous.  Trying to join in with all of the other NBA players tweeting emojis but he was too old to understand how to do any of that shit so he tweeted a jpeg of an emoji instead.
only one team will let him take practice shots for two straight quarters cause they are stuck with Deandre Jordan
"I wish KD could be ""guarded"" by Deandre Jordan for 3 quarters and see how many free points he could rack up(Giannis was still superb in Q2-Q4)"
Deandre Jordan sucks ass
Giannis with a block on DeAndre Jordan.   FTFY.
"&gt; Now the other shots he took before that were terrible  Yeah. He looked off today.   Also DeAndre Jordan man... At least the Bucks have Brook Lopez so he isn't as much of a liability, but having to play him really sucks. Blake's more effective in his minutes. Too bad he's old and only has 6 fouls to give lol."
"One of the most entertaining games of the season. Kind of a fluke game from Giannis though, 50% from 3 (4/8) and hit a bunch of middies + I doubt he'll have Deandre Jordan guarding him 1v1 with no help in games that matter (unless Nash is the worst coach of all time).  Either way the Bucks are clearly in a different league than the Sixers, but still a tier below a healthy Nets team"
"Lol every top 10 player would give deandre jordan 50 in single coverage, some even 60"
He’s not going to have Deandre Jordan giving him acres of space every game unfortunately. Giannis with a consistent jumper against any sort of defence though is simply unstoppable
Deandre Jordan did not belong in this game. Horrible defense.
deandre jordan was awful today
DeAndre Jordan
But there was just a thread earlier about how DeAndre Jordan was able to slow him down. I'm confused now
Deandre Jordan is playing like 8 feet off him
"He’s cooking Deandre Jordan, it’s not that hard   This won’t happen in the playoffs"
What kind of strategy is DeAndre Jordan on the reigning MVP ?   All NBA 1st Defense DeAndre in his prime can’t guard Giannis yet they decide that’s the best way to go lol ?
 **Giannis**  might get 50 points on  **DeAndre Jordan**  😭
"DeAndre Jordan and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"
They got to find a way to guard Giannis if this happens in the playoffs Deandre Jordan cannot guard him
Lmao imagine having DeAndre Jordan guard Giannis
For the love of god please get deandre jordan off the court
Bucks can’t hold Deandre Jordan for some reason
Deandre Jordan is a very good post defender. He just struggles against stretch fives.
"Guess that's why they put Deandre ""white flag"" Jordan on him"
Fertitta trading him to Brooklyn for Deandre Jordan and 4 2nd round picks
"If the impact metrics take on/off into account - which I think some do - it's probably so high because of how shockingly terrible DeAndre Jordan is (Claxton never shares the floor with him).  That's not to say Claxton isn't good, because he is. But when comparing him and the Nets to when DeAndre Jordan is on the floor makes him look like peak Hakeem or something.  The DeAndre Jordan factor is why certain Nets players (like Harden) have worse on/off numbers and advanced metrics than they should, since they shared the floor with him so much."
"Blake, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet, Deandre Jordan, Luwawu-Cabarot, Claxton are all solid rotational pieces.   Steph/Draymond will show up but if that Nets team caught us on a day when Oubre/Wiggins aren't having good games then I can legitimately see us losing"
Giannis being guarded by Claxton and deandre jordan will be high on that scale
"Ye, a wall of Blake Griffin, Jeff Green and Deandre Jordan are really gonna slow Giannis down"
"Is he really an athletic freak? Maybe when he was younger but I honestly don’t consider him to be freakishly athletic at this point. Freak athlete to me is like young Dwight, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, AD, etc. Drummond isn’t anywhere near as explosive as those guys (in their primes) right now."
DeAndre Jordan has/had no offensive game at all lol. Horrible comparison
"DeAndre Jordan except he can guard the perimeter, isn't a liability at the FT line, can shoot from up to 16 ft out at a good clip, and can make the switch onto guards/wings in a pinch. So pretty much nothing like DeAndre Jordan."
"Peak Deandre Jordan with a good midrange game   I really don't see him becoming Joel at all and considering guys like him,bam, Jokic and KAT are relatively somewhat young I could see him struggling for all nba votes in the future"
Bahamian DeAndre Jordan
"The line-ups have been a product of a sensible rotation of Kyrie/Harden/KD (they've only played four games without any of these), and three players (Harden/Griffin/LaMarcus) who've come into the starting rotation, and finding better options than DeAndre Jordan. Not all line-up changes are born equal. The core outside of the big three (I'm saying Jeff Green/Joel Harris/Bruce Brown) have missed a combined 10 games out of 189.  I am not saying Nash is a bad coach. I am saying that he has a core of self-coaching superstars during his first year coaching in any capacity, during a unusual season. I am saying that Nash hasn't yet had the opportunity to prove much at all."
It’s just a meme from the Mark Cuban/DeAndre Jordan thing a few years back. I thought it was funny 🤷‍♀️
DeAndre Jordan
Deandre Jordan looks like a zaddy
"Yeah, looking at that list of names, only LaMarcus Aldridge was a bigger name to move teams. And DeAndre Jordan, almost. 🚀"
"Drummond is not a good player outside of his rebounding ability, but there is no denying he’s one of the best rebounders in league history. [This is all the proof you need.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/andre-drummond-is-the-real-board-man/amp/) He’s ranked second in OREB%, and first in both DREB% and REB% since Basketball Reference has been tracking that stat. Jordan is ranked fifteenth, third, and fourth in those stats respectively.   Adams meanwhile is tenth in OREB% all time and 217th in DREB%, and 97th in REB%. He’s just simply not the rebounder that everyone seems to think he is. Looking at REB% actually makes him look worse at rebounding than his per game stats. Even if Russ was “stealing” rebounds from him, he still wouldn’t be even close to Drummond and peak DeAndre."
"&gt; Zaza played 18 MPG. Why even include him in this data set?  I suppose for the same reason you include Looney, who played even fewer minutes.  &gt; Dude defensive stats aren’t some end all be all Jesus Christ lol they mean close to nothing, but being on a good defensive team will have your stats rise. He didn’t deserve all defense in 17, everyone who made it over him were better defenders. I’m not wrong, kd is not an elite defender and if he was this Brooklyn team would be better at D but they aren’t. You’re wrong. Bye.  I included defensive stats for you, because I’m assuming you watched fewer Warriors games than I did (you did).  KD can be (or at least was) an elite defender when he chooses to be, I’ve seen it.  If you haven’t, you haven’t been watching or don’t know what to look for.  But you seriously think one good defender at SF is going to turn Brooklyn into a decent defense?  They have Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin’s exoskeleton and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan on defense with Joe Harris coming off the bench for heavy minutes.  Even if KD were putting in an effort (he isn’t) there is no player in NBA history that turns that into a decent defense.  Come playoffs the Sixers (or whoever) are going to run over them."
"Curry does not deserve any all-nba team imo, 10th place is pathetic no matter what stats he shows and what records he breaks, that would be even worse than DeAndre Jordan case"
"Adams was not even close to the best rebounder in the league when he played with Russ. DeAndre Jordan and Drummond were the best by a healthy margin in those years.   If he was such a great rebounder he’d be getting more of them now that he hasn’t played with Russ in two years, wouldn’t you agree?"
"So I love Dirk but I feel like Mavs fans are a little disingenuous when they look back at it.   That team didn’t have another superstar but it had a lot of good players regardless and was well beyond decent, the key being there wasn’t really a weak link. Tyson Chandler went on to win DPOY within the next year.   There wasn’t a Joel Anthony, (2021)Deandre Jordan, level player you could easily exploit. Which is absurdly valuable when you have a superstar that can get his."
deandre jordan being one of the best passing big men in the league is my favorite Harp-ism
"You’re underestimating how bad everyone on our team is outside of SGA/Dort/Horford/Williams. Oubre/Wiggins easily start obviously. Poole/Looney/Lee/Bazemore easily play more than the rest of our team.  Our current rotation with no SGA and Horford, only Dort and Jerome can create decent offense. Dort is also our only plus defender really. Bazley/Poku are brick masters. I know they have potential but they play really bad, but at least Bazley has played great since his return. Roby/Moses Brown are also a horrible rotation. Luckily they’re getting this experience to develop though. I hope Bazley can become RJ Barrett-esque and maybe Moses can be something like young DeAndre Jordan."
"Steven Adams, Russle Westbrook,Ben Simmons,Jimmy Butler, and deandre Jordan"
So Deandre Jordan is the GOAT?
DeAndre Jordan being out of the rotation this game when he’s our only healthy center is interesting
"I'm not a Mavs fan, so I wasn't doing anything LOL. Still seems pretty clear to me that the Mavs won the trade.   Dennis Smith Jr was an overrated bust. DeAndre Jordan was old, and the Knicks waived Wes Matthews, which just leaves a few draft picks.  On top of Kristaps, the Mavs got the next best player in the trade (THJ), plus Burke and Lee were decent rotation pieces."
lowkey getting rid of DeAndre Jordan was the biggest win
"You've never heard the expression ""put him in a coffin"" whenever a guy dunks on a guy? This obviously wasn't one of those deandre jordan Brandon knight dunks but I think the announcer was just in the moment and probably wasnt thinking how ""ants bury their dead"" would be received the next day on reddit"
"&gt;No, that was his first year, and he was injured for most of the finals and he only even started half the games that year. And after that, the team was basically done anyways. Rodman only got good once isiahs career was winding down.   Oh my bad, it was his 1st of 2 lmao. That still proves he was a damn good player well before the end of Isiah's career lmao   &gt;Also, deandre jordan was literally first team all nba one of the years Chris Paul was there  Being a great lob threat while playing next to one of the best pick and roll players ever can do that for you.   &gt;Joe Dumars had never even been an all star until the end of the pistons main playoff run 1986ish to 1991. I think his first was 1990.   His first All Star was also the year he won FMVP lol  &gt; it’s also a joke Dennis rodman was dpoy coming off the bench most of the year. He was a pretty over rated defender. Dennis Rodman has way more name recognition than he should because he played for the bulls and he was a lunatic. That’s it.  Holy shit you're an idiot. This is definitely where the conversation ends lmao"
"No, that was his first year, and he was injured for most of the finals and he only even started half the games that year. And after that, the team was basically done anyways.

Joe Dumars had never even been an all star until the end of the pistons main playoff run 1986ish to 1991. I think his first was 1990.   You’re pretending that the pistons were some star studded team but they weren’t. They were a well built team but Isiah was the only star for most of his career. The clippers were easily more star studded. Sure, I don’t think deandre jordan should have been first team all defense, but it’s also a joke Dennis rodman was dpoy coming off the bench most of the year. He was a pretty over rated defender. Dennis Rodman has way more name recognition than he should because he played for the bulls and he was a lunatic. That’s it."
"You’re showing how little you know. Dennis Rodman was the 8th man on the team, was never considered a great player by any stretch of the imagination on the pistons. It’s just the only name you recognize. Cp3 played with Blake, deandre jordan and Jamal Crawford and couldn’t make it out of the 1st round most years  Edit: Dennis Rodman literally played like 19 minutes per game in the finals where Isiah was mvp. Rodman started getting better at the tail end of isiahs career"
"whats the minimum attempts? Im pretty sure deandre jordan is up there, since all his plays are dunks."

"Experience doesn’t equal production. Nerlens Noel of all people would body Deandre Jordan this isn’t 2014 nomore lol. In fact the second Knicks game, part of the reason the Knicks even snuck back is cause RJ Barrett etc was attacking DJ and walking to the paint in the 3rd  I think the point is pretty clear. Our defense increased dramatically when DJ did not play. That’s stats on this. Case closed"
No it ain’t. Kyrie can still be beat as the main guy and Blake is just a good role player. Deandre Jordan did not play when we signed LMA cause he’s that bad. He’s only playing now cause LMA retired.
i was thinking more a longer deandre jordan
DeAndre Jordan.
You fucked up bad if you let Deandre Jordan block your shot that bad lmao
"Based on my limited sampling of less than three minutes of watching the suns, ayton is deandre Jordan-level bad on defense."
DeAndre Jordan made a 1st team All-NBA. Jamal Maglorie made an All-Star team. The centre position was pretty grim for a period.
To this day I’m still surprised that DeAndre Jordan ended up making an All-NBA First Team
"Deandre Jordan made 1st team, let’s put it that way"
"Fat AD did great against us last time we played, but yeah, harden and Kyrie would feast on him so much it would make him unplayable and he’s like the perfect matchup for Deandre Jordan. DJ plays his best against slow footed centers  As for tonight. Mavs were serious about not wanting that play in lol."
According to that Jordan is the goat. Deandre Jordan tho.
DeAndre Jordan
"This is true, I remember that time CP3 tipped DeAndre Jordan 88 million dollars for rebounding for him."
Start Blake then. He can’t be worse than DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan is booty. How is he starting for the Nets?  I’m truly asking because I don’t watch the Nets at all
Deandre Jordan my friend.
He's not even the worst starter at his position in NYC.           DeAndre Jordan exists

"Kobe on those garbage mid-2000's teams was amazing to watch. Then you have your obvious answers: MJ, Cavs LeBron, VC. Early Blake Griffin was bonkers paired with DeAndre Jordan. Dennis Rodman was a spectacle. I can't put a definitive top 5 together."
Deandre Jordan and Brandon Knight.
Remember when Doc said DeAndre Jordan was better than Bill Russell.
Good now we don’t have Deandre Jordan making first team
Yea DSJ and DeAndre Jordan are REALLY pushing yall to the next level lmao.
DeAndre Jordan and Devin Harris... ok
"No you can’t. Bam, kawhi+siakam+gasol, that one game when kyrie let hortford guard Giannis, and AD are the only combos that can clamp him.  He’s averaging like 45 a game vs the vaunted deandre jordan + Durant front court.  And unlike embiid, he’s good at turning mismatches into open 3s for his teammates when doubled, so you can’t really play the “I’m just going to limit the teammates” game ."
DeAndre Jordan in that offseason was better than KP now  And they didn't have Luka back then
"They couldn’t even get deandre jordan. When dirk was in his prime, no one ever signed in Dallas. Why do you think an all star level player is gonna go there?"
"It's just today's landscape of center is so much more dynamic than when Jordan went to the All Star Game. If Capela was doing this back when DeAndre Jordan was making all-star games, then he would be too."
He's an awesome defensive player but this is hyperbole.  Doc does this for all his players.  Remember DPOY Deandre Jordan?
"Producers: ""Okay Molly, so you know what's happening on today's show, right?""  Molly: ""We'll be talking about the emergence of the Phoenix Suns this season under Monty Williams, with the impact of Chris Paul and the development of DeAndre Ayton?""  Producers:  ""Don't be silly - you need to tell Stephen A that LeBron is miles ahead of Jordan and will only solidify that with a ring this season. If that doesn't take us through to the end, tell Max that you don't want Iguodala taking the final shot for the Miami Heat in playoffs games this season."""
Deandre Jordan made the third team in 2014-15 and the first team in 2015-16 but wasn’t an all star
"Or because they know his minutes with Deandre Jordan sink his DRTG and because the DRTG without Harden also includes the pre-trade ratings where they had more capable defenders, including Jarrett Allen. With Harden and w/o DJ, they have a 110 DRTG. With Harden and DJ, they have a 116 DRTG.  But yeah they're definitely the bias ones and not a dude who spends 75% of his reddit time trying to make Harden look bad"
"Kevin is one to talk, 2 former MVPs on one team, one extremely good point guard in kyrie, a previous all star player in DeAndre Jordan, a washed up Blake Griffin, and a decent bench to compliment them."
Exactly lmao they got 5 all stars including Blake and Deandre Jordan. Before the dumb netsphews say they arent all stars you guys are probably the ones who considered Draymond green and Cousins allstars even tho they didnt even make it those seasons lmao
"That's the whole genius of it. If you ask him for his top 5 teammates now, you'll get DeAndre Jordan over Steph."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mbfqsb/james_harden_has_played_in_96_of_possible_games  Harden has played in more games than any player since he was drafted, although Lebron isn’t far behind. Deandre Jordan and some of these other players may have an opportunity to surpass him if he continues to miss time"
"&gt;It was reported that both PG and Kawhi were coming to practices late and had “superstar” treatment. Lou Will, Pat Bev, and Harrel weren’t happy with this and felt they got special treatment.   Ok what do this have to do with the Nets?    &gt;On top of the fact that Kawhi wasn’t a vocal leader, that locker room was far from sane.   How does this relate to us? Deandre Jordan probaly more vocal that Kawhi. Again, two separate situations   &gt;They only had a 3-1 lead because of talent, and lost it because they couldn’t overcome getting punched in the mouth.  The first couple of games were a back and forth.  Both kawhi and PG shot terribly especially in the 4th quarter of a game 7. Here’s a fact, PG has disappeared in close games before, and this was with **having chemistry**. Lou Williams has also been a negative on the floor in the playoffs which is why Toronto couldn’t wait to let him go off somewhere else. That’s while **having chemistry**. Montrez got destroyed by Jokic. He could have played 82 games with Kawhi/PG/Lou etc and that **still** would have happened. Chemistry wasn’t fixing shit, and it has nothing to do with the Brooklyn Nets. Nothing anyone can say could change that"
"He did... in year 1. Then Monty Williams got hired and he stopped using him in the post. Watch Ayton highlights from his rookie year. Even last year, at least he took mid-range shots. It’s tragic how he went from a imposing post and face-up threat to a Clint Capela/ Deandre Jordan type player.   Monty Williams, as great as he is, needs to be held accountable. There needs to be a middle ground in adjusting his role for current success and developing his game for the future."
"Idk, there's nothing crazy about 20/10 in 40 minutes to be honest.  If his shooting percentages are a result of him generating good offense then he should be taking way more shots. Being that efficient is cool for deandre Jordan in his prime because he couldn't generate anything so he had his fewer looks spoon fed. Being that efficient on such low volume as a main guy suggests a lack of aggression - especially when your team is struggling to score."
"DeAndre Jordan is out of the rotation, Nets centers are Blake Griffin, Jeff Green (who will probably miss a good chunk of the series if not all of it), and Nic Claxton."
The fuck is going on. LeBron thinks he's Harden. Kuzma thinks he's DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan haha
kenny thinks theres deandre jordan deandre ayton and deandre drummond in this game
I can offer you recent all star DeAndre Jordan
23 year old deandre Jordan who thinks he’s good
"cp3 had a prime blake Griffin along with deandre jordan, he choked in the playoffs. also had prime james harden but fell to injuries like always. PG didnt necessarily have the best team out of the 3 but he definitely played in a weak ass east"
it's actually deandre jordan. 1st team all nba all defensive teamer that the nets have been keeping in reserve
it does if it means more minutes for deandre jordan lol
Deandre jordan is a two way beast
"They really aren’t that similar to be honest. Deandre Jordan took around 85% of his shots from within 3 feet, whereas Ayton has taken just under 50% of his shots in his 3 years in the league.   Ayton has a mid range game and can shoot FTs, areas that Jordan has never been able to do. Jordan has always been an absolute monster at the rim, whereas Ayton has more of a finesse game with a soft touch.   The only thing these guys have in common is their name, the fact that they play the same position, and that they’ve played with CP3."
"I was really mad that following season. But I’ve always hated the Clippers since Lob City. I’m a hater on Doc, Blake, CP3 and their mentality seems to carry over to this current roster.   Obviously I hate them more now, but Deandre Jordan ended up being one of my favorite players even though he was only on the Mavs for a season."
Deandre Jordan has been out of the rotation for poor play for much of the season
Yeah but that took finesse. It’d be like if Deandre Jordan had faced up Dwight Howard and hit him with that move.
Wait they traded Porzingis AND Hardaway for Deandre Jordan and some picks?
most of them are centers IMO. Think DeAndre Jordan or Drummond. They aren't about to hit 1leg lean in 3 pointers on a regular basis like Luka LMAO
"Yeah imagine being the LA franchise that's had a winning record for 10 straight seasons (the longest active streak in the league) and several All-Stars (Blake Griffin x5, Chris Paul x5, DeAndre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard x2, Paul George) and 6MOY winners (Jamal Crawford x2, Lou Williams x2, Montrezl Harrell) ...  Yet has never made it to the conference finals and sadly plays second fiddle to the other LA team that had six straight losing seasons over the same timespan.  Just brutal."
"the points count for the same amount whether or not they come from a “two way player”   and deandre jordan was an all nba center and an all star what is this goofy shit, you telling me he wasn’t impressive either?"
"No problem, it's just not impressive. DeAndre Jordan used to score a lot in the same way and no one ever considered him a 2-way player."
"Man most Mavs fans I know (and I’m one) don’t give a fuck about Deandre Jordan. We fucking hate and I mean hate this Clippers squad though. The Montrez thing was nothing. It was really Morris being dirty, Beverley being a bitch, and just the whole team having the attitude they did like they were gonna coast to a ring. Because Houston sucks and SA is rebuilding I’d say most Mavs fans have more hatred for the Clippers than any other team at the moment. That’ll change when we start battling with our in state rivals again, but until then…FUCK THE CLIPPERS."
how do you go 9-20 from the FT line without Andre Drummond/Deandre Jordan/Jakob Poeltl
Do you guys still hate the Clippers from the DeAndre Jordan trade renegade/Mark Cuban driving around meme?
"What about DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin and Joe Harris?"
"After we stopped playing Deandre Jordan, our defense instantly became average. Claxton's also been huge for us."
The main difference is DA doesn't even create his own shots or the suns wouldn't let him this year. Last year he had post ups and etc even during the season. Tonight they turned him into DeAndre Jordan.
Is deandre Jordan that bad what happened

"Rob Williams has excelled in most stats this year though. Ignoring guys who’ve played less than 18 games aka a quarter of the season, he’s:   2nd in ts% after DeAndre Jordan  3rd in win shares per 48 after only Jokic and Embiid  Tied in total win shares with Paul George and Ingram despite playing about 850 and 1100 minutes less respectively  11th in bpm behind Jokic, Giannis, Steph, Butler, Lebron, Embiid, Durant, Harden, Doncic, and Kawhi - he’s followed by Dame, Zion, Kyrie, Vucecic, CP3  44th in VORP which considers playing time with 2.0 in only 985 minutes. Out of 91 players with over a 1.0 vorp, nobody else played less than 1000  minutes. Every player who matched or outranked him in vorp has played at least 500 more minutes but Durant."
1. DeAndre Jordan 2. DeAndre Jordan 3. DeAndre Jordan
1. Any of the big 3 end up on the floor   2. DeAndre Jordan being in the game   3. TLC being in the game
"They don’t have the most All-Defense selections. Plus, somewhat ironically, the 2 that they have come from Deandre Jordan"
"Why should the 95% who stay healthy and rested over the whole season limit themselves because 5% can't? Its professional sports on the highest level, people will get hurt. As long as the biggest chunk of the league can play all this games (like they have done for many decades now). Why should Iron Men like DeAndre Jordan limit themselves, because other players can't stay healthy? Sucks for them but it is what is on the highest level."
"Prime Blake griffin and Deandre Jordan were a wee bit better than DJJ lol. But if it means watching the Brandon Knight murder be re enacted with another player, I’m all for it"
"If it was between Shaq, Drummond, and Deandre Jordan it would be kinda interesting"
I said a mix of Ben Wallace and Deandre Jordan...Jordan for the high flying vertical aspect of his game. His game is nothing really like Capela or Draymond’s..his switchability is respectable but he isn’t nearly as good at it as Draymond.
DeAndre Jordan ? Montell Jordan ?
Oh you know you're fucked when your player comp is an unskilled Deandre Jordan lmao
sounds like deandre jordan without the dunking
"10x more athletic that Capella...not even saying he is as good as Capella yet because Capella has put up very good production for a solid stretch of time here, but its a terrible comparison by you.   Williams is an undersized, uber athletic center, amazing lob target who has ridiculous block rates and crazy instincts...I can't think of a great comparison. Maybe a mix of Deandre Jordan and Ben Wallace?"
DeAndre jordan
"No they won’t.  Joe Harris and DeAndre Jordan are the only players left with contracts of substantial amounts (for salary matching purposes), only young trade assets are Shamet and Claxton?  No picks to trade...  buy outs and vet mins are their only way to add talent for a while."
why doesn't DeAndre Jordan play anymore? it felt like Robert Williams and Tristan Thompson were bullying them inside
Kyrie and deandre jordan are going to look like the 96 bulls in the northeastern Philippine basketball league
only deandre jordan can save brooklyn at this point
deandre jordan is basically a mascot at this point right
"And Griffin, Harris, Deandre Jordan"
What's the O/U on DeAndre Jordan total minutes played this series?
It's crazy that y'all got him for just DeAndre Jordan and a couple late 1sts.
"Lol, this is him against the 7th best defense. The Heat have jimmy butler, iggy, and Bam. The Nets have DeAndre Jordan and Nicholas Claxton. Not even comparable."
We're better off using an actual chair in our rotations sometimes than DeAndre Jordan
"Career 48% FT shooter, DeAndre Jordan, shooting 78% from the line in 2018-2019."
DeAndre Jordan at 35
"They’ve played 8 games, most of them had DeAndre Jordan starting. This sub is predictable when it comes to kyrie and it’s hilarious to me"
The lack of DeAndre Jordan makes me question this
"Where the fuck is deandre Jordan? If he’s not on this list, then it’s unfortunately wrong"
I feel Deandre Jordan and TLC deserved a dishonourable mention here
DeAndre Jordan was amended
No. His own personal record. Every team he’s gone to he’s improved that team’s overall winning percentage consecutively. He’s never gone to a next team and not have his winning percentage improve.   It’s not his fault DeAndre Jordan is one of the most overrated defenders in NBA history or that PG hit the side of the backboard on a wide open three last year.
Cuban has a long list of beefs with players:  -- Kobe amnesty  -- Derek Fisher  -- Westbrook  -- Rondo  -- Obviously Deandre Jordan  Am I missing anything?
Deandre Jordan exists
"When you got 3 bigs on the floor with the Lakers (one being the ultimate playmaker, mind you), who’s gonna guard Lebron? Ok Kd. Who’s then got Ad? An older Jeff green or older Blake griffin? Umm sure. And then who’s got Drummond? Washed-up Deandre Jordan?! Lmao.   Do you see the problem? These other teams have defensive issues when it comes to guarding the Lakers. I’m not saying the Lakers can fully guard the nets, they got firepower out the ass, but the Lakers are one of the best teams equipped to defend them.   Jokic doesn’t have Murray and if they couldn’t knock off the lakers last year, they aren’t doing this year without a Jamal Murray. So bringing up the nuggets is just dumb.   But idk why you are now bringing up other teams. You started with the suns, and sorry to say the suns are not beating the Lakers 4 out of 7."
"Is Drummond just a worse version of Deandre Jordan (in his prime, not now)?"
"No, I didnt get into the nitty gritty. What is that like 25MM per season....for a BIG WHO CANT SHOOT 3s, stretch the floor or even have much of a midrange game? This isn't 1990 or 2000, of which that portion of the cap is warranted. Allen is a good big, a starter, but not a superstar. He's like a younger, harder working version of Deandre Jordan, imo you dont give 25MM to that type of player the way the league is trending. You give that money to a Joel Embiid type player who is elite defensively/offensively, and who can stretch the floor"
"You're thinking of it from just one perspective and not the other. Embiid is absolutely destroying everyone, has Ben looking for him and you add another All-NBA caliber player that likes playing with a big he can run plays with. Deandre Jordan is not stopping that, getting Harden back isn't either.  The Nets are definitely better offensively but you're talking as if their offense is infallible especially vs the 2nd best defensively rated team adding another borderline All-Defense caliber player"
Ewing had the misfortune of playing during the golden age of centers. Always had to view with folks like Hakeem and Robinson for those selections. It is still legitimately weird to me that DeAndre Jordan has a First Team selection though.
let him to back to the nets in a deandre jordan trade
" &gt;32 isn’t that old if you ask me  What if you ask DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, or Derek Rose? They all seem pretty far from their peak. They are all 32."
Lmao. I saw a tweet that said CP3's greatest accomplishment was getting DeAndre Jordan named to 1st team all-nba.
WHERE IS DEANDRE JORDAN
Deandre Jordan not ready for Lopez
Deandre Jordan
"&gt;We tried to trade for Christian wood and deandre Jordan at the deadline but both fell through  Fine, but alleging that the Rockets were incapable of acquiring an NBA-caliber center and were ""forced"" to play micro-ball is nonsense.  That would require a GM who is fundamentally incapable of his job -- in which case, firing said GM would be the obvious solution.  Even in 1960, competent centers were not impossible to acquire, and every team in the league had at least one.  As has every team since then, and many teams have had 3 or 4."
We tried to trade for Christian wood and deandre Jordan at the deadline but both fell through
"Patrick Beverley, Deandre Jordan, Chris Kaman, Corey Maggette, Eric Piatkowski, Gary Grant, Norm Nixon, Bill Walton, Randy Smith, Bob Kauffman - 1970-1971 franchise founding Buffalo Braves."
Bruh what. Harden was by far the better scorer in Houston and Blake was the teams best scorer for most of their Clippers run. Deandre Jordan was the most impactful defender on the clippers team and in Houston his defense wasn’t all that great and idk if I’d call it the best on his team. Not to mention all the playmaking stress Harden took off of cp3

"How did Jason Kidd (the only star for the Nets) or Steve Nash the 2x MVP of the Suns not have the same responsibility Paul had?   Kidd made two finals with Kerry Kittles and Kenyon Martin as his best players. Nash made the WCF with Amar'e injured and out for the season in 2006. He also made it three other times. Both of them were their team's star players. It's not like Nash and Kidd were coasting on another player's coattails. They were their team's clear cut best players during multiple deep playoff runs. Even Nash's first WCF run in 2003, he was Dallas' second best player behind Dirk (similar to Paul's role in 2018 with Houston), and Kidd in 2011 was Dallas' 3rd or 4th best player when Dallas won their title.   Chris Paul played alongside David West and Tyson Chandler in New Orleans, and then alongside DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin and JJ Reddick in LA, then as a second star alongside James Harden in Houston. Paul has had about the same responsibility as Kidd and Nash and same caliber of teammates too."
"Also centers have such a wide range, jokic and embiid’s shot selections are nowhere similar to a Clint capela or deandre Jordan."
DeAndre Jordan has been out of the rotation since Claxton came back btw
"Doesn’t really matter to be honest. Nets are in the West away from Golden State. Thunder and GSW are both in West. Nets also benefited from it. Got some form of a pick and through sign and trade with DLO, were about to sign Deandre Jordan for some reason"
Here's the top 5 alley-oop passers!  1. Trae (115) 2. Luka (81) 3. Harden (72) 4. Conley (42) 5. Russ (39)  And here's the top 5 alley-oop finishers!  1. Capela (87) 2. Gobert (83) 3. Ayton (74) 4. DeAndre Jordan (73) 5. Bam (62)
"Well, he DID technically pull a DeAndre Jordan and back out of a verbal agreement with the Mavs.  I just don't think anyone really cared because Dallas was bad and he wasn't exactly a guy that moved the needle much."
"&gt;Most prolific alley-oop duo (credit to lactardenthusiast for the idea)  &gt;**Clint Capela &amp; Trae Young (69)**  &gt;Mike Conley &amp; Rudy Gobert (39)  &gt;DeAndre Jordan &amp; James Harden, **John Collins &amp; Trae Young (32)**  &gt;Deandre Ayton &amp; Devin Booker (31)  Damn! I watch the Hawks, and even I didn’t notice how many oops compared to the rest of the league that Trae connects on. There’s a new lob city now!"
&gt; That DeAndre Jordan dunk at #1 is fucking unbelievable  Aka: Brandon Knight's funeral.
"People love to shit on Wiseman but the Warriors *need* a playable big at the 5 that can help on offense. As much as I love Looney he isn’t as big or athletic. The team would have a hard time against the likes of Gobert, Jokic, Ayton, Ibaka, Nurkic, Porzingis, or AD/Drummond, and that’s just in the west. In a Finals matchup they’d need to face the best of Embiid, Giannis, or DeAndre Jordan/Blake Griffin."
"That DeAndre Jordan dunk at #1 is fucking unbelievable, also #4 is insane too"
I think just being a good dude that is generally well liked by people has helped him keep his job tbh.  The DeAndre Jordan effect.
I mean it depends   Are we talking like   Basic Ass white boy attractiveness: Tyler Herro  Most attractive overall: Blake Griffin  Controversial Pick: Deandre Jordan  Or you are actually confused if he’s just an model on an extensive photoshoot and not an actual NBA player: Kevin Love  Or if you have a ostrich fetish: Chris Bosh
Yet DeAndre Jordan has an All-NBA first team selection under his belt averaging 12.7/13.8/1.2 in a season where Durant was on the 2nd team averaging 28.2/8.3/5. Moving to 3 frontcourt players regardless of position seems like the best choice.
"1. Games need to be THIS physical all year, the less refs micro-manage the game, the better the flow  2. Oubre please be healthy soon because Bazemore should not be seeing this many minutes --- a one-man wrecking crew(just dont know which side he's gonna wreck)  3. Valanciunas' defensive ""ability"" is eerily similar to Deandre Jordan and teams with great point guards will exploit that  4. Unless they decide to pick on Morant and his lack of any defensive help. Memphis in general is good at overplaying on the ball, but they do not cover weaksides well and suck at rotating back(there was a play where Bane and Jackson Jr. doubled Steph 27 feet out and BOTH left him wide open when he skipped pass to Dray AT HALFCOURT)  5. Morant will see wall defense from the Spurs since he has zero range and Memphis already is a poor 3 point shooting team with him hitting his regular splits  6. Warriors' downfall will be their inconsistent focus and their insufficient rebounding. They need a Denver win in the worst way"
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron’s effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie’s exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron’s people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA’s other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn’t pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
"The Nets defended Giannis pretty well. He scored 49 points in one game but he was hitting jumpers like crazy, something he will not be able to do over the course of a whole series.  Putting DeAndre Jordan on him and letting him sag off to watch Giannis chuck jumpers all game is a winning strategy."
DeAndre Jordan DNP  You love to see it
You really slipped DeAndre Jordan in there and think we wouldnt notice
Why’s DeAndre Jordan in the Bucks crowd
Who's the Deandre Jordan looking dude in the Bucks jersey?
Why does DeAndre Jordan keep cheering for the Bucks
Why is Deandre Jordan so happy?
Wait....Is that DeAndre Jordan on the sidelines? But wtf is going on?
WHY IS DEANDRE JORDAN WEARING A BUCKS JERSEY AND FIST PUMPING THE CROWD? LMAO.
DeAndre Jordan is HYPE
"Oh no lmao he strips kyrie, goes coast to coast and wins it with a poster on deandre jordan"
"Nets defense has been way better since DeAndre Jordan was removed from the rotation, he was pretty much singlehandedly tanking their defense."
Y’all see deandre Jordan with the bucks jersey dancing
"Deandre Jordan bad.  When DJ sits, Nets good.  OP doesn’t point fingers but that’s Nets D in a nutshell."
You can't seriously think that KD forcing a sign and trade to allow them to sign Deandre Jordan is any different than KD signing normally
"Yes. And I have maintained this for a long ass time, and a lot of people on this subreddit always argue with me when I say it.   And yes, before it's inevitably said, players have discussed who they want on their teams with their GM's, Barkley himself famously said as much when he was in Philly. But that on it's own is not a super team, even if his wish gets granted.   There are two types of teams that fans often conflate to be the same thing, and I maintain they aren't:    1 - **Super Teams:** Miami's Big 3, KD's Warriors, Brooklyn's Nets. That's it.   This is fairly simple to me, and there's only three instances of it existing. It requires all star players taking either paycuts, or using loopholes in the way the NBA contracts work to be able to make their team work even though in theory they should never be able to be on the same due to the size of the contracts they demand.   Coordinating in the off season, and taking paycuts with your friends so you can all strategically join one team is a super team.   - Lebron and Bosh took paycuts to make the money work out in Miami. [Source](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2010/07/10/lebron-james-dwyane-wade-chris-bosh-each-leave-15-million-on-the-table/) *""But they will be leaving $15 million on the table to play together. In the first year of their contract, Bosh and James will be making $14.5 million (Wade with $14 flat), nearly two million less than what they would have made base-year at the max (in a non-sign-and-trade). They’ll each receive 10.5% raises throughout the life of the contract.""*  - KD took a paycut to join the Warriors so they could keep Iggy paid. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/07/why-kevin-durant-took-a-10-million-pay-cut-to-play-for-the-warriors.html) *""Kerr says Durant’s generous pay cut allowed the team to keep Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston, which will hopefully lead to Durant and the team winning more titles.""*   - KD forced the Nets/Warriors trade to be DLo in a sign and trade. [Source](https://nypost.com/2019/07/11/kevin-durant-refused-to-be-traded-straight-up-for-dangelo-russell/) *""As a result, Durant and the Nets owned the high ground and were able to leverage the Warriors into parting with their first round pick. In addition to the pick, the Nets forced the Warriors to take Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, giving them the extra cap space used to sign DeAndre Jordan, Durant’s good friend and key piece in luring him to Brooklyn.""*   2 -  **Teams w/ stars:** Celtics Big 3, Warriors Pre-KD, OKC  All of these teams are GM's doing their jobs well, and being rewarded for their efforts with fantastic teams. Drafting phenominally well, like in the case of OKC and GSW, or trading well and getting those players.   GM's being great GM's fits within the context of professional sports.   -----------------------------------------------------------  Players being their own GM's and orchestrating their situation how they want it is an overuse of power IMO, and an indictment on the leagues rules that these three super teams were even possible. Essentially forcing the GM's to almost not even be a factor in the decision making. Doing this to tag along with your friends is what makes these teams different then any other dominate team in NBA's history."
"You give bit of a ""handicap"" for wing players/guards because for a post player to score you need to get the ball inside - and that is already big chunk of work done for them. They also score good amount of points as roll man in pick and roll - when ball handler does lions share of the work to get a score.   Wing players/guards start good amount of their possession outside and tend to create for themselves. Simply put creating iso for MJ was easier and included much less risks than setting up iso for Shaq.  DeAndre Jordan/Gortat scored 13ish points on like 70% eFG while having no offensive game whatsoever - because (especially when you have great backcourt) centers often get points served to them on a silver platter.  Again this does not mean that Shaq was not impressive during his peak, it is one of all time great peaks (tho I do think first 3peat MJ was greatest there was), I am simply adding context why people look at big men %s and guard %s bit different."
"Ayton looking like the best center CP3 has played with. Tyson Chandler was mostly a lob threat in New Orleans. Deandre Jordan took years to develop, had 0 offensive game, but was decent defensively. Capela is basically the same story as the previous two, mostly a lob threat with some rim protection. And Adams last year was okay but really a shell of his former self. Just crazy as a long CP3 fan that he can throw it Ayton near the free throw line and Ayton has multiple ways of attacking. Not too mention his defense might be the best part of his game."
They took less to help DeAndre Jordan join the Nets. Feels like an important distinction here. They could’ve done it without taking a pay cut
DeAndre Jordan not getting any playoff minutes with Nets just came to my mind - is he injured or something?
Slightly ahead of DeAndre Jordan!
"CP3 turned DeAndre Jordan into an All-NBA first team member, he was definitely expected to unlock Ayton"
"DeAndre ""Jordan"" Ayton"
"So if someone like Deandre Jordan, who doesn't play in crunch time, gets in foul trouble, you shouldn't care?"
Imagine having a Knicks flair and trying to teach boston a lesson in free agency. Knicks should at the very least have a competing team every decade. Yet literally stars signed with the Nets cus DeAndre Jordan told them the Knicks suck so bad
I'm still fascinated that late in the regular season the Bucks beat the Nets twice. Is DeAndre Jordan really that bad?
It's not the same as a coin flip. Where there's an equal 50/50 chance forever. It's not a static 60% chance of make/40% chance of miss. I'm not saying I think he's a 30% free throw shooter now but you can't just say he'll average out to 60 eventually if he shoots enough.   It's not a set determined percentage. Look at lebrons free throws. He shot 78% or an entire year one year and 66% for another year. Deandre Jordan shot 60% one year and 78% another year.
"What You missed:  Tyler Johnson Vs the Suns who cut him  Mike James vs the suns who cut him  CP3 vs former teammate Deandre Jordan  Amare is also on the nets coaching staff  Dantoni was the 7sol suns coach is now on the nets coaching staff  Sean Marks was a 7sol suns  Harden is an Arizona guy having gone to Arizona State  Potential first title for the whole suns team, Harden  Nash becoming the 2nd MVP ever to win a title as a coach  side note: putting CP3 as player coach to matchup with Nash is massively disrespectful to the best coach in the NBA monty Williams"
Brb gonna go watch DeAndre Jordan end Brandon Knight's life
Im just glad the days of Deandre Jordan 1st Team All NBA Center are over
"Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan improved their fts by making their routines shorter. Anecdotal yeah, but could be something Giannis tries in the future."
Why the fuck have I been thinking thinking DeAndre Jordan this whole time.
"Yes. Along with Steve Nash, Mike d'Antoni, Amare Stoudemire, Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, and LMA if he wants."
"I really don’t like hating, but i dont think you’re too far off.  What I take issue with is that if NBA talents who have NBA resources want to improve, they will. Take DeAndre Jordan from the foul line, or RJ Barrett going from a 32% 3pt shooter to a 40% in one season.  I’m very far from behind the scenes but it still doesn’t make sense to me that the guy still can’t even kind of shoot"
"Those games against the Cavs were their first games together and we were playing basically a completely different rotation. Claxton was still hurt at the time, we didn't have Blake yet (or Mike James), DeAndre Jordan and Reggie Perry was our big man rotation and TLC was getting big minutes."
Not gonna lie I read that and thought DeAndre Jordan since I mainly see people here only refer to him as Ayton. That being said he's a good up and coming C for sure but for now he's nowhere near Rudy's level.
"Giannis has such a slow release that the Nets can give him all that space and still comfortably contest the shot.   Giannis had some success in the regular season because DeAndre Jordan didn't bother contesting. Just gave him all day to shoot. Here you can see the Nets run at him hard once he picks up his dribble. When you need THAT much time to shoot, your coach shouldnt let you shoot off the dribble."
DeAndre Jordan?
flip the numbers and you get deandre jordan
"Lmao we can give you guys Deandre Jordan, and Spencer Dinwiddie but I don't even think I would give up Claxton"
What happened to Deandre Jordan?
He would force a trade so he wont have to play/lecture DeAndre Jordan 2x a game.  I always found their interaction so interesting.
And DeAndre Jordan.
"Once we kicked DeAndre Jordan out of the rotation, the Nets defense got noticeably better (from bottom 5 to around league average). Once the Nets ramped up their intensity for playoffs, their defense has consistently been very solid, a lot of their defensive mediocrity during the regular season was a lack of focus and commitment and those lapses are mostly gone."
Who in their right mind thinks that DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin are currently All-Star level players.   DJ is literally unplayable and Blake is nothing more than a solid role player now.  Talk about delusional and oblivious lol
"it absolutely is, Jarrett Allen would make this team absurd with his rim protection and rebounding  the Nets were still playing Deandre Jordan heavy minutes at the start of the season, which is one of the biggest reasons the team kinda got off to a slow start. An Allen+Claxton rotation at center is a nightmare defensively on top of all the scoring the Nets have"
"And still, after all that, DeAndre Jordan didn’t sniff the floor."
"Deandre Jordan: “Wait, I don’t have to play, and I can make $10 million and get a chip? Hell yeah, I’m gonna put my arm around the young in that replaced me.”"
the nets still have DeAndre Jordan as their secret weapon lol
Deandre Jordan cant get some cardio out there? Cmon Nash.
Deandre Jordan is the only Nets player without minutes
can we get some deandre jordan action yet?
They just need Seth Curry and DeAndre Jordan.
Steve should add insult to injury and play DeAndre Jordan
Curry abused Embild for five consecutive possessions by bombing 5 threes. Hope he doesn't play DeAndre Jordan defense on kd or Kyrie (if both the teams  meet in ECF)
"Imagine telling someone in 2016 that Harden, KD, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan would be on the same team together."
the nets will take him for deandre jordan! Or maybe the mavs can waive him and we can sign him for the playoffs next year?
Hardens out and one of those all stars is DeAndre Jordan
Deandre Jordan is the GOAT friend
"Finally, somebody tells it like it is. DeAndre Jordan simplex was not the goat guys."
"&gt; He's statistically the most efficient offensive player of all time  No he is not. Only taking assisted FG at the rim doesn't mean you are the most efficient offensive player ever, TS% isnt everything. He isn't even the best finisher at the rim. DeAndre Jordan wasn't the most efficient offensive player on the Clippers."
"The thing is, who else can do the things Capela and Gobert do on offense? DeAndre Jordan was an all-NBA selection and an all-star. Capela is a big piece of Atlanta's attack. Gobert does it the best of any of them. And Harrell is nothing like them so I don't think he belongs in the conversation.  What fans don't get is that athletic rim-rollers are rare and a valuable piece on offense. If everyone could dunk it everytime, that's all they would do. But they can't, and players that can dunk at a high rate are very, very, valuable."
Plumlee is actually good now and is definitely way better than DeAndre Jordan
"Alright. u/unexpectedvillain said it wasn’t even a discussion, and apparently to him it wasn’t because he never responded. But still. It’s definitely a discussion if every single stat that takes defense into account has Rudy as the better overall player when Rudy’s game is based on defense. Rudy fits the archetype of big man who works in the paint, has most of their shots assisted and has a super high TS% and FG%, sort of like Deandre Jordan. That’s valuable enough for him to be a plus on that end, which goes along perfectly with his unanimous DPOY level defense where he basically is the system for the Jazz."
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
As it stands right now it's hard to say how much value soon-to-be-33 year old DeAndre Jordan and Dinwiddie coming off an ACL tear on a contract year offer the Nets either.  This is a chance to get a guy who's still fairly young and a decent amount of potential for a team with almost no flexibility in the near future. I'm not sure how low Porzingis's stock actually is but the Nets should have no reservations about doing that.
Honestly I don't think the Olympics matter at all for legacy if you're on a stacked US team. I don't think of Harrison Barnes or Deandre Jordan any differently because they happen to have gold medals.
" Our bigs last time were Prime Boogie, Prime Draymond (fresh off a historical Game 7 loss), a start-of-his-decline Deandre Jordan, and Mason ""Olympic Melo"" Plumlee.  This time, it's inept scorer Draymond, declined Deandre Jordan, and a wiser Mason ""Olympic Melo"" Plumlee. lmfao hopefully Zion can guard the eastern euro 7 footers.    Just gotta find someone who's gonna guard jokic for Serbia and Patty/Ben/Jingles and co. for Australia"
DeAndre Jordan didn't exactly have a warm relationship with Luka
"Couldn't have said it better myself, one thing that boggled my mind as well,   It felt like Luka could hit anything he put up (in the 1st halves atleast), but then goes on to be a DeAndre Jordan level free throw shooter ?"
"And DeAndre Jordan, Capela, and Harrell are right there with him (using eFG):  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/efg_pct_career.html  This is not an insult to any, but a modern center that doesn't create a lot for themselves tends to be very efficient. In a simplified example, if all your center does is catch lobs and roll in a pick and roll, they can be damn near 100%, as long as they meet the minimum threshold for skill to do those things well.   This is why people started seeing non-unicorn centers as ""replaceable"": the skill of the center doesn't matter as much as how you use them.   With that said, that's mostly nonsense, cause guys like Gobert are very valuable for their rare defensive talent, but the point remains: efficiency as a center doesn't mean much on its own.   In fact, ironically, one of the best signs of an elite offensive center is that they don't have that 60+ eFG, cause that means they aren't mostly catching lobs and are instead creating for themselves. Even better if they have 3+ assists, cause lob and pnr centers rarely get more than 1-2 a game."
bro why are there so many comments about deandre jordan
"Huge Nets fan here, obviously we don't have the greatest interior defense. We do have Claxton who's so far in the playoffs and in the regular season has guarded Giannis very well. We also have DeAndre Jordan but he gets completely exposed on switch-offs and his lack of ability to guard the perimeter at all even to contest a shot. That's the reason he hasn't been playing. What it really comes down to is the bucks hitting shots. Something the Nets proved All season is that it didn't really matter how good your defense was, you just have to outshoot us. I don't expect the bucks to shoot 6 for 30 from 3 again, however to be fair I really don't expect Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving to shoot 25% from 3 again either."
"Honestly, this past FA didn't upset me as much as previous ones. I respected Giannis for staying with his team and it seemed like the Mavs didn't go too all in on him. It's FA years like 2011 and 2014 that upset me when we go all in on Dwight Howard, blowing up our championship team in the process. And then getting screwed by DeAndre Jordan and the Clippers leaving us with no real other options to sign."
Yeah we totally sat out FA this year to get a ticket to the Giannis pipe bomb dream show.  We swing for the fences in FA but we never get anyone...still fuming over [the banana boat gang shenanigans](https://grantland.com/the-triangle/winners-and-losers-the-deandre-jordan-emoji-fueled-free-agency-flip-flop/).  I would 100% have given up hope that we can build through FA or trades except that we gave all our picks away and a fan's always gotta keep some hope for self-preservation purposes.
Because that worked so well with DeAndre Jordan lmao
"Honestly it worked out fine. THJ and a lottery ticket on an injury prone unicorn is worth some low firsts, sleepy DeAndre Jordan, old Wesley Matthews, and flash in the pan DSJ. Obviously knowing how KP worked out I wouldn't do it, but it's not every day you can get a guy with such high potential in exchange for guys you wanted to get rid of anyway and a couple low firsts."
"Suns nets really has all the best storylines. Cp3 played with Harden, Blake, and Deandre Jordan. Nash, Dantoni, Amare, and  Sean marks are all 7sol suns vs the current iteration of the team. Mike James had his awful stint with the suns and we quickly cut him. Tyler Johnson had a stint with the suns and we cut him, though he left on good terms. Harden is an Arizona guy having gone to ASU.   Then the general David vs Goliath story as most been sleeping on the suns (some still are) vs the clear front runners from the beginning of the year in the nets. Even if I personally believe the suns actually stack up well if healthy. there is just a lot going on there."
Nah. I’ve hated y’all since the DeAndre Jordan thing.
"Also: Nets have Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. If the Clippers play the Suns in the WCF, the franchise will have to confront Lob City to win it all."
"As a Nets fan, you don’t want DeAndre Jordan"
Get him a center like DeAndre Jordan... The season 1 chemistry between them was like a poetry... Similar to Powell now
I kinda wanna see a Porzingis/Love/DeAndre Jordan front court the defense would be epic
"In fairness, Simons and Little were non assets until fairly recently, most of the Blazers' picks are out of the lottery because you keep making the playoffs, and you don't have KD/Kyrie calling Harden to have him force his way to your team (heck they even got DeAndre Jordan paid) or LeBron/Kawhi holding the Lakers/Clippers hostage to make them acquire their second star. When's the last time a top 15 player was moved for a borderline all-star and picks/prospects without one side having massive leverage on their FO to make the deal lopsided?   Lillard has minimal leverage since he signed an extension. The worst case scenario of not finding him better players is that he benches himself while the Blazers tank or leaves after his contract is over, but he'll be a 35 year old undersized point guard at that point."
"His contract kicked in this season. Now how the fuck do they have 2 supermax contracts,  a max contract and 18 mill joe harris and 10 mill Deandre jordan and 11 mill injured dinwiddie"
Michael Carter-Williams and Deandre Jordan       Shaquille Harrison and Royce O'Neale
"The Nets have a few second round picks, and I definitely expect them to draft some size. Dinwiddie will be an unrestricted free agent and realistically the Nets will look for a sign and trade somewhere. No matter what they get, it will definitely be somebody that is defensive minded. Also the good thing about contenders is they get players who want to win a championship on a cheaper salary example being Carmelo Anthony and players like that. Also, it'll be interesting to see what Drummond is worth. He practically tanked his value since joining the Lakers so he might only get a one-year mle deal.  Also the Nets are realistically going to try to find someone to take DeAndre Jordan."
[DeAndre Jordan does a great Chuck too.](https://youtu.be/8edRxLqmthI)
"Bruh you tried to include DeAndre Jordan as part of a ""deep bench"" 💀💀💀 you cannot talk"
No way he is. DeAndre Jordan is 6'11 and looks taller than KD in all their pictures together.
You just said having Deandre Jordan is something that helps your team being deep... And I'm the one who doesn't watch basketball?  Do you think using emojis somehow makes your point stick?
I read this as Deandre Jordan wtf
What’s the source material? Is it Cuban driving around looking for Deandre Jordan lmao
No dinwiddie no Deandre Jordan either
The Nets are really paying DeAndre Jordan $10.3M to dap up KD and Kyrie
Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan vs Chris Paul in the nba finals
Remember Deandre Jordan
Why doesn't Nets play DeAndre Jordan?
Why isn’t DeAndre Jordan playing?
"Jarret Allen, Levert, Kurucs, and Teraun Prince. These were the guys given up to get Harden. The Nets were favorites to represent the East in the Finals before the Harden trade. Do people really believe these guys are any better than whoever is on the roster for the Nets right now? Allen is basically DeAndre Jordan but younger and DJ isn't playing these playoffs. People can't use the Harden injury as an excuse."
Is DeAndre Jordan so bad he can't literally play at this level?
Is DeAndre Brioth Jordan hurt?
"Oof I wonder how many minutes trezz would have then. I’d say the Suns exposed the lack of depth or utilization the lakers had. Especially at the point. And honestly that isn’t so bad(esp after a title win and roster change) Chris Paul just BBQ chicken the game to the point where he barely had any effect at all towards the end. Dude just wanted to win.    Dude YES I 100% AGREE that AD needs to play aggressively. He’s got the build, form and presence to straight up take over that team. He needs that mamba mentality or something in him to just turn it on and Ball tf out. He needs to get out of his head. He’s a lot better than he thinks he is. Tbh that’s why I don’t like him or at least that’s why he pisses me off lol. He underplays himself. Drummond kinda reminds me of Deandre Jordan. They need a Pg to yell at them and put them in their spots to actually play well of at least not look like a liability.   You got any realistic landings on a PG? I don’t even know who would be available especially for the packages you guys have. If Pelinka plays this right and with this amount of rest, you guys can come back next season harder and better. Just trim the fat and find a brain."
Then why can’t Javale McGee average 30/13/6?Why can’t zubac be two time mvp and dpoy? Why doesn’t Mo Bamba lead a fast breath as the ball handler? Why can’t DeAndre Jordan have the footwork of Giannis?   There’s lots of “long” guys.. the difference is Giannis is large AND skilled
He is comparable to DeAndre Jordan but way more athletic.
"Well yeah Deandre Jordan has a better fg% at the rim but you don’t put him as a better finisher tho, typically you think of people driving"
I thought the same thing before I saw them play but they somehow made it work. Plus Jarett Allen was being wasted playing behind DeAndre Jordan anyway.
"that's what happens when you trade all your pieces for a superstar &amp; have 2 other max guys.  Not a lot of room left for other useful players, especially when you pay washed up DeAndre Jordan because he's tight w/ KD &amp; Kyrie..."
"Dinwiddie, Harris, and Deandre Jordan"
Because self creation is the skill that differentiates good players from great ones. No one will ever talk about DeAndre Jordan as an all time great because all he was finish plays.
"DeAndre Jordan made 1st team all NBA by being able to excute the ""oop."" Ayton is a better overall player than Jordan, so he could do the same."
You talking about All-NBA 1st Team DeAndre Jordan?
"And has no offensive game to speak of like a lot of bigs, too. Glorified Deandre Jordan."
"None of those guys were nearly as unlikable as the current ones. Blake Griffin is actually quite likeable and he was a great drunker, the lob jams he and DeAndre Jordan put down were a thing of beauty."
DeAndre Jordan is in tears.
"I actually used to like the Clippers a lot with CP3, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and Jamal Crawford. It was fun to watch them. Now it's impossible for me to like them for so many reasons  **Paul George** - dude saying so much dumb shit all the time, plus deluding the entire OKC and Indiana.  **Pat Beverly**  - I love his defense, but the guys never know when to shut the hell up, and plays very dirty, resulting in various injuries.  **Marcus Morris**  - Do I even have to say why this guy is an asshole?  **Boogie Cousins**  - Again, a complete asshole who can't keep his emotions. Should become a boxer instead of a basketball player if he likes to fight all the time.  **Patrick Patterson**  - just have bad memories of his time in Toronto. Never worked out, partied all the time, didn't care whatsoever.  **Kawhi Leonard**  - I know I should adore him for helping the Raptors get their first ring, he's not an asshole by any means, but holy fuck is that guy boring as hell. I respect that he prefers his game to speak for him, but it's hard to root for a guy who avoids any talk, and constantly looks like he just wants to go home."
"If you think ayton is at this point any better then any of those 4 just because he has good shooting percentages, which is a function of him being a non primary scoring option, and a decent defense vs back up centers, then you really don't understand much about basketball.   You know who had the highest true shooting in the regular season? Deandre Jordan. Is it because he is the best center in the NBA? No, it is because he does not need to create and shoots only when he needs to do minimal work. If ayton develop an outside shot and playmaking abilities, which he won't and shouldn't given his attributes, then he would be the best c in the league. Still a great player tho!"
"deandre jordan made 1st team in the worst era of centers in league history.   With jokic playing and possibly giannis and AD being moved to C position on all nba team if voting clashed it is hard for ayton being the 1st team all nba since jokic,giannis,AD probably gonna average 25-10 or more a season"
DeAndre Jordan made 1st team all-NBA.  Ayton would see that as a good start
Young DeAndre Jordan but with a jumper.
Im no nba coach but playing the free throw game only up 3 seems too damn risky. If clippers make both free throws and suns missed 1 you just gave the clippers a chance to get back in the game. Unless its someone like shaq or deandre jordan idk why you would take the rism
Ayton is DeAndre Jordan with a jump shot.
"No it wouldn't, it would just force mid level guys to take the minimum instead. The Nets would spend 90% of their cap space on the 3 stars and then use the 10% for role players instead of paying guys like Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan  If given the choice between paying stars and role players, NBA teams will always pay stars"
You’d expect Dallas to hate Deandre Jordan no?
It happened right around the Cuban-DeAndre Jordan copypasta
Yeah especially if DeAndre Jordan make 1st team All NBA
"Pre 2017 in the 10's was for sure one of the worst eras for big men ever. I mean DeAndre freaking Jordan was 1st team all NBA in 2016, and he barely had (has) any basketball skills, just his length and athleticism without any other abilities lol. I think he's without a doubt the worst 1st team all NBA player in the post merger era"
2016 was a really bad year for centers lol deandre jordan was first team all nba over boogie because boogie received some 2nd team votes at forward
DeAndre Jordan in charge of security
"Salaries don’t have to match in trades.    Teams should be able to haggle for extra assets if they keep more of a players salary vs having to take on bad contracts. The $ will still be on the ledger but it’ll make a ton of trades easier for overpriced Vets.   Other sports have this ability and it should be in the NBA.   Only downside is the teams at the top could be able to dodge the Luxury Tax. Even then it would be up to another team to accept enough assets to make it worth it.   For example Kevin Love is owed roughly $30m per year over the next 2yrs and  DeAndre Jordan is owed $10m per over the same time.   Let’s say the Nets and Cav’s wanted to swap players but the Nets couldn’t make the $ work.   Cleveland should be able to say to Brooklyn “Hey, we’ll do this swap and we’ll eat the extra $40m. But we want picks 27 and 44 this year as well as 3 more swaps in the future.” Or whatever they agree upon."
That was the old rule. The new rule is extending the old rule to all 4 quarters. A simple google search would have told you this. Looks like your username is as accurate as always.  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/07/13/nba-rule-changes-hack-fouls-deandre-jordan-andre-drummond
"Then let Trae do that DeAndre Jordan approach of chatting up his teammates for the first 10 seconds, then launching his ft the next 3 seconds. It'll show giannis how annoyingly long he takes and might force the referee to be stricter"
"The Clippers weren't an embarrassment, but they weren't ever taken seriously either. VDN got the Clippers back to back winning records and playoff appearances, but you can't ignore Doc helped the team achieve 7 straight winning seasons and 6 playoff appearances including 4 consecutive.  And are people forgetting the era this was in? The Spurs were still an elite team competing annually, the Thunder had KD and Westbrook, the Rockets became a contender behind Harden, the Warriors were about to explode into a dynasty.... The Western conference was a beast to overcome and all of those teams had an MVP on their roster at some point in the era.  Meanwhile Doc had to find ways to win while BG and CP3 missed games, always ended up creating strong sixth men like Barnes, Crawford, Lou Will and Harrell. Also did a great job developing JJ Redick and DeAndre Jordan into starters with elite level talents.  It's easy to look at box scores and say Doc didn't get further than VDN in wins or losses or postseason progress. But you can't ignore the rest of the West, the injuries they dealt with, and the positives he brought to the team. And he faced it all consistently and never had a losing season, all while regularly playing against equally stacked Western teams with a ton of MVPs in the same conference."
Well he was doing a good job of trying to sign Deandre Jordan (through texts)
Deandre Jordan
"Glad to see Chris Paul lead the Clips to a WCF win! It’s weird tho, I didn’t see Blake or DeAndre Jordan out there"
"Dwight Howard, Al Horford, DeAndre Jordan were at one time All-NBA centers that are still kinda in the league, its just that ""pure"" big men just don't cut it anymore in the modern NBA.  Jonas Valanciunas, Steven Adams, Richaun Holmes kinda fit the bill, but aren't as dominant as the first group in their primes."
"Ayton’s % are as if he is deandre jordan but he is posting up, scoring midranges, etc"
Deandre Jordan needs a shout out
I still find it hard to believe Diamond Stone never panned out. Thought he'd be the next DeAndre Jordan.
Deandre Jordan.
"Honestly once they covered up our banners with random pictures of Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan, the hatred was seared into my soul."
LAC prime CP3? 🤣 they had him Blake Griffen and Deandre Jordan all in their primes and couldn’t do anything! This makes me laugh so much I love seeing CP3 get smoked by my grizzlies all while playing whoop that clip (trick) To answer the question Magic on the Bucks would be dynamite
Blake Griffin/Chris Paul/DeAndre Jordan  and  James Harden/Chris Paul/Carmelo Anthony  &amp;#x200B;  ??  Okay bud
Luka Doncic traded to the Nets for former all stars Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.
i hated that clippers team.  DeAndre Jordan just rubs me the wrong way
"Jordan Poole, Deandre Hunter"
"Ok? That doesn’t change the fact that DeAndre Jordan was extremely limited offensively in the type of bucket he could get, compared to Ayton. What are you on about."
Lmao dude I wouldn’t call Prime DeAndre Jordan skilled offensively.
And prime DeAndre Jordan wasn't skilled? I mean the dude's FG % was out of this world...
Deandre Jordan was a sub 50% career free throw and never had any offensive game outside of lobs and dunks.  But based on your comment history your trolling and should probably take a break from Reddit.
Ayton in his skillset and the type of shots he takes is closer to a prime DeAndre Jordan than to KAT or Jokic lol.
"No I agree with you but at the end of the day it’s free throws that he has been a killer at all career. I’m sure it’s bothering him more than anyone. I think if it was anyone we would say it’s on that person. Pg, kawhi, Lebron, mj, Kobe, shaq, deandre Jordan, Ben Simmons.  Regardless of who it is, they need to make free throws."
But if they have Harden then Simmons isn’t playing with the ball in his hands the most. And Simmons is a muuuuuuch better defender than Kyrie.   I mean the hack a strategy has been employed for decades and teams still aren’t technically losing a series because of it. The Clippers didn’t stay in the 2nd round solely because of Deandre Jordan. The Lakers didn’t lose in 04 because of Hack-A-Shaq.  So I think adding a guy who can guard the opposing teams best player so KD can rest on D is a net positive.
DeAndre Jordan really never managed this?
"Jordan passed to Kerr from the wing on a designed play to get things moving first. Devin booker passed off Jae Crowder(who you 100% don’t want taking that shot) who then turned in to Mikal Bridges. Who has been anything but good shooting the ball from 3 lately.   I’m not saying he shouldn’t have passed the ball. I’m saying more should’ve been done previous to that. Deandre Ayton and Cam Johnson(who actually had the hotter shooting hand) go far side as booker comes to collect the ball. He slowly dribbles up, double teamed roughly 30 feet from the hoop. He flips the pass to Jae crowder the inbounded. Who then kicks a pass to the corner to a guy who’s been ice cold for the series and last 5 games.    You compare it to jordan and Kerr. But that was a designed play with lots of movement going on. There was absolutely zero movement on this one. And the suns got lucky that somehow the shorter guy going for the rebound knocked it out of bounds. Because if it goes off Ayton, that’s game, or if Ayton cleanly gets it where he’s at, he would’ve had less than two seconds to gather and put it back up.   But I think you missed my point. It’s not that he passed. Every legend has a big time game winning assist. But it’s that there was nothing smooth about that play. And booker didn’t even pass it to bridges anyways. Booker kicked it to Jae Crowder, the last man you want shooting when you absolutely need a bucket."
"“This is Deandre Jordan, Mike D’Antoni trying to get into the locker room”"
"So Milicic &gt; Lebron, Melo, Bosh, Wade because he got the furthest in the playoffs the earliest? DA is far from an allstar meanwhile Luka is allnba first team... Gap is massive, eventhough DA has been ballin, but he is a glorified DeAndre Jordan atm."
"Drought soon to be over. Just picture Jared Goff with a rocketship emoji next to his name except not a real emoji, it's whatever the hell Paul Pierce tweeted when DeAndre Jordan was being held hostage. With a great defense and a great running game and great special teams, a 10-7 wildcard season would be in reach for Goff. The Lions have all those things, right?"
"Yeah, comparing Kidd and Simmons as shooters is like comparing Joel Embiid and DeAndre Jordan.   Kidd was shooting 3-5 threes per game and hitting them at between 30% and 37% for most of his 20s. Also, other than his first 3 seasons, he was around 80% from the line."
They couldn't even keep the FAs they agreed with. Remember DeAndre Jordan?
Most being key word…. Then you got guys like deandre Jordan and how Kim Noah who blow your mind when they shoot free throws lol
Google ‘DeAndre Jordan Dallas Free Agency’
"Lmao this is so stupid. Even as a Bron fan there was literally nothing KD could do to win that game at that point, he played an obscene amount of minutes coming off an Achilles injury with his best teammates alternating injuries in the playoffs.   The more important point is that this is the trade off for making a super team. They traded depth and defense for superstar power on offense and of course the one time Harden gets injured in the postseason it’s this year. Also a reminder: DeAndre Jordan is being paid 10 mill a year from the KD+Kyrie tax and didn’t play a single minute of the playoffs."
"Of course it’s still head and shoulders above the rest.  But that’s not my point, usually USAB in the Olympics is an exhibition of the best of the best basketball has to offer at every position.  I have an affinity for the Center position because it’s what I used to play.  2016- DeAndre Jordan , Boogie Cousins, Draymond   2012 -Tyson Chandler, Kevin Love, AD  2008 -Dwight Howard, Boozer, Bosh  2004 -Garnett, Mourning  1992- Ewing, Robinson, Malone, Barkley   Don’t you think the current big lineup is underwhelming in comparison to those ?"
Iirc most of time in the Olympics they aren't playing with a true center. They literally only had Deandre Jordan And Boogie last time. Everyone was 6'9 or shorter. You can clearly tell in this thread who actually has and hasn't watched the Olympics the last few times. Hell I remember in 2012 they had Tyson as their ONLY big but they played LeBron at center a decent bit with Carmelo playing the 4. And there will probably be cuts but I think this is as close to the true roster we're gonna get since the Olympics start in a month when usually it's the year leading up to it.
"&gt;reality is bigger players are less durable  Gonna need some proof for that claim. Plenty of small players get hurt too because they need to compensate for their small size with crazy cuts and explosiveness: Rose, Kyrie, IT, CP3, etc. And plenty of big players are super durable: Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Perkins, etc. Seems like a mixed bag to me."
DeAndre Jordan is pretty good on his day.
"But you’ve already shot standard your whole career (like Ben, Giannis, Drummond, Deandre Jordan, etc). You’ve practiced standard FT (like I’m sure they all have).  You wouldn’t try something new?"
"But what has happened to him is over the past 4 YEARS... he was playing like he had crazy upside to be possibly Lebron 2.0 with his passing, athleticism, lighter version of Lebron's 27/7/7 statline with 18/8/8.  He's been to many playoffs that go as deep as second round but those second round trips other than first one lost in 7 with exception of first trip losing in 5 to a young heavy teamwork Celtics.    The first second round loss that went to 7 was ended in a crazy Kawhi game winner that if it missed, they head to OT.  Yes, his FT shooting wasn't as shit as it was this year, but it's still alarming that after first playoff run, the rest till today his free throw shooting is at 42.5%, huge drop from debut playoff run at 70%.  If you're so limited skillwise scoring the ball, then why is it that after all these playoff runs, you don't work on your free throws.  Even centers fix their shitty free throw % percentage to be respectable, ask DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond.  You don't have to have midrange or 3 to be a good player in NBA, you can dominate in paint all you want, but except to be getting to line alot and be forced to make free throws.  This gotten him so mental that he passed up a easy dunk to Thybulled who got fouled and split the free throws. Sure this is current issue but Ben Simmons being in NBA star for so long and in deep playoffs for years now has NO FUCKING EXCUSE TO LOSE TO A FIRST TIME PLAYOFF ROOKIE THAT WENT IN REBUILD MODE LAST FEW YEARS TO NOW A ECF?!!   Hawks give them credit, but they tanked for much fewer seasons than the Sixers for the entire 2010s trying to get the Embiids and Simmons to help them compete and this is what Simmons does?  Overall Simmons is still gonna be nice but from here on out, he deserves every single slander that goes his way."
DeAndre Jordan also upped his free throw shooting a bit too.
"The Nets defense with DeAndre Jordan on the floor was the worst in the NBA by far this year. Their defense with DeAndre Jordan off the floor was around league average. I don't deny that the Nets aren't built in a defensive-thinking way but DeAndre Jordan is a defensive liability straight up today, he only makes things worse, not better."
"We’re not trading Smart. TT is for sure gone.  Also, DeAndre Jordan ? KP ? A lot of the guys on this list either have little to no trade value or their trade values are rock bottom rn.  Believe it or not, GMs aren’t as reactionary as the media or fans."
"Revisionist history. Harden wasn’t on the team when the decision was made. We were more than a full year from that even being an option.     So yes, leaving the Warriors, even with an injured Klay, for Kyrie and DeAndre Jordan was a bad decision in terms of the on-court game."
the anti-deandre jordan
"&gt;The two kind of go hand in hand. He's playing less aggressively because he's scared of getting sent to the line because he can't hit his free throws.  The weird thing is he isn't a uniquely horrible shooter.  In the regular season, he has shot 60% or more on FTs every year other than his rookie season. Pretty bad, obviously, but it isn't DeAndre Jordan or Drummond levels of bad, either. And DeAndre or Drummond would have absolutely dunked the shit out of this.  Simmons has been shooting progressively worse with literally every playoff series he plays. Shot 71.4% in his first ever series (against the Heat in 2018), then 69.6% in the next round, then 58.3% in the first round in 2019, then 56.3% in round 2, then 35.7% in the first round this season, and 33.3% in this series.  He's getting *worse* with more experience, rather than better."
"Does he still have Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen or do we mean literally *these* nets?   Lebron, Harris, Green, Griffin, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Mike James, and Deandre Jordan doesn't seem like it could possibly make the finals."
Dragan Bender - lol  Jahlil Okafor - lol  DeAndre Jordan - maybe a bit of a lol  Andre Drummond - oh god  DeMarcus Cousins - wasn't his fault he got fucked by his body  Andrew Wiggins - meh
Well thats not strictly true. Deandre Jordan was a bad FT shooter too. He found a routine that worked for him when he came to the mavs and his FT went up like 20%.
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
seriously that bum deandre jordan is getting paid 10 mil this year and curry is getting paid 7.8 mil to outplay an All star in game 7 in the play offs. Darely Morey showing us again that he is one of the best GM in the league.
"I remember that playoff series. TD was giving DeAndre Jordan work! If it weren't that last minuye heroica of CP, Spurs would have probably seen the finals again."
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan were adults who cared about improving. Simmons is basically a lazy high schooler.
&gt; Basically any allstar played basically the whole game.  Deandre Jordan: Am I a joke to you?
"Don’t forget DPOY, 1st team all nba and 1st team all defense DEANDRE JORDAN!"
"You keep saying what his job is when I’ve already outlined it, his job is to anchor the defense. The entire Jazz system which has been elite on defense for years is revolved around Gobert. That’s why he gets paid 40 million.   You’re acting like he’s a glorified Deandre Jordan lol"
"TBF Doc does a great job in lobbying for his players, he even got enough hype to put deandre Jordan on an all NBA team"
"miles and miles ahead of simmons for sure. he came out of college as a guy that ""has a way to put the ball in the basket'. but I don't remember his jumper being that good. he scored most of his points off cuts to the basket, floaters etc. When he came into the 18-19 season he shocked every suns fans with his astronomical improvement in 3 point shot.   Deandre Jordan (or was it drummond?) had a massive improvement in his free throw percentage a few years ago didn't he? hell maybe simmons should start there."
"I can't confirm but I'd imagine the Clippers may have been there at one point. Griffin was in consideration for MVP (3rd? in voting maybe?), had Chris Paul, and DeAndre Jordan. Clippers never made it beyond the second round prior to this year.  Mind you they may have all peaked at different times but I'm not sure."
"DeAndre Jordan played 0 minutes in the playoffs, I can only assume he doesn't get minutes anywhere next season, especially on the Nets"
"I guess the hope should be Doc developing Simmons into a more well rounded player? Like he did with Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan? But man idk, his situation looks bleak."
"Giannis rarely dunks when he finishes. Most of his finishes are lay ups at incredibly difficult angles. Even if people watch his games, still don't know his game, it is weird. Guy is a finisher not a dunker. DeAndre Jordan is a dunker, a guy who would mostly or only score with dunks (in the lob city era).   Giannis is a very different archetype of a big, the run and dunk meme was not supposed to be taken seriously (and it wasnt at the time), that's not how he plays (save  2-3 plays a game)."
Deandre Jordan dunked over 6’3 Brandon Knight and it’s widely regarded as the best poster of all time. Height doesn’t matter when someone chooses to challenge a dunk.
"I actually made a typo lol. Kevin Durant had FOUR all-stars on his team (James Harden, Blake Griffin, Kyrie Irving, and DeAndre Jordan)."
You forgot that DeAndre Jordan is also an All-Star.  Lol.
let's see what the Nets do next season.  They owe the Big3 $120 million on top of Joe Harris $16mil and Deandre Jordan $9.8mill.
"They had plenty of guys capable of NBA minutes. TLC, Clayton, Deandre jordan, Shamet, Tyler Johnson   Also, seeding didn’t matter. Play worse players ans lose games who cares, 2 seed or 4 seed…or 5 seed, Doesn’t matter with that big 3."
He should be getting paid more than Deandre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan would get destroyed in the pick and roll  I agree they should have played Shamet more tho  Lots of iso plays cause whos fucking scoring on this team aside from KD
"Health will always be their biggest obstacle. If Kyrie and healthy harden are playing, it’s likely a done deal that they win the series. It went 7 without em.   They do have Deandre Jordan and Claxton for size who both didn’t play."
"no Nash just let the team underachieve (even with the injuries) and play a isolation game instead of having a plan, plays, or a scheme. And the DeAndre Jordan mystery..."
Why shoot 12 3s if you're so injured that you're bricking everything. Deandre Jordan probably could have shot better than 2/12 from 3. He needed to be smarter
"Thats actually a troll comment obviously, but i'll respond:     By that logic Deandre Jordan on the Clippers was a superior player to any player you can come up with within 10 seconds."
He seems like he's gonna be a great value DeAndre Jordan which is perfect for a number 3 guy on a contender.
"Chris Paul came in 5th in MVP voting this year and 7th last year. His first season in Houston was absolutely monstrous and got overlooked because Harden was the MVP that season. All CP's Clipper seasons were mint, he was definitively top ten then. He got DeAndre Jordan paid a lot of money when DJ for a long time didn't know where to stand on the court or to do anything with a basketball in his hands unless he was directly under the rim and completely open (and even then it was struggle). The guy was able to lead a top NBA offense without any 3 and D guys on the team, and Redick as his only shooters.    He is an absolute monster, and I know it's not the best circumstances, but I'm so happy he is in the Finals and has a chance at becoming a Champion."
Two way? Ayton is DeAndre Jordan on offense my guy
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, so four?"
"Yeah, to me how much credit lies in CP3 as the floor general. I think it’s too early to tell. I do think that Deandre Ayton will be better than DeAndre Jordan when it’s all said and done though."
"Yeah, I agree with you. He's also playing alongside one of the best point guards in Chris Paul. DeAndre Jordan didn't fare too well post-Lob City.    Too early to speculate due to recency bias."
not HOF but deandre jordan
So you posted a tweet meme that’s literally not relevant. Like zero relation to anything being said. Mark Cuban and Deandre Jordan have ZERO relevance to an injured Jamal Murray. And your zero effort reference to that tired tweet is funny to you? Be my guest but it’s been a tired tweet for years now and you added nothing new to the conversation.
"time and time again proves that you don't pay a rim running center that much money. Steven Adams, DeAndre Jordan. I let him walk, Mobley will likely be better and cheaper for the first 4 years"
"You are totally spot-on about spacing+rulebook. But that also points to ANOTHER flaw in analytics. Reliance on eFG% and TS% is also heavily flawed. Guys like Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert and now Daniel Gafford have over-inflated metric values offensively bc their shot diet is almost exclusively assisted restricted area buckets (to varying degrees, of course).  The point is that championship teams know how to win in any context, and that includes ugly. Teams and players that always try to dominate on schedule end up getting sent home come playoff time, when there are bound to be times the opponent makes the game ugly for you."
"Apparently the NBA only requires 20 FGM to qualify for the single playoff FG% leaderboard - so Daniel Gafford and his 84.6% (on 22 FGM) this year is going to shatter the official record, lol.  Bumping that up to 50 FGM gives you Gobert this year at #1 (74.1%) and DeAndre Jordan in 2015 at #2 (71.6%) ahead of Ayton.  Up it to 100 FGM and now Ayton is #1 *by far* - 71.1%, while #2 is only 62.2% (1985 James Worthy).  Since there was talk of guys like Shaq, let's add a 10 FGM per game qualifier to that as well. Probably not too surprising, the top 4 are Hakeem (61.5%), Shaq (61.2%), Kareem (60.7%), and Shaq again (60.6%) before it drops off to ~57% range. Shoutout to Kawhi this year at #6 (57.3%), the only one in the top 10 from the 2000's and on."
DeAndre Ayton &gt; Deandre Jordan
"He isn't like Deandre Jordan or Gobert - he does have post moves and OCCASIONALLY scores outside the paint.  He's had a few jumpers, one (lol) drive, and a whole bunch of post action. It isn't just catching lobs like you would expect from a big man with this record."
Deandre Anton &gt; Michael Jordan
"I agree Nets are the best place for him. But he will still hurt them offensively if he gets real playing time. It would be funny seeing Harden drive, collapse the defense, and dump it off to a wide open Drummond only for him to miss open dunks. The guy is a downgrade from Deandre Jordan."
DeAndre Ayton &gt; DeAndre Jordan
Personally I feel he made Deandre Jordan and Blake would’ve never been in MVP talks. He’s overpaid now and about a year or 2 from retiring but if those weren’t issues bring him back
Ayton = DeAndre Jordan with better touch
"I'm waiting for the ""DeAndre ayton is the first to score 25 points with 75% fg 12 reb and 4 blocks in the second game of a final series since Michael Jordan, who also had like 9 steals that game or whatever"""
If Ayton didnt have CP3 he would be looked at as DeAndre Jordan 2.0 this playoffs
"hey, that's three time all NBA and two time all defensive team DeAndre Jordan lmao I still can't believe he was a first team all NBA player."
This year is CP3’s reward for wasting his time trying to mentor DeAndre Jordan all those years
"You telling me that the Lob City Clippers, the 2018 and 2019 Rockets and this year's Suns were less talented than Malone? He had a top 5 player in Harden in 2018 and 2019, Blake and DeAndre Jordan were All-NBA for multiple years. (Whether or not they were top 15 is debatable)  Maybe if he didn't force a trade in every single team he was in and leave in free agency, the teams he was in would be in better position to make moves."
All NBA center Deandre Jordan is easily the most impressive award CP3 ever accomplished
Harden sometimes had DeAndre Jordan look like he was a worthwhile player in 2021.  He also made Kenneth Faried look serviceable in 2019
"none of those players looked better than they were, although deandre jordan got the worst 1st team selection ive ever seen"
Deandre Ayton and DeAndre Jordan both alley-oop with Chris Paul?   Deandre Ayton and Michael Jordan both win NBA Finals Game 1 in Phoenix!
"He’s a way more offensively skilled DeAndre Jordan at this point. Serves a very similar role for CP3 as DJ did back with the Clippers. He’s only 22, so he still has plenty of time to develop even more. I would caution anyone that says he’s a star, but also anyone that says he’s close to his ceiling."
"There's definitely recency bias, but what this shows is his potential.  I've been seriously impressed with his growth in these playoffs, and I can't wait to watch him with more off-seasons under his belt to work on generating his own offense. It's way too early to make a judgement call one way or the other. I.e. a glorified Deandre Jordan or a poor mans Tim Duncan (see earlier point about him needing more off-seasons).  Tl;dr = He's 22 and showing potential."
Lmao I remember him letting DeAndre Jordan get his 20th rebound  https://gfycat.com/IdealisticOpulentElectriceel
What’s great with Ayton is that he won’t force a dunk. Dude has the soft touch Deandre Jordan could’ve had.
Remind me of his clipper days with DeAndre Jordan.
DeAndre Jordan was great in the regular season. His true shooting percentage was 73.6%. This isn't some washed up scrub
Ben should consult whoever taught Deandre Jordan to shoot Free Throws
how is DeAndre Jordan still on their books for 2 more seasons?????
I’m just saying you can value things differently besides raw stats.. would steph curry have made deandre Jordan a highlight reel?
"Ben Simmons has worse touch than Rudy Gobert, DeAndre Jordan and similar rim running centers.   Anyone would call you crazy if you said Gobert and DeAndre will fix their jumper and they actually shoot with the proper hand. Why would anyone think its logical that Simmons can fix his jumper when nobody expects those other rim running centers to?  He will never ever be a passable shooter. He needs to focus on becoming a center full time and hitting 65% of his free throws. Hopefully its not in Philly. Cant stand watching him."
"&gt; DeAndre Jordan, DeMarcus 'Boogie' Cousins, DeMar Derozan and possibly 3 other players went out on the town Wednesday night in Rio and strolled into Termas Monte Carlo ... which Rolling Stone called 'one of the high end brothels in Rio.'""  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carmelo-anthony-talks-about-alleged-accidental-us-basketball-brothel-visit/"
"The year prior DeAndre Jordan was a NY Knick and would have given them info on how the org is run.  But KD literally once cited the black jerseys as a reason he joined, so it might not be that complicated.  &gt;New York City was the Mecca of basketball, and KD wanted to live there.

"wait, Jordan brand isn't DeAndre Jordan's?"
😭 DeAndre Jordan WASHED!! say it again for the people in the back!
"Absolutely.  &gt;The veteran Blake Griffin has officially signed for the Brooklyn Nets. This mid-season trade is expected to be the hottest news as of now. However, the team is aggressively pursuing free-agents. DeAndre Jordan has finally reunited with Blake Griffin since Los Angeles Clippers’ days. Veteran Blake Griffin said that it was not DeAndre Jordan who recruited him the most to join Brooklyn Nets rather it was Kevin Durant.   &gt;   &gt;Since the trade a lot of teams including the Philadelphia 76ers have expressed their opinions. This is a clear warning that the team is making a title contending squad. Blake Griffin recently met with head coach Steve Nash. Griffin said that KD was mostly in touch with him. He said, “I talked to KD the most,” he said. “I’ve known James, KD, Kyrie, and DeAndre for a long time, so this is a familiar team for me.”  He's very good friends with Irving too. I'm assuming the Team USA had some factor into that."
"The answer's in the quote; they didn't want a conventional head coach - they wanted someone in that position that would let them mostly do what they want. Harden wants to play 41 minutes in a blowout win against Houston? Alright, go for it. You want DeAndre Jordan to start all season? Fine, go ahead."
James Harden  Trevor Ariza  Jae Crowder  DeAndre Jordan
and DeAndre Jordan
I mean Kyrie signed there because he has a connection to the team. KD signed there because of Kyrie. Harden forced his way out of Houston to get there because of Kyrie and KD. What credit am I supposed to give to Brooklyn here? Having money to throw at shitty contracts like deandre jordan to appease the stars that chose to join up there?
Chris Paul got to the finals with Booker and Ayton but not DeAndre Jordan and Blake.  That's all you need to know about Blake.
"When DeAndre Jordan won his gold medal, this subreddit took a shit on him for say something along the lines of how much it means compared to winning the NBA championship.  This guy does it and everyone praises him."
Bruh if you read I said his body which is 6’11 240 lbs and even then there were athletic bigs with no where near the ball handling coordination or playmaking that he offers like Javale Mcgee Deandre Jordan Andre Drummond who are all 7ft and athletic
DeAndre Jordan was never better than Cousins
"The list I’m going from is “best careers” so still active young guys aren’t rated very high yet. It doesn’t really evaluate peaks or potential. Obviously I’d take Luka over DeAndre Jordan any day if I was starting a team, but if Luka never played another game (which is how this operates), I don’t know how you’d rate him in terms of “greatest careers.”"
Call me crazy but current Capela is just as good as All NBA Deandre Jordan
"Yeah now I realize I was just making that assumption, but now I see Wilkins is on there twice so I was wrong. I guess I thought no one in their right mind would have Deandre Jordan over Luka."
You're not being misunderstood and nobody is calling him a bum. He's not comparable to Jokic and Embiid while the dude was playing when the center position was at its weakest. We had DeAndre Jordan make multiple all nba teams during that time period for god sake.
Deandre Jordan was all-NBA. Kind of says it all.
"&gt;Cousins was just as good offensively and better on defense  lmfao. How in the fuck was he just as good offensively? Efficiency not in the same universe even as Jokic's least efficient season, passing not comparable, double the turnovers. Pick any advanced stat as well, even rookie Jokic blows any Cousins season out of the water (you know, when he played with great players like Mudiay and Jameer Nelson's corpse). Dude's competition for All-NBA teams were Deandre Jordan, Andre Drummond and Marc Gasol and he has a total of two all-nba teams and you're claiming he'd be an MVP candidate. Even when he was ""the best center in the league"", half the people would've rather had Marc Gasol because he was actually useful at things other than chucking shots"
I thought DeAndre Jordan is on the nets?
Deandre Jordan. Specifically lob city days with cp3.
"DeAndre Jordan did something similar to a defender, not sure if it was on the Clippers or Knicks."
Missed opportunity by DJ…shoulda made [this face](https://www.google.com/search?q=deandre+jordan+dunk+face+gif&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS896US896&amp;oq=deandre+jordna+dun&amp;aqs=chrome.5.69i57j0i13l5.6128j1j4&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8#imgrc=mK2X5Jz8ODeqgM)…he fake as hell
"For what it's worth (against most of the comments in this thread), DeAndre Jordan played a good chunk of his career before the 3-point revolution."
"he's great at:  -drafting guards (dame, cj, etc)  -drafting in the 2nd round (crabbe, trent jr, didn't he draft deandre jordan?)  he's good at:   -making small improvement trades (the nurk trade which ended up being a steal, rodney hood)  -min/MLE FA signings (i think? not invested enough to look at past history lol but seth curry/kanter/melo were all great pickups)   he's awful at big FA signings, big trades, and apparently fucking PR, and he's way too loyal to 'his guys' e.g. billups, older players he's drafted (like bringing in old players he's drafted or paying too much to retain players), etc  should have been fired for sure though"
"Kenny did a fantastic job with the team they had the year before they came. I understand as a franchise you gotta do what you gotta do and bend over backwards for players like KD especially when you’re not exactly an established team;  but man that, and pushing them to bench a great young player like JA coming off a breakout year for washed up Deandre Jordan really left a bad taste in my mouth. Championships are the ultimate cleanser though so if they win no one will care."
"I think the counter is that allows players like Joe Johnson, who are good players but just don’t really pass the smell test for being a hall of famer.  Doesn’t that really dilute whether it means anything at all?   I would argue if Joe Johnson is a hall of famer, players that just prob shouldn’t be in there are a candidate: deandre Jordan? Heck even jrue holiday which in my opinion shouldn’t even sniff it, but isn’t he a better player than Joe Johnson?...amare stoudamire? The list of players just goes on and on when we dilute it like that."
"I could see us nabbing some great players like Meyers Leonard, Dario Saric, and DeAndre Jordan. Ah the dream team."

He's like if prime Deandre Jordan could shoot instead of jump 40 inches.
"Everyone is pretty much saying Dwight and I agree.  I just want to add something in light of the effectiveness of small ball this playoffs and recognising that a lot of people on here probably didn't see prime Dwight.   Small ball only works when the bigs cannot punish the smaller players guarding them. It's why Rudy was so ineffective against the Clippers, and why Ayton has been dominating. The former cannot punish smaller guys, and the latter can.  I just want it known that when people say Dwight had no post-moves they don't mean he couldn't score in the post. Yes, it wasn't fancy but he was still more skilled in the post than most big men today. This man dominated inside. If he got deep position it was over. If he got a smaller guy on him it was over. It bothers me that a lot of newer fans seem to think he played like Clint Capela or DeAndre Jordan.   He probably should have played more PnR in his prime (blame Shaq for that one), but he was much better in the post before back surgery as well."
"The Los Angeles Clippers had a pretty toxic atmosphere at that time. CP3, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and had the head coach of the Boston boys club himself - Doc Rivers"
"That doesn't mean he was a good shooter. DeAndre Jordan is at 64% TS for his career and Barkley was 61%, it doesn't mean they were good shooter either."
I'm almost sure CP is plant based but I think DeAndre Jordan is vegan in full.
"Well, once DeAndre Jordan went vegan he turned to complete ass.   I think we shouldn't reach any conclusions."
"Doc's record should be good, he coached T-mac, KG, Pierce, Rondo, Ray Allen, Chris Paul, Shaq, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, etc.   This doesn't mean he's good, a little bit of smoke and mirrors in those numbers IMO."
I would agree if we didn’t already have proof of cp3 making centers better than what they really are. For example Deandre Jordan

Someone post the gif of CP3 jumping on DeAndre Jordan begging him to dunk the ball
"&gt;Simmons is top 5 in assists over the last 3 years and him and Embiid are the #1 duo for assists, but yeah Simmons isn’t an elite playmaker, lol. Playmaking is literally his best offensive trait, a dude who is a multiple time allstar and was 3rd team all nba last year. So by your logic, because he can’t shoot... he isn’t a playmaker? That’s not how that works, not at all. Embiid was a horrible example.   He's not because you keep referring to counting stats and accolades and not how their offence operates. They have consistently gotten by on their defence and not offence (this year they were 12th in offencive rating despite being the #1 seed). They failed each year to advance in the playoffs because Simmons can't breakdown the defence in the halfcourt setting.   &gt;Booker is a better playmaker than Murray, but Murray is still a far better playmaker than most players in the NBA. So again, to say Ayton is only good because he plays next to Booker is just dumb as shit.   Okay? What is the argument here?    &gt;Yep, because I’m a fan of him. I do enjoy defending one of my favorite players against people who clearly have no idea what they’re talking about. Quite a bit different than having a hate boner for a player to the degree you do. I don’t even think Ayton is top 3, but he’s 4th and undeniably top 5 by age 22. Bro... you think... Deandre Jordan took less “spoonfed and created-for-him” shots... because he was a bad free throw shooter? If they were truly spoonfed shots, why the fuck wouldn’t he be shooting them, regardless of how he shoots at the line??????? There is a massive dissonance here that is clear as day in numerous ways, yet you chose to dig yourself deeper.   Because teams would rather hack DJ than hack Ayton who is a better FT shooter? What is your logic here.   &gt;Telling me about NBA centers is hilarious when you clearly don’t know the basics of the center position, what skills are useful, and what skills are extra. I’ve watched no less than 50 hakeem games in my life, I’d recommend you go watch Hakeem when he was at the university of Houston (age 21). Ayton is way, way closer to that than he is Deandre Jordan... especially considering the fact that he’s already better than Jordan was at his peak. Calling the player who is having the most efficient postseason run in NBA history while doing it on 16 ppg at age 22 subpar offensively is so brain dead it hurts. Like next level stupid, one of the worst basketball takes I’ve ever heard. I pray I remember these comments just so I can relentlessly expose you in years to come.  And how is he closer? He can't fadeaway, he has trouble catching passes that aren't lobs and his footwork is weak."

"&gt;You said elite guard. Is Simmons not an elite playmaker who is also a guard?????? This isn’t this difficult, you’re just digging deeper for no reason at all.   He's not an elite playmaker because he can't run a halfcourt offence and he can't run the p&amp;p because he can't shoot. Isn't that obvious?  &gt;Bro, the goalpost shifting is crazy. You said elite playmaking guards in reference to Booker, who is more of a traditional shooting guard than Murray is.  Because he has the size to play the 2 but Booker is a much better playmaker due to being forced to develop his playmaking because the Suns refused to pair him with a good PG for the longest while.  &gt;Yes, getting into arguments almost daily and commenting on positive takes everywhere on /new for weeks is about as clear of a hate boner as it gets. KAT fans been feeling hella insecure recently, kinda wild since Ayton fans aren’t even really bringing up KAT. He “creates” a lot of those other looks too, there is a reason he gets more looks like that than any other center in the league. Rim rolling and finding the soft spot in the defense is indeed a skill, even though you clearly don’t know that. There’s a reason he’s averaging almost double the fga of Deandre Jordan, who was arguably the greatest lob catcher of all time playing with PRIME cp3.   I mean you are here in the trenches defending your boy and you want to call me out on it? Anyone who says that Ayton isn't a top 3 C in the league is met with you people. And do you know why he averages double the FGA attempts? because DAJ was a shit FT shooter and was hacked constantly as opposed to Ayton who averages a grand total of 2 FTA.  &gt;No, I don’t think he would, and yes we actually have seen him create more shots for himself. This isn’t a hypothetical “can he,” we actually have seen it in countless real games. He literally created most of his looks his rookie year, even if they were assisted. Forcing post touches in a 0.5 offense slows down ball movement and can slow/clog-up off ball motion, which is kind of the exact opposite of the point of the 0.5 offense. And our offense is top 5 in the league and in the finals without doing that, so why do that? I know these types of nuances can be tough, but I would also think someone wouldn’t be commenting 100 times a week about a single player if they didn’t know these things.  I suggest you go and watch any of the all NBA C's play to see the difference  between them and Ayton. Your boy is closer to DAJ than he is to Hakeem and no matter how much your fanbase wants to speak it into existence his subpar offensive game is just that subpar."
"He averaged 2 more points a game on 2% worse TS? You really milking the hell out of that. You’re really, really, REALLY stretching to make points here if you think Ayton wouldn’t have preferred Teague over a washed version of one of the most notoriously selfish offensive players in NBA history.   You said elite guard. Is Simmons not an elite playmaker who is also a guard?????? This isn’t this difficult, you’re just digging deeper for no reason at all.   Bro, the goalpost shifting is crazy.

I mean DeAndre Jordan and Tyson Chandler basically did nothing but catch lobs (many of those also coming from CP3) and didn't manage Ayton's efficiency during any of their playoff runs.   What Ayton is doing is incredibly impressive. The fact that his touches are coming close to the rim doesn't make them easy looks.
"He’s doing it on almost double the fga per game of DeAndre Jordan, probably the greatest lob catcher in NBA history.   This is a really dumb take that lacks basic basketball knowledge"
\&gt; CP3 played on a team based around lobbing  Neither DeAndre Jordan or Blake Griffin even in his prime has ever been a reliable a target as Karl Malone. There is also a large disparity in minutes played and general availability due to health and more rest given in the league on average.  \&gt; Tony Parker played with Duncan  Spurs style of basketball was way different. No one on the Spurs ever averaged a lot of assists during that reign because of the way they moved the ball around no one person racked them up ton. They didn't sit there and feed Duncan all game from one playmaker.
Mavs have had a “serious chance” to lure Joe many max FA’s away? And the closest they’ve come so far is *almost* DeAndre Jordan?
Exactly it’s to the point that people are actually overrating  DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan too
"Chris Paul will be an NBA champion before Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden"
"Apart from it’s more embarrassing to most guys than air-balling, he’s actually gotten better. Both Dwight Howard and Deandre Jordan were TERRIBLE free throw shooters. I mean the WORST.  But they actually dramatically improved the last 2 or so seasons so it’s not impossible to figure out the timing, or the specific shot on the free throw line that works best for them.  Now… Ben Simmons on the other hand, 👵🏻…"
"&gt; KAT or DeAndre Jordan  pretty much the same players, right?"
Bundle him with Kuzma for  a proper big man like   KAT or   DeAndre Jordan.
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"

DeAndre Jordan would average the same numbers in the same era is one of my favorite hot takes
Sorry thought we were speaking of Deandre Jordan.
Deandre Jordan made first team all-nba in 2016. So yeah thats gotta be the weakest center era.
I’ll give you Deandre Jordan and some picks
It was definitely the [Clippers who locked DeAndre Jordan in a room with them.](https://www.clipsnation.com/2015/7/8/8917489/the-clippers-have-been-inside-deandre-jordans-house-all-day-with-mark) with the Mavs being locked out and Cuban begging (thru texts).
Watch the series. He handled a huge load on defense when someone like DeAndre Jordan wouldve gotten schooled.
Do you have idea why a sign and trade is done?  Kd could have gone for free. Nets wanted to clear cap space for Deandre jordan so we got back Dlo which is great value in a sign and trade.
"Man is 6’11” with a 7’8” wingspan and is relatively athletic, those are some measurables 🥵  I know it’s only NAIA but his tape looks like a young DeAndre Jordan"
Yeah because DeAndre Jordan is going to stop Westbrook Davis and Lebron from running a layup line
"Jeff Teague, Iguodala, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond. All-star lineup."
Counter offer: DeAndre Jordan + ~~salary filler~~ a subway pass
"By my count, in his first 4 seasons he'll have played with 13 all stars: Simmons, Embiid, Butler, Kawhi, Paul George, Kyrie, Durant, Harden, Blake Griffin, Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Chris Paul, Booker. Even excluding the couple has-beens that's amazing"
"Shamet has played for four different teams in his first four years.  He has played with Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Devin Booker, and possibly Chris Paul."
He obviously means DeAndre Jordan
The total only has to match $28m; it doesn’t have to be $28m to dinwiddie. Could be $18m to dinwiddie and Deandre Jordan.  Still probably better trade offers out there but it’s not as bad as maxing Dinwiddie.
"That was not a great time for Center as far as talent goes. Gobert hadn't really come into his own, KAT, Embiid, Jokic were all still just starting out, Ayton, was still a teenager, Capela wasn't the player he is today.  It was a race between Boogie, Marc, Deandre Jordan and Brooks Lopez for who the best center in the league was, the talent pool around center just wasn't as deep."
Mavs pursuit of Deandre Jordan. They were trying very hard to sign him but then the Clippers teammates crashed his house to convince him to stay.  The chair was uploaded as a joke saying the Clippers were barricading the house so Mark Cuban couldn’t bust in.  It was the same summer as the great emoji war
A chaotic free agency decision involving Deandre Jordan and some other Clippers folks.
DeAndre Jordan.
Cuban bought a battering ram after Deandre Jordan was locked in his house. He finally gets to use it now
Deandre Jordan... oh wait

Once DeAndre Jordan broke out he was good even when CP3 didn't play.  [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/deandre-jordan-on-the-clippers-after-2013-without-chris-paul](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/deandre-jordan-on-the-clippers-after-2013-without-chris-paul)  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/deandre-jordan-on-the-clippers-after-2013-with-chris-paul  CP3 definitely helped him (see the efficiency boost) but the pervasive idea around here that all he did was catch lobs from the Point God and couldn't play otherwise just doesn't hold up under scrutiny.
"Deandre Jordan is actually more like Rudy Gobert, worse defense, cooler dunks."
"Ayton averaged over 18ppg in 2019/20 before CP3,   Capela and especially DeAndre Jordan were nothing before CP3"
Ayton has a jumpshot and can defend well on the perimeter.  DeAndre Jordan can’t shoot at all and gets destroyed on the perimeter.  Just say you haven’t watched Ayton play before making an idiotic post like this
"They won't be the 2 seed? Who's going to be better than them in the regular season? The Jazz can't play any better than they have been with what they have, the Nuggets MAYBE, the Lakers MAYBE if they stay healthy, Clips don't have Kawhi all year, we have no idea what Klay's going to be like, first of all.  And second of all  &gt;not just a really good DeAndre Jordan   This is the biggest steaming pile of donkey shit take I've seen on here all week. I'm not even going to dignify you with any further response or analytics on this."
"Both. They won't be the 2 seed imo and they won't make the finals obviously, baring Ayton becoming actually great and not just a really good DeAndre Jordan."
"I sort of connect to him as I too am taller than everyone and also only good because of it. And especially when playing at better courts, unlike some shitty point guard, if i miss or turnover my first shot or two im not getting the ball anymore, while ofc the shitty point guard will continue chucking threes, since hes the one with the ball in the first place.  In my opinion its not confidence in yourself thats important, its confidence of others in yourself. I know im good and i know i make the team better just by standing near the basket. But if you're not confident in my skills and relegate me to being the white DeAndre jordan when im better than that, im just not going to play as well. I see the same in him. ""He's too slow, don't play him"", "" he cant guard threes, dont play him"". So yes i will always have a place in my heart for mr roy. Fuck small ball and fuck those short and fat analysts with their stats and steph curry for making everyone think its ok to go 2/7 from three in a 3v3 game."
"Joe Harris, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan when KD was out"
"This is what happens when you're a sharp shooter who played with prime Dwight Howard, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, and Joel Embiid"
"Sans-Utah Reggie was like a 35% 3 point shooter in the playoffs. *Passable* is the word to describe his shooting, contrast that with DeRozan who just isnt particularly interested in 3 pointers for himself, and to his credit he hasnt needed it. Demar has been a 20 ppg scorer at 60% TS the last 2 years *without* the 3. He's plenty efficient on offense. And he just clocked his most efficient season as a distributor as well and there are a lot of ways a wing can exist to space the floor without a spot up jumper. Like Jimmy doesn't shoot 3s well either but he still spaces the floor on and off the ball because he distributes the ball when he has it and cuts when he doesn't.  We have 5 guys who shot over 40% this last season from 3 who're currently slated to come back (and then Cousins and Reggie). Some of that is gonna regress next year (and I believe Reggie is a prime regression candidate, I'd love for him to prove me wrong but he had a career year last season) but imho you have room to have 1 non shooter on the floor if that non shooter is useful to your offense in other ways as a vertical spacer (Capela, lob city era DeAndre Jordan, Giannis, Daniel Gafford, Zion, etc) or as a distributor (Jimmy, DeRozan, etc)"
deandre jordan is the goat
"I mean tbf, cp3 also had blake griffin deandre jordan and jj reddick, problem was him and blake were made of glass lol"
"Tobey dives really well to the basket off the pick and roll; when we played the Lakers with AD playing, doubling Luka made Dwight Powell look like prime Deandre Jordan. Like, doubling can work at times but it will not work once Luka figures it out"
We need a Dwight/Tyson Chandler/Deandre Jordan on this team tbh. Just one dude to be physical down low.
"Randle would be an awful fit for this team. Undersized and ball dominant. Not a great shooter or defender. Love was an awful decision (only remote benefit is his shooting) but that doesn't mean Randle would have been a good choice.   A prime DeAndre Jordan is what we need. Defend, board and finish around the rim not needing the ball in their hands. McGee kinda fits that but I agree it's embarrassing that an Olympic squad has a player of his caliber considering it's America.   We should have reached out to Brook Lopez or someone like that instead."
Knicks legend Deandre Jordan
"I should rephrase my opinion. I believe on the clippers Chris Paul had overall better teammates then Stockton. I believe Deandre Jordan, Blake griffin, the sixth man of the year, some great three point specialists.   The more I think of it. I am wrong because clippers never were healthy. Yeah Chris Paul is better."
well sir a long time ago they got this guy named deandre jordan about 5 years late
DeAndre Jordan the 2nd time he choose to signed with them right?
I think all NBA centers is easier to get on than forwards. Hell DeAndre Jordan was first team all NBA
"&gt;who was the last great American big man  All-NBA first team legend, DeAndre Jordan. Maybe prime Minnesota K-Love had a shout here"
Let's bring in DeAndre Jordan
USA in a bit of trouble when you start thinking Andre Drummond or Deandre Jordan would help this team out.
"""top 3"" So..... Zion, Ja, and Jordan Poole? For reference, this ranks Jordan Poole above: RJ Barret, Deandre Hunter, Darius Garland, and Tyler Herro. Those four are ***definitely*** above Poole, and most would have talents like KPJ and Keldon Johnson ahead of him too."
"Blake Griffin and Lob City, was in college at the time and cardio is boring af, until I caught a Clipper game.   Watching Blake Griffin dunk on everyone was the most entertaining thing ever. Became a Clips fan then and there. Also I forget on who but Deandre Jordan dunked on someone so hard I stopped jogging and just left the gym after that. Like, it was the nastiest dunk I’ve ever seen in my life. Full cockback and just YAMMED it."
DeAndre Jordan
"Compared to harden, Westbrook, Blake, deandre Jordan, booker etc Malone is better but Chris Paul has had multiple great teammates at the same time. And also better benches."
"Second half of the lottery probably?   Zion, Ja, Barrett, and Garland would be top 4.  The rest of the lottery would probably be (in some order): DeAndre Hunter, Coby White, Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Matisse Thybulle, Cam Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Rui Hachimura. Maybe throw in Gafford or Clarke or Reddish or someone else instead.  Pretty weak draft so far, looking back on it."
DeAndre Jordan lol
You're pretty high on Deandre Jordan.
I think the comment you're replying to is being sarcastic haha. Re: DeAndre Jordan 2017-2019.
"Joe Harris, the best 3 point shooter in the nba by %.  Blake Griffin &amp; Deandre Jordan, former all-nba players.  Jeff Green &amp; Landry Shamet, starters for other contenders. Bench players for the Nets."
"Well, Blake Griffin is a 6x all star, 3x All-NBA second team, and 2x All-NBA player.   Deandre Jordan is a first team All-NBA player, 2x third team and 2x all-defense.   Not to mention, multiple time sixth man Jamal Crawford, Austin Rivers, JJ Redick.   That wasn’t just “every team in the west” caliber back in say 2015. That was a stacked team. If the argument is that “CP can’t win with those cats” isn’t that more so on Chris Paul? 🤷🏻‍♂️ I don’t know"
Do you see where it says Blake Griffin -and- Deandre Jordan?
"Well, earlier in the conversation I said Griffin and Deandre Jordan. I was making the point that Chris Paul had played on extremely talented teams. Obviously i’m not saying Blake Griffin was as good as Kawhi, but Griffin was a damn good basketball player on the Clippers and the team had talent in spades"
Yeah it’s not like Chris Paul had multiple opportunities at championships with Prime Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan or James Harden
Deandre Jordan is a 3X All-NBA player
Might be unpopular but Ayton stock didn’t rise for me. It just exposed his lack of offensive game and we all know AD was eating Ayton’s lunch before his injury. Still young though so we’ll see if he adds anything or follows the DeAndre Jordan career path.
"You’re acting like our fan base thinks our young guys are superstars. It’s possible to be high on young guys and also have them not be quite ready to play winning basketball as a main option on a team. Those things aren’t mutually exclusive.   Curry missed 9 games and we went 1-8 during that stretch. Oubre was terrible all year. Jordan Poole looked like he belonged on the Shanghai Sharks the first half of the season. When curry got back, oubre was out, and Poole hit his stride we were actually a good team. That’s the sample size that fans are referring to, not the entire season as a whole because the first half of the year was a shit show.  As for Wiggins, nobody is saying he’s a superstar either it’s more that the narrative on him has changed because he’s become a legitimate lockdown defender. In minnesota he was always known for completely disappearing for games at a time. He’s turned it around and when he’s not clicking on offense he’s still contributing by locking up his guy.   And for wiseman, I haven’t seen any of our fans saying he’s legitimately good yet. But the ones who are fans of him see the flashes of things that very few other bigs can do and realize he’s super young and had some bad luck this year from covid to freak injuries. I’m not sure if he’ll be good, but saying he has the potential to be at least deandre ayton is not overrating him at all. He’s got the tools.   That said though, I think ayton is a poor player comp for him. Not that he can’t be as good or better than ayton, but his game is much more Chris bosh than deandre ayton."
Stats might look good but the guy needs to learn how to catch the ball and finish with force. He’s filling the roll of a deandre Jordan right now and he can be so much more.
"&gt;Damn, that’s wild that Deandre Jordan averaged 1.7 less ppg than his career high ppgon better efficiency at age 30 in Dallas than he did in his prime with a prime CP3 passing to him  He went from CP3 to Luka lmao and if you're looking at the jump in ts%, he increased his ft%. His fg% was never higher than his years with CP3.   &gt;And who could forget about Tyson Chandler’s massive drop off when he left Jason Kidd to join the guard duo of Iman Shumpert and JR Smith... where he raised his scoring to his second best in his career on much higher efficiency.  Wasn't this the Linsanity year?"
"Damn, that’s wild that Deandre Jordan averaged 1.7 less ppg than his career high ppg on better efficiency at age 30 in Dallas than he did in his prime with a prime CP3 passing to him. And who could forget about Tyson Chandler’s massive drop off when he left Jason Kidd to join the guard duo of Iman Shumpert and JR Smith... where he raised his scoring to his second best in his career on much higher efficiency."
I’d say Ayton averaging as good efficiency as Deandre Jordan on nearly double the fga per game is a good thing??? Who knew that getting more high efficiency shots was a good thing?
"They didnt take enough Field goals to qualify for this cherry picked stat. DeAndre Jordan averaged 13/13 on 72 FG% in 2015. Hell, for his career he nearly averages a double double on 66% shooting in the playoffs"
Then why didn’t someone like Deandre Jordan or Clint Cappella do this first?
"I think people sometimes put too much weight on numbers and accomplishments than the context in which they occurred.  For example: Malone and Barkley lost to Jordan in the finals.  Everybody lost to Jordan in the finals.  If they had lost to the Knicks and Patrick Ewing, they'd have the same numbers (meaning: 0 rings) but they'd probably be less respected than they are now.  Now the story is: they got beaten by Jordan.  If it were the Knicks, the story would be ""they lost to Patrick Ewing"".  Barkley lost to Jordan. Well shit, who didn't?  Dirk beat Lebron, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Tough competition.  Giannis beat an old Chris Paul and a young Devin Booker and a young Deandre Ayton. I love the fact that Giannis won, but I'm not sure if 10 years from now we still think he went up against a really tough opponent.  Then again, Giannis might have a few more rings a few more years from now and that changes the story completely.  My point is: it's just too soon to be making all these statements about where Giannis stacks up historically.  He's not even done yet."
"i think the stat that really opened my eyes about KAT is that he's 6th ALL TIME in ts%, which, don't get me wrong, is a list typically dominated by big men (DeAndre Jordan is the all time TS% leader), but typically big men don't launch up as many 3's a game as KAT"
Or joe Harris and  deandre Jordan xD
Brandon Ingram---&gt; Kevin Durant  Andre Roberson--&gt; Ben Simmons  Kevin Huerter---&gt;Larry Bird  Jamal Murray---&gt; Michael Jordan  Greg Oden--&gt; Deandre Ayton (actually Oden may be Ayton from the future)
Brandon Knight still alive? I thought DeAndre Jordan took him out lmao
"slight tangent, but it's still weird to me that CP3, Griffin, Deandre Jordan, JJ Redick, and Jamal Crawford never went that far with the Clips"
Ayton is pretty underwhelming. Dude looked like DeAndre Jordan on offense and got pushed around by the Bucks all series.

Daily Discussion Thread : [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/rules#wiki_daily_discussion_thread)"
It happens more often than you think  Clippers this year with Kawhi and PG  Rockets in 2019 with Harden and Westbrook  Jimmy Butler and Karl Towns in 2017-18  Clippers had 3 in 2014-15 with CP3 Blake and Deandre Jordan  Steph Draymond and Klay in 2016  It doesn't necessarily indicate being a super team.
you almost got DeAndre Jordan!!!
"Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan have been all stars more recently than Jrue Holiday, so by that logic KD had two all stars as well. Jeff Green had a better game than any game Jrue had in that series. Middleton wasn't even an all star this year either. Imagine talking about Giannis 'needing' anything in comparison to the dude that's only won after joining a 73-9 team lmao stop it"
I'm implying that big men with limited offensive skillsets can get overinflated FG% off not having to create shots @ deandre jordan during cp3-era
Shouldn't DeAndre Jordan be on here as well?
"I don't think people realize how agile and nimble Shaq was. He legit could cross people over not as a meme.   He wasn't dominant solely of his strength, if that was the case DeAndre Jordan would be HOFmer.   Shaqs technique was amazing."
I heard he also once tied up Deandre Jordan to a chair and forced him to re-sign with the Clips.
Michael and DeAndre Jordan?
Surprised CP3 didn’t yell at Ayton there like he did with DeAndre Jordan.
"No, I’m thinking of Jennings. Deandre Jordan dunking on him went viral."
"Define recent. Teague, Jrue, and Lopez have each only been selected once. Teague was the most recently selected of those 3 (2015, half a decade ago) and frankly he's by far the worst player in the Bucks rotation. Middleton did make it in 2019 and 2020, but didn't make it this year   The recent all-star thing doesn't make a ton of sense anyway. Is a team of Isaiah Thomas, Gordon Hayward, DeAndre Jordan, Julius Randle, and D'Angelo Russell a superteam?"
Mitchell Robinson  Rudy Gobert  DeAndre Jordan  Montrezl Harrell  Jerami Grant
he definitely was I didn't mean to insinuate he wasn't. I was just laughing at the money he got paid by being a klutch client even in the year before lebron got there. It was spoken about hush hush he was basically being a mole for klutch on how things were going behind the scenes at the lakers similar to DeAndre Jordan and KD with the Knicks. who knows if it's true
"21 is by far the worst team.  2 top ten players (dame/durant)  2 top 20 players (tatum/booker)  4 top 30 players (bam/jrue/khris/lavine)  and then there is Draymond, Javale, Grant, and Johnson  for reference 16 still had Lowry/Butler/George/Thompson/Irving/Durant/Draymond/Demar/Cousins as all top 30 players, and most of those are top 20.  And Harrison Barnes Carmelo Anthony and Deandre Jordan are better than Grant/Johnson/McGee."
Accurate. Make this an NBA team.  Trade: - Kyrie for Rubio - Harden for Doncic - DeAndre Jordan for Gobert  Welp can’t do it. Durant would veto the last one
"you’re right, his name isn’t jordan deandre, so don’t put him after MJ"
"If Jordan DeAndre existed, I'd add Ayton but its DeAndre Jordan so I had to edit."
It would need to be Jordan DeAndre
"Is he supposed to be bad? Guy was a niche player that absolutely dominated the paint with his size. Was Deandre Jordan ever any better?  but yeah, one of the best shot blockers ever is trash because players are more veratile now.."
I can already see that Cade is the type of dude that Deandre Jordan/Capela/AD would love to play with
Not sure if it tops Deandre Jordan but it's certainly the only time I've ever seen a man sit on another man's head and dunk over him.
"Bro.... no other team got played by somebody as lack luster as DeAndre Jordan. He fucked up a whole offseason cause we prioritized him and he wasn’t even *THAT* good to warrant it all tbh. lmao I think every since that debacle fans take getting turned down more to heart. It’s illogical, but fandom often is."
Man thats a bad race-baiting take. Mavs pursue basically any talent possible. They just always strike out &amp; have to settle. They literally had their season borderline ruined one year bc their #1 high profile African American FA in Deandre Jordan before he decided against it. Its pretty obviously not a race thing.
While I think this dunk is amazing I feel hardaway not hitting the floor takes away from it for some reason. My favorite dunk is the alley oop to deandre jordan that made Brandon knight wish he was never born
If you start at the end of '21 playoffs and play it backwards you can hear DeAndre Jordan reciting a recipe for Vegan Brownies.
what if he meant deandre jordan
"Nice *""Nuh uh""* response.   Shame ya'll didn't get DeAndre Jordan this offseason. Woulda been nice to have a 1st team All-NBA center on the roster now that Dwight left."
"Deandre Jordan murdered Brandon Knight, Gerald Wallace murdered, burried, set fire, and then nuked Boštjan Nachbar. Holy fucking shit."
A single highlight can't get you in c'mon. Is DeAndre Jordan getting in? You know exactly which dunk I'm talking about.
"For sure man.  Deandre Jordan was putting up supposedly putting up 1,000 free throws a day for a month or two in dallas. And had one of his better free throw shooting seasons the next season. And kept that trend the upcoming seasons. Can't say muscle memory doesn't work. Especially for high level athletes like these guys."
"I got the free throws wrong, and that's it, if I correctly account the free throws it goes from 45% to 36%. Literally ANYBODY can hit free throws beside Shaq Ben Simmons and DeAndre Jordan. Oh wait DeAndre improved. If you can't hit from the field you are either well defended or well cold."
"&gt;It just can’t happen in less than 60 seconds at all period.  We are talking plausible deniability. If during an investigation a team and their signing says they presented the offer and it was accepted immediately which is why the deal was closed in under a minute...Adam Silver is going to say ""No..no..that cant happen""?      &gt;Not to mention when we call something a “done deal” this implies signatures have happened  None of these FA signings that have been announced are ""done deals"" (im not sure about the sign and trades). They are all verbal agreements and nothing has been signed. Thats the reason why a couple of players have backed out of deals after they were announced e.g. DeAndre Jordan, Nemanja Bjelica, Yogi Ferrell"
"You just triggered all the kids with the skilled comment, because it’s true. The WNBA doesn’t have enough roster spots or a G-League to take on high potential athletic players. Most years not even all the first round draft picks make a roster. Hell it’s not unheard of for Lottery picks to be waived their second year. You basically contribute or get cut. Also, more skilled doesn’t mean that the W player would beat a NBA player. Obviously NBA players have more size and strength. More skill means they have more tools they can utilize. Elena Delle Donne, Breanna Stewart, and Candace Parker are more skilled than Javale McGhee, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond."
Bam.  Ayton is a rich mans DeAndre Jordan.
"Where are you going to set a minimum on attempts? DeAndre Jordan was at 129 TS+ this past year.  Brent Barry had a 129, a 127, and a 125 year when he was on the Supersonics, and McMillan just wasn't very interested in giving him the ball more.  For high volume Barkley had a 124 in a year he averaged 28PPG."
Deandre Jordan and Cousins thrived off of that rule during their Team USA runs back then too
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
My point is they got Harden+Irving primarily because of KD. I'm sure there were other options and free agents they could have gone after if not for KD. Even DeAndre Jordan was there because of KD. Can't bail on a franchise like that when they pretty much gave you everything you wanted.
Mark has been willing to spend money. The problem is the Mavs for the most luck has had bad luck when it comes to free agency. You remember that whole thing with DeAndre Jordan? That’s one of them.
DeAndre Jordan &amp; Brandon Knight  What did Brandon do to his family to deserve that?
Michael (Beasley) and (DeAndre) Jordan
"Yeah but Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, KD, Harden, and Kyrie with Lamarcus Aldridge possibly off the bench or starting is incredible also."
"That is true, but it's not like Brooklyn got no size. They have KD, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, and Claxton. Claxton could see a lot of minutes if they play the Lakers."
"What about last year's nets:  KD, Kyrie, Harden, Black Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Aldridge"
And what big FAs has Dallas signed lol? THJ? Deandre Jordan (lmao)? Have fun paying Porzingis for another 3 years lmao.
Didn't DeAndre Jordan go from a 40% FT shooter to 70%?  And there are plenty of people who came into the league with awful jump shots and developed a decent one. If they can do that with someone jumping to block them surely you can improve FTs
"Most ever is apparently 22 by Marcos Leite in 1971. Second most ever is 20 by three others, including Arvydas Sabonis.   Most by a USA player is 16 by Tim Duncan, DeAndre Jordan, and Jim Brewer."
"I was laughing my ass off when Capela got some light MVP buzz in 2016-17. Harden served up every bucket for him on a platter.   He has DeAndre Jordan vibes. Good defensively, good rebounder, but basically no offensive scoring outside of lob catches."
Imagine Doncic with someone like Deandre Jordan to lob it to
Cuz they done wanna play. It’s a world of difference from the old teams we had. You had leaders and people that know their role now it’s just stars it’s not gonna work. Previous teams had deandre Jordan javele Tyson chandler igoudala that were DOGS you got jrue dray and kd and well… that’s it lol. Bring some dogs it’s physical as hell And it’s gonna be tough. Where’s the heart. You need some oomph and youth in this team hell even use last years rookies lamelo literally has experience with these rules.
"The Nets are gonna be worse than they were this year. They very well might actually have to play Deandre Jordan at C this year, and at this stage of his career, you’re basically holding a “for sale” sign at the rim."
"i don't care how bad he is i will always mention deandre jordan when i tell my friends about how the nets formed a super team (they're casual fans, they think he's still at all star level)"
At least he was courteous   DeAndre Jordan on the other hand...
"""KD and Kyrie were unwilling to part ways with DeAndre Jordan..."""
Who else thought this was the DeAndre Jordan copypasta at first?
"The big 3 think they’re good enough as is even if   DeAndre Jordan doesn’t play in the play offs to win it all, they certainly got the talent for it so we’ll have to wait and see who they get at the trade deadline that may help"
It's not that way around - it's Kyrie/KD keeping DeAndre Jordan.
DeAndre Jordan 😤😤
"It's not Washington it's Brooklyn. If they take back any salary their luxury bill is ridiculous. They need to offload someone (aka DeAndre jordan), or they going to have to pay stupid amounts of money. P sure it's around a 4x per $ on tax for them cus how far they are in. So even someone like kuzma could cost them 40 million dollars extra in tax"
I think he'll finally get over DeAndre Jordan with another ring.
Nets about to turn Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan into Bradley Beal and Dame!
Maybe we’ll se what happens with deandre jordan?
"We'll give you Deandre Jordan and 2 tickets to the Intrepid Air &amp; Space Museum, final offer."
"CP3 has played with Harden, Blake and Booker. The Hall of Fame isnt that hard to get into if you have been multiple all star/ multiple All nba. I think Deandre Jordan might even get in down the line."
DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan pushing luka for the rebound lol
"its some hater just spewing pessimistic stuff. I can say the same thing about players like pj tucker, javale mgee, deandre jordan."
"After Shaq's decline, it was between Yao and Howard in '08.  Then Howard and Bynum maybe in '12. But after that we just stopped talking about centers. Marc Gasol here, Joakim Noah there. DeAndre Jordan lol.  Embiid and Jokic really brought back the center position to the modern game."
"The Trae thing isn't a new rule, it's just telling refs to stop blowing the whistle on those obvious foul bait moves, isn't it?  In terms of actual rules, didn't the ""hack-a"" rule get put in place relatively recently because of DeAndre Jordan (or what was being done to him)?"
Drummond's just 27 though. DeAndre Jordan is 33
Cool now show a video of deandre Jordan from 8 years ago. Can he do that stuff today?
"Deandre Jordan was an all-star in his prime too, I believe."
"Basically because it pretty much has to be a three team deal (either added on to the Russell Westbrook trade or a third team to take on Deandre Jordan) and the Nets want to be compensated for their role while the Wizards probably don't want to pay too much in draft capital or players for a FA signing, so all three teams have to be happy with the arrangement"
"Harris is a lot better than Patty, but if they could get an above average center it could be worth it. They drafted Day’Ron Sharpe but I doubt he'll be able to play in meaningful games, and Deandre Jordan is pretty much washed up."
Is Deandre Jordan the worst all nba first teamer?
"I mean, DeAndre Jordan still ended up on the Mavs lol  Crazier shit has happened"
Why would I just pretend that DeAndre Jordan wasn't on the team last year? Dude played more games than any of the big three.
"1. You're looking at the defense on the season. 2. Look at the defense when DeAndre Jordan was off the floor (he won't be in the rotation, maybe not even on the team this season). You'll be shocked."
At what point do the Lakers pray Caruso does a DeAndre Jordan?
Nets aren’t really old af.  James Harden: 31 - was an mvp candidate when healthy  Kevin Durant 32 - arguably best player in the league Kyrie - 29  All are 32 or younger and aren’t coming off a season where you question if they’re past their prime.  Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan are the only 2 who really fit that bill and Jordan doesn’t play.
Brooklyn can also send Deandre Jordan to OKC to help their lux tax situation since we can't remove the protections without there being some sort of transaction between all of us.
"According to this article: - Dame - Kyrie - CP3 - Javale McGee - DeAndre Jordan - Jahlil Okafor - Wilson Chandler  https://veganliftz.com/vegan-basketball-players/  Lewis Hamilton, the Williams twins and a number of MMA guys as well."
Cp3? Deandre jordan? I know im forgetting someone
"Lewis Hamilton. Cam Newton.  At one point on time, like 1/4 of the Tennessee Titans.  Venus Williams.  DeAndre Jordan.  Sami Zayn.  Brian Daniels.  Zelina Vega.  Walter (the pro wrestler) Pete Dunn CP3  And a lot of athletes eat plant based during the season,  like Messi, Sergio Aguero, Noval Djokovic, etc."
DeAndre Jordan
That's fine he's more mobile then Deandre Jordan.
"2021 Nets, Kd, Harden, Kyrie, LMA, Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Jeff Green"
"Wizards are working out a sign and trade for Dinwiddie. Just trying to get the pieces right with another team involved.  How about this? Let me know if anything needs to change and what you think?  Brooklyn Receive: Bertans &amp; Thad Young   OKC receive: DeAndre Jordan, 1 x WAS 2nd Rnd Pick  Wiz receives: Dinwiddie and Svi Mykhailuik  Chicago receives: Thomas Bryant, 2 x BKN 2nd Rnd Picks  Brooklyn gets two guys who help them make a push for a championship.  OKC gets Jordan who they could waive and get more cap flexibility plus the 2nd Round has a clause to get the better positioning of Was, Chicago, Lakers 2nd Rounders.  Wiz get their point guard in Dinwiddie and Svi to play hard off the bench.  Chicago gets a young big man who can help off the bench behind Vuce plus multiple second rounders that they can package for a trade later on.  Salaries work out and every team gets a benefit out of it."
"Unless Lakers S&amp;T for DeAndre Jordan, that's a pretty serious paycut where he won't get major mins"
"But you still have Wiseman, right? He's like DeAndre Ayton crossed with prime DeAndre Jordan crossed with prime Jordan Bell, right?"
"lebron locking caruso up [deandre jordan style](https://media.gq.com/photos/559e0b155f1c7af15a1ee8d4/master/w_1600,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202015-07-08%2520at%252010.47.43%2520PM.png)"
Shame you lost him but still have the ghost of DeAndre Jordan on that shit contract
For poor mans prime deandre jordan
This is Deandre Jordan all over again lol.
...but everyone on this sub will tell you Wilt was basically DeAndre Jordan playing against milkmen on their lunch break.
"It's crazy how many people are comparing 22 year-old, barely-getting-started Ayton to early-prime Capela and absolute-prime Deandre Jordan like it's bad that he's currently only slightly better than them."
"And Christ Paul last year made more money ($41,358,814) than he, Blake Griffin, and Deandre Jordan made combined in their first season together on the LA Clippers ($32,170,289)"
"I will say when you look back at the list of FA targets Dallas gets linked to targeting that they miss on, it’s usually a huge bullet dodged - Carmelo, Deron Williams, Dwight Howard, Deandre Jordan, etc. Those contracts usually wind up being awful."
"&gt; So wait, $9.5m for McConnell?  My god man, that's George Hill/Deandre Jordan/Serge Ibaka/Larry Nance/Jeremy Lamb money.  But really, I'm fine with it.  McConnell quickly became a favorite of mine."
"One thing about Deandre Jordan, he’s gonna secure that bag"
Is Deandre Jordan still under contract? I feel like that contract is never ending.
"The Mavs have signed Seth Curry, Wes Matthews, Deandre Jordan, tried to sign Dwight Howard, and traded for pieces like Tyson Chandler, Shawn Marion and Monta Ellis over the last few years. Not sure where the “European bias” is coming from other than his comments while he was riding the high from drafting Luka. Also not sure what you’re implying with the Montreal/Luka issue, that doesn’t connect to Cuban at all. Mavs got plenty of other things to criticize like how they hire coaches and front office staff"
"The Nets actually can do a S&amp;T, provided they lower their payroll and end the transaction below the apron.   Let’s say Kawhi is signed to a $38m AAV contract.   Joe Harris + Dinwiddie (signed anywhere beneath $20m AAV) + DeAndre Jordan meets this criteria.  So theoretically, yes this is possible."
Deandre Jordan
Even Deandre Jordan shoots 90% in practice.
I’m pretty sure Deandre Jordan passed his physical.
The Mavs can finally get their guy DeAndre Jordan.
Deandre Jordan made an All-NBA 1st team in 2016 :)
take Deandre Jordan please
"other good drafts include:  2012 - Draymond, Middleton, Will Barton, Crowder  2008 - DeAndre Jordan, Dragic, Pekovic, Asik  both of those had two all stars"
"“Winning is hard” isn’t an argument or something to be afraid of. It’s a reality almost all teams face that shouldn’t be ignored in decision-making. And retaining stars isn’t just hard because of that reality. It’s hard because stars have options.   KD could stay with GSW where he had won 2 rings and finals mvps or he could go to the Nets to play with his friends, Kyrie and DeAndre Jordan, the latter of whom even started initially. Kawhi could stay in Toronto and play for the team he won a ring with that was in a very good situation or he could go to LA, near home and where he seemed to get a lot of perks and say.   And if said star isn’t even making the finals, it gets way easier to find a team where the chances of winning are around the same or could be with additional moves and recruiting that will also listen to requests like slightly overpaying a friend. And if they have similar chances of winning, why not go to the team that also gives you a say?"
"Bruh, last season lebron played career low games (obviously due to injury) and career low minutes. AD played career low games (also due to injury) and career low minutes since his rookie season. They were like the 2 seed before their injuries and they still made the playoffs. You’re trying to nitpick a hypothetical to death.  Okay, maybe they aren’t the 3 or 4. Maybe they’re the 6. I was saying 3 or 4 because I’m sure they’ll want home court in the first round. But shit, they may even decide they’d rather take more time off and just barely make the playoffs and then go all out against a 1 or 2 seed in the first round, idk.   My point was that the lakers have the depth (and experience) now with rondo, Westbrook, Carmelo, Howard, gasol, ariza, and the rumors are they’ll get deandre Jordan as well, to kind of coast a bit here and there.   And the inevitable coasting will theoretically lead to a healthier and more energetic lebron and AD. Who we already know can lead a mediocre crew to a ring like 2020."
"DeAndre Jordan did get a fatty contract though, which is what this model is showing. Gobert compares well to a DeAndre Jordan that got paid, I don't think the model takes into account why he got paid."
"Q: What’s the next step for Ben Simmons?      Chris: “Shoot it. That’s it. Shoot it. Shoot it. That’s all he needs to do is shoot it, I’m telling you. I did it for 13 years in the league, man, and it didn’t steer me wrong. Shoot it. He has the playmaking ability, he is unselfish. It’s wonderful that he’s a team player. But for him to get to where he wants to go, he’s going to have to shoot the ball. I think he’s more than capable. Once he proves that he’s a threat out there, Brook Lopez and DeAndre Jordan and all those bigs, they can’t just be in the middle of the paint playing traffic cop."
He convinced people DeAndre Jordan was a DPOTY candidate before he was even a consistently plus defender.
Gasol even at this point is infinitely more valuable than Deandre Jordan.
*DeAndre Jordan
I.....dunno know how well they are modeling aging of centers if they have Rudy Gobert as the 9th most valuable player in the NBA over the next 7 yrs.   If your closest comp is DeAndre Jordan that should be sounding alarm bells for aging trajectory.
DeAndre Jordan is washed bro.  At least Gasol has an IQ and three point range
Deandre Jordan and Everyone
"I don’t have a clear answer for it, but I think there’s something in the ‘pure scorer’ discussion that’s probably worth considering.   In the same way you’d adjust TS% based on era, you could also do that for shot difficulty.   Goal is to credit points according to how much more/less efficiently the average replacement player could score them.   This would take value away from lob-catchers &amp; give value to isolation scorers. % of Field Goals Assisted on is probably the easiest proxy for this, but there’s also a ton of other stuff you could layer in. Play type, seconds left on shot clock, stage of the game, % contested, etc.   Super exaggerated example: Lou Williams 10ppg / 60%TS strictly based on end of shot clock isolation shots in the 4th quarter is bringing a lot more value to a team than Deandre Jordan catching lobs to get the same stats.   With that said, I’d imagine that it’s pretty difficult to disentangle tough shots by ‘necessity’ from a tough shot due to bad shot selection."
You can have One slightly used Deandre Jordan 🤗
DeAndre Jordan was in the ‘Scrub’ category.
"wasn't really a problem last season... injuries were. they have some good additions too, plus getting rid of deandre jordan is always a positive."
It'll be 8 when we get Deandre Jordan
Deandre Jordan would be unemployed if he wasn't KD &amp; Kyrie's friend
Ah yes the young up and coming big man DeAndre Jordan
"Is this just a case of needing any body to fill that position? Honestly just take a chance on an international player or someone from the G-League; they won't be as good as DeAndre Jordan, but either you're signing someone to play reasonable minutes in which case you're signing someone a contending team had to cut completely out of the rotation, or you're signing someone as a back-up-back-up and garbage time minutes in which case why not take a chance you get someone who could be good in the future.  I swear the Lakers are picking their C's by search engine results."
Deandre Jordan should’ve been investigated for legal manslaughter to Brandon Knight.  That dunk automatically makes him top 10.
That was born in Houston? Maybe Jimmy Butler or DeAndre Jordan.
"They made those signings, specifically Jim, because Stephen A. was ringing the alarm on ESPN every morning.   Lonzo, {Deandre Hunter}, Brandon, Julius, Zubac  Kyle, Thomas, Svi, Jordan  That's a respectable team. And aside from the bigs, there is still more room to grow from development.   The only question is whether they could of signed LeBron. Because Mitch was capable of the Anthony trade."
Probably not too 10 but Deandre Jordan has some pretty crazy dunks that would boost him up a lot
"&gt; Steph is the GOAT 3pt shooter no question  Steph is the GOAT overall shooter. He's known for his 3-point shooting, for example, but he also has the highest career FT% of all time (90.69%). He also has the 3rd highest career TS% all time (the only ones higher are obviously all big men dunkers like Deandre Jordan. He's just an amazing shooter."
Kanye’s been more washed than Deandre Jordan for like 5 years now lol
Plan A) Keep Gasol  Plan B) Gasol retires and get Boogie  Plan C) Boogie’s not available and get not DeAndre Jordan  Plan Z) Get DeAndre Jordan
Then why does deandre Jordan have the best shooting % of all time?
"Apparently Doc said that Tim's long time GF is not allowed to travel on the team plane and that annoyed him. Grant Hill confirmed this happened.  From Doc's side, he said the biggest reason they lost him wasn't the plane issue, it was that he didn't get Tim to sign to the Magic before allowing him to go back to San Antonio cos he wanted one last meeting with Pop. I think both are true and this really makes the whole DeAndre Jordan resigning to Clippers even funnier. Doc lost Tim so he knew not to make the same mistake, they literally wouldn't leave his house until he signed.  If Tim really did go to the Orlando Magic, that would have been a dynasty. Seriously, who in the East could beat them? Pistons? Nets? Sixers? They would at worse, be ECF winners multiple times. Watching them vs Lakers would have been awesome."
It is if DeAndre Jordan replaces him instead.
Can it get Paul George tho or just DeAndre Jordan and Lou Williams?
DeAndre Jordan and Rondo are younger than Melo and LeBron
"VC is probably the only guard that deserved to be in the top tier of ""hardest"" dunkers with Shaq, Dominique, DeAndre Jordan, LeBron, Shawn Kemp  There are other great dunkers but if you interpret ""hard"" as pure strength and savagery."
Blake Griffin   Shawn Kemp  Shaquille O’Neal   Deandre Jordan  LeBron James   Russell Westbrook   ————————  I have the more slimmer athletic guys in a different category: Jordan/David Thompson/Dominique/Vince Carter/ Dr.J   Westbrook is the only smaller guy in the first category
Zach Levine ??  Deandre mother fucking Jordan ??
DeAndre Jordan Mitchell Robinson Clint capela
deandre jordan (comatose form)
deandre jordan would be acting as a double agent for the nets. i love it.
I like the idea of Moses Brown evolving into 3 different pokemons  JaVale McGee (offense form)  Rudy Gobert (defense form)  DeAndre Jordan (rebound form)
"Yeah we do, he said he plans to come back to the Lakers. Shortly after there was a report that the Lakers weren’t sure if they wanted him back.   If they replace him with DeAndre Jordan that’s a significant downgrade, they already have a better version in Dwight."
&gt;Deandre Jordan is unplayable ~~in the playoffs~~.  FTFY. Terrible defense when he started. Only able to score when Harden fed him easy buckets.
"Sure cause he fell off bad, part of the reason Kenny A got fired was the dispute over Jordan and Allen. Kenny wanted Allen in the lineup but the new star players didn’t like that so he got shafted (plus he wasn’t ‘their guys’ and predated them). Nash came in and benched Jordan but by then it was clear that he was washed and Nash is Nash so there was no dispute.   It must hurt to be part of a planned trio team up that then gets a new third guy in Harden and now reporters are talking about how you are untradeable and are likely to be dumped. The new guys formed a ‘No Deandre’ club."
"Not to agree with your brothers sizzling hot takes, but in terms of playoff scoring for stars the midrange game is probably the most important. KD, Cp3, Kawhi they all make their money in the midrange.  And I too would take kobe over deandre Jordan."
"I think Deandre Jordan did, and so too did Kyrie and KD when they signed with Brooklyn, it was a condition that they also get Jordan.   Have a read: https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2019/10/29/during-2016-olympics-kyrie-irving-kevin-durant-deandre-jordan-discussed-teaming-up-in-nba/amp/"
"A lot of good starting centers are like that though, besides the top few. Capela, DeAndre Jordan on the clippers, etc. They do their work, get boards, clean the glass, and get their points that way"
OHHHH WHAT A MONSTER JAM BY DEANDRE JORDAN
"this lakers team is gonna be a trivia answer for nba team with most all stars lol  lebron, davis, westbrook, Carmelo and howard will all be Hall of famers (5), maybe rondo too (6)  Marc gasol, deandre jordan as former all stars"
DeAndre Jordan is straight up bad lol
Brook Lopez v Deandre Jordan
Deandre Jordan is unplayable in the playoffs. Surely they should be looking for pieces that can give them valuable minutes there.
"dang. i always mention him to my friends who are casual fans. i tell them the nets have kevin durant, james harden, kyrie irving, blake griffin, *and* deandre jordan. he's the cherry on top as my friends get mindf*cked"
"The Suns already signed Javale though, I don't think they need DeAndre Jordan as well."
But isn't that all LA needs?   They have Davis and Dwight already. It's not like they need a big minute earner and it's not like DeAndre Jordan was going to be that guy either.
Plus you saw Harden bitching out Jordan game after game because he was always out of position.   Once the Nets got Harden is definitely became easier to convince Durant and Kyrie that something needed to be done w/ DeAndre Jordan.
"This dude compared Johnny Manziel to DeAndre Jordan…And then LaMarcus Russell, to Jamarcus Russel. Literally the only thing similar is how close their names are together."
"KD: “I’d love to stay… just let my bud DeAndre stay, too.”  Nash: “Alright, you got a deal. Here’s the contract from the GM for you to sign.”  KD (signing): “Okay… and… done.”  Nash (on phone): “Hello, security? Please escort DeAndre Jordan from the premises, he’s no Ionger on the Nets roster.”"
Ok well that’s cap  He maybe shoots 3’s better than DeAndre Jordan
Haslem is effectively a player coach at this point. He shouldn't be compared to Deandre Jordan who should have been force retired by now.
I still remember a regular season game last season where Deandre Jordan just absolutely fucked us.
Durant isn't going to want out of playing with Harden/Kyrie because DeAndre Jordan got traded/bought out.
"I was hoping Chris Paul with sign with the nets, not for Deandre Jordan to be removed."
"Isn’t UD on a minimum though? DeAndre Jordan is getting paid like 10mil, they had minimal C depth while trying to balance KD &amp; Kyries wants/needs"
DeAndre Jordan stopped playing basketball 3 years ago and it took until now for the Nets to realize it.
"interesting facts i know:  lillard once outrebounded prime deandre jordan in a game  steve nash once fouled out in 6 minutes of playing time  zach lavine got his first 4 game winning streak with team usa since he was in ucla  prior to last season, trae young never had a 3 game winning streak at all. and he made the ecf last season"
DeAndre Jordan is a good defensive center
"He can't guard 5s like that, in rare instances and switches sure but not all game and like for example centers used to do in the earlier eras  The 5s he's played against have not been great post up players, mostly small ball players or centers like Capela, Gobert who can't do anything offensively but lobs  Look at Draymond vs good post offensive players in the playoffs:  AD averaged 32/11 in his first series against Dray, 28/11 in his second  Blake Griffin averaged 23ppg on 50% shooting, LMA averaged 23/9 on 60% TS against him, Harrell averaged 18ppg on 74% TS againts him etc    He's versatile but he was fortunate enough that his skillset was perfect for small ball, in Dray's prime 2014-2018 defensively post up centers were rare and you had DeAndre Jordan making all NBA and Drummond"
"Did you read my post? How does anyone ever get better at shooting without taking shots in game?   You can’t become a competent (not good or even great) shooter by never taking shots it’s a really low bar. It’s totally selfish. In the same exact way that shooting too much is selfish.   I think if you are going to count shot selection as the shots that someone selects to take, you should therefore be able to count the shots that someone doesn’t elect to take in the same vein.  For instance, as a Heat fan, it is pretty well known that one of the reasons we took a leap in 2020 was because of young guys like Herro and Duncan Robinson.   Duncan has stated multiple times that the reason he took that jump is how much the coaching staff beat it into his head about how selfish it was not to take his shots. If he missed, so what? They were open and he is capable.   Now Duncan is a great shooter, but how do any of us even know that? Well, he stayed on the floor by taking shots. I’m not saying Simmons would immediately become a knock down three point shooter, but he’d look like a way more intelligent and competent basketball player.   Ben Simmons isn’t so bad a shooter that he is completely incapable of shooting midrange or further. He doesn’t even create a sizable enough sample size on an annual basis for which we could honestly judge.   He just takes one three every 15 games or so. Nobody will shoot well doing that. Nobody can improve doing that.  Someone like Deandre Jordan has excellent shot selection, because he is doing what he does best completely around the rim. He is also doing exactly what the coaching staff wants though. You can’t tell me that every coaching staff Ben Simmons has ever had wouldn’t desperately want him to take more shots from range. There is a huge chasm of difference there. Nobody is dumping peak Deandre because he wouldn’t attempt more threes. You can bet your life that any Sixers fan, as they blow through the Eastern Conference, jumps out of their seat when Simmons attempts a midrange shot and then says, “you’ll get em next time bud!” He could easily take one more midrange plus shot a game and it wouldn’t effect their record almost at all.   Kobe shot .250 on game winning and tying shots in his career and many think he is one of the greatest clutch players of all time. Sometimes you just have to attempt shots and people will believe your amazing because of your BDE, your mamba mentality.   If you think Simmons has great shot selection, he has fooled you a thousand times over."
"FG% is a decent indication of how certain games went for certain players but overall it’s just not that useful at all in a broad scope. Guys like deandre Jordan and rudy gobert lead the league in the stat every year, and guys like harden look pedestrian because of FG% because of 3 point volume."
"is not broken lol   deandre jordan also has more points per shot than most stars too, is what happems when you only take open shots at the rim"
"&gt; The Bagels traded Bruce Brown, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, a 2023 1st round pick, and a 2025 1st round pick to the Cyclones for Bam Adebayo, Dewayne Dedmon, and Kyle Lowry.  Lol, thanks Brooklyn."
"they opened up a shitload of cap in 2019 and got Kyrie and KD (and deandre jordan who hitched a ride onto his talented friends). they had bird rights on Joe Harris and Brown. blake wants a free ring and signed for minimum wage. patty wants a free ring and signed for the MLE which every single team gets. they traded levert, allen, taurean prince, and 3 first rounders with 4 swaps for harden. their tax bill will be 200+ million soon but the owner can afford it"
Deandre Jordan also had an all nba before he ever made the all star game. That was an incredibly weak year for centers though.
Wow I really didn't expect to see DeAndre Jordan. He even then was mostly a lob finisher with limited offensive game
"“Harden has long brought joy to others. ‘He’s the self-proclaimed, “Purveyor of Fun,”’ says DeAndre Jordan, the Brooklyn Nets center and Harden’s designated driver. He has thrown dollars competitively since his youth. He juggles titties and plays the field. He finished high school as his class best dressed, regularly hanging with the hottest dudes. ‘He’s very talented,’ DeAndre says. ‘And whatever he gravitates towards, he’s very good at.’ Even discluding his Burning Man experience, James Harden may very well be the most interesting man in the NBA.”"
You’re saying Deandre Jordan posts up? You ever seen him play?
Deandre Jordan is debuffed Dwight Howard with worse game sense
DeAndre Jordan lmfao
the inclusion of the Deandre Jordan dunk is so perfectly timed wow
"- Posterized by DeAndre Jordan  - Crossed over and falls flat on his face vs Kyrie  - This  Yeah, definitely up there"
“The lob… the jam! Oh what a monster jam from Deandre Jordan!”
"&gt;Not necessarily the only thing important. Yes, KAT is quite possibly the best shooting big man of all time. But there is more to scoring than shooting percentages. By that logic, Kobe was not one of the best scorers in league history and DeAndre Jordan is the best scorer in league history.  Because you are being dumb and comparing a rim running C to a jump shooting SG.  AD and KAT are 2 players of similar age,position and playstyle that you can very well compare them and easily see who is the more gifted scorer."
"Not necessarily the only thing important. Yes, KAT is quite possibly the best shooting big man of all time. But there is more to scoring than shooting percentages. By that logic, Kobe was not one of the best scorers in league history and DeAndre Jordan is the best scorer in league history."
"In the early to mid 2010s alot of BR’s rankings were put together based HEAVILY on hype/speculation. To this day I’ll never understand why Wiggins had so much hype, it’s one thing if people were saying he was gonna be a definite all star but Wiggins was being declared the best prospect since Lebron. Okafor could’ve been(and still has enough potential) to be a top big man, idk why he’s being treated as an end of the bench player. Cousins would def be a top 5 player in the league right now if he didn’t get injured. Idk why they got Deandre Jordan on here…even at his peak he wasn’t a top 20 player so why would he be one in his 30’s? And Dragan Bender is an even bigger wtf here. I could understand them putting Porzingis in that spot but people were only high on Bender in the first place because they though he’d be another Porzingis."
"I could say the same for you. You actually just revolve around TS because that’s the only thing going for KAT and it favors your argument.  You couldn’t even provide other evidence. Like, you can’t justify the PER, you couldn’t justify skill set, or any other aspects of their game. You spew TS% like it’s the end all be all. If TS% was the sole indicator, DeAndre Jordan is the best scorer of all time lmao. Shows what you know if you rely solely on one advanced metric."
murdered by deandre jordan too this mans highlights are his lowlights
"Deandre Jordan was pretty damn solid during the Lob City era  Of course seeing his name in the top 20 would be laughable nowadays, but 5 years ago it was pretty understandable"
"Yeah this wasn't even hard do one like ""Player A is Kareen Abdul Jabbar player B is DeAndre Jordan"" and everyone chooses B to surprise us"
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
The real question is who thought DeAndre Jordan would rank above Lebron at any point in his career?
It’s not about that. It’s about thinking Deandre freaking Jordan would be better than him.
Having Deandre Jordan without LeBron is enough is make it absurd.
Why Deandre Jordan tho?
DeAndre Jordan? What?
why did they think Deandre Jordan would age gracefully. The other ones made even a small amount of sense but DJ does not.
it depends on the context  2021 randle + 2016 drummond + 2016 deandre jordan is not no superteam
"The best big man Giannis had to play past was Bam, who played the worst he's ever played. Then he had to go against DeAndre Jordan, who all Nets fans unanimously agree is a net negative. In the ECF, he had to face John Collins and past his prime Capela. Giannis played remarkable, he played like a finals MVP, but it's a neanderthal take to just say that Harden hasn't ever played better than Giannis' averages without contextualizing any of it."
"Yeah he looked washed in the 2011 playoffs. Crazy to watch him then playing against Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol, and then to watch him in 2015 against DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. Despite being 4 years older he was much more effective and was his team's #1 offensive weapon for half of that series plus sealed one of the wins by stuffing a Griffin dunk attempt and then stripping him of the ball."
"It's the same reason why DeAndre Jordan lead the league in FG% for a few years (at least, I recall him doing this, I could be wrong, he was at the very least top 3 for a few years).   It's more about the types of shots he is taking than it is about him having better ""finishing ability"" than other players.   No one in their right mind would say that Williams is a better finisher than LeBron, for example.   Williams takes lots of *easy* shots. Relatively undefended, and right at the rim. That's why.   But he's making the most of his opportunities, that's for sure.   I mean, think about it. If Williams was able to score at this efficiency at a higher volume and with more difficult shots, he'd be scoring 40 points a game because you'd just feed him the ball all game.  Edit: that's not to say that Williams isn't a capable inside scorer, because he obviously is, it's just that the numbers seem gaudy because of the high percentage of shot attempts that are very high percentage for any player.   Williams also has to put himself in the right spots to make these plays happen, so that's another thing he's really good at."
"You'd be surprised - I ended up following the team (and becoming interested in basketball in general) during the middle of that time, the '15-'16 year! When we got screwed by Deandre Jordan, I really enjoyed rooting for our underdog team (few people thought we'd get top 8 in the west) and our journey through the season despite how things went in the playoffs.   You're right about the state of the subreddit, though. It blew up exponentially after Luka's draft and it's been difficult to post rational takes and without getting unreasonable responses back."
"Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Marc Gasol, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan and LaMarcus Aldridge (maybe) will be split among 2 teams."
"Eh, we don’t know that for sure. If Wiseman is going to be playing a true “Deandre Jordan” type of role, he would be the ideal starter."
"Cp3 needs to Deandre Jordan, Deandre Ayton. Still think Paul’s greatest accomplishment was getting DJ on the All-NBA First team."
"Neither could DeAndre Jordan, for any other team."
DeAndre Jordan of course.
"Available right now, who could put in minutes at C more usefully than the husk of DeAndre Jordan?  Tacko Fall, Isaiah Hartenstein, Thon Maker - but wait, they're young and have potential to get better, rather than being old and declining, the Lakers don't do that now."
"DeAndre Jordan Mavs, Morris to the Spurs so they cut Bertans"
"It depends on the team. The Lakers could probably get someone more useful from the buyout market than DeAndre Jordan. But even if they didn't get someone that particularly useful, as a Laker fan I'd have rather they used that roster spot on someone who might potentially have some upside that they can develop. Simply looking at the 14th and 15th spots on your roster as pointless, for guys who will never play is wasteful."
"I believe he is talking about DeAndre Jordan, not LMA."
Why are we making such a fuss about DeAndre Jordan?
"Yeeeeah, somehow I don't think the Clippers are losing sleep about not having a 73 year old Deandre Jordan over Zubac"
&gt;DeAndre Jordan admits he always wanted to play with... Dwight Howard.
"Deandre Jordan is a big versatile defensive minded big, can guard 1-5, can handle the rock, find open teammates, good in the post, stout rim protector, and I also heard he’s working on his three point shot👀 Lakers got a steal"
it's either gonna be Blake Griffin after he signed with the Nets or he's gonna be DeAndre Jordan with the Nets. No in between.
"Idk Drummond was pretty bad, and the Lakers basically have Drummond in DeAndre Jordan"
Yea that’s what they did with DeAndre Jordan. The rest were players they signed or players they traded for in order to dump players they signed
&gt;. He'd have been a significant upgrade on Biz  i get that Biz is bad but DeAndre Jordan is not a significant upgrade over anyone
"Vince made less all nba teams in his career than Gilbert Arenas, Jermaine O'Neal,  DeAndre Jordan, and Amare Stoudemire.  And when you take away his 8 seasons averaging &lt;10ppg he is not even a top 30 scorer. Which is really the only thing he was elite at for a short period of time.  Never sniffed an MVP (unlike Blake who finished 3rd), never made the finals, missed the playoffs for the majority of his prime.  Vince was basically a more popular Zach Lavine. If Lavine plays for 22 years as a bench player would he be a hall of famer to you as well?"
He would be a stronger DeAndre Jordan today.
"Eh the argument is still inflating relevance with accolades. The reality - dude was a freak athlete who could block in a time when big men in the East didn’t need to shoot the 3 and had to outrebound Ilgauskaus to make the finals. For all the 2000s dominance, he was a role player without any offensive game at a time when Shaq was on the decline, Yao was perennially hurt, and Bynum was a knucklehead. Dwight was de facto best big men simply by his freakish athleticism. Playing with the Lakers exposed that the dude literally had nothing in the post, a la DeAndre Jordan or Amare Stoudemire. Once the NBA changed and big men had to actually be able to shoot, he couldn’t and his decline in athleticism lead to irrelevance for a decade until he finally swallowed his pride and adjusted his game.  I think he’s still a HOF cuz the HOF rewards big men for just being big. But the difference between him vs the likes of Giannis, who adapted his offensive game this year and stopped trying to force being the primary option, makes Howard a second ticket ballot."
No Lakers fan believes Deandre Jordan is better than Gasol
"To be fair. I think he a better baller than his brother or deandre Jordan at this point, and both got a spot in the league"
"Remember when CP3, Blake and Doc locked Deandre Jordan in his house and bullied him into re-signing with the Clippers?   Pepperidge Farm remembers"
"Remember when CP3, Blake and Doc locked Deandre Jordan in his house and bullied him into re-signing with the Clippers?   Pepperidge Farm remembers"

"I actually remember their coverage on that, props for bringing that up lmao.  IMO it was their 2nd funniest bit though... their funniest had to be the DeAndre Jordan reneg situation. Timing-wise it all coincided with Ballmer switching to the newer, uglier Clippers logo so Max had a theory that DeAndre was trying to scare the Clips into signing somewhere else unless the Clips revert back to their original logo and jerseys, making DJ a martyr in the process.  Fuck I haven't listened to the radio in ages but I miss that show."
"They almost had Deandre Jordan, until the Clippers did everything possible to successfully ruin that"
DeAndre Jordan (thru texts)
You mean Pistons legend DeAndre Jordan?
"Rose will not make it, barring some late-career renaissance.  Apart from the MVP award he's in the Gilbert Arenas, Brandon Roy, DeAndre Jordan, Mark Price, Latrell Sprewell, and Glen Rice zone accolades-wise."
Is it though? I remember Deandre Jordan got 1st team lol
"Passing: Jason Williams, Jason Kidd, Nash  Dunks: Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Shawn Kemp  Finishing: MJ, Kyrie  Shooting: Curry, Dame  Defense: Kawhi"
He made DeAndre Jordan look serviceable lmao him and AD would break the league
"My point is a lot of people who never saw prime shaq look at him the way they do Prime Deandre Jordan. No, you can't just hack Shaq and make him unplayable/give your team an advantage. Shaq was either going to score or draw a foul. Neither were good options for a defense. Hack a Shaq was more successful late in his career when he couldn't punish you for it 40 minutes a game.   &amp;#x200B;  Giannis had a great series, but he played against a team with 1 center on it. In contrast NBA contenders had roster spots just to eat up fouls for shaq and bang with him downlow. Shaq having a lower TS% is a reflection of that, not a reflection of being less dominant. To put it into perspective, every contender in the early 2000s thought about Shaq when constructing their team. How many western conference teams were thinking about Giannis last year? Certainly not the Suns. This difference shows a difference in dominance levels."
"LOL Perkins is right for a change. Also Deandre Jordan, who I never thought was as good as people made him out to be is beyond washed."
such a classic call too.   here comes chris paul. ^THE ^LOB. ^^THE ^^JAM! Oh what a monster jam by DeAndre Jordan!
"Agree 100% It looked cool, and the Clippers announcers + crowd sell it even better than the dunk itself. Not to take away from Jordan, he had his knees bent, ball cocked back midair it was nasty as fuck.  When i think of posters i think of Jordan on Ewing, Kobe on Dwight (and riding him like a horse) , Bron on Jason Terry.   Why Bron on Jason Terry? Yes it is a case of a bigger man dunking on a smaller man, but Jason Terry had been talking wild smack talk to Lebron that whole season and from the Dallas days too. he had it coming. Deandre Jordan basically just committed straight up murder on an innocent bystander."
Show the play where Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan win a ring
"I know that’s his last name but can we not EVER and I mean ever call deandre Jordan, Jordan again."
Crazy we signed DeAndre Jordan over Cousins.  Something must happens behind the scenes because every team he ends up on doesn't bring him back.  Pelicans/Lakers/Rockets/Clippers all let him walk.
Why haven’t nba teams tried to bring sanders back? He can’t be that old. Gotta be better than deandre Jordan.
Deandre Jordan lol
"I mean, the stats you pointed out basically have Duncan and Garnett even.   If your main argument is that KG contributed to his team defense more than I think you’re underselling Tim’s defense. KG and Duncan were definitely on par there. Reducing Tim’s defense to just rim protection is pretty unfair. Timmy did a lot more on D than someone like Deandre Jordan.   If you want to compare their peaks at some point it just comes down to preference. On both offense and defense, Tim was more dominant in the post, but KG was more versatile. On offense, Tim had a more aggressive scoring mentality, whereas KG was a bit passive and looked to set up his teammates more."
Deandre Jordan
"Old heads, and/or retired players , don’t see age like everyone else does. A little bit of denial.  There’s also an unwritten code of reverence. So to their mind,  Rondo, Deandre Jordan, ariza, etc can be just as valuable as as they were in…2010."
Deandre jordan rebounder and thts about it
Yeah and DeAndre Jordan was the most efficient scorer of all time lol. Like not being able to shoot doesn't mean ur efficient.
"As a Lakers fan, I’m not happy about the signing. But I would normally say ‘well LeBron knows what he’s doing.’ And then I remember them singing Drummond and for sure LeBron had to be keen on that in order to happen. And now Westbrook…I think LeBron has a certain strategy in mind but it’s risky. I would have just tried to find 3 and D guys, and athletic players.   There’s a reason Danny Green, Caruso, Avery Bradley, Dwight, worked in 2020.  This year we have instead Ariza, Ellington, Monk, Nunn, and now 2021’s Drummond - DeAndre Jordan."
There's a clear reason.    DeAndre Jordan is mad that Jokic is more skilled than him.
"You went 73-9 and then signed the 2nd best player in the league. Lakers got washed Deandre Jordan, Ariza, rondo etc. your comment is a joke."
"Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, and Deandre Jordan in 2012 is nutty. Gasol and Jordan are DPOY players, and Howard is on a decline from 3 straight DPOY."
So does Deandre Jordan play for the Lakers or Pistons what's going on.
"If the starters are prime LeBron - young Westbrook - prime Melo - prime Marc Gasol - prime Dwight Howard (BPA line-up), that would still leave a bench of prime Rondo - prime Ellington - prime Ariza - rookie AD - young DeAndre Jordan. Very solid bench.  Throw in some minutes for a rookie Bazemore and make sure 12-year-old THT, 14-year-old Malik Monk don't touch the court, and maybe even 17-year-old Kendrick Nunn."
"Lebron, Carmelo, Westbrook, Rondo, Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, Trevor Ariza, DeAndre Jordan, Wayne Ellington. That's a very deep playoff team and it's not losing to anyone. Miles better than that Heat team."
DeAndre Jordan is washed and can no longer dunk. Rondo looks like a turtle and has nothing left in the tank.
Do Deandre Jordan and Rajon Rondo!
"Yeah, the Masai belief is because his hit/miss ratio is so good, there's not much regret.  The Caboclo thing I get, though I did want Capela as it seemed clear from his tape he could be a rim running/rim protector that was popular at the time (ala Tyson Chandler/DeAndre Jordan).  I remember we were in talks to acquire Memphis' pick so I thought we would get him with one of the two."
Deandre Jordan
"He is the sixth winningest coach in NBA history, saying DeAndre Jordan has a better legacy is idiotic."
I'm beginning to greatly dislike these loser veterans who are so obviously hangers on for a ring. It's pathetic and more ridiculous than ever. Not that DeAndre Jordan is any good but still. All the vets are signing with the same 2 teams.
Players with a greater legacy than George Karl on the ~~2012-13~~ 2021-22 Lakers:  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Carmelo Anthony  Dwight Howard  Rajon Rondo  Marc Gasol  DeAndre Jordan
"This whole Deandre Jordan situation is confusing the hell out of me.  I can't tell if the Pistons made out like bandits or got screwed, lol."
"Veteran Deandre Jordan off bench of course, Drummond would kill any momentum of ""winning"""
whats even the point of DeAndre Jordan off the bench?
There have been a grand total of zero days where DeAndre Jordan was the best center in the league
"Take notes Ben Simmons, Deandre Jordan is a prime example of what happens when you don’t change your game and your athleticism leaves you"
"Nah I disagree, this year is a developmental season, and as a talent-deprived team we really shouldn’t be letting young talent just walk. This could bite us in the ass badly in the future.   There were also [reports ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10011585-nets-trade-rumors-deandre-jordan-1st-round-draft-pick-being-offered-in-talks) that Brooklyn was offering a first to dump DJ"
"We bought out Blake because any money we can save from his contract helps us sign new players and gather more capital.  We would've literally had to fork over capital to a team to trade him.  We traded Sekou, Jahlil, and took on DeAndre for picks and picked up cash.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but that cash should be able to be used as a trade piece.  We bought out Deandre Jordan because any money we can save from his contract helps us sign new players and gather more capital.  We would've literally had to fork over capital to a team to trade him.  Simple moves for a rebuilding team.  Take contracts for capital.  Troy Weaver is a great GM, not a pawn for the Nets"
DeAndre Jordan has literally nothing to offer at this point. He was a net negative when on the floor for the Nets. And that was on a team that needed a big like him !
Pistons Legend DeAndre Jordan?
Deandre Jordan. Probably the worst player to ever get 1st team all Nba (I think he was 1st team)
DeAndre Jordan is so fucking washed tho like who cares?
"You're dreaming if you think getting washed DeAndre Jordan, Rondo, and Howard is anything close to signing prime fuckin KD to a 73-9 win team lmao."
"Dude, it’s fucking DeAndre Jordan. Not making the lakers that much worse"
I'm assuming this is just theorising and not actually sourced from Lakers people. That said if it is they pulled the ultimate bait and switch by floating all the AD at the 5 stuff only to turn it into DeAndre Jordan is your starting C.
"""Yall only won cuz DeAndre Jordan was injured"""
Chris Paul’s crowning achievement is getting Deandre Jordan a first team all-nba selection
George Hill will be serviceable than most of who they have signed. DeAndre Jordan did not see the court in the playoffs and lots of these guys won't in a tough series
Would love that to happen. DeAndre Jordan is washed but this thing is really getting annoying
"Teams are allowed 15 players and with Gasol, Rondo and DeAndre Jordan the Lakers now have 14. Two way contracts are separate."
Then we got to even darker days where Deandre Jordan was the unanimous best center in the league
Four second round picks and DeAndre Jordan? That doesn't seem that low to me
"Dude, DeAndre Jordan sucks now. Real bad. Why would you ever want to waste a roster spot on a guy you’re never going to play, who can’t help you in any way? “Veteran leadership”? Cause we all know how much vets love riding the bench and losing every night. I’m sure he would’ve been a super positive influence there."
"In what world does that mean TS% is worthless? Deandre Jordan has a higher career field goal % than lebron or Jordan, that doesn’t make deandre better. It also doesn’t mean field goal % is a worthless stat either."
"But he does on the Lakers. It's like you haven't been watching the games that are definitely happening in which DeAndre Jordan, Laker, is running the floor like a gazelle, you CASUAL"
I never thought I’d see Deandre Jordan in a Lakers jersey  I’d hope he never joined the Lakers
Just saying that he's much more likely to have a positive impact than DeAndre Jordan or melo
Is okafor better than deandre jordan?
"Dwight was seen as a team cancer and was out of the league if we didn't pick him up. Deandre Jordan is no where near good, lol. You're overhyping a player that everyone thinks is trash"
"Bruh, obviously it's not because of DeAndre Jordan. Maybe this entire offseason? Lol"
Really? Over washed DeAndre Jordan? Lol
"No the Pistons could not use DeAndre Jordan, have you watched him recently? I don’t see a single way the Pistons could possibly benefit from keeping Jordan. Not every old vet who isn’t good anymore automatically provides veteran leadership, some of them are just useless."
DeAndre Jordan doesn’t move the needle from bad to meh  It’s still better business to use him as a backup center for 2 season providing veteran leadership instead of paying him 8M to play for the lakers
"We’re talking about deandre Jordan, not fucking igoudala"
I’d rather have Bynum than Deandre Jordan tbh
DeAndre Jordan is bad though?  Typically young/rebuilding teams would rather take fliers on prospects than just slot in veterans since there is a higher upside. Once the team is ready to compete you can round it out with veterans.
Stewart hasn’t even proven to be an adequate starter and Olynyk isn’t a true center   The Pistons could use DeAndre Jordan
Double agent Deandre Jordan
"Imagine Drummond with slightly higher basketball IQ, much worse defense, and a better resume   That’s DeAndre Jordan in 2021"
DeAndre “I Don’t Need An Agent I’ll Do This Shit Myself” Jordan
"LA, I'M COMING.  ~ DeAndre Jordan"
"DeAndre Jordan got on the phone with the Pistons and Weaver said “alright, let’s work on the buyout quickly, so how much you’ll give back?”"
"They have the same core: lebron and AD. And that may be enough.  But everyone else is a questionable fit at best. Ariza, Melo and Ellington haven’t been useful in years. Westbrook is liable to lose close playoff games by himself. The nets literally discarded Deandre Jordan because they didn’t think he was good enough."
"He pulled a KAT for 2016 Wolves KG but then some.  That level of reaction is something you would see only in a Lebron, Richard Jefferson, Deandre Jordan dunk compilation or something."

DeAndre Jordan is a traffic cone
"On off splits are a pretty bad way of evaluating two players against each other. Says way more about the lineups that they are played in than how good they are as players. For example Harden played a ton more minutes with DeAndre Jordan, who is just downright terrible"
"Harden’s on/off is screwed up by playing a lot of minutes with DeAndre Jordan while KD was out. I can’t find the website, but it showed Harden’s net rating somewhere around +8-10 without DeAndre Jordan on the court."
He will lose his leverage once Harden sign his extension. Case in point: Deandre Jordan
"Another disclaimer, Deandre Jordan brought down the defensive rating a lot. The sample size is small, but any combination of the Big 3 with Deandre Jordan off the court did much better"
"Ayton tried the face up game when he first got into the league.  It wasn't that great because it just turned into turnaround 2s without drawing fouls.  What he did in HS like 4 years ago is pretty irrelevant.  Ayton broke out last year (and by break out, I mean became a meaningful contributor on a playoff team, not superstar) by embracing the DeAndre Jordan type of roll.  He's terrific in that role, but that role is inherently limited (although against a team like last year's Clippers it was invaluable; Ayton could punish small lineups on offense, unlike Gobert)."
deandre jordan is smiling rn
"That is 2016 all-NBA first team Deandre Jordan, 2time third team, 2time all defensive, one time All-star Deandre Jordan"
"The Nets don’t have bad defense though even right now, after removing DeAndre Jordan from the rotation their defense improved a ton, in the playoffs they were playing amazing defense, possibly the best defense any team played on Giannis."
"Its between them and the Lakers. The Lakers have Westbrook, AD, LeBron, Monk, Dwight, and Horton-Tucker. And they have DeAndre Jordan for emotional support who's only being named since he participated in the dunk contest once"
"I can't. I seriously can't.  I never liked him, even when he was still on the Cavs.  Never considered him a superstar.  Never understood how so many people became his fans.  Called out the trade would flop for the Celtics, when they got him.  Called it the Nets won't win shit with him and KD. Of course, bringing Harden aboard could have changed all that, but now Kyrie is acting up again, and I am sure that this will slowly be grinding KD's nerves. KD is obsessed with basketball, and I am sure he wants to win to show he can win without the Warriors, and if Kyrie is ruining that for him, at some point he'll turn on Kyrie and have the Nets trade his stupid flat-earher ass for someone who can help win games.  Sure, Kyrie is KD's friend, but apparently so was DeAndre Jordan, but they eventually got rid of DAJ, who was pretty useless."
Need Deandre Jordan for this moment. Nets fucked
Both teams have so many good dunkers what the fuck. I could even include DeAndre Jordan
I agree it’s weird that people forget Deandre Jordan was a bucket
"&gt;That’s like saying that DeAndre Jordan back in the Lob City days could’ve dropped 25 a game  HOLY SHIT!!!  You are comparing Wilt Chamberlain to DeAndre Jordan.   If you HONESLTY don't think that Wilt could have dropped 25 a game at 36 had he wanted to or was called upon to, then I have ZERO respect for your opinion on basketball.   And if you are going to compare Wilt dropping 13 a game on 70+% shooting to DeAndre Jordan, it just demonstrates how utterly unaware you are of Wilt's ability.   Check out these highlights from his [final game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197305100LAL.html). A do-or-die game that the Lakers lost, Wilt played all 48 minutes, put on a defensive clinic (see him cut off the lanes to guys coming in, forcing up bad shots, providing help defense, and shutting down the paint), and dropped 23 and 21 on the biggest stage in a do-or-die game.   If you think DeAndre could do that just because he had a .700 FG%, then you need to watch some more basketball.   Or if you think me saying that Wilt could is like saying DeAndre could... well, that is just some ignorant, bad faith horse shit.   You can see in the first half, when they rely mostly on man-to-man defense, he flips around and draws foul after foul flicking up his famous finger role. And in the second half, the Knicks had to send over help defense, so Wilt ends up with 2 or three guys around him and is still getting shots off and dunking through them.  So yeah.. if he were on a team that needed 25 or 30 a game from him at 36, I've no doubt that he could have done that at that age.   And he was efficient because he was a killer, NOT because people weren't guarding him and leaving him to help out with Blake and he had Chris Paul setting up easy lobs for him.   Wilt's .727 and DAJ's .717 were achieved in WILDLY different ways for WILDLY different reasons.   And Wilt's per game average is not demonstrative of his 'failing ability' or 'slowing down': It was demonstrative of his shift to a team-first approach to the game where he took on the role of defender and rebounder and let other guys focus on offense, which he facilitated by drawing defender (which DAJ didn't do) and passing out of the post when double teamed to the tune of 4+ assists per game (which DAJ never did).   Man... get your head out of your ass with this bad faith shit. You think you are talking to a 4th grader here? I've been watching basketball for 30+ years, and when I was a kid I poured through more books on the Russell-Wilt era than I could hope to count."
"DeAndrew Jordan has a 67.4 FG% for his CAREER. He got over 70% multiple times and averaged like 12-13 ppg doing so.   Ayton got 14.4 ppg on 62.6 FG% this year - though he did get 18.2 and 16.3 ppg in the last 2 years, though on a much worse efficiency.   Both players had hyper insane efficiency due to being spoon-fed lobs and dunks. There was a time where DeAndre Jordan was considered a good center, similar to Ayton today, then well... the rest of his career happened. I'm not saying that Ayton is DeAndre Jordan. Maybe he'll become a top 5 center similar to Embiid, but he gotta show more than he did this past season."
"Same thing with Lebron at the 4.   Looking forward to watching Deandre Jordan start for the Lakers this year, lol."
"Did you ever stop and think about why he became such an efficient scorer when he was older? It’s because he was taking less shots. That’s like saying that DeAndre Jordan back in the Lob City days could’ve dropped 25 a game easily if he wasn’t playing with guys like CP3, Blake, JJ, and Jamal Crawford, since he was shooting like 70% back then. That’s just not how efficiency works.   Wilt hadn’t scored 30+ a game in a season since 1965-66, back when he was still 29. He couldn’t have scored 30 a game over a full season when he was 36, I’m sorry to break it to you. He was an athletic freak, but he wasn’t fucking Hercules or Superman.   And I wasn’t talking about him playing until 40 and still being a great player, there’s zero doubt in my mind that he could’ve done that if he wanted to. I’m talking about him coming out of retirement after 13 years at the age of 50. He wouldn’t have been a good player anymore if he chose to come back. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just how it is."
"And neither of those players were sure fire max extensions, either.  Keeping Ayton, a traditional center, around for his first 7 years with a risk of him leaving versus his first 9 years (but for a lot of extra money) is a risk I'd be willing to take.  If he were in the superstar stratosphere (or even if he had the potential be be one), maybe it's a larger concern?  I think Ayton tops out as, what, 3rd team All NBA?  If he hits a 2nd or 1st team (due to injuries), I think he's closer to DeAndre Jordan than, say, Embiid or Jokic last year."
"Our offense literally turned him into a glorified deandre Jordan. We cut out his post ups and made him stop shooting midrangers(which where his go to shot.), and made him set screens and just rim run. This is why dude came in this year and said he is done sacrificing."
You don’t want to max a guy who is just another Deandre Jordan  His offensive game is so limited it is unacceptable for a max player
"Lol its the Chris Paul effect. Deandre Jordan, Tyson Chandler and David West all got huge contracts after playing with him only to never live up to their ""potential"" its way too easy to get buckets as a big man next to CP3."
All these Suns fans angry about this are going to conveniently forget this when they realize how limited Ayton is post-CP3.  Ayton is Deandre Jordan Plus.
"He caught the ball and layed it up 8 times a game. He has no shot creating ability what so ever. If the suns max deandre Jordan with perimeter defense, that’s a bad contract."
"You know who has the highest true shooting of all time? DeAndre Jordan. MPJ's volume and efficiency coming from all levels is just far more impressive and far more valuable than what Ayton is doing despite similar numbers. Ayton had a good playoff run (apart from the finals where he was very very bad), but looking at the current NBA and looking at both their career trajectories there's absolutely no way I'm taking a jack of all trades center over an athletic super efficient 3 level scorer"
"When you only do lobs and bunnies, youll be efficient like deandre jordan"
"if DeAndre Jordan is actually playing for the Lakers, they aren't contenders"
&gt;Detroit Pistons: Traded for DeAndre Jordan and bought him out so he could go to the Lakers  Yeah not like they got the #1 overall pick in the draft or anything
"Not at all. That's why you saw Heat fans last season ranting and raving about Trevor Ariza being a ""great shooter"" because he was shooting 37% from 3.   They can't extrapolate that 37% on 3 attempts is 1 on average per game.   The problem people don't understand with basketball maths is that it is EXTREMELY contextual and why people like Deandre Jordan are shit players despite having good stats."
Exact reaction I had lol. Forgot he was part of the Deandre Jordan trade and then the Pistons immediately bought out Jordan so he could go to the Lakers. Jahlil Okafor was part of it too tho I think he was bought as well.
"I agree with Capela but he didn't really make the others look 10 million great. He is probably one of the top PnR  passers (not sure where) but I don't think he really did much to the rep of Kenneth Faried, Isiah Hartenstein, and DeAndre Jordan"
"Argument for Harden is that he made Capela who he is now, and made Kenneth Faried, Isiah Hartenstein, and DeAndre Jordan look worth $10 million contracts. Even Claxton looks so lost on offense without Harden. All these guys you mentioned have played with all star bigs, some of them were all time greats. One time Harden played with above average center was Dwight, and then Dwight idk why but he just refused to play pick and roll."
"That's one of the most notorious defender the game has ever seen, Reggie ""DeAndre Jordan"" Jackson."
I'm just glad I'm not seeing Deandre Jordan quotes every night anymore
"The Deandre Jordan version where he got locked up in his house by Klay, Steph, Draymond and Steve Kerr"
No! Deandre Jordan
"Pistons tacked him on in the Deandre Jordan trade, absolutely confounding decision. I realize that Weaver didn’t draft him so it’s a new regime and whatever, but still."
"Seriously, it doesn't show anything at all here, and on top of that the OP lied about what happened. Dwight fouled out and he posts a clip of nothing but dead ball time with players on the bench and Dwight giving DeAndre Jordan a hug and he labeled it as Dwight being ejected. The mods should remove this post."
Deandre jordan dunked a ball! Lob city bros!
I think that's DeAndre Jordan
i wonder if he got forced the same way DeAndre Jordan was trapped during FA XD
&gt;!DeAndre Jordan wouldn't get past the first game!&lt;
"Easiest would be: Rim Running Center/Pure Scoring Wing. Examples of this are DeAndre Jordan in his prime, Andrew Wiggins. You basically have one job and other players can set it up for you.   Hardest would be point forward or all-around guard.   Examples of this are Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Scottie Pippen, James Harden.   You kinda have to be good-elite on multiple facets to be considered as effective."
Rajon Rondo/Mac McClung/Wes Matthews/Trevor Ariza/DeAndre Jordan  That’s the Lakers garbage time lineup in this years game 6 finals clinching win.
At least a nonshooter like deandre Jordan can still dunk it.
Embiid and DeAndre Jordan will be interesting next season
"Man, it’s so great the center position has returned to a point where we can have these discussions. There were years when Deandre Jordan and Tyson Chandler were the best bigs in the game and it would be a guard driven league for years to come. Basketball, like everything is cyclical. It’s like that period in the NFL when there were no great bell cow RBs and people just assumed there never would be again. Then you get LeVeon, Elliott and a slough of other dudes.   Personally, the center position is my favorite and Joker is my favorite player for really redefining the position. He’s doing things that have not really ever been done at the position. He can pass and handle, while being a huge brute that can play with his back to the basket. It is impossible to double team Joker. The Suns were able to guard him very capably with basically just Ayton and that really slowed down the Nuggets who depend on getting great looks off Jokic’s superior passing.  Meanwhile, Embiid is a marvel. The fact he continues to improve while collecting injuries like baseball cards is nuts and probably unsustainable. That said, when he is healthy, I don’t think there is a more unstoppable low post force. As a Heat fan, I can say we really struggle with Embiid, but honestly with Ben present, there are ways to defend the Sixers that wouldn’t exist if you had a more traditional point. He’s just so big and powerful and he can defend his position and the paint at an elite level. He’s just a monster and he can still stretch the floor to keep people honest.   I’m going to say Joker just because I love his game so much. He, like the best point guards and distributors, makes everyone around him a better basketball player. You just have to be able to play off-ball with Joker because he is such an amazing passer. I can’t wait to see Embiid with a traditional point guard, because I don’t think he will be able to be hammered so hard in the paint. There could potentially be someone at the top of the key willing to stretch the floor and punish teams for sinking down on him. That is something he has never really had unless Ben is off the court and it will be fun to watch.   That said, I would say Embiid is a more physically imposing player and a highly skilled big, but I think Joker does more in terms of contributing to the wins his team accumulates. It’s close in that regard, but they are also really different players completely. I would say, that the only player that is maybe a better offensive player in the entire league is Harden or Durant, but Harden can’t post all five guys on the court up effectively and Durant can’t pass as well as Joker. Also, neither of those two guys are 7-feet tall and 300ish pounds. Joker is as effective getting offensive rebounds down low as he is leading a fast break. He’s absolutely nuts and just a different kind of dude.   The Denver Nuggets offense reminds me of a solar system where Jokic is the Sun and everyone just runs around him coming off screens and all sorts of things and the Sun is just shooting it’s light rays to the depths of the solar system, finding anything that can be touched by its rays. It’s a weird metaphor I guess, but it’s why I love watching him. He’s like 300-pound Steve Nash."
"If it's Steph curry talk about how his ""gravity"" lets other players get open looks.   Yell ""moving screen"" every jazz pick and roll  Mention that luka doncic has elite deceleration whenever he has the ball  Talk about how sick Rudy Gay, Derrick Rose, DeAndre Jordan used to be  Reminisce about Greg Oden. He would've been bill Russell come again.   Say the officiating is ruining the game.   If randle or siakam drive to the rim, be ready with a beyblade comment Incase they make a spin move.  Go nuts when Caruso does anything  I have passed on all knowledge I have young nephew, it is up to you to carry the flame"
Deandre Jordan
&gt;Zero chance you've ever checked Kobe's FG%.  Damn DeAndre Jordan the goat??
Chris Paul has had the worst teammates up until the end of his career with Houston and Phoenix. Still puzzles me have anyone even then thought DeAndre Jordan was going to be a championship piece. On top of Blake and Jordan goofy attitudes on and off the court. Would of loved to see Chris Paul with a Harden or Gasol brother in his prime.
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"DeAndre Jordan survived the modern nba, Ben Wallace would be fine."
"That’s a good point to this, if they had gone the Butler route instead, they could have signed a standard type center like DeAndre Jordan or something for exception level money.  OKC was looking to give away Adams during that stretch of time."
"Rondo is a fringe rotational player now. The only reason he’s in the league is cause of his high IQ. He’s not a scoring threat, his shooting has improved but he’s still super inconsistent and low volume so he doesn’t space the floor, at this point he’s a defensive liability. All he does is pass. Like Elfrid payton with worse defence.  THT can occasionally take guys off the dribble and play some decent defence. Nothing more. Lakers fans just hype him up cause he’s their only young player. He’s not good.   Bazemore is probably the worst defender in the league that qualifies for the “3 and D” label and he’s not some knockdown shooter. He was a low end rotation guy for a team that already had poor depth last year in GS.  Deandre Jordan couldn’t get minutes on a team starved at the C position. He’s completely washed. And ask any Philly fan and they’ll tell you the same thing about Dwight. He’s lost a lot of his mobility which means rather than the defender he was in LAL where he’d step up on pick and rolls and be a constant menace, he always plays in the drop coverage where he gets abused"
" PLAYER | CAP FIGURE  ---|---|---- Blake Griffin | $29,764,126| DeAndre Jordan | $7,875,533 |  Dewayne Dedmon |$2,866,667|  Cory Joseph | $2,400,000 |  Deividas Sirvydis |$1,517,981 |  Zhaire Smith| $1,068,200 |"
"According to bballrefrence their dead money is at $44.4M. Is there someone missing?   Blake Griffin - $29,784,216  DeAndre Jordan - $7,875,533  Dewayne Dedmon - $2,866,667  Cory Joseph - $2,400,000 (from his prior contract)   Deividas Sirvydis - $1,517,981  This totals $44,424,397 in dead money for Detroit, which is higher than the Thunders payroll as of right now. As OKC guarantees contracts, it's likely to bring their payroll above this though.  Side note: OKC is still paying Kyle Singler 1M/year this season and next."
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
FMVP &gt; All-NBA 1st &gt; DPOY but all need context in a league where Andre Iguodala can win FMVP and DeAndre Jordan can win All-NBA 1st team
DeAndre Jordan
"Ah yes, if only Simmons had a deandre Jordan or Clint capella? Oh wait, those guys only got oops because harden and Paul could shoot, create space, etc.  So, is the pantheon of terrible Ben’s where does he rank Ben Netanyahu, Benedict Arnold…..Benito Mussolini   Nah, he’s even worse. I think he ties Ben Shapiro for worst Ben"
We have two centers not named AD. And one of them is deandre Jordan who is washed af and should only play if AD or Dwight is hurt
Lol and he should be fine health wise with Dwight and even Deandre Jordan to back him up and bang with bigs
"Elton Brand, Sam Cassell, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Paul George have all stood top 10 in MVP voting. And this isn't counting the San Diego years. Three 6MOTYs in Lamar Odom, Jamal Crawford, Lou Will. DPOY candidate in DeAndre Jordan.  You might want to revisit your narrative."

Cap circumvention. A team can't give their player direct financial incentive outside of the cap. Kinda like this story:   https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/08/25/nba-fines-clippers-for-attempting-to-circumvent-salary-cap-with-deandre-jordan/
Dame and DeAndre Jordan would've been good answers up until a couple seasons ago. They had insane attendance records afaik
We’ll take him 👀 let’s talk. We’ll give you Austin reeves and deandre Jordan. Sound good?
You’ve literally been a lottery team for the last 10 years and for the next 5 you’ll peak in the second round. It’s a shame Giannis had to destroy your broke franchise cause y’all ain’t getting a ring anytime soon with 50 year old Chris Paul and deandre “Jordan” Ayton
"Dont care about that, but this is curious....  &gt;“But the Lakers still had a 14th roster spot after signing Rondo and DeAndre Jordan,” I can hear some bringing up, and while that is true, it’s also hard to argue that giving it to a rookie like Austin Reaves with some theoretical upside doesn’t make more sense with so many veterans already on the roster. There is also the reality that Reaves, a player with zero years of NBA experience, costs approximately $1.5 million less to sign than a 14-year vet like Dudley (per Larry Coon’s CBA FAQ), and that’s before factoring in the Lakers’ already-oppressive tax bill, which goes higher for every dollar they spend over the cap.  Penny pinching on that level of minimum contracts isnt a good look"
Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf   Marco Belinelli  Vince Carter  Jared Dudley  Deandre Jordan  Big oof
Our current DeAndre Jordan is what I meant sorry. Yea he might be better than peak Kwame in the rn. i mean he's only several years removed from hos 1st team all nba prime.
Dwight was drafted before DeAndre Jordan was in the league unless you mean a different DJ
"Actual Starting 5 - Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson , Andrew Wiggins , Draymond Green , James Wiseman   Their Draft comparisions - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf , Marco Belinelli , Vince Carter/Rudy Gay , Jared Dudley/Luke Harangody , Hassan Whiteside/DeAndre Jordan"
Why does this smell like Doc Rivers tryna pull a DeAndre Jordan lock down on Ben.
"If you're good enough to get to the NBA to with a very limited skill set, then at that point it is all work ethic and mentality. The guy is already an elite athlete above anyone in the G League, but he hasn't capitalised on that to become a great NBA player.  Wherever that comes from, be it mental health, environment, or just not actually liking basketball enough to care, that's what's stopping him in the NBA more than anything. If Deandre Jordan can become a 70% free throw shooter, Ben can develop a shot."
Can't forget DeAndre Jordan on Brandon Knight  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTkN2q6sUUk&amp;t=5
"This is painfully close to an inversion of the Clippers locking DeAndre Jordan in his own house, except literally no one is driving around town trying to get ahold of Ben to get him to join their team.  Where the fuck are Ben Simmons' emojis?"
"Doc Rivers tryna pull a DeAndre Jordan situation, Ben isn't falling for it."
"Do it if you can. It's worth it. I've seen 2 NBA games in my day. 1 was up close in Denver (we were maybe 5 rows back). Then the other was up in the nose bleeds in San Antonio. I swear, those 2 games might as well have been 2 different leagues.   In Denver, I got to see Javale McGee, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan all in their prime, and it was nuts watching each of them jump from up close. Even the warmups were impressive.  When you're far back, it's similar to watching it on TV as far as viewing angle, so you don't notice athleticism as much. But up close is just wild. I remember seeing Javale McGee jump for an alley oop and just thinking to myself ""No man that big should be able to get up that high."" But on TV you might notice height, but you don't notice size as much, so it doesn't mess with your brain in the same way."
They were about DeAndre Jordan his ass. Ben didnt bite lol.
They're not even trying man. They need to take notes from Blake Griffin and Chris Paul during the Deandre Jordan Mavs/Clippers debacle in 2015.  They haven't even staked out his house yet. Amateurs!  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2520413-deandre-jordan-apologizes-to-mark-cuban-mavericks-after-signing-with-clippers.amp.html
Lmfaoo this dude said I ain’t gonna be Deandre Jordan. Man he *really* doesn’t like the 6ers
Lmao I knew Doc was gonna try to pull some Deandre Jordan shit
"Damn, we could have had a reverse Deandre Jordan situation"
Shades of DeAndre Jordan in Dallas
what's there to say? it's worse than the 70 whatever % you posted earlier and his made shots were all still wide open dunks  that's like me calling DeAndre Jordan someone with elite touch when all he does is finish open dunks
Deandre Jordan has an all NBA first team. 2010s All NBA Center is the weakest all nba position group in decades
"8 All-Stars and 4-ALL NBA and one season top 5 in MVP voting. Worth pointing out he shared two of his ALL-NBA teams with DeAndre Jordan to give some idea of the state of centre positions. I don't say this to say he is not great, but I don't think his resume is that strong."
Deandre jordan?
"Not trying to take away from AD, but before Jokic/KAT and Embiid got in the league the centre position was pretty rough. Andre Drummond made an ALL-NBA team during that era. Al Jefferson. DeAndre Jordan made 3 All-NBA teams sharing 2 of them with AD. The guard position has been incredibly stacked. Steph, Harden, Russ, CP3, Kyrie. It's a pretty unfair metric to compare Dame and AD."
"LeBron plus AD is an incredible combo and both guys are superstars. But outside of them their team construction is horrendous, and way less than the sum of their parts. You need to surround LeBron and AD with good defenders and outside shooters and they would be instant top contenders. Instead they got Westbrook, Carmelo, Dwight Howard, DeAndre and Rondo. In addition to being washed, none of those guys can shoot at all besides maybe Carmelo.  And Tucker, Bazemore, Monk and Bradley aren't exactly super elite shooters either. They literally have no outside weapons for LeBron or AD to pass to or spread the floor. They have 3 playmakers in LeBron, Westbrook and Rondo and no shooters to pass it to. And on defense I don't know how good Howard or Jordan are anymore. And Westbrook, Rondo and Carmelo are all bad to terrible.  Just the greatness of LeBron and AD will probably carry this team to a respectably good record. But the team around them looks awful, especially when they're paying a guy like Westbrook $44 million."
&gt;I dont get why he and Deandre Jordan played the same amount of minutes. Just give Dwight 25 minutes and tell Deandre to kick rocks.  Yesterday was perhaps the first time I could criticize Vogel's lineup management on r/lakers without getting downvoted.
Youre starting Deandre Jordan over Dwight he’s obviously correct that Drummond is better than Dwight lmao
If he can stay healthy I think he can be Deandre Jordan/Clint Capela with better passing.
Hes not meant to be a finishing big. That's not his role nor should he be given that role. He gets hella boards and plays defense in the paint. 16 boards tonight. He's got playmaking skills if one or both of his feet are touching the paint. And he can get hustle buckets. Meanwhile dwight gets a ton of fouls because he doesn't move well anymore on defense and he can't play long minutes like Drummond can. You see that video of dwight and DeAndre Jordan running after their first game? Looking like the damn tin man from wizard of oz
It's pretty easy to avoid running Deandre Jordan and Rondo with Russ; that's not too much accommodation.
Houston played PJ Tucker at center not Deandre Jordan. It was 4 shooters around Russ.
"Yo Cavs, if you want another big man you can have one DeAndre Jordan"
"not really otherwise he'd still be here because that's what we need too. He's notably worse than DeAndre Jordan, who they traded 4 2nds to make fuck off"
Shannon is correct on this one. The Lakers didn’t make this move without Lebron approving of it. Westbrook is a high variance player that could be anywhere on at the bottom of the performance scale to the middle and then occasionally near the top with a dominant performance.  Westbrook shouldn’t be the scapegoat here because non of this is new or surprising. Westbrook usually gets better as the season progresses and then the variance begins again in the playoffs.   Honestly Westbrook isn’t even the biggest issue in the Lakers starting lineup...Deandre jordan at center is the weak link. Obviously Vogel agrees with this because he actually played less than Westbrook did.   Lebron can’t claim ignorance on this one. He either has a plan to make it work or...he just wanted to play with Westbrook in LA.
"Let's see:  Fisher (before he got traded), Kobe, Metta, Pau, Bynum  vs  Westbrook, Bazemore, LeBron, AD, DeAndre Jordan"
"Maybe they could get a guy like Deandre Jordan, I heard he’s friends with KD"
"&gt;Honestly his FG% raised bc he started shooting less, and CP3 is perfect for a game like him who needs assisted shots a la DeAndre Jordan.  You're acting like his near 60% shooting pre cp3 was a bad thing?"
"You can tell Ayton does not have the potential of harden from pretty much watching. It may but it doesn’t look like that outside game or ball skill is gunna come along, it’s what everyone was predicting when he was first drafted but as the years go by it seems less and less likely. Honestly his FG% raised bc he started shooting less, and CP3 is perfect for a game like him who needs assisted shots a la DeAndre Jordan."
I dont get why he and Deandre Jordan played the same amount of minutes. Just give Dwight 25 minutes and tell Deandre to kick rocks.
"He's improved somewhat but in my opinion not a whole lot for a guy from age 19-22.    Anthony Davis went from decent starter to all-star in that time frame.  Gobert went from not really playing to starting all the games and leading the Jazz from 29th to 7th in defensive rating.  Deandre Jordan went from scrub to starter, Draymond went from draft afterthought to the reason the Warriors cut bait on David Lee, a borderline all-star in his prime.  Ayton has gotten a little better but I think you'd expect more growth from someone over their late teens/early twenties, especially if they were looking at his ft% in college and hoping he'd develop some perimeter skills."
That’s why u don’t start fucking DeAndre Jordan. Lol Vogel lineups were ass last night. U take away WB best attribute from the get go
Playing Deandre Jordan for 13 minutes and starting him is so weird
"Javale still started until Game 3. What is the point of that token start if you're going to cut his minutes? To ensure the opponent has a good start?  If the Lakers make the playoffs, you will still see Deandre Jordan starting playoff games for the Lakers."
We started Deandre Jordan. I don’t know what the fuck pelinka was thinking
I honestly thought it was DeAndre Jordan and a bloody Brandon Knight underneath.
"The Lakers should have went after him instead of Russ, Dwight and DeAndre Jordan."
"Because not even Day to Davis and LeGOAT can carry trash like DeAndre Jordan, WestBrick, and Melo"
"people will say it's overreaction, but this team has no shot of winning anything. not with rondo, westbrook, monk, melo and deandre jordan defensively. you have no real 2 way players, because you lost them all in a trade for a guy who's on a 40 milion dollar contract and can't do anything, great job lakers front office. hield, kcp, probably caruso and a pick would've been so much better,  what a disaster."
Deandre Jordan looked like shit. The Rondo - Westbrook backcourt was shit defensively. Dwight looked lost vs Bjelica. I mean the Warriors went on a run every time LeBron sat
Deandre Jordan and Russell Eastbrook
How is Deandre Jordan still in the league? He should be replaced by Christmas lol
Never commit to DeAndre Jordan.
Lakers are trolling with this deandre Jordan lineup.
Deandre Jordan is so ass man he ain’t doing nothing
DeAndre Jordan is the definition of a placeholder starter
"no other team with rondo, Westbrook, and Deandre Jordan has scored 34 points in a quarter in nba history"
Apparently washed DeAndre Jordan is better at catching these passes than Nic Claxton
Deandre Jordan is starting in an NBA game in 2021. What timeline is this
Deandre Jordan shouldn’t be starting on any team
DeAndre Jordan for MVP??
starting deandre jordan in 2021 is certainly a choice
He's looking like DeAndre Jordan out there tonight lol
Dammit just play the 5 already instead of having DeAndre freaking Jordan on the floor. Y’all already have Westbrick’s shooting to deal with
DeAndre Jordan on a contender for the first time in his career
Claxton look long like a old deandre Jordan out there
This is just assuming Vogel is an idiot and will have a scheme involving deandre jordan switching on Steph Curry
The Lakers are starting DeAndre freaking Jordan. Yea. Warriors taking this one lol
How did Deandre Jordan get a starting job?
Lmao. Deandre fucking Jordan? Okay then
LOL DeAndre Jordan? Congats on the W GS.
DeAndre Jordan?  Warriors win by 20
DeAndre Jordan?  Warriors win
DeAndre Jordan starting over Dwight? Is he hurt or something?
DeAndre Jordan
"You're right but again, it's not like he's gonna get any smaller, we still have the corpse of DeAndre Jordan walking around trying to get rings"
"Dawg everyone plays a bit better with CP3. Deandre Jordan also had his highest career FG and even made all nba first team with CP3 and let me tell it wasn’t bc bro was so skilled. Human torch? U didn’t watch the games it’s official, he was hitting primarily dunks and layups and not on super volume either. He’s a 15-10 guy, ur seriously prematurely overestimating his abilities. I don’t see how u could think a guy who is so obviously limited with not much ceiling left could be definitely worth a max by performing well in a playoffs where majority of the field was injured."
"Giannis, Giannis, Jokič, won last 3 MVPs, both bigs from Europe with a lot of skills, Embid also came close to MVP if he played more , also a big with a lot of skills.  &amp;#x200B;  Just because US bigs are like Dwight Howard or Deandre Jordan Or Ayton with all the strenght and size and muscles and no skills or BB iq and bad footwork it doesnt mean that other parts of the world cant produce BASKETBALL players. You in US are so determined to label and box everybody as a big wing etc, but you should be more focused on making basketball players no matter if they are big small fat athletic. Everybody needs to learn ALL THE SKILLS from young age and only after they are 18 they should get a possition they will play ."
I mean DeAndre Jordan was pretty bad his first couple of seasons
"So who the hell is starting tomorrow? LeBron, AD, Westbrook..... Bazemore? Looks like DeAndre Jordan started some preseason games, so I guess him too?"
"Then he can prove that this seasons. So many players have gotten heavy contracts after one playoffs and didn’t live up to it. Ayton got better with CP3 like every does, DeAndre Jordan was all NBA first team with CP3. He’s a big that’s a great defender but not the best and limited offensive skills seeing how he does for another y against the full teams makes 1000% sense. If he does well u match whatever max he gets, if not, well no love lost."
"you absolutely haven't dude lol. Ben Simmons DOES score more efficiently than Klay Thompson. We can just use context to explain that Ben is finishing easy possessions and scoring at the rim. It doesn't mean he is a better shooter, nobody is saying Deandre Jordan is a better shooter than Steve Nash but his FG% is way better."

"So by this logic, Deandre Jordan is the most effient player of all time. He leads all time  64%TS. Or are you just going by name value?"
DeAndre Jordan 2.0
Shouldn’t pay a max contract for someone who is just a better version of Deandre Jordan
&gt; He was an elite lob catcher playing with one of the best passers of all time.  See: DeAndre Jordan.
"I’d agree with you if the NBA was only based on scoring, but there’s more to the game than that. What DA does is invaluable for the Suns, and they can’t replace it if he walks after this. All the good teams have dominant big men (AD, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Bam) and Ayton counters them perfectly while also contributing on the offensive end. He ain’t no Drummond/Deandre Jordan empty stats lob catcher who can’t score either lol"
"If he was DeAndre Jordan 2.0, the prime Jordan of 15-17, his agent would’ve had a much better time arguing for him.  Jordan had the most lob gravity i in the league at his peak. And was a monster at the rim on both ends and on the glass."
"This is redundant. He may be DPOYx4 but Wallace had no shooting ability, no post moves and an absolutely abysmal free throw shooter. His game was one dimensional and he wouldn’t be any different tham Deandre Jordan in today’s NBA."
Thank you for also pointing this out. The narrative has been so skewed people think he's deandre jordan or somethin now
He sacrificed his game so much for the good of the team. Now people think he's deandre jordan 2.0 and it lowkey screwed him. 0 chance he makes any sacrifices this year
"Ayton is not a max player. I see him as another DeAndre Jordan with better FT%. He also has the luxury of playing with CP3 as his pg.  We all know what he did for DJ.  Deandre Ayton = DeAndre Jordan.   Sorry buddy, but it's Booker's team. Don't get offended with the no offer and keep working on your game."
All depends. I honestly think most people here have watched very little of DA and don't understand what he does for this team. Y'all are acting like he's Jahlil Okafor or 30+ year old DeAndre Jordan. He's not that type of center - an actually close comparison is Bam.
Deandre Jordan looked really good playing with cp3. Same with Ayton. He does typical big man things. The only thing that I’ll give him is that he can defend the pick and rolls pretty well at an elite level. But he’s nothing too special out of it.
Shouldn’t pay a max contract for someone who is just a better version of Deandre Jordan
"People just wants to shit on Savor when they're too blind to see the CP3 inflation for every single lob catching bigs he played with- Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, and Clint Capella."
"Well, Hornets Chandler was good but not DPoY levels yet like he was in Dallas and NY.   Deandre Jordan, kinda iffy with him. He wasn’t really that good to me. He was all-nba by default at the time.   Capela is a great rim protector and can switch on to some perimeter guys off the switch and was considered a fringe all-star/S+role player at the time.   DeAndre Ayton is young but is showing signs of his offensive potential. Defense can use some work but yea, still young.   So Imma have to go Ayton, Capela, Chandler, DJ."
DeAndre Jordan
"DeAndre Jordan on Wayne Ellington: ""We are twins. We're just different colors"""
"Talking about guys who mainly play center. Of course Giannis is going to be more versatile. You can probably write AD in at center, and he is better defensively, for sure. But those issues about rotations and help defense have gotten better in his sophomore season and mostly disappeared over the course of this season. Talking about versatility, among centers, he defends as many mid-range and corner 3 attempts as AD, affects the mid-range as much as Bam, and protects the rim better than Bam. But that's DFGA and DFG% which is always a bit, bleh. It can show DeAndre Jordan as a DPOY candidate.  Plenty of defensive assessment is looking at how a player blows up plays and affects opponents shots. [Here is an article about one of those Clippers games, where you can see how well he played even against the 5-out.](https://thefourpointplay.substack.com/p/vol2-iss19-deandre-ayton-has-arrived) Yes, it's from a Suns fan, but this dude goes over film like no one's business. It's also taking clips from one of his better games in the playoffs, but having watched all the Suns games last season, I promise he started looking like this around the all-star break and turned it up to force LeBron to the 3 point line and AD into the mid-range, shut down the offense running through the MVP, drove the Clippers to play 5-out and still struggle. He just fell short against a monstrous Giannis, but so did the rest of the league."
Brandon Knight's career was basically over after getting dunked on by DeAndre Jordan.
"He's definitely not DeAndre Jordan to a tee, but he still could have performed in a similar role in some regards. In fact, during the SVG era, he kind of did, and that's arguably when he was at his most effective. Reggie Jackson/Brandon Jennings/D.J. Augustin would utilize his screens then feed him scraps at the rim - he yielded his first all-star selection off of that.   But the extra stuff just became too tantalizing over the years."
"I dunno if he has prime Deandre Jordan athleticism, dude was jumping outta the gym at his size. Drummond has always looked very awkward on the court to me. From the not so many Pistons games I watched during his time there, I honestly think his rebounding has more to do with a good sense of where to extend his arms than his leaping or box outs."
"I've always been willing to meet Andre halfway on this. I had a feeling pretty early on (probably when he was around 21 or so) that no matter how much he worked, he might always struggle with his back to the basket and with rudimentary shot-making skills.   The thing is, he kept insisting upon playing like he *could* make those shots (ditto goes for the impossible pass attempts and perimeter isolations). If he'd have just gone the Clippers-era DeAndre Jordan route (accepting you can't do anything but screen and dunk but doing that aspect quite well) then he could have had a more positive impact on his teams than he has in recent years."
"I'm not sure why I'd need to pick between Andre Drummond thinking he's Michael Jordan and Andre Drummond thinking he's Ben Simmons.   Knowing your role is a *huge* part of understanding how to play effective basketball. Cavaliers-era Tristan Thompson was an asset because he tried to play like Tristan Thompson, not LeBron2. Clint Capela is an asset, despite his limitations, because he *knows* those limitations.   There's a reason why we never saw Mavericks-era Tyson Chandler calling for an iso on the wing or Clippers-era DeAndre Jordan looking off Chris Paul following a defensive rebound so he could run point on the break himself. Those guys knew their roles.   Whenever Andre happened to have a game where he was able to limit himself from trying to do all the things he's terrible at, he proved he could be an asset. But more times than not, especially late in his Pistons career, dude just couldn't resist a tasty 3-point attempt or one-on-one dual culminating in an off-balance contested banking runner."
Deandre Jordan /s
"Warriors are going to be good this year, we're already undefeated in the pre season, our young core experiments look to be paying off big time especially with Jordan Poole.  Klay is coming back this season.     Warriors games usually happen around 7:30 pm PST which according to a time zone converter I used would make start time around 10:30 am AST.  Pretty friendly overseas schedule IMO.  I've seen comments from euro fans on this sub talking about staying up till 2-4am just to watch a game.     I think Deandre Jordan's Lakers will have similar start times since they're also a California team so you could hypothetically watch both teams fairly easily this season"
"The squad is decent, its just that theres not really anyone else to pick from in Clippers history. Next people up are like Deandre Jordan and Corey Magettee lmao"
"Hi all,  I’m an Aussie just getting into NBA, really love the league and wanna know where to start with picking a team. I’m a big fan of Deandre Jordan and Steph Curry, so should I just follow their teams?"
"Honestly have no idea what they’re talking about. We were a top 10 D towards the beginning of the year because we had good 3pt FG% luck and once that started to regress back to the mean it wasn’t good. Even if that was true, Drummond certainly isn’t a good defender - DRPM has him around the level of TT and Deandre Jordan last year. Furthermore his offensive contributions were so bad they would lead to easy buckets for the other team. Also Sexton is a hard worker and great example I have no idea what this is about. Is someone just trying to drive down Sexton’s trade value?"
Because deandre Jordan has some skill. Moses Brown has legitimately no skill at all. He may have had an efficient season but he was always a minus on the floor and never helped the team. Sam presti got rid of him for a reason.
"Brown only just turned 22, and is a legit 7'2"". He's put up better and more efficient numbers than someone like DeAndre Jordan had up to the same age (Jordan turned 22 before the 2010-2011 season). Why couldn't Brown grow and end up as a similarly effective player as DeAndre was in his prime once he reaches his (likely 2-3 years away from even entering it)?"
His modern version is DeAndre Jordan. Is he a starter in the league? Nope.
Get every player he wants? You think he wants Westbrook and Deandre Jordan over Kevin Durant and Steph Curry? You're acting like he can just pick anyone to be on his roster.
They also ditched Deandre Jordan with zero hassle after he helped get KD and Kyrie onboard. The NBA's a business.
"Ive never seen this much effort from DeAndre Jordan since he was a Clipper, I know it’s not the regular season but damn Im shocked"
"I swear if DeAndre Jordan was at least below average, the Nets could've used him and would've win vs the Bucks. They just needed a body"
And you think DeAndre Jordan can replicate Dwight and McGee? Ok. Good luck.
"Yes. Deandre Jordan for some reason gets blamed the most about his defense on the Nets when in reality he was probably one of the better defenders on the roster. You can only cover up Shamet, Kyrie, and Chris Chiozza so well on that end"
"You're absolutely right. People who shit on the idea that Ariza could start for the Lakers need to realize that it probably comes down to him starting at the 4 and sliding AD to 5, or DeAndre Jordan starting at the 5 and sliding AD to 4. The people like that person you're responding to who just want to write off Ariza because of a 4 game sample size in last year's playoffs are not being realistic about Ariza's potential importance to this particular Laker team.   If the Lakers start Ariza at the 4 with Melo coming off the bench there and then both LeBron and AD also taking a few minutes at PF, that's almost surely going to be a much more productive rotation for the Lakers than leaning heavily on DAJ and Dwight because the Lakers are light on forwards. I don't think Ariza will play 30+ mpg or something, but I think the plan all along has been for him to start and give them maybe 15-20 mpg there."
I went to see Nets vs Warriors in 2020 to see DeAndre Jordan vs Wiggins. We're built different.
"I checked - in terms of talent potential most definitely. I went back to the 80s and couldn't find another team even close to that prospect level - I mean they had all 5 top 5 players from the draft playing in it and they never came close to that before.  They did have Steph, PatBev, DeAndre Jordan, and Beasley in 2007. And Seth, Klay, and Hayward in 2009. But if Mobley, Haliburton, and Barnes continue their trajectory and even 1 of Cade, Jalen Green, or Suggs turn into a superstar then this is definitely goat U19 squad by future talent."
"Frank and McGee have been great in his absence. Just like Capela, DeAndre Jordan and Tyson Chandler. Wow Chris Paul is so lucky with his big men. Kaminsky and Ayton should definitely get the max"
"Drummond has basically been a younger, slightly different variant of Deandre Jordan his entire career too."
"I wonder if this year’s lakers team is one of the best “if everyone was in their primes” teams ever?  Prime Lebron, Melo, Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Rondo, DeAndre Jordan as a backup center  There are some fit issues but the talent of that team would be insane"
"Nah I'm saying that sometimes the competition for spots is ridiculously tight that someone might be an all-time great player and still not make the cut for the absolute top tier teams.      - Patrick Ewing is only 1x All-NBA first because he had to compete with Hakeem, Shaq and Robinson.        - DeAndre Jordan is a 1x All-NBA first because he had to compete with Drummond, Houston Dwight and Whiteside.      Nobody would see DeAndre is on par with Ewing peak for peak and the same logic applies with Stockton here."
Lakers tryna overcome Westbrook and Deandre Jordan. Vogel is beyond clueless
Haslem might be a better player than Deandre Jordan rn
" How lucky is Chris Paul with his big men? Had a dominant Tyson Chandler, Deandre Jordan, Clint Capela, and now Ayton, McGee, and Frank on one team! They all deserve maxes"
Deandre Jordan simply isn’t an NBA caliber player anymore. He really shouldn’t be getting any minutes.
Can’t believe we were the 2 seed last year with Deandre Jordan starting 43 games. That’s more impressive than us being the 2 seed with only 8 games played with the Big 3
The way people tend to describe Drummond is basically current Deandre Jordan. That’s how far the hate has gotten
Can’t believe lakers replaced him for Deandre jordan
Mark Cuban trying to sign deandre jordan
I think Mark Cuban chasing DeAndre Jordan
"""his 5 1st teams and 1 2nd team match up just well""   Context matters, this was the weakest era of centers in NBA history by an enormous margin, as the era of the dinosaur paint bigs waned. Dwight had no go to move whatsoever over his entire career, which impacted his ability to come up big in the clutch in the playoffs regardless of what numbers he put up throughout the game before crunch time. Deandre Jordan of all people made a 1st team All-NBA before the center position evolved into what it is today.  If we're going to include a talented-but-limited center with lofty counting stats, deep character issues, and the disrespect of his peers, Elvin Hayes has to slot in there above Dwight.  Cowens can't be denied. He was an MVP and should have won Finals MVP in '76, he was the best player on that team and scored only 1 point fewer than JoJo per game, while leading the team to that title with his maniacal rebounding &amp; defense"
Looks like Tyson Chandler isn't even in CP3's top 5 most assisted players! Here's CP3's table expanded to 10 players:  | Assists TO Player | Player Name | |:------:|:------:| | Blake Griffin | 1157 | | David West | 1120 | | J.J.

Went to a sixers and clips game. Their speed honestly wasn’t that surprising but their size was ungodly. Blake Griffen and deandre Jordan calves were the sizes of tree trunks. I was like 8th row and could still see just how massive those calves were. Been to football games. Other bball games. Something about those 2 dudes calves freaked me out
Lebron knew what he was doing getting Deandre Jordan as the everyday center
"I agree that Deandre Jordan is bad, but he is a poor example for the question.  Jordan’s advanced stats would indicate he is a good player. He’s averaging the highest WS/48 and PER of his career.  A lot of bigs that barely play have really good advanced stats because they typically get a lot of rebounds in a short time and are gifted easy baskets (like you said)."
Current DeAndre Jordan  Unless for some reason you care about a guy having a high TS% on 2 lobs a game
"[He's fishing for this, LOL](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2719108-banana-boats-and-emoji-wars-the-day-deandre-jordan-turned-twitter-upside-down)"
"I know he carried the scoring in the 1st quarter this game, but so far this season, it's DeAndre Jordan."
"Oh don't worry, Westbrook is there to always be the scapegoat. And if it's not him it's going to be (in this order): DeAndre Jordan, Rondo, Vogel, Bazemore, Davis, and Kuzma even if he's on the Wizards now.  Melo is safe."
"What do you mean? How often do you see Deandre Jordan score 10 points in around 8 minutes?  I feel the complete opposite way. Russell is a pretty bad passer in the sense that his passes are not very accurate. A lot of his turnovers are a result of his passes being a bit too high/low, a bit too fast/slow, or otherwise just being a little bit off. But a lot of times if his passes were closer to perfection he would be getting his teammates easy points."
If the lakers had only DeAndre Jordan they'd be 0-10
Confirmed Deandre Jordan fan
When did deandre Jordan play with lebron?
Drummond is not as bad as his reputation. Not in the same league as deandre Jordan lol
He played with deandre Jordan?
Nets fans deserve compensation for watching DeAndre Jordan for an entire season. That's all I'm saying
"Even though Russ makes terrible decisions, he still does some great stuff on the floor. But there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOOD THAT DEANDRE JORDAN DOES."
DeAndre Jordan. Russ is a close 2nd.
"The Athletic article said Simmons has mentioned his mental health to the Sixers before:  &gt; Sources added that Simmons has informed the franchise for months that he is not feeling mentally ready, but that the organization has insisted on attempts to get him to play again.  So Morey doesn't say anything to Doc for his statements in the presser (and before anyone says, ""he should've lied?"" Yes, this is the same guy who said DeAndre Jordan could be DPOY. He's used to lying to players for their benefit). Was already dangling him around - We saw the reports of Simmons being ready to go to Houston. Then proceeded to spend the entire summer trying to trade the guy, only to say, ""Welp nevermind,"" after it turns out that he can't trade for Damien Lillard. And then expected him to show up like it's all good.  Can't say I'm surprised this is the current situation of the Sixers when the same GM let Harden run wild over Houston."
Hyland DeAndre Jordan
Same way you win one with DeAndre Jordan as starter. Just play him 10 mins
They need to cut Deandre Jordan first. His presence on the court makes their defensive rating abysmal
You could also name it Deandre Jordan is washed theory
"DeAndre Jordan, he's has no ability to defend whatsoever. Good when we're playing him, bad when he starts for you over Jarrett Allen bc he friends with your superstars ☠️"
"DeAndre Jordan. After seeing him on the Lob City Clippers many years ago, I wanted him on the Nets. Eventually once he got here, he became ass. He didn't even get playing time in the Playoffs last season. At first I didn't want him to leave because KD and Kyrie would get upset over it, but we had no choice. Now he's the Lakers' problem."
DeAndre Jordan earlier in the decade is a good example. National medias/fans opinion of his defensive ability was way higher than that of us who watched him play
"Very rare to see a legit 7ft player move that fluidly. Being that coordinated, smooth and quick is more rare than being super fast and explosive like a prime Deandre Jordan and Dwight Howard. As athletic as they were, they still moved kinda stiff. Only Hakeem, KG, young Kareem, Bill Walton, Bosh moved that fluidly as legit PF/C prospects. I won't include Dirk and Durant as both were never bigmen in my book."
DeAndre Jordan is CP3's greatest achievement.
Every point he scores with Deandre Jordan in the lineup should count as an extra .5 or something. He looks way better when he’s playing the 5. I just wish he wasn’t soft and demanded to play it the entire game.
We replaced D’Antoni with Steve Clifford who is a very respected defensive coach. Personnel also improved (even last year the Nets were pretty average as a defensive team when DeAndre Jordan wasn’t playing and historically bad when he was on the court).
"They stopped playing DeAndre Jordan, which helped"
"Addition by subtraction honestly. Not having to play Deandre Jordan alone improves the nets from a bottom tier defense in the reg season to above average in the playoffs.     Also, you can see this reverse effect on the Lakers. The Lakers had one of the best defenses in the league last year, but they're a bottom tier defense this year while playing DJ."
"They were literally letting him sacrifice defense to stat pad rebounds by completely leaving his defender.   That year, Deandre Jordan and Gobert had more contested perimeter shots then Westbrook."
Deandre Jordan would still be starting center though.  Dwight is off the bench
The fuck is a JPL? This is stupider than when people started calling DeAndre Jordan DAJ or Ayton DA... Like it takes one less stroke on the keyboard to type JPL out than it does to type Poole.
Idk who has the best but one contender would be DeAndre Jordan you could just throw it up and he'd catch it either hand and throw it down. Don't see many guys throwing down lobs with their off hand
Nets cut him during training camp/preseason. He was acquired in the DeAndre Jordan salary dump and didn’t make the Brooklyn roster.

"To be fair to the Lakers, Avery Bradley and DeAndre Jordan might very well be out of the rotation entirely when the Lakers get all their injured players back. Bradley was grabbed as a stop gap to tide the Lakers over until Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn are healthy (Bradley's contract isn't guaranteed, so he can just be released if needed). And the Lakers have said they want to play AD more at center, but currently the only forward they had available tonight was Melo, so they kinda have to play Jordan and Dwight.   If you look at the guys the Lakers have who can play forward it's LeBron, AD, Melo, Ariza and THT, and tonight only Melo was available. If you look at who the Lakers have who can handle the ball it's LeBron, Westbrook, Nunn, THT and Rondo, and only Russ and Rondo were available. But they're pretty well set with  bench level shooting guards and centers, so there's that. The Lakers are absolutely decimated in really specific ways and are just scrambling to field even remotely workable lineups. They're gonna be bad until they get some of these players back healthy, there's really no way around that."
"deandre ""despite the loss"" jordan"
If you watched us last year you would know we would give up 120+ to any team regardless of how good they were. Saying our defensive rating is good only because we played the Pistons twice is a bad take considering our playoff defense was ranked 3rd and our defense last year tanked because Deandre Jordan is the worst player in the league
Deandre Jordan is our leading scorer
I'm in so much pain watching DeAndre Jordan play minutes. He shouldn't be a starter. At most he should be a guy to play poker with on the airplane.
"ugh, we're getting to the point where cuban needs to hire a real GM and empower him to actually make decisions rather than just being a figurehead  cuban's way of doing business just looks worse and worse with every passing year.  this style of doing all our business deals and signings in the club like it's one big nonstop frat party down in dallas is probably rubbing some guys the wrong way, guys who take their careers seriously.   all that stuff about chandler parsons wagging the dog gives me the impression that cuban handles his team business in kind of an unprofessional way  like I imagine he pitched richaun holmes and demar derozan and lowry in the same manner that he courted deandre jordan back in the day.    and just nobody ever ever wants to sign in dallas, its clearly not working.   this last offseason was a big chance to bring in talent before luka's supermax kicks in and it was just a total whiff"
"Love seeing Eric Gordon jumping down, grabbing his head lol. Reminds me of CP and Deandre Jordan at the end of that one game."
"Who is better, DeAndre Jordan or Dame? But muh size!"
How about one slightly used DeAndre Jordan :)
"I feel his stuff comes a tad forced but it's fine overall mostly I feel they're all his stuff. I like him and their combinations. Meanwhile, I have to hear bill macdonald who gets excited for every little thing while taking from Chick Hearn but also now Ralph Lawler with deandre Jordan on the team."
"Uhhh no, just no. Sure his old teams in cleveland where built to lebrons strengths but his Lakers teams haven’t been at all. Are you just fucking with me man lol? How have the Lakers been built around lebrons strengths? They’ve been running two true bigs in their lineups with AD &amp; Dwight/McGee/Jordan or Gasol, clogging the paint. They’ve had no 3 point snipers, instead relying on mediocre shooters like KCP and Kuzma. None of these Lakers teams have been built around his strengths, they’ve gone a totally different route with it.   Literally one if the biggest criticism lebrons Lakers have received since he got there is that they haven’t built any of the teams around Lebron the way you would expect them too. They haven’t surrounded him with snipers and emptied the paint, they’ve done the opposite. His teams are usually some of the better 3 point shooting teams in the league but in LA they haven’t been at all.   And they literally passed on Hield to get Russ, another move that is clearly not about building to lebrons strengths. They traded Gasol to get Deandre, another move that is absolutely the opposite of building around lebrons strengths. They chose THT over Caruso, another move that is clearly the opposite of building around lebrons strengths.   This current Lakers team isnt built around his strengths at all. They starting Russ and Deandre next to Lebron. This team should be fine without Lebron, the have AD, Russ, Melo, Rondo and Dwight and they can’t beat the Thunder?  Youre probably the first person I’ve ever argued with whos tried to say these Lakers teams are properly built around lebrons strengths. Everyone else has made the opposite point about how they’ve consistently built these Lakers teams in a very weird way that don’t really fit around Lebron but for whatever reason you’re pretending like that’s not the case."
Had to make room for Deandre Jordan
"I will never understand what supposedly makes them the “favorite.” Maybe that’s just the weight of Lebron’s star power? Look… the lakers are *old as hell.* And ontop of that they can’t seem to stay healthy. Didn’t lebron just pull some muscle or something? And we all know AD aint gonna play the whole season. Oh but that’s ok because you can always rely upon spry fountains of youth like Rajon Rando? Or wait, no… Dwight Howard no wait… Deandre Jordan no wait…  I’m not expecting much from LA this year. They’re good for a 2nd round out imo."
&gt;No 3 pt shooting  8th in the league in percentage.   2nd in the league in FG percentage.  &gt;DeAndre Jordan starting  He plays 13 minutes a game.  &gt;Defense is gone.  Brand new roster. Takes time to get rotations and chemistry going.  &gt;Window is closing imo   LOL
"Pelinka definitely also did a bad job building this roster.    It is very short sighted.  Good luck developing any talent for the future when the roster is loaded with deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony and Russ Westbrook.  They also no longer have any pieces for trades or to deal.   They are built to win now but I think they will struggle with winning anything meaningful. I absolutely would not be surprised with a first round playoff exit.  But the bad part of all that is if that happens, Lebron will not be accountable because he is a pseudo gm...he has all the influence but no actual accountability when it comes to these bad decisions."
"Yes the roster construction isn’t that great I agree, but listen to what you said, 5 players combined for 19 shots and missed 17. Westbrook alone took 23 and missed 13. That is why he takes the brunt of the loss, or are we just admitting Kent bazemore, deandre Jordan, or Malik monk should’ve had more opportunities. Or possibly not dribbling into a contested three for the game? I went through this and I’ll tell you, Westbrook making shots in the early game is bittersweet, because then come fourth quarter…"
In his MVP season he contested less 3s than... DeAndre Jordan. So ya.
"Defense is gone.  WB is not gonna be a different player.  No 3 pt shooting, DeAndre Jordan starting, LBJ not available every game  Window is closing imo"
Perkins back then on OKC is pretty much like DeAndre Jordan starting in a playoff game this year
"This was 6 years ago, so I legitimately think some of the people commenting are too new to know the meme. For those who don't get it, the reference is to a since-deleted Chris Broussard ~~lie~~ Tweet that he ended up apologizing for during the 2015 free agency DeAndre Jordan saga that tought Marv Albert what an emoji is. You should look into it if you aren't familiar.  ""Sources: Cuban is beside himself. Driving around downtown Dallas begging (thru texts) Jordan's family for address to DeAndre's home"" — Chris Broussard (@Chris_Broussard) July 9, 2015"
Deandre Jordan is so washed
"I wouldn't say DeAndre Jordan is the outright worst Center in the NBA, there are definitely dep bench 5s worse than he is, but I would say he's the worst Center in the NBA with an actual rotation spot."
"lmao all those guys &gt;&gt;&gt; current deandre jordan  hell, drummond in philly is looking better than lakers DJ"
I honestly kinda forgot that Deandre Jordan even existed
Andre Drummond is a poor man's DeAndre Jordan.
He heard y’all were comparing him to Deandre Jordan.
"Yeah. I see what you mean now. He should have never let him go. Looking back on it, it sounds like Cuban didn’t offer him a superstar contract. However, maybe he never becomes the 2 time mvp with Dallas.  2005-2011 the teams were stacked. I am biased but I thought wade got every call in 2006. They probably had to many scores to be honest  Now for whatever, he hasn’t been able to get free agents. They saved up there cap and lost put deandre Jordan. No free agents want to go there, limited assists right now. Of course none of us would say this if KP was the New York KP."
2020s DeAndre Jordan = free lane to the rim and a shooting foul every other possession
deandre jordan is gone
We signed the wrong Deandre. Bembry and Jordan both suck.
"Lebron will always be the difference between winning losing even against the worst teams in the league. The Lakers have a hodgepoge roster of misfits and washed players. But they also have Lebron. When has he ever had a team that could win without him?  Speaking of the actual play on the floor, they play with Vogel's handicaps playing Deandre Jordan, and fighting over screens on defense and trying to recover instead of switching despite having the most switchable defense in the league when Ad and Lebron are their bigs. If they're healthy at the end of season that's how they'll be playing, and Deandre Jordan will disappear from the rotation. How good is that team?"
I wonder how long before DeAndre Jordan is just permanently benched
"If the Lakers are going to have to win the championship it's going to be by starting Ad at the 5. Getting reps with that in the regular season would be very helpful.  Playing big also means that the minutes of Nunn/THT/Ariza/Monk/Bradley are going to be limited, yet suddenly late in games/late in the season they will be thrown in and expected to fit in.  The last argument against starting big is who the Lakers are starting: Deandre Jordan. He is a worse player than Dwight Howard. At the very least they should give all the big minutes to Dwight."
It’s the team defense that’s their problem so far. Idk what Vogel is doing by playing Deandre Jordan…
DeAndre Jordan is not a professional basketball player
The Rockets and Deandre Jordan*
I love how Deandre Jordan plays no defense. Just screens and vibes.
fuck deandre jordan
Holy fuck Deandre Jordan is so bad
"fucking deandre jordan, jesus christ"
We can't start Deandre Jordan and we need to play small ball.      We've started almost every game so slow and then catch up when we go small ball... Then put the big lineup back in and lose all momentum
Would've preferred him over Deandre Jordan
"Of course those two things are related. You are more likely to find role players that shoot insane percentages (e.g above 65% TS). Shot selection obviously matters too, lob getters like DeAndre Jordan have very high percentages. But their volume is low.   How 'much' depends on other parameters. At some point someone who is very efficient on low volume is not necessarily useful as it implies they can only take easy shots. Being able to take difficult shots and make them when it's necessary is a highly desired skill so that possessions don't go to waste."
"No this is false and we don't even have to discuss subjectivity of eye test. Westbrook in 2017 almost led the league in uncontested perimeter shots among 20+ minute players and was only behind DeAndre Jordan... a center who isn't supposed to challenge perimeter shots as often. He ranks high even post 2017 in this stat and it's obvious based on the gameplay.   This is why it becomes news when Westbrook does indeed try to play defense, like in the playoffs when he said he was going to shut Rubio down and tried to guard him starting from half court. Of course he forgot to win the game tho."
"Melo, Deandre Jordan, and Westbrook are all rotation players. Will it continue to be this bad? No. Will it still be awful? Yes. Vogel cant save this team, only elevate them."
And suspend DeAndre Jordan while we're at it
Bazley or DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan
"At least Suggs gives you defence, hes not worse than a guy like Harkless or Deandre Jordan"
Bro Deandre Jordan on the Lakers in 2k rn might as well be Shaq he’s so good
"“I will bury you, ~~Tracy~~ DeAndre Jordan!”"
Nets defense will be fine now that we don't have DeAndre Jordan  Trae Young &gt; Jayson Tatum
"over the hill means old and past their prime, so not necessarily shell of themselves. Just no longer at their peak. If someone is a shell of their former self, I’d probably say they were washed up. Think DeAndre Jordan"
"It's a wonder our defense is as good as it is with 5 of our 9 man rotation being 35, 34, 34, 32, and 32 years old (Gay, Conley, Ingles, Bojan, Whiteside).   That's almost as geriatric as the Lakers' rotation. Of the 13 players who have gotten 200-ish minutes this season, their have a 33, 37, 31, 32, 37, 34, 36, 33, and 35 year old (Westbrook, Melo, Avery Bradley, Bazemore, LeBron, Ellington, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, and Rondo). In their expected 8 man lineup for playoffs, assuming they make it, I'd expect at least Westbrook (33), Melo (37), LeBron (37), Dwight (36), Ellington (34), and maybe Bradley (31) or Rondo (35).  We're not quite *that* old, but getting there."
"I am a Timberwolves fan so of course take it with a grain of salt. That’s fine. I’ve also watched just about every single game of LeBron’s career and hundreds, if not thousands, of other NBA games over the course of my life. So, again, I feel that I am pretty qualified to make that distinction. This really isn’t me about trying to get sympathy or other people to agree with me either, I just truly don’t think the Wolves are officiated like other teams. Would that call ever be made on Blake Griffin, or any other star player for that matter? Absolutely not. DeAndre Jordan nearly killed Brandon Knight and that wasn’t a foul. I can go down the list. I know you agreed that it wasn’t a foul but these types of BS calls or non calls happen to the Wolves almost every single game."
"because there’s a clear distinct way the two carry themselves. DeAndre Jordan is a big bad man, you can tell he’s one of the quiet but but dangerous type. He is a black man from the H after all. LeBron whines about not getting respect, he’s mentally soft."
There’s a difference between fighting a 7 foot 270 pound center from Houston Texas vs a 37 year old bald man that’s been pampered since high school. You think Stewart is dumb enough to fight DeAndre Jordan?
Why ain’t he swing then? He was right next to Bron? Or what about when he charges at deandre Jordan and stopped in his tracks lol. Stop acting like anything actually happened. It’s the same as all NBA “fights”.

"Jfc Ant, reminds me of when Deandre Jordan eviscerated Brandon Knight’s entire life"
"Exactly.   He didn't want to hit Bron, cause Bron is Bron (taller than Stewart, same weight, probably A LOT stronger than 20 year old Stewart.)  He also didn't want to try and go through 7' 280 lb Deandre Jordan to get to Bron because Stewart allowed himself to be restrained both times Deandre got between him and Bron.   Stewart was ACTING TOUGH.   Not enough people in this sub know what that looks like."
"Stewart's probably never fought anyone his size (Bron is actually taller and the same weight.) Stewart also pulled up twice when he ran into Deandre Jordan who is 7' 280 lbs. He was charging through his teammates and training staff until he came up against Jordan, then somehow he magically becomes restrainable by those same guys. Stewart was acting."
"Trust me, people want Stewart's fake ass display to be real so badly they make up a shitload of excuses that don't fly.   example... he was charging through tons of his own players and training staff, but when he came up against Deandre Jordan (2 times,) magically that same staff was able to hold him back. How is that possible?  It's possible because he didn't want none of Bron or Deandre Jordan who are both older, stronger, and taller than him. Stewart just wanted people to think he did to save face with his act.   Not fallin for it."
"Been sayin the same thing about Issac Stewart's Oscar worthy performance going after Bron, but not swinging when he had a chance, then backing off Deandre Jordan when he needed to get through him to fight James. Stewart made a clown of himself."
Deandre Jordan effect
It's mostly because the Nets don't have DeAndre Jordan anymore.
"Yeah thats fair, im not saying it's a rule for every De or D' player, just  that we all know DeAndre Jordan by DJ not by DAJ, which feels obvious but I guess not lol."

I love your posts but for the love of God its DJ not DAJ lol. He aint KAT or KAJ he only goes by DeAndre Jordan not a middle name.
"It always seems to me a strange genre of discussion forum comment to say that it’s not a good sign that a team won when such-and-such player played well. Imagine for example that LeBron played crappy and the lakers won on an amazing performance by DeAndre Jordan, or Avery Bradley, or anybody else. Then the response would be, “it's not a good sign that the Lakers won on a great game by DeAndre Jordan because he is obviously not going to keep that up.”  That's the nature of the game — players play better and worse on different nights. It's almost guaranteed  that, on any night, some of your players will play above their norm and other below it."
"""where's the whistle DeAndre Jordan totally just fouled me"""
Haven't watched any Lakers games this season and had to pull up the roster to see who OP was even talking about. TIL DeAndre Jordan plays for the Lakers.
Great screen by Deandre Jordan
bye bye DeAndre Jordan
"Lakers shouldn't be losing with this line up. Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Melo, Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo. That used to be a team you bring to the Olympics."
It has to be better than any lineup with DeAndre Jordan in it. Can’t stand watching him.
have you watched games? half the team dont even try on defense. Its a whole lot more than a deandre jordan and having to work around him issue
DeAndre Jordan just in case
DAJ - DeAndre Jordan. AD - Anthony Davis. AB - Avery Bradley. THT - Talen Horton-Tucker.  Why Lakers getting all the nicknitials...OP must be from ESPN.  /s
"The biggest thing was Knicks got rid of those contracts and then signed one of the Morris twins who they ended up trading for a first. But overall, the total trade compensation threads are way out of hand lol. Mavs gave up half season of Wesley Matthews/ Deandre Jordan, DSJ, an early 20’s first rounder in 2021, and TBD protected first in 2023."
The problem is AD’s insistence on playing PF and trying to recreate the 2019-20 Sixers with 2 centers and a non shooting point guard.  He needs to stop being soft and play center because playing DeAndre Jordan and Davis together will not work when your PG is Russell Westbrook
"After the whole Ben Simmons saga, I really hope his value goes so low that Morey can’t do shit but trade him for like DeAndre Jordan or Brad Wanamaker. Fuck Daryl Morey."
Mavs-Clips turning out to be quite the rivalry. And to think it all started with Mark Cuban attempting to sign DeAndre Jordan.
Avery Bradley and Deandre Jordan would like a word
Deciding who should take the last shot based on career percentages is incredibly moronic. Should Wayne Ellington be the only one to take a game winning 3 as he has the highest career 3 point percentage on the lakers. Should DeAndre Jordan be the only one to take a game winning 2 because he has the highest career 2 point percentage?
Shout out DeAndre Jordan. Stepping up on defense that quarter.
#I JUST WANT TO LET IT BE KNOWN THE KNICKS IN THAT 3rd QUARTER WAS SO BAD THEY MADE DEANDRE JORDAN LOOK SERVICEABLE
Does DeAndre Jordan know how to fucking run?
"Lmao, DeAndre Jordan dove into the paint like he was gonna do something. Hilarious"
I think DeAndre Jordan commits a defensive 3sec violation on every possession
I heard Kemba is the Deandre Jordan of the Knicks.
DeAndre Jordan is pretty solid
" Melo, THT, and Monk are “me over we” kind of guys and aren’t good defensively   Bradley, DeAndre Jordan, Ellington, and Howard aren’t good anymore  Westbrook is a team player but a very sloppy one and doesn’t care defensively   Combine all that, this adds up to being a shitty team"
Is there a reason Deandre Jordan is getting minutes in 2021?
"100%. Shit not even just 7th man. In the past month, I have seen more DeAndre Jordan ESPN articles than Bradley Beal."
Ok I'm all for firing Frank Vogel now. 20 games into the season and this dude still plays DeAndre Jordan. WTF is wrong with this dude.
DeAndre Jordan on the Lakers - ESPN probably
"By far the best take on the whole situation is this one that you alone are putting over the place, that deandre Jordan scared him shitless."
TIL that Deandre  Jordan is named Hyland.
"Around the 18-19 season there are rumors (shit like this almost never gets confirmed especially since NBA players are buddy buddy. You’d never know that Kyrie and KD hates Lebron  or how petty Steph Curry can be from their press releases) about DSJ not being happy with Luka’s shot attempts.   Deandre Jordan was apart of the camp that backed him up and boom both traded by the deadline   The other trades I pin more on Mark Cuban being a closet racist and wanting Luka to be Larry Bird , but the Rick Carlisle firing doesn’t look good"
Buddy hield for westbrook and deandre jordan
Stewart got pissed because his fake tough guy routine got exposed on national TV. Chicken Stew is 6'8 250 lbs and  has fragile ego small penor syndrome. Embiid is 4 inches taller and 50 lbs heavier and a troll. Stewart wouldn't have a chance. He wouldn't throw hands against Bron at 6'9 260lbs or Deandre Jordan at 7' 275 lbs.
"What about Dwight Howard? He's not the same athlete he once was, but he's still very athletic. More than say DeAndre Jordan, who has been an iron man throughout his career."
Exactly.   Bron is just as big and probably stronger (man-strength vs boy bulk) and Stewart stopped his bull rush TWICE when he ran into Deandre Jordan.   He looked like an out of control bitch that realized his tough guy act was exposed on national TV.   He ain't gonna do shit (again) in the future to anyone with size.
"Stewart walked away looking like a bitch.   Bloodied but had too much stewussy to throw hands at Bron, and stopped charging **twice** when he came up against Deandre Jordan."
"Reggie never enforced shit. That's why his take is shit.   The guys he mentioned were actual enforcers. Stewart is a man-baby that got pissed when he realized he wouldn't touch Bron, and was unwilling to try and get past Deandre Jordan."
More like CHICKEN STEW... running around in circles clucking.  Wouldn't throw hands at Bron. Wouldn't even try to get past Deandre Jordan (stopped twice when Deandre stood between him and Bron.)
"Exactly, Stewart's a poser.   Bron is bigger and stronger than Stewart... not being used to that he thought twice about throwing hands when they were squared up.   Then Stewart realized he might just look like a bitch all bloodied and backing off... so he tries to re-engage.   But then he runs into Deandre Jordan twice and for some reason doesn't try to get past him... hmmm? Curious no?  Did all this acting to try and not look like wimp but ended up playing himself multiple times. He should retire."
"He didn't want any part of Deandre Jordan. Yep, even Plum would be too much for him."
"Dude wanted a piece of nobody. He had his chance at Bron (a bigger man) and didn't take it. Then he charged at Bron, but stopped at Deandre Jordan (another bigger man).. Then charged again at Bron, knocked down a whole bunch of average sized guys and stopped yet again at Deandre Jordan.  Why is it that these tiny guys he could run through at will, but before he got to Bron or Deandre they somehow were able to stop him?  Easy, Stewart wanted to look tough, but he ain't. Stewart's a man baby. All those guys Reggie mentioned would have actually done something."

Lol clown Blake all you want. But he’s right. This whole narrative that this guy is now the worlds toughest guy is laughable considering he did a bunch of nothing lol. Charged Lebron three times. The third time ran half court only to magically be stopped by the presence of Deandre Jordan when no one before DJ could stop him. Funny…
"[CJ Williams](https://youtu.be/k5HAK8mAhSI) is the one Steven Adams went after.  Edit: Coincidentally, both Westbrook and DeAndre Jordan are in this video lol"
DeAndre Jordan just hits different.
explains why Vogel plays DeAndre Jordan
Did we watch the same series of events? I saw Stewart have an opportunity to get violent with LeBron right after the initial incident. Then he did his whole act of juking staff and teammates just to freeze up in front of DeAndre Jordan when he got *kinda* close to LeBron again.
"it was from one of the greatest offseason moments of all time in the NBA. DeAndre Jordan agreed to sign with the Dallas Mavericks as soon as FA opened up, and the Clippers players ended up locking him in his house and convincing him to stay with LA instead. Then Mark Cuban was trying to get in touch with DJ to try to convince him to still sign with the Mavs but couldn't get in contact with him and Broussard tweeted that copy pasta."
He's got DeAndre Jordan and Dwight how much security does one man need?
"You’re reaching bro, I’ll be the first to admit ima sorry ass Spurs fan, and Ima LeBron fan too no doubt, but ur on his dick more than u tryna say I am, secondly, Stewart gets to DeAndre Jordan and stops running full speed and allows trainers and players to catch up to him, watch the film instead of saying dumbass shit, Stewart is a basketball player not a fighter, you and I got no clue what his hands are like and assuming he can fight because he tests players that you deem sweet is even stupider cause then that’s just picking on dudes that never fight anyway, all in all your analysis looks foolish, you got clear hate for Bron and that’s cool, but assuming this dude Stewart can fight just because he runs by trainers is stupid as hell, and I gotta assume you’re too."
"Lol Lakers narrative invading in again.  Hit DeAndre Jordan while six trainers and players are holding him back for dear life?  That DEFINITELY seems remotely possible.  And yeah, we haven’t seen Stewart fight, but i’m going to go ahead and say that he fights better than a wine mom masquerading as a pro basketball player that has been coddled by everyone around him since he was like 10 years old.  How do the Lakers nuts taste tho?"
bro he did all that until deandre jordan and russ where infront of him then he promptly stopped on a dime lol
"Nobody in this comment section has seen Stewart fight bruh, if he wanted to swing he woulda swung, he dragged it out when it was over, he wasn’t gonna get to Bron and if he was really gon hit somebody he coulda snuck DeAndre Jordan, he’s more Draymond Green than Zach Randolph"
"he got within 5 feet of DeAndre Jordan and then… did nothing, he might’ve been mad enough to fight but he real he wasn’t gonna hit Lebron."
"DeAndre Jordan is a big man and LeBron enforcer, so no"
If 2016 happened again now I think voters would have put him on the first team all nba as the center over Deandre Jordan. He was legitimately a top-5 player that year.
The Nets started DeAndre Jordan over Allen for long stretches.
Jarrett Allen vs DeAndre Jordan who would you rather have on your team
Also stopped in his tracks when he got close to deandre Jordan
"Can you link the multiple Embiid pushes on DeAndre Jordan and John Collins ones? Not doubting you, just haven’t seen em."
I think I have witnessed LeBron being pushed like this more then 1000x times over the last 20 years. I haven't seen Livingston being dirty but I've seen Embiid doing the same to eather DeAndre Jordan or John Collins multiple times in single games. Why is this event with LeBron and Joel singled out so much?
"Stewart visibly backed down when he ran into Deandre Jordan on his breakaway attempt, and I think by official measurements Jokic is a bit bigger than DAJ. Not that I'm questioning how badass Stewart is, but pretty sure that even he knows going up against a dude much bigger than you is a bad idea no matter how tough you are."
"He wasn't trying to fight, he was standing his ground in between his teammate and a sprinting Stewart.  Stewart stopped before he got to Westbrook and DeAndre Jordan"
That looks like the best man defense DeAndre Jordan has played in the last few years.
"Would have been funny seeing him get past the Pistons to only be met with DeAndre Jordan, final boss"
DeAndre “Highest FG% of All Time” Jordan would like a word
&gt;I suppose you excused him pushing embiid to  There's nothing to excuse. It was a total accident. Like FFS he's a pro big. Yea you don't box someone out by sticking your face into the path of their arm. Stewart absoltuly didn't have position and was committing a loose ball foul on Bron while committing another push off into the back of DeAndre Jordan.
"Stewart:   1. Has clear opportunity to hit Lebron (too scared)   2. Once realizing enough people are there to hold him back, he charges. The ol’ “HOLD ME BACK MAN”  3. Manages to get far enough but comes face to face to deandre jordan, more scared than he was before   4. Does one last run in the tunnel to make it appear that he is “about that action”"
DeAndre Jordan squaring up like he gonna do somethin hahah
Lebron throwing dirty elbows and spending 3 minutes backpedaling while Deandre Jordan steps up to play enforcer is some real bitch shit.
You're insane. You keep repeating this and have been proven wrong multiple times lol. Stop it dude.   whose hand is touching the back deandre jordan and which hand is it? answer that and you'll see how wrong your take is
That angle has deandre Jordan perfectly blocking everything but Stewart’s face though lol. You can barely see him lifting lebrons leg in the air
That's DeAndre Jordan.
DeAndre Jordan shifting side to side has me crying 😂 I know DJ was fearing for his life in that moment
"A week ago, after our win against the Spurs I wrote that this team ain't winning shit and was downvoted to oblivion. (shoutout /u/ihateeuge)  **It took supernatural effort to get the win vs a rebuilding Detroit team, who shot 12% in the 4th quater, and we still end up giving 110+ points.**   But seriously, the Lakers, as they are right now, are horrible. This team simply is constructed in way that there is no possible solution to what is going on now.   Westbrook has been detrimental on both sides of the floor. No defense what so ever, doesn't box out, has no lateral quickness to switch when covering, doesn't go above screens, and simply doesn't hustle enough at any time to cover where he is short.  On offense sloppy turnovers, and all around bad shooting. Even his attacking in the paint has been underwhelming.   DeAndre Jordan shouldn't be on the floor more than 7-10 minutes per game. Nothing more to say there.   Anthony Davis has been great, but it won't be enough for this team to overcome all other deficiencies. LeBron James has been more injured than playing, and even when playing you could see him simply not engaged enough on defense to work. Elington, Howard, Carmelo, Monk - none of them solve what we lost this season. Solid lengthy defenders that could cover a lot of ground and chase around switches all night long. No matter what your offense is, if you can't at least provide some kind of hustle in trying to disrupt opponents schemes, you literally have to shoot perfectly all night long to negate your (non)existence in defence. **In other words - THIS TEAM CAN'T BUY A STOP!**   I seriously don't blame Vogel for this. He has proven his system can work when given personnel that suit his ideology of basketball. But because Pelinka is a bitch hiding behind his atroucious management decision this offseason, and Jeannie all supporting this, he'll be the first victim to fall in a line of this sad, miserable season that will, at best, finish with a 1st round exit. That is, if we secure playoffs."
FUCK DEANDRE JORDAN
"I don’t think DeAndre Jordan should be starting, but Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot definitely shouldn’t be starting. He probably shouldn’t even get pt."
I LOVE DEANDRE JORDAN
Deandre Jordan saved Rui’s life lmao
FUCK DeAndre Jordan   All my homies HATE DeAndre Jordan
FUCK DEANDRE JORDAN
can i get a FUCK DEANDRE JORDAN
"Both of those teams have two hall of famers. CP3, Harden and Blake. People definitely thought they were going to win championships. Same as the Clippers last year, just because they didn't doesn't mean they weren't contenders. They just underperformed.   They also had reasonable role players in Gordon, Tucker and Capela and DeAndre Jordan and Reddick. They definitely didn't do as well as they should've."
"Chris Paul can lead an offense, he can’t lead a locker room. there’s a reason so many of his former teammates think he’s an asshole. specifically his clippers teammates. remember when DeAndre Jordan agreed to join the mavs and then backed out and decided to stay in LA? dude was trying to get away from playing with CP3 because of how he would treat him."
DeAndre Jordan dunk on Brandon Knight  That's it
"2017 they still had Kristaps, Noah (of course he became a tire fire but at the time there was still some hope he could be at least solid), Frank Ntilikina (who was just drafted with high hopes)   2018 Knicks had DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Smith Jr. (thought to be a future star), Frank Ntilikina (who still had more hope back then) and Mitchell Robinson   76ers:  2013: ROY MCW, Nerlens Noel (granted he was hurt but still had that hope)  2014: Noel, Robert Covington, Joel Embiid (missed year but still carried massive hope)   2015: Noel, Covington, Embiid (still hurt), Jalil Okafor (was still an all rookie guy with upside at time)  2016: Covington, Embiid, Saric (decently regarded draft and stash guy playing his first year), Simmons (hurt the whole year but still was a hopeful impact guy)   Nets 10 years ago had Brook Lopez"
Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan used to get it a lot.
"DeAndre Jordan, and what Gobert did offensively the last two seasons was better than any DJ year."
Whenever someone says KAJ I think Karl Anthoy Jowns and whenever I see DJJ  I either think Deandre Jordan Junior or Dennis (J)Smith Junior.
Nets  Stars win games and there isn't a better pair of stars in the east than Durant and Irving. I can also easily see them making a trade for another second tier player giving them another play maker and scorer. #1 thing that need to do is stop play Deandre Jordan so much I think.
"I don't know he's clearly more talented than your traditionnal Deandre Jordan rim runner type offensively, but he isn't good enough to really be a featured offensive player either unless it's against a really small team, maybe his ceiling is a better Valanciunas on offense ? Defensively he could be way way way better than JV. So he could be a solid 3/4 times all star if he ever stop settling so much"
"Yeah everyone always talks about how 'who can beat a lineup of Curry, Harden, LeBron, KD, AD, Draymond, Klay, Dame, etc etc etc etc. But since when do all those players actually choose to opt in?   The last us Olympic team was Kyrie/Lowry, Klay/Jimmy/DeMar, KD/PG/Melo, Harrison Barnes/Draymond, Boogie/DAJ. Which obviously still won gold and most years would also still win gold, but I wouldn't exactly call currently Melo, Harrison Barnes, DeAndre Jordan or Kyle and DeMar the top of the top talent. Great players, especially at the time, but not exactly the best of the best.   It gets even worse when you look at the last world cup roster  Kemba/Smart/Derrick White  Mitchell/Joe Harris  Middleton/Jaylen  Tatum/Barnes  BroLo/Turner/Plumlee  I know American players tend to care more about the Olympics than the world cup, but like................"
Today I was arguing with someone on the comments of an Instagram post. He claimed DeAndre Jordan is better than Mikal Bridges and I disagreed. Then he said DeAndre is also a better defender than Bridges and I stopped entertaining that argument because... really dude?
"Deandre Jordan can not be letting half healthy Clint "" I aint played basketball in a calendar year"" Capela put moves on him"
"NGL, Deandre Jordan looks gassed out there and the game just started."
deandre jordan is so lazy
"if not finals at least conference finals.   i think their teams offense is gonna be beautiful and if they can be average on defense theyre golden, they need to trade for some sort of big behind deandre jordan though"
hope tristan thompson owns the boards against deandre jordan
"Basketball reference has a cool [HoF Prob](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html) stat that tracks their understanding of the player's chances to be in the HoF based on accolades, stats, and a few random other factors (for some reason, height?) that I've dug into pretty deep. I can get into it a little if you're interested, but it's a little overly conservative and can't really take coaching experience or cultural impact into account, so it really breaks for some obvious ones (Don Nelson and Drazen Petrovic both show as no chance essentially)  Anyhow, they have Rose at a 12% chance, just behind Al Horford and just ahead of Bernard King (who is in the Hall). Cousins is all the way down at a 1.5% chance, just behind Larry Siegfried and ahead of Scott Wedman. Per this specific measurement, Drummond actually already has a better chance at the HoF than Boogie - as do DeAndre Jordan, Paul Millsap, IT, etc.  For what it may be worth, per this stat, best player not to make the HOF yet despite eligibility is Bosh, who has a 99.51% chance, but was only eligible one year. Second place is Larry Foust, a star C from the 50s, with a 94.2% chance, an third is Chauncey Billups, with an 84.4% chance."
Harrell would put up 30/20 a night playing against the corpse of DeAndre Jordan.
"He hasn't looked quite right since deandre jordan kneed him the head. He'll get back to normal, his passing has still been pretty good"
deandre jordan cosplay
"It feels like the 9/10 doesn't happen that much anymore.  Back before the issues started, he was streaky, but he would sometimes go stretches of 10 or 15 makes in a row.  I remember him going 17/17 in a game before.  Honestly, has gotten worse the more he works on it, has got to get over mental side of it.  Maybe start talking a lot like DeAndre Jordan."
Agreed. Deandre jordan in no universe should have an all nba first team on his resume.
"Forgot about Joe Harris, but I still like the construction of the 76ers team better assuming they give up Simmons, Maxey, and Thybulle plus picks for Harden. The Nets team has a better offense, but are way worse defensively. As for Dwight, I'd take him over both Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan. He played good minutes for the Lakers during the playoffs. DeAndre Jordan is pretty washed up imo and only reason why he's still on the team is because he's friend with Kyrie and KD. Jeff Green is pretty limited as a player. Beyond that the rest of the team is pretty thin especially with Dinwiddie out."
Deandre Jordan
"You mention Seth, Danny Green, Milton and Dwight as part of the Sixers core but for the Nets Joe Harris is a G leaguer?? And is Dwight even better than Jeff Green or DeAndre Jordan at this point?"
"It’s more efficient than the Warriors. Joe Harris is shooting 50% from 3 and is about to get even more open. Kyrie typically shoots over 40%. And then you have James fucking Harden. DeAndre Jordan, if he decides to start being good again was one of the most efficient scorers for years."
"LeBron isn't better. Hasn't been for a long time. LeBron has had to fire coaches and trade teammates and load management to get to where he is. KD didn't get anyone fired, and other than asking the Nets to sign DeAndre Jordan, he didn't require anything of them when he signed here. He plays as many minutes as he's allowed and even though he's just coming back from two leg surgeries he played in both games of a back to back this week.  I'll give you that he was probably involved in getting Harden to come here, but to a much lesser extent than LeBron LeTampering with Anthony Davis, whose agent is LeBron's childhood best friend.  If it wasn't for Kyrie Irving's bucket in Cleveland and Klay and KD getting injured during the finals, KD would have as many/more rings than LeBron."
Yeah Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan will defitenly figure out Giannis in the playoffs..
Im gonna miss watching Jarrett Allen in Brookyln.  Deandre Jordan is like a depressing husk of his former self.
"Their worst matchups in my opinion are the Lakers, Bucks, Clippers and Sixers (in that order) and theres a world where they have to face 3 of these teams in one playoff run. Their biggest problem, at least in my opinion, is rim protection so its important to look at the teams that will feast at the rim.  The Lakers will absolutely be able to feast against the Nets at the rim and it gets even worse when you think about the minutes where they will have to have a backup center in the game going up against Monrezl Harrell. Can you really trust a guy like Claxton against not only Harrell but against the other players coming off the bench for the Lakers. Not to mention that Lebron/AD will be playing most of the game and theres nobody on the team that can defend AD at all. Tough matchup for the Nets and I feel that they would have a better time in next years playoffs if its against the Nets.  On the Bucks it is entirely possible that Jrue, Giannis, and Khris work together to contain James or Kyrie and negate some of the guard offense that Brooklyn will be reliant on, but even if they don't there isn't anyone on the team who can stop Giannis. They're going to have to build an even tighter wall than we've ever seen and this will allow Middleton and Holiday to put up big numbers. This is a series where Deandre Jordan could foul out easily in every single game and leave the Nets scrambling for extra paint defense. Honestly an incredibly tough matchup, but one where I can see the Nets coming out on top because of their absolutely insane offensive potential.  The Clippers have as ideal of a lineup as you can ask for against a team with an elite offensive PG, SG, and forward. Beverley, PG, and Kawhi on Kyrie, Harden, and Durant is about as good as you're going to find in the league and with a guy like Serge Ibaka backing them up that's going to at least present a bigger challenge for the Nets than 95% of teams can present. The issue with the Clippers is honestly the same with the Nets. Both teams are going to be reliant on guys who disappear in the playoffs, guys who are prone to injury and on a team with guys who understand the heaps of pressure being put on them. The Clippers and Lakers being the two western favorites is pretty much the least ideal situation Brooklyn could ask for.  The 76ers are basically the anti-Nets. They're super defensive and play above the rim. Theres a world where Simmons is on KD, and then you figure the rest out from there, with Embiid locking up the paint. Who can guard Embiid on this team? This is a series where Dwight Howard can actually put up 10 pts, 10 rebs off the bench and Shake can average 13-16 ppg off the bench. I would bet the house on the Nets winning this series but there is a world where we see the Sixers looking completely unstoppable at the rim.  I would bet on the Nets getting to the finals and losing, then looking better next year after getting more front court depth."
"Stopped by Marc Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Bam Adabayo, and Jae Crowder vs stopped by Jeff Green and Deandre Jordan"
Deandre Jordan will be their downfall. He’s going to be pick and rolled to death one way or another.   Not sure who in the East is capable enough of running that consistent Pick and Roll though.
Y’all sleeping on the rest of the east. Deandre Jordan will be eaten alive if they don’t get someone better
If you only got your basketball knowledge from reddit you'd think Giannis was DeAndre Jordan
Bball Paul getting it out da mud vs DeAndre Jordan
"I’m gonna go off the beat and say Boston. Smart, Brown, and Tatum are as good of a combo you can get to guard the 3 Brooklyn stars.   Boston doesn’t have the center depth to matchup against Philly or even MIL but against Deandre Jordan? They would still likely lose but not as bad as some would think"
"You put Giannis up against elite defenders like Bam, Gasol, Kawhi, and Crowder and he crumbles. That’s a far cry from washed Deandre Jordan and Jeff Green"
I think Horford works for DeAndre Jordan and Dinwiddie.  I don’t know how they’d attach a pick though
Don't they have DeAndre Jordan? He seems pretty sane.  I mean prone to stockholme syndrome sure...
"Harden,Kyrie and KD formed a super team with DeAndre Jordan in reality.."
Blake Griffin Deandre Jordan Nick Young Jeremy Lin  All funny or have cool personalities.
Don’t worry  nets have deandre jordan he gonna block 50 shots every-night.
"They traded all the glue guys. It’s just Harris left from the original team. Congratulations, Nets; you built up a “culture” just to throw it and your future away to win immediately, and you did it by building a team where the only big man is the dessicated husk of DeAndre Jordan and a bunch of dudes whose idea of “defense” is to try to score 130 points a game. And I’m sorry, but I don’t think they can win a title doing that, which is a problem because they have to win *now* or else this might be the worst trade of all time, and they just recovered from a different awful trade."
Jakob poetls free throws gave me peak DeAndre Jordan flashbacks lmao
"&gt; Centers are notorious for peaking their rookie years because the position is so easy  14 pts, 8 reb, 1 ast - Anthony Davis' ""peak"" rookie season.   10 pts, 7 reb, 2 ast - Nikola Jokic's ""peak"" rookie season.   7 pts, 6 reb, 2 ast - Bam Adebayo  2 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Rudy Gobert  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 ast - Nikola Vucevic  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Serge Ibaka  4 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Deandre Jordan  3 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Clint Capela  2 pts, 1 reb - Thomas Bryant  3 pts, 4 reb, 1 blk - Steven Adams"
DeAndre Jordan or Jeff Green when we go small. Give our rookie Reggie Perry some run. Hopefully sign Dedmon.  DeAndre's only skill nowadays is setting monster screens and tapping out o-rebounds haha
Wait: Kevin Durant is Batman James Harden is Robin should not Kyrie Irving be Batgirl and Deandre Jordan Alfred.
The Nets have a lot of star power but their defence is not gonna be very good at all. DeAndre Jordan is their only true center option and a Harden/Irving back court is very difficult to cover for since they aren’t a particularly switchable team.  I don’t think they’re the favourites right now but I could be wrong. They could average 130 points per-100 possessions and just nuke everybody on offence.
I think Philadelphia can beat Brooklyn as-is. They won't be the favorites but it's not like it can't happen if Embiid goes beast mode on *DeAndre Jordan*.
"That's true in a vacuum but I look at it like this. Jarrett Allen is a nice player, and they were undoubtedly better with him on the floor than DeAndre Jordan. But both of them play the most replaceable position in the game. And when you think about the amount of effort other teams will have to put in to defend this team, their defense doesn't matter. There are no stars in the east that can do enough to keep their teams in games against this."
Would Deandre Jordan+Dinwiddie not be a close match? BKN upgrades greatly at center position and Dinwiddie is out for the year and will most likely regress next year. If BKN is in win now mode then trading for an elite rebounder is their best bet
Under help clearly. Leave Harden wide open and double team Deandre Jordan to fuck with them psychologically.
"The importance really here is that you need to separate the two sides of the ball to contextualize the difficulties.  On offense, to see the game speed of plays developing at a NBA level as a guard is just as difficult as understanding the defensive rotation/switches in terms of game speed on the defensive end for a big man.  While inversely, on defense, for guards, perimeter switching is relatively easy especially with most teams relying on help D. While on offense, your traditionally high talent/physical specimen big men is very easy to score just on dunks during PNR where little to no thinking is involved similar to that of a Deandre Jordan role."
"Joe Johnson, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Jamal Crawford, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul George, Rajon Rondo, Joakim Noah, Kyle Lowry, Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Derrick Rose, Draymond Green"
"Their depth isn’t that bad though.  Kyrie/Harden/KD/Green/Jordan is an outstanding starting 5.  Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan are weaker starters, but decent vet role players, and the big 3 is insane.  Joe Harris is a good 6th man.  And then other guys like Shamet, TLC, Bruce Brown, etc. are decent bench players.  Also, I’m sure they get the odd buyout ring chaser as the season goes on.  Off-court stuff is a big risk.  Kyrie is a complete wildcard, and KD and Harden are both primadonnas.  But if they can keep the locker room functional, and stay healthy, I think they’re strong championship contenders this year, and even stronger next year, with an offseason to stock up on ring chasers."
Deandre Jordan guarding Giannis will go well.. How long until Kyrie has a fit that he’s now a 3rd string
Former All-NBA First Teamer DeAndre Jordan
Lol you’re the reigning champs arguing with a dude who hasn’t even seen his team play (other than knowing DeAndre Jordan has to start at center). You reek of being worried. It’s okay I would be too if I was an entitled Lakers fan. We’ve got a lot more fire power and you’ve got an aging star who’s stats are declining. I get it. You’ll be okay though even if the Lakers lose.
Good luck guarding Giannis and AD with Deandre Jordan and Jeff Green being your 5th best player
"I wouldn't call the Nets' 3-8 ""really fucking good."" I'm trying to figure out who their closing 5 is. Can you play Kyrie, Joe Harris, Harden, and Durant together? DeAndre Jordan at the 5? Or are you playing Durant at the 5, and then who else?   It would be a lot easier to figure out this Big Three if one of them were a true big man."
"Bro yesterday I saw someone call DeAndre Jordan DAJ, AND LIST OUT THE ENTIRE REST OF THE NETS ROSTER BY NAME IN THE SAME SENTENCE HOLY SHIT IT TRIGGERED ME"
"Agreed! I see no reason the nets shouldn't do this.   Obviously KD and Harden are going to be amazing together. The fit will be reminiscent of KD + Steph.   That said, the defense is suspect as shit. Nets really going all in on offense.   Success: TBD. I suppose it depends on what Kyrie does next, too.   If it's just KD + Harden + Deandre jordan and whoever else is left, I don't see them getting to the finals this year."
Joe Harris is Nightwing. Deandre Jordan is Azrael. TLC is Batwing. Spencer Dinwiddie is Batgirl. And Steve Nash is Batwoman.
They should just have DeAndre Jordan sitting at the baseline in order to catch KD whenever he falls down
"trust me, i hate deandre jordan as much as the next guy. he plays lazy. he stands like a statue. ive bitched about him nonstop. and as for your question i legitimately don’t know yet, ill have to see harden play with this squad. i give us a better chance then most people think. casual fans have been saying that we “traded all our depth”, and i can’t even get mad because unless you’re a nets fan you probably don’t know how serviceable/deep our bench really is right now. most of the guys proved themselves during the bubble games, and haven’t played much at all this year. but people will realize.   note: when i say “casual fans say that we traded all our depth” im not referring to your comment nor am i calling u a “casual”, im talking about all the shit ive seen on social media the last 24 hours by actual nephews. you posed a good question"
They’re sending over multiple time all-nba apointee DeAndre Jordan for him straight up
deandre jordan about to get his backside blown out
"Serious question, do you think the Nets take it all this year without a real big? Lebron and AD are pretty versatile offensive weapons at this point with a team full of shooters and interior presence. The Nets no doubt have the deadliest Big 3 if one of them decides to finally clock in, but I have trouble seeing Deandre Jordan pose a defensive threat in the paint in a seven game series."
2016 was a dark time for centers if DeAndre Jordan made an All NBA First team in 2016
"I don’t think Brooklyn gets out of the East playing DeAndre Jordan at Center against the Bucks, Sixers, or Heat. If anyone needs to upgrade their Center situation, it’s the Nets. I don’t even see who on the Nets is guarding Lebron/AD, they’re pretty much all offense no defense."
"I don't even think their bench is that bad honestly except at the 5 spot.  PG: Kyrie / Bruce Brown / Chris Chiozza   SG: Harden / Shamet / Tyler Johnson   SF: Harris / TLC  PF: Durant / Jeff Green   C: DeAndre Jordan / Nic Claxton  With Kyrie being out, they have a bit of backcourt flexibility which is nice. Their center depth is atrocious though. Get Whiteside for a second rounder or something."
"I love Harris, he was one of my favorite young players when he was in Cleveland and I am had he is doing well but he has never been elite on defense. Kyrie had the benefit of having good help defenders that he could push players towards. Imagine him trying to guard shroder. He would get a layup every play against Kyrie with only Deandre Jordan to help at the rim"
"&gt; Ideally, I'd have liked to dump Kyrie for some scrubs to get depth and roll with KD and Harden  This would've been ideal, but after what Kyrie's been pulling recently just missing games to attend parties and zoom calls, I doubt the teams involved wanted him. If he comes back and balls out, they'll have to make a judgment call on whether they're willing to risk another short or long-term personal absence or consistency vs. trading him for depth and a center to replace Allen because DeAndre Jordan is pretty bad."
"This is the last year of Drummond's contract that he signed 2016, he is an expiring contract.   Cavs have little reason to buy him out if they believe they can get some assets in return for him, failing that they would just let him walk in free agency and get the $28m in cap space back.   As another guy mentioned, Harris + DJ is the only trade deal that works salary-wise. But heres the catch, DJ is Kyrie &amp; KD's guy who they took paycuts to get on the team.   I wouldn't think twice about yeet-ing DeAndre Jordan off the team in 2K MyLeague, but are the Nets willing to risk making their superstars unhappy by trading away the guy they took a paycut for?"
"Obviously worth it for getting harden, but losing jarrett allen is a huge loss. A washed up Deandre Jordan is going to have to play big minutes and AD will be an absolute nightmare for them. They also traded away some depth while the Lakers are swimming in it"
I would actually bet money on this but I'll wait to even see if they're a viable contender first. There's no way they're beating the Lakers in a 7 game series. AD alone would average 40 a game being guarded by old man Deandre Jordan and Jeff Green. Hell I think the Clippers would beat them too.
"Their future was a gamble,  by the time any of those picks materialize Joe Harris will be in his 30s, Deandre Jordan will be retired, KD will be 35"
"Defense wins championships. Unless the Nets make more moves to improve their defense, even if they get to the Finals, if the Lakers are locked in on defense I'm not sure the Nets can handle that type of suffocating defense. Lakers have AD, Nets lost Allen and for now only have a washed DeAndre Jordan. And the Lakers have improved on offense compared to last year as well."
&gt;Deandre Jordan is perfectly fine to soak up minutes  So the entire premise of your argument is completely irrelevant and wrong when you say Embiid is going to get schemed out considering KD will only play small ball 5 in small spurts lmao. Embiid is going to carves the defense up whether its DAJ or KD on him. The fact that you think he’ll be a non factor once KD plays small ball 5 is weird behavior.
"The Nets don’t win this trade if they don’t win a title.  And they’re not beating teams with elite centers with DeAndre Jordan as their only real one. And also trading their entire bench *and* mortgaging their future doesn’t fix their biggest problem, because Jim Harden *does not play defense.*"
"Wait and see what happens. KD doesn't have to play every minute as a small ball 5. I don't know why you think that I said he would lol.   Deandre Jordan is perfectly fine to soak up minutes throughout a game as a big man for them. He doesn't have to be great. Just eat some minutes and not be absolute fucking garbage.   And yea, I've watched plenty of playoff basketball. You are about to watch a team with two of the greatest offensive players of all time and 3 players who are basically unstoppable  when they are on.   To act like Embiid the turnover machine is going pose some huge threat to this team in the playoffs is laughable. Going to be funny watching embiid score his 28 points on 10/20 shooting and clanking random 3s off the backboard and commiting 5 turnovers doing it. I don't trust embiid against Boston or the Bucks in a 7 game series at this point. I definitely would not pick him to beat a team with 2 of the best 5 players in the league."
"You're just gonna disrespect DeAndre ""technically a starting center"" Jordan like that?"
It worked for teams with Kawhi and Gasol and Siakam and Butler and Iggy and Bam. It’s not going to work for Joe Harris and Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan
"That's my point though, you need nothing but rebounding and some interior defense. Granted he is not supplying a *ton* of defense, but he's not DeAndre Jordan. If he was in Brooklyn and posted up twice a game it would be two times a game too many"
is Deandre Jordan ready for 30 NBA minutes at center?
"Yeah man AD is really scared of Deandre Jordan trying to defend him, kyrie gonna be in a zoom call during the playoffs for all we know"
"They could get away with a bad bench by staggering the minutes of the big 3, the biggest miss however is Jarrett Allen seeing as DeAndre Jordan is washed af.   Defense &amp; rim-protection especially is gonna be a problem unless DJ magically finds the fountain of youth somewhere"
"This Nets team will have Kyrie, Harden , Durant , and possibly Deandre Jordan in their staring lineup. They about to drop 150 on teams and give up 145."
"Guard defense doesn’t matter much when you have a elite backline. The Nets have Deandre Jordan and Jeff Green....who tf is guarding the paint for them?  KD is then going to have to be your main help defender at the rim, which means whatever wing he’s guarding is going to be open very often. And since they don’t have other elite wing defenders he basically will be guarding the opposing team’s best wing lol. This is going to end up a swiss cheese defense - they’re going to struggle guarding dribble penetration and won’t have anyone at the rim as backup."
So Nets can pick Kuzma as a defender but Lakers can't pick Deandre Jordan?
Lebron/AD taking turns cooking the corpse of Deandre Jordan
"If he's healthy, Embiid will have a feast playing against DeAndre Jordan for 38 minutes lol"
Lebron and Davis gonna have a field day vs that nets team with deandre jordan at center 😂 if they even make the finals. This team rather implodes than winning anything.
Giannis vs the Nets is going to be a layup line. Good luck building a wall with geriatric deandre jordan
As of today:        - Kyrie is still AWOL         - They have 0 defense or any elite defensive player             - Their center is DeAndre Jordan with a 2 inch vertical
AD horny thinking about that DeAndre Jordan/KD front court
"Ad is going to feast on DeAndre Jordan, and I don’t think KD is going to do much to stop him either."
dude deandre jordan sucks
The Warriors didn’t have glaring holes in their defense and literally no true big man depth/ no true big men at all besides an aging Deandre Jordan
Who’s hated more KD by nba fans or DeAndre Jordan by Nets fans
"I really don't see this working out for the Nets.   Obviously it could go either way, but the team chemistry is definitely not going to be very high, as like many people have said, there's only one ball; KD can live with that, but I can see Kyrie and Harden clashing over that. I know Harden wanted to move more offball and a lot of that was coaching, but I'm not sure he even knows how to play off ball anymore, and he has the same coach (albeit not as head coach). I don't think Steve Nash will be able to handle that as a brand new head coach.   Even if this team doesn't implode, they still have three gaping problems. Firstly, their defense will not be good. There's just no getting around that; it won't be horrible, but I digress. That leads into maybe they're worst issue: who on this team is about to guard centers? KD is not good enough to guard Giannis, and they can't pack the paint like Toronto dead bc they don't have the large defenders for it. DeAndre Jordan is not guarding any single elite center, and don't even get me started on AD. Lastly, their bench was already bad, but now they just lost Levert, who was basically their only bench player. I'd assume theyll have Spencer come off the bench when he comes back and that'll be good for them, but they have nothing else.   They'll at least make it to the Conference finals, but I would favor the Bucks over them bc of their utter lack of interior defense, as well as the Bucks being a fantastic defensive team. I also cannot see them beating the Lakers in the Finals."
"Easy, Dinwiddie and Deandre Jordan for Horford."
then send Deandre Jordan back to the clippers for ibaka
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
This. The Brooklyn Fro died for DeAndre Jordan?
"Its hard to see Harden and Kyrie as a good couple, like steph and klay. The nets now have 3 players who are ball dominant and only one center in deandre jordan"
"Give me the bucks +700. The Nets do not have an answer for Giannis. I don’t like doing individual matchups as a way of evaluating matchups but literally who will build the wall? Durant, Green, and DeAndre Jordan? Lmfao"
"The nets also had a better team surrounding kg and pierce at the time though. Now they’ve got their big 3 (who definitely have at least some degree of fit concerns) and then joe Harris, deandre Jordan, and terrible depth with no cap space or draft picks."
DeAndre Jordan has as much a chance of a career revival as Blake Griffin does.
they already have one washed center in deandre jordan they dont need another
Who is going to play in the post for this team?? They're rolling with...  * the Ghost of DeAndre Jordan * Reggie Perry * Nic Claxton  NOT GREAT
The decaying body of DeAndre Jordan of course!
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
DeAndre Jordan for Serge Ibaka. Spencer Dinwiddie and Kyrie Irving for Wendall Carter? Kristaps Porzingis. Jarret Allen.  I think WSC is Wendall Carter. None of this shit is realistic.
There are a lot of people on this sub who legitimately believe Deandre Jordan is a better C than Daniel Theis
Brook Lopez is about three months older than DeAndre Jordan
Deandre Jordan was mic'd up last game and even he was calling Harden the beard.
"Look at DeAndre Jordan from lob-city era.....he's declined since then, which is expected....but he didn't develop any extra skill sets at all, and it shows."
We just beat the Lakers with a sorry ass G-League squad /s  The way I see it is two things.   Will DeAndre Jordan be able to hold his own against the premiere bigs in the league?   And how will the Nets integrate Kyrie Irving back? There is only one ball and one of those 3 will have to take a step back... the last two games it was good to see Harden facilitate and distribute the ball. His assist numbers are going through the roof this season.   Your thoughts?
Exactly they should be using Giannis threat as a roller way more. In the last 6 or so minutes of the MIL/BRK game there was alot of giannis and Middleton pick n roll. Deandre Jordan let Middleton get 2-3 wide open mid-range shots because if he stepped up Giannis could slip past and score.
"A&amp;M had Khris Middleton, Deandre Jordan, and Robert Johnson, but Acie stood out. He was so clutch in college, he made a ton of big shots in his career, especially his senior year."
"No, it was because DeAndre Jordan is a shell of the player he used to be and his most important contribution to the Nets at this moment is being tight with KD."
DeAndre Jordan best i can think of lol
"DeAndre Jordan is their Center, they are NOT getting far"
"Not sure where that comes from, but Deandre Jordan looked like a stopper yesterday. Contesting shots, boxing out, rebounding... And then you have a taller than average PG, SG, PF and a lethal shooter. They DO need a backup for Deandre, but other than that they will be fine."
Is he deandre Jordan bad or just bad bad
Agreed. And it’s not like Deandre Jordan is a chump. Embiid might feast but I don’t think it’s a huge issue
"He deserved better, lost his starting job to the human husk that is Deandre Jordan :(  Take care of him Cleveland"
"If I'm the Nets I'd trade Kyrie for more complementary pieces to stick around KD and Harden. Nets could use an upgrade from Deandre Jordan and another shooter wouldn't be a bad idea either.  Not sure a good fit in terms of destination team though. Maybe something like JJ Reddick and Steven Adams for Kyrie?  Even then, idk."
"Shoulda been playing defense instead of fuckin around, got his ass dunked on by old-ass DeAndre Jordan"
"Deandre Jordan has been embarrassing, what are you talking about?"
&gt; Deandre Jordan looked like an Allstar last night with kd and harden  ??  Horrible defense. He gave up what felt like a dozen wide open free throw line jumpers to Giannis/Middleton because he doesn't step up and just stays at the rim.
Bruh what? Deandre Jordan looked like an Allstar last night with kd and harden... Theyre good  Kyrie is just going to raise the role players more
&gt; The much harder to contain for defenses thing is such a misconception. Giannis is such a force like Shaq he has to be barricaded at the rim. Of his team loses it's not because of him.  The fact that DeAndre Jordan is able to straight up not defend him on the perimeter is 100% a hinderance to his team.  Suggesting otherwise is flat out wrong.
Yep I remember Dudley selling the Nets to DeAndre Jordan even when Dudz wasn’t on the roster. Those little things matter (and of course location)
Past prime Deandre Jordan. That's fair tho
"also anything that makes the other team give a shit about deandre Jordan is a big boost for his minutes, honestly."
A lot of those lobs by Harden to Deandre Jordan looked pretty bad.
A prime Hakeem against DeAndre Jordan. My body is ready for such gore violence.
Idk why but dangelo lunging at the ball like that gave me shades of cp3 yelling at deandre Jordan to shoot the ball lol
that's weird because i thought deandre jordan WAS jae crowded until they said his name
"Meanwhile Webber's audio is clearly clipping, they mic'd up Deandre Jordan except they replay his audio at about 300% so its clipping and making my ears bleed, and there's no on-court audio, then they fix it by 3rd quarter except now you can't really hear the commentary because the on-court is now too loud, and Marv clearly cannot keep up with the game still.  It was the only stream available on League Pass involving the most hyped team right now, so I imagine quite a number of people have a low impression about TNT and the NBA as a product.  Amazing."
"That’s fair. Like I said before though, for me I meant it as more realistic in comparison to a Brooklyn situation. When I look at the Nets, the only other real option I see there is DeAndre Jordan. So when you compare that to the others y’all have, there’s more to work with having him on the Cavs. I don’t think many people see McGee as a legit option going forward right now,  but there are more pieces, ya know?  I won’t pretend to know what Masai and Bobby have up their sleeves, cuz those men are operating at a level way past my knowledge, lol. But the Raps organization has been fairly clear about needing a better C situation with Baynes and Len not working out that great. Boucher has been stepping up like crazy, but he can’t play all 48. Plus, his lankiness can make things difficult during certain matchups. With all that cap space hanging around for next year, I wouldn’t be surprised to see them pulling some weird, basketball magician shit, haha. Who knows though!"
"Because none of those guys play elite defense, and they're running Deandre Jordan at the 5. They're *really* good, they're probably championship-caliber if things keep going like the last few games, but they're not the 2017 Warriors by a long shot."
Any other superstar worth his salt would have taken the useless DeAndre Jordan guarding them to the nether realm. From Jokic to Steph all of em would have cooked Jordan in the clutch. Imagine being guarded by the worst player as a superstar and still not taking advantage.
"Dope video, more people need to understand how skilled Shaq was. Way too many try to depict him as a Deandre Jordan dunking type of guy."
"How about Deandre Jordan, 12 and 12 with 2 blocks and 100% from the field.  I feel like even if he's looked washed in the regular season so far, he will turn it up and play his role well in the playoffs.  He may not be the lob city Jordan anymore but he doesn't have to be. And against teams that are small they can just run KD-Green which still offers rim protection."
And Deandre Jordan is about to be the best
At this point he is just waiting for it to be over. I don't really know why he is playing so many minutes.   He looks like he should be taking on the same role as DeAndre Jordan.
I might have hallucinated this but I swear he called DeAndre Jordan Jae Crowder.
But I don’t know a lot of young players that bloomed with the clippers during Doc’s years. Deandre Jordan and Blake are all that come to mind at the moment.
oubre is awful lmao he's worse than deandre jordan
"Bruh Harden deadass left a downtown Houston strip club, flew over to Brooklyn and hopped into a uniform and dropped a 32/12/14 game in his debut. Then has his first practice yesterday with his new team and drops 34/12/6 on the reigning 2x MVPs team.   Dudes had 1 practice with his new team and is already balling tf out. Not to mention they are missing Kyrie, lack depth, have some roster spots open, are missing Dinwiddie (full season), and have the corpse of DeAndre Jordan at Center for 25 min a night..."
"Yeah your defense is really good, I'm glad we played you tonight! This showed to Brooklyn players they can actually play D, DeAndre Jordan was actually good! We improved throughout the game."
"I agree actually. But right now that might be the easiest role to fill with a vet since you can't get much worse than DeAndre Jordan. Hell, half the centers in the G-League are probably better at this point, so the Nets can feel free to experiment, especially now that they have an extra two-way."
DeAndre Jordan is the sole reason they’re not seen as a superteam. Mostly not even kidding.
Nets without Kyrie and will sign any other center in the NBA which would be an upgrade over the corpse of DeAndre Jordan.
"""Fuck r/nba""  - DeAndre Jordan"
"Landry Shamet is in his third season and has played with Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden."
When Jeff Green is a better lob target than Deandre Jordan
Question; why isn't DeAndre Jordan being called for 3 seconds? There are times where he's just staying in the key while not guarding anyone at all. He looks just camped in there from the possessions I've seen.
"how do you lose Giannis in transition?   have Deandre Jordan guard him, that's how."
Honestly why not just double Harden when he's with Shamet and Deandre Jordan
"not when he's being guarded by DeAndre Jordan, one of the few guys who's actually bigger and stronger than him"
Harden is a necromancer. He’s resurrected DeAndre Jordan for the past two games.
"Deandre Jordan is a better fit for this team than Jarrett Allen, he has much more experience"
Giannis really can't score on Deandre fuckin Jordan bruh
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
DeAndre Jordan is so much better this game than last game. The fact that he's still on the floor is a testament to that. If he can keep up this level of play they don't actually need to make many moves til the trade deadline.
Getting dunked on by DeAndre Jordan in 2020    .....
lmao deandre jordan really pretended to be washed like kyrie pretended to be awol
Deandre Jordan is the new Giannis stopper
I don't know man. It is because they are giving Giannis the Ben Simmons/Dray treatment. Bucks aren't forcing Deandre Jordan to move at all
That and the silky smooth spin move and dunk against Deandre Jordan a couple years back. Big men shouldn’t be able to move like that
"DeAndre has become lazy in the past couple of seasons. Harden will get you literal freebies 10+ times per game and DeAndre not converting is embarrassing as fuck. Harden is one of the best passers in the league but spread pick'n'roll in particular has been his bread and butter for years now. Jordan has to get a grip, he'll never get an easier time scoring than with this current squad."

DeAndre Jordan sucks ass
DeAndre Jordan can’t finish lobs anymore huh
Deandre Jordan stopped caring about playing winning basketball for so long he forgot how
Why is DeAndre Jordan so mediocre now?
Do these guys not understand that DeAndre Jordan can only jump like 2 inches now?   They're throwing these lobs that would be tough for even peak DeAndre to handle.
Deandre Jordan is so bad
Bruh when did DeAndre Jordan go from lob city to barely lifting off the ground
Deandre Jordan don’t know how to catch a lob anymore
"These lobs make me think Harden just googled ""Deandre Jordan highlights"" before he got to the Nets"
DeAndre Jordan HOF (moving) brick wall
I feel like every Deandre Jordan screen is a moving screen
You telling me Deandre “Cement Legs” Jordan isn’t cutting it?
"""Howl""  - a poem by beat poet laureate Deandre Jordan"
Is DeAndre Jordan a wolf?
"wow refs really hate Nets. Even me, in Europe, could hear how  DeAndre Jordan gets slapped on his hands but refs gives no sht about it."
"on a team with Kyrie, harden, and KD, DeAndre Jordan is still the most annoying player to me"
DeAndre Jordan should open his own restaurant and call it DeEntree Jordan's
Looking bad for Giannis that he can’t get passed a washed Deandre Jordan
Deandre Jordan guarding Giannis just look we all imagined lol
"""DeAndre Jordan just has to be-""   ""FRIDAY NIGHT IN MILWAUKEE"""
I'll never forgive Sean Marks for keeping DeAndre Jordan.
Take a shot each time:  - Harden turns the ball over  - Giannis misses a FT  - KD scratches his head  - Joe Harris misses a defensive rotation  - Deandre Jordan misses an alley oop or layup
"I'd go farther to say their ceiling is the 2019 Warriors without injuries. Deandre Jordan seems washed and Dinwiddie is injured, so the Nets are quite thin."
"Again, with which center?  Denver had Jokic and Murray, who are arguably the best PnR combination in the league. The Nets have...DeAndre Jordan?"
"&gt;He will score more than he will give up thats for sure.  I mean that's definitely the question isn't it. The Lakers always have AD or LeBron out there. I'm assuming one of KD/Kyrie/Harden will always be out there too, all 3 of whom can abuse Trez on defense.  Honestly though, IF the Nets even make it to the Finals, and IF they match up with the Lakers then, every possession where it's Trez trying to power his way over DeAndre Jordan or whichever 5 we get is gonna be feel like a win compared to what AD or LeBron could possibly do."
DeAndre Jordan
My point was your better of with Nerlens Noel than DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan is fucking ass. DeAndre Jordan also ate Mitch Robinson for dinner and made him look like a rookie again. Just because players are on my team do I overrate or underrate them.
That funny considering your team runs out the husk of DeAndre Jordan every game
It’ll be interesting what their 8-9 man rotation will end up being in the playoffs. Right now it would be  PG - James Harden SG - Kyrie Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Kevin Durant  C - DeAndre Jordan 6 - Jeff Green 7 - Bruce Brown 8 - TLC 9 - Landry Shamet  The problem at the C position is huge right now and they need someone they can rely on just as much as DeAndre Jordan. I think that’s a gap that they can fix through the buyout market decently enough. The other gap I’m not sure if they’ll be able to find a fix for is more defense.
All the top east teams have at least a couple competent wing and guard defenders; the Nets are the only team that doesn’t have a good big defender. Putting Jrue or Jaylen on Harden is a much better matchup than Giannis or Embiid on Deandre Jordan.
"If they didn't get rid of Jarrett Allen for Harden I'd say come to the nets but it's still a solid choice. KD, Harden, one of the best 3pt shooters in the league with Joe Harris. DeAndre Jordan can be a force on the interior. Itd be nice if Kyrie played a game once in a while but oh well. Or jump on the bandwagon with the Lakers. They're goings to the finals again."
"I quickly want to question their depth, but if healthy, they're fine. The wing defense will be the main question but a supporting cast around those main 3 of DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, and (when healthy) Spencer Dinwiddie isn't that bad. Fit wise it is a bit weird though"
&gt; Deandre Jordan and Joakim Noah and Damian Lillard  One of these players is not like the others
So do Deandre Jordan and Joakim Noah and Damian Lillard
So does Deandre Jordan
"Durant is going to be the 4, like he was in golden state whenever they played minutes that mattered.   Their backup 5 is Green, who imo is fine in that role. The problem is they need a starting level 5. DJ is just looking like his feet are made of cement, any screen action involving James ""I can't get over a screen if my life depends on it"" Harden and Deandre ""I can't move my feet"" Jordan is going to be really rough against good teams.   They need to find a guy that can come in and actually move his feet out on the floor and stunt / hedge for hardens inability to get over the screen quickly. Allen was perfect for this, he'll be hard to replace."
Better than Deandre Jordan at least.
"Yeah he is really struggling athletically. He has no bounce or foot speed, and you can actually see his frustration with being unable to move his body the way he wants to.  I also want to remind everyone that he averaged an efficient 27-11-5-1-1 and didn’t make all NBA in 2017. DeAndre Jordan, who forgets which hand he shoots free throws with, was named to the 3rd team."
&gt; I'd pick serious rim protector and rebounder that's more reliable than DeAndre Jordan. (ahem... Andre Drummond)  So...not Andre Drummond then?
"Your comment doesn’t make sense to me lol if I replaced the name and team and said “Deandre Jordan may not be the best player on the jazz, but he’s the best center for sure” doesn’t give you a good argument for Mitchell tbh"
"I'd pick serious rim protector and rebounder that's more reliable than DeAndre Jordan. (ahem... Andre Drummond)  Joe Harris is great, and is thriving over in Brooklyn with those guys. But all three of them can shoot. Joe Harris is just another shooter. They need some interior defense."
"There role players are not good lmao, Harris is really good, everyone else not so much  And after watching tn I’m not sure Drummond would even help them very much if anything deandre Jordan looked pretty good and I don’t see Drummond helping more than that without canceling it out on offense  I definitely don’t think it’s a automatic ring if they get Drummond lmao"
Same here with landry shamet and deandre jordan
Marc Gasol getting bullied by Deandre Jordan. Washed vs washed. LOL. Lakers really dumb to let Dwight go.
Need to see the Nets and Jazz play. Just dudes constantly shooting 3s though Gobert would send Deandre Jordan to the shadow realm
"Says that, then ducks behind Deandre Jordan...lol"
"Let’s keep the toxicity down guys. 3 compliments to the Nets:  - KD, Kyrie, and Harden on one team. What I mess around with on 2k has come to life. Nasty scoring. 🔥  - Joe Harris and Shamet are providing solid roles as straight shooters. Even Deandre Jordan shows up from time to time when it matters 🔥  - Off ball movement that Nash and co have implemented leaves one player given a good look. 🔥  Good team at 2nd in the East, and I don’t think we’ve seen the best version of this team yet. Any more moves and trades can only make this team a real threat 🙏"
lakers making Deandre Jordan look like lob city DJ that's actually impressive
The deandre drop coverage is forcing that. Lakers need to switch gasol with Trez to force Jordan out
No AD is massive vs us. He’d have Deandre Jordan fouled out with 20 minutes to play
"Deandre Jordan, the king of rotating to someone who doesn't need to be rotated to."
oh wow deAndre Jordan is playing but he didn't start.  Good for Brooklyn.
Y’all see the nets tweet where they’re giving away a DeAndre Jordan jersey to someone that RTs it and it has more comments than RTs and they’re all shitting on it.   Lmfaooo
"And??? They still were better constructed with the nets are now. If we had Lowry, Powell, FVV, Siakim, Ibaka and gasol as role players instead of Deandre Jordan, TLC, Jeff green, Tyler freaking Johnson and Bruce brown. We’d be the indisputable favorites lmaoooo.   In 2019 harden lost to the warriors in the second round. Same way he’s lose to the bucks/Sixers.  And then you say kawhi wasn’t the real FMVP.... yea this convo over lmaoo convo done"
And apparently so are poor defenders of jokic is 4th and Deandre Jordan is 15th
Not with Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan guarding Giannis
Deandre Jordan forgot about Deandre Jordan
I don’t ever remember Blake being on the same level as Lebron and KD lol. If either of them played with a prime CP3 and prime Deandre Jordan they would’ve won a championship.
"&gt; Plus, Iverson was their starting shooting guard and leading scorer, but he was pretty much the worst shooter on the team.   You're assuming that other players on the team could have shot better, if given the same workload Iverson had.   DeAndre Jordan (76% TS) is a significantly more efficient shooter than Kevin Durant (65% TS). Does that mean KD is a worse shooter? Or does it reflect more on the fact that KD has to carry an offensive burden that DJ doesn't? Is Kevon Looney (66% TS) an equally good shooter as Steph (66% TS)? Or does Looney get much easier shots, because Steph draws all the defensive attention?   Iverson carrying the offensive workload allowed his teammates to focus on what their respective strengths were, just like KD and Steph allow their teammates to focus on other things besides creating their own offense.   If you watched the 2001 Sixers, a lot of times what would happen is Iverson would drive, draw multiple defenders, and basically just flip it up towards the rim for his teammates to get an easy offensive rebound and putback. On the stat sheet, that's a negative play for Iverson (0/1 FG). In reality, Iverson created that score by drawing the interior defenders to himself, which created the scoring opportunity for his teammates - it's as much as ""assist"" as Rudy Gobert setting a good screen, or Mark Jackson dribbling in place at the top of the key while Reggie Miller runs off 3 different screens.    In 2000-01, the Sixers were 5th in Offensive Rebounds, despite being only 19th in FGA. They were 2nd in OffReb%. That's in part due to defending bigs having to leave their man to help against Iverson.   In the 2001 Eastern playoffs, the Sixers were 7-2 when Iverson shot 30+ FGA. They were 4-5 when he shot fewer than 30 FGA. If Iverson were hurting his team by shooting, those W-L records should be reversed."
"I mean there was a time when Hassan Whiteside, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond were considered ""elite"" centers. Today's big men are definitely thriving compared to that."
Lebron Deandre Jordan Klay
You forgot DeAndre Jordan
"Maybe y’all can trade Jordan for Serge, contracts match. Would be kinda odd seeing Deandre Jordan in a Clippers jersey though 🤔"
"He's just not very good, like at all. Nothing personal. Do you hate DeAndre Jordan or do you just think he sucks?"
"Pretty sure it’s the other way around for KD. A lot of centres are listed at 7’ but in reality are 6’10-11”, like Cousins, Dwight Howard or DeAndre Jordan however KD is not one of these cases- he’s listed as shorter than 7’ but in reality he plays over 7’ because he’s like 6’11.5” without shoes"
I’m looking forward to the head-to-head match up of...........               Gasol and DeAndre Jordan 🤣
Better than Deandre Jordan.
They'll get worse if they play him. They don't really need scoring from the C position. They need defense and AD is nothing more than another DeAndre Jordan.
"He was fortunate to start his career during the last few years where big men who put up good counting stats but were actually negative on offense and much worse on defense than their counting stats would suggest could still be viewed as elite players.  Think Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Hassan Whiteside.  Teams have gotten much much smarter about this archetype in the past 5 years."
"That's not the way basketball works. Even Deandre Jordan in his prime was only getting ~50% of his buckets from dunks, and he was a much better dunker than Drummond."
the whole game is statpadding when you're up against deandre jordan
Against Deandre Jordan tho. I swear DJ doesn’t put in any effort unless he’s going up against an All Star center
I would never get inbetween DeAndre Jordan and Doc's dinner. It might become a hostage situation
Fuck Deandre Jordan bro
Met blake and deandre jordan back in 2015 in Tijuana.   Stand up guy for sure
Fucking 14-21 from 3 yet only up 6. Sickening defense. Whiteside must have had like 4 easy putbacks with 0 resistance because Deandre Jordan is continuing to be a $40 million cumstain.
"I mean Nash cant roll out a lineup with Kyrie, Shamet, Tyler johnson, TLC, and DeAndre Jordan and expect us to get stops"
"Drummonds rebounding would be amazing for nets. A big reason for their defense being trash is cause they're up there for opponent FGA. Most of that is cause of them giving up offensive rebounds and turnovers. Having him will get rid of one of that problems, which will definitely help their defensive improve. Plus even if he's not a defensive monster he still an upgrade over DeAndre Jordan."
DeAndre Jordan yammin it on Brandon Knight + the ball bouncin' back on his head? God damn LOL. Even his teammates were unsure of whether or not Knight was still alive.
"Because people don’t realize how crazy good Adams is, his numbers don’t reflect how good he is at all. Pretty sure his team’s offensive rebounding percentage is crazy higher with him on the court than off the court for his career. And people don’t understand how smart he is, Adams makes all the stuff he does look easy but only a couple guys in the league can do what he does.  That’s why he’s still a good player playing his style and got $40/2 year extension last offseason. Him, Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Clint Capela, and Rudy Gobert are the only starting centers in the league who still play that way, and Jordan probably shouldn’t even be a starter anymore (maybe Jarrett Allen should take his spot in this list though). It’s REALLY hard to play center in the league without a three point shot now."
"Context matters here. He’s playing like he’s Joel Embiid. He’s more like Deandre Jordan. Except instead of having Chris Paul he’s had Reggie Jackson and Sexton who have objectively been two of the worst passing starting PGs in recent history. At the peak in Detroit he shot 65% around the rim. I think if he’s paired with a good passing PG and sticks to screening/cutting/crashing the glass he’ll be a way more efficient ~15 PPG scorer than what he is now. He can’t finish post ups, layups, ISO’s (anything that requires touch) but he’s a fantastic lob finished when he just needs to dunk and not finish off the dribble. I think he’d be a great pairing for a PG like Lamelo who would flourish as a lob passer with an athletic freak at the 5.   The Cavs started the season pretty well when Drummond was engaged. He’s been a centerpiece of (crappy) playoff teams. He’s just an average center getting paid as an all nba one, but average would be an upgrade for a few teams."
"Us Pistons fans are laughing at the majority of r/nba for something we've known for years now. I don't think Drummond is a terrible player, but he's way too inconsistent. He's an amazing rebounder, but he doesn't really bring anything else to the table. His defense has always been massively overrated (idk if his rebounding inflates his defensive rankings) and his offense has always been pedestrian outside of putbacks and alley-oops.   He's basically a better rebounding/worse defending (younger) DeAndre Jordan, except he thinks he's Wilt Chamberlain."
But he is a big tall strong guy who can rebound and dunk the ball   When Deandre Jordan is filling that role for your team you’ll take any form of improvement
"Tbf both of those accolades were absolutely ridiculous, he got all-NBA the year DeAndre Jordan was the first team center and everyone agrees the DPOY vote was a joke. The guy that voted Drummond put Hassan Whiteside as his second choice"
This is insulting to TT who actually had offensive skill and touch around the basket.  Drummond is like DeAndre Jordan trying to play back to the basket like he's Hakeem.
"Deandre Jordan.. joking, I think he said Obama"
Deandre Jordan over Brandon Knight
"Same. Also had the following happen this week: Mitchell Robinson, Hayward sit out, Herro sit out, Deandre Jordan sit out, Deandre Hunter undergo surgery, Anthony Davis, and then picked up Paul Millsap Saturday night only for him to get hurt also.   Meanwhile the team I played against had 4/5 keeps play four games. Murray had 8 steals on game, Porzingis had 6 blocks... I have the absolute worst luck in fantasy. I think of the 8 weeks so fae I've had an advantage in players once by two guys and I've also been outnumbered anywhere between 7-14."
"This will sound laughable, but I swear there was this moment in time around 2015 and 2016 where Stan Van Gundy's system was kind of humming in Detroit. It was the ""Form a Wall"" era, and Brandon Jennings, D.J. Augustin, and Reggie Jackson all had their own moments where they looked like point gods.   In the 15 games prior to blowing out his Achilles, Brandon Jennings was averaging 20 and 7 (including a 24-point, 21-assist performance). Then D.J. Augustin slipped into the lineup and averaged 20 and 8 until he was dealt for Reggie Jackson. Then Jackson came out and played like a borderline all-star in 2016.   During that time, you'd catch a lot of moments where you could see what Drummond could be, when he was just dining on alley-oop setups from Jennings, Augustin, and Jackson (aka, the DeAndre Jordan approach). Then again, he was still making bonehead mistakes, still playing outside himself, and as a capper, he was shooting 35 percent from the line.  His Pistons career largely consisted of easing him along, getting him reps as a means of developing and broadening his game, then finally you had Drummond deciding he was going to be whatever he wanted to be (aka 3-point shooting, playmaking Andre). He's a DeAndre who wants to be more than DeAndre."
Deandre Jordan is shooting 78.6% this year but the cut off must be 5+ FGA beause he's only at 4 FGA this year.
"Honestly the Nets are probably the best place for him.  He's talented but he needs to be limited to the few things he does well. I feel next to KD, Harden, and Kyrie he would have enough respect to just be the ultimate role player he was meant to be.  He can do the things that you want Deandre Jordan to do, he just also tries to do way more than that."
You'd have to lose Dinwiddie and Deandre Jordan to get him. That'd be a massive hit for next season's depth when Dinwiddie comes back.
It was still moratorium. It would’ve been just like the Deandre Jordan situation from a few years ago where the player changes their mind due to a new offer.
"Drummond's making nearly 3 times as much as Deandre Jordan, the salaries aren't even anywhere close enough unless the Nets throws in one from Joe Harris/Spencer Dinwiddie.     Drummond's nowhere near good enough to warrant such a trade."
How about passing the ball to Deandre Jordan and he fumbles the ball while standing completely still at the top of the key? Sounds like your situation is at least not a fast break lol
Also valid. But you also need someone other than deandre jordan.
"I always hear this but where would a guy with zero post game and zero offensive game with touch-and-go heart and effort have fit among David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, Patrick Ewing, Rik Smits, Rony Seikaly, Vlade Divac, Alonzo Mourning, and Dikembe Mutombo?   If anything, his effect would have been muted in the 90's on account of no longer rebounding in an empty paint and without the rim-running pick-and-roll strategy of the 2000's that allowed guys like DeAndre Jordan to contribute offensively despite limited skills on that front.   If you were just being sarcastic, then nevermind me."
Deandre Jordan + a 2nd take it or leave it
I hear that DeAndre Jordan fella is quite large
"This is my time to shine. In six to eight years of watching most of his games, here's a rudimentary outlook.  **Pros**  * Clears the defensive glass (though often in an empty, contested paint). Clears boards regardless.   * Can finish with dunk on pick &amp; roll when lob is delivered above the rim.  * Sticks with his own misses, often tipping own shot three to four times in one single possession.   **Cons**  * Arguably the worst post game in modern history among all-star centers who still feel obligated to get touches (Ben Wallace couldn't post-up either but at least knew what he was and wasn't).   * One of his go-to moves in half-court offense is a running 13-foot floater.   * Shoots 59 percent from the free throw line, which is somehow a 20 percent improvement over what he used to shoot. Has been hovering in 59 percent range for four seasons.   * Has attempted 92 3-pointers over the past four seasons. That's 92 attempts too many for someone shooting 10.9 percent from three.   * Offensive rebounds often inflated on account of re-tipping his own point blank misses inside that should have been finished in the first place.  * Shooting just 47.4 percent from the field despite being built in the mold of a Clint Capela or DeAndre Jordan. In contrast, teammate Jarrett Allen is currently shooting 64.6 percent.   * Has a .500 total shooting percentage... for a guy who generally should never be shooting outside of three feet. Again, for comparison, teammate Jarrett Allen currently has a 69.5 percent total shooting percentage.  * Sometimes tries defensively, sometimes not.   * Subject to ill-timed fouls.  * Will openly mope when things aren't going his way, at times manifesting itself in lingering in the backcourt while an opposing team breaks out in the open floor for a back-breaking 3-pointers during an 5-on-4 advantage in transition leading to a time-out."
Celtics are really about to trade for Drummond and have two centers that Embiid feasts on trying to match up with him.   That or the Nets are about to unload Harris and whatever else they have left to get a big man that isn’t a 32 year old DeAndre Jordan.
Is he really playing better though? I'm still trying to figure out how he's taking over 15 shots a game with a DeAndre Jordan skillset yet is managing to shoot just 47.5 percent from the field.
"Per bballref he is 6th.  Only behind DeAndre Jordan who only dunks and has 9ppg over his career, Cedric Maxwell with 12,5 ppg, Tyson Chandler who also only takes shots at the rim, Steph Curry, and Artis Gilmore.    I get that much of what KAT does, doesn't really matter regarding a title, but he does all that with a crappy team which is really impressive. He would only do better with a better supporting cast."
"If he’s got the exact same skill set and has a 40 inch vert (with more speed) I think so yeah. Imagine if Jokic could dunk like prime DeAndre Jordan lmao. Would literally be a more athletic 7 foot tall, stronger Magic Johnson."
Last year he was pretty good defensively this year I don't think he's better than DeAndre Jordan. And offensively if he isn't hitting his 3s hes not good cause he can't post up anybody
Tell that to Deandre Jordan
Kellerman also recently said Deandre Jordan is the nets most crucial player.
Andre Drummond  A D  D A  DeAndre Jordan  Illuminati  plausible
#CHRIS PAULS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT WAS GETTING DEANDRE JORDAN ALL NBA FIRST TEAM
"&gt; has made Luwaru-Cabarot and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan valuable contributors on Day 1.  Lol... Go ask Nets fans about DJ. He's about as useful as he was last season, that is say, the entire Nets fanbase wants a new center.   Also, TLC's production hasn't really changed from last year besides a dip in efficiency.   &gt; Still, right after he left Houston after 2018 he dropped off in every facet just months after  Yeah.   He went from guarding Curry and Durant every second he was on the court to no longer being a plus defender.  That wasn't losing Harden, that was losing his athleticism.   &gt;He's waaay worse now after all that mileage and his value is low enough to where you coulda snagged him and made him a decent enough contributor on limited minutes  Except in your plan he's playing major minutes as a core rotation piece.  &gt;Harden woulda made all your promising youngins with all this untapped potential you Cs fans have been raving about into valuable role players.  No, because we're struggling with consistency from those guys on both ends.   Grant Williams, for example, has the potential to be a good player but he's a foul magnet and Harden doesn't fix that issue at all.    &gt; I've been dumbfounded by how much this sub (and the NBA fandom in general) undervalues Harden and other stars in trades.  No, it's more that you're overvaluing him.   He's an incredible MVP level player, but Harden + 1 guy doesn't win you a championship. You need to have a proper roster constructed around them.   * DeAndre Jordan is a defensive liability against key matchups - With or without Harden * Ariza slowed down too much to be a positive 3&amp;D player - With or without Harden * PJ Tucker's defence has declined with his age - With or without Harden * Grant Williams + Semi Ojeleye + Aaron Nesmith have **potential** but won't magically become consistent defenders overnight - With or without Harden * Romeo Langford has been a fantastic defender but he can't stay healthy - With or without Harden  Also, Harden isn't making guys elite on the defensive end. Which, without you realising, a lot of your argument seems to stem from.  You need to be elite on both ends to win a title. That Houston team you're referencing was the only Houston team that was a serious title contender and they were the only Houston team that was good defensively (6th in the league).  Harden doesn't win with the 15th rated defence (who would be even lower after the trade)."
"&gt;Harden helped but you're pretending like he magically made them all good until he left.  No, I didn't. I simply stated Harden's elevated all their play, just like he'd elevate all your role players' play because you have no playmaker. Harden has made Luwaru-Cabarot and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan valuable contributors on Day 1.  &gt;PJ was struggling before Harden left  Not really. He was huge to the very end but Houston worked the HELL out of him by making him Center for 45 min a game while he had nerve damage.  He's waaay worse now after all that mileage and his value is low enough to where you coulda snagged him and made him a decent enough contributor on limited minutes   &gt;Gordon has struggled pretty consistently since that series and is only playing well again now that Harden is gone  Gordon was real down for a while last year, but caught up by the end due to getting open off Harden double teams. He's the only player actually playing better now without MDA as he's getting different touches outside of catch &amp; shoot, as he was playin well with Harden this year under Silas before he left because of a different system  &gt;Ariza is just old at this point and injuries have caught up to him, he's no longer quick enough to be the good defender he used to be (and he was HUUUUUUUUGE defensively for them that series)  Of course, Ariza is washed now. Still, *right after* he left Houston after 2018 he dropped off in every facet just months after  &gt;Capella is playing just fine without Harden  True, but Harden made him what he is and he was doing even better in Houston offensively due to Harden.  &gt;Anderson, Moute and Green pretty much had his career ended by injuries  But he made them all better when playing with him. Look up their stats, film, and performance outside of playin with Harden compared to with him  Harden woulda made all your promising youngins with all this untapped potential you Cs fans have been raving about into valuable role players. Your big men would be averaging 10 ppg more days after the trade, Harden's gravity from double teams woulda given Tatum and company great opportunities, you'd have a real playmaker and be contenders  I dont mean to be a snobby ass about it, but I'm just invested in this conversation about what teams missed out on by not trading for Harden  &gt;You're stating all these facts about other teams, but it's clear you weren't really keeping up with them.  Ironically enough, you talk confidently for someone who doesn't keep up with the facts either. The only reason I'm commenting is because I've been dumbfounded by how much this sub (and the NBA fandom in general) undervalues Harden and other stars in trades. It's been mind boggling to see assets like Herro and Maxey become untouchable assets for a trade for one of the most valuable &amp; durable players we've ever seen.  Good talk tho. Engaging convo, I need to stop writing on this post lmao"
"To inform people that Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Deandre Jordan combine for 110.7 pts/game on 66% TS"
Okay so I'm trying to process all of that.  So you're saying that Harden should be guarding power forwards? That's a pretty interesting idea I'm not sure how that would go And  I agree that Kyrie's defense isn't going to to make any all defense teams but it's not a detriment like someone like Trae Young for example.  And I'm not sure what you were implying about Deandre Jordan I think you are saying that his defensive game isn't that great and I would probably agree with you on that. I'm not sure if that's what you meant.  But this is essentially a Mike D'Antoni coached team of course Steve Nash is the head coach but D'Antoni is his top assistant and was Nash's Head coach during his best year's as a player and it's pretty much a version of his seven seconds offense that Nash played under and he taylored to James Harden later and all of the iterations defense was pretty much an elective course.  I'm not sure what to think about this Nets team on one hand this style of play has never been able to get a title The Rockets got pretty close with Chris Paul and Harden But the idea of the Three headed monster they have with KD Kyrie and Harden wonder's if they could out gun everyone else and maybe get a title.  Or maybe you can't get around fundimentals and defense always wins championships I guess we're going to see and I took an edible earlier and just realized I've been rambling writing a goddamn article about this shit and I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about so I'm going to end this here.
To inquire as to the increase in talent if the Nets were to replace DeAndre Jordan with Rudy Gobert.   Not sure what you're confused about.
Do you know the bigs the Hornets currently have? Deandre jordan today is better than Biz and Zeller.
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
"The spacing and talent that Lamelo has opens up the floor for him to operate in ways Luka never had due to roster construction. Luka had a near-death Deandre Jordan, a ""supposed"" NBA player in Dennis Smith Jr, a Wesley Matthews that played like JR Smith, and a Harrison ""horse-blinders"" Barnes that passed maybe once out of a drive all season."
"Yeah I’d have a prime KAT over him too. No disrespect to Boogie but he also played mostly in an era where his best competitor was Deandre Jordan. Now we have 2-3 guys that can up 27+ PPG on 60% TS in their sleep, and Cousins was never that good."
"The way the docu described it was the very basic free throw mechanics that were taught to players by coaches since the early basketball days, were made with guards in mind, and feature a full range of motion starting below the hip and ending over the head. But when you get guys that are 6'10 and 7 foot and teach them that same mechanic, it's gonna have way different results because of the extended proportions of their bodies. Add in the strength of these big players like, dwight howard, shaq, wilt, deandre jordan, andre drummond, lebron james, Hakeem, etc. Etc. Etc. And those free throw mechanics that work for smaller guys are just not gonna work for them.   There's a reason these these dudes can't hit free throws at a high clip besides nerves. I mean think of Tim Duncan, ""the big fundamentals"" but he shot 63% from the line."
I mean he'll probably get covered for his flaws by the other three but... Deandre Jordan?  Also right now if the Knicks make the playoffs I'll say RJ Barrett.  But only due to youth and inexperience.
I hated DeAndre Jordan when he was with us.
"&gt;Efg% is not measuring scoring. It is measuring live action shooting.  It's just a combination of 3pt% and 2pt%. Unless you are clarifying layups, dunks, post play as shooting, it just isn't a shooting measurement. e.g. DeAndre Jordan and Rudy Gobert lead the all time NBA career eFG list. I don't think anyone wants to argue they are better shooters than Curry lmao.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/efg_pct_career.html   If you want a stat measuring shooting, you'd be better off just using the part of eFG that best measures shooting, 3PT%, but actual shooting stats also exist. e.g. https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201939/shooting/"
"What are you talking about. Dwight Powell for 11M a Year is pretty solid. He doesn't have the greatest Year because Kleber and Porziņģis play ahead of him, but he in todays league where a Gorbert gets 200M ...33M/3 is a solid Deal.   And Deandre Jordan got a 1 Year Deal and we traded him away quickly."
"Lebron James played 13 years in the nba before Deandre Jordan made an all star game. Lebron was drafted in 2003, DJs first all star game was 2017"
"I mean bro, Lakers are a strong team, but not a super team. We don’t have three absolute stars, just two.   If you told someone that the nets would have Kevin Durant, Kylie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan with Steve Nash fucking coaching them they wouldn’t believe it. They probably would try to send David Stern into the future to stop it."
I don’t care what it is biased towards....points are points and hardens puts me Up much more effectively. I never even mentioned the fact that giannis pretty much just scores within 3 feet. He can’t shoot from anywhere else. Yes his fg% is higher but that’s because all he does is get paint points which the refutes you’re first point about ts % being biased because fg% is biased towards paint players/scorers ala deandre Jordan. If Harden wanted to he could easily score more points than giannis on better efficiency and we’ve seen that before in previous seasons. Like I already said 5 assists &gt; 3 boards and those other minute useless stats you’re comparing.
What? DeAndre Jordan once made First Team All NBA? What the heck happened that season?
No he’s referring to Deandre Jordan
deandre jordan is such fucking trash
DeAndre Jordan is so fucking bad my god
"""A disgusting act by DeAndre Jordan"""
deandre jordan looks like a plant someone's gently misting to keep it fresh
Someone once said Deandre Jordan reminds them of Brittany Griner and now I can’t not see it. I think it was one of the times he missed a dunk lol
you are telling me you think kd is better than deandre jordan!?!?
I feel as though it is disrespectful to call Deandre Jordan “Jordan”
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
"yeah, Deandre Jordan and Derrick Rose are hardly who I would want to be a gauge of team excellence"
"Brooklyn’s super stars: KD, James Harden, Deandre Jordan"
That was Deandre Jordan-esque
Deandre Jordan as well. Kind of softens the point being made here
"The thing is he's good but highly match up dependent, commits lots of fouls and can't dribble very well. He will get bodied by bigger centers such as Embiid, Gobert, KAT, even guys like Deandre Jordan can post him up due to his lack of size. Those are the reasons why he only gets 22 MPG but he's still a good bench piece to have on your team as a 6th or 7th man. 2 second rounders might be good plus another player but he definitely isn't worth 2 firsts."
I forgot about Deandre Jordan too!
Lol this is almost fucked up like the one deandre Jordan did to someone I forgot who
This is deandre jordan over brandon knight level disgusting. Yes?
"Nah not up in the air brother, just a one dribble. They stop it on the way up. Deandre Jordan comes to mind first."
"Seriously I saw this had 3k upvotes so I was expecting a nice dunk, but *holy fuck*.  This is the most disgusting dunk I've seen since DeAndre Jordan on Brandon Knight.  I watched it like 15 times in absolute shock."
Deandre Jordan made the first team without being an all-star in 2016
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
Joe harris is shooting 50% from 3 on 7 attempts per game... He's obviously not as good as Klay but you're proving my point with that comment. The sheer fire power of the nets allows him to get way better looks than klay would. Deandre jordan is a way bigger lob threat than draymond which is all the nets need him to be. Also idk why you're being such an asshole. I came in here to comment and talk basketball but was called names by other people including you.  Stephen A Smith even mentioned that Kyrie should be on the MVP list.
"If you are using the same site, their qualifier is averaging 8.8 points per game. Is that the average points per game of nba players I wonder? It feels a little arbitrary but maybe not.  Zubac is at 71% on 8.2 ppg. DeAndre Jordan is 74% on 7.5 ppg  Either way Jingles is impressive as a non-big, that leaderboard is all dunkers or elite scorers"
Deandre Jordan is probably one of the worst starting centers in the league.
"Lonzo. I mean, DeAndre Jordan is nice but Lonzo is more valuable imo."
"Honestly, no.  Sure, talent-wise, there's a lot there. I'm not convinced their defense can contain anyone, especially bigs like EMVPIID, AD or even a dude like Bam Adebayo.  I'm also not convinced that the rest of their roster can stay healthy, and if you attack DeAndre Jordan all game in a pick and roll - fairly certain that is a weakness of his. Buckets."
"you're right man my fault. guess joe harris &gt; klay thompson and deandre jordan &gt; draymond green eh? don't forget about hall of famer nick claxton and bruce brown. not even the 96 bulls could beat them! don't forget KD's telepathic powers, being able to contribute to this hot streak right now while even on the bench in a hoodie!"
"&gt;  but Milwaukee and Philly are both set up to exploit their main weakness, which is of course DeAndre Jordan.  While this is true, neither of those teams have enough plus defenders that *also* meaningfully contribute to the offense to match up well to the Nets' big 3 either.  Simmons, Thybulle, and...Harris I guess?   I don't think that's enough for the big 3 as there will always be a mismatch and Thybulle is someone Brooklyn can leave open on the perimeter, not unlike Houston did with Dort in the postseason last year."
"Great game.  I say this fully believing the Nets are the favorites from the East, but Milwaukee and Philly are both set up to exploit their main weakness, which is of course DeAndre Jordan. He may have had a near double double tonight but we ate him up on the offensive glass. When it's Embiid or Giannis finishing that instead of Plumlee, it's gonna result in a bunch of and 1s. They better start accelerating the switch to Claxton."
Deandre Jordan is a huge liability.
"They're already outgunning most teams and KD adds defense and offense.  Pretty insane squad.   Joe Harris, Harden, Kyrie, and DeAndre Jordan should be giving up 120 every night but somehow they aren't.  We just have to accept that they might be pretty decent defensively."
"How is the APG not impressive? He doesn’t even assist kyrie often and didn’t asisst KD much either in all the 6 games they played together. He gets his assists from jordan/brown/green/harris, and joe Harris 3p% is boosted by the looks harden gives him. The guys harden gets assists to are worse or the same as other elite point guards, thats nonsense.   Everyone calls Deandre washed AF and claxton is a literal g leaguer. This is nonsense"
This hypothetical is basically pointless in an era of zone and PNR switching. You can go from guarding DeAndre Jordan to James Harden in the span of 5 seconds and vice versa
"as much as I still despise the Deandre signing, he's been playing a lot better during this win streak. Showing some actual aggressiveness and effort on the boards and boxing out. Still doesn't bother defending the perimeter, but w.e not like that would be effective.  My biggest issue with him now is the fucking turnovers. At 25.1% he has the second highest turnover rate in the entire NBA. That is despicable. We can't be wasting possessions in a KD/Kyrie/Harden offense with a goddamn Deandre Jordan turnover. Dude lathers his hands in jelly before games."
deandre jordan more or less just runs up and down the court
Ask him how he feels about DeAndre Jordan.
What a stupid saying though. Embiid playing 80% of the time is better than Deandre Jordan playing every game.
"Since most of his playing days was with Chris Paul who had the ball in his hands most of the time, or DeAndre Jordan grabbing rebounds."
"They’ve already figured it out, as of now he’s staying, that was never really a discussion. Of course if an All NBA talent becomes available then he would be offered, but again, there’s been no rumours on this. The Warriors also don’t need the reincarnation of David Robinson. They need a big man who can rebound, protect the rim, catch lobs, and maybe stretch the floor a bit. Wiseman matches that. If they wanted a real scorer, they would’ve traded the pick on draft night. Wiseman always had Deandre Jordan comparisons, meaning he was never supposed to be a 25 PPG shot creator. He was drafted to fill a role that he’s already done fairly well."
Drummond would pretty muh be DeAndre Jordan if he was actually good at what he does for the nets
"&gt;Durant - 29/7.3/5.3 on 65.2%TS (5.4 BPM)  Durant has played 18 games this season. James Harden has played more games as a Net than Kevin Durant.  &gt;Harden also has Harris who is averaging 15ppg on 70%TS and shooting the three at a 50% clip  I mean, you can look at the stats of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Tyler Johnson before and after the Harden trade. All of those players have had an insane jump in offensive production. In fact, Nick Claxton has more than doubled his production with only 3 additional minutes played compared to last season.   Everyone thought the Nets depleted their depth for Harden but anyone who watches the game can see Harden is getting the most out of everyone. Guys that were 3rd string are now quality contributors. That's a pretty clear definition of an MVP."
Good point. I expect the Nets to beat the sixers so you might not have to worry about AD guarding Deandre Jordan or Nicoloas Claxton. I fully expect the Lakers to repeat and for Lebron to eventually be the GOAT.
"Giannis boutta put up prime Wilt numbers against DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, and Blake"
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
"People are so tough on him. That said, I always thought it was a mistake because he looked like Deandre Jordan in his highlights. He's actually more skilled in shooting and dribbling than I thought he was. Still a mistake to take him over Lamelo but I think he'll turn out fine"
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
"How tf did you get all of that from me calling Dwight the better lob threat and pnr partner lol?   You said  &gt; Lol what on earth is Dwight doing without the ball  And to answer that, he’s doing much more infact. Joel is good at lobs but Dwight is an all time great lob threat, many even consider him the best. Not to mention one of Embiid’s biggest knocks is that he isn’t a great pnr big, something you don’t have to even think about with Dwight. Shooting is great but when you’re taking 3 threes w gane ...  And yes lol, DeAndre Jordan is the better offball center, with the ball Joel is a million times better, but you don’t even know the wonders guys like DeAndre Jordan, Shawn Kemp, Amare Stoudemire, and Dwight do for their PGs. Joel is good but you’re hyping him up like he’s Anthony Davis or Kristaps Porzingis off the ball"
starting Blake Griffin or DeAndre Jordan in 2021 is not a good thing
"And Dwight isn’t close to Embiid as a shooter. Is Deandre Jordan a better off ball player than Embiid as well?   I’d rather have the shooting, not to mention even if this argument held up imo I don’t see how Dwight would be more valuable on offense even if I granted him that"
"Yeah no way former MVPs Kevin Durant and James Harden, and all NBA player Kyrie Irving can do it without washed DeAndre Jordan."
PG: Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry   SG: FVV/Duncan Robinson/Derrick White   SF: Joe Harris/Kyle Kuzma   PF:  Kevin Love/Blake Griffin   C: DeAndre Jordan/Andre Drummond/JaVale McGree  Is this the worst possible team you could assemble out of that finalists?     Edit. I am not sure about Point Guards
Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan being there is such bullshit. Ja is probably the biggest snub
That's 2016 First Team All-NBA Center DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan back in the day
I’m sorry but Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan don’t deserve to be there
"They added Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan to this list in 2021, on purpose. Like they actually discussed it and decided that those two players could be Olympic caliber players."
"Giannis was stopped in the playoffs as a result of excellent team defense and personnel that was perfect to defend him. The raptors built a wall with help from ibaka, gasol, siakam, and kawhi. The heat defended him well with a wall from crowder, butler, and adabayo. Deandre jordan and KD aren't nearly as good defenders as those guys"
I counter that with the all-time -an team:   Michael Jordan DeMar Derozan Dennis Rodman Tim Duncan DeAndre Jordan
"Deandre Jordan is terrible, I think it is hilarious before they got Harden ""NETS BIG THREE DURANT, IRVING, JORDAN"""
NGL I would fucking LAUGH if deandre jordan AND blake griffin get a ring and chris paul doesn't.
Yes. Deandre jordan is a prime example
Look no further than Deandre Jordan still getting  significant minutes
"Blake Griffin: Will I get playing time over there?   Deandre Jordan: Look at me. I'm getting 23 mpg. Have you seen my knees lately?   Blake Griffin: Say no more   Deandre Jordan: Seriously look at my knees, something's wrong. I need some medical advice   Blake Griffin: Shut up before I change my mind"
All nba isnt always the best 15 guys. Position issues have kicked some people out of it or put some bums in ie deandre jordan 1st team
"&gt; easily a 15 RPG guy if he felt like doing it.  Lamar Odom only cleared 10rpg twice in his career. Only 4 players in the last 20 years (drummond, love, deandre jordan and ben wallace) have cleared 15rpg  So yeh, not easily, and not even close."
"Are you talking about how theres no goaltendin rule?  IIRC, Deandre Jordan made use of that really well in FIBA yearsss ago"
And that one time DeAndre Jordan aggressively hugged Blake after he dunked on Perk https://youtu.be/d8vbdA0wGuI
Yes but also in what world was Brandon Knight ever stopping stopping a young Deandre Jordan bouncing like that
Deandre Jordan gets plenty of rebounds but he hasn’t historically improved his teams rebounding when on the court.
"Assuming you can convince KD and Kyrie to let you trade Jordan does OKC accept?  My only concern is Deandre Jordan on that contract being too much of a negative that isn’t really offset by Shamet, expiring plus seconds."
He'd fit well but...  1. The Nets most likely wouldn't trade DeAndre Jordan since KD and Kyrie brought him there and each took pay cuts for him.  2. To match salary it'd need to be something like DeAndre+Dinwiddie+Shamet.  3. The Thunder would most likely want more than just salary matching in return. Or at least wait another year and then take on bad long term money for Horford with a pick as compensation.
What if you put CP3 with Deandre Jordan?
They also have a former all nba first team player deandre Jordan
Having zero interior protection is not going to work in the playoffs unless you're the Nets and even they have DeAndre Jordan to do some work.
"He played in an era with actual good forwards/centers, if he didnt have to retire he would have definitely had more, those mid-2010 teams had Drummond, DeAndre Jordan.."
"Bro you dont even need Middelton, Jrue and Murray, Jokic and Giannis with 3 half decent spot up shooters would destroy the Nets. Who could guard them? Deandre Jordan? A washed Blake Griffin?"
"Chauncey's on the edge, imo, I think he deserves to be in but I could see the argument.  Basketball Reference puts Chauncey at an 84.4% chance to get in (comparable to Paul George, Jack Sikma, JoJo White), Wallace at 45.3% (comparable to Clyde Lovelette, Chris Mullin, Paul Westphal), Rasheed at an 8.57% (comparable to Glen Rice, Elton Brand) Rip Hamilton at a 1.76% (comparable to DeAndre Jordan, Antoine Walker, David Lee).  I think their formula is a little conservative, since there are a few real notable players with way too low of chances (Pistol Pete at 10.2%, KC Jones at 28.7%, etc), and almost every player with at least a 30% chance is in the Hall as is.  For those who may be curious, the best eligible players not in the HoF per this stat are Paul Pierce, Chris Bosh, Larry Foust, Chauncey Billups, and Tim Hardaway."
"Deandre Jordan, all star starter"
"i think you do something similar to what the rockets and clippers have done against the warriors in recent years. you bait durant into playing iso ball, and try to cut off everyone else and kill ball movement.   difference tho is that the warriors had two guys that were amazing off ball, whereas the nets guys are all iso scorers, so iso ball is what brooklyn wants to play. obviously not going to work all of the time, but the less ball movement you get from the nets, the less they can hurt you (especially the role players).  on the other side, obviously you need to take advantage of the nets' lack of inside presence. attack the rim, drive and kick, offensive rebounds. you want to control the possessions and keep the game at a reasonable pace.  you don't want to get into a shootout.  i'm probably in the minority, but i don't think brooklyn is the favorite in the east. i can't trust a team that is going to have to play deandre jordan, jeff green and blake griffin 20+ minutes in a playoff game"
"Get Deandre Jordan in foul trouble, then it's BBQ Chicken for Embiid down low."
Tbh I was gonna say put a wall up because that’s Giannis has been exposed for the last two years tryna bulldoze his way thru but knowing how injury prone Kyrie and KD are rn they might just move out the way. Then again DeAndre Jordan might just put his body on the line
"And a Blake Griffin who has less dunks this season than CP3 at that lmao, If this was prime Lob City Blake fine get tilted I probably would too  But this is old man Blake with no lift lol, he's still a serviceable player but its hardly the end of the world he joined the Nets lol. Not like Blake solves the problem of the Nets having to play DeAndre Jordan 30+mins a night because they traded away Jarrett Allen."
Embiid gets clamped by deandre jordan unfortunately
Absurd on both ends? The only significantly positive defender on that roster is DeAndre Jordan.
Saying that Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are all-stars is like saying the Lakers had all-stars Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard last year.  By this logic DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin are all-stars for the Nets and they have 5 all-stars.
I saw a game there back when their best players were a washed DeAndre Jordan and DSJ. Honestly it was kinda boring compared to the games I’ve been to at Scotiabank Arena/ACC but you could kinda tell that it’d be crazy if the Knicks saw some actual success.
"Uhh, yikes. It'd have to be someone really bad at free throws, but they still somehow shoot a lot of them. DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond come to mind, but besides that, I dunno. Even LeBron is a full 30% better than Big Ben was."
And the nets did sort of build slow and develop young guys with Kenny. Then they threw it all to the side because nobody in their mind is gonna say no to KD and Kyrie but the stability and growth of the franchise was why KD/Kyrie chose brooklyn instead new york  Deandre Jordan snitched on the knicks culture issues on his way out too but that was pre-Thibs
"That’s amazing and not trying to be difficult, but fyi according to bball ref DeAndre Jordan is 1-13 career from 3 (incl. playoffs), and Maxwell was 1-21 (same).  I was curious if D Jordan had really played that many years in this era without even an attempt, so I checked.    Also crazy is the 2 other active players in career top-10 TS%: KAT and Jonas Valančiūnas."
DeAndre Jordan leading a relevant NBA statistic is such a trip
Hasan Whiteside and Deandre Jordan are right there.
Counterpoint: DeAndre Jordan
"There’s definitely doubt. Warriors aren’t a top 8 team in the West with Draymond, Wiggins, Wiseman... that team isn’t bad.  Did you see what Harden was doing with DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, etc?   Curry is a great ceiling raiser. Not a great floor raiser. The floor is the problem with the Warriors."
Good to see that Drummond gives as much effort defensively as DeAndre Jordan
"As long as he's willing to accept that role, it should work. He's always wanted too many post touches when he should play more like DeAndre Jordan, Tyson Chandler, et al."
"Naw we def would remember if Woj got something wrong, you can see in comments sections when a reporter is untrustworthy (e.g. that guy who lied about mark Cuban driving around Dallas looking for DeAndre Jordan house).   Woj and shams are head above the rest in reliability for news."
"I agree on the conditioning aspect of the early 2000s basketball.  Early 90s Shaq aged to the modern game without weight gain and a 12'4 max vertical was who I was referring to.  The trend around the league, however, has been in opposition to your point.  There aren't any sub 50% high volume shooters left and the league as a whole especially over the past 2 years has seen a noticeable increase in ft%.   Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan and Brandon Ingram are all guys who were positionally terrible from the free throw line and made record breaking improvements after working with modern free throw coaching. Even Tacko Fall is finding time on the floor for non-meme minutes after being unplayably bad from the free throw line at USF.  Shaquille O'Neal did not focus as much on free throws, this is known.  He had one good free throw season in LA and basically said ""Im good."". Better coaching and general social pressure would force him to do so today and he wouldn't be one hand scooping the ball like he did with Miami."
Deandre Jordan finds his way back to the lineup yet again
Yeah and DeAndre Jordan is the all-time leader in FG%.  Kyrie takes and makes much more difficult shots around the rim.
"I really don’t think they will. I’m not sure Durant will even be able to play more than 26 minutes in the playoffs, let alone if he’s going to make it all the way to the ECF. That first seed is extremely important for both teams. Whichever team has to go to battle with the Bucks will be in an extreme disadvantage going into the ECF.  I look forward to watching Embiid go against the likes of Blake Griffin’s corpse and DeAndre (1st Quarter Only) Jordan."
Deandre Jordan
"lol no, Kyries handles are more useful, smoother and more effective, Currys  shooting ability allows him to get past people easier since they playing closer to him.  as far as finishing goes, why are you not looking at volume and just %..? Is Deandre jordan the best finisher of all time?"
"It wasn't that long ago that DeAndre Jordan was a great player. His athleticism hasn't even declined, so I'm surprised his playing ability did."
Because your big men are the corpses of deandre jordan and blake griffin.
"It's unfortunate that LMA had to retire, especially because it opens up more minutes for DeAndre Jordan. I think their defense is going to take a big hit. Blake's more of a swiss army knife big at this point, whereas LMA could still provide rim protection using positioning, timing, and his size, so they are going to miss him. And Claxton is fine if they're going small ball, but then they probably need KD to kinda play free safety for additional rim protection, but do you really want him going hard on both offense and defense in the playoffs?"
"DeAndre Jordan is literally those questions that pop up here asking ""would you take &lt;superstar&gt; on your team if you were also required to start &lt;scrub&gt; and play them X minutes every game?"""
"Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet isn't insane depth if luckily 2-3 of them even get  a chance to play in the playoffs for over 5 minutes"
Neither is his free throws    DeAndre Jordan is a better free throw shooter than LeGM
"When the fuck did we start calling DeAndre Jordan ""DAJ""?"
Uncle Dennis vs DeAndre Jordan
"&gt;if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  what are you talking about? what stat did i use that has that? ts% certainly does not.  and we're not talking about whether or not he can be good or has any potential, i've never claimed that he doesn't, we're comparing him to the players above him who are on the list. scoring efficiency is not the end-all be-all, but when your game is predicated mostly on only being a scorer, it's something important we need to look at.  mikal bridges is a 41% three point shooter with 64%ts, literally one of the most efficient scorers in the entire league and will probably make an all-defensive team this year  john collins scored 21 on 65% ts last season, miles and miles ahead of RJ as a scorer.   deandre ayton an elite rebounder, anchor of one of the best defenses in the league while scoring 15 per game on 62% from the floor  deandre hunter again an elite defender already with 62%ts  lonzo is a much better defender and a better distributor, while being  more efficient.  RJ giving you 17 points on 15 shots just isn't that impressive in comparison considering what else he brings. he could develop into a great player and recently has been looking much better, but you're acting like a spot on this list is owed to him when he hasn't proven anything really in comparison to guys who made it onto the list. he might have a case for an honorable mention or an argument for the last spot on the list, but to act like he's some crazy snub and deserves to be on over the guys you listed is legitimately just a stupid opinion that makes it look like you already were a fan of his and saw ppg and thought that's the only thing that matters."
I posted 1 photo where they are side by side but You can check many other photos of KD and Lebron side by side (try to check those they took when they were training together in summer 2012) and you'll see the same big gap between them.  Lebron is more 6'8 rather than 6'9 and KD is more 7 feet rather than 6'11. You can also see KD next to Drummond and Deandre Jordan and see that he's taller than both too.  just another example https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CzuVsi8XEAAVKVm.jpg
PG Coby White   SG Wayne Ellington  SF Rodney Hood  PF Harry Giles   C DeAndre Jordan  idk really. the best I could do
"Seeing how what you received in the actual trade was Wes Matthew's (waived), Dennis Smith Jr (traded), DeAndre Jordan (left via FA), and 2 draft picks.    Really, all you have so far is Rose in the latter part of his career and two draft picks for a former all-star.  Congrats, you really did win the trade."
"Lets see... We gave up Dennis Smith Jr. (no longer on the Knicks), Deandre Jordan (no longer on the Knicks), Wes Matthews (No longer on the Knicks) and two FRP's that - despite what braindead Knicks fans believe, will not be in the lotto. We got KP, an All Star Player who is worth that 'haul' plus much more, and Tim Hardaway Jr. who has become a key contributor. Yeah I'd say we won the trade. Only delusional Knicks fans could see that and believe they won. But keep defending your shitty franchise, I kinda pity you guys."
"Right, that’s why I said Jarrett Allen before Deandre Jordan. It’s not like the Lakers have better centers than those two."
"Idk, I would put my money on healthy Lavert with Kyrie  and KD+ Jarrett Allen/Deandre Jordan over Lakers. That’s if the nets were fully healthy though."
"I don't put much stock into singular regular season games. But I do know that DeAndre Jordan can't contain Embiid, Giannis or Bam for an entire series."
"On the other hand... Bucks, Heat and Sixers fans should be very excited that a rookie can do this to DeAndre Jordan."
the DeAndre Jordan special
DeAndre Jordan picking up right where he left off with the worst +/- on the team.  I'm so sad that his exile is over.
He was playing against the corpse of DeAndre Jordan so I would hold off on the hype for now
dont know if you are doing the ringz ernie meme or you genuinely dont get that blake/deandre jordan/melo get massive respect from every fringe player
"Stoudemire was a soon to be free agent like Lebron, but he wanted a long-term max contract that most teams around the league didn't want to give him--including both Phoenix and Cleveland--because he was already 27. As a result, Phoenix was concerned Stoudemire would walk in free agency so they were shopping him.   &gt;Earlier, Stoudemire's agent Happy Walters told The Associated Press that it would make no sense for the Phoenix Suns not to trade Stoudemire only to see him walk away as a free agent at the end of the season.  &gt;Stoudemire also said ""the door is open"" for talks on a long-term contract with Phoenix.  &gt;""I can remain with this team another five years or I can be elsewhere another five years,"" he said. ""We're not sure what's going to happen, but my ultimate goal is to eventually contend for a championship and get the best out of our team.""  &gt;The Suns are not likely to want a contract that extends five years.  &gt;Stoudemire also could decide not to opt out of the contract and take the $17.7 million, becoming a free agent after one more season with Phoenix. No team probably would match that figure in any long-term deal.  Source: https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4922486  Trading Stoudemire for Hickson would have also brought the Suns down below the luxury tax. It's why they traded Shaq to the Cavs originally they were dumping salary at the time. And in that Shaq trade the Suns wanted Hickson but Gilbert refused.  &gt;The Cavs and Suns talked about Hickson in the O'Neal deal, but the Cavs wanted to keep him. So the Suns have a history of interest in Hickson. They also considered drafting him in 2008 but took Robin Lopez instead.  Source: https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2010/01/cleveland_cavaliers_and_phoeni_1.html  &gt;The Suns are believed to like Cavaliers forward J.J. Hickson, whom they considered drafting in 2008 and is currently having a breakout sophomore season. The Cavs, however, have been reluctant to include Hickson in trade talks.  Source: https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2010/02/cleveland_cavaliers_intensify.html  Gilbert's backup plan if Lebron left was building around JJ Hickson, so he wouldn't trade him. Getting Stoudemire who was also a soon-to-be free agent but probably not worth a long-term max deal also didn't interest Gilbert. So it didn't happen. Lebron left and the Cavs built around Hickson.  This scenario played out again in Lebron's last year in Cleveland the 2nd time around too. Lebron wanted the Cavs to trade the 8th pick for Deandre Jordan. Dan Gilbert refused because his plan was to build around the 8th pick (Colin Sexton) if Lebron leaves. Lebron left. The Cavs are building around Colin Sexton."
Tuned in late to see that DeAndre Jordan started and the Nets were at an 11 point deficit...here we go again...  I really thought it was over.
"He's shooting 48% on the season. Him shooting &lt; 50% when Dončić sits isn't that surprising. It's not like he's DeAndre Jordan and shooting 70% from the field.   I know this isn't exactly what you are talking about, you mean games they both play and Luka goes to the bench, but in the games Porziņģis has played without Luka entirely he's averaged 25 &amp; 15.5. Those are great numbers. Last year he averaged 27 and 12 in games Luka didn't play. He's shown he can lead this team without Luka.  Naturally his FG% will decrease when he doesn't have an MVP candidate feeding him the ball, spacing the floor and drawing defenders.   His passing has actually been pretty solid when Luka sits. Our ball movement is much much better without Luka. When Luka plays we have a very heliocentric offense that 100% revolves around Luka, for better or worse. His APG may not be super high, but he has decent vision and is good about keeping the ball moving. He's not a black hole offensively like Harrison Barnes was."
"Steph is averaging 5.5 points more than Harden on 4.4% higher TS%. That’s a massive difference.   Harden averages 6 more assists, but that has to be written off in the contexts of their seasons as Steph gets to pass to Oubre (52.8 TS%), Wiggins (56.8 TS%), Draymond (49.8 TS%), and Wiseman (55.2 TS%) while Harden gets to pass to Kyrie (61.9 TS%), Joe Harris (67.1 TS%), Jeff Green (62.2 TS%), Bruce Brown (58.5 TS%), DeAndre Jordan (75.1 TS%), Landry Shamet (57.6 TS%), and sometimes even Kevin Durant (66.5 TS%) and Blake Griffin (62.3 TS%).  Curry has easily been the best guard in the league this year."
"&gt;Nobody knew how good Marc Gasol would’ve been, he was basically a throw in  He won the MVP in La Liga that year.  You've zero idea what you are talking about.  &gt; Crittenton was solid but nothing spectacular at all   He was a prospect, who had just been drafted #19 overall.  Like I said.  &gt; First rounders don’t mean much for contending teams   Harden was just traded for them, among many other players.  &gt;It’s basically if Vucevic was traded to the Nets for Bruce Brown, DeAndre Jordan, two first rounders, and Reggie perry.   No, it's not like that at all -- and Orlando didn't get much more than that anyway,"
"Nobody knew how good Marc Gasol would’ve been, he was basically a throw in  Crittenton was solid but nothing spectacular at all, and his career blew up due to a multitude of things  First rounders don’t mean much for contending teams  Kwame sucked and actively held the team back when they had to play him for a couple games   It’s basically if Vucevic was traded to the Nets for Bruce Brown, DeAndre Jordan, two first rounders, and Reggie perry. That’s an awful deal for Orlando"
"Well technically LMA is gone now unfortunately...  Obviously not a star at this point, but when the guy who will replace his minutes is DeAndre Jordan, LMA may as well have still been a star."
Deandre Jordan. They still include him in the “big whatever” when people discuss the star power of our team and quite frankly DJ isn’t even a top 5 player on our team
Patrick Ewing and Deandre Jordan have the same amount of All-NBA nods and both played for the Knicks
"He's right to say that, he has way more of a case than his teammate no matter what Simmons and Doc ""Deandre Jordan should be DPOY"" Embiid say"
Andre Drummond and DeAndre Jordan would be perennial all-NBA players
There are entire threads where people try to make him sound like DeAndre Jordan on offense lol
"It’s probably not in the best interest of anyone for him to do anything but rebound and play defense. On shit rosters he might have done a bit more offensively, but Drummond being someone’s number one option was never going to be anyone’s key to success. Has he ever even had a point guard? Like a halfway decent one at least?  He just needs to rebound and play defense and have someone get him easy baskets. Shit basketball teams had him trying to be some 20 and 10 center and I’m not sure he was meant to be that. It’s like if someone took the Clippers version of Deandre Jordan and asked him to be the star player of the Bobcats or something. Y’all would have thought he sucked too."
"Don't think they need another big, Deandre Jordan was out of the rotation after Aldridge signed, I'd imagine they will just put him back in the rotation now.  He is better than the current free agent options."
DeAndre Jordan low key had a really good game against us. Like I was surprised how good he was and he even did a decent job defending Embiid lol.
"Yeah, this is going to be tough for them. He was like their only big aside from DeAndre Jordan.  I feel like Giannis and Embiid are going to feast against the Nets front court."
DeAndre Jordan? All NBA? wtf is this post lmao
"Aldridge wasn't great at this point, but DeAndre Jordan playing the 5 for you is still a tough pill for a contender to swallow."
Deandre Jordan is barely a serviceable back up at this point.
&gt; and be replaced by another all nba center  Oh who did they sign?  &gt; DeAndre Jordan  Get out of here with that crap
"I’m a big believer that most rumored trades are that .. just rumors. False stuff getting leaked to make teams either look more desperate or to make it look like a team tried when they didn’t really. At the end of the day I try to tell myself if a rumored trade that didn’t go through has me thinking, “why wouldn’t they accept that?” I tend to tell myself it probably was never on the table. That being said some that come to mind -  - Kyrie to the Wolves for Andrew Wiggins. This was right after the Wolves got Jimmy. I actually think Kyrie and Jimmy would of been a really good back court, especially with KAT as a pick and roll big with a great low post presence. I don’t think the Wolves were ready to give up on Wiggs yet at the time though.  - Jimmy for 4 first round picks to the Wolves. I feel like this one wasn’t all that it was cracked up to be. They only leaked that the Wolves turned down 4 first rounders but not the potential protections the Rockets might of put on them. That being said Jimmy with that specific Rockets team might of been enough to get them past the Warriors.  - Lakers trading Dwight Howard to the Clippers for Blake Griffen and DeAndre Jordan. This one was really wild for me. I remember thinking there was no possible way this was on the table because it seemed like the Lakers were fleecing the Clippers but I remember watching them tear apart the Lakers on First Take for not accepting the offer the minute it was sent TO THEM and talking as if there were already legit talks between the teams about the trade. That being said idk how reliable Skip and Stephen A are when they report on stuff so I still think it might of not been true. Would of been wild though."
Deandre Jordan in shambles.
He's averaging 11 assists per game this season. I used to think he was a Trae Young type player but this year having watched him his assists are his highest value to the nets. Making even deandre jordan look like a shadow of his former self at least.
Oh damn did not know that. Tho he was a center so he only had to compete against deandre jordan and rudy gobert lol.
"I mean Kyrie just dropped 37 pts and 9 asts starting alongside Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, and Landry Shamet....Phil;y cant guard any of these guys"
Putting DeAndre Jordan to guard embiid is so unfair lol
He’s also out-rebounding him 12-6. Very weird to see Embiid getting clamped by DeAndre Jordan and Steven Adams
"Yeah, JoJo rimmed out a few midranges. The thing is - DeAndre is unable to raise his hands up to contest shots so if that midrange falls - Jordan is not an answer at all."
"Nobody is going to “stop” Embiid.  A prime Gasol or Bogut could, but nobody out there right now.  That doesn’t mean Jarrett Allen wouldn’t do a much better job than the corpse of DeAndre Jordan or Nic Claxton."
"Kyrie 5/6 in the 1st with Ben and Thybulle on him.  Joel 3/9 with a ""washed up"" Deandre Jordan on him.  Nets shot 60% in the 1st and that's w/o KD and Harden."
"Deandre Jordan has surprisingly been decent so far, bothering Embiid in the paint. Embiid will not be knocking those down all night unless he just having one of those nights, so it is what it is"
DEANDRE JORDAN WANTS HIS MINUTES BACK
"""and DeAndre Jordan is back in it to counter Joel Embiid"" yo that might be one of the funniest sentences ive ever seen in this sub lmao"
" Yeah, Obi Toppin pretty much did 2 things for the first half of the season, either spotting up from the corner or flashing out above the arc in a double staggered ball screen. Neither are really his strengths, so he hasn't been used the right way this season. If we actually played him like a John Collins, DeAndre Jordan, or just about any other actual athletic rim runner, he'd be dropping jaws with how often he exerts his physicality over others. But right now, Thibs is using him like a spot up shooter."
"With DeAndre Jordan, the clippers are one of the franchises in history"
Making DeAndre Jordan an All-NBA 1st team is the biggest achievement of his career
"Oh I agree regarding Stotts. His offense was laughably basic. And you’re right about those guys but those teams had super athletic screen setters/roll men and one of the best passers ever in Harden.   And besides, the high pick is the basis of nearly all modern offense. Jones isn’t setting effective screens so he can’t be in that role and back door lobs are trick plays or side dishes, not substantive parts of an offense. I should have been more specific when I mentioned lobs but DJJ is obviously not deandre Jordan or Clint capela lol"
"I remember they sent Deandre Jordan, can't remember the rest. NY was mostly trying to get cap space to sign Kyrie/KD."
"Forget KP. If you told me we traded Dennis Smith, Deandre Jordan, and whoever else we traded for just THJ, I'd tell you we won the trade."
Knicks really gave us KP AND Timmy for Deandre Jordan who plays 10 minutes away and DSJ who’s probably in the G League next year.
"If Deandre Jordan returns, Likely Blake will be returning to playing the small ball 4, where he actually was pretty decent atleast when I watched the Nets he was alright   He played starting 5 against Boston which is not a good spot for him at all."
Pretty sure Deandre jordan isn’t starting
CP3 and the Clippers had Deandre Jordan looking like god amongst men and boy did that work on me
"All-NBA for centers has been pretty underwhelming recently. It’s getting a little better with Gobert, Embiid, and Jokic. Let’s not forget that DeAndre Jordan was First Team All-NBA fairly recently."
"They wouldn't dare to simply use Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan and Nick Claxton to guard him, and we're getting robbed of Joel Embiid potentially killing all three men. maybe we'll see Jokic show them why they need a center."
"LeBron, Carmelo, Bosh, and Wade were all drafted in 2003 and all will be in the HOF.   1996 had Iverson, Ray Allen, Kobe, Steve Nash plus Marbury, Peja, and Jermaine O'Neal (plus an undrafted Ben Wallace). Five Hall of Famers that year.   1985 had Ewing, Mullin, Malone, Dumars, plus Oakley, X-Man, AC Green, Terry Porter, and Sabonis (first time).   1984 was Olajuwon, Jordan, Barkley and Stockton.   Anyway, I'm mad at DeAndre Ayton now."
"I still remember at the begining of the season Ayton roll into CP3 and ruined the play. Now Ayton is setting Tyson Chandler, Deandre Jordan level screen. Your team is something special. I hope you guys can make a very deep playoff run."
Yeah no big deal. Jordan wasn't that good /s I must've been watching Deandre Jordan not Michael cause that guy says I've never seen him.
DeAndre Jordan tho
"DeAndre Jordan was once all NBA first team and leading the league in blocks per game. Don't forget they had LaMarcus Aldridge, too."
"Nets with big 3, plus prime Blake and Deandre Jordan"
they're gonna take the 12 million and get fucking uhhhhhh DeAndre Jordan or Thad Young
He needs to be a DeAndre Jordan. Screen hard multiple times per possession like a madman.   None of this on-ball BS.
Please please justify your thinking that Deandre Jordan is the best defender on the Nets.
"The mavs had Kleiber, Deandre Jordan, Harrison Barnes, trey Burke, and Tim hardaway Luka’s rookie year. The hawks had JC and who?"
Imma get downvoted but I'm thinking Bucks in 6. They led the league in scoring this season. Brooklyn's best defender is DeAndre Jordan. Jrue is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league. Last time they met up Kyrie wasn't even allowed to play the game.
I wonder if Doc has any added insight into how to coach a bad freethrow shooter since he had DeAndre Jordan for all those years.
"I dont mind FAs. As much as I hated Hayward leaving Utah, i didnt feel quite as bad about the Celtics building the roster they had.  But I mean come on, the Lakers were giving out notoriously bad contracts and had Luke Walton as the coach. The only thing that attracted free agents was the city.   And when does what the nets did ever happen? 3 superstars with no ties to the city that just need a place with cap space to land. Can you imagine if DeAndre Jordan was still near all star level? The only thing comparable is the decision but at least DWade was already there.   I still think the Lakers FO is horrible too. They get Lebron, they get AD, they still have cap space to build an exceptional supporting cast, and instead they wait on another star who doesnt want to go there and have to overpay Danny Green for one season. Now they're relying on Drummond to be an actual decent player with AD out and it's all blowing up."
"What about the Grizzlies? What about the Pacers? What about the Spurs? Super competently run organizations that had close to a decade of success and have survived their teams getting blown up and quickly returning to the playoffs. You think they had any kind of chance to land KD, Kyrie or Lebron or AD? Fuck no.  One comes before the other. It’s a big market. THEN, it’s about the org. And, they got rid of all those players and fired the coach anyway. It’s not like the team resembles anything Marks was building before. They didn’t give a shit about that, they found out he wasn’t an idiot and made him clean house so they could install their friends like Steve Nash, D’Antoni, Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green and Harden to win easy rings in a big city."
Deandre Jordan comes with the package
"I bet after James Harden and Blake Griffon flew in to join him, Kyrie Irving, Deandre Jordan and Joe Harris he thought to himself “finally, a decent middle of the pack team”"
When did DeAndre Jordan play for the Knicks
"Never forget when Nets fans and Lakers fans tried to convince the world that the buyout market was rigged for the other team and Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan were secretly going to return to their primes for whichever team they didn't like"
Drummond swings from being a crucial player to a pure negative to the Lakers back and forth. Blake just is consistently not good. Neither player has been an overall positive for each team but the Nets probably are okay with the consistently not good player considering the firepower they have whereas the Lakers are banged up enough where they need the Drummond peaks. I might say Blake was the better buyout by a tiny bit because I think Gasol is more useful of a replacement than DeAndre Jordan but neither is worth getting upset over.
Curious why is deandre jordan not playing any minutes?
"Like him better as a small ball 4. Putting him at the 5 is putting him out of place a bit. I much prefer green or matter a fact, Deandre Jordan was decent against Tristan Thompson throughout the Regular season matchups"
DeAndre Jordan is not much of a player anymore
"Spoken like someone who hasn't watched DeAndre Jordan this year   He's washed, though he might play against the Bucks since they have more size to deal with than the Celtics"
 You're missing the whole Finals MVP point that I made. Russell would have at least 8 of those and Wilt would have 2. We use those to give MJ credit but for Russell somehow they wouldn't count? The All-Defense stuff is also useless for comparison considering they started giving it out literally on the last year of Russell's career. So if we had All-Defensive teams and DPOYs in his prime he would have had the opportunity to collect a lot more of those. This is why historical context is so important when blindly comparing accolades.   Scoring and rebounding titles don't mean much to me in terms of legacy because they're based simply on volume. Guys like Bob McAdoo and Adrian Dantley won multiple scoring titles and they're not top 50 guys. DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond both have multiple rebounding titles and they're not top 100 guys. Dwight has 5 of those and I think we can both agree he wasn't as great as his numbers.
Deandre Jordan making 1st team All NBA needs to be on CP3’s HOF resume
The basketball-reference ORtg absolutely loves guys like DeAndre Jordan and Tyson Chandler who shoot a super high percentage (on all layups and dunks). It's really not a meaningful stat.
"Great defence at the 5 will always be valuable. Clint doesn’t try to be anything that he’s not, like Deandre Jordan on the Clippers"
"I mean there are fundamental skills beyond just saying ""dribbling"" and ""putting ball in hoop.""  Hook shot, elbow rip, crossover, jumpshot, jab step, spin move, pro hop, layup, reverse layup, box out, screen setting, power dribble, bounce pass, and drop steps are all fundamental skills, very few elite players are not adept at literally all of these, sans paint towers like Gobert/Drummond/DeAndre Jordan/etc. Zion for example is good at all of them (not NBA tier jumpshot, but elite at everything else, and would rain jumpers on poorer defense.) Ja is incredible at all of them as well. Blake and Embiid are other examples of generally excellent fundamentals.   Kobe and Duncan are two players who mastered all of the fundamentals. An example of a good player who hasn't mastered all the fundamentals is Durant (who is still obviously insanely good.)"
He’ll probably be fine on the free throw front. The chance that he’s actually turned into a DeAndre Jordan level free throw shooter is very low. The real concern is that he’s only a good offensive player in transition. He’s absolutely pathetic in the half court for a player on his level of clout and recognition and there are no other high level perimeter ball handlers on the roster. The Sixers are fucked in terms of title contention for as long as that’s the case.
Doc had the exact same rule for DeAndre Jordan during the lob city years when teams were Hacking-a-Jordan. DJ just had to make one out of two to avoid being benched.
"You're still not getting it.  I am not saying Ayton is outrageously skilled at all.  Quite the opposite.    &gt;You guys have only won games Booker has done well in. Aytons performance means nothing to ur teams success.   Game 4 says otherwise.  And you might have missed Ayton's 17 boards, made partly possible by Davis being out.  &gt;And I find it funny that you brought up that he shot 80%. Insinuating that Ayton creates his own shot. It would be like bringing up that DeAndre Jordan shoots 70%.  When did I insinuate that?  I am simply saying that even if you get past the Suns and their raw center (which would be largely due to CP3's injury just like AD's injury would be largely the reason we would win), Denver would eat you for breakfast because Jokic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ayton.  Notice they are actually shooting well, unlike us.  You don't have anybody who can limit the MVP especially with AD gone, and they have actually been shooting well, unlike the Suns."
Yes the Lakers are ok with that.  Because Booker is shooting 40%. I would mention Paul's numbers but he was injured. If Ayton gets open dunks its not a concern at all. If Booker goes off. It is.  You guys have only won games Booker has done well in. Aytons performance means nothing to ur teams success.   And I find it funny that you brought up that he shot 80%.  Insinuating that Ayton creates his own shot. It would be like bringing up that DeAndre Jordan shoots 70%.
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
"He pressures the hell out of the rim on pick and roll in a way not many ever have, that I can recall.  Capela, prime DeAndre Jordan, and young Amare are the closest I can think of"
I’d rather take Deandre Jordan taking a 3
They hacking my boy like he’s Deandre Jordan 😭
"this would be convincing if you didnt watch basketball during this time but for those who did, including my self, understand context and how horrible the center position was for the mid 2010s. There is a reason deandre jordan was 1st team all nba twice."
Kenny is Brandon Knight trying to block Deandre Jordan.
He’s not a great shooter but he’s shooting FTs like he’s DeAndre Jordan. He’s not *that* bad.
"oh yeah, absolutely, thats why if he was still playing, that buyouts would be illegal energy would be louder, but since he retired and blake griffin is playing like crap, thats definitely subsided  also, speaking of which, the nets roster reads like an all star team lol, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan. That's an all star team from 2-3 years ago hahaha"
Is deandre jordan hurt?
"lets see that blake griffin alley oop to deandre jordan, lob city forever"
i just realized blake griffin and deandre jordan are on the same team again
DeAndre Jordan was an athletic big who was always an Ironman.
can we see some deandre jordan this game in garbage time
Deandre Jordan would probably kill him
where's deandre jordan?
"These dudes dumb as shit. Nets defense is legitimately suspect as fuck and the Sixers have got the personnel to exploit areas of major weakness.  Celtics without their 2nd best player taking a game off the Nets despite incredible performances by KD and Harden should be an obvious indicator to anyone.  Meanwhile the Bucks just curbstomped the Heat and are looking like a total buzzsaw. I'd take Bucks over Sixers and Nets, and if I'm the Sixers I'd like my chances having my best player matched up against Deandre Jordan/ Blake Griffin than a front court of Brook Lopez &amp; Giannis."
DeAndre Jordan is literally had the most efficient 2pt shooting season and didn't even hit 70% by over 2%. And no the guys in 3x3 aren't the most dominant interior big men of all time because all they have to do is shoot 3pts at slightly below league average to be a more effective player than DeAndre Jordan. The value of a shot behind the arc is just worth too much in 1s and 2s to not take it unless you have a wide open dunk.
They said 70% inside the arc. Guys like DeAndre Jordan have achieved that.
That DeAndre Jordan lob city shot chart.
"Yeahhh I am not so sure of that, but I think we exposed two things last game:  - Kyrie is a liability in PNR if they are going to switch everything. In general I think their defensive scheme is a mess/nonexistent, and if you don't turn the ball over I don't think they can stop shit.   - They have no rim protection. I don't follow the Nets closely enough to know if DeAndre Jordan is totally washed or what, but Blake Griffin and Claxton can't cut it defensively. They can grab some rebounds but neither offers much inside of the perimeter.   Tatum was god tier so it didn't really matter what they were trying to do defensively anyways, but if you can get in the paint against them I think they are kind of exposed. Clearly the issue is then keeping them in check offensively, but we got Harris in foul trouble and Kyrie is a mental midget, so Harden and KD going for 80 didn't win them the game. I think today could be interesting but the Celtics have been atrocious guarding the perimeter all year, it's really hard to be too confident."
"How about when it's Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Nic Claxton?"
Deandre Jordan was a 39% FT shooter that season.
Of course you hug him lol. Do you not remember Deandre Jordan vs Houston?
Guys like Deandre Jordan has high efg numbers because efg counts layups and dunks too.
Except his defense isn't so great. Deandre Jordan in Lob City is what you envision
Holy shit I completely forgot about Deandre Jordan!  I don't think I ever even saw him on a cut-away to the bench.
He got that DeAndre Jordan lob city shot chart this series.
And they're paying DeAndre Jordan 10m/y to sit and watch it happen.
Seems like the Nets could use Deandre Jordan
Is Deandre Jordan injured or something?
"Didn’t the Nets start off with Deandre Jordan, when KD and Kyrie signed?  What happened to him?"
What’s is DeAndre Jordan?
We have Deandre Jordan....
genuine question: is deandre jordan injured or just not getting minutes? havent been paying a ton of attention to this series but it feels like i havent seen him play
DeAndre Jordan rolling in his grave
Is Nash going to play deandre Jordan?
Congratulations! You are now building around a 6’9 DeAndre jordan with a 170 million dollar contract. Your team will never be good again.
"He's the biggest body in the rotation right now, offering better post up defense than Griffin and Claxton...I mean DeAndre Jordan is still on the roster, but idk if staring menacingly at shooters counts as defense lol"
My favorite moment in that series was [Hayward dunking on DeAndre Jordan](https://youtu.be/UltgFVBVLcc)
"They never should've hired him in the first place.  He is a first year coach dealing with massive egos and running that horrible ""Sun's Offense"" that he could never win a championship with at  PG even with Joe Johnson, Amare Stoudamire, etc...all in their prime.  They need a coach who can call plays not just run a ""one on one"" style of basketball.  Durant's heave at the end of the game was a pathetic shot choice and clearly nothing but isolation was called. Also,  DeAndre Jordan still had enough to contribute...why they played him most of the season then stopped come playoff time against a much larger team is beyond me...he can give you six fouls at the lease, but also go 5-5, snatch 12 rebounds, and 3 blocks...They cannot continue with Nash next season!!"
I didn't think Blake fouling out would be the deciding factor for the Nets this postseason.   DeAndre Jordan is truly washed. I wonder how much positive chemistry he provides off court to be worth that contract.
Bruce Brown played 52 minutes of -7 basketball tonight while Mike James and DeAndre Jordan played a combined 0:00.
His ball handling is no where near elite. Unless you compare him to bigs.   Giannis athleticism is unique. He’s no Deandre Jordan or Dwight.  He has the foot speed and coordination/ body control of a small forward at 7ft.   He’s a 7ft Westbrook but with dpoy defensive iq and instincts.
If they aren’t stupid as bricks they trade DeAndre Jordan and tell Kyrie and KD that a player who can’t play in the postseason can’t be taking up this much money   Trade him for anyone who can see the floor in the playoffs
"Harden at least was able to play as a decoy, could still draw fouls and acted as a facilitator. People move the goal posts on LeBron so often that it almost underrates him.   That 06-07 Cavs team:  LeBron (22 years old) Big Z Anderson Verajao Drew Gooden Daniel Gibson Sasha Pavlovic Eric Snow Ira Newble  20-21 Brooklyn KD Harden Kyrie (yes, he played in 2.5 games) Jeff Green Blake Griffin Joe Harris Brown DeAndre Jordan (IDK why he didn’t get any run)  You can’t **possibly** tell me that these teams are in any way comparable. KD and LeBron, maybe they’re a wash, but KD is 10 years LeBron’s senior on this series. So you trade athleticism for experience.  A hurt Harden is better than anyone else on those Cavs. 2.5 games of Kyrie is better than anyone on those Cavs. Jeff Green is better and more complementary than anyone of those Cavs. Blake Griffin at this age is better than anyone of those Cavs. Joe Harris is a 48% regular season 3PT shooter. Him choking in this series has not merit on the fact that if current him was on that Cavs team, he would have been an asset.  And no disrespect to KD, he was masterful this series. But LeBron’s Cavs **won** against a team that had been the ECF champions for several consecutive seasons."
Lot of players with the extra 2 letters in their names lmao  DeMarcus Cousins  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De'Andre Hunter  DeAndre' Bembry  Devonte' Graham  De'Aaron Fox  LaMelo Ball  LaMarcus Aldridge  LeBron James  probably more I don't know
DeAndre Jordan
Well looks like DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin won’t be appearing in the Finals
"Although I'm not a fan of the Nets, it really sucked to see them get so many injuries just as basketball fan.    I looked at the Nets salary this year. With the injuries to Harden, Kyrie, and Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan being MIA. They played games this series, with KD, Harris, and about 10 million in combined salary for the rest of the players. They did well considering."
"Yeah I looked at the Nets salary this year. With the injuries to Harden, Kyrie, and Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan being MIA. They played games this series, with KD, Harris, and about 10 million in combined salary for the rest of the players. They did well considering."
"I honestly forgot they had DeAndre jordan, I'm guessing they move on from him and try to re sign blake."
Idk why I forgot deandre Jordan was on the nets and played with Blake before wtf
When was the last time deandre jordan played? Feels like centuries
I'm just glad deandre jordan wont get carried to a chip.
How useless is DeAndre Jordan is if he can't get mintues agaisnt one of the tallest teams is the league? That man is washed
Chris Paul having flashbacks to clippers DeAndre Jordan right now
DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin can't win with these dudes. Time to trade KD-Harden-Kyrie for CP3 + filler.
I tag in Deandre Jordan.
I forgot DeAndre Jordan was on the Nets lmao
"As someone who didn’t get into the NBA outside the bulls until like April this season, wtf happened to Deandre Jordan?"
Nets are gonna lose the game because Steve Nash doesn’t even consider the importance of DeAndre Jordan 👎👎👎👎👎
DeAndre Jordan will suck KD and Kyrie for that fat contract
deandre jordan really got a fat ass contract for being friends with kd and kyrie lol. sometimes life is just too easy for some people.
DeAndre Jordan having more Game 7 experience than anyone else in this game is hilarious
"As for myself, I'm from Australia. In 2012 I got to visit the States and managed to go to one NBA game while I was in LA. I got to see LAC vs OKC. I loosely followed the NBA a couple years before that but that was the day I decided to pick a team. Thought it'd be rude not to go for the home team.   I got to see Blake, CP3, DeAndre Jordan vs KD, James Harden and Russel Westbrook. This happened to be the game when Blake did his infamous dunk on Perkins.   Been a die-hard fan ever since and I could probably count the number of LAC games I haven't watched on my hands since then."
"I felt Gobert could’ve been a lot better defensively.   But he needs to spend the entire offseason working on his goddamn hands. He has the hands of Chandler Bing. For all the shit DeAndre Jordan had, if the ball was given to him, he would 100% catch it. Gobert’s inability it to catch and handle the ball ruins so many points and assists chances."
"No you're definitely right, he's rules in the past but he isn't a pick and roll center. That's more of a DeAndre Jordan or Clint Capella type center."
Isn’t that the same with DeAndres in the NBA?  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De’Andre Hunter  DeAndre’ Bembry  I could be missing someone but I think those are the only current 4
"You could have Lob City back with DeAndre Jordan, Griffin, and CP3 in a Nets v Suns finals. Weird for sure."
He takes 77% of shots within 3 feet. That's the most insane shot chart I have ever seen. Even lob city DeAndre Jordan didn't have a shot chart like that. He obviously has an extremely limited skill set.   What does feed Gobert mean in the context of teams switching his pick and rolls?
"Doc Rivers had CP3, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan,  JJ Redick (led the league in 3pt %) , Jamal Crawford (6th man of the year)"
"No, he's a clearly better player then DeAndre Jordan ever was. Your hate googles need to be taken off if you honestly believe that."
"This is the way.  CP3/Suns beat LBJ, Paul’s friend and peer  CP3/Suns beats Clippers, franchise that sided with Blake and Deandre’s relaxed attitudes and work ethic over Paul’s fiery competitive nature  CP3/Suns beats Nets super team, taking out Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, and James Harden. All of whom grew to dislike Paul for imploring them to dedicate all of themselves to their craft rather than half-assing their careers due to off court distractions.  This is the way.  CP3 redemption tour."
Imagine if the Nets were healthy and replaced DeAndre Jordan with Prime Hakeem Olajuwon. Would they win in 4 or 5?
How does gobert not have at least a hook or one move?  He's gotta be the least skilled player in the game behind DeAndre Jordan
"Trade Gobert for DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris and Landry Shamet."
He's french DeAndre Jordan
And now we face Chris Paul then very hypothetically at this point Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan (and Landry Shamet).  What a narrative that would be
Man...  Danny Manning didn't get there.  Ron Harper didn't get there.  Loy Vaught didn't get there.  Eric Piatkowski didn't get there.  Darius Miles didn't get there.  Quentin Richardson didn't get there.  Elton Brand didn't get there.  Sam Cassell didn't get there.  Blake Griffin didn't get there.  Chris Paul didn't get there.  DeAndre Jordan didn't get there.  Doc Rivers didn't get there.  Danilo Gallinari didn't get there.  Tobias Harris didn't get there.  But we finally got there. WE FINALLY MADE IT.
"Thought to post this while the thread was young, but fuck me, yall are fast, so im gonna piggy back here.  First it was the lob city era. Cp3+blake with deandre jordan to add to it. Didnt work. 2nd round exits. Then jamal crawford wins like 3 6MOY'S, they bolster their bench more, doesnt work. 2nd round exits. Then they blow it up, bring 2 superstars in kawhi and PG. Doesnt work! 2nd round exit again!   And then, in 2021, clippers are a 4 seed playing vs the utah jazz who had the best regular season record. Then, catastrophe strikes, and your best player goes out with an injury. Surely, its another 2nd round exit.   NOPE! After everything, so many star combinations over the years, this fucking kid Terrance Mann, a 2nd year player comes in, and scores 40 on em! Western conference finalists!  These types of scenarios is why i fell in love with sports. Congrats clippers"
He did that on the Clippers by benching Deandre Jordan too. The man has his flaws but he’s always had the balls to make decisions like those that few other NBA coaches would
"The Mavs FO was sub-mediocre long time before Luka.  They almost wasted all of Dirk's career before putting a decent supporting cast around him, which resulted in an instant win. Dirk's weaknesses, obvious to anyone watching ball, were defense, rebounding and playmaking. He was an absolute elite scorer, but there were holes that needed to be plugged. I was saying Dirk needs someone like Chandler next to him since 2005 or 2006. I specifically mentioned Chandler. And for playmakers, it'd be hard to do better than Kidd, even an older Kidd.   Let's not forget that in order to help cover Dirk's poor D, the Mavs also got Shawn Marion and DeShawn ""I can't feel my face"" Stevenson.  That was the one and only well assembled Mavs roster in over 20 years. The only one where the pieces fit.   All the other moves (done or attempted) by the Mavs over that period were major flops:  * Dampier was a disaster, and they have up Nash for him * the attempted pairing of Dwight and Deron would have flamed out, considering how they fell off, especially Deron * DeAndre Jordan would have been a massively overpaid role player unable to fill in the same role as Chandler * speaking of Chandler, Chandler Parsons * Rondo - the move didn't make sense to me at the time, and it went even worse than I expected. I would have kept Crowder * Harrison Barnes  They also kept Avery Johnson as coach for way too long. Dude was clearly a poor coach.  **It's irrelevant how much of a diva/hothead Luka is, the Mavs FO underperformed for over 2 decades and should have been replaced long ago.**"
Probably not even close. Shaq and Deandre Jordan have missed 20 in playoff games by themselves.
"Absolutely, it was a steal at the time. People act like it was a mistake to trade DeAndre Jordan, DSJ and Wes Mathews for Porzingas and THJ. That is still a great trade if they only got THJ back. The Porzingas contract sucks in retrospect but I don't see any moves where their logic was wrong."
Deandre jordan.
"The 2016 Warriors were, at absolute worst, the fifth best offensive team of all time. You have to be completely delusional to think that the Nets are ""far above"". Even if they are better, which is a reasonable take, it's by a microscopic amount.  I'm also not sure what drugs it takes to think that I'm saying that KD is a bad defender. The Nets are a bad defensive team and KD is nowhere near good enough at that end to cover for the gaping holes provided by Kyrie, Harris and DeAndre Jordan.  The Warriors were the best team in the history of the NBA and the Nets just aren't better. They're not far behind, they're also one of the best ever, but there is no way you can actually think they're significantly better."
"On a scale of 1 to deandre jordan vs brandon knight, how disrespectful is this dunk?"
Brandon Knight and DeAndre Jordan
i haven't seen a dunk that disrespectful since deandre jordan on brandon knight
I’m convinced him and deandre Jordan aren’t left handed and are just too stubborn at this point.   JJ talked about DJ on his podcast one time. He does everything right handed expect shoot fts

"Honestly, if DeAndre Jordan can improve his free throw shooting, I see no reason why Simmons can't"
Before or after the DeAndre Jordan full-court 3?
There’s a Marc Cuban Deandre Jordan joke somewhere in here.  Edit: Found one! It was okay
"DeAndre Jordan was in the mix for like a day, then later we got him for real for half a season as trade bait, soooo...."
Almost DeAndre Jordan
Correct me if im wrong but didnt deandre jordan did sign with Mavericks when he was a free agent
DeAndre Jordan made perfect sense this series. Yet here we are.
"it's completely mental. i remember DeAndre Jordan used to be cancer at the line, until he added a little ritual: after getting the ball, he'd chat up a teammate with a question, then shoot. the short convo would help him relax, i guess. he shot 10% better from the line with DAL that season."
Oh shit I forgot Deandre Jordan existed. Why hasn’t he played?
"oh yea, Deandre Jordan is on that nets team, who knew"
"15 vs 6 ofensive rebounds   I don't get why DeAndre Jordan doesn't get any minutes, he's good rebounder and rim protector, just the thing Nets need"
How useless is DeAndre Jordan? Did he retire?
Free DeAndre Jordan
Is DeAndre Jordan injured or just that bad? He'd look like a decent rim protector vs Giannis?
So glad I get to watch DeAndre Jordan instead of a replay...
Still making short work of the Nets' inside D. Told him to speed up his free throws btw and guy is taking the piss. Every game he is slower than the one before. He is so deep in his thoughts. Guy was a 77% FT shooter just a few years ago and rn he is DeAndre Jordan from the line.
I can’t believe Deandre Jordan doesn’t exist anymore
Is DeAndre Jordan hurt or something?
"You just proved my point. CP3 has that effect on teammates, he raises there level of play. He made guys like Tyson Chandler, David West, DeAndre Jordan look like all stars. Like I said his main downside is that he always gets injured at the worst possible time, combination of bad luck and his body not being able to handle the playoffs."
He is very ESPN-ish. Very on brand.   I won't forget how he tried to make Deandre Jordan stealing an offensive rebound from Luka a thing.
"&gt; I can’t even name any notable free agent signings  They tried to get DeAndre Jordan, Deron Williams, and Chris Bosh I think?   Can't say it wasn't a lack of trying."
you mean like deandre jordan ;)
Deandre Jordan was the last time so many people were driving around upset and texting
Not that I think the results would change _too_ much but this should really be using EFG% instead of FG%. If Tristan Thompson is the _closest_ defender on anyone when they take a shot its most likely they will be near the rim where FG% is naturally higher. Conversely if a wing defender is guarding someone and they are the _closest_ defender there's a much higher chance it will be a midrange or 3pt shot (compared to someone like Deandre Jordan) so the FG% will naturally be lower.
"Full disclosure, I'm a 20yr+ Clipper fan:   I know Doc has only been there 1 year but this is what he did to Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, limit them to the few things they were good at and never develop any other part of their game."
"well, deandre jordan hasn't played a single second in the playoffs, so it's not like he's really on the team... and blake has been 7/10 FT so far.  he's not being made to shoot many at all."
Didn’t Deandre Jordan or Dwight Howard start doing this? Increased their FT % significantly if I remember. It was a way of relaxing and getting your mind off the pressure.
&gt; The Matthews deal was done as a favour for Wes after DeAndre Jordan got cold feet and backed out.   That's not effective front office work. Just like signing players cause they're nice guys isn't good front office work.
Never Thought a team with blake and deandre jordan would be the best free throw shooting team in the nba
Real DeAndre Jordan on the Clippers vibes
"The Matthews deal was done as a favour for Wes after DeAndre Jordan got cold feet and backed out.   I think people give the Mavs FO too much shit for the twilight years of Dirk. I will admit that blowing up the 2011 team and giving up on Chandler twice were mistakes, but otherwise I believe that the Mavs did a fine job. They were never going to be contenders past ~2013, Dirk was getting too old and Dallas didn't have assets and whiffed in FA."
Players with a better DFG% at the rim than the 61.8% Adams had:   * Wiseman * Drummond * KAT * Mo Bamba * Montrezl * Sabonis * Tristan Thompson * DeAndre Jordan * Olynyk * Baynes * Markkanen * Boucher
"Honestly, I'm not sure I'd give Donnie that much of a positive assessment.    He's hired in 2005 (shoutout to that weird Haralabob burner account for giving me that date), helps sustain our early-aughts 50-win team success. Eventually culminates in building the 2011 team. Sure, credit there. That team was great, got Dirk a ring.    Since then? Blew up the championship team (allegedly Cuban's call), whiffed on Dwight, Deron Williams, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, others. We've had OJ Mayo, Darren Collison, the god awful Chandler Parsons deal, the god awful Porzingis extension, dumping Jae Crowder (who I always thought was underused in Carlisle's rotations), on and on.    I've been frustrated with Donnie for a while. I think it's time for some new blood. Get Haraladingus out of there too."
"Incredible, DeAndre Jordan really got 40 million just for being friends with these 2"
Prediction: Nets win the ECF without Kyrie and Harden. Durant and his scrubs face a healthy Suns team in the finals. Steve Nash signs himself as a free agent- to prevent DeAndre Jordan from playing. The Nash/Durant lineup beats the Suns in 6- Kyrie points out that he called it. The Nets didn’t need a coach. The Suns can’t believe Nash costs them another title.
"I mean, DeAndre Jordan is clearly the exception though right? Like, Shaq, Wilt, Dwight, Ben Wallace, and other historically bad free throw shooters surely tried to ""put the work in"" and couldn't surmount it.  Obviously Ben is more of a %60 FT shooter than a %30 shooter and he's going through an insane nightmare-fucked-mentality thing, which utterly sucks. But even that aside his biomechanics are just not good, and I think it would be a lot more impressive if he managed to pull a DeAndre Jordan than it would be shocking for him to stay a ~%60 shooter.  He was at %67 before the All-Star break, which does give some hope for improvement. Since then it's just been terrible though. I don't understand what's been going on since then."
"He deserves coaching jobs in this league. He's gotten career years out of Tobias both on the Clippers and Sixers, turned DeAndre Jordan from a raw athletic rim runner to a DPOY candidate and 1st team all NBA center, and he's a players coach. Most players seem to enjoy playing for him right up until the postseason.   But he doesn't need to be anywhere near a team with actual championship aspirations"
If DeAndre Jordan can go from 47% to 73% ft so can Ben.  He is a fucking professional basketball player making hundreds of millions of dollars to play with balls   Improving mentally and biomechanics take time and repetition but you gotta put the work in.
"Durant got what looks like a full max.  Kyrie took a \~500,000 pay cut to fit DeAndre Jordan in at 10M.  Originally what was reported didn't come to fruition.  The Nets were able to order their transactions, use like/unlikely bonus clauses (for Kyrie and Durant) and an unforeseen Durant/DLO sign-and-trade to create space for DeAndre's 10M deal."
15-16 cause of the great DeAndre Jordan heist
"Man, if you thought that, than it must have been tough for you to be on this sub if you were here when DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond were making the All Star team.  Back then, there were some very vocal Pistons/Clippers fans who used to argue that making FTs required no basketball skill and the FT should be removed from the game lol."
"*a couple years ago* Kyrie: “Hey wanna play together?” KD: “Sure” DeAndre Jordan: “I’m in!” Kyrie &amp; KD: “…? Fine, whatever.”"
The regular season Nets were playing DeAndre Jordan and were a bottom 10 defense. These Nets are a top 2 defence on the playoffs.  Scoring 30 against a top 2 defense one the playoffs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Over averaging 40 on a bottom 10 defense in the regular season.   The rest of his team is shooting 48% TS in this series. The Nets are clamping them down. Giannis is hooting 57%. He is having a way better series than their regular season clashes given the circumstances (he is way better than the rest of his team and is carrying at this point).
"I saw [this](https://twitter.com/tomhaberstroh/status/1409970879136616451?s=21) on Twitter. Not Capela necessarily but bad free throw shooter do tend to take longer. Giannis, Montrezl, Gobert, and DeAndre Jordan are all culprits"
"Are ppg and fg% the things that decide who's the goat? If so, DeAndre Jordan is yours.   Everyone has their own definition of greatness. Here's mine: no excuses. I don't have to defend Bill Russell. You look at any other player's career, you see black marks, failures, times when it was too early or too late for them to win a ring. Bill Russell won.   You want a BOAT debate, Bill Russell loses. But this is the GOAT debate, and the way I see it, people talk about stats and shit because when it comes to winning, there is no debating who's king."
Still can’t believe Deandre Jordan made 1st team all nba
"Uhhhhhhhhhhh weren't the lob city Clippers one of the most ""fun"" team in the last decade??? And they were pretty damn good too if it wasn't for injuries and Doc Rivers just adding washed up players that used to play for him. Tricked the NBA into thinking that DeAndre Jordan was a first team all NBA level player too lmao."
A lot of people are already memory-holing that DeAndre Jordan was All-NBA three times.
Deandre Jordan  Goran Dragic (international competition though idk)  Hayward  Brook Lopez  Jeff Teague
Or DeAndre Jordan lol
"So from the 2016 team I found deandre Jordan, Drummond, cousins, and melo.   My first thought went to melo but I don’t think he would be okay with playing in garbage minutes. I don’t know if you can argue Drummond and cousins fit love’s role, especially because they can’t shoot and the roster already has Adebayo.   What do you think? I’m trying to be genuine so please don’t think I wanna argue just because you said privilege lol"
Why didn’t any other rim-running center do this then? Why doesn’t DeAndre Jordan hold this record instead
"Lets not act like All-NBA first team is always top 5 players, even DeAndre Jordan has one"
"I haven't watched enough Ayton but... is he like totally incapable of being trusted with an entry pass in the low post? I don't recall seeing a single attempt at one. Suns are treating him like he's Deandre Jordan, only allowed to have lobs and putbacks."
The league was already sissified when they put DeAndre Jordan in a wig for that State Farm ad.
"Deandre Jordan was All NBA too, shit I guess the 7th pick is fucking worthless these days huh.. It’s not like Steph Curry was drafted 7th, Kawhi and Giannis drafted at 15th and MVP Jokic at 41st.. but you won’t trade Siakam for a 7th pick and a 2nd year of former 2nd pick of the draft bc Siakam is going to drag you to the championship as the number 1 option right?"
He’s not the pnr maestro or floor general that cp3 is. CP3 turned deandre jordan into an all NBA center meanwhile curry’s centers have been zaza pachulia and past-prime Andrew Bogut.
"And Michael wouldn't be in the goat conversations without Pippen. That's a fact. Pippen took on the responsibility to get rebounds, get teammates involved, score, and defend the best player. Jordan could do some of that, not at Pippen's level but he was such a gifted scorer and had the flashy plays so he got all the attention.  For example, take a look at Suns vs Clippers game 4. Booker played poorly, shot 8/22, but still scored 25 pts, 2 Reb,  2 STL, 0 AST, and 5 TO. DeAndre Ayton shot 8/14, scored 19 pts, 22 reb, 3 AST, 4 blk, 1 STL. But all headlines said Devin Booker's 25pts lead Suns past Clippers. That's a garbage headline. Ayton was the most valuable but mainstream media didn't give him that credit.  Imagine that happening during your whole career!"
"DeAndre Jordan + either #27 or combo of #44,47,57 for anything.   Really feel like the Nets are going to move #27 for something and Jordan at 2yrs/$20m isn’t terrible to move to a rebuilding team.    Right now for the Nets that’s just $10m in Luxury Tax $ since it’s obvious he’s washed and Harden was always bitching at him for his lack of effort.   Brooklyn has picks 27, 44, 47, and 57 this year. They probably won’t use all of those picks since they’re not going to be developing a bunch of Rookies while trying to compete for a Championship."

You can have one lightly bruised Deandre Jordan for… I guess Thad?
Not a stat but that Deandre Jordan was 1st team All NBA. That's wild.
DeAndre Jordan being 1st Team All NBA is FUCKING WILD. CP3 really is point God.
I was at a Brandon Knight basketball camp and at lunch all the kids were asking about him getting posterized by Deandre Jordan and getting crossed by JR Smith. It was pretty funny at the time
Can’t believe DeAndre Jordan was 1st team all-NBA and Harden didn’t make an all-NBA team that year lmao
OH WHATTA MONSTER JAM BY DEANDRE JORDAN
I'd take DeAndre Jordan too because of that no basket interference rule from FIBA.  One reason Dwight Howard was unstoppable in Beijing 2008.
DeAndre Jordan may become serviceable again with no 3 seconds and no offensive goaltending.
“DeAndre Jordan”
The old DeAndre Jordan strategy.  Classic.
"Mark Cuban is a man who knows where he wants to go. More importantly, he knows which avenues one must take to get there. Yet it remains to be seen if this know-how was at all useful late Wednesday night when the billionaire investment shark found himself swimming in very dark, very unsure waters.     A tiny bead of water trickled down, flowing into and connecting with equally tiny rivers interwoven about the windshield of Cubans Lexus LX. The darkness outside his vehicle was only interrupted by small islands of light pillar-hoisted high above the shoulders of the quiet suburban street resting on the outskirts of Dallas. The inside of his car was equally dark, save for one solitary island of light - Cuban's cellular phone.     While the lights outside raced by like the stretched visage of stars within a warp drive, Cubans right thumb was frantically tapping and fluttering about the glass face of his smart phone. His left hand, with sweat beading at his wrist, squeezed the steering wheel like a vice grip. Somewhere between the right hand and the left Cubans face sat contorted upon a throne of pure agony, distress and heartbreak.     There was a lone fish that eluded this world renowned shark investor. Deandre Jordan, the free agent, the big catch, the Mavericks next meal ticket. It had teased him far out into the black waters of uncertainty. He had chased its scent earnestly, hungrily and with all past experiences of success reinforcing the belief he would find it. But all powers of scent, radar and sight were blank, his antennae found only radio silence. His begging thru texts yielding no reply. His only company was the abyss.       And so Cuban found himself crushingly alone and emotionally broken down, parked parallel to some white suburban sidewalk tracing the neatly landscaped row of sleeping homes. He couldn't find the strength inside even to put the weight of his foot on the gas pedal. He sunk into the depths of total defeat, his head pivoting backward from his shoulders to lay atop the headrest of the drivers seat.      ~~~      I dont have time to write the rest properly but it's like...  ""Out of the corner of Cubans yes he sees a movement, blinds opening. Cuban leaves, spooked. On the way home there are shadowy hooded figures seemingly everywhere, he must not have seen them before. Strange. He has the feeling he is being watched. He stops at a gas station. The clerk smiles at him knowingly. Hands him a magazine - Source Magazine. ""      the end"

"Did somebody murder Zubac and Ibaka and Batum?!?!?!    If not, I do not understand why they need a C, much less one as undesirable as DeAndre Jordan. He's closer to the unplayable tag than useful rotation C."
We're getting DeAndre Jordan lmao    😂🔫
i'd rather have a guy 4 years away than Deandre Jordan on my team right now any day
"For the love of Chick Hearn,   PLEASE DO NOT SIGN DEANDRE JORDAN"
shit for a while Deandre Jordan was a DNP while people on here were trying to tell me he was a top 5 player on the Nets
"im so confused, i thought deandre jordan was KD and kyries best friend and they wanted him there"
"Especially the team affiliation of DeAndre Jordan, Jahlil Okafor, and Sekou Doumbouya."
"We're buying out DeAndre Jordan.  And him being the age of most rookies actually goes against him here. Because he has had 2 full years of NBA-level coaching, with a HC who excels with player development, and he hasn't improved much. Saddiq, Beef Stew, Saben, hell even Killian who was injured most of the year - they were all actual rookies and they all showed more improvement last year than Sekou.  Our GM didn't pick him, but our coaching staff and front office didn't see enough from him to keep him. We're going into his 3rd year and his best basketball attribute we can point to is his age. At this point I think we have a better chance at getting a rotation player out of 4 future 2nd rounders than we do with Sekou"
I kinda want Deandre Jordan solely because he's my fiancée's favorite basketball player. She saw him on a YouTube cooking show and now goes crazy when she sees him playing basketball.
DeAndre Jordan really made 1st team all nba and all defensive first team one year.
20 is still super young though. That’s what most rookies are age wise. Wouldn’t you want to give him another shot instead of Deandre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan is not good at all lmao Lakers in the mud like a bitch
Dude really flexing about potentially signing DeAndre Jordan LOL
"Everyone keeps saying 4 picks for Sekou. Let’s be serious, the 4 picks are the price of getting rid of Jordan + Sekou. DeAndre Jordan is beyond finished. Good move by the Nets."
I don’t think any of us here watches enough Sekou to really say if this is a plus for the Nets or not..  But the idea of Deandre Jordan not being there for KD and Kyrie and Blake really make me sad.. I only rooted for the Nets last year to win it all only because of the power of friendships
It’d be hilarious if DeAndre Jordan stopped dunking
"I got the Draymond one cause I saw someone mention it in a different thread. For the deandre Jordan one, my guess was someone who’s terrible at free throws"
Deandre Jordan will follow in his footsteps and sign with the Lakers to retire
"DeAndre Jordan averaged 4.3 PPG and 4.8 PPG in his first two seasons and his average shot distances were 1.1 and 1.4 feet (*153* of his 237 made FGs in those years were dunks), so that’s an incredibly weak comparison"
"Got Kawhi, Cam, and DeAndre Jordan. These were some good ones!  Almost said Ayton for the one with Cam but I remembered someone posting Cam’s TS on this sub"
".542 on two pointers as a 7ft athletic big man is bad, and it's even worse when your PNR partner is Curry.   For reference DeAndre Jordan in his first two years finished at 0.633 and 0.603 with Baron Davis as his PNR partner."
"Kinda both ways. We got KP and THJ, who I'm so happy is a mav now. And now y'all got us Bullock now. And in the end, it is what it is. Not happy that we have the picks, but happy that we moved on from washed deandre Jordan and Tunnel vision DSJ."
"He just had the worst luck for a while. He was a modern Craig Ehlo - solid NBA player for a stretch but always had notable things happening to him.

"How much of the horrible defensive numbers  in the season was from DeAndre Jordan lmao, sometimes he played defense by staring menacingly at players"
TLC and deandre jordan were clearly the missing pieces
"Dude what are you talking about? It’s not special to be efficient when all you can do is role to the rim and dunk. Go look at Rudy Gobert/DeAndre Jordan for example, hell even Holmes had a higher TS% than him the past two seasons. Please don’t call him one of the three most efficient big men in the history of the game it’s embarrassing. Also he’s 17/85 from 3 in his career, I highly doubt he’ll ever be a stretch big. Nobody was paying him 100 over 5, maybe another team would’ve gone to 80 but that still seems high to me."
If DeAndre Jordan joins the Lakers 14
"I don’t get this.   Russ. lebron, AD vs KD, Harden, Kyrie has some of the deepest storylines in finals history already.   Add in Melo, Howard, Blake Grififn, Marc Gasol, Rondo, Millsap, Deandre Jordan.   Who cares if they’re “former stars”"
"I'm working my way through this case right now. An early claim is that Rodman has the top 7 rb% seasons. Since that graph was compiled, here are the rb% leaders by year (according to bball ref):  2009-10: Marcus Camby, 22.2%  10-11: Camby, 24.1%  11-12: Camby, 22.8%  12-13: Reggie Evans, 26.7%  13-14: Drummond, 22.3%  14-15: DeAndre Jordan, 24.5% (Drummond at 24.0%)  15-16: Drummond, 24.5%  16-17: Drummond, 25.2% (DJ at 24.2, Whiteside at 24)  17-18: DJ, 26.5% (Drummond at 26.2)  18-19: Whiteside, 25.9% (Drummond at 25.4%)  19-20: Drummond, 26%  20-21: Clint Capela, 26.1%  Now he ""only"" has 4 of the top 9 spots. The author could still have a case for the number of years Rodman was at the top (DJ and Drummond are the only two that sniff him), but the excellence of his peak has nearly been matched in this one stat that started the discussion. The argument actually gets a bit shakier due to the recent excellence: we've recently been raising the mean, which reduces how much Rodman stands out. Of course, scoring has been going up too, so MJ's excellence in that field doesn't stand out as much. Overall, it'd be cool to see this case made again."
Is that why the Nets played Claxton over DeAndre Jordan?
"I'm glad its not Portland at least. That would've been gross.  Milsap is probably not a guy who you'll want to play every night at this stage anymore, but he should be way more useful than DeAndre Jordan. Still smart and a plus defender, but he's not going to give you much on offense anymore. Go get yourself a ring Paul Milsap!"
"DeAndre Jordan just had a garbage season on a contending superteam that desperately needed big man depth, singlehandedly destroyed their defense when he was on the floor, and ended up completely out of the rotation for the playoffs. Why would he be any different on the Lakers?"
"This is such BS lmao. How do people upvote this ?  Rondo must have thrown that spin lob to AD maybe 15 or 20 times in 2020. It had zero impact on AD’s efficiency whatsoever.  Also even in an injured season this year, AD’s efficiency on post ups wasn’t far off Jokic’s.  Also also AD averaged an efficient 32 ppg on the no1 defense Warriors in the playoffs in 2015 *without a starting PG*. He was 22.  I swear you guys think a perennial MVP candidate is fucking DeAndre Jordan or some shit."
"Guys are kicking around and playing better into their mid and late 30s in this day and age.   It's crazy but it's true.   I'm not concerned in the least about the age of the Lakers.   Chemistry is the only concern, and most of that roster has played well together, so it's just a matter of getting Westbrook to fit in.   If he doesn't... no big deal. They still got LeBron and AD with great vet pieces around them (Rondo, Dwight, Ariza Melo).   And the got a solid PG rotation with Nunn, who is a promising young point guard. I was surprised they picked him up for so little to be honest. They got some strong 3-pt shooters sitting on the bench in Monk, Bazemore and Ellington (who played really well for the Pistons this year).   In they got Marc coming back and pick up DeAndre Jordan, that shores up the center spot. They can do a center-by-committee approach with those two and Dwight.   I'm excited to see what that roster can pull off."
Byron Russell and Deandre Jordan are dumb choices.
People who are excited about DeAndre Jordan joining their team are the definition of casual NBA fans. There's a reason he's being bought out. Sheesh
"Yea but this is basically a do or die game, in crunch time, in the 4th. There’s actually no point in dunking it so hard other than hype. A simple 2 handed slam wouldve been enough to have the same effect. Its similar to the deandre Jordan alley oop in game 7 back in 2015. At this moment, you are playing to win not for the highlight. Theres no excuse for that."
"&gt;Also, you really dont think 5 years is enough time to improve your free throw shot when you have millions of dollars to access some of the best training on Earth?  Do you think guys like LeBron, Shaq, Dwight, DeAndre Jordan, etc.... never worked on their free throw shooting?"
2018 Deandre Jordan had a value of 250 million? Really?
"&gt;yes easily, people tend to forget how easy the basketball hall of fame is to get into.  This has become a meme. People now OVERSTATE how easy it is to get in. Kyrie has three all-NBAs (no firsts), has played 582 regular season games (equivalent to 7 full seasons), and has never been the best guy on a championship contender. Could he make it? Maybe. Is it a lock? No way.  You know who else has similar career accolades to Kyrie (1 second team All-NBAs and 2 third team All-NBAs)? Gilbert Arenas. Jermaine O'Neal. Chauncey Billups. Penny Hardaway. DeAndre Jordan. Mark Price. Shawn Kemp. Marques Johnson. None in the Hall of Fame."
"Sounds like he’ll go to another team in another city with no mandate. Durant and deandre Jordan were watching the live too, anyone else see that?"
Even as a fan the clippers handled this situation poorly by not being upfront. You went through all of the ceremony stuff and you should just let him know we want to start over. I don’t think the team wanted DeAndre Jordan around after getting rid of Blake.   I doubt he ever returns but you never know next season
"&gt; Idk I mean KD only choose Brooklyn because it’s what Kyrie chose and he wanted to play with Kyrie right?  We're a little far removed from that, KD has signed an extension before Kyrie was even offered one. They hired the coach that KD wanted, they even demoted their friend Deandre Jordan to 3rd string C and eventually got rid of him. With Harden and KD I don't think everything revolves around Kyrie anymore.  I do think it's a bit of overthinking, at least RIGHT NOW there is no logical reason for the Nets to offer Kyrie an extension. He's literally not with the team so like, what's the incentive to do it now? Sure Harden could leave, but I think this team is going to be wildly successful and he'll realize it's his best option at winning. Harden and KD together, when healthy, are easily the best duo in the league they're HOF talents. MAYBE he could walk if things go sideways but I think you have to kind of push Kyrie to the side for now, focus on who is there and building something successful with them"
"Hard to say what our young players prime will look like. Lakers just have legends who destroyed the league in their prime. Prime LeBron, AD, Westbrook, Dwight, Rondo, Ariza and Deandre Jordan!??? Bruh it’s over."
The depth of league at center is way less than it is at guard and forward. If someone like Embiid or Jokic gets hurt its definitely possible ayton could sneak into 3rd team if the Suns have one of the top records in the NBA.   All-NBA voters tend to favor players on teams with better records. Just look at DeAndre Jordan making All-NBA in 2017 over KAT Cousins while putting up only 13 pts with 14 rbs.
"A slightly better Deandre Jordan shouldn’t be a max player, simple as"
"Not really met so much as walked by them. Me and a few buddies went to a nets @ pelicans game a year or so ago. After the game we decided to go have a little fun at Harrahs Casino when we drunkenly stumbled upon DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, and one more player that I can’t recall.  There wasn’t much of an entourage around them so they were pretty low key.  The only reason we realized who they were is because it’s pretty hard to miss DeAndre walking around in a duster."
https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pl5sgb/schiffer_deandre_jordan_went_to_kenny_aktinson/  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/01/04/nets-coach-steve-nash-doesnt-want-to-turn-deandre-jordan-jarrett-allen-situation-into-mini-drama/  Both about his troubles and arguments with Nash over being relegated from a starting position.  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/9/20/22684115/deandre-jordan-lakers-nets-buyout-pistons-brooklyn-los-angeles-rivalry  This is more lowkey but seems to be taking shots at the Nets not playing him enough in reference to his move to the lakers.
This was the same era where DeAndre Jordan was All NBA 1st team  Bigs were horrible
"Yeah the second greatest pure point ever, who's also also a top 40 player all-time, one of the best closers in the game and someone respected by every person who knows or watches hoops is more valueable than someone who heavily thrives off Paul. People thought Deandre Jordan was the best center in the league because of what cp3 does for bigs. Cp3 helped Tyson Chandler, Dj, Griffin, Ayton and capella. Yes I am very biased"
"Doc Rivers was brought into compete for a title with Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. He wasn't brought in to draft well and develop late first rounders and second rounders. Clippers had a legit shot at winning it all from 2012-2017 including 2 division titles, 57, 56, 56, 53 and 51 win seasons.  As an executive, he drafted Reggie Bullock at #25 (great pick), and then traded a late second rounder and Bledsoe for a package including JJ Redick who was instrumental in their 50 win seasons.  In 2014, he traded a dissapointing Dudley and a late first rounder to Milwaukee for a second rounder, Carlos Delfino an expiring was waived for cap space and Miroslav Raduljica.  Later, he selected CJ Wilcox at #28, hard to blame him for a #28 pick not panning out.Traded a late first rounder for Jeff Green, who was only 29 and played a big role on their 2016 team. Drafted Brice Johnson at #25 who didn't pan out, again, late first rounders hardly ever do.  In 2018 he traded a late first rounder for Danilo Gallinari who was coming off an all star esque season and would go on to be their best player the following season.  So in the what 8 years that your stat encompases they were competing for a title and werent focusing on developing late first rounders or second rounders, or going through a quick rebuild and contending again with Kawhi/PG, this isn't that surprising IMO."
"It's on a lesser scale, but everyone was also saying they would never get rid of DeAndre Jordan because he was best friends with Kyrie and KD."
"With Mo Bamba rumored to be on the trade block, it would be interesting to see them pick him and and run the most dominant defensive lineup in the league.   My true hope is that Bamba goes to Dallas and plays along side Luka. I think he can become a Deandre Jordan type center, but with a jumper. He just needs a playmaking smart PG like CP3 was for Jordan. If this happens you will see Bamba become more relaxed and play more to his strengths. I think FVV can do this for him as well."
"In a league where wall, Isaac, deandre Jordan, Wiggins, bertans, porz and Love exist you call D'Angelo one of the worst contracts?"
"Nets depth is much better this year with Mills, Millsap, Aldridge. Cam Thomas is a boss and might not even get much PT.  And DeAndre Jordan being gone is addition by subtraction. Sorry DJ."
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
First would be Deandre Jordan as he forgot there was a time limit   Winner would be Nurkic you don't fk with Bosnia

Only reason I could figure out as to why DeAndre is starting is if Dwight specifically asked to come off the bench lol. Jordan is washed beyond belief.
"I mean if u been watching since only the 80s u never saw Wilt or Bill so u can't really speak on them. By all accounts, both of them would be athletic freaks even by todays standards. Both of them competed in track and high jump, broke and set some records too. Bill would've qualified for Olympic high jumps most likely.   Think there's a decent amount of guys that were as explosive as Giannis, it's just his ball handling, footwork and flexibility that makes the difference compared to bigs of the past. He can just drive it to the rim himself and finish it. Guys like Kemp, Xavier Mcdaniels, Larry Nance, Darryl Dawkins were older players with similar athleticism. More recently guys like Blake Griffin, Dwight, Mcgee, Amare, Deandre Jordan, Jeremy Evans even lol."
"My theory is that KD is actually one of the few players being 100% honest about his height, everyone else is just lying. Most people assume KD is 7ft cos he's skinny and lanky plus that pic of him standing next to Cousins and Deandre Jordan where he looks visibly taller. We know shorter bigs lie to get into the perceived good height range which is around 6'10 to 7ft. KD probably 6'9.5 to 6'9.75 barefoot but uses that height so he can play the 3. Add an 1-1.5 inches for shoes. Most bigs probably using their height with shoes which why bigs that are 7ft look the same size as KD in pics."
*deandre jordan leaves the chat*
Deandre Jordan needs to play 0 minutes this season. Even starting him in preaseaon is a waste. I want to see them practice small ball with AD out since they might need it because they no longer have Morris
"Cuban will never be more than a 5 until he stops having final say over personnel decisions. It was clear during their GM search this offseason that he was never going after someone like Masai who demands autonomy over roster moves. He created such a toxic front office structure that resulted in opposing GMs not knowing who had final say on trades within the organization. He let a shadow-GM who made his money as a gambler select Josh Green over Saddiq Bey in the 2020 draft, the last top 20 pick the Mavs will have in the Luka era. And none of this would have changed without the Tim Cato story - which Cuban called “bullshit” before he totally cleaned house.  I’m not even going to get into the late Dirk prime years where we were constantly being embarrassed by the Dwight Howard/Deandre Jordan chases when we could have just re-signed Tyson Chandler. Chandler Parsons was our go to Free Agent recruiter.   He did a lot of good early on by focusing on international scouting, but I’m just over the facade of Mark Cuban as trailblazing owner."
Our net rating will be better with Harden and KD playing more and the corpse of Deandre Jordan not giving up open mid-range jumpers all game
Get rid of Deandre Jordan man he stinks
"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/sekou-doumbouya-31572/  &gt;Traded to Brooklyn (BKN) from Detroit (DET) with Jahlil Okafor for DeAndre Jordan, $5.78 million , 2022 2nd round pick [BKN pick] , 2027 2nd round pick [BKN pick] , 2024 2nd round pick [WAS or MEM pick (more favorable)] and 2025 2nd round pick [WAS or GSW pick (more favorable)]  it's 'cause Brooklyn _really_ wanted to get DJ off their books."
Also the DeAndre Jordan texts
I was surprised at how good Deandre Jordan looked in this game. Lakers got a GD steal signing him for just 2 million! If Poole is gonna shoot 40% from 3 this year Lakers need to really work on their Perimeter defense. I know this is preseason but if Warriors go into the playoffs with 3 guys that all shoot 40%+ from three point range that's trouble for Lakers and everyone else in the West.
Washed up Deandre Jordan got 10 points😂 AD going to feast against these trash ass warriors
why didn't you post that nasty ally oop to deandre jordan?
Deandre Jordan is a worse defender than Montrezl Harrell and it's not even close
Its made DeAndre Jordan look good lmao
Deandre Jordan out there looking like discount Ronny Turiaf
We're starting DeAndre Jordan so I think that cancels out. But we do have Russ
Deandre Jordan could use some of that Nugenix
"Oh god, DeAndre Jordan is starting again? :/"
"The Lakers are starting DeAndre Jordan, LeBron James, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk and Russell Westbrook.  Should be fun."
"I guess, i just can't wrap my mind around a coach taking that Lakers roster and starting Deandre Jordan, unless something else was up"
For starting Deandre Jordan
"I dont think being all NBA is that big of an accomplishment during those years, there was no other big men worthy of those awards. His contemporaries around that time were Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Karl Anthony-Towns. Not exactly other future first ballot hall of famers. Getting voted to the all star game is the same thing, who cares about the center all star spot, his competition at the time was Rudy Gobert, someones whose entire future legacy will be based around covid.  Statistical leader doesnt mean anything either, Chris Kaman was a 20/10 player not to long ago, stats are easy on non-playoff teams.  Also I never said he was a bad player, only that his accomplishments rang really hollow because NO sucked, and the one time he did do something in the playoffs, it was off the back of Jrue playing at an incredible level."
"So much can change  In the December before DeAndre Jordan was drafted he was slated to go top 5, as winter and spring ended nbadraft.net and other sites had him in the early 2nd round, which is where the Clippers got him"
"I think Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, and Tim Duncan, were all clearly better than him that whole time, and you could make an argument for Al Horford, Joakim Noah, and DeAndre Jordan too. Towards the tail-end of that time-frame, Anthony Davis and Rudy Gobert also surpassed him."
"Counting on DeAndre Jordan to give any semblance of effort in this day an age is a losing battle.  No worries, though, he's just fooled another franchise into paying him when he retired 3 years ago."

"He’s literally the modern day poster boy for athletic dominance and bully ball and somehow gets a pass for it when players in the past like Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Kenneth Faried, Lebron James in his early days in Cleveland, were all crucified for relying solely on their athleticism. It’s so nauseating how he gets a pass just because of his story or whatever else it is."

Oh shit! Deandre Jordan is still in the league?!?!
"&gt; But due to his terrible fit on the Lakers and being way past his prime, was Deandre Jordan the worst starter in the NBA through the first 6 games?  I dunno about worst starter in the league but I found it comical that some people thought he'd still be good as a lob threat when he previously played with probably the best PnR player in the entire NBA and was awful."
goddamn it. i was enjoying see the lakers lose. not sure why the fuck deandre jordan somehow weasles his way into starting jobs.
As a lifelong Lakers fan I believe I speak for the entire fanbase when I say we are absolutely disgusted with this start to the season! I also feel i speak for everyone when I say the answer to this problem is to play DeAndre Jordan MORE minutes! Coming from a diehard Lakers fan btw.
NO MORE STARTING DEANDRE JORDAN  🥳🥳🥳
Frank Vogel is the one choosing to start Deandre Jordan.
"What's unbelievable is he's not ""just"" doing a Tyson Chandler/Deandre Jordan type of thing, it's not 5 pnr dunks per game.  The dude is just a crazy good finisher even on non dunks.  And he's also perfectly solid defensively at worst.  There's not that many good 2 way centers in the league and he is one of them"
"Also, the obvious follow-up to that question is, ""then why hasn't your team signed him?"" And the obvious answer is, because they already have too many centers given how flexible that role is in the modern NBA. And most teams have a similar answer to that question.  The Lakers are the only team where I can see the logic for replacing somebody that's in the rotation with Cousins. And given that they're in the luxury tax, that would mean paying something like 4 million just to maybe upgrade from DeAndre Jordan to Cousins, which I can't really blame them for not doing. It's tough to fit a guy who's had multiple debilitating injuries and is a liability defensively at a position where most teams prioritize good defense."
I’d take him over deandre Jordan
efficient finisher != elite finisher  you think DeAndre Jordan is an elite finisher too?
DeAndre Jordan
"&gt;Giannis needs ONE specific style of teammates around him because of his unique skillset. In comparison to Lebron, there is no one specific style of player or play that is required.  No, there is. He wants offball 3nD. This has been proven over and over. Giannis doesn't NEED spacing, like Lebron doesn't NEED non ball dominant players, but both REALLY want it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Maybe you want to check the usage rates of Wade, Kyrie, Davis, Westbrook if you think Lebron hasn't played with ball dominant players. 3&amp;D? That's what Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, Chris Anderson, Javale Mcgee, Deandre Jordan, Anderson Varejao, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Daniel Gibson, Mo Williams, Drew Gooden, Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook, and Anthony Davis are all about! /s  You wrote /s but this actually sounds like an argument, so I'm not sure whether to reply or not. Eh, whatever. Take care."
You clearly didn’t watch the game and the fact you’re mixing up Deandre Jordan with Dwight shows that. He was backing up because the shot already went up and there were 3 cavs under the rim. He was trying to stop a fast break which the cavs were killing us on. He made a good shot at the end of the clock it’s not that complicated
"I love Dejounte’s game, he’s one of my favorite players in the league.  This is actually a pretty good observation, OP. It’s a shame that the whole triple double discussion is so polarizing - I am guilty of being down on it at times myself.    This is because a lot of the narrative has been that getting triple doubles is a skillset that Westbrook simply possesses. It dismisses multiple other stats and fundamental team principles, which were essential for him to average those numbers. I’d argue there is enough evidence to show that Westbrook set out to TRY and get triple doubles and prioritized it. He ran a stagnant offence where he was definitely able to create opportunities around the rim by driving and dishing, but also sacrificed free ball movement to increase the chance of an assist. The stats show that while in OKC, he was top 1-3 in touches per game and top 1-2 in time spent on ball, while OKC were 30th in passing. Similarly, we know that he spent one season with fewer 3-point close outs that DeAndre Jordan, had low box out rates, and had pretty high uncontested rebound %’s. I think the triple doubles are impressive and he’s an amazing talent, but we need to consider the broader context of how he averaged those numbers. You can’t do that without “hating” unfortunately.    With Dejounte, there are some interesting differences. He’s averaging almost 9 assists as a point guard in a San Antonio system which is 5th in team passing. Murray is outside the top 10 in terms of time spent on the ball and touches. 85% of his rebounds are currently uncontested though so while 9.2 rebounds is high for a guard, only 1.4 of them are contested.    Anyway, it’s early in the season - I think this is a good early observation"
"Moving your body through space is a skill. Moving a body like Giannis’s through space in the way he does takes an immense amount of skill. No, he’s not doing a whole bunch of fancy dribbling or shooting from 30 feet. But the coordination, footwork, timing, reaction speed, all of these are skills that Giannis has consistently improved on year over year. Why didn’t JaVale McGee and DeAndre Jordan put up Giannis numbers if all he has to do is run and dunk?  I imagine the people who think Giannis is a low skilled player also think Steve Nash wasn’t athletic."
Deandre Jordan a -5 in a double digit win lmfao
"No, what about prime ^deandre Jordan for him though.   ^“Prime”"
He was still much better than DeAndre Jordan
Lakers with DeAndre Jordan: 2017 Lakers  Lakers without DeAndre Jordan: 2020 Lakers
"We always dig a hole with DeAndre Jordan minutes, then climb out when he's benched."
"Deandre Jordan has to leave the rotation, the instant he goes to the bench we go on a run."
"That's true, and DeAndre Jordan clogging up the paint. But to be fair, Dwight was there the championship year and I don't remember it being so bad. It's almost like he's unhappy about the spacing and decided to give no fucks and just stand outside."
please be deandre jordan
Why do the Lakers still start Deandre Jordan?
"They literally sold the Westbrook trade in the offseason by saying how LeBron and AD would move around to PF/C in the starting lineup, and then just completely went back to their normal shit. DeAndre Jordan belongs in the Chinese league or on a yacht in retirement."
"&gt;He plays the exact same role as like 4 or 5 other guys on this roster, but he costs way more than all of them.  What is this logic? Rudy Gobert plays the exact same role as Deandre Jordan and Dwight Howard but costs way more, should you not want Rudy Gobert? Buddy costs way more because Buddy is easily one of the best shooters in the entire league.  Over the last 3 years, Monk, Nunn, and Ellington combined have made 815 threes (on 36%). Buddy on his own has made 831 threes (on 40%). Same role? Yes. Same effectiveness? Not even close.   There are cheap PGs in this league that can play when LeBron is on the bench that would be so much better on the team than 44 million/year Westbrook.  And yes, Hield is better than Westbrook at this point. Any team seriously trying to win a championship should want Hield over Westbrook."
"So Rudy Gobert at the rim is something like a 70% FG%, the only thing that stops him from being a consistently dominant offensive presence is that 1) he doesn't have a handle so teams can scheme on denying him the ball and 2) he is an inefficient free throw shooter.  Last year he had 10 FTA on less than 8 FGA per game.   You give him this you're basically turning him and guys like DeAndre Jordan into superheros because it doesnt matter they can't shoot."
"Russ doesn't fit with the Lakers roster at all. You can't play him with DeAndre Jordan, Dwight, or Rondo. He doesn't play well with Lebron either unless you want to use Lebron as a weakside shooter."
Mavs deandre jordan wanted to be wannabe Jokic  Mavs wes matthews wanted to be wannabe Kobe (understandable coz we suck then)
"Giannis' career right now is better than McHale's lol  Why do you think the arbitrary numbers you set to make McHale stand out makes him seem better?  60%+ FG percentage is heavily biased towards people that take shots in close, and field goal percentage leaders have a lot of not super impact players on it.  Like is Deandre Jordan in the discussion for top 200 players all time?  He's the field goal % leader currently.   You know McHale did that once right?  His next highest season average was 22.6 points per game and he also barely broke that 60% mark at 60.4%  If you lower it to 24 points, or lower it to 59% then dozens of other players get in lmao.  Btw did you know only Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Thaddeus Young have 800 games and averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 steals 49% FG and 30% 3P?  Lmfao"
He's definitely better than deandre jordan
kd and kyrie gave up like 5mil each for deandre jordan
"Chris Paul is like Deandre Jordan if he was shorter, better at basketball, could shoot, had handles, and played pg"
"A week ago, after our win against the Spurs I wrote that this team ain't winning shit and was downvoted to oblivion. (shoutout /u/ihateeuge)  **It took supernatural effort to get the win vs a rebuilding Detroit team, who shot 12% in the 4th quater, and we still end up giving 110+ points.**   But seriously, the Lakers, as they are right now, are horrible. This team simply is constructed in way that there is no possible solution to what is going on now.   Westbrook has been detrimental on both sides of the floor. No defense what so ever, doesn't box out, has no lateral quickness to switch when covering, doesn't go above screens, and simply doesn't hustle enough at any time to cover where he is short.  On offense sloppy turnovers, and all around bad shooting. Even his attacking in the paint has been underwhelming.   DeAndre Jordan shouldn't be on the floor more than 7-10 minutes per game. Nothing more to say there.   Anthony Davis has been great, but it won't be enough for this team to overcome all other deficiencies. LeBron James has been more injured than playing, and even when playing you could see him simply not engaged enough on defense to work. Elington, Howard, Carmelo, Monk - none of them solve what we lost this season. Solid lengthy defenders that could cover a lot of ground and chase around switches all night long. No matter what your offense is, if you can't at least provide some kind of hustle in trying to disrupt opponents schemes, you literally have to shoot perfectly all night long to negate your (non)existence in defence. **In other words - THIS TEAM CAN'T BUY A STOP!**   I seriously don't blame Vogel for this. He has proven his system can work when given personnel that suit his ideology of basketball. But because Pelinka is a bitch hiding behind his atroucious management decision this offseason, and Jeannie all supporting this, he'll be the first victim to fall in a line of this sad, miserable season that will, at best, finish with a 1st round exit. That is, if we secure playoffs."
Stewart was up in his face and didn’t do anything either. It’s the NBA no one really wants to fight Stewart was trying to look tough. He even stops in this clip when he sees DeAndre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan was about to be the last line of defense lmao
"Not just him, DeAndre Jordan isn't a rotation level player anymore."
"DeAndre Jordan looking like, ""fuck I'm gonna have to try to stop this dude aren't I?"""
Deandre ‘Right Guard’ Jordan
Best defense deandre Jordan played all year
Oof THT losing his starting spot to Deandre Jordan
"i was one of the biggest proponents of the “age doesn’t matter” argument but after watching our first 17 games or so, we have some old ass legs out there and it’s making it so we’re not competitive late in games. We’re terrible in the second half and you can tell the energy to defend and rebound isn’t consistent for all 48 mins, the only beacons of hope are THT and Reaves when he does play, i can’t help but hope that getting nunn back will help us get a little more energy out there as well but i’m having my doubts we can turn it around until we move some of these older bodies like bazemore and Deandre Jordan for some youth, especially at the wing where we need to be able to back up a tired lebron and melo"
"It is a useless stat though, a stat where DeAndre Jordan is better than SGA or Booker or where Mike Muscala and Javale McGee are better than LeBron, PG, KAT and Luka should not be taken serious at all"
"I think Lakers fans would rather sacrifice DeAndre Jordan honestly, then it’ll also force AD to play the 5 more lol"
"Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Hassan Whiteside, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson, and Clint Capela for the 3 pt contest"
Pretty sad what happened to bigs this era. At the very best the Deandre Jordan types are 2nd unit energy guys at best.
"And that's bad. Their team has  LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Russel Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony. Then they have great centers like  DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard.   Unless it is a known fact they're all washed up, that team is supposed to be scary, at least offensively."
Deandre Jordan is less damaging than Russell Westbrick
Yeah Deandre Jordan was so good back in the day
We just going to forget KD gave them DLO in exchange for a pick and cap reasons to get Deandre Jordan
Draymond’s vision and distribution is far more impactful on offense. Rudy on offense is essentially DeAndre Jordan; extremely efficient but more easily replaceable
I mean they do the same with Whiteside and the Jazz have a better ORTG with Whiteside than Gobert. unless you're saying Whiteside is better   nobody says the Lob City Clippers offense was built around DeAndre Jordan when they did what you described too
"Deandre Jordan wasn't getting 15 points a game, and again, while Gobert is not creating that much for himself he does it far better than a lot of big men in the league. Dribble hand offs to Steph is not the totally of offense, and 2020-21's Draymond inability to meaningfully provide any soet of scoring is a part of the conversation.  I do watch the games, which is why I think Gobert is better than 'no offense, bad dpoy man'."
"Compared to Gobert Dray is the greatest playmaker that’s ever touched a ball because Gobert doesn’t playmake at all. And efficiency is cool and all but when every basket is spoonfed to you and you couldn’t create your own shot against my grandma whose has two hips replaced, it really starts to matter less. Deandre Jordan had a 76TS% last year but no one thinks he’s a good scorer. Get off Bballref and watch the games or at least have a better argument than ‘But his TS% is higher so he’s better!!!’"
Check your facts son. Drummond was never first team all nba 1st team. He was 3rd team cause I remember DeAndre Jordan got the 1st team nod that year.
Lebron first game wearing a heat jersey in Cleveland..  Kevin durant with the warriors verse okc. Kyrie verse the Celtics.  Ray Allen verse the Celtics in a heat jersey.    Dwight with the lakers verse the magic.   DeAndre Jordan verse the mavericks after that one year in free agency.   Oh and derrick rose like lst week verse the bulls getting mvp chants. And fans happy every time he got fouls
saw your flair and I thought you were talking about Deandre Jordan lol
"No. Why would the 76ers want to trade someone that does what Ben simmons does on offense but shorter with less defense?  Ben simmons has no floor spacing. DeAndre jordan, Dwight Howard, A.d. aren't there best floor spacers"
It’s a line up stat. One example I’d bring up is DeAndre Jordan. He basically tanked the plus/minus of whoever he shared the court with last year.
Bazemore and Deandre Jordan need to get cut and lakers need to hope they can find someone in buyout
"Sure! Eric Gordon for DeAndre Jordan and a lottery ticket, who says no?"
I would have agreed with you but just look at the strides Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond made in just a couple off seasons. These were career 35% free throw shooters
"Is Vogel out of his god damn mind? DeAndre Jordan, Rondo, and Bazemore all playing at the same time?!"
Lakers get close Vogel: Time for DeAndre Jordan !
Lakers better play DeAndre Jordan to protect the paint!
gobert literally cannot play vs certain matches and he will decline athletically on defense. reminds me of a smarter deandre jordan
"Yeah, those things all matter...but here's the key:   AD has played 517 minutes this season.   268 of them have been with Melo and no Howard OR Jordan  160 have been with Howard OR Jordan and no Melo.   Two have been with Howard+Melo+AD. None have been AD+Melo+Jordan. There have been zero minutes with both Dwight and DeAndre on the court together.    The significant majority of AD's minutes at the 5 come with Melo at the 4.   That alone (Melo replacing Dwight or DeAndre) explains OP's numbers."
Yeah. I'd take a DeAndre Jordan game winning attempt over Curry.   If there were a last jumpshot to save my life I'd make DeAndre Jordan take it.
"&gt; And I already know that TS% incorporates 3's/weighs them differently. That's why I used FG% to compare, because Curry takes most of shots from 3 while Lebron's in 2015 were mostly at the rim. So I needed a fair comparison, which was FG%.   You didn’t need a “fair comparison”, you needed a way to negate Curry’s greatest skill because it contradicts your predetermined narrative.   There’s a reason no one uses FG% anymore in arguments about efficiency - it’s an archaic metric that doesn’t even come close to measuring a player’s efficiency…unless you’re ready to argue that DeAndre Jordan is a better offensive player than Joel Embiid because he shoots a higher FG%."
Deandre jordan vibes
"That argument was made a long time ago and is becoming shakier due to DeAndre Jordan, Drummond, Clint Capela, among others  he still has a clear cut argument for GOAT status due to dominance and sustained excellence, but calling him better at rebounding than MJ is at scoring or Steph is at 3s isn't as convincing as it was 15 years ago"
It was so the nets could free more cap space (I think technically Shabazz Napier was traded to us with dlo  lol) so that the nets could sign deandre jordan
"[Jabari Young (Portland beat writer) straight up forgot him](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/04/24/defensive-player-of-the-year-voter-admits-he-just-forgot-about-draymond-green/)  &gt; When thinking of the candidates, Green’s name just slipped my mind, as Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, Memphis center Marc Gasol, and San Antonio’s Kawhi Leonard were the selections made. Once it was discovered Green was forgotten, a change was sought but after selections are submitted, all votes are final."
"&gt; All-NBA First and Second Team indicates that someone was a top 5 or 10 player in that given year,  2013-14 Joakim Noah 1st-Team All-NBA   2014-15 Marc Gasol 1st-Team All-NBA   2015-16 DeAndre Jordan 1st-Team All-NBA    You’re saying those 3 guys were each top5 players of the entire league in those respective years? That’s not what All-NBA means lol"

"That was probably us cutting Deandre Jordan who we got from the Nets in that trade lmao   You guys got Sekou now tho, Godspeed. Dude doesn’t give a damn about basketball"
"A big reason DeRozan is working in Chicago is because of their spacing though, Vuc is a legit stretch 5 and Lavine is an elite high volume shooter. Add Lonzo and he has shooters everywhere to work with.  Lakers aren’t built like that especially if AD starts at the 4. A lineup of DeRozan-AD-Deandre Jordan is like spacing hell. Westbrook is still obviously even worse lol"
D for Deandre Jordan
"I don’t disagree, but I will say all nba teams are mean to centers, like AD has selections as both the forward and center slot. That means despite how much  talent is on display in any given year, at the most, three true centers are getting in, less when 4-5s like AD are in the mix. Plus, KAT has been more or less consistent throughout his career, yet only 1 season( when they made the playoffs) did he squeeze in on a 3rd team. If we are just going off all nba teams, Deandre Jordan is better than KAT. While winning is the barrier of entry apparently for all nba teams, it’s disproportionately effects centers on bad teams by undervaluing their impact and by virtue of having less spots. Like the year DAJ got first team, he got picked over Cousins, despite this being an individual award. I’m fact, that year Drummond was 3rd team despite KAT putting up 18/11 in his rookie year. So basically DAJ and most recipients are rewarded for being a big part of a winning team rather than the best players at each position."
Yeah it's probably mainly just not having DeAndre Jordan in the lineup. Our D was solid after we benched him last season
"I consider them a lock to make it if healthy, but not to win it all. They haven't shown any chemistry yet and Kent Bazemore and DeAndre Jordan play entirely too many minutes."
"""You gotta chase down Deandre Jordan there. Neil Funk could have caught him!""  ""Wow Funk is out here catching strays"""
"Bazemore, Westbrook, Deandre Jordan, Carmelo., Rondo...it's the all NBA bad defense team."
"How so?   * Edwards has a mid-range and three.   * He drives aggressively off the dribble.   * He dunks as hard if not harder than Jordan.   * He is explosive on defense and with steals.   I’m talking about Michael Jordan, not Deandre Jordan nephew."
"This reminds me of deandre jordan lol. Dude has the prettiest form, just needed to change his routine to become 70% freethrow shooter"
"Important to note, the Warriors signed Restricted Free Agent DeAndre Jordan to a 4 yr 43 million dollar deal in 2011, and had the Clippers not matched it, then the Warriors never trade for Andrew Bogut. Which is massive, because DeAndre did not become an above average starting center until about year 4 of his contract. Even though DeAndre was a great athlete, he had nowhere close to the basketball IQ of Bogut, who was instrumental towards how the Warriors came to be as a basketball team.  Not getting DeAndre Jordan helped the Warriors so much."
Lol looked like deandre Jordan was pushing an invisible walker out there
"""I'm back."" - DeAndre Jordan to Detroit"
For some reason I thought the the player being discussed was DeAndre Jordan and I got very confused.
Fake news deandre Jordan was a +5. Stop talking about things you don’t know
"It seems like a who-whos of has-beens. DeAndre Jordan, Carmelo Anthony, West 🧱, Rondo, and Dwight Howard would have been sick.... in 2010."
Baze is getting first maybe second to Deandre Jordan
Bazemore and Deandre Jordan gonna get cut just for starters
THT and DeAndre Jordan- garbage time c0-MVPs
Omg I’m dying here with Stacey dunking on Deandre Jordan.
are announcers are roasting Deandre Jordan lmao
What’s with Lakers and always having a geriatric squad?   Didn’t know DeAndre Jordan was still in the league
"PG Elfrid Payton   SG Tim Hardaway Jr.   SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Marcus Morris   C Kristaps Porzingis  Bench: Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, Bobby Portis, Reggie Bullock, Justin Holiday, Wayne Ellington, DeAndre Jordan, Austin Rivers  I knew we would be bad but yikes"
"They should. It would be a huge sacrifice for us, but we're willing to give away DeAndre Jordan"
"The incredible, astounding magic of no longer starting DeAndre Jordan. Half washed Blake is basically Rodman on crack dipped in steroids by comparison."
Literally nothing will ever come close to Chris Paul yelling at Deandre Jordan to shoot the ball. The absolute disgust in Chris Paul’s eyes is just palpable.  https://youtu.be/XNxr0m3YkX0
"&gt;  at a discount. You could have saved money on players like DeAndre Jordan to keep him.  This bit is nonsense. AC was offered 4/37 by the Bulls, and even with  discount, he isnt getting less than 3/27  While DeAndre is costing the Lakers $1.6 m (League picks up the rest of the vet minimum)  Lakers might have kept that 15th spot open, if they had Caruso (instead of going for AB), but at best that's $3.2 m vs $9m or over 3x that if you factor in tax.  Plus in one sense, AC's replacement is Austin Reaves who is a very chep contract (~800- 900 K)   There's no universe in which the Lakers would have saved money by picking Caruso (on top of THT)   This is a different argument from saying it would have been worth it, BTW"
Gotta be DeAndre Jordan
Joe Lacob is not the only owner willing to dip into paying a little tax to try and win.  Caruso was willing to stay with the Lakers *at a discount*. You could have saved money on players like DeAndre Jordan to keep him.
Literally two games ago vs the heat deandre Jordan started with AD at the 4
"So apparently only TS% matters to you. OK then, I guess DeAndre Jordan is now better than Michael Jordan because he had a better TS%."
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12.

Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
DeAndre Jordan became  a better free throw shooter than LeBron.   How come LeBron never figured it out?
"The former DPOY is the one many call an offensive liability and doesnt deserve to be all star. Hes not longer the same offensive player he once was. The former #1 pick is called a bust by many. Who's the other top 10 picks? I swear if you say Iggy and OPJ youre clueless. Iggy is freaking 37 years old and OPJ is no longer the same player he was.  If youre talking about the past Lakers have a former MVP, a top 10 player in the league few years back, Carmelo anthony was a top 5-10 player last time as well. Not to mention Deandre Jordan and Howard, who were both all stars. Realise how dumb that sounds?"
I dont get why starting is that big of a deal...except for ego.  deandre Jordan starts and he's playing like 15 min a game.
"DeAndre Jordan started for the Nets a lot last season. Pretty much anyone on the bench would’ve been an improvement, and that’s including non centers or even forwards. Hell, even Nash would’ve been better."
Totally. I can’t stand it when people think he’d be deandre jordan if he played today.
"Durant could have signed with the Nets without an S&amp;T, but he and Kyrie (also an FA) wanted DeAndre Jordan, who was looking for $10mil/year, to join the Nets with them. The Nets had a lot of cap space but couldn’t sign all 3 of them unless they had somebody’s Bird rights which meant that they could go over the cap, so they decided to do the S&amp;T with the Warriors because DLo and the Warriors had a mutual interest, meaning all parties would be satisfied."
Bamba has been trash now as soon as he starts to develop you expect to acquire him for DeAndre Jordan 😂
OP SAID DEANDRE JORDAN FOR MO BAMBA LOL
Deandre Jordan.
"I suspect that Warriors can get around his defense one way or another, but the amount of effort they took to include him in offense was just demolishing their team. There's just so little stuff he can do beside putting the ball in the basket, and that part really did result in him getting many baskets, but they had to try so hard for it, to make a free space just under the basket so he can get the ball in one place he can use it.  People always mocked DeAndre Jordan, but there is some art to getting the lob. It cannot be the only thing you do or it's too easy to defend. Well that's what I feel at least."
These guys floors are starters. Kuminga’s already shown defense and driving to the rim. Wiseman may take time but at worst he’ll be a Deandre Jordan type lob threat and shot blocker. Moody is a safe pick with a floor around a poor man’s Mikal Bridges. We drafted very well.
"The Lakers are officially a disgrace! Look at how they’ve disappointed an absolute legend like “Big Game” James Worthy, just disgusting. We all know what needs to happen, the Lakers must start rebuilding around Russell Westbrook and DeAndre Jordan. AD is way too injury prone for us to trust, and LeBum is practically a senior citizen! We need to trade them for some picks ASAP. Coming from an honest Lakers fan btw."
"In his MVP season he contested more 3s than... DeAndre Jordan. But yep, definitely deserved it."
"KCP, Kuzma and Caruso.   we're also playing Deandre Jordan for don't know what reason"
"I mean they don't only miss LBJ they also have some rotational guys missing, like Reeves, Nunn, Ariza and even tonight DeAndre Jordan (i know lol)"
"Yes. score 25 absolutely matters, DeAndre Jordan would score 10 and give up 25."
"DeAndre Jordan getting a DNP-CD in a blowout. Finally, Vogel has seen the light."
No way Deandre Jordan is better than Demarcus Cousins at this point.
DeAndre Jordan? Jordan Poole? Jordan Clarkson? Which Jordan man?
Reminiscent of DeAndre Jordan slamming it on Brandon Knight
"LeBron, Dominique, Shaq, Dr J, T Mac, Blake Griffin, Shawn Kemp, Stromile Swift, Tyrus Thomas, Amare, John Collins, Darryl Dawkins, Deandre Jordan……  I’m gonna respectfully disagree."
And the lakers are running good 7 footers? Dwight and AD are not 7 feet so you're talking about Deandre Jordan?
Best: Melo  Worst: DeAndre Jordan
Makes me sad thinking that we could still have Zu right now instead of DeAndre Jordan smh
"DeAndre Jordan going 1v1 v Giannis, Embid and even AD if that’s the finals matchup."
"Dude have you watched BKN? DeAndre Jordan will have to defend Embiid, Bam and Giannis, Anthony Davis. Kyrie is still MIA and has a history of injuries. If one of these guys goes down in the playoffs with no depth BKN is in serious trouble."
"Don't they have DeAndre Jordan? I mean I don't know, I actually wasn't watching Nets games."
That is one good defender now quick question who is going to defend the rim? the declining DeAndre Jordan?
Imagine if they got DeAndre Jordan from the Nets...
Already have Deandre Jordan
DeAndre Jordan told them to do so
technically they have 3 because deandre jordan made it in 2015-16
"deandre jordan (im only half-joking, DJ actually made all nba 1st team in 2015-16 but he's washed now though)"
Lol come on of course they got better. Deandre Jordan is still a serviceable rim protector and they can always trade for someone like Nerlens Noel. And Bruce Brown is underrated. Of course Kyrie and Harden will be staggered too to help the bench out.
"I don’t like this trade for them. 3 iso heavy players, only one of which is a good defender? They lose so much depth for more iso? I guess if Steve can make it work but I don’t like the downgrade of only having DeAndre Jordan as their center, Allen was way better"
"Box and one on Deandre Jordan   You’re welcome, Jeannie Buss now bring me my money"
And if Deandre Jordan slows with age their center depth is gonna be painfully bad
"They won't have a lot of cap space, Brooklyn is a big market but idk, we can't say right now if they will be the destination for good role players. They better be, or else a Deandre Jordan playing a lot of minutes in the playoffs won't make them a title contender."
Nets banking on Deandre Jordan randomly becoming an all-defensive player again through the power of friendship
"Not really. Kyrie is injury prone and Harden chokes in the playoffs. They still need a real leader on that team too which they don't have, and DeAndre Jordan isn't going to succeed guarding against Embiid, Jokic, AD, etc."
Yea if they can’t make a move and DeAndre Jordan doesn’t start playing way better fast the Nets might have a bottom tier defense.
Defensive facilitator deandre Jordan of course
"Yeah this team might struggle heavily against top big men, provided that Deandre Jordan is no longer a good enough defender."
Deandre Jordan belongs in no “death lineup”
Agreed that depth isn't that important but you need at least some of it. Now there's no above average NBA players on that roster outside of Harris tbh and they literally have no bigs outside of DeAndre Jordan. That's not good. The Dinwiddie injury is really hurting now
Deandre Jordan is still like 40x better than Aron Baynes and Alex Len. At least he has functioning hands and a vertical more than 15 inches
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
yeah who do they have at centre now?  Deandre Jordan and ??????
"Let's not get this twisted, Houston Rockets are the winners here without a doubt. 8 draft picks, AND Vixtor Oladipo. Please understand, Kevin Durant is dropping 30 points every playoff game, but Unless he becomes a huge defensive threat, this team seems destined to come up short. Yes they can score at will. Yes they can probably shoot you to death, but they just traded away the man who glued their defense together, Jarret Allen. That man never had a silent game, he is so Rudy Gobert-like in the sense that even without him reaching for it he affects shots. AND HE'S ONLY 22! The Nets are laying down all their hopes on how well DeAndre Jordan and KD can defend the paint. KD will of course be playing the 4 or the 3 most of the time.  You're betting all your money that DeAndre Jordan is going to defend Embiid, Giannis, Bam and the Boston forwards. Back to back to back, then go on to defend against Anthony Davis.  People, DJ was outstanding in LA, but now they're asking him to be DPOY over all these other great and young bigs.  Unless more changes are coming, this just seems like a great 2021 regular season team! They'd have to sell kyrie just to afford more salary space!  TLDR: Houston Rockets are the winners of the trade and could potentially be favorites over Brooklyn next season."
When you need a wall to beat Giannis you better have something more than Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan to build it
They definitely need another Center at the very least. Playing KD or Jeff Green there extensively will not work in the postseason and they don’t have anyone deserving of any minutes outside DeAndre Jordan there.  Maybe they can flip Joe Harris for more of a defensive player? Not sure if they could trade Dinwiddie still if he’s on the DPE.
I’m nervous about their depth they’ll have Deandre Jordan playing C for most the game and lose Jallen and Levert
"Unless durant gets injured, kyrie retires to go and visit the lonely side of planet pancake and james decides playing with deandre jordan as the second option sucks and demands a trade to the Knicks."
The last 2 teams to beat Giannis did so because they had incredible personnel at the 3/4/5 to play defense on him. Think the nets will be able to build the wall with KD and DeAndre Jordan? Lmfao
You mean you weren't impressed with the DPOY potential of the corpse of Deandre Jordan?
Deandre Jordan.... https://imgur.com/gallery/dTcAHZc
"The nets defense is going to be terrible, they desperately need to make another trade or signing. I mean look at this roster they will be playing now:  Kyrie Irving / Landry Shamet / Bruce Brown  James Harden / Tyler Johnson  Joe Harris / Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Kevin Durant / Jeff Green  Deandre Jordan / Reggie Perry  The offensive firepower is insane but who would stop Giannis and Lopez down low?"
"Your best defenders are KD, then DeAndre Jordan who has looked really bad this year. After that Jeff Green and who???? Timothy Luwawu-Cabborat?  Even if it doesn’t end up a problem versus the 76ers I don’t think they can win a championship without more defensive help."
Flip Deandre Jordan for Wiseman while you are at it.
"DeAndre Jordan and Jeff Green lol  Harden Durant Kyrie is a monster offense, so many mismatches they can exploit"
"DeAndre Jordan is a solid post defender. P&amp;R he’s garbage, but the post he’s really good."
"Honestly way too early to call this a super team. Is there loads of top heavy talent, absolutely. But there are so many holes in this team, like perimeter defense and having more than one big body that isn’t named Deandre Jordan."
DeAndre Jordan really about to be playing 30+ minutes huh
"They're going to need to trade Kyrie for more depth. Their depth just got destroyed, and they have no picks for the future. Dude ain't showing up to work anyway. And the Nets biggest problem is not enough defense. DeAndre Jordan w/ no Jarrett Allen sounds like a disaster in the paint."
Deandre Jordan lolol
"Ehh, they had the deepest team in the league.  They’ll be fine with TLC and Jeff Green and um, Bruce Brown.  Pretty solid bench guards/wings.  Joe Harris at the 3.  Backup Center and frankly starting center is the real problem.  Against most teams it doesn’t matter but against Milwaukee, Philly and the Lakers they need a better big man then Deandre Jordan."
"Hmm. I'm just really not sure about this honestly. Either Brooklyn is amazing or they completely implode. Plus now they have to play the ghost of Deandre Jordan, who AD will feast upon if they make the finals."
What do you mean?! They have two-time first team all-defense DeAndre Jordan!
They put all their eggs into DeAndre Jordan.
"Worse, significantly worse. Both those teams played defense.  Both those teams had an offense system.  This Nets team gonna be a mess.  You can't start Deandre Jordan at center and have no backup for him.  Lakers still heavy favorites imo."
DeAndre Jordan is like a rebooted Kendrick Perkins with some kinda hops remaining lol.  And KD pushed for them to give him an albatross contract despite living the og Kendrick experience.
lol i’d still put bucks in the conversation despite nets having 3 superstars on the nets team. Giannis looking at deandre jordan like bbq chicken
Deandre Jordan is manifesting those vegan Dunkin’ Donuts powers rn
FUCK OFFFFFFF  WE GAVE UP LEVERT &amp; ALLEN &amp; KEPT FUCKING DEANDRE JORDAN?!?!!!
The nets traded away their best chance to guard AD and the lakers are supposed to be worried? Is Deandre Jordan going to guard him a whole series?
I feel so bad. He was playing so good too. Now all the Nets have is washed Deandre Jordan.
All they have is an old ass Deandre Jordan lol who tf is gonna guard AD
HARDEN FOR DEANDRE JORDAN STRAIGHTUP
I imagine they will have joe Harris playing off these guys who can shoot and deandre Jordan   What’s the nets bench situation look like right now
What if he wasnt trying all this time and goes back to lob city DeAndre Jordan
Deandre Jordan bench piece lmao
DeAndre Jordan is their starting center now with Allen gone.
"Shout out Jarrett Allen, who outplayed DeAndre Jordan and still got used as filler"
"Wtf? Did we at least get like Drummond or Tucker or someone? So our only center is DeAndre Jordan (who we finally, deservedly DNPed yesterday)? And we had to keep Kyrie? After everything that just happened with him? I was so ready to jump on the ""Kyrie is a lockerroom cancer"" train. Think I'm gonna follow JA and become Cavs fan. Love me some SexLand"
"Nobody probably cares but I really feel for Jarrett Allen. He's been behind shitty Deandre Jordan cause of ""friendship"" for 1.5 years with no peep. Now he's gonna be sitting behind Drummond? Dude deserves to be a starter in the league and given a full role"
"lmao, I can't believe they gave up Jarrett Allen. Someone's got to play defense and rebound on that team. I guess Deandre Jordan is their guy now."
DeAndre Jordan is starting
"they don't have a center, DeAndre Jordan doesn't count"
"You are right that most are there for their defense/rebounding like Gobert, WCS, Biyombo, Drummond, Jarrett Allen/Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Capela, Adams, etc.  But there are also many that can spread the floor (some much better than others) like Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I think it depends on the team's playstyle because sometimes the 4 is more defensively oriented and/or the 5 is more for spacing. Many of the best centers can shoot pretty well like Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP, if they're playing the 5. Also, Vucevic? I know the drop off is steep from the top 3/5 but I think he's pretty comfortably like 6 or 7th."
Somehow the Harden trade will trigger a 5 yr max for DeAndre Jordan
pretty sure of was deandre jordan that murdered him
2015 DeAndre Jordan is who casual fans think 2021 DeAndre Jordan is.
"Nets would be a balanced scoring team for sure with him , I think Nash would benefit heavily from a Harden at PG lineup ... Not to mention harden is a gr8 lob passer so Deandre Jordan and Jarrett Allen would benefit."
"Can you not read or something?  &gt;Durant came to the Nets because he wanted to play alongside Irving, and the two of them wanted their good friend DeAndre Jordan to be part of the deal as well, but playing for Atkinson does appear to have been part of the equation. More from Charania:  &gt;Durant and Irving never connected with Atkinson and there was a growing belief that they did not have interest in playing for him when this team is whole again next season, sources told The Athletic.  Pretty explicit that Durant and irving didn't want to play for him from the beginning and that's why he was fired.  And I thought I laid out exactly why you ""wouldn't do that"" and now look where they are. Kyrie was hurt most of last year and now he's quit on the team. Basically confirms everything I said."
"They don't try to outshoot opponents, it's just that their offense is already lethal because of the player we have, while the defense is shaky because deandre jordan is a black hole, and the players haven't had much time to work together and practice, since the team has new players and there isn't much free time during covid."
"Exactly, these two and DeAndre Jordan planned this shit allegedly in 2016 to join the same team, 5 years later they all get what they wanted and now Kyrie starts dipping around doing f all.  So, who in the hell would want to trade for that prima donna, the only thing that will be traded are a boatload of Nets 1st rounders to dump him off somewhere LOL, because he isn't going anywhere nobody wants to deal with this shit"
Understood. I was prepared for a response like this.   How would you defend the fact that the following players deserved it more than Goran:   * Blake Griffin * D.J. Augustin * Isaiah Thomas * DeAndre Jordan * Lance Stephenson * Anthony Davis * Gerald Green   This isn't a post about Reggie. It is about the fucked up nature of the MIP award and specifically the 2013/14 season.
"God damn it stop inventing these stupid ass acronyms, especially when the player already has one! No one ever calls deandre Jordan DAJ, it’s just DJ."
"I bet they feel hell of a lot better then when he called out Nets to surround him, DeAndre Jordan and Garrett fucking Temple with better teammates last year."
"&gt; You’re just wrong and don’t understand basketball.  &gt; It’s evident most people on the sub are ignorant about the nba.  &gt; It’s 2021. Offense is valued over defense.  &gt; Let’s play a game here of what would you rather have with health not being a factor:  &gt; Rudy Gobert or Kristaps Porzingis?  &gt; Rudy Gobert or Vucevic?  &gt; Rudy Gobert or KAT?  &gt; You take each of these centers over Gobert based on overall skillset.  &gt; Gobert is considered a better defender than all of them, yet we wall know he’s worse than all of these centers because he’s complete ass on offense.  &gt; Being highly skilled on offense and below average on defense is by far more valued than highly skilled on defense and below average on offense. Also, all the centers I listed aren’t terrible on defense either, just slightly worse or moderately worse than how Gobert is perceived.  &gt; Come playoff time, Gobert and every other unskilled offensive big man are useless on offense and a huge liability.  &gt; The Deandre Jordan/Dwight Howard centers are a thing of the past now.  So people know what this tantrum post is in reference to. This dude is upset that I didn't agree with him."
As a Nets fan who has grown tired of Kyrie these last few weeks I wish they could trade him to Minny for D’Lo.   Minny would obviously take the risk of gaining Kyrie for 2yrs since when he’s on the court he’s an amazing player. If Kyrie retires then Minny clears the $ off their books.   Nets would get D’Lo who can at least play PG since who knows how many games Kyrie will miss.   Any trade for Durant would have to include DeAndre Jordan.   No way the Nets keep a washed up Jordan making $10m a year for another 2yrs if Kyrie and Durant don’t work out.   Nets would have no $ for Free Agents even if Kyrie randomly retired so trading him before would be the best thing Sean Marks could do.
Playing deandre Jordan a lot 😔
idk i just dont want to have to watch deandre jordan when we (hopefully) play you guys in the finals
"nets need to trade deandre jordan, cash considerations, and some TPEs for drummond"
"This was year one when DeAndre Jordan was hitting Luka on the head to take uncontested rebounds &amp; Dennis Smith Jr was moping because Luka is a little better than him at basketball so we had to make moves.   I like our team now, we’ve made good moves. We have 6 key rotation players out today, let’s judge the team on a larger body of work"
Prime Deandre Jordan &gt;&gt;&gt; Steph
deandre easily. I see capela doing some work out of post ups from time to time. Jordan is only lobs.
Do you think the Nets can trade DeAndre Jordan (KD and Kyrie forced Nets to sign him) or Dinwiddie (injured)?
"Malone played 36.2 mpg in 81 games the season before, averaging 20.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.7 steals for a 47-win playoff team.  Obviously he wasn't near his peak anymore, but I wouldn't say washed (current DeAndre Jordan is washed, Malone wasn't that)."
Like 5 of them should’ve been easy lobs to DeAndre Jordan that got intercepted because he can’t jump.
Please stop  He’s DeAndre Jordan
These are going to be the usual stats for any decent stretch 5 against Deandre Jordan. All the threes Vuc took were wide open.
"What gave you this impression? Even when harden and kd went off for 84pts on 50/40/90 splits they bearly won against the garbage magic without fultz, fournier and isaac. That team cant defend, has no depth and its only C is deandre fucking jordan. If this shitshow gets past a healthy philly in PO it would be a real shocker.  Btw kyrie will add nothig to that dynamic. Harden and KD alone can do everythigmng kyrie could potentialy add....well maby he will add his usual dramay whi knows."
"&gt; And if the flat earther plays along they could be taking it all.  That guy worries me more than KD or Harden. And DeAndre Jordan. KD/Kyrie should've never LeGM'd to get him on the team b/c he's a buddy... if push comes to shove they're going to regret it. He's so washed. I can't believe the Nets traded Allen AND another player just to get the Cavs FRP (that they got from the Bucks) to do the deal. With the way Allen's been playing, he + another rotational player should be worth more than a FRP."
I get that 2020 Clippers energy from this quote. Now we need DeAndre Jordan to say the next 5 years are his.
"You can't just change the goalposts and act like that's what the discussion was about.  &gt;Lopez, Jokic, Boucher, Gasol ---- if they are being left WIDE OPEN on EVERY SHOT --- then it's more common than it should be  your reply was;   &gt;Gasol is not going to make them please stop. He looks about as washed as DeAndre Jordan on offense.  My point is that if Gasol was given 12 wide open 3 point shots, it's not too crazy to say he could hit half of them. I'm not trying to argue that he will make 7 in a game because he rarely even gets close to that many attempts lmao"
"They don’t have the personnel to compete? No they only have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Do you honestly believe what you write..? You could argue their center position is very weak with an aging DeAndre Jordan and a few rookies. Nonetheless they have great defenders otherwise with Harden and Bruce Brown as positive defensive guards. Joe Harris and Landry Shamet also help space the floor. The farthest the Sixers ever recently been was with Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick on their roster. You won’t even convince Sixers fans today that their current team is better than during that ‘18-‘19 season."
"Please let’s not let DAJ be the way to identify DeAndre Jordan lol. Back when he was good, he’d be referred to as DJ"
"You re saying it like Lakers have bad defenders on their team which KD,Harden,Kyrie can switch on and cook.If we meet them in the finals,we would probably start Caruso-KCP-Matthews-Lebron-AD.None of them are bad indiviual defenders.Caruso,Matthews and KCP can stay on Harden &amp; Kyrie.Lebron and AD can stay on Durant.I'd trust AD if he's defending Kyrie or Harden btw.Sure,those 3 will still get their points but you are not going to win a series like that.Not when those isos arent going to be too easy.  The Nets don't have a rim protector,this is like a death sentence against LeBron if you dont have a great 1 on 1 defender on him.KD is a good defender but he can't slow him down like Kawhi and PG did in the past.Lebron can easily take on Kyrie,Harden,Joe Harris,Deandre Jordan and cook all of them.He'll get to the rim everytime.  Lakers dont really have a weakness,while the Nets do."
"Given what the assets have become then yes, honestly. DSJ imploded in New York, Matthews and Deandre Jordan declined quickly, we are too good for the 2021 pick to be in the high lottery and 2023 pick is protected.   THJ has been amazing for us which is a huge plus."
Gasol is not going to make them please stop. He looks about as washed as DeAndre Jordan on offense.
"Just because you have AD and LeBron and good players, that doesn't make you a super team.  Westbrook / Harden Rockets wasn't a super team  CP3 / Harden wasn't a super team  CP3 / peak Griffin / Peak DeAndre / Reddick/Crawford wasn't a super team   Kyrie / Tatum /Brown / Hayward wasn't a super team  Giannis / Middleton / Jrue isn't a super team  Shaq / Kobe Lakers wasn't a superteam  AD/LeBron Lakers aren't a super team  The 73 win Warriors wasn't a super team. It was a perfect assembled team    Superteams that succeeded   Russell Celtics  Magic Lakers  Bird Celtics   Jordan 2nd threepeat  Heatles  Celtics Rondo, KG, Pierce, Allen  KD,Steph, Draymond, Klay GSW     Superteams that don't succeeded  Moses, DR J, Barkley, Cheeks  Deron, Brook Lopez, Old KG and Pierce, Kirilenko, Joe Johnson  Lakers Kobe, Shaq, Payton and Malone  LakersDwight, Gasol, Nash, Kobe, Artest   Westbrook, Melo, Paul George, Adams    New and only super team currently   Kyrie, KD, Harden"
"Who are the nets 4-8 vs Lakers 4-8? Massive difference considering DeAndre Jordan is washed, and I've never heard of any of the Nets players other than Shamet.  Lakers have Caruso and KCP (both top 5 in 3 pt) and 2 6MOY, and Marc Gasol. Kuzma isnt nearly as good of a 3rd option as Kyrie, but Kyrie hasnt been playing so...   Idk I have a hard time saying the nets depth isnt the worst in the league"
"Yeah Harden does great with rim-rolling centers, Deandre Jordan would've been the perfect center to put next to Harden if he was just a few years younger and more athletic"
"Man, what the fudge is going on with Deandre Jordan? Dude is on the decline. You thought losing weight would make you more efficient"
"The biggest problem with the defense wasn’t even the defense, it was just DeAndre Jordan having no idea how to play basketball anymore"
"How though? They have no assets they’d trade, besides maybe joe Harris and no picks for the foreseeable future. They’ll be the biggest team in the buyout market but I can’t imagine them pulling off a trade that nets than an upgrade over deandre Jordan"
Because life is about who you know and DeAndre Jordan knows KD and Kyrie.
The only problem with this team is DeAndre Jordan.
This team will only go as far as the big man rotation will be.  DeAndre Jordan will be the reason the Nets can't get to the finals.
DeAndre Jordan for Drummond. Who says no?
Okay well also throw in Deandre Jordan to sweeten the deal
"If Drummond wasn't making so much, it would be nice to see DeAndre Jordan+salary fillters+second rounders for Drummond."
DeAndre Jordan is our center
Deandre jordan was the best player tonight. Dude scored like 40 points for the magic
I'm more impressed with the magic being competitive in the game missing mutiple key players. Also DeAndre Jordan is terrible.
DeAndre Jordan is washed
"Yea, I picked guys that were fast too. It’s not like I’m picking Deandre Jordan or anything. All of these players are great at finishes, blocking shots, and finishing lobs"
"Nets trade: Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan   Cavaliers trade: Colin Sexton, Jared Allen    wsn?"
3 of those are because of Deandre Jordan being trash
nah deandre jordan is
Deandre Jordan exists
Deandre Jordan is the laziest unskilled player in the NBA
Not even Harden can get Deandre Jordan to score. That should tell you all you need to know.
How is it harden’s fault that deandre jordan sucks
"Have you watched the game? If you had, you'd realize the reason why Magic are scoring a lot is because DeAndre Jordan is a secret agent."
"Why won't Deandre Jordan, the biggest Net, eat the other Nets?"
"nets need to trade deandre jordan, cash considerations, and some TPEs for andre drummond"
Deandre jordan 20 minutes 2 points 4 rebounds
deandre jordan is the reason we’re winning this right now
I don't understand how Deandre Jordan is expected to play any playoff minutes
Deandre Jordan wouldn’t even be in the NBA if it weren’t for KD. He’s bad at everything
Please trade DeAndre Jordan before all the GMs realize how ass he is
What does Deandre Jordan do well?
the east looking at deandre jordan and licking their lips
"Dedmon potential, but a sneaky one i'd like to see is Drummond. They could trade Spencer and DeAndre for him, but they have no additional assets for him.   Harden needs a quick lengthy guy to PnR with. Jordan is way too slow."
DeAndre Jordan is not very good anymore... might get ugly when they have to play Embiid
"We were wondering if it would be Kyrie, KD, or Harden taking the last second shots, but Steve Nash big brained us and has DeAndre Jordan taking them"
DeAndre Jordan is pretty washed
"People really need to cherish KAT/Embiid/Jokic for entering the league bc the C position was in so much poverty, that we had to give All NBA to Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond"
Man Im just wondering who the hell they’re playing at C lol.  Deandre Jordan shouldn’t play more than 15 mins a game.
"I don't know, maybe my opinion changes once I see them all play together.  We just have no defence and no depth. Our centre is DeAndre Jordan, lol. Like I don't really know what we have for the Bucks, and the Lakers look so fucking good already."
DeAndre Jordan dunk
"Imagine being the Nets, having three superstars, and still not winning the championship because DeAndre Jordan is the team’s best defender"
"Clippers were a top 10 defense last season and their defense got exposed because 2/3 bad defensive players were in their rotation. Now imagine if most of the players in your rotation are poor defenders and the rim protection duties, the most important defense in the league, is in the hands of DeAndre Jordan? It's a very big problem."
"Hmmmmm idk I think it will be a big problem. Deandre jordan is pretty washed.  They have pretty much no assets to trade now but they are the most attractive team for any bigman on the buyout market. I'm not too sure who that might be yet but I'm sure they will be looking. Maybe they will play really good team defense and it won't be as big of a deal, I guess we just gotta wait and see 🤷‍♂️"
"Yea by players like Kawhi, Gasol, Ibaka, Jimmy Buckets, and Bam not a washed up DeAndre Jordan."
"There's zero centers good enough to defend Giannis, AD or Embiid. But there will be centers better than DeAndre Jordan and whoever else the Nets have right now."
"How? Trading away defense and rebounding for more iso? Losing depth and bench scoring for a more top heavy playstyle? I’m not convinced. They’re 3 generational iso players but there’s only 1 basketball.  I may be biased but they aren’t beating the Lakers, and certainly aren’t now. Clamping 2 guards won’t be difficult for us. KD is a problem but they gave up their best rebounder for ANOTHER iso scorer, and one who doesn’t play off ball well. They’re gonna get destroyed on the offensive boards with DeAndre Jordan being their only center - he’s about the most one dimensional center there is left and Jarrett Allen was way better in of a scorer, rebounder, defender and shooter."
