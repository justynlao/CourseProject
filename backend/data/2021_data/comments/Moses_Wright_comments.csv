Jokic is great but he won't be remembered by casuals so Nick is kinda Wright. I think he's better than Moses Malone tho
"I wonder what the next domino to fall will be.  Surely Boston won't be keeping all four of Rob/Horford/Tristan/Moses and paying 35mil to backup centers.  It might be Rob as part of a big move trade package and/or if they can't get an extension worked out, or maybe Tristan and a 2nd or two to get a player on a similar salary.  I'd love to somehow get Delon Wright out of him."
"Hawks: Wright, Lou, Reddish, Gallo, okongwu, huerter, dieng   Sixers: Milton, Korkmaz, thybulle, Maxey, Scott, Drummond  Knicks: Rose, Burks, Quickley, Toppin, Noel, Gibson  Mavs: Burke, Kleber, Brunson, bullock, WCS, Moses  Grizzlies: Allen, Melton, Bledsoe, Bane, Tillman, Clarke"
"I swear we haven’t had a Moses in the league since Moses Malone and now we about to have 3 Moses of Brown, Moody and Wright"
Plus the Sixers got Sharon Wright - the next Moses. Team is looking nice.
"Yeah, for sure. That first half was just Luka throwing the ball away trying to get everyone involved. For all the bullshit and bad vibes Rick gave off, he didn't ever veer from the fact that Luka needed the greenest of all lights for the team to really flourish. And yes, I get that there's a gravity argument (AKA teams are gonna simply gameplan around Luka and force him to pass) and ALSO a fatigue argument (AKA we saw what happened in the playoffs when Luka had to do everything and ran out of gas in the 4th), BUT that doesn't change the fact that Luka has to score. Period. The guy needs to get in his rhythm and not worry about making everyone else feel peachy.   I don't know if any other new coach would take us a different way, because it's clear that Luka needed help. Like, taking the weight off him was gonna be the gameplan regardless of the coach.   And that leads us to the most frustrating element of all this, the clear argument that has been beaten to death on every podcast and article and season preview----**For the Mavs to be good, KP has to fuckin step up.** The guy looks awkward when he gets the ball and lost when he doesn't have it. He gets the ball taken away when he faces up and he dribbles the thing up to his fuckin chin. IDK what to make of it. I watched him in NY (shit, we all did). He was confident. He was fluid. He played loose and without abandon. All his injuries suck, and I'm sure that those are playing a role in his timid style atm, BUT STILL, the dude has to fucking step up.   Some thoughts on KP specifically (since i'm drunk and feeling it now): --Stop hanging around the perimeter ON DEFENSE. The dude is getting switched out and then just staying there. He's gotta be the weakside stronghold, even after the switch. There were two or three plays tonight where he got switched out on to Delon Wright and then just let Reddish and Hunter blow by their defender without sliding back and making an easy block. Delon Wright? Dude hasn't made a three since Moses was lacing up his sandals...  --GET LOWER. This is what pains me after watching Dirk my entire life. Dirk was skinny. He was awkward and lanky and sometimes goofy looking. But when Dirk got the ball, nobody pushed him around, because he stuck his ass out like he was Cardi-Fuckin-B. Holger taught him all those footwork and positioning drills because if he hadn't, he woulda just become what KP is now--WEAK. The dude has got to push some folks around and create space. How many times did KP get his jumper blocked tonight? 3? 4? And how many times we ever see Dirk get his jumper blocked? Like once or twice over a 20 year career? He knew how to position his body and get space. KP, right now, gets the ball and stands STRAIGHT UP. Anybody who's ever played any sport understands the ""Athletic Position,"" but apparently KP has never heard of it.   --Stop lolly-gaggin around waiting to set a screen and diving at the wrong moments. For all of KP's shooting prowess, he dives at the EXACT WRONG times and clogs the offense. It's like, so fucked. There was a play where he ran Collins straight into Luka on a drive, and Luka go fouled, looking supremely frustrated, but honestly I couldn't tell if he was upset at the ref, at Collins, or at KP for not having the awareness to no clog the lane when it's a easy lay-up.   Damn...sorry u/checkm8300. I got way off there. You're right. That's all I was tryna say.  Anyhow, shitty loss. I want Kidd to succeed because I want the Mavs to succeed.   Everyone, including myself, just have a drink, meditate, smoke something, whatever you do to feel better. It's a long season, so let's hope this is our lowest point."
Oh. Moses Wright has a future.
moses wright
"WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT BARNES! We could’ve resigned he and KP and just been over the cap then trotted out Luka/THJ/DFS/Barnes/KP with Jalen, maxi, Dwight Powell etc off the bench. I guess we don’t get to sign Seth and Delon Wright if we don’t trade Barnes, but those guys got traded for Josh richardson who turned into Moses brown and a trade exception we won’t use and Delon Wright was turned into James Johnson who turned into JJ Redick who turned into nothing. Yay"
"Moses ""GET YO MEME PLAYER OUT MY COURT"" Wright."
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."
