Where's Patty Mills?
Patty Mills
At the end of the day it’s what he chose as his delegation. If we want to play semantics none of these players bar patty mills are Australian bc they’re not First Nations people. Australia is weird like that.
Maybe they can trade for the GOAT towel-waiver: Patty Mills.
There was a spurs twitter account getting roasted for their take saying If patty mills was two inches taller we would be talking about him in the same breathe as Steph Curry on twitter lol
Patty mills is a fiba god. Cant imagin whats his going to do in the Olympics
that's 'Patty Fucking Mills' as he's known in my house
I will always be a patty mills fan and now I’m a Keldon fan.
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
"rpm says cj is the 2nd most impactful and and lonzo ball is the 14th most impactful and patty mills is the 15th most impactful. If you understood why the numbers are what they are for conley, which is the fact that he shares nearly all of his minutes with gobert, you'd understand why his RAPTOR is so inflated.  poetl also has played so few minutes, pointless to even care about what raptor says about him."
It’s like the “G’DAY MATE” we get every time Patty Mills hits a 3
"U got a great reason, this is way better than some bs bias  I dislike Patty Mills for the same reason, missed a few open threes last season to lose me like 2 grand"
I mean he was on the court with Patty Mills not long ago so there's that instance
I always assume Patty Mills is going to sink 10 threes against us.
Losing when Patty is struggljng. Patty Mills MVP confirmed.
"yup our development of guys that other teams cut shows the player development aspect.   guys like patty mills, gary neal, danny green, aaron baynes, etc. were all nobodies and ended up playing a huge role in the playoffs"
"oh yea I forgot about them! People that come to mind include:  1) Aaron Baynes who we brought over from Australia and literally no one had heard of him  2) Patty Mills - never really played any meaningful minutes in portland and now is one of the best 6th men in the league  3) Danny Green - got cut from a really bad cleveland team, now is one of the premier 3 &amp; D guys in the league  4) Boban - enough said"
"Demar's been in all star form in each season with Spurs, its jus now the players around him are better, he doesn't have to over exert himself tryna carry, gets more assists.  Aldridge is still an incredible shooter, has done good to hit more 3s, but is atrocious on d. Poetle is exceptional on d but terrible at shooting. Centre is our weakest position and typically we lose to teams with good big men.  Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray have both been incredible, could both be in the convo for MIP. Vassell looks great but still gets less minutes being a rookie. That said wouldn' be surprised if he takes more minutes from Lonnie Walker once our star pg Derrick White is healthy.  Patty FIBA Mills. Patty fucking Mills. Is a solid candidate for 6th man of the year. Been playing out his skin this year.  So yeah peeps might stop sleepin on us soon. There's weaknesses to the team, youth can be inconsistent, but they play with so much heart. So much fun to watch."
I love Patty Mills
clipper killer patty mills
"Rudy Gay would be the best bench scorer and versatile defender on a lot of teams, is expiring, and isn’t too much money to match   Same for Patty mills minus the defense"
Yankee Patty needs to chill out. There's only room for one Patty Mills.
Really glad I was able to add American Patty Mills in my fantasy league.
Fucking Yankee Patty Mills.
AMERICAN PATTY MILLS
Gary Trent look like Patty Mills
This fucking patty mills look a like is killing us right now.
American Patty Mills going stupid
"There's no way you can compare the spurs to the wizards lol. The spurs have dejounte Murray, derozan, Aldridge, keldon johnson, two good veterans in patty mills and rudy gay, as well as promising young talent in Lonnie walker and derrick white. The spurs roster is WAY better than the wizards."
"&gt; murray is a way better defender than mills  Understatement of the century. On defense, Dejounte is a huge plus and Patty is a massive minus."
Patty Mills has gone color blind mid game
"lmfao ""MVP frontrunner"" Nikola Jokic all the way down at #34  man he really is so important to his team, just as important as MVP contenders Caruso, Jakob Poetl and Patty Mills!"
"I mean Patty Mills is having his best season so far at 12 ,but I get what you’re saying.No human is meant to be the best player in the league at year 18"
"I honestly cant wait for next season. Hoping that we make a run at an athletic big like Collins or Allen. Our young guys aren't quite ready to have the reins turned over to them yet, but good grief is it miserable watching Aldridge and DeMar together. Then to add insult to injury, watching Rudy Gay and Patty Mills sub in for them and play hero ball for the next 10 minutes."
patty mills and devin vassell   the spurs are dominating this list lol. spots 2-5 are all spurs combos
"Our best line ups seem to feature Jakob and with the scoring we have already- it’s a better fit to have a glass cleaner and shot blocker at the center position    The obvious fix is start Jak, give him 30 minutes a game, and let Lamarcus come in when the opposing teams best players sit and just let him and Patty mills go hard as fuck on pick and pop action. Patty, Rudy, Lamarcus would destroy benches."
"I really like Demar, but he is struggling with the clutch. He is asked to create something and usually he gets locked up and is forced into a bad shot. I’d rather give patty mills the ball there and have him make something happen"
Yeah dude was dropping 30 point double doubles on the regular like two seasons ago.Now he’s getting out rebounded by Patty mills
And Patty Mills
thanks for putting patty mills on him
Patty Mills is our best defender atm.  Props to him.
"Patty Mills, and Mike Conley(he is good) but plays like Curry against us. And any young guard that’s playing because someone’s hurt."
Patty Mills with defense
Patty Mills
the fake patty mills on the blazers went super saiyan god super saiyan against us and has been ass cheeks ever since
"Patty Mills: That’s not a knife. THIS, is a knife  Curry: That’s a spoon  Mills: Ah right, you win. I see you played knife-spooney before"
It's okay. You weren't as lost as Patty Mills
Patty Mills literally went like 0-8 from 3
Patty Mills just cannot miss the last game I saw the Spurs play... today is a different story...
"the Warriors stream on League Pass is completely broken but the Spurs one works.  I was really enjoying Fitz and Kelenna shit-talking each other but the real issue here is that if Patty Mills hits a three and I, an Australian, have to hear the Spurs commentators say ""G'day, mate!"" I regret to inform you that our nations will be at war"
Someone check Patty Mills’ ankles after that
Patty Mills is fucking good
"It's all Patty Mills. He's setting league records, playing better than Curry right now"
"And hey, Patty Mills."
"How old is Patty Mills? If you told me he was 25 or 35, I'd believe you either way"
Patty Mills
"Yeah, Mills just generally turns into Steph Curry when [he puts on the Boomer green n gold.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2PYgTfOnhk)  Patty Mills - [30 pts vs Team USA, 2019 - ending America's 78-game winning streak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ33qLfkD4o)  Also -   JC Navarro [21 vs Team USA, 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwSfaZGNnxk) - he was often the best player on Team Spain, even though they had the Gasols, Rubio, Ibaka  Sarunas Jasikevicius - [28 pts vs Team USA, 2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMupHyjP-58) - probably one of the most hyped Euros to ever come over  [Sofoklis ""Baby Shaq"" Schortsanitis vs Team USA, 2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-hhEQEkP0s"
Best: Patty Mills
"Hard to say but probably Patty Mills and everyone  DJ and LMA had a pure bromance moment last year when LMA scored 52 and DJ interrupted the post game interview and said something like ""Allstar? Allstar? this dude's a superstar!"", it was real cute"
"He won't start him because the it's just him and Norm carrying the bench. Take that away to beef up starting lineup and we'll be worse off overall The strategy is to start small or put in Baynes/Len as place holders until Boucher can come in against the opposing bench and give us a boost.  A 6 man like Lou Will, Patty Mills or Schoeder, Harrell or Harden in OKC is typically good enough to start. It's not just  because  ""Nurse doesn't really like him"""
Patty. God. Damn. Mills
Bruh yall beat us too. Patty Mills was unconscious that game
Gary Trent is Patty Mills’ Wario
"Demar being on teams which like a solid bench is not unfortunate.   Patty Mills going aggressive, Rudy Gay playing well sometimes and Vassell playing awesome defense helps us because our starting lineup isn’t getting us to the playoffs or even the play-in by themselves"
Yeah but we have Patty Mills and Rudy Gay who are the 19th and 21st best players in the league.
Patty Mills and Gary Trent Jr look like they could be brothers
Patty Mills has to be like 60 in American years
Patty Mills for 6MOTY
God down a bunch of players and just what we need is fucking rudy gay and patty mills of all people hitting every shot
Gary Trent is Patty Mills’ Wario
PATTY MELT MILLS
"I'm late, did someone already make a joke about both Patty Mills being on the court at the same time?"
Patty Mills gonna go off?
"For a while, warriors fans pretended like Patty Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge were dirty players in an obvious attempt to make it seem like what Zaza did wasn't dirty."
"Patty Mills and Simmons are literally polar opposites, helluva 1-2 punch. I wouldn't bet on them but I wouldn't be surprised to see them win a medal. They'd just have to avoid any team with a better superstar. Like England getting to the semi final in the world cup,"
"Patty Mills, Eric Gordon, and JJ Barea"
I was wanting Patty Mills to get it but after this I can’t deny it
Patty Mills &amp; Keldon Johnson  (until Derrick White’s back)

True...or how about Patty Mills?
"They have some decent young players just none of all star caliber. I think they will be in the lottery again but they will also have \~50 mil in cap space next year as Rudy Gay, Derozan, LA and Patty Mills all have expiring contracts. They could trade those guys for assets or use the money in Free agency. Mills especially looks prime as a trade piece for a contender who needs a guard that can shoot 40% from 3."
Patty Mills is giving off strong 1980s aerobic video vibes.
Better than Patty Mills and Bryn Forbes? please

It’ll be an interesting race. I think Patty Mills has a shot at it too if Pop keeps on giving him the green light. He’s shooting .506/.569/.938  14.7 ppg in 25.1 min.
Patty Mills might be the GOAT backup PG.
"People always been on about the free throw differential but its not the point this game  Watch the game over again and tell me that Dejounte Murray, Lamarcus Aldridge and Patty Mills weren't fouled more often then what they got? A combined 2 FTs between the 3. The refs refused to give it both ways this game."
Of course Spurs beat Lakers then lose to Wolves ... Of course Patty Mills decide to go cold from 3 against non-Lakers ...
Timberwolves annoucer: “Patty Mills is really good at rubbing defenders off........ in ball screen action.”
Patty Mills deserves it more lol. No unless LMA somehow drags us to a finals win this year it’s not happening
Patty mills and Rudy gay are two of the best bench scorers in basketball
"Patty Mills for sure, averaging a career high in points at around 15 PPG, shooting 57% from 3 this year on 6 attempts a game. At 13M mill a year, I could see a lot of contenders looking at picking him up in the off-season. If I was the clippers, I’d see if I could pull him as a Lou Will replacement"
"At the London Olympics in 2012, who averaged the most points?  LeBron?  KD?  Kobe?  No, it was Patty ""Millionaire"" Mills.  Dude is a baller."
Patty Mills from Straya mate
"the GOAT shooter, revolutionized the game, curry is #2 to him  Patty Mills"
Mills getting hot. Call it a Patty Melt
Patty Mills is one of the most entertaining players of all time and easily the most entertaining of this generation  Title says it all. After watching the All Star Game I realized how boring the last 10 years would have been if not for Patty Mills. Lebron would have won every finals and everyone would still be dunking. This man changed the game forever and did it with a smile on his face. He's one of the few players that looks like he genuinely enjoys the game of basketball for what it is. A game.
Patty Mills if he averaged 35 min instead of 25.
I would think Patty Mills could dunk...
"Thybulle is a stud defensive prospect, his ceiling could realistically be like, Marcus Smart. Trading him for 32 year old Patty Mills would be incredibly short sighted."
Patty Mills has been a valuable player ever since he lit up the Redeem Team in 08. He could easily play the FVV role on most contenders in the league. He’s worth at least a late first. Maybe more.
It’s essentially 3 headlines in one. The boston 3 are as stated above. Then the aussie part is about patty mills going to spurs rivals. Then part 3 is scattered trade rumors
"If you are trading your 2021 draft pick, then there is no saving it for another player. Unless its a draft day trade.   The 76ers for instance could trade their FRP for Patty Mills. Otherwise, it'll just be a pick in the late 20s."
is it possible that “Pattythrillzz” might value Patty Mills a little too much
There’s literally zero chance patty mills is getting traded for a second round pick
"The Bucks were interested in Patty Mills in the offseason but signed DJ Augustin instead, which sucks because Augustin is fucking trash and is damn near untradeable."
ONE PATTY MILLS PLZ!
Doubt Pop let’s Patty Mills get traded unless he plans on retiring this offseason
One Rudy Gay and Patty Mills please
Plus patty mills
"Guard Patty Mills yelled out ""We got an [expletive] squad now mate!"""
"“According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Spurs are taking calls on LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Trey Lyles and Patty Mills ahead of the March 25 trade deadline.”"
Me and someone on here came up with a Josh Richardson for Seth curry fake trade like 12 hours before it happened on here lol but I didn’t actually think he would be available either   Would you do either of these   Thybulle mike Scott and whatever other matching salary for Patty Mills  Thybulle and a 2nd round pick or two for Devonte Graham
Minnesota should make an offer for JOhn Collins   Shams last month said asking price was a lower level lottery pick  Time for my annual patty mills to the sixers fake trades that’ll never happen
&gt; The Spurs are receiving calls on [...] Patty Mills  Daryl plz
So you’re telling me that’s not Patty Mills on the Blazers?
"I think a lot of people would be surprised by how athletic a lot of guys are. I recently saw this patty Mills pregame dunk and thought it was odd to see considering he's never dunked in a game before.  https://youtu.be/fJRWKKRolJ8  since I'm thinking about it, here's a tiny parker dunk too, but this one's in game and doesn't have an ass angle.  https://youtu.be/pvdR6b6hwek"
!!!!!!!!!!!Patty Mills HOLY CHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Patty Mills   TJ McConnell  Ish Smith   Vucevic (some games he actually never misses its crazy)  Actually on a tangent, HOW FUCKING GOOD IS VOOCH?   Absolute stud man, looks like a pretty chill guy too. When he posts up and drops that right shoulder it’s fucking curtains, such a soft touch around the rim. Not bad on a basketball court either."
I don't think Patty Mills has ever missed a shot against us
Patty Mills and Gary Trent Jr
This game was over when Patty Mills hit that three to end the first half lol
patty mills decided to change careers to pirate in the offseason
PATTY MELT MILLS!!!
Patty Mills is smaller than that lady ref
More interesting one patty mills is having a career year and I think someone could overpay him even to start
"Last night I saw Hernangomez come and immediately the first thing Webber says about him is “I wanna what his paella game is like” like seriously dude?  The Spurs play by play guy does shit like that too with some foreign players - the worst was when Marco Belinelli would hit a big shot, he’d say in a very obnoxiously stereotypical Italian accent “now thatsa spicy a meatball!!!”   He still does the “g’day mate” with Patty Mills."
"Except it wont. Its just called a double dribble here because refs think patty mills didnt fumble it. Whether he did or not, im not sure tbh but theres definitely a decent chance thats what happened"
"don’t know why patty mills helped on the horford drive, but he did."
"True but it was by design, the Spurs has no choice but to bring a man out to half court to guard the thunder player out of vision.  Patty Mills was on Dort but he had to go to the paint to stop the ball on Horford because he beat his man."
Why is nobody blaming Patty Mills? He lost them the game with this play.
Pop just lost to Patty Mills.
Why’d Patty Mills commit so hard to the drive😂
Patty Mills TO and help D
Well it sure is raining shit on Patty Mills right now
No way!   Joe Ingles? Patty Mills? Aron Baynes? Hugh Jackman? Steve Irwin?
"I’d honestly be down to explore Horford as an option   Barnes seems to be the main target within the Cs subreddit but some other names tossed around    Terrence Ross, Devonte Graham, Alec Burkes, George Hill, Patty Mills, Danuel House, Wayne Ellington, Thad Young, PJ Tucker   pretty slim pickings tbh"
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
Patty Mills!
"On the topic of great commercials, the Dynasty Spurs with Kawhi, LMA and Patty Mills ones are GOATed"
"Steve Novak, Patty Mills, Ricky Rubio, JJ Redick, Troy Daniels, TJ McConnell, DJ Augustin, and FVV"
"Your English is great!  Pop has done this with a lot of players.  He learned about indigenous people's day and bonded with Patty Mills over it, giving Mills a platform to talk about it during a team meeting. He hosted a screening for 2016's Birth of a Nation, a movie about a slave rebellion partially funded by Tony Parker.  He traveled with Manu to visit his hometown in Argentina. He stayed a few days in St. Croix with Duncan before the NBA draft.    He really values personal connections and seems to go out of his way to learn about his players' cultures, interests, initiatives, etc."
"RPM also has Devonte Graham 14th, ahead of Kawhi, KD, AD, Kyrie, Gobert, Beal, CP3, etc.  Just so you know it isn't just that one outlier, Lonzo is 16th, Patty Mills 24th, PatBev 33rd, Cam Payne 34th, and Muscala 37th.  RPM is fucked and nobody uses it anymore."
Ok here we go : - Patty Mills warm up dunk : https://youtu.be/fJRWKKRolJ8  - JJ Reddick : https://youtu.be/V0JnL74D8TU  - Ricky Rubio : https://youtu.be/05ace2B1GNU  And just for the pleasure : - Chris Paul on Dwight Howard : https://youtu.be/UDjzvJYWtoc  - Tony Parker : https://youtu.be/pvdR6b6hwek
Lmao:)  Honestly the worst so far was Mann getting a 3 taken away some random game like 2 weeks ago.  His foot was out of bounds but there was no call and like 1 quarter later it was just gone.  We lost by 3 or 4 too.  It's every team and officiating this year but i still feel violated after last night.  That was next level and really the culmination those 3 games of the Zebra's.  I doubt anything will change though unless a player finally Kermit Washington's an official.  The league doesn't care.    Kings fans i will always be emphatic towards after last night tbh.  My PTSD to 2nd round 3-1 chokes and Patty Mills killing us for decades are very real and painful but i cannot imagine their pain everytime a whistle blows cause last night relly broke me.  I have no desire to watch our next game or nba for a bit and i've supported us since the Larry Brown days.
"patty Mills gets some of the ""savviest"" fouls of anyone on our team, but you love him for it as a sixth man. it gets a bit tougher when people are doing it ten times a fucking game. if PG wanted to, he could play soft as hell, and I respect that he doesn't."
Michael Porter Jr and Patty Mills.
"Devin Vassell is playing great defense already. He has struggled against some of the stronger players but very rarely makes a mistake. He's already a much better defender than Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, and Patty Mills. Offensively he has hit his catch and shoot shots well and made the occasional athletic play. He has some moves to create shots of his own off the dribble but he's not great at it and isn't a good passer. He's doing pretty great I'd say. I imagine he'll get a much bigger offensive role in a few years and will improve his defense has gets stronger.  Tre Jones has been playing well in the G league and has barely played in the NBA. It's clear he knows how to play but if his shooting doesn't improve, I don't know how useful he will be."
Vassell - gets time but isn't guaranteed to be getting time when the team is full. He is all we expected him to be and shows potential to be much more.  Tre - Pop doesn't give him any time as he is on G-League. I'd say he should definitely take Patty Mills' spot because he is a better playmaker and defender.
"I cannot understand WHY does defense get overlooked so much when it is HALF the game lol.  How can Brooklyn even compete with Lakers when it's ""Big 3 vs Big 2"" BUT the 2 best defenders are on the Lakers side. So really it's Big 3 vs Big 4, and then the Lakers are much deeper bench wise. So I can't see the Nets winning maybe give them 20 percent chance but it's doubtful that series even goes 7 games.  Now who COULD be the team to upset Lakers???  In the Finals you could see Miami Heat upset the Lakers if Butler is Butler, Bam is Bam, and the supporting cast all shoots 40+ percent from 3 plus they keep up their ELITE DEF in the playoffs like last season. BAM with experience is scary he could match AD possibly, Jimmy can maybe even match an aging LeBron, so it might be cast vs cast and the Heat could have the slight edge if healthy with Precious Achiuwa the difference maker the X factor.  The SPURS??? Yes with Pop coaching and Tim Duncan experience beating the Lakers they can school the young Spurs how to beat the Lakers. Duncan knows how to get inside LeBron head he almost beat him 3 times in the finals. So yes they know LeBron secrets....and then you have the Big 3 of Dejounte, Derozan and LMA who are all very complimentary players. Murray is a DEF beast, Derozan is a leader, and LMA is a Vet. Not to mention the depth of guys like Gay, and Poetl and PATTY MILLS  The Sixers are the BEST team in the NBA this year. They have the MOST depth and the best players. The problem is coaching. Doc Rivers is a choke artist with the Clippers and Celtics. The 2008 win was in spite of him. Awful coach the guy doesn;t have a clue what he's doing out there.  So will the Lakers beat them?? Yes easily only because Doc Stinks. If Phil Jackson was coaching this Sixers team they EASILY win the chip. Embiid &gt; AD, and the Combo of Simmons/Tobias is good enough to match LeBron. Simmons on DEF and transition offense and Tobias with the clutch shooting like his game winner to beat Lakers this year."
I just realize this guy isn't Patty Mills
&amp;#x200B;  Patty Mills? JJ Barea?
Patty Mills
"Those are crazy lofty expectations for a literal teenager. Nobody expected that out of Ayton, Zion, Fultz, etc. Sure there's exceptions like Doncic or Ja Morant but there's a reason teams like the spurs and heat keep guys around a long time like Patty Mills and Udonis Haslem."

"Also do not forget Patty Mills! But yeah, Clarkson is easily the 6MOTY"
Patty mills probably the closest lol.
"&gt; but none are on such a successful team as Clarkson  Clarkson is my top pick by far, but Patty Mills is on a successful team that is on the upward trend as well as another solid good stats + winning team combination."
Patty Mills - team is winning as well.
baynes got 37 w/ the suns last year  I believe before that it was patty mills w/ 34 from the 2012 season  and before that was bogut with 32 from 2010
i really want Patty Mills to be recognized by the league in some way eventually. The man has epitomized being an actual sixth man for basically his entire career. Such a great person on the court and off the court.
"Patty Mills had a good run at it, but this is Clarkson’s award"
"Yeah I you hit the nail on the head, their defence has been much better.

"Not gonna lie, from the video thumbnail I thought that was Patty Mills. 😳"
Guest witness: Patty Mills
I agree with a the others but Patty Mills makes a strong case for 6moty as well
 20-22 minutes for patty. He's playing about 26 right now because we are not staggering derrick and dj to handle point. Patty becomes defacto pg when they are out and usually demar is out by that time too.  Mills is deadly coming off screens and shooting immediately not initiating pnr to a 3 pt shot. He's not bad there but not great either.
Is Patty Mills the best backup PG in the league?
Patty Mills
"The bench from the beautiful game (2011/2014) Spurs were so good, maybe not the most impressive individually but they were winning them a ton of games (well actually Patty Mills and the current bench still do nowadays)"
"Do you think any teams are trading a first for Patty Mills, George Hill, Mike Muscala, or PJ Tucker? Keep in mind, a decent chunk of contenders don’t even have any firsts to trade for years since they used them to acquire stars (Lakers, Clippers, Nets, Bucks, etc.)  These guys are pretty much all expiring vets on non-contenders. If they’re not getting traded for 1sts, what do you think those teams are going to take for them?"
"Hahaha you’re not far off. It’s not really on Dwight or Ben tbh, they’re just both a bad fit for each other. Dwight still has a place getting spot minutes, but he fouls at an absurd rate, and isn’t being productive in any other real way besides pretty solid rim protection. Ben’s numbers have been great with Embiid (as they always have tbh) but they just drop off a cliff with Dwight.  Big needs for me are an additional playmaker (George Hill, Satoransky, Patty Mills, Lowry on the high end) and a stretch big (Bjelica, Tucker, Muscala, Saric on the high end). I think both those needs are pretty easily addressed, and they’d make a massive difference."
He needs to come to SA when Patty Mills hangs it up.
"Before everyone gives Curry all the credit the 2012-2014 Spurs hit these shots too. Danny Green, Patty Mills, and Manu would take and hit these shots and they went to two finals and won one doing it."
Patty Mills died?
Sometimes I can't help but confuse Trent for Patty Mills
"ah, I see how they didn't include Patty in the top five section. clearly they just rightly assumed Sir Patrick Mills is just going to win then."
"&gt;Growing up the little Point Guard myself, I have a special place in my heart for the overlooked and underrated guys.  yet you didn't mention Patty Mills"
Trade him for Patty Mills. No one will notice
patty mills
If given a Patty Mills-esque role I don't see how he couldn't be a good piece on a contender.
He's also a pass-first player to the extreme.. earlier against the spurs they passed him the ball right under the basket with no one near him but patty mills and he didn't even look to put up the shot he just passed it back out to the perimeter
Don't forget Patty Mills and Danny Green.
Patty Mills?  Lmao
Also Andre Miller and Patty Mills.
"Notable players you forgot for the Spurs were Patty Mills, Andre Miller, and Kevin Martin."
"Notable players you forgot for the Suns were Leandro Barbosa, Stromile Swift, Matt Barnes, and Robin Lopez.  Notable players you forgot for the Spurs were Boris Diaw, Danny Green, and Patty Mills."
Mills is quietly having his best year as a pro this season at age 32. Good on ya Patty!
"Man, Can Jokic even block? A 6.0 Patty Mills laid it up over him easily."
"He’s on the Spurs; Pop traditionally has rookies on a shorter leash, and they’re stacked at G/F with Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, Demar, Keldon Johnson, Patty Mills, and Rudy Gay. He’s averaging 17 minutes a game, which isn’t terrible, but it’s the least of any lottery player besides Okongwu, Toppin, Jalen Smith, Kira Lewis, and Nesmith. Those guys suffer the same problem as Vassell- being stuck in the rotation due to roster depth- but I also think they’re significantly worse than Vassell."
"For a second I thought to myself, when did Patty Mills start playing for Toronto? Then realized that's Gary Trent Jr. lol"
Dunno why I thought he was Patty Mills...
I thought Patty Mills joined Raptors?
Patty Mills
"Lol k dude. All I’m saying is that volume and efficiency both matter. Not sure why you’re being so stubborn and acting like that’s such a crazy thing to say. Patty Mills, De’Anthony Melton, Kenrich Williams, and Norman Powell all have a higher PPP than Steph, Harden and Dame. I highly doubt you’d consider any of these guys better isolation scorers than the players we’re discussing. Not even you believe that."
He'll always be Australian Patty Mills in my heart.
"It might be what gets them there, but it isn’t what keeps them there.   Dion Waiters is a better player than Danny Green or Patty Mills, but he will never last longer. Guys who understand and excel in their roles will always have a longer career than a third wheel who thinks he’s first."
“Patty Mills”   **shudders**
Vucevic and Patty Mills are on the Mt Rushmore of Nets killers
"It's an interesting matchup because the Spurs play a lot of pick and roll with the ball handler attacking the paint and the Pacers have awesome rim protection with Turner. On the other hand, the Spurs have in Poeltl and Keldon 2 guys that will feats on boards against a poor defensive rebounding team, which Indiana is. Indeed, San Antonio rebounded 37.7% of their own misses so that was a dominating feature of the game and in a game with a more 'Spurs'-y turnovers rate that could have sealed the deal.  Indiana made every single corner 3 and boy, you could feel it.  Keldon Johnson was terrific in everything that's considered ""dirty work"". He's got great positioning for offensive boards, he's constantly slapping at airborne balls and and he dives at any loose ball he gets his eyes on.  Not looking to diminish the hot start but I thought LeVert was terrible in the clutch of regulation. Not just the 2 turnovers (including an unforced double-dribble) and the forced bad shot attempts but the clock management: The team is up 5 with a little over 3 minutes and he's the one man against a set Spurs defense. Instead of waiting for his teammates he barges in full force, early in the shot clock, towards the paint and it ends up in a jump ball where possession turns for the Spurs (who would get a 3 afterwards).  TJ McConnell is the man. I have been in love with his game all season and I have been flirting with him as a top 5 6MOTY candidate. He absolutely earned that +21 today. Then again, the other side in this game has Patty Mills, who might just be on the most impactful backup guards in the league.  I have been a big Murray fan since the beginning but I don't think I can handle many more of these ""let's run a play for a Murray midranges early in the shot clock"", even if he makes them at a solid rate."
i dont knoe. manu patty mills vs the heat vs also worth mentioning
"&gt;I actually looked at PGs per/year salaries and at $12m/yr he would be in the range of Clarkson, Pat Bev, Patty Mills, Cory Joseph, Marcus Smart, Dinwiddie, and Exum. I would see him settling in this range well. Smart/Clarkson would probably be the only guys I would take over him in this range, all things considered.  Just posted, but peep this list to see where you think he would slide in [https://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts/point-guard/](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts/point-guard/)"
"Oh I think his value to the team is immense, but the Mavs would be stupid not to listen to offers it they can get a legit two-way starter out of him.  Just looking at him as an asset, he is already 24. Will be 25 at the start of the season. His game isn't reliant on athleticism, so I could see his game maturing well into his 30s. You have to also take into account the Carlisle bump that a guard takes in his system- whether you believe it or not, it has proven to be true 80% of the time.  I actually looked at PGs per/year salaries and at $12m/yr he would be in the range of Clarkson, Pat Bev, Patty Mills, Cory Joseph, Marcus Smart, Dinwiddie, and Exum. I would see him settling in this range well. Smart/Clarkson would probably be the only guys I would take over him in this range, all things considered."
All I know about Gary Trent Jr is that I can’t tell the difference at a glance between him and Patty Mills.
Exactly. Remember that Patty Mills turnover against OKC early this season.
"Idk why you are getting downvoted but this was absolutely true for our matchups vs the Spurs. Started playing zone defense and suddenly our biggest fear was Patty Mills. When the b2b ended I told my friends (Spurs fans) that Pop needs to get LMA away from the young core asap but it's not like I thought he was retirement ready, it's just that the fit was shit"
Does no one consider Patty Mills anymore?
The disrespect to Patty Mills
Patty Mills is a guy who I follow more for what he does off court than what he does on. Not saying he aint great but a lot of people can learn a thing or two from Patty on how he interacts with his community. I love Patty and Im grateful of his leadership in our country.
"All those threads with ""not talking enough about"" are crap, well, all but this one.  I agree, he plays a really nice rookie season and is barely mentioned anywhere outside of Memphis. If everything goes normally, he'll have a 10+ years NBA career.  Reminds me a lot of Patty Mills, but he is taller and that obviously means, that he can reach a higher ceiling :D"
Yes the 2 best defenders in the league are...patty mills and Rudy gay
Patty Mills clearly the 2nd best defensive player in the game
"The thing that Spurs fans need to recognize (along with the org) is that you don't do anything meaningful with role players. You need a lead dog. DeRozan will be 32 at the start of next season...he ain't it. We can't build around a declining player who isn't even a surefire allstar.   So then what? Jakob Poeltl is a one-way five who will be 26 at the start of next sesason. He is who he is.   Patty Mills will be 33 at the start of next season, and is honestly a 3rd/4th guard. He's also not under contract.  DeJounte, while a nice player, is a 1-guard who can't shoot. You're not winning a playoff series if he's the engine of your offense.   Derrick White can't stay healthy and will be 27 at the start of next year. He is who he is, and that's not a lead dog.   So now we're talking ourselves into Devin Vassell and his 5.3 PPG, or Lonnie Walker (one of the worst players in the NBA according to the advanced analytics), or Luka Samanic who has been pretty bad for two years now, or Keldon Johnson, who...maybe? He can't really defend or shoot, though.  I like plenty of those guys, but they're a supporting cast."
"Don't I know it, man.   I have been a huge advocate for getting whatever we could for DeMar DeRozan and Rudy Gay and Patty Mills (and even, before the extension, Derrick White if it was enough value) and hitting the reset button.  This team stinks, none of the young guys have the ceiling to actually be *the guy* and we're either going to overpay aging players this summer to keep them around, or we're going to lose them for nothing because we wanted to go 37-35.  All because our coach is 72 years old and doesn't feel like resetting the roster."
Patty Mills will always be the GOAT towel waver
"&gt;Yes, all the spurs stars have been homegrown, like Lamarcus Ald... wait... Oh, he wasn't homegrown. But hey, he was after their last championship.   He also came long after they established themselves as a dynasty. And as far as I’m concerned, when a team reaches dynasty status, they kind of become a big market because they have a ton of fans and guys want to play there. The spurs didn’t reinvent themselves when they signed LA.    &gt;But surely no guys on the 2014 spurs were not homegrown. Like Patty Mills! And Boris Diaw... wait... both of those guys weren't homegrown, and...gasp!... both were signed in SA via the buyout market.  True, but it also has to do with being a contender, as I said earlier. Diaw’s agent specifically said he wanted to play for a contender. It’s harder for small market teams to get themselves into that position when free agency, and even sometimes the draft (cough cough *steve francis*) is so biased towards destination cities. Not to mention, Patty Mills was literally playing in China before they signed him, it’s not like he forced his way out of the blazers organization but they wanted to keep him.   &gt;That article shows all the buyout signings for 2008 to 2017. Surprise! Most are small market teams. Also, want to know who signed a crap load of those guys in the 2008-2012 period? That's right -- the small market Celtics!  Every buyout signing isn’t the Drummond one though, plenty of those are no name guys or extremely washed up veterans. Also, I personally wouldn’t consider the Celtics a small market. Boston is a smaller and cold city, yes, but they have a huge fan base and a storied history, not to mention being a top team at that point.   &gt;BTW, the Lakers definitely did not make boneheaded move after boneheaded move. Shows you just think like a biased boston fan.  Whatever dude I’m not having another argument lmao"
"Thats a good question.  Biggest one i can remember is pj brown to  the Celtics in 08, he was super clutch in game 7 of the ecf and hit some big shots that were crucial in them advancing. And he played really good d against pau  Other than that I remember the spurs got boris diaw and patty mills, but I dunno if that was during their finals against miami. And maybe birdman with miami?  But the list is super small. But I think Drummond is an exception"
Not the same year but Boris Diaw and Patty Mills for the Spurs They re-signed and became part of the 2014 team
"It wasn't just Duncan, he always had a strong supporting cast backing him up. Against the Heatles, he had Ginobli, Parker, Kawhi,, Danny Green, Patty Mills and Boris Diaw. In his earlier runs he had David Robinson backing him up."
"Once on the main website, the main headline of the day was patty mills drops 9 points off the bench."
"Just did a little research and it seems based on productivity, 2012 had a pretty strong market. Derek Fisher went to OKC and helped bring them to the finals, and Boris Diaw and Patty Mills were scooped up by the Spurs and became important parts to their future championship team. Based off household names alone though, I agree that this years field was packed and probably the best ever."
"Commentators routinely say g'day mate or mention shrimp when patty mills scores.   Of course he wouldn't say that if KD scored, why would he? I'm not finding your point here."
Hard to beat a team with Patty Mills and Aron Baynes
Spurs commentator does this whenever Patty Mills hits a three and i think Spurs fans like it lol
A very good and convincing Patty Mills impersonator
PATTY MILLS
"He was at best the 3rd best defender on his own team and got to benefit from Draymond and iguodala doing the heavy lifting with help defense rotations etc the stuff that’s more important while he just got to focus on his man. And he didn’t even have to guard anybody in round 2 or the WCF, guys like Patty Mills and Rodney hood a true gauntlet  The “but his defense was good” when it’s a guard is basically just holding guys to role player expectations"
"Canada for sure, but Australia has had quite a few players come and go in the league.  Luc Longley on the MJ Bulls  Bogut Simmons  Patty Mills Joe Ingles Matthew Dellavadova Thon Maker  Aron Baynes  Shane Heal and Andrew Gaze are some Aussie basketball legends that managed to make it to the NBA in in the 90’s  Matisse Thybulle is American but I believe he is gunna play for Australia in the Olympics which is great cause he’s my favourite player."
"I don't know why, but the NBA Second Spectrum has a different defensive rating formula/ranking. Among players with 25+ mpg, this is how the ranking looks like:  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Season=2020-21  1. Patty Mills 2. Mike Conley 3. LeBron James 4. Kyle Kuzma 5. Rudy Gobert"
Patty Mills
"&gt; He fits on teams with dominant ball handlers   Offensively, no question. He's the best off ball player ever and is top tier with the ball in his hands as well. I guess my point was more, does it matter (and how much) that defensively he'd be a pretty tough fit next to an all time great but defensively challenged point guard like Nash or Lillard? Whereas somebody like Durant would be a pretty good fit next to those point guards, but could also fit next to a star who played his position like Kawhi or Dirk. Or looking at role players; could you play Steph next to a Patty Mills type?   Still, I'm mostly agree with you. I have Steph 4th or 5th all time (post 1980) behind MJ, LeBron and Hakeem, not that I put as much work into actually figuring it out as Taylor. I go back and forth between him and Shaq. I think they are kind of weirdly similar even though they're complete opposites on the court. Shaq has some versatility problems too, but like Steph he's completely game-breakingly dominant with the right pieces around him."
Patty Mills
Haha what? I actually used to like his podcast but he’s like the worst kind of guy who says something just to maybe get an article written about it. Like bro no one cares what you have to say we just wanna here basketball. Don’t give us some crazy hot take about how Patty mills is a top 5 point guard.
"Never forget when In Patty Mills rookie year he averaged 2.6 ppg in 3.8 mins, but per 36 had him at 25ppg"
Patty mills makes a lot of sense for the sixers imo.
Patty mills
"Patty Mills, Kanter, Ersan Illyasova"
How in the world is Patty Mills getting more 3PA than Trae
"&gt; Is Jokic in the lead at the 6th seed with his atrocious defensive play?   So you love these defensive stats when they favour Lebron but discount them for Jokic? DBPM, D-PIPM, D-RAPTOR. Basically any defensive advanced stat paints Jokic as a very clear positive defensive player. Yet you call him atrocious.  &gt; Embiid missing the better part of a month will likely end his bid in addition to his 7 missed games.   Probably, although I could see Philly falling off a bit while he is out and then surging when he comes back helping the narrative on his case.   &gt; The voters will have fatigue and not vote Giannis because of his post-season failures, and Milwaukee whom I believe won't get the first seed which would be his only shot.   Yeah I mean if the best argument against Giannis is ""he's already won it"" maybe we should look at his actual stats.  &gt; So LeBron, who has a great record without Anthony Davis, is ranked at the top of multiple defensive metrics, which Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are not, should be the in the lead yes?   IMO no, I'd probably have him second or third on my ballot right now (with the exclusion of Embiid).  &gt; Also, LeBron consistently posts some of the best on/off court stats in the league year in and year out.   Firstly, what does year in year out have to do with MVP? Its this years award. Secondly, I dont really love on/off anyway because it doesn't really quantify anything other than how bad your replacement(s) is/are, but regardless all these guys have amazing on/off numbers, they are MVP candidates. Embiid +17, Lebron +11, Giannis +11, Kawhi +14 even Jokic has a +6 despite an incredibly strong bench unit on his team etc."
"Is Jokic in the lead at the 6th seed with his atrocious defensive play?  Embiid missing the better part of a month will likely end his bid in addition to his 7 missed games.  Luka is the 8th seed.  Steph isn't even in the playoffs right now.  The voters will have fatigue and not vote Giannis because of his post-season failures, and Milwaukee whom I believe won't get the first seed which would be his only shot.  James Harden has his Houston mess which will turn off voters in addition to being apart of a superteam roster with 34 combined allstar appearances.  So LeBron, who has a great record without Anthony Davis, is ranked at the top of multiple defensive metrics, which Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are not, should be the in the lead yes? Poised to keep winning games without Anthony Davis for another 3 weeks.   Also, LeBron consistently posts some of the best on/off court stats in the league year in and year out.   How do you *not* make the case LeBron is the favorite and in the lead right now?"
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
Patty Mills
Some of the more hardcore Australian basketball fans don't like Ben Simmons because he doesn't care about playing for the national team.  Patty Mills is considered the real leader of the national team.
Yes and Bryce Cotton is getting Australian citizenship so I think he can play. Not to mention FIBA Patty Mills who is basically Jesus
Tyus Jones and Tre Jones  Patty Mills and Garry Trent Jr.
"Gary Trent Jr. and Patty Mills, every goddamn time"
"Trade Steven Adams, NAW, Bledsoe and a pick for LMA and Patty Mills."
"DaRozan, LA, Patty Mills for Wiggins, Oubre, and Wiseman. Who says no?"
"DaRozan, LA, Patty Mills for Wiggins, Oubre, and Wiseman. Who says no?"
"I personally think Patty Mills did a great job on Luka, bothering him a lot, being a pest, avoiding screens, contesting his left on the stepback... The times he got beat or Luka tried to use his size on him, your guys played great team help defense on his drives, seriously, Luka was having a rough one tonight with Patty on him until the end."
Is any ref able to call a foul on Patty Mills?
"Idk man, if I’m the Spurs I’d look at Paul Reed and give up Patty Mills and a second for him."
"This is not exclusive to Luka, but something needs to be done about jumping into defenders for fouls, like Patty Mills has zero hope of guarding on this play.  If he stays to close getting over the screen, 3pt foul, if he waits and stays parallel to him Luka is literally jumping sideways into him.  This whole situation was bailed out by a good charge."
"I laughed way harder at that than I should have. Also loving that Patty Mills flair, I'm still sad he left Portland and that happened a decade ago"
I always forget why playing the Spurs stresses me out so much till Patty Mills subs in
Give me Maxey and bad contract for Patty Mills and LMA. It’s cool
"Patty Mills, a terrible defender, is 6th on that list lol"
"So, does that mean Patty Mills goes off every last 2 minutes.  I can dig that."
"It doesn't make sense on paper for the spurs at all. We already have Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Patty Mills, and DeMar DeRozan running the offense."
"Terrence Ross, patty mills, joe ingles"
"We're shopping our vets who're on expiring deals like Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Demar Derozan, Lamarcus Aldridge and potentially Trey Lyles as well.  I'm not expecting any of them to be getting traded, but those guys are on the table.   Spurs on in the middle of a rebuild, so makes sense to shop our vets. Patty and Demar have been excellent for us, so doubt Spurs will move them unless some irresistible offer comes along. Rudy and Trey Lyles are pretty useful pieces for teams looking to bolster their wing depth. Lamarcus is washed atm, so doubt we'll move him."
"Aldridge is the obvious answer, but besides that Dejounte I guess. Maybe Patty Mills."
Patty Mills might finally win an individual award
And then kawhi took a shit on your organization. Now you have no future! Atleast we bottomed out and will have nice picks. You get to be in a play in and will draft patty mills for the next decade
"The ""gidday mate"" when Patty Mills drains a three is soo cringe for me as a kiwi living in Aus"
James Harden - Back  Landry Shamet - Slump busted  Nicolas Claxton - Fucking beast  Patty Mills - Nets Killer  Our Defensive Rebounding - Trash  Our Defense Against 3rd Stringers - Still Trash  Game Over - W!!!!!
???  I have no idea what you're looking at. Dozier is 37th and Patty Mills is 171st
"Any of them bro, chuck Patty Mills in the NBL again and he'll basically be Bryce Cotton (3x league MVP undersized SG like Clippers Lou Will on steroids for those wondering) but better."
"On the benches are Kyle Anderson, Enes Kanter, Seth Curry, Derrick Favors, Patty Mills, and Nerlens Noel."
"Shame Patty Mills fell out of contention around midway through the season, he had a great start."
Patty Mills shooting like it's December first
Patty Mills doing his fellow Aussies a favour here.
Will Barton hates Golden State   Patty Mills too
Why are you doubting Rudy gay and Patty mills
Best case: Cj for Tobias harris.  Roco+ DJJ + Pick for Harrison barnes.  Sign a back up guard like Patty Mills.  Sign a back up big like Nerlens Noel.  Resign Powell and Melo.  Our lineup would look like this:  PG: dame/Mills  SG:Norm/Ant  SF: Barnes/Nas  PF:Harris/Melo  C: Nurkic/Noel/Collins
Wasn't Patty Mills a track star before he played ball?
You misspelled Patty Mills.
"Patty Mills is our most beloved remaining player, and he is an all around great dude.  But there had been some internal fan hate directed at him because he signed what would now not be considered an out of the ordinary contract a few years back.  Also a lot of people thought Aldridge was over the hill.  I love both of them though."
"His contract is 3 years $40 million. Players who make around that: taurean prince, patty mills, Cody zeller, Davis Bertans, Rudy gay, justice Winslow, dion waiters. Kuzma has been big for us all year if you watch the games. And what are you on about we kept him over lonzo? There was no way we kept lonzo or BI in that deal."
What's that you say? 35 minutes for Rudy Gay and Patty Mills?
wasn’t that Patty Mills?
Patty Mills lmao
When they tried to jinx patty mills on the FT line - holy shit. The hijinks those two get into. The Czar isn't as fun cause he doesn't understand half the things Brian says
You aren’t the only one.  Fuck patty mills  Fuck Jeff green  Fuck Terrence Ross  Fuck PJ Washington   And a lot of others.
"Hey guys, is Patty Mills a HOF player??"
"It’s mainly positional conflicts. We have like 6 guards and we’re probably going to bring Patty Mills back, so it just wouldn’t work positionally."
Patty Mills v Joe Ingles  Winner is Australian of the Year
I made multiple yrs of fake trades for the Sixers to get Patty Mills to fill that Seth Curry type role smh
"To have had Rudy, Demar, Lemarcus, and Patty Mills on one roster is wild. It’s like the all underrated team"
Rudy Gay and Patty Mills actively throwing for the spurs lately.
Patty Melt Mills
Patty f-in mills
Patty Mills is such a better play-in headliner than Eric Bledsoe.
Patty Mills aka Mr. 55
"This season, eight Australian-born players have played an NBA game.  - Ben Simmons  - Patty Mills  - Will Magnay  - Kyrie Irving  - Joe Ingles  - Josh Green  - Dante Exum  - Matthew Dellavedova  Irving does not represent Australia internationally, whereas Aron Baynes (born in New Zealand) and Matisse Thybulle (born in the US) do.  Ryan Broekhoff, Jonah Bolden, Mitch Creek and Isaac Humphries are all playing overseas but have spent time on NBA rosters in recent seasons. Josh Giddey is also a projected first round pick in this coming draft. I’m not sure where the number four comes from?"
Joe Ingles? LaMelo Ball? Patty Mills? Stephen Jackson?  Honestly this take is so incredibly weak.
No you can't  You'll get one Patty Mills and give him all our love
"You can get 'em battling, you can get 'em rattling, you can get 'em going up three. You can get 'em late, you can get 'em for a mate, you can get 'em playing DC.  A hard fought win needs a big cold free, and the best cold frees are Mills. Patty Mills."
Patty Mills standing there wide open the entire time lol
"Patty Mills was wide open bro. This man has some terrible vision down the stretch, he'll make clutch buckets but misses so many easier options."
Splash bandicoot is a way better patty mills nickname   Also Keldon “Big Body” Johnson is at least a fan favorite
"I just took another look at that draft and damn was it stacked.  Only a couple of misses in the top 20, and some good players all the way down to Patty Mills at 55.  Pretty good draft class."
ahh a patty mills special
Upgrade the bench big time. The leads are blown because the bench is like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound.   If these guys don’t get picked up by their current teams  Javale McGee  Daniel Theis  TJ McConnell  Josh Richardson   Patty mills
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are a couple of them:  Kawhi Leonard: [https://basketballbeacon.com/kawhi-leonard-player-profile/](https://basketballbeacon.com/kawhi-leonard-player-profile/)  Patty Mills: [https://basketballbeacon.com/patty-mills-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/patty-mills-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks!"
Patty Mills is the greatest 3 point shooter in Spurs history
"Seems pretty silly all around. On the play before, Sampson was a bit aggressive under the basket with Patty. Mills was definitely angling toward Sampson on the ensuing possession. I wouldn't say Mills did nothing but Sampson def overreacted. The context matters. Still, I think this was all well handled by the officials on the court. Should have ended there."
Do players ever appeal these fines? Do they ever get the union involved to help with the appeals? What was Patty Mills guilty of? And I guess Rudy Gay was supposed to let his teammate get beat up?
What did Mills do? WTF!!! I still have no idea why JaKarr was so pissed. He was the one that initially gave the cheap shot shove on the play before... not Patty. And I'm not sure Patty was even trying to retaliate on the next play... navigated through a screen at normal speed.
Patty Mills gets hit by a headbutt  NBA: Well you see Patty that headbutt you took wasn't the NBA product we like to deliver *sooooo* here's your fine.
The disrespect to Patty Mills.
My son about 5 years ago got his first autograph ever from Patty Mills and to this day he's still his favorite player.
"Damn, I still love Patty Mills."
"&gt;""and patty mills did not take a step back""  Fuckin rite m8"
Patty Mills is like the most nicest guy in the NBA. Seriously how the hell could you be angry at him? I just can't see him talking shit to him... he just probably was having a bad night and took it out on him.
"More than that, since he is indigenous he’s been dealing with shit-talking and I would assume altercations all his life  https://theundefeated.com/features/patty-mills-black-australian-spurs-guard-experienced-racism-long-before-a-fan-taunted-him/amp/"
Patty Mills committed the crime of ... *looks at notes*  Sort of running into him while he set a screen
Is it just me or did that push look way too hard to not even budge Patty Mills
"Really looks like pretty standard basketball, what was big dude so upset about? Shout out Patty Mills, dude was not fazed lmao."
Ruddy Gay and Patty Mills in a buddy cop movie would be fun.
Can’t believe I saw someone try to square up Patty Mills and fail lol.
Patty Mills of all people
Imagine starting a fight down 14 with......Patty Mills?
imagine not liking patty mills...  what kind of goof do you have to be?
Spurs? Patty Mills is from Australia. Ingles and Simmons are on some of the best teams. But the Jazz are probably not going to make it to the Finals for a while and Ingles is pretty entertaining. Simmons supposedly almost chose Aussie Football for his sport.
"I mean Udonis Haslem tho  Beal and Dame were both drafted by the wizards and blazers around the same time that Patty Mills signed with the Spurs I think, and of course Lowry was traded to the raptors that same year."
i love patty mills on and off the court.   but my boy keldon f*cking johnson has stolen my heart this year...
Patty Mills. Only member of the 2014 team left
"There were also a number of solid players they could have chosen over Hasheem. Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, Patty Mills, Brandon Jennings, and Patrick Beverley to name a few. Hell, even Ricky Rubio would have been a better pick."
pshh spurs elite defenders like patty mills derozan and gay finna gonna lock him up/s   dont think the /s is needed but peeps be soft ya know
"Depends on what you consider guys like Danny Green, Bellinelli or Patty Mills for example, we didn't draft Any of them"
"My favorite basketball book ever is Eleven Rings by Phil Jackson. In that book, he describes what he believes is the key ingredient of the mysterious alchemy behind winning, successful teams or what he calls 'the pursuit of the impossible. He says it comes down to - 'a great love for one another'.   “The ring. That was the motto. It’s not just the band of gold. It’s the circle that’s made a bond between all these players. A great love for one another.”  I think about this wisdom all the time in my role as a leader. When I see these kinds of moments between players - I feel like Im watching a team that's about to do great things. I remember seeing a lot of these moments last year with the Lakers. As a Spurs fan, it was all those Patty Mills coffee club posts on IG, the silly frog posing shit Manu used to do. I'd like to think we're seeing a glimpse of what the Celts can do come playoff time."
"Come on bro. Pop is great but Spurs had a ton of talent and basketball IQ players. Duncan, Parker, Manu, Kawhi. Even the secondary players were great with Dias, Danny Green, LMA, Patty Mills, etc. Absolutely loaded with All Stars and former All Stars. 2016 team had so many All Stars/All NBA Players: Kawhi, Duncan, Manu, Parker, LMA. Many of those turnovers happened because OKC had horrible spacing. So anytime Russ/KD drove to the rim there was 3 defenders waiting in the paint. Teams could also overplay passing lanes because guys like Perkins and Roberson won’t hurt you if are out of position."
"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."
Ah yes DPOY candidates Patty Mills and Shake Milton
"I remember some Wolves fan was really pissed off that Spurs fans wanted to retire Patty Mills’ jersey because he was just a role player, don’t know why people get so worked up about this stuff."
"I think it was the 2010-2011 season for 2k that I really liked. They had Patty Mills, Gerald Wallace, Nic Batum, Rudy Fernandez, Andre Miller with the trio."
The 8 extra inches of grit and determination he has on Patty Mills really paid off.
I remember when Patty Mills was problem.
I always root for the Australian team for Patty Mills lmao
"I mean it's too early to write off anyone after 1 season. Wiseman could have really used the G-League, but due to the pandemic that development was slowed. Maybe he'll pan out, maybe he won't. Ayton definitely has taken a little bit of time but starting to show things, finally. Trae Young as well this post season also doing a lot of work.   Tyreke Evans was the 2009-2010 MVP. Not saying it's the same scenario with Ball, but just to show it's not always an indication that team ran away with the best player (or that there were other issues). Blake, Harden, Rubio, DeMar, Curry, Jrue, Jordan Hill, Pat Bev, Danny Green, Patty Mills, Brand Jennings all came out of this draft too."
"As an Aussie/Melbourne based basketball player it's actually much worse when you consider Ben's journey  He is the son of David Simmons an American import who played in the Australian NBL basketball league   He played with Andrew Gaze, generally considered the best Aussie basketball icon historically.  He was basically Aussie Larry Bird, tall white unathletic white guy who could shoot the lights out and had an amazing career including in NBA and Olympics   Ben is from that world and had the best coaching, mentoring and access to the elite Australian basketball schools.  The fact that he can't shoot at all really is confusing as Melbourne hoops does fundamentals right as we don't generally have the same level of atheltiscm as the states.  Consider Bogut, Patty Mills and Jingles are all from this hoops world, I understand his high b-ball iq is a result of this origin  but the fact he can't and won't shoot makes no sense and its getting worse"
"Kahwi was CLEARLY held back behind the big 3, you don't go from balling out against the #1 team &amp; player in the NBA, an elite defensive team btw, to role player in the reg season, doesn't work like that.    Kawhi was put on a leash behind subpar players, Tony Parker used to freeze Kawhi out of the offense &amp; dudes like Danny Green &amp; Patty Mills used to get more shots than Kawhi because of Pops system."
"Stephen Jackson, Phoenix Suns version of Baynes, Patty Mills, Danny Green, Splitter and Diaw on the bench is a nice bench too."
"Hey now, the Spurs got LmA and Patty Mills from Portland, fair is fair."
Then what happened at FIBA a few years ago? Stars vs Role players?  The team you sent won’t be too different if this comment section is to be believed.  You also have not seen Olympic Patty Mills.
"sorry, should've put an asterisk on 'universally liked'  list of people who dislike Patty Mills:  JaKarr Sampson"
Patty Mills
"To piggyback off this, Australia (if all their players show) has a really solid rotation. Ben Simmons, Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Matisse Thybulle, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Baynes, and Dante Exum is a solid group of NBA players. They also have other notables like Mitch Creek, Ryan Broekhoff, Thon Maker."
"USA had all NBA players at the world cup and didn't look that crash hot. With the differences in FIBA and NBA rules, being an NBA player no longer automatically makes you a good contender in world cup and Olympics. Look at Giannis, he was MVP but struggled to average 10 points at the world cup, and Greece had some solid players around him.  Additionally some players that are just alright in the NBA are absolute studs in FIBA, see Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio."
Patty Mills
"there are players way less mobile than harden with worse shooting, worse court vision and worse handles that still are valuable in the league. take mike conley for example. the only thing he is better at than a way less athletic harden is perimeter defense. and he ist an important piece for a contender. or kyle lowry. or patty mills. or maybe even chris paul.   if giannis loses most of his athleticism he is definetly worse than blake griffin currently. worse shooting, worse handles, worse playmaking"
"Campazzo is Dellavadova, JJ Barea and Patty Mills in one"
"I'd still take Australia over them.   Ben Simmons with 3 40% 3 point shooters in Patty Mills, Joe Ingles and Ryan Broekhoff and a big that can hit an open shot in Baynes/Maker/Landale is a great starting 5. Not star-studded, but as a team they fit together so well.   Then they can bring Matisse Thybulle, Exum, Delly, Josh Green, Giddey off the bench.   They're just a smart, well balanced team, there's no teething problems with trying to fit high usage players together, they just have a bunch of solid role players that can defend, shoot and facilitate at a high level."
"Shoulder injuries are a different category for NBA players vs. knee injuries. Kobe had rotator cuff surgery in 2015 and came back fine. Patty Mills, Cody Zeller, and Tyler Johnson have all had shoulder surgeries.   If you were a pitcher, a torn labrum might be a potential career ended. But it doesn’t seem to be the case in basketball."
"Dw, Patty Mills and Jingles got you."
Gotta love 2k. I have had multiple matches of getting killed by Patty Mills. Going off for 40+ points per match up

"I mean i think Pop did an amazing job with this years Spurs. The top 5 minutes played on the Spurs were Dejounte Murray, Derozan, Keldon Johnson, Poetl, and Patty Mills.   They still got the 10th seed and for the better part of the season were in the 8th seed ahead of GS until Covid hit them and they lost Derrick White for the season after he only played 30ish games.   1) DJM - elite defensive player with no consistent outside shot  2) Derozan - sucks on defense, has no outside shot   3) Keldon Johnson - effecxtively a rookie with no outside shot   4) Poetl - good on defense, no offensive game outside of rolling to the baskett   5) Mills - career 6th man   He still took this team to a record better than the Pelicans with BI/Zion, Kings with Fox, Hield, Barnes, Haliburton, and was close to the Warriors who had an MVP candidate, Celtics who had Jaylen/Jayson, etc."
"The only things they can do is try to get something for Harrell and Kuzma in a trade and use their MLE. They're over the cap just with the guys they have under contract. If they are trying to sign a PG the best they can do is probably Cam Payne, Reggie Jackson, or Patty Mills. Their best bet is to salary dump Kuzma, but the problem is that they don't really have any picks to trade and Kuzma's value is so low now. Run it back with a new point guard is the best they can do unless they unload Kuzma somehow."
Patty mills had sone good years as hype man with his towel
Brunson reminds me of a young patty mills
"TJ McConnell, Patty Mills, Derrick Jones Jr., Alec Burks, Facundo Campazzo"
"Dillon Brooks, Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Javale Magee  I omitted former Sixers because there’s a few, but dammit I’m still gonna say TJ McConnell"
"Dinwiddie, Patty Mills, Clarkson, Bledsoe - and some of these guys can occasionally start of course at SG - just like Schröder, I’d say that’s pretty much exactly his tier anyway so he at least should get paid like the rest of these guys unless everyone wants to stay blinded by recency bias"
"&gt; Patty Mills - Popovich  This is such an interesting one too.  As an Aussie fan, I can't think of a coach who suits Patty more on a personal level but I'm not sure about their fit on a basketball level.   Patty is always huge for the Australian team because we let him hero-ball and he's one of those guys who gets better in a bigger role.   He's always felt limited by Spurs-ball. He's a firecracker and they're a slow-burning team."
I didn’t realize stotts had been the coach that long. Also could have sworn that patty mills played on another team at some point in his career but I was wrong. Crazy how long that guy has been in the league
Patty Mills - Popovich  Steph and Draymond - Kerr  Haslem - Spoelstra
"Devonte' Graham, TJ McConnell, Patty Mills, to name a few."
Is it just me or is Patty Mills a top 16 all time player
No that’s disrespectful to kenny. Patty mills has never averaged more than 11 points. He’s more like mike Conley
Yeah he was like a Patty Mills.
"They were going to run him into the ground with the team they gave him, everybody was loading up with superstars like KD, PG, Lebron etc. The Spurs Pau Gasol and Patty Mills lol."
"nah it's as much about porzingis, he's been horrible contesting 3s all year and now they're now starting 5 40% shooters, and on the other end it baits him into punishing mismatches which he's also been awful at getting clamped by patty mills  this lineup should have seen at least 25 minutes in g1 instead of 5  i know carlisle been expecting it though"
"I swear a random rotational guard off the bench always goes crazy in the playoffs every year lol. Off the top of my head of the games I watched I saw Nate Rob, Aaron brooks, Beno Udrih, Goran dragic, Reggie Jackson, and patty mills win a game for there teams in a series."
&gt; The real crucial match up of this series: Patty Mills v. Kent Bazemore  YOU LIED TO ME
Now imagine a backcourt w him AND Brynn Forbes AND Patty Mills... we had zero defense in 2019 lmao
Can't forget the goat Patty Mills.   Although it's a shame we're missing out on a full reunion. If it weren't for covid we'd have Bogut (now retired) and a younger/healthier Baynes.
I love Patty Mills.
"Not really, he was pretty good for us against Denver, we even called game 7 the Bryn Forbes game. It’s just him and Demar couldn’t coexist in the starting lineup defensively. And off the bench him and Patty Mills were a disaster defensively. He’s playing with Giannis so obviously he’d look better than playing with us."
"Honestly - not even upset. When you get obliterated that hard it hurts *way* less than a close loss. This reminded me so much of the 2014 Finals vs the Spurs. An AMAZING start to the series (first 2 games then, Game #1 of this series) and then the team wanting revenge clapped the shit outta us shooting what feels like 70% from 3-point range. Bryn Forbes Spurs energy also added to that effect lmao, some Patty Mills/Danny Green/Boris Diaw bullshit.    We're gonna get clowned for being considered bubble frauds. That's fine. I wouldn't trade that improbable run for anything('cept for a title lol) - plus I think it's looking more realistic that all 4 conference finalists get eliminated in the 1st Round this year. There's a bit of Heat soul-searching that'll need to be done if we get swept tho(I don't expect us to, I expect us to respond in Game #3) but if we don't - it's gonna be a long offseason, 'specially cuz the only rotation guys under contract are Bam/Jimmy/Herro."
Cant wait for patty mills 3fmvps.
"Mavs winning game 1 has already shown me the 20s will be a repeat of the 10s  Lakers already won last year, Mavs will now win, Jimmy will back to back, and then Patty Mills is somehow gonna turn the Spurs around for 2024"
It's like the Spurs video with Patty Mills and gang back in the day.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxw2FZBd7aY
Retiring Patty Mills number would be an absolutejoke
"Fr, I'd die for Patty Mills"
Don’t talk like that about Patty Mills
Patty Mills LOL
Spurs maybe  Parker  Manu  Tiago Splitter  Pau Gasol  boris diaw  patty mills  All are international players
1. Shane Battier 2. LeBron James 3. Ben Wallace 4. Dave DeBusschere 5. Bruce Bowen 6. Andrew Bogut 7. Metta Sandiford-Artest 8. Tim Duncan 9. Patty Mills 10. Gary Payton
Best player right now is DeMar DeRozan.  They also don't really have any great shooter.  Best is Patty Mills who's at 37.5% on 6 attempts.  Then theres Rudy Gay at 38% but on 4 attempts.  Pops is just working with what he has.
Dude trust me. I’m a heat fan and 2014 is still on my brain. If pop had the shooters he’d definitely have no problem shooting more threes. The only three point shooter they really have at the moment is patty mills.
Patty Mills has enter the chat!!!!
"Spurs had TP Manu Danny Green Kawhi Marco belinelli patty mills and Cory Joseph, they were really deep. Tony Parker was absolutely an elite scorer, Manu was still explosive, Kawhi made big shots and Danny green couldn’t miss, pretty disrespectful statement to that team. Also imo jrue and Kris are capable of avg 25+ easily considering higher volume and mins in the playoffs."
Spurs are 99% sure retiring #8 for Patty Mills for the same reason the Heat are retiring #40
Patty Mills with +18 damn.
should've benched demar and played patty mills for the last 5
Someone told Patty Mills it was the NBA finals and he was playing the Heat again.
Patty Mills is a difference maker
Fucking Patty Mills.....
PATTY MILLS
Respect patty mills though for at least trying to shoot the 3s. Mid range ain’t working out for them at all
You did see that patty mills corner shot shortly after?
Hot take but I think the Spurs would be better with LeBron James and Steph Curry instead of Rudy Gay and Patty Mills.
remember when patty mills was good
Lack of spacing because they do not have a consistent three point shooter other than patty mills
Watching derozen and Rudy Gay jack up contested midrange shots is just brutal. I'd rather have patty mills shoot 25 shots
It feels like patty mills been in the league forever lmao
Ooh Patty Mills.
Patty Mills is clutch as fuck.
Patty Mills froM DEEP
Yall dont understand when i say spurs are winning this game? Patty mills drop &gt;5 3s
I had no idea Patty Mills was still playing
Eh it was just poor timing. Patty Mills and some other guys have had a bigger green light this year than before. The real issue is he can’t defend or really rebound for shit
"Man, how close would the Patty Mills be to his number getting retired by the Spurs?  Currently 10 years with the team and the 2014 championship. He's the last remaining player in the Spurs from the Tim/Manu/Tony era too."
"People really think smaller markets just love to give their best player to bigger markets lmao  “Still talented”, that’s what you’d say about Patty Mills. D Fox is a 23 year old all star level player"
"Lowest contested rebound percentage, minimum 50% of games played  Patty Mills (6.0%) Tyus Jones (7.3%) Isaiah Joe (9.1%) JJ Redick &amp; Trey Burke (9.4%) **Carmelo Anthony is at 27.8%**  Melo is the GOAT."
Looking like patty mills out there 😂
"I've always liked Pop for a lot of reasons, but the stories about how much interest he takes in his players' lives, family history, culture, etc. really put me over the top. Spurs have been a truly international and multicultural squad during his tenure and there are countless stories about him using going way above and beyond even with players who only ever came off the bench or never quite panned out in the NBA. I remember one example in particular where he illustrated a point about team strategy by highlighting an obscure element of history from the Torres Strait Islands because it was a significant holiday there that day and Patty Mills' family is from there. Totally unprompted."
Too late. We're Taking Ayton for Patty Mills and you can't stop us
It’s also not the only time he’s done it. Here he is doing it to patty mills  https://streamable.com/3e3qy
"If chris bosh was so elite and so mobile and such a transcended 5, why were the heat relying on Greg Oden and Birdman at center? Because bosh could only play it in stretches and even then he was nowhere close to Gobert. Watch chris bosh get shredded repeatedly by patty mills in 13 and 14, he was mobile for his time but doesn’t touch Gobert."
"Terrifying game. Never want to see Patty 'Steph Curry' Mills, Rudy 'Steph Curry' Gay or Dejounte 'Steph Curry' Murray again."
Does that make Patty Mills Captain Kangaroo?
It's Patty Mills.
It must be a Spurs thing  He and Patty Mills
Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio in FIBA are like a Steph and Klay backcourt
"Is Spain looking like real contenders this year? I mean, Gasol brothers are pretty much washed, i think Rubio is a decent player but i dont think he has the skillset to lead a team like Patty Mills because hes not really a scorer, and the rest of the team is missing some key pieces like Ibaka."
But Bald Patty Mills went off in Game 5 of the 2014 Finals to put away the Heat. I will always remember that hair (or lack of) forever.
People thought I was kidding about bald Patty Mills. I wasn't.
The bucks wish they had patty mills
"Spurs are most likely not retiring it. It really depends on if we ever know if Pop and Kawhi ended in good terms. Patty Mills is more likely to have his jersey retired than Kawhi if you asked fans, that's for sure."
"An average FIBA game has like 70+ FGA.  KD was taking 13, 13, 9 FGA in the 3 exhibition games.  That's not enough for someone, who is that good at shooting.  Like Patty Mills took 16, 21 FGA in his 2 games."
Not if patty mills has anything to say about it
"I’m not an Aussie, but I always root Australia for basketball. FIBA and Olympic ball is why Patty Mills is one of my favorite players. So glad they added Tisse this year  That said yeah Javale would be a great fit with the Aussie squad"
"And while you guys were contending, you handed out bloated contracts to guys like Patty Mills and Pau Gasol. In 2017-2018, the holy quadruplet of Pau Gasol, Patty Mills, Tony Parker, and Rudy Gay was taking over half of your salary cap."
"In fiba basketball, patty mills is all we need mate, your team this year is no where near what it was in prior Olympics. Little fiba experience and little chemistry. If you wanna talk about getting cocky you should talk to the dude who thinks the team of 6 is gonna beat a top scorer in the Olympics, one of the best defenders in the nba, an extremely deep bench, and play making and shooters out the wazooh. You guys put up a good fight with a full team, you wont win with 6."
PG: Dlo/Patty Mills/McLaughlin   SG: Ant/Bolmaro  SF: McDaniels/Okogie  PF: Simmons/vet backup maybe James Johnson   C: Kat/Naz Reid/Dieng
The thought of facing Patty Mills again has quite the affect
Patty Mills for PM. Already has the bloody initials
"2012-2014 Spurs deserve a shout. I think I read somewhere that one of those teams has one of the best net ratings ever, they won a championship, nearly won another, and lost to OKC I think in 2012 who were their kryptonite. Danny Green nearly won Finals MVP because of how great their team ball was and how well they were balanced. During the 13-14 regular season, Parker led the team in scoring with 16.7ppg, less than double the 8th leading scorer, Boris Diaw with 9.1ppg. Six players averaged double figures for points. Duncan, Parker, Ginobili, Parker, Green, and Leonard will all be remembered past their era, and Patty Mills and Marco Bellinelli will be remembered by Spurs fans."
Will upvote anything Patty Mills. Or patty melt.
"If some team with cap space is desperate to overpay for a point guard, do you really think Schroder will be the guy they target? I would think that Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, or even Kemba Walker would be better targets."
Patty Mills and Lillard will lead their to team to the finals or what ever is the finals in this alternate universe.
"That's true, but Schroder is also entering free agency as a point guard in a market which will be flooded with good available point guards. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills and even Kemba Walker (who could easily be had if a team has the cap space to absorb him). Are there really going to be teams out there lining up to throw tons of money at Dennis Schroder after the lackluster season he just had?  The flip side to you pointing out how guys like Deng and Mozgov got way overpaid is to look at guys like Jusuf Nurkic and how [he got way underpaid](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1015432798138662912?s=19) just because [he entered free agency at the wrong time.](http://es.pn/2ny4aRs) Schroder wants a ton of money but I have serious doubts that the market is going to be there for him."
"“What’s Patty Mills up to these days?” “Um, sir…”"
Maybe they can get Patty Mills.
He was letting Patty Mills blow by him when they lost to Australia
"Not OP, but I’d say the argument was that between Jordan and Pippen, you had offense covered and then some. Even on creaky knees, Harper was a defensive beast who initiated quite a bit of fast break opportunities (that Pippen or Jordan finished emphatically).  Plus…and this is a huge PLUS…they didn’t flail out their legs or flop around like dying salmon on the court.  Can we trade Harden, CP3 and all NBA refs for Patty Mills, a random Argentinian and all FIBA refs??"
"&gt; I'm saying he will provide space against specifically a full court defence. Which the Nigerian team were running during this game. This is because there is literally a full court of space between the defender and the rim that would allow Simmons to use his speed and handle to get to the rim.  because we all know Patty Mills is *super* slow  Also, Simmons getting to the rim doesn't help if the opposing team have literally one guy who's already gone back, because he's too chickenshit to dunk on anyone.  Ben Simmons's potential value to this team is ""benchwarmer""."
"I'm saying he will provide space against specifically a full court defence. Which the Nigerian team were running during this game. This is because there is literally a full court of space between the defender and the rim that would allow Simmons to use his speed and handle to get to the rim.  against a zone defence which is way more common in the NBA where players play closer to the rim and don't bother guarding him at the perimeter because he can't shoot that's when he becomes negative space, so what you say does have some merit to it.  I'm only saying that Simmons *could* be useful because he can cover our *potential* weakness to a full court defence due to our surplus of shooters and lack of ball handlers. I highlight the word ""potential"" in that statement because not even that is proven, someone else in the comments said Patty Mills would fill that role nicely and he sat out that game, and that is a perfectly valid and respectable opinion. This is entirely a discussion assessing Ben Simmons potential value to this specific team. I'm not saying he's flawless and we're hopeless without, I'm just analysing a specific situation he *could* be useful."
nba is a joke no wonder these guys are getting slapped by patty mills
"Still losing to boomers with out Patty Mills and Ingles, nah I'm just kidding Giannis would bully them."
"Yes, but if nobody offers him any kind of big contract then he isn't going to walk for less money elsewhere. He has to get at least one big offer to make his threat to walk credible, and he'll be competing with a bunch of other free agent point guards: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, etc. Kemba Walker could also easily be had with cap space if some team wanted to take him off OKC's hands. I think the odds of Schroder getting a big offer this summer are small."
"I think Schroder is really gonna get screwed this summer. He gambled on himself by refusing the Lakers extension offer, and he really played like shit afterwards. Now he's left hoping a big market exists for him this summer, but he's a point guard in a free agent market flooded with available point guards this summer: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (if a team with cap space wants to use it to absorb his deal). I really don't see any team making Schroder a big offer, which means he may need to just accept whatever he can get from the Lakers, which will almost surely be much less than the $84 million they offered him back in February."
I feel like Lonzo is a better version of Kcp in all honesty. It would make sense to run him at the 2 and get a bench PG like patty mills or someone.
Batum? Justice Winslow? Patty mills? McConnell?Neto? I’m just trying to name people they can afford.
"2008 Olympics, some notable names:  Spain: Pau, Marc, Rubio, Calderon, Rudy Fernandez, Juan Carlos Navarro  Argentina: Carlos Delfino, Manu, Andres Nocioni, Pablo Prigioni, Luis Scola  China: Yao, Yi Jianlian  Germany: Dirk  Australia: Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Andrew Bogut  ----------  I feel like the idea of these teams being better now is just something that people keep repeating to the point that they accept it as fact. I think Spain and Argentina from '08 easily beat all these teams.  The Redeem team had a legit hard-fought game against Spain in the Gold Medal match."
LeBron returning just to get torched by Patty Mills and Joe Ingles  You love to see it
Patty Mills really does not visibly age aside from his locs
Lebron and Kobe in the same team is surely a scary sight. Patty Mills in this match is crazy though his pass and decision making was a bit meh but his slashing is amazing.
Well you’re probably correct. I also think OP is wording it weirdly.  Patty Mills went past CP3 for the layup.  OR   Patty Mills passed by CP3 for the layup.
Patty mills grand children all playing together
Some of the highlights for fellow Patty fans  Mills:   2:38 goes full court passed CP3 for the lay up 2:50 again gets passed CP3 for a lay up 3:10 assist 7:51 steal off Howard and drives full court passed Derron Williams for lay up 15:15 Offensive rebound and basket off Ingles Miss 15:27 Draws offensive foul then gets bucket on Williams   Ingles:  13:58 Deep three
No exaggeration I want Patty Mills
He should’ve been doing trust falls into the waiting arms of Patty Mills &amp; Aron Baynes while Powderfinger gently played in the background
They should get Patty Mills I reckon.
"Patty Mills also lived in Canberra. We have some other notable athletes too, like Nick Kyrgios who still lives here"
"imo let the old vets walk except for rudy gay, yes the spurs should move on from patty mills as well even if he's a spurs legend. and don't trade either derrick white or dejounte murray nor any of the young guys unless they're getting a star in return."
"There have been a post game thread about the last game, and many NBA players are going to Tokyo, including all of team USA, Gobert, Luka, Evan Fournier, Patty Mills, and many more."
For real. Do you know how dam motivated a lot of other national teams are? They want to bring the gold home. Look at how Patty freaking Mills becomes when playing for Australia. That's the same thing for the other teams.
I guess it goes to show that time playing together helps a lot.  But still a team led by KD and Dame should not be losing to a team led by Patty Mills and Joe Ingles(I still love you Joe).
If this roster existed on an NBA team we could call them a super team and the title favorites.  Why would we not bash the title favorites for losing to a team of Patty Mills and Joe Ingles?
Dame can’t even help KD get a win over Patty Mills
&gt; talent is king   Patty mills and dellavadova beat Kevin Durant exactly one day ago
Imma include International Patty Mills
"Haslem, Steph, Patty Mills, and maybe Beal?"
Patty Mills isn't a lifer; he played for the Blazers
"I don't know if Zeller is necessarily the answer, but I also don't know why people would assume NBA All Stars would be necessary to compete internationally if bench players like Patty Mills, Gabe Vincent, and the skeleton of Luis Scola are smoking teams."
Nobody wanna hear that bs when you get outplayed by Matisse Thybulle and Patty Mills
Lol we should all freak out when goof balls try to put Patty Mills next to HOF players.
"def both. international is catching up, but like, with the exception of Luka who we haven't played yet, it's not like any of the teams we are playing are beating us with stars. Patty Mills and Ingles are lovely players, but man, even if the top 30 nba players opted out we should still be able to beat australia with our #31-45 best players.   it's really that our guys are unprepared for international rules, and we are still falling into the trap of (mostly) picking the best players in the nba without thinking about roster construction. like, obviously we have way too many ball dominant players"
"it shows a complete lack of understanding of international basketball and basketball in general when people make posts like this.   Just because somebody is a superstar in the NBA does not make them leaps and bounds better than another professional basketball player. There are a lot of factors that create superstars in the NBA, like the NBA rules, the way the games are refed, the teams featuring them and letting them control the offense, etc, etc.   &amp;#x200B;  Patty mills is an incredibly talented player and when hes featured with a team like australia where they have years and years of experience playing together (whereas the american team is often a random group of guys playing for the first time) he really shows out. We have like a decade+ of watching Patty Mills absolutely kill it in international competition at this point, so if you're surprised by this you are not paying attention at all."
"The gap shouldn’t be gone.   USA has multiple guys that are considered the best players in international competition.   Considering that the USA probably has 8 of the 10 best players in the entire tournament should show you that the USA is still very much an All-Star team for international competition.   Patty Mills likely doesn’t make team USA based on his talent, and he just was the best player in a game against team USA. The rest of the world got better at basketball, but no one has come close to catching up. This is USA just playing terribly, and likely shows that they need to start focusing more on roster constructions as opposed to just getting the best/most popular players."
"Team USA has fucking Kevin Durant and Dame Lillard and lost to Australia featuring Joe Ingles and Patty Mills  The talent differential has shrunk from where it was in 1992 but the rest of the world has not “caught up,” Team USA had no business losing these games (even though they’re going to be fine probably)"
Ingles and Patty Mills are bench players?
"Dellavedova, Ingles, Patty Mills. Name a more iconic big 3"
"Hmm if Patty Mills is playing way better while not coached by Pop and all of the US players are playing way worse than usual while coached by Pop, what conclusion should we draw"
"Pattys international stats are nice, 20ppg!  https://www.basketball-reference.com/international/players/patty-mills-1.html"
"you can make that argument at OP if you want, but that's totally different from being all ""how dare!!!! you compare patty mills to manu!!! 😱😡"" which was obviously not what he was doing at all."
"all these all-stars and all nba talent, and they can't beat Patty Mills smh"
"what does this have to do with knowing about patty mills?  like the other guy said, it's just reading comprehension to understand his meaning.  and he's played on the Australian national team, obviously.  (he was drafted #55 by the blazers and actually did play a little for them after a stint in the gleague, then there was some NBL and CBL stuff during the 2011 lockout before he wound up on the spurs, apparently.)"
"The big names just dealt with a short offseason, a compressed schedule and a postseason that felt like a demolition derby. USA is the most worn down team on the planet right now. Conversely, no one realized Popovich has been intentionally resting Patty Mills for years. The dingo has entered the nursery, and he hungers for glory."
"That's true, but in Thybulle's case he's joining a squad where guys know and play their roles perfectly. I think Thybulle knows he's there for his defense/cutting mainly, not to be their no.1 option like Patty Mills. For Team USA, in addition to the questionable roster construction, most of these guys are figuring how they can be beneficial to the team. All in all though loving that other teams are stepping up and making things a hell lot more competitive."
"he said it very clearly though?  he answered a question (why doesn't patty mills look like this in the nba) with ""(because) he plays for the spurs.  manu never averaged more than blahblahblah _for the same reason_.""  it's completely clear that he wasn't comparing patty mills' ability to manu's, just the extent that being on the spurs kind of nerfs both of their stats."
Patty Mills on the Australian Olympic team = GOAT
Lol cmon man. Patty Mills is alright but he’s not good compared to USA Olympics players or even nba starters.
It was a joke comment. Australia had a ridiculous history of amazing athletes across many sports . Patty Mills wouldn’t even be near the conversation about an Australian athletic Mt Rushmore
Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio are both prime Magic Johnson with Australia and Spain respectively lmao
Patty Mills is incredible in the green and gold
&gt; Patty Mills was cooking KD  He put that shrimp on the barbie alright.
Patty Mills doesn't seem to have a problem with that
"Patty Mills is absolutely one of Australia's best players.  Think of who isn't in the USA team.  LeBron, Curry, Chris Paul, Kawhi, AD , Harden, Mitchell, etc.  If KD isn't on this team, this is USA B Squad.  Tatum is really good though. But I don't think he makes USA A Squad."
"There’s no excuse to lose to Australia. To lose to some dude Patrick Mills, who goes by Patty Thrills for the San Antonio Spurs. Or Matthew Dellavedova. Or Joe…however the hell you pronounce his name. You give up 30 points on 3’s? Excuse me, you can do better than that."
FIBA Patty Mills hits different
"The biggest issue I’ve seen is they don’t give a damn on defense. Australia has talent and plays great team basketball but no fucking way should patty mills be killing you on cuts to the hoop. Dude shoots 2/3 of his shots from deep in the nba, no chance he should be getting easy looks inside. Part of that is not playing together like you said but some of that is effort and they’re lacking a lot of it right now."
FIBA Patty Mills is his final form
"""KD, lavine, beal, lillard, draymond and bunch of other all stars are underdogs against patty mills"" - r/nba"
"And? Patty Mills outplayed all of them, you don't think Luka can? And, Luka is definitely better than all of them easily except KD."
"Holy shit you met Patty Mills, Ben Simmons, AND Dante Exum?"
The sheer disrespect to an Olympic Patty Mills team smh
"If you have such a low opinion of Patty Mills based off a cursory scan of Basketball Reference - because I know you don’t follow the NBA at all - then I am not interested in anything else you have to say.  Mills has been one of the best backup PGs of the past decade, and can go and get a bucket against pretty much anyone including “starters”.   You cannot be serious man. Underrate other countries &amp; players at your own peril. But I’ve watched a lot of basketball, and back to back exhibition losses with the core Olympic squad is bad fucking news."
Lol yeah I would imagine a team led by Patty Mills would be in that territory.
Patty Mills scored 17 points in 18 minutes in Game 5 of the 2014 NBA Finals to eliminate the Heat.  just want to throw some light on that peformance because it never gets mentioned.
"If you think that patty mills looks good, wait til you see Olympic Franky Smokes in our first game against France"
Patty Mills playing for the national team actually turns him into a god LOL.
"Yea, my Aussie bud gave me 2-1 odds, and I was like ‘Well that’s an easy $10, cause c’mon, who’s even on the freakin Aussie team?’ Apparently, Patty Mills, that’s who."
" Not sure if it’s the best comparison, but I look at patty mills playing for the boomers like I remember Timmy Cahill for the Socceroos.  Even if not our best player in every squad, he was talismanic for the team. Whenever he came on, I believed he could pull a miracle from somewhere. Patty is that player for me on the boomers"
Is team Australia Patty Mills better than team Argentina Manu Ginobili?
Josh Green (Mavericks)  Will Magnay (Pelicans)   Matisse Thybulle (76ers)   Patty Mills (Spurs)   Aron Baynes (Raptors)   Dante Exum (Rockets)   Matthew Dellavedova (Cavaliers)  Joe Ingles (Jazz)
"It’s crazy how much the World has improved. Nigeria could have Giannis, Bam, Dipo and Dinwiddie I think. Australia has the Olympic legend Patty Mills and Ben Simmons. Canada has RJ, Wiggins, Dort, and TT I think. France will have Gobert, Fournier and Victor soon. The US is proving that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole."
I don’t hate any player but if I had to do a favourite star player and least favourite…  Favourite: Olympic Patty Mills  Least Favourite: Ben Simmons when he chooses not to play for Australia.
I literally said the warriors are better ? What do you think I’m arguing lmao. I’m just saying the nets can have a better offense than the warriors because their role players are more offensively slanted. The warriors didn’t have anyone like joe Harris patty mills and Blake. They had iggy and dray who were the backbone of their defense
"Okay but we all acknowledge the united states has the best players. Why is it so far fetched to think they can't come together and just win? In all fronts of 1v1, I'm talking lillard vs top world pg, bam vs top center (prob gobert since jokic didn't play). How the hell did gobert get extra practice time during the season with France? How about patty mills he's a vet on the spurs practically no PT during the season but he's starting for Australia and raining 3s? I'm talking just ball dawg how is it a struggle for the best players in the world it should be like varsity vs JV"
"Fuck, I did skip over them.  They don't have any active ones though unless I am completely missing one. Kawhi didn't sign a 3rd contract, Patty Mills was drafted by Portland, and the big 3 are retired now."
"I want to see them healthy this year. They’re such a pain in the ass, but so entertaining to watch. Even Blake has become like a 4th star with his amazing hustle plays in the playoffs.   EDIT: Forgot they added Patty Mills, man does it suck to be in the league against them 😭"
"Just peeked at the Spurs roster - remembering they lost DeRozan (their leading scorer), Patty Mills &amp; Rudy Gay (arguably their two best guys off the bench) - and it's looking a little dire. Dejounte Murray &amp; Doug McDermott are probably their top two scorers this season - maybe Derrick White too? Spurs were last in 3pt shots made &amp; attempted per game &amp; 24th in 3pt%. ""McBuckets"" will help with that, but I think at this point the Spurs might be best just to Choke for Chet (Holmgren).  Orlando seems to have a slew of players who aren't really starter material yet but someone's gonna have to do it. Where's their offense coming from, guys who can't stay healthy?"
"RJ is right. Klay has way more 1 on 1 game more than that of Joe Harris, Bogdanovic, Danny Green type for sure.. that’s why I always hate the comparison of Klay being a 3nD player..He was a legit all star with star attributes.  That being said tho, Warriors case for being the best brand comes from their star players identity that came with the pre existed foundation of ball movement, screen, cuts, motion offense smart making move off the ball… KD can fit in anywhere with any system. We also got to see the Warriors beautiful brand of basketball since 2014-15 and had 3 seasons with KD in that system.   We barely got to see a full strength Nets altogether. Nets do have some elements of an off ball plays, there are plenty of plays where Kyrie and KD screen for each other’s to either create mismatch on switch or to beeline for the lay up off miscommunication.. I think given time Nets will come to their identity of all around well offensive juggernaut that can kill anyone in Iso, PnR, ball movement… hell even Harden was cutting without the ball in the series against Boston.. there is also so much more shootings on this team than GSW. KD, Kyrie, Harden, Harris, Patty Mills… that’s just absurd spacing all around  even if Joe Harris can be a brick layers in Playoffs they can afford it"
"Lebron is at worst the 2nd best player of all time, you cannot compare what teams do with him to any other star players.  Giannis is very likely to get his number retired by the Bucks but its because of a lot more than just 2 years.  Butler isn't close to getting his number retired anywhere either.  If Kawhi did what he did on a team without much past success (like the raptors) then sure he might get it retired but even thats not guaranteed.  The Spurs are one of the most successful organizations in the league and 2 years of elite level play is not enough to get his number retired, and yes you can only look at those 2 otherwise by your logic a guy like Patty Mills should get it retired too because he was good in his role too"
"I’m pretty sure we have the full TPMLE, whereas Brooklyn iirc used them all on Patty Mills."
"we ain't tanking. we just parted away with our three vets in rudy, demar, patty that sadly where damaging more than helping us, stats speak. with damaging i just mean they were kinda ballhoggin. we have added doug that would substite demar, luka samanic will substite rudy, tre jones will substite patty mills. all our young guys gained another year of improvements. we get derrick white back, arguably our best player and definitely our most complete and experienced one. we get guys like collins and landale that can be solid pickups. so we gain ton of shooting, easily our biggest problem last year. and this to exclude thaddeus youngn who i think we will deal before the season starts for picks and maybe a young guy. and we still have pop.  i mean, i doubt we will be much worse as everyone predicts. let's see."
Jazz @ Spurs and Nets @ Spurs for Rudy Gay and Patty Mills return games
I got beef with Patty Mills too. I asked him to bundle with me at anytime fitness so I can save $4 a month and he backed out last minute
"JaKarr Sampson, the only person on planet earth to have beef with Patty Mills."
"Send over Murray/Walker/Johnson/3 firsts/pop/prime manu/bruce bowen/Patty Mills/Becky Hammon/Rudy’s take out and a 2024 2nd round pick swap, and he’s yours."
"“His stats were heavily restricted in Pop's system early on, he used to build all the Spurs leads and then once they were up 10, 20 after he had scored like 20pts in 20 mins on 80% shooting he'd either get benched or Pop would start running the offense through Patty Mills-DG-LA or some shit lol.”  This the most lying-ass, dick-eatin-ass shit I ever read lmfao no way u typed that with a straight face"
"&gt;I also agree Kawhi has been playing great as of late. But my point is that he didn’t even need to play that well on the teams he was on before the clippers and they’d still win even more games  As someone that has watched Kawhi his whole career I can tell you he had a major part in his team's regular season success.    His stats were heavily restricted in Pop's system early on, he used to build all the Spurs leads and then once they were up 10, 20 after he had scored like 20pts in 20 mins on 80% shooting he'd either get benched or Pop would start running the offense through Patty Mills-DG-LA or some shit lol.    He really carried them in 2016-2017, dude went god mode.  The big 3 were on the verge of retirement by 2014 playing less than like 30mpg so it's all very misleading without context.    Btw Kawhi has been a winner at all stages of his career, he led major upsets in high school and college."
Patty Mills- turning it on during olympics
Patty Mills 😭😭😭😭😭
"Patty Mills and ""Slim creeper"" Aleksej Pokuševski"
People overlooking my boy Patty Mills look at that win percentage.  The Spur boys in full force
Patty Mills vs Clippers  MPJ vs Clippers
Patty mills
So that means patty mills will be in the hof?
"We’ll see. To me Kyrie is really the only real injury risk and Patty Mills is a serviceable replacement for him. But it’s possible Harden is at the start of his physical decline and if that’s the case than yeah, all bets are off"
Mike Conley and Patty Mills
"They also have Patty Mills, Joe Harris (Nets win it all if he doesn’t underperform for no explicit reason), and some solid role players"
"IDK why so many people think the spurs have a chance at being the worst team in the league. We went 6-5 without DeMar this year, Patty played bad in the second half of last season, and we replaced Rudy Gay with Thad Young. I expect us to be only a few wins worse than last year.  We basically replaced Patty Mills with Bryn Forbes, Rudy Gay with Thad Young, and DeMar DeRozan with Doug McDermott. The biggest drop there is McDermott but he fits better with our roster, plus Derrick White missed half the season last year and he probably would've been our second best player last season if he was healthy."
Bro they already had the big three let's not act like Patty Mills takes them over the top
"Dude, Patty Mills doesn't make this team that much better than they were before. If anything losing Jeff Green is worse for them because he was basically a small stretch five and could switch onto multiple positions. Patty Mills is 6-1 and will get hunted on defense in a playoff series."
"Now he teams up with Harden &amp; Kyrie while being flanked by Joe Harris, a squadron of former ALL NBA players and Patty Mills.  Brooklyn Nets really looking like the greatest offensive team of all time."
"&gt; Warriors doubled KD when he was on OKC the last three games of that 2016   That's the exception to the rule. KD had ZERO shooters around him and the Warriors really really wanted the ball in Westbrook's hands. If you replace Westbrook with fucking Patty Mills then instead of taking a wide open midrange jumper and bricking it, you have Patty swish open 3 after open 3 (or if you guard him tightly too, you have no one under the rim and get demolished by Adams and Ibaka).   In that specific and unique set of circumstances, with literally the least efficient volume scorer in NBA's history taking more shots than KD, yes, it made sense to double KD just to have the ball in Russ hands, who would more often than not make the wrong decision."
We finna have Patty Mills vs THT now thanks a lot OP
"Wait, what casino incident?  And at least there’s Patty Mills is still representing"
patty mills just spat his weetbix out reading that
"their only other issue is they didn't grow up on the FIBA Rules and Courts like all of the guys outside North America, so they are less likely to have the guys like Patty Mills or Ricky Rubio that hit another level in FIBA competition. Most of the Canadian guys are brought into the AAU Circuit and playing with the American guys from a young age, so in some ways they are ""USA-lite"" with a big population disadvantage (although it only takes 5 on the court, so can't rule them out entirely, if they can get another guy that hits NBA MVP level like Steve Nash back in the day)."
"Nets get an A- for bringing in Patty Mills(awesome addition) and James Johnson, while losing Jeff Green and not addressing any defensive concerns? I’d give them a C, then again, a lot of teams got a weird grade."
All I'm hearing is that my Patty Mills auto is worthless on eBay. RIP
"Excellent point!  I mean, with positionless basketball, it is hard to pin down what position each guy really plays.   Is Draymond a point guard? He sets up plays?   If we listed Harden as a point guard, then yes. The Nets have, hands down, the best point guard rotation.   But I would personally categorize Harden as a shooting guard.   But you raise a valid point.   As for Mills, well... he's a solid play, but he isn't much of a play maker and ergo not much of a 'point guard.' I suppose he's comparable to Pat Beverly, but in that context, I give the edge to Beverly.  But that's a close call that could go either way.   With regard to Memphis, though, they have three solid point guard (pure point guards) who are all cheap.   If we put Harden as a point guard in BK (which is reasonable), then their point guard rotation takes up over $80 million, and almost $90 mill with Patty Mills.   Point taken though. And I'd happily agree to put Memphis at the #2  point guard rotation if we are including Harden as a point guard :)"
"Patty Mills does this...everywhere. Players or coaches drag him to the back. You can ask any Fan that's been to any Spurs game home or away, they have a Patty Mills autograph."
5x patty mills.
Will he properly develop on the Nets tho?  They got Harden/Kyrie and then Patty Mills now
Replace Lowry with Patty Mills  Edit: second thought I'd go with Haliburton
"Yeah I’m gonna have to go with both of the blazers picks in that draft. Gary is gonna be a bonafide stud. Reminds me somewhere between Wesley Matthews and Patty Mills type of play, but somehow even more aggressive.   And then there’s Anfernee Simons, dunk champ. Absolutely spring loaded, fast shot, just young and just coming into his NBA body. If Billups focuses on more team ball movement, Simons will thrive. He’s not a great ISO player, but he can find ways to get open."
Best game I’ve seen in person was Patty Mills defeating Team USA in Melbourne in 2019
"Come on, you can't list 4 of an all star 5 then say etc, put some respect on Patty Mills name."
"this is an insulting question lol, he's in the conversation for GOAT and if you don't have him #1 , he should be your #2 without question  The rings argument is so dumb honestly, let's put Bill Russell as GOAT then. Phil had a prime MJ and Scottie for all 6 rings. A prime Shaq and prime Kobe for 3 rings and a prime Kobe and prime Pau for 2 rings.  Pop had prime Duncan for 4 rings, prime Parker/Ginobili for 2 rings (05, 07), and a pretty good Drob for one ring (99). 2014 he had a lot of good talent, but no one really in their prime.   Pop has actually coached through multiple eras and shown an ability to adjust and BUILD a team. Phil has proven that if given all the pieces, he can take them to a ring (which is important).   Who did Phil actually develop? Did he develop Shaq? Kobe? Pau? Pop developed so many countless guys from Manu, Parker, Kawhi, George Hill, Baynes, Gary Neal, Patty Mills, Danny green, etc.   At the end of the day I think if you give Pop and Phil an identical set of 5 players, Pop will get the most out of them."
Patty Mills for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice(?) award (the one Melo won)
Patty Mills.. been fkn solid for a decade..
"Look no further than NBA champ Khris Middleton.  Or Australian Michael Jordan, Patty Mills."
"Fatty Mills, before he became PATTY. Towel waiver extraordinaire."
"Nick Collison from OKC, Patty Mills (though not sure he counts since he is a good player too)."
"Ooooooo also Patty Mills, but we all know he’s the GOAT in Brooklyn rn."
… but Patty Mills is in fact our PM.
Tatum wins mvp  Ja Morant leads the Grizz deep in the playoffs   Patty Mills win 6man of the year   Giannis averages a triple double  Nets/Lakers final
"That’s pretty terrible bias lol. Players can improve, especially a guy who was born in only 97….(god I’m getting old) .he was relegated to a role to fit the players around him because they had *garbage* spacing , and for whatever you mention about screens? Still was above an average defender . Certainly better then Ingram and Zion.   He’s a pretty ideal fit for almost any team in the NBA because he can be a big iq pg and catch and shoot, being versatile is a skill. Just because you do something for the better of your team doesn’t mean you can’t do more.   Olympic patty mills is a great recent example."
The same stat that says Patty Mills is better than Joel Embiid and Seth Curry is better than Kawhi and Draymond
Idk if it’s ironic. If he followed it up with a “we’re definitely going to win a championship have you seen our roster and our signing of patty mills” then definitely
that's  some david lynch shit  it just needs some eerie notes on a keytar being played by [patty mills...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxw2FZBd7aY)
Patty Mills
"Isaiah Thomas deserves another shot, he has worked his ass off, and since his injury has never been given another serious chance to contribute to a team. I’m not suggesting he will be the same MVP player, but I feel he is capable of coming off the bench and creating some quick needed offence, similar to patty mills"
The team with Patty Mills
"Silly take, you swapped matchups to fit a narrative.   Kyrie vs Steph is =   We’ve seen them play eachother. Kyrie is cold in big moments as a number 2 guy.   Draymond wasn’t anything special that year to be better than Joe Harris (best shooter in the league) and Blake + Patty mills."
Potentially yes Harden and Harris beat Klay and Draymond all day.   Not to mention they have Blake and Patty mills now
"I think yours are really good. I might be a little biased as a Suns fan, but:  **WEST**  1. **Phoenix Suns -** The Suns are bringing back basically the same team with better depth at center (McGee). I think the playoff experience from last year will push the younger guys to reach new heights this season, so I'm expecting big improvements from Ayton, Bridges, Payne, and Johnson. The Suns have an extremely balanced roster and are really deep, but a lot of this hinges on Ayton and Bridges stepping up this season. 2. **Los Angeles Lakers -** I had the Lakers #1 before the Westbrook trade, but I think he makes them worse. I'm never going to discount a team that has LeBron and AD, but the spacing is just awful here with Westbrook, they are one of the oldest teams in history, and Westbrook is extremely ball dominant - the more he has the ball, the less LeBron and AD have the ball. This team just isn't balanced well, although there's a lot of talent at the top. 3. **Utah Jazz -** The Jazz are obviously a great team and improved by bringing Rudy Gay in. They, along with the Suns and Lakers, are in my top tier for this conference and should compete for the #1 seed. I'm still skeptical of their playoff performances and I'm interested to see how Conley does this year. They don't quite have the talent that the Suns and Lakers do, in my opinion. 4. **Golden State Warriors -** I'm actually a little nervous putting the Warriors this high. They ended up 9th last season, so in order for them to get home court advantage, Klay Thompson really needs to come back to full form. After seeing Durant's recovery I believe he can do it. I think having Curry, Green, and Thompson back together will lift the team's morale and push them to be better than they otherwise would be, but they still don't have great depth or big men. Iguodala isn't very good anymore. 5. **Denver Nuggets -** Jokic is amazing and Porter, Jr. should continue to improve, but it's hard to see the Nuggets getting home court advantage with Murray missing most of the season. They are a good team, but were demolished by the Suns - yes, I know Murray was out, but Barton actually played really well when he played and they were just clearly the worse team. 6. **Dallas Mavericks -** I really like the addition of Reggie Bullock. He provides defense and more three-point shooting around Doncic. They still need other creators outside of Doncic, but they should be better than the Blazers and Clippers. I'm interested to see how Porzingis looks this season. 7. **Portland Trail Blazers -** It's really hard to know where to put the Blazers. They didn't really make any roster changes, so I can see Lillard being traded at some point this year, which obviously changes things. With that said, they should still make the playoffs and have a solid starting lineup, even with terrible defense. 8. **Los Angeles Clippers -** I was really surprised that the Clippers retained both Jackson and Batum. Huge win for them. They fought really hard in the playoffs, but I'm not convinced they can play that well (Jackson in particular) for an entire season. This is going to be a tough battle for them, but I think they'd win the Play-In over the Grizzlies or Pelicans. As a Suns fan, I would really hate to play the Clippers in the first round (if the standings work out this way).  **EAST**  1. **Brooklyn Nets -** If the Nets are healthy they have one of the most talented rosters in history, especially since they brought back Griffin and Brown and managed to add Patty Mills. 2. **Milwaukee Bucks -** They have a real shot at defending their title. Just a great, well-rounded team and they have Giannis. 3. **Philadelphia 76ers -** Yes, they lost to the Hawks in the playoffs, but they also had the top seed last year and will be really good again this year. It's going to change based on what happens with Simmons, but they have a lot of talent and should compete if Embiid stays healthy. 4. **Atlanta Hawks -** They had an amazing playoff run last year, Trae Young and the other young guys should continue to get better (especially if Hunter is healthy). They're bringing back essentially the same team and McMillan will have a full season as the coach. 5. **Miami Heat -** Lowry is a great third-man after Butler and Adebayo. If healthy they've proven they can be a really good team and win in the playoffs.  6. **New York Knicks -** The Knicks surprised everyone last year and then improved their team this year. They only had three guys that could score 20 points in a playoff game last year (Randle, Rose, and Barrett), but just added two more (Walker and Fournier). If healthy, they've really shored up their shot creation issues and should be much better in the playoffs. 7. **Chicago Bulls -** The Bulls added a lot of talent and will have a full training camp to get Vucevic incorporated. The defense is awful, but they will be really good on offense. LaVine took a huge step last year, but now he has Ball and DeRozan to take some pressure off of him. 8. **Boston Celtics -** Schroder was a great signing, but I just don't see how the Celtics are any better than last year, while other teams got better. Tatum and Brown are amazing, but the rest of the roster is just meh. I think those two are good enough to sneak into the playoffs, but they could have a tough time against the Hornets, Pacers, or even the Wizards."
"I hope Patty has a Reddit account and I hope he gets a chance to see this.  Patty Mills is an amazing human being first.  What he does for Australia and the aboriginal people there is beyond amazing, and if he were able to answer me, he would probably say he doesn't do enough.  He's an amazing Austrailian, and he is one of the top 10 NBA players of all time when he wears the Austrailian colors, and you can tell how proud he is to represent his country.  Next, he was an amazing Spurs fan and player.  Think back to early Patty Mills, he would use that towel to whip up the bench into a frenzy and everyone was excited when Patty was around.  Lastly, he was a key member of some of our greatest games ever played.  Patty, if you see this know that I talk to my two sons about you and I use you as an example of what you can do positive with privilege and how each of them can make the world a better place just by caring more and loving more.  Spurs fan since 1988."
Lol have you ever read anything from Aboriginal Australian people? Or even Patty Mills and how his family and ancestors have been treated over there throughout the years. This is absolutely not just an American issue.
"Incredible series. Tony Parker was possessed. Also it felt like we got to know the supporting casts for both teams super well. Ray Allen, Mike Miller, Mario Chalmers, Birdman Andersen,  Shane Battier, Rashard Lewis, Patty Mills, Danny Green, Boris Diaw, Gary Neal, Tiago Splitter. What a collection of role players!"
"Yea sure that’s agreeable but look at the original comment you responded to, I said they might not use their mle and at that point there wasn’t anybody worth using it on. Patty mills and batum had already signed by then. They would have used it on one of those if they could have, but there was no one else available who was really worth it"
"Us nets fans have been conditioned to view the start of free agency as our championship.   I think people havnt fully accepted that we have the players we need and there wasn’t much we could do in the off-season.  Resigning Blake and Bruce Brown was huge, our new signings were exactly what we needed, patty mills just puts it over the top."
"It feels like everybody thinks the Nets had a great off season except a lot of Nets fans themselves. Atleast on Nets Twitter, things are a little more positive now with the extension talks but there was some debate early on about what we were doing outside of the Patty mills signing."
Yeah he lost me at blowing the nets for grabbing patty mills james johnson and retaining kd. They are still the favorites but like Zach has a serious boner for em rn
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
“fan favorite” truly is an understatement about how much spurs fans appreciate him!!  some of the loudest situations ive ever experienced at the AT&amp;T center have been in response to an exciting Patty Mills play at a clutch moment
"Seriously contemplating if our team-developed 2014 finals mvp is worthy of having his jersey retired? Im sure It’s going to wait until his career is over, but he was a spur before he was with any other major league team, and he got his first championship here. Patty Mills was more than influential in his time here, he was a cornerstone of our second unit, right along manu ginobili. I can see how it’s questionable from an outside perspective, but the Spurs organization and its fans know what Patty Mills means to us."
"As a german guy, I'm really disappointed he didn't join the german olympic team. They made it to the Olympics for the first time since 1992 and he didn't play because of ""insurance"" reasons.  It would have been a good chance for him to show off his skills.  Now compare that to Patty Mills who played his heart out for his country and took so much pride to lead the boomers to a medal."
"Crazy story about a former coworker from HEB, a Texas grocery chain. My friend and his friends were having drinks at this outside bar and see Patty Mills having a drink alone. They invite him into their circle. After that, they invite him to his house in the hood and he actually comes through to hang out with them. If he didn't have pictures, I wouldn't have believed him."
"&gt;You expect Mills to be our franchise player?  I don’t mean that Patty would have been the franchise player if he stayed, I’m saying we lost Patty who was the cultural/leadership franchise player while we didn’t have much to show for it after.   If we lost DeMar and Patty but got a franchise player in the trades, even a developing but notable star talent, it would be easier to stomach. But we seemingly got fuck all in it all.   This org definitely has it in them to make diamonds out of fuck all, and I’ll be extremely happy to be wrong when that happens. That still won’t retroactively make it feel any better right here right now. In that future I will like what they have done up to now better, but that won’t make me right now feel any different.   I’m not claiming to be speaking rationally or objectively. This is 100% opinion and emotions. I’m just sad that we lost Patty, a beloved Spur, our last champion, and as of right now have fuck all to show for it."
You expect Mills to be our franchise player ? I’m more excited for this season without Patty then before. I want to see our young core. I want to see a new look Spurs. We are rebuilding. What we had was awesome. But you got to watch the new team prosper.   Patty deserved to leave and not be stuck in a rebuild. Idk what your talking about not having a franchise player when that is the most exciting part. Seeing who steps up to the plate.
"From towel-waver to FIBA Legend.... Gotta love the Patty Mills journey!    As much as I dislike the Nets, best of luck in Brooklyn Patty! You deserve every bit of success."
I know all I did was be from the same country as patty mills but man it makes me so proud to see the love he gets from fans/players/teams.
"Look at Patty Mills, balled the fuck at the Olympics with 40 points in the bronze medal game against Slovenia and now he’s going to sit on the bench in Brooklyn and watch James Harden and Kyrie Irving"
Its Patty Mills
Patty Mills and The Best tall af defender
“None of the people I directly interact with face to face seem to be talking about Patty Mills! My Uber driver this morning had no idea what I was talking about!”
"Honestly, I had no idea what team Patty Mills signed with, nor did I know he was a free agent. There was so much other basketball news that people were posting about it in this sub."
"Patty Mills is an underrated signing but in terms of teams he would help most specifically the Nets are at the bottom of the list. Was talking to one of my friends who's a big Nets fan the other day and he was like ""Yeah biggest thing Im hyped about is we kept him off the Lakers who couldve used him alot more lol"".  He'll help in the reg season big 3 never actually all play together but in the playoffs not nearly as much."
"If everyone on the spurs stays healthy, I expect us to have a similar win percentage. Losing Patty Mills is not a big deal imo - he was bad the second half of last season. Losing DeMar is pretty big but if Derrick stays healthy, he will make up a lot of his production and the spacing should be better this season for Keldon with McDermott on the roster and with Bryn back. Gay is a big loss too but Thad Young is a pretty comparable level player. I also expect the wolves to make the playoffs if they stay healthy though."
Seeing these lineups furthers my confusion why Patty signed in Brooklyn over the Lakers or Milwaukee.  Brooklyn does have the best shot at a title (if healthy).  But I don't see him making his way into closing lineups for the Nets.  Whereas I could easily see Mills-Brodie-Ariza-James-AD or Mills-Jrue-Khris-Giannis-Lopez lineup.
Can someone explain why patty mills got such a small contract. Only 19mil I believe. Shouldnt this dude get more than 60?
"Yeah, and the Spurs who played more than 10 minutes in that game were LaMarcus Aldridge, Jonathon Simmons, Danny Green, Pau Gasol, Patty Mills, Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, and Manu Ginobili. Ginobili was 39, Gasol was 37, and Murray was 20. That may be slightly better than what Houston had, but not by enough that they should have lost by almost 40 points."
"patty mills indigenous basketball legend. also, that pic with pop is straight up wholesome af."
"I would do anything with Patty Mills.   Anything!  I want to be near him, I want to be him, I want to wear him like a second skin."
Pop is a good egg. Patty Mills is also an outstanding human being. He does so much good work for the local communities. During the Allstar break last year he flew home and got solar panels installed for a communtiy that was ravaged by the recent bushfires.
"I can only think of D. Rose and Jordan Clarkson.. maybe TJ McConnell, Jalen Brunson,  and Patty Mills are arguable. Coincidentally I do like Malachi Flynn too."
Not for $20m for just next season. Contenders are signing contributors like Patty Mills for $12m/2yrs.

I first read “Patty Mills might be the Petty King”
His disappointment when I believe Patty Mills goes under the big. He though he was running up to foul lmao
I liked watching Ginobli and patty mills shooting the lights out when people said the rematch was going to the Heatles. They shouldn’t have even won the first time against them.
"Given how strict Australia is about COVID, I’m taking the ultimate contrarian pick with Patty Mills"
"It’s taking two 10 second, out of context sound bites from two separate post game interviews and protrays those clips as the only negative thing either Doc or Joel said. Honestly, Joel was much harsher on their effort and game plan than he was of Simmons and Doc’s presser was just flat out bad but acting like what he said about Ben was the most inflammatory statement is a mischaracterization, imo.   Plus, as someone who has said Simmons needs another ball handler alongside him like a Patty Mills type player if you truly want him as a primary ball handler on your team, saying “I don’t know if Simmons can be a PG on a championship team” is just expressing a view that most Sixers fans already believe. Even pairing Simmons and McCollum or Brogdon would work, but having him share the court with Embiid and Harris just exposes his weakness in the half court even more so than if there was another capable PG on the roster."
"KD/Dray would be elite defensively.  They would close games regular season games and play the majority of playoff games as the 4 and 5.  Both would be able to switch out onto the perimeter as well as provide elite rim protection.  A team having one player capable of defending 1-5 is a great advantage, having 2 is almost a cheat.  On offense KD is the easiest superstar to build around because he can do everything and doesn't need to dominate the ball.  While Curry is also a superstar who doesn't dominate the ball, KD's versatility/adaptability is greater.   Dray on offense without Curry would be a question mark.  His role as a pass-only big would be severely limited without Curry and Klay running off screens, handoffs and the patented Curry/Dray pick and roll.  Durant would of course alleviate some of that, but not much.  Pairing Dray/Durant with off-ball players like Jazz Bogdan, Nets Harris, Lou Dort, Patty Mills etc would give Draymond more playmaking options/duties to offset his scoring weakness.  Steph/Klay would be elite offensively and might be the easier PAIR to build around since BOTH players could fit with nearly any star.  Their out of this world shooting and off-ball threat would provide spacing and generate an elite offense.  The only problem would be, defense.  While Klay is a very good defender and Curry is anywhere from average to good, they both lack the position, size and wingspan to be impactful, difference making defenders.  Filling out this team would require good versatile switchable defensive bigs and wings which in the current NBA is a limited commodity, especially if you want one that can also shoot threes."
"He, kyrie, and harden don't need to play.    Patty mills, Tyler Johnson, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin is a good lineup."
"Yup. Along with a mini Patty Mills statue on Pop's statue's shoulder, Patty is if course waving his towel"
"Mike Conley  Patty Mills  Jrue Holiday  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Boban Marjanovic  Is your list a joke OP? Derrick Rose said some kind of messed up stuff at a trial, Steven Adams has been voted one of the dirtiest players in the league, Bobby Portis punched a teammate, and a lot of people don't like how much Luka Doncic complains about calls."
"Starting 5: Jokic, Jerami Grant Middleton, Smart, Steph. Bench: Ingles, Patty Mills, Seth Curry, Caruso, Marcus Morris, Naz Reid, PJ Tucker, Jaden McDaniels"
Right. And patty mills has had a long successful NBA career
Olympics is a completely different beast than the nba. You shouldn’t take his olympics success as a indicator for nba success at all. There is a reason why patty mills looks like an all star in the olympics but is just a good 6th man in the nba.
"Is RAPTOR all that reliable in this context? I'm looking at the numbers for 2019-2020 and the placements seem pretty dubious. Zubac and Beverley over Embiid, Poetl and Patty Mills over Murray/Trae/CP3.  I wonder how well it controls for differences in team context. Those results certainly scream of some flaw in the formula."
"Honestly probably team 2 Harden almost won with   Cp3 Harden Ariza Pj Clint  Bench:EG and Luc Mbah amoute    Now you upgrade cp3 to Kawhi, add a prime Danny green instead of luc and patty mills over EG   Would be very close but I think team 2 in 6 if MDA is the coach and they continued to run the switching defense system to slow down Steph and klay."
"&gt;Neither team has taken the easy way out the way the Warriors did.   LMFAOOOO okay. Ig signing KD, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, and trading for James Harden ain't the easy way? I hate the Lakers more than I hate the Nets, but you're out of your mind if you have a problem with the Warriors signing KD on top of their homegrown core that they built through good drafting and development, but no problem with a bunch of superstars grouping up together in Brooklyn, literally involving the same guy you had a problem with in Golden State."
"Patty Mills, Jayson Tatum, and Rudy Gobert made me spit out my milkshake"
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris, Mccollum, Brook Lopez with Donte Divencenzo, Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen off the bench  Vs.  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills with Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown and Lemarcus Aldrige off the bench.  Bucks match pure talent and probably win team fit here too. Second option is much worse from Harden to Jrue but Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie because of his defense and how valuable shooting is rn, while the Bucks have a better bench and Mccollum absolutely blows Joe Harris away as a player."
Olympic Patty Mills and Luka Doncic
"Well I'm certainly less skeptical about the Nets than the Lakers. Our top 3 are definitely the best in the league and getting Patty Mills was huge. If the big 3 are healthy then yeah the chances are high to beat the other eastern teams in the playoffs. But just watching so many teams collapse in the playoffs makes me nervous. Mostly worried about relying on the front court guys. Worried about Blake's knees, Millsap is aged and not what he used to be at all (though he is still a smart player, he is noticeably slower lately), and also worried about Aldridge's whole body given last year's retirement. Very excited to see Claxton with another offseason of improvement under the belt, though he is still so young.  Lakers supporting cast still has to prove it imo. They basically have a whole new team outside of LBJ/AD and I think we need to see how it all fits before we assume they will walk to the Finals too. They've got recognizable names but their shooting and C depth is very questionable. But even if it doesn't fit that well in the reg season people will still say it will change in the playoffs lol.  Bottom line is I just prefer to reserve my judgement until we see some basketball. Especially with the rag tag group of mercenaries the Lakers signed."
That is patty mills
"Meanwhile just yesterday I was reading an article about Patty Mills where he talked about how Kobe was nice to him and took an interest in him even though he was a nobody.  (Men's Health, Australia, not sure of date - I was in a doctor's office waiting room.)"
Patty Mills!!
"I don’t think so, he’d be behind Patty Mills in the rotation. Granted, if Irving goes out for injury and/or personal reasons, sure. His best move is somewhere like, well, San Antonio or Atlanta"
"Yeah, Millsap, Blake Griffin, and Patty Mills are def in their prime"
"It also metter how you play those guys!   Moreover take the last allNBL league (which I just checked):   - Bryce Cotton the x3 MVP and Finals MVP, went to Italy for a short period and been just a good role player in 2018. We are not talking about NBA level, we are talking that the MVP in a top European league is just good, not great.  - Tyler Harvey, a second round pick that never turned into something, also him was a good role player in Germany, not a great player in tier 3 of my list;  - Nathan Sobey, also him seems a good player but not really a great player;  - Jock Landale, which is imho the best Aussie watched in the Olympics outside from Patty Mills;  - John Mooney, not really remembering him in Notre Dame, i only know he is now in Japan, another weak competition league.  We could argue as much as you want, I think there are some evidence, even without considering how teams plays, that NBL isn't the best league out there. Nut if you like it you are free to consider it higher on your personal rank. I just gave my impression and motivated my choice."
"Gotta love Nets fans getting all puffed with their plastic hardware out. Get back to us once u actually achieve anything.  Celtics gonna have a great season. Worth watching for bball fans.

"The Brooklyn Nets just got Patty Mills, who had 42 pts and 9 ast in the Olympic bronze medal game to help secure Australia’s first medal in Olympic basketball. Also the most stacked team in the league though, so you may get hate lol"
The Nets: two words - Patty Mills.
Patty mills
Patty Mills time in the playoffs.  We can bench Joe's ass if needed.  I think that pressure of having a replacement there to take his shots either breaks him or makes him sharper.  Either way I'm cool trading him for like a Myles Turner.  Joe is dead to me.
"Hopefully they both stay healthy because that would be a finals for the ages (no pun intended).  But I think Brooklyn has too many weapons that are more in their primes.  Even if you could imagine KD and Lebron equalizing each other, there’s still a match up issue with either harden (who can go off for 50 at any given moment) or kyrie (who can go off for like 40 at any given moment).    I think who is going to be really important - Claxton his defense is pretty good and necessary.   And the Lakers just aren’t that deep.  Idk if LMA signed with the nets yet, but if they get him, that’s a guy who can get his own bucket.   Patty mills is a tough stop.  Blake showed that he can play solid defense on bigger bodies and make smart plays.  Teams have a hard time figuring out the Bruce brown plays and then you have a consistent floor stretcher in Harris.  And I liked the Carter pickup, he’s a dog.  I never like to count Lebron out, but that nets team, if healthy, is pretty damn tough even if Westbrook averages a triple double."
"I’ve been watching 2013 Heat/2014 Spurs highlights. I grew up being a diehard Ray Allen fan so that Heat team was very fun for me to watch during that depressing time when my beloved Lakers sucked. And then the following year Patty Mills got a ring so that was fun. But yeah, pretty awesome to see Ray get a ring with a team that didn’t have Rondo or Paul Pierce on it.  Other than that, Magic Johnson’s first game is pretty cool to watch. Kobe’s dad is on the other team (pre-Sterling Clippers)."
"&gt;I actually see a lot of comparisons to basketball.

"&gt;Wherever I can **maximize earning opportunities both on and off the court.**  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;And that is why the Lakers should always be good at getting FAs. **A role player on the Lakers are better known by casuals than really good players off smaller market teams**. Kuzma has more advertising clout than Sabonis, and with the max contracts that advertising is where the money is left for stars to he made.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Not disagreeing with your core point but I feel like Sabonis is a bad example. He's a foreign player who talks very little. Everyone knows Patty Mills and Danny Green from their Spurs days, and at best you could call them elite role players there.  You brought up the general public in your first comment, but really the 'general public' doesn't really matter when you're a role player.  You're not making any money from the general public as a role player.   if you as a player are trying to 'maximize  earning opportunities both on and off the court' as the OP replied to the question 'f you were in the NBA and a free agent what would you prioritize the most in picking a new team' - well, outside of getting better and becoming next Kobe... what can you do?   You can maximize earnings even as a role player when you're on the team like the Lakers that can get you the followers, as Kuzma clearly have. Even Caruso had a few commercials and endorsements lined up."
They nearly beat the champs with one star healthy and they just added patty mills who other contenders wanted
Harden and KAI are still contenders if LMA can go the distance. They’re better this season since they signed Patty Mills and Millsap and Green are almost interchangeable.
Patty mills is revered in Australia
"Donovan Mitchell really grew on me - I couldn’t stand him during the whole rookie of the year debacle and thought it made him look like a massive sook.   I used to think Tim Duncan was the equivalent of watching beige paint dry. Obviously I was very young then and biased because the Spurs were the Lakers’ biggest competition and have grown to appreciate his playing (also he was on a team with Patty Mills who I love).   I used to hate Blake Griffin - thought he was overrated as hell (and he was on the Clippers) and a pretty boy.  Now I’m just kind of indifferent towards him.   Who knows … maybe in 10 years I’ll come to appreciate Luka (who right now I think of as the whingy obstacle to my country’s first medal, the soft and shiny individualistic “Wonderboy” contrasting the team-focused Aussies)."
Patty Mills is a huge get for them.   This could be THE move of the off-season if Mills balls out   Nets were one piece and one toe of KD away from the Finals
"I’d say Bruce Brown, Patty Mills and maybe Millsap could start on some teams. Cam Thomas could start on bad teams"
"Signed Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, James Johnson, got off Deandre Jordan’s contract and got a high potential player for him. Drafted Cam Thomas (summer league MVP) and Dayron Sharpe"
Patty Mills towel waving was a fun time

Blake has a solid open three shot, LMA has a solid elbow jumper, Patty Mills hits clutch threes and then you got the three stars. This team is even more talented than the KD Curry Thompson Iggy Dray, Warriors. Ridiculous"

"The Spurs are really good. Look outside of Kawhi or their stars. They turned an undrafted Bryn Forbes into a borderline rotation guy. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray were back to back 29th picks who became good rotation players. Going back even further, they basically resurrected Danny Green's career and made Patty Mills the guy he is today. Kawhi is the pinnacle of their development but they've done great work with a lot of players"
Thought he was the next Patty Mills.
"Duncan, Ginobli, Parker, Kawhi, Green, Diaw, Bellineli, Splitter, Patty Mills.    That was a fun team."
"Ima be honest, i can't see Jared Dudley's jersey getting retired and the only reason names like Collison and Haslem are brought up is because of their loyalty and they've been on their respective teams much longer than Patty. I know that San Antonio have some of the softest regulations on player jersey retirements in the NBA, but Johnson and Bowen were starters for longer periods of time than Mills.   Patty was a good to pretty good backup Point Guard for a decade, and being a fan favorite is definitely not something that makes you a shoe in."
"The Spurs had the least amount of 3PA attempts last year. While the Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson aren't knock down shooters, taking them out when you already lost Patty Mills and Rudy Gay leaves you with an absolutely nightmare. Bryn Forbes and Doug McDermott can help but neither of those guys are volume shooters. Due to Simmons being about the worst free point shooting guard in the regular season - at least 10% behind every other guard the last 3 seasons aside from Westbrook and RJ Barrett - where do the volume of points come from for the Spurs now? They won't scale at all by adding Simmons. If you want him to be the tank commander, fine, but I'm sure trading a combo of Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson next season will get you more in return to build around than Simmons.  Who cares if he got voted All Star? What does he bring that actually helps the Spurs improve or get to the playoffs?"
Patty Mills
"Under unfortunately,  probably 19 ,  They also lost   Patty Mills"
Patty Mills.  Spurs fans want to retire his jersey but I need a higher barrier for entry than a 7th or 8th man.
"Nets have depth too lol what  Their top 10 guys: Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, LMA, Bruce Brown, Millsap, Claxton.   James Johnson/Jahlil/Jevon Carter at the end of the bench"
If MPJ and Barton are marching Harden who is matching LMA and Joe Harris.  Or Patty Mills and Blake
are they any less talented than patty mills and joe ingles australia?
"Australia won a medal and only lost to usa, beat doncic's slovenia and would have fought for gold if not for usa   their best players are patty mills and joe ingles  is Detroit really worse in raw talent?"
"This is just not true. They had Patty Mills and Rudy Gay making basically the same money, the Raptors chose Danny Green. If the Spurs had a choice, I'm 100% sure they would have rather sent out Rudy Gay.  Edit: wording"
Patty Mills lol
"my point being is if raptors management had that same attitude towards FVV that you ave they probably don't have a championship.   FVV is also a 5'10/5'11 barefoot, and didn't have top end speed or burst. he didn't show the same range or volume in college that Carsen did shooting the ball. definitely a better playmaker, but FVV had very similar, if not more, limitations and absolutely was able to exceed all expectations   EDIT: i see youre not OP, but just saying thinking edwards was destined to be some failure is pretty dumb thinking. no one was saying he'd be a 20 pPG scorer like in college but definitely hd potential to be a patty mills type"
"which contender needs Dragic and would remain a contender if they trade away 20M in role player salaries?  I mean f.e. I guess the Sixers could use Dragic (when healthy and locked-in) but who would they send back? Danny makes 10M and Seth 8M .. are they still contenders if both of these players don’t work out and/or are injured? OK I guess with the situation with Ben the Sixers might not be the best example since we don’t know how they will look.  Same situation for the Lakers.  I guess the Clippers could want to flip Bledsoe but with what assets?  Bucks would need to want to move Lopez + X and at that point they would be in serious trouble.  But I guess you can go through the contenders and you will be hard pressed to find a team.  The only team besides the fringe contender Mavs that could put together enough salary without gutting their team could be the Nets if Harris gets injured .. but heck they have Patty Mils, they don’t need Dragic. And if Mills gets injured, they don’t want to ship a healthy Harris for Dragic."
If Luka had won Olympic gold year he’d be in free. Same deal with Patty mills
Yeah and Patty Mills is an MVP when he plays for Australia. Shit doesn't work like that in the NBA.
His Patty Mills comparison/point he made is pretty bad as well. While I agree he isn’t top 5 currently “no where close” is a bit of a stretch considering all the work he puts in. He’s become one of three (the other two being Jordan and Kareem Abdul Jabbar) players to have hit 300 points in their first 9 playoff appearances. His FG/FT percentages are absolutely incredible and the improvements hes made from the bubble playoffs to this years playoffs are so impressive as well.
But Pogba as a whole plays for United more than France. Patty Mills dominated internationally doesn’t make him a superstar on his team.
Australia has a much more stacked roster than Slovenia and it’s not even close. Luka came straight from the playoffs where he was playing 40.1 minutes per game.   Also he didn’t have better averages. But way to just make shit up and prove my point that you don’t know what you’re talking about lol.   Patty: http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/player/Patty-Mills  Luka: http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/player/Luka-Doncic
&gt;The man who almost singlehandedly took his country to an Olympic medal is over rated.  Patty Mills had better averages in the olympics than Luka and actually won a medal against Luka lmao. Is Mills a top 10 player in the NBA now  💀
Patty Mills is probably enough to say yes
James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  LaMarcus Aldridge  Patty Mills  Joe Harris  Paul Millsap  vs  one balding boii   lmfao the audacity
"definitely not a one for one, Jeff Green essentially got flipped for Patty Mills and Paul Millsap which i'd do any day"
Patty mills is actually better than like mike James or something who was just used to eat up regular season minutes. Millsap depends on the year he has but he should still produce on this team.
"I wasn’t addressing patty mills. I was addressing this specific post and the signing of Millsap. And specifically the role he will play and the person who vacated that role he will play.   It’s fine to think that Patty Mills makes you better than last year. But that is not what the OP is positing. OP is claiming that because Millsap is a former all star, suddenly the nets have upgraded from Jeff Green. Which I think is an incorrect take."
"Not to mention Harris, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Patty Mills, Blake..."
"No. It’s patty Mills and him, a win. We had mike James playing the point last off-season and we didn’t really any depth in the frontcourt"
We basically replaced him with patty Mills and millsap. I think it’s a win
"The tears in this thread are sweet, bunch of babies crying over the signing of a 37yr old.   Ill never feel bad about the nets being good, we’ve been a poverty franchise since the start.   Nets didn’t even have that good of an off-season, y’all are just so blinded by hate. Patty Mills is literally the only productive name we signed after losing 2 key contributors in FA. Like it’s literally not even close to comparable to LA who have vacuumed up half of the free agents."
Green is definitely better than millsap at this point of his career but the nets essentially chose patty mills and millsap over only jeff green. It’s a good flip imo
"A prime KD trumps a washed Griffin and Millsap, LMA who retired and Patty mills who is 33 and declining."
Nah we essentially chose patty mills and millsap over just jeff green. Good flip imo
I'm just salty they got patty mills
"Ancient Zaza &amp; Dwest (who was very good for the team tbf) are not really comparable to Blake Griffin, LMA, Patty Mills, Millsap....the Nets are getting a much higher caliber of FA/buyout talent"
Patty Mills towel wave and/or 3-point goggles
"I’m gonna guess Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, and Patty Mills"
"And instead of playing for his country where might’ve regained some confidence and some advice from Patty Mills, he turned up at the Wimbledon tennis with latest Instagram chick"
"From Aus here,      I've been watching the NBA for a good few years now, without really rooting for one team and with the 2020-2021 season having ended and the next season is coming up, I think it is the perfect time, maybe a bit late but hey, to start supporting a team. I watch AFL which is an Australian Football league, a unique game not found anywhere but here and it was easy to pick a team because of where I was born and what my family went for, but for NBA having not lived their only visited, is a bit harder.      Personally I've been thinking of supporting the Nets, having fellow Australian Patty Mills, and if you count him Aussie then Kyrie as well, would be a good choice having a familiar background being from the same country, but also thinking of going with Heat because of their all around future talent. I've also thought of some jersey designs of teams, but thinking it wouldn't be a big deal but something visually appealing, not entirely sure if that should be the cause though.      Maybe give me some heads up on picking or just leave your opinions, cheers!"
"They really just need their big 4 to be contenders, so getting to hang on to Blake Griffin and add Patty Mills is huge for them. I’d give them an A too"
"I think Nets are one of my favourites for 'winning' the offseason. Getting Blake Griffin back on a minimum makes me extremely bitter, Patty Mills should hopefully be a strong addition, but really all they needed to do was get KD/Kyrie/Harden to sign extensions and it's looking like they have so far.  That said, Jeff Green is a bigger loss than a lot will recognise imo."
"They didn’t sign much this off season. They let go of Jeff Green and signed Patty Mills in his place. If they get Millsap, they’ll probably let go of one of the deep bench."
Luka led the Mavericks (with very little help) to 7 games against the finals favorite Clippers. Luka also made the all-NBA first team.   Patty Mills did not.
He didn’t prove he’s top 5 lmao by that logic Patty Mills is top 5
Patty Mills 😍😍
Patty Mills looks great so far.
No because healthy Harden rn &gt; 2013 Harden  KD is still dominant  Obviously Kyrie is better than his 2013 self  Joe Harris and Bruce Brown are on the team  Patty Mills still does what he needs to do
"James Harden is better now than he was in 2013. Kevin Durant is just as good.  Patty Mills is still great, too."
"nets seem like they don't have a lot of depth  joe harris is OK but I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on him  blake griffin only does so much these days  patty mills is hot and cold  millsap and LMA are old and play very limited minutes  They definitely don't look like the world beaters everybody was projecting.  Even if harden gets back to how he was last season they're still gonna have poor depth  They need to get the kyrie situation resolved, either get him back on the floor or get his contract off the books and bring someone else in"
"what's the all time starting 5 of players who do NOT sound like they look?  KAT, Tim Duncan, Richard Jefferson, Patty Mills, Gerald Wallace, Evan Turner (for reasons)  &amp;#x200B;  who else?"
Yeah but the nets missed all their open shots as well so it works both ways. Particularly Patty Mills
Neither because they’re both ass.   Give me Patty Mills.
"Oh yeah I’ll always get behind lamelo just cause he played in the nbl but for me, giddey playing for my home city team and representing Australia, at the moment he can’t be topped as an Australian in the nba (maybe patty mills but it’s close)"
"&gt; But like I said, we've been generating great shots. We've been getting in the paint.  This isn't wrong, I think their shot quality has generally been OK, just seems like everyone besides KD and Patty Mills (depending on the night) can't hit anything."
Patty Mills??
Considering Patty Mills &amp; Joe Harris are on the team that shouldn't really be the case
"duncan, herro, and patty mills are 0-11 from 3 as predicted"
patty mills such a smarty pants
At this point in their careers Patty Mills &amp; Kyle Lowry provide the same impact on a team.
"Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, LMA, and Claxton is more than good enough to win a title with KD and Harden."
Patty Mills started that.
Nets rather pay Patty Mills with the MLE than give that to Jeff Green
Why hasn’t anyone tried to pair Evan Fournier with Ricky Rubio or Patty Mills? FIBA/Olympic goats
Patty Mills would be high per min.
"I shit you not, I one of my favorite things about Patty Mills is that he can't dunk by his own admission."
"PATTY MILLS BABBBEEEEEE AUSSIE GOAT (debatable between him + longley) and Simmons/Irving don’t count, they live in US since college/earlier"
"“Wait, ~~DeMar Derozan~~ / ~~Patty Mills~~ Spurs player is balling?” 🤔🔫 Always has…"
I definitely appreciate Patty Mills. He was a nice piece for that 2014 Spurs championship team too
"Indeed, Patty Mills is definitely uses to leadership."
I haven't watched the Nets mutch; how are Harden and Patty Mills managing point duties? IIRC Harden was running point and Kyrie moved to 2?
Id rather have Patty Mills than Kyrie
"Patty Mills: Important part of the 2014 championship and last player from that team to stay with us until last year, plus longest tenured Spur not named Big 3/Robinson/Gervin"
"Gary Trent JR looks like Patty Mills, no?"
Its ok he has patty mills
Friendship ended with Joe Harris  Now Patty Mills is my best friend
"Both Joe Harris and Patty Mills 3pt form will regress to the mean, but in the end Nets could have 2 great shooters for the season."
Patty Mills
"Steph, KD, Patty Mills"
Patty Mills an all star smhhh they can’t keep getting away with this
Patty Mills is nuts
Patty mills
Josh Giddey  Patty Mills  Matisse Thybulle   Josh Green  Jock Landale
As did the Patty Mills move to Brooklyn.
"Manu, Parker, Patty Mills were not boring"
"Irving, James Harden, Durant, Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap, Patty Mills, Aldridge. I can’t remember anyone else :/"
"Yeah this is how Patty works. Nba defense is worse? He’s not getting the same looks as fiba? He’s not as hyped for the nba season? Unclear, but this is the real nba Mills. He’ll hit some shots some games and have games like this in other games. Love his heart tho. Great leader."
"Yes, but is Patty Mills not above Joe Ingles?"
Patty Mills is best used against non-starters.
"Even better he probably stans Simmons who has still some how never suited up as a boomer. Philly and Simmons can get fucked. Imagine getting the chance to play with patty mills in his last Olympics and saying ""nah""."
Did Patty Mills die?
Patty Mills has been on fire tho
"This may be my misunderstanding but it’s weird that a boomerpatty username, which I’m assuming is a patty mills inspired name, would not apply the intersectionality to their comment about disenfranchised people not trusting science or federal government. Science is not with out it’s problematic history"
"Took one bad game for people to turn on Patty Mills, lol"
"We definitely look off but a lot of it is because it’s a different team.   Bruce Brown still looks great but Nash is trying a bunch of new lineups so he hasn’t been playing. (Looked great tonight)  Claxton just hasn’t picked up like we hoped yet but unless Harden was getting him lobs he always looked like this.   Harris looks really bad, that’s probably the main person who I’m worried about legit falling off.   LMA only played a handful of games for us last year but he and BG look more or less the same.   Losing Uncle Jeff sucks But Patty Mills has been really strong and getting stronger.   And obviously missing 35 mil in cap space doesn’t help, I’m sure you feel me there.   A big thing is Harden was responsible for getting our role players involved and in sync. And so far he’s been off. I’d say after the first 15 ish games we’ll have it ironed out. We have the personnel it’s getting the new pieces to gel."
Patty Mills is their best bench player
"And no other real playmaker. Nash is trying to make Jevon Carter and Patty Mills run the offense, but that shit just isn’t working"
Imagine going from playing with the Warriors to this team that doesn't move off ball at all  Literally every Net is a statue when they don't have the ball except for Patty Mills
Damn Patty Mills is quick
Is it jusst me or does Patty Mills have  very short legs for a basketball players?
MVP: Steph Curry  ROTY: Evan Mobley  Sixth Man: Lebron James.. Jokes aside: Patty Mills  DPOTY: Giannis  MIP: Mikal Bridges  Warriors in 6 against Bucks.
Season average? Lol.   Go talk about Patty Mills' greatest shooting season ever (average).
People think the basketball hall of fame is like the nfl hall of fame.. it isn’t. Dino Radja is in the basketball hall of fame and he played 4 seasons. Ricky Rubio and Patty Mills will both probably be in the basketball hall of fame because of their international performances and reputations. We shouldn’t gatekeep who gets in like the nfl and mlb do.
I know Patty Mills has a ring but lowkey him and the Spurs. Patty deserved to be a starter and a star player but Pop purely used him as a bench role player. I’m just saying that maybe FIBA Patty could have been his natural state if he just had more minutes.
Patty Mills:  Am I a joke to you?
patty mills has a chance even though he has taken no free throws
Patty Mills is shooting 70/100 but hasn't taken a FT yet lol. He actually has a very good chance of shooting 50/40/90 this year though
Patty Mills is 10-10 from 3 in the regular season.  What the fuck.
"What do the nba rules say, cause if you go and search for the landing rule on Nba video rulebook you can clearly see that shooters land 1-2 ft in front Look at this video, full of shooters landing in front Curry, Joe Ingles, CJ, Patty Mills, Graham, Jamal Murray, Beasly. https://youtu.be/IUDJpB9UbQc  In FIBA they state that your cylinder lenght is lenght of when you put ball in front of you with your arms half bent on your elbows, but in NBA that is in practice a little more. https://youtu.be/mMaAAANyP8Q from same game his foot moves for more than one shoe lenght which is easy more than 1ft."
"Brooklyn may have finally cracked it.  Step 1. Recruit Patty Mills straight after the Olympics and rush him to training camp before he has time to reorient himself.  Step 2. Rent a hypnotist, a few green and gold tracksuits and some character actors to play Exum/Ingles/Baynes  in the locker room. (Also hire a character actor to play Simmons but have him not show up like a little bitch.)  Result: Permanent FIBA Patty"
"To this day, nobody has seen Patty Mills and Gary Trent Jr in the same room together..."
Patty mills finals MVP over Harden and KD who says no
Patty Mills Hasn’t missed a 3 in over 5 months….
"Random thoughts  BRK defense is awful, their interior defense especially so, Claxton is cheeks rn, why they didnt sign a decent center this past offseason is beyond me  2 game sample size but BRK's offense looks better with Harden on the bench, big yikes atm and mildly concerning going forward  Joe Harris in playoff form rn  Patty Mills signing was one of the best offseason moves, dude brings shooting, perimeter D, and poise, all sorely needed   Harden Iso become less effective when the defenders not worried about getting called for a ticky/flop foul  Hardens lack of off ball movement is a problem, gums up/kill a lot actions because he just floats around the top of the key 3 point line, needs to work on back cutting for ez layups when defenders overplay him  If Kyrie doesnt come back KD's gonna have to hard carry this team, talk about shit you wouldnt have expected to say to start the season  Millsap and LMA do the same things for this team, why they felt the need to get 2 dudes why they felt the need to get 2 players with so much overlap at a position that isnt super important (the stretch 4-5) is kinda headscratching.  Also BRK needs wings badly, theyves got too many 4-5's and 1-2's.    LMA and Mills were the unsung heroes tonight, ex-Spurs carrying the Nets lmao  BRK has no answer for Embiid other than doubling/trapping on the perimeter or swarming him in the post Maxey looks solid, some  youthful hiccups but i can see why they wanted to keep him, RIP to Simmons lol  Still baffled why Dallas traded Seth, dudes the perfect spacer for any team looking to go on a deep playoffs run, and hes continued to add to his game  Sixers have an actual bench this year,  they wont hemorrhage leads as much when Embiid sit now  Sixers biggest issue imo is consistency, they have a hard time sustaining good play and tend to bounce between good runs and bad runs, their closing play also leaves a lot too be desired, wrong guys taking the shots down the stretch, also wayyyyyyy too many execution errors on both sides of the ball"
Patty mills the Aussie goat
? Patty Mills is playing even better
I'm just here to see if Patty Mills ever misses a 3 again.
"Huh? Patty Mills, LMA, James Harden are all good players.  The biggest issue is defense and the Claxton's inability to shoot but Claxton will be removed from the starting lineup come playoff time"
3 australians between these two teams and patty mills is the only one not throwing a temper tantrum
Imagine daring Patty Mills to shoot. someone needs to rewatch the 2014 finals
patty mills should teach his fellow aussie some mental fortitude
Patty Mills is incredible.  Seth Curry is also incredible.
Patty Mills not missing all season.
lol at emiid pushing patty mills aside like he's swatting a fly
Patty Mills out here trying to make the NBA reporters be more like Tim Kurkjian
...by players named Patty Mills.
"My dad loved always loved Mark Few and Gonzaga so he watched a ton of WCC games - he would always talk about how good Patty Mills was and I remember arguing relentlessly with him as a 13 year old that Steph would be the better player in the NBA. He was glad I was right after we drafted him, just wish he could've seen the MVP and championship seasons!!"
If Curry keeps this up he might usurp Patty Mills as the best shooter in the NBA
The Aron Baynes/Patty Mills/Any random scrub on their team special
&gt;Patty mills will shoot 100% from 3 this season   &gt;   &gt;The nets are not a playoff team.  Mills needs help.
Lamelo for mvp   Westbrook getting traded for Kyrie  Patty mills will shoot 100% from 3 this season  The nets are not a playoff team.  Curry will average a triple double  Giannis Is the better then lebron all time  (My overreactions)
"Bruh don't dishonor us like that, Jingles and Patty Mills own that"
"Patty ""This isn't even my final form"" Mills"
Washed ass bench   Patty Mills easily the 6th man
i'll just attack your country   Izzy azalea sounds like a dying kangaroo  Liz cambage smells like vegamute  Luc Longley looks like the monster from goonies  Matthew Dellavadova sniffs wombat poo  Ben simmons cries to a kylie jenner poster at night  the dingo did eat Patty mills baby  sean marks stinks
I may consider Patty Mills for #1. Nice you guys finally got a superstar!
"Nets are going to dominate the playoffs this year lmao. Kyrie will come back to role players like Patty Mills, Harris, Milsapp, Griffin, it’s literally unfair how good their role players are for a team with 3 top 15 guys"
"RIC: ahhhhhhhhhhh, lets talk about Patty Mills."
Patty Mills can't win with these cats
Patty Mills looking GOOD
"I mean, Patty Mills turned out alright."
Even though the Nets lost Patty Mills lookin really good for 7m
"\&gt;Mills looks fine  &amp;#x200B;  What game were you watching where you came away with Patty Mills looked just ""Fine"""
KD put up 32/11/4 and Patty Mills went 7/7 from three and they still lost by 23
Better than Patty Mills on the Nets?
Patty Mills is more than a JAG.  He's a Spur.
"Clippers after Steph checks out: ""Phew""  *sees Patty Mills checking in*  ""Oh for fucks sake"""
"reminds me a bit of patty mills w more ups , if i was a nets fan i’d be hoping he can develop into a quickley or maxey type player"
KD kick out to patty Mills for the win?
"If you don't love Alec Burks and Patty Mills, I dont like you"
Olympic Flag Bearer Patty Mills in shambles.
Patty Mills tbh
"Wait, does patty mills have the highest 3 point percent or does Jonas Valenciunas?"
Put some respect on Patty Mills name
"Am I crazy for thinking the Nets have solid roleplayers? This roster with just KD, two games of Kyire, and a one-legged Harden took the current champs to OT in 7 games. Now they’ve also got Patty Mills and LMA."
Patty Mills 7 3pters tonight confirmed
Kevin Durant and Patty Mills
"Unless the nets, warriors have a complete team. Their bench is really good. Who on nets beside harden KD and patty mills is good? Kyrie is being a bitxh"
"Teammates plural?  Our third best player is Patty Mills lol  Other title contenders' third best players are Jrue Holiday, Klay Thompson(when he comes back), and DeAndre Ayton  We have the much better #2 of course but thanks to Kyrie we pay a big price for that from #3 on down  If anything you seem to be obsessed with reiterating that the Nets are favorites just so you can clown us if we lose"
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
&gt;1. Jonas Valanciunas - 51.7% (58 total attempts) 2. Patty Mills - 50% (128 total attempts) 3. Joe Harris - 46.6% (88 total attempts) 4. Alec Burks - 45.1% (91 total attempts) 5. Bobby Portis - 44.4% (72 total attempts) 6. Norm Powell - 44.4% (81 total attempts) 7. Lonzo Ball - 44.4% (151 total attempts) 8. KAT - 44% (125 total attempts) 9. Doug McDermott - 43.9% (57 attempts) 10. Nic Batum - 43.8% (73 attempts)  From u/Mdgt_Pope
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
patty mills doing this with like 162 attempts is impressive
Patty mills the goat
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"Patty Mills and Joe Harris coming on strong too, but you won't see Nets praise in this sub, that's for damn sure."
"And out of the top 10, Jonas Valanciunas has the second least total attempts. Patty Mills has attempted over twice as many more attempts than him and still hold second in 3P%.   Sample size, baby."
"Wizards fan, so sorry.😂 The only one that may not be warranted is Kuzma. You could swap him for anyone else. KCP is a sniper this year (although I’m torn between him or Patty Mills) and Gafford has been vocal about wanting to be in the dunk contest."
I also get irrationally angry once a week or so that we didn't move heaven and earth to get Patty Mills instead of letting him go to the Nets. He would be absolutely perfect for us.
Patty Mills gotta be in 3 point contest
&gt;1. Jonas Valanciunas - 51.7% (58 total attempts) 2. Patty Mills - 50% (128 total attempts) 3. Joe Harris - 46.6% (88 total attempts) 4. Alec Burks - 45.1% (91 total attempts) 5. Bobby Portis - 44.4% (72 total attempts) 6. Norm Powell - 44.4% (81 total attempts) 7. Lonzo Ball - 44.4% (151 total attempts) 8. KAT - 44% (125 total attempts) 9. Doug McDermott - 43.9% (57 attempts) 10. Nic Batum - 43.8% (73 attempts)  Only person who's shot less than Valanciunas is McDermott.
Plus they have Patty Mills :(
"Wild how a roster of KD, James Harden, Joe Harris, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, and Patty Mills being the 1 seed by one game over the Wizards is considered impressive this year lol"
It’s become less about “the nets need to play horribly to lose” and more about “the nets need a lot out of Patty Mills to win”. The gap in talent just isn’t there without Kyrie.
"they nearly beat the bucks last year with harden on one leg, no kyrie, joe harris having a terrible series, and no patty mills or aldridge."
"different players can succeed in different situations and teams need different things. nets regularly run  a rotation of mills - bembry - brown - james johnson- millsap. We could swap mills out and put more of his time with harden and durant, and put kemba there to take a couple pull up mid rangers and try to do something in that time.   I am under no delusion that kemba is a good player. but our guard rotation is virtually non existent of ball handling right now. patty cant really do it, harden is our only point guard on the rsoter right now."
bro if you want to give some of patty mills minutes to kemba then god bless but I would highly recommend not doing that
"Yes he is a genuinely nice guy, I made a post before talking about my experience with Manu, Patty, Mills and Boris Diaw.   Great great guys. 100% genuine through and through.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/r4x2va/_/hmjy8q2"
"Don’t forget Joe Harris, and Aldridge, and Patty Mills."
"id say yes tbh. the nuggets roster is really depleted. so is the nets right now, but harden in his diminished state is still a decent player. then lamarcus aldridge and patty mills have been really good. harris has played most of the year and has been pretty good. right now we're banged up but we had a good 15 games of health."
"Are the Nuggets around Jokic that much worse than the Nets around KD? (Well, at least before MPJ went down?); Harden looks like ass and other than Patty Mills and spot minutes from LMA it's a team of fucking scrubs with Harris, Claxton and Kyrie all out for essentially the season.   Nets are #1 seed, Nuggets aren't even .500"
patty mills is currently the nets second best scorer so idk what ur getting at
Has less help? Harden been struggling sure but are you kidding me?  Patty Mills would be the warriors 4th best scorer as well.  Also steph play makes in a way KD can't
So honored right now. I was wondering if blumdiddlyumpkin would actually comment on me commenting on their comment on Montys comment on Patty Mills.
Dude hahahahaha! That’s so funny. Monty just taking out Patty Mills like Ezio LMFAO.
Thank you so much for your comment. I was wondering what sportsmastergeneral would think about my thoughts on Monty Williams thoughts of Patty Mills.
I’m so glad you commented. I was wondering what blumdiddlyumpkin would think if Monty commented on Patty Mills for years.
I’m so glad this post is here. I’ve been  wondering what Monty thought about Patty Mills for years now.
Monty is going to take out Patty Mills like Ezio
Patty Mills you legend
He has help. He’s playing next to harden. And joe Harris (who this sub was all about last season). And patty mills. And Aldridge. And Claxton (who this sub was all about last season). And James Johnson. Obviously Kyrie is an insanely massive loss though. Tens of millions out that could be filled by others. But the harden issues are a much larger detriment
Patty Mills can't win with these cats...
Patty Mills
"You didn't have a little heart palpitation when Patty Mills, the leader in 3 PT%, had two WIDE open 3's to make it a 4 point game with 2 minutes left?  Because if you didn't, I don't really believe you're an Arizona sports fan."
"Dude I watched the entire game... A game that's ""not as close as the score indicates"" mean there was never a chance for it to become tight. It was a 20 point game to start, then cut down to 9 with four minutes left.  Patty Mills missed a wide open 3 with 1:50 left that would've made it a 4 point game, that would've made this game interesting as fuck. Granted he missed, but at no point should a game that ""not as close as the score indicates"" ever get to that point no? It's not like the Suns starters were dribbling out the clock and letting the Nets just score lay ups the last 5 minutes, it was an actual game, and it's weird that Suns fans and now you are claiming it wasn't. They beat us wire to wire on a back to back, which is impressive on its own, but I guess some people want to embellish it more?"
The Nets would've fucking won if Patty Mills wasn't being a dumbass in the 4th quarter foh
What was Patty Mills doing? Why the fuck did Harden not try untill the 4th quarter?
If Patty Mills was wearing a Spurs jersey he isn’t missing a single shot
Bruh Patty Mills wtf was that
Patty Mills &gt; Steph Curry confirmed.
"Right, so it basically measures how well they’re filling their role IMO. You’re not gonna say Patty Mills is better than Steph Curry, but you are going to say that Patty Mills and Steph Curry are both absolutely thriving in their different roles respectively"
Guess I'm a casual then LOL. I always assumed Buddy was a 3 and D. Guess the big like Klay shoot like Steph got me. Thats on me lmao. Yeah not paying Caruso and forcing Wb was still not the move though if you had supermax space. I think Patty Mills probably would've been the better push. Who else was available this offseason? I guess maybe PJ?
Patty Mills
"How is our team worse ? It’s signficantly better than the team last year that Durant had in the semis. If we had lamarcus we win last year easily. Patty mills has been a huge improvement and bembry has also been a decent player. We will miss green but lamarcus and mills more than make up for him.   Combine that with the fact that harden was barely moving in that bucks series I don’t understand how you can say this team is worse. And nobody expected us to be an unstoppable force without kyrie, being 1 seed without him is still pretty good and where we should be"
I’ve seen Harden doing a lot of screening now  Usually results in a Patty Mills 3
Patty Mills is a star on FIBA only for me.
Someone said Kyle Lowry wasn’t a star is Patty Mills?
"tony parker, patty mills"
"I dont know, his point makes sense.  Why point out patty mills is native when it isn't contextually accurate, we're obviously talking about american natives, we all came from somewhere; we're talking about american natives now.  Someone else said the exact same thing with a different connotation above him and got upvoted.  Reddit is weird."
"Ok, but definitely chuck Patty Mills in there"
Patty Mills and the Spurs
"From the Lakers standpoint, yes, easily. And I am super low on Kyrie overall relative to consensus - I value him as like a Patty Mills type of player."
Patty Mills &gt; Kyrie sadly
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
"Three point shooting for us, guys like Buddy Hield or Patty Mills would be a good fit."
"Bruh Patty Mills would have been a horrible early pick, he was completely unimpactful in his early years in the league, which is the only time you have any guarantee of having him by drafting him"
"Patty Mills is a native, just not American native"
How you let Patty Mills down like that
1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. DeMar DeRozan 4. Blake Griffin 5. Jrue Holiday 6. Danny Green 7. Jeff Teague 8. Ricky Rubio 9. Patty mills

"Yeah, like that Patty Mills bloke."
patty mills &amp; kevin durant probably
Alex Caruso is half of Patty Mills plus 7.
"Patty Mills with most points and seventh-most shots haha, love to see it"
"Patty Mills is literally a fucking flame throwing Quoka, the little cute smiling assassin."
Patty mills is a fuckin shooter
Patty mills was a great signing by Sean marks
Udoka said they knew how to guard Patty Mills during the Olympics.
Patty Mills is fucking unreal.. he’s so clutch
PATTY MILLS
Patty Mills reminds me of Namek Goku
Patty Mills can shoot basketballs well
Patty Mills is now 61/121 (50.4%) from three in just 19 games this season. He's been absolutely incredible.
I like how Ime stayed with his comeback lineup with 6 mins left in the 4th. The starters were playing like their basketball skills got sucked by the monstars; Monstars being Patty Mills himself with his three bombs in the first quarter.
"patty ""joe harris"" mills!!!!"
Patty Mills is playing great. Has been since the Olympics
Patty Mills is cold!
Patty Mills and LMA have been the Nets best players today.
James Johnson is like 70% of Jeff Green while Patty Mills is 1000% of Mike James
"Celtics have missed 20 in-rhythm, open threes. Patty Mills has hit like 6 off-balance threes.  Game."
Patty Mills carrying the Nets as usual.
Refs are no excuse for what’s going on. We are getting wiped the floor with by Patty Mills again. Props to him for shooting lights out this year
Patty Mills is on fuckin fire
Patty Mills should have left spurs long ago
If you had to give the Nets two all-stars this year isn't it clearly Kevin Durant and Patty Mills
"I can see them getting Melo, not Tucker. There are other vets available in free agency. Patty Mills for example."
"That’d be nice. Overall, Dieng, Gay, Batum, Patty Mills are names I’d consider if I’m the Lakers"
"MLE is gonna be 5.9 million for them. Patty Mills certainly isn't gonna take the MLE, Otto Porter is not a shooter, Kyle Korver didn't even play this season so I think he's retiring. Redick will play for the Knicks or Nets to stay near his family.   Some of the other guys are good tho, and 1 will take it, but then its a free for all for the best vet minimums."
We still have prime MJ Patty Mills and the goat Jingles. We’re good.
"Ummm why didn't they just trade back???  The Knicks would have given them 19 and 21!!!!  And Primo is DEFINITELY there at 19  WTH the Spurs are fucked I don't think they win 30 games next season in West  They are losing DeRozan \[lead scorer\], super underrated Patty Mills AND Rudy Gay who has balls and hits shots.   Spurs are FUCKED"
"Yes yes front office  we have Lonnie Walker, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Patty Mills as our guards so lets take ANOTHER ONE"
"Melo, Dwight, DG, Patty Mills, Morris, Gay would be a great start."
worse than the process sixers  theres no way you think a team with patty mills joe ingles and matisse thybulle as there best players wins 40 games
Australia with Patty Mills will win dominate the league
"Reggie Bullock, Patty Mills, Wayne Ellington? Hell even Danny Green could be in contention if he really wants. We resign Caruso and Wes. Solid 3&amp;D players in that list"
"We're just talking shooting and nothing else? There's a busload of guys available on the market who are good shooters who probably wouldn't be super expensive.  Carmelo, Ellington, Lou Will, Ennis, Jeff Green, maybe Redick would be willing to make a near-min deal, maybe Korver, E'Twaun Moore, Patty Mills, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Kent Bazemore, Korkmaz, Otto Porter, Temple, Terence Davis, and on and on.  Obviously these are all role players and certainly not the elite of the elite, but they're all guys who can give shooting/spacing on cheap deals."
"Good shooting vets are available:Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, Wayne Ellington, Jeff Green, Doug McDermott, Patty Mills, etc. I’m not sure it would be hard to convince them to come to LA and play with 3 All-NBA players. Especially when 2 of them have averaged 10+ assists"
"I mean, I’m speaking in generalities, so I can’t explain the example you gave of Patty Mills. But, Australia is 85-90% one general demographic, so far more homogeneous than the US is.  My point is that there literally isn’t a country that is as diverse as the US is, at least at the scale that it is, and never has been, so there really aren’t any analogues you can draw in terms of national pride, patriotism, etc etc. The country is really an extremely varied collection of groups that operate and behave very independently."
Seth Curry gonna dominate as the #1 option like he’s Patty Mills 😤 😤 😤
"I don't know man, Australia has a lot of issues with structurally oppressed demographics and has a multicultural society spread over a massive area but Aussie players (outside of Ben Simmons) would bleed to play on the Boomers. Patty Mills mother was literally kidnapped by the government as part of the Stolen Generations, and he still bleeds green and gold. Think there's something else at play: could just be arrogance from the US (not undeserved), with other countries placing a higher value on a gold since it's a huge achievement for an international team but expected for the US."
"Lol Luka literally is literally the primary scorer, defender and playmaker for Slovenia. Patty Mills is the number 1 offensive option on Australia but he doesn't carry the defense or playmaking in the same way. No doubt Luka is superior, but the Aussies have depth"
But...we see him play in the NBA. We literally know he's not that good. There's a reason Patty Mills and Pau Gasol and Luis Scola ball out internationally. It's not the same level of competition whatsoever.
"My point is, the players are just considerably worse than NBA players. Shitty NBA players consistently dominate at the FIBA level because of it. They're smaller, weaker, slower and just overall less skilled. I mean if they weren't they'd be in the NBA.  If you put FIBA rules in the NBA, those same level players you're talking about would not get better at all. They would be the same. It's not rules that allow these guys to play better, it's the weaker competition.  The star players are like that because that's what wins basketball games. It's just in FIBA comps, the stars are Rui and Patty Mills. Just look at Slovenia since they only have one NBA player, Luka is playing literally no different from how he does in the NBA.  As for team USA, that's their own thing. As they have dominated Fiba Competition for years before this. They've been a shithouse org since 2016. Roster construction is awful and players don't seem to care about playing at all.  But you also have to admit, that if Team USA had a team of Lebron, Curry, Harden, AD, CP3, Kyrie, KD, Dame + some of the more ""role player"" types guys they have now, Draymond, Jrue, Khris. They'd stomp the competition. Team USA right now is not 08 and 12 Team USA."
So fiba Patty Mills?
Patty Mills did the same thing 2 years ago in 6 remote indigenous communities in Australia.
"It says more about the kind of skillset that enables success in FIBA ball vs the NBA imo. Patty Mills is a worse player than Jordan Clarkson in the NBA (feel free to debate this, just an example) but FIBA schemes reward players who can dissect and execute sets and read the floor vs the NBA, where the shooting is so good that a lot of ball handlers can feast off their ball handling and athleticism alone"
And Patty Mills and ballin out for Team Australia
"If the Spurs could get Ben Simmons for Derozan, Patty Mills (or Derrick White) and a first round pick. That would be great for the Spurs and better than the Brogdon offer the Sixers got from the Pacers.   If they want D White, they would have to throw in another player or two so just so the salaries match. If those salaries expire in the next 2 seasons, I don't think the Spurs would care"
YESSSSSS  And WE WANT PATTY MILLS TOO!!!!!!!!!  GIVE LAKERS ALL THE AUSSIES!!!!!!  AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE OY OY OY
Patty “Passion” Mills
I wouldn't mind some Patty Mills
no they rely on patty mills instead
If Patty Mills only get $4 million he must be going to Lakers
When USA players talk about preparing for the Olympic games they are really talking about preparing for the Patty Mills onslaught.
Australia Patty Mills vs France Evan Fournier who wins
GOAT player to reboot the Seattle SuperSonics franchise? Patty Mills!
There is no Olympic basketball. There is only Patty Mills.
Fournier is the French Patty Mills. They turn up at the Olympics!!
2nd round pick Nico!  The Italian Patty Mills.
Patty mills turns into prime Jordan with the national team
Micheal Jordan has a picture of Patty Mills on his bedroom wall
"Patty Mills too clutch, what a great match this has been!"
PATTY FUCKING MILLS
"Aus has very stagnant offence when Mills is out  Delly is a total black hole and ingles is kinda sluggish for some reason  Patty though, amazing stuff, changes everything. Truly no other player as good as international patty Mills"
"love patty mills attitude, grew up inspired playing bball because of him. works hard, awesome communicator - wish i took more notes haha"
"AARON ""PATTY MILLS"" BAYNES!"
"We don’t need Simmons, we have Boomer Patty Mills."
"Yeah all those teams scared me.  Patty mills is the 2nd best Fiba player after Doncic imo. The USA lack of size and weird offensive system could hurt them too. If they don’t have a big lead, they crumble"
"unless you encounter Patty ""MJ"" Mills"
International Mo Wagner is the second best player in the world behind international Patty Mills
"Patty Mills has played for Team Australia for, like, forever."
"Patty Mills is one of the few smaller point guards today who I don’t mind being the general of my bench unit. He has the touch to be anywhere on the floor, smartly cuts, and makes consistent winning plays for his team. He was one of the guys who I loved watching when I first got into basketball, and any team would be lucky to get him."

"as long as they keep THT we gucci.   Schroder, THT, AD and LeBron would have made the finals if AD didn't get hurt.   And that was after Schroder had covid and THT was still developing.   This season sky is the limit.   We do need to add Buddy Hield for Kuzma + Trez + 22nd pick.   And sign Patty Mills for the bench.  Schroder, Hield, KCP, LeBron, AD \[starters\]  Patty, Caruso, THT, Morris, Gasol \[bench\]"
patty mills
"I think Mills shooting puts him way over Teague. Don’t think he needs the ball in his hands all that much either he can come off screens sorta like Forbes. Lacks size but he’s a pesky, smart defender too. As for the big 3 handling the ball I agree that’s what we want the most but you can never have enough ball handlers and shooters, Patty is both. Think too, Donte has and will handle the ball in stretches as well. And those 3 aren’t gonna play 40 minutes a night in the regular season so there’s a good 18-20 minutes where it doesn’t hurt to have an extra ball handler. I also think Teague falls in the category of can’t switch and needs the ball in his hands group so not sure why you think he’s any better."
I thought y'all were being sarcastic but you guys genuinely believe patty fucking mills should have his number retired LMAOOO
*Patty Mills has entered the chat*
"Dude is like patty Mills, FIBA masters lol"
lol this dude really said the Lakers would be better with PATTY MILLS than Westbrook
"I don't think the problem is those guys not knowing their roles tbf, it's that guys like Lillard and KD are scared to be ball dominant. It feels like everyone's trying to be accomodating and that's stopping any actual organization or hierarchy from forming.   If Dame wants to take 20 shots, Tatum or LaVine isn't going to give a shit.   Like, you said Holiday fit well because he was used to his role from the Bucks, but Holiday ended up taking the most shots on the team vs France.   Team USA feels like a bunch of guys that are afraid to take ownership. Whether that's as a result of something Pop's telling them or because we're all just afraid of stepping on each other's toes, I have no idea, but that was pretty clearly the biggest issue, and what separates Team USA from these other international teams atm.  Australia knows Patty Mills and Joe Ingles are gonna take 15+ shots every game no matter what, France knows Fournier's gonna take 15+shots every game no matter what, Slovenia knows Luka's going to take 20+ shots every game no matter what.   Team USA goes into games and has no expectations for anyone and tries to play around whoever has the hot hand, and if no one's particularly hot, they literally have no consistency offensively."
Wtf Westbrook is a monster. Russel can take a bench and make them competitive. Him and AD would be insane.  Lebron could finally go to the bench up 5 and not come in down 12.   That year when Westbrook and Houston lost to the lakers he was coming back from an injury and covid - that’s just a next level athlete. If the lakers have the opportunity to sign him and get patty mills instead they’ll regret it.   Also he’s the closest to mamba mentality out there (Kobe said it himself) which I bet laker fans appreciate.
Oh man I'd love to have Patty Mills next year
This will be funny 6 months from now when Patty Mills is just an average back up pg... because that's what he is
"It's not a flashy name, but I'd love Patty Mills on my team."
No but he was memorable in that series along with Patty Mills and Danny Green. They all have iconic moments.
PATTY PATTY PATTY MILLS MILLS MILLS
Keep Lonzo and add another shooter. Patty Mills or Duncan Robinson would be good.
15 patty mills
15 patty mills
To hammer this point home he’s the perfect combination of a coked out Patty Mills in Australia competition and the sweet shooting of Joe Ingles. This would be great for Memphis and  if they can find a trade partner for Anderson
"People *do* say those things about every other coach. It's about time they say them about popavich. His performance with Team USA should forever damage his legacy. The spurs are one thing, but you mess up America's team, and you're on the bad list.  Seriously, how are guys like Patty Mills and Evan Fournier dominating but freaking Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard Can't?"
"&gt; I hope the NBA takes a long hard look at their shitty product if team USA gets further embarrassed in this Olympics.   Why?   In the fall, Luka and Gobert and Patty Mills and all the other guys who play well in the Olympics will be in the NBA.   It's not like if Slovenia wins the gold, then Luka will somehow go play in Slovenia. He's coming back to Dallas to sell tickets and jerseys and TV ad time for the NBA, no matter what happens in Tokyo."
"&gt; If on the world stage, over years and years, the NBA shows that it's becoming second fiddle to other leagues  How would the Olympics show that?   Luka is an NBA player. If he's the best player at the Olympics, it means the best player is an NBA player - same as if KD is the best player at the Olympics. If Patty Mills lights it up - well, the only place to see Patty Mills playing pro ball is in the NBA. It still reinforces that the NBA is the best league in the world.   The only thing that could challenge the NBA's supremacy is if a bunch of non-NBA players start beating NBA players. But I don't see the Adriatic League lighting up the Olympics.   A French NBA player outplaying an American NBA player doesn't hurt the NBA at all - just like a Florida NBA player outplaying an Oregon NBA player doesn't hurt the NBA."
"for the last 30 years, USA didn't need to shoot wildly uncontested 3 and hope for a good shooting night, the team dominated the entire game from start to finish, so, I think with big ""stars"" that are on the USA team, each one of them should when needed will themselves a bucket, and if they can't, then we gonna lose because none of them ""stars"" on the court wanna try an play ""team basketball"" anyway, Pop should just throw them the ball and say fuck it ya'll were gonna do what you wanted anyway, just go play pick up, and that isn't going to win Gold anymore, Patty Mills top 5 NBA players of all time at International competitions knows how to score and win in FIBA play"
"Rubio, Fournier, Patty Mills. Them dudes get HOF badge when playing for their countries"
"with FIBA rules for an olympic tournament? probably tbh, his style is a lot more suited to international rules than the nba, and he really knows how an olympic offense has to run  dame is the opposite, obviously thriving in the nba and there's a million miles between rubio in the nba and dame in the nba - i'd also rather have patty mills than dame for international play but that doesn't mean i think he's better than dame either lol"
"Ricky is like Patty Mills,when he puts on the national team shirt,he becomes a different kind of beast.   Looking like a whole snack out there as always."
Luka out there playing like he's Patty Mills
Luka out there channeling his inner Patty Mills
I raise you Olympic Patty Mills
&gt;se do not disrespect Olympic Patty Mills with this blasp  Remind me who was MVP last world cup?
Please do not disrespect Olympic Patty Mills with this blasphemy
What’s with the constant Patty Mills propaganda?
"Luka 48, Fournier 28, Mills 25, Campazzo 22, Gallinari had 18 on 9 shots... All NBA players.  While there are clear differences between NBA and FIBA basketball that make for a different experience, people need to accept that it's still putting a round orange object into the net at the end of the day... International NBA players don't seem to be having problems doing so regardless of who they play with. So the problem, first and foremost, is clearly with team USA and their approach, not actually lack of talent or the NBA game 'making this players lool better than they are', because players like Patty Mills make international basketball look like a joke, and he's not the only one..."
Low Key pasta that just compared FIBA Mills with Patty Mills
Do you think our Lord and Saviour Patty Mills will take this title once it's all said and done?
Counterpoint: Patty Mills IS FIBA
I want to see Luka head to head against FIBA Patty Mills.
"FIBA Luis Scola is the best player I've ever seen, up there with FIBA Patty Mills"
"C'mon man, Giannis will NEVER EVER be on FIBA Patty Mills level  NEVER"
But pop kept the goat patty mills from developing his full potential and fucked his grandmother
"A little bit. The guy had 3 or 4 hall of famers on his roster each pretty much every year he won the title. TD won Mvps under him, and Kawhi and TP both had near MVP level years during his tenure in San Antonio. He is no doubt one of the best  2 or 3 coaches ever, but I do think a lot of people overestimate his impact on winning.   Coaching is still important in the NBA, but for the most part, the team with the best roster wins, and he had a winning hand multiple times. If you look at their roster in the 2013-2015 range, it's absolutely ridiculous. They had 4 HOFers in TD, Parker, Manu, and Kawhi with prime Danny Green, Patty Mills, and Diaw to boot; any respectable coach could win with that roster.   Replace him with an average coach, and I still think TD wins multiple titles, but their success probably wouldn't have been as consistent without him."
Poor Patty Mills
Patty Mills is a WNBA legend
Crazy to think we could have put together one of the nastiest teams of all time but now we're losing to Evan Fournier and Patty Mills
"I kind of feel like USA players have had it drummed into them for years that mid-range jumpshots are the worst shots in basketball, that when it comes to International play with no defensive 3 seconds, they don't adjust to mid-range now being a very viable option.   Guys like Patty Mills and Evan Fournier take a lot of mid-range shots in International play because driving for lay-ups can be low percentage when you can have guys like Gobert waiting for you all game. They need a Chris Paul in the team who already loves the mid-range, to lead the way."
It’s a matter of a team bringing up the floor. It’s not like Patty Mills is running out there with guys who couldn’t sniff the floor at the Drew League; talent has improved across the globe.
&gt;we don't have nearly the best Americans on the squad.  No team in the Olympics have the best Americans on the squad...youre out here getting rekt by Evan Fournier and Patty Mills and your excuse is you don't have Lebron or Curry or AD. I cant help but laugh.
Patty Mills ain't walking through that door (for him)
Popovich is tanking the Olympics to get back at KD for the stolen ring from the Zaza incident and to get Patty Mills a gold.
"Calm down it’s not about that. I think it’s more like the team has no identity. France, similar to other programs with 3-6 good to great nba players have 1-2 go to guys on their team. Fournier can light it up similar to patty mills. They have an identity. Fournier scores, Rudy defends, Batum playmakes and defends. Team USA has a ton of scorers with most of them not used to playing off ball, and being 3rd options on the team. It’ll take time to gel and some superstars might have to focus on doing something else other than score."
Everyone is talking about how these other countries have simply caught up to our level like we're not getting roasted by Patty Mills and Evan Fournier in these games.
"Also when he plays against Lakers. Patty Mills, Gary Trent Jr and most recently Cameron Payne. These dudes gain buffs when they play us."
"Oh I want Schroder back too!!!!  Schroder resign. Kuzma for Buddy. THT Sign and Trade for Lowry.   Then Trezz for Patty Mills sign and trade.   Schroder, Lowry, Buddy, Mills + LeBron and AD"
Patty mills dancing to land down under.  That just cut through my unpatriotic Australian heart.
"Patty or “party” Mills, he be dominating on and off anyfloor"
"Eh, those might be impressive names but you have to apply context.  Gerald Wallace and Camby were *well* past their prime, Patty Mills barely played and was way *before* his prime, Andre Miller was past his prime, and Rudy Fernandez, Oberto, and Pryzbilla weren't even that good so I'm not sure why you're even listing them.  They were not one of the deepest teams of all time, dude.  Very few of those players were even close to their primes and some of their primes weren't even that good.  Like look at their contributions to that team, most of the dudes you listed weren't even good that year.  Like why list Oberto?  He literally only played 5 games for Portland and averaged less than 2 points and on his career was a 3.2 ppg player who only played 6 years.  Career high is 4.8 ppg.  You could list literally end of bench player and it would be equal to him  How i sthat evidence they were deep?"
"*boomers watching Patty Mills celebrate haha, well deserved boys!"
Damn. Say what you want about KD stacking superteams but it takes a big man to recruit Patty Mills to your team knowing that he’s gonna replace you as the alpha
As a PC fan who watched his career this is accurate.   Can be streaky shooter.   But Brooklyn I think is a good spot for him.  All their money is tied up in 4 guys (counting DJ)   they'll need some young cheap guys to play minutes to keep the big 3+  patty mills fresh
"you lost your best player in DeMar DeRozan, a great point guard in Patty Mills, and replaced them with Doug McDermott, who is ok but nothing special, a center who has played 8 games since the start of 2020 but is going to get paid 22 million dollars over three years, and Bryn Forbes, who is fine at best. you also had maybe one of the most whack lottery picks in recent history"
Patty Mills locks up Dame and drops 40 that's how
Second only behind Nets legend Patty Mills
"&gt;??? are you implying Patty isn’t a floor spacer? lmao  I hate how eager so many people are on this site to try to act smarter and more knowledgeable than others and to be patronizing at every opportunity.   Patty mills is a just above league average (league average is 35%, Patty shoots 37%-38%) 3pt shooter on 6 attempts per game.   Joe Harris is a 47% 3pt shooter on 6 attempts.   Patty is a decent scorer and arguably even better at spot up shooting, sure, but if it’s a team with KD, Gobert, and Doncic, I’d want a good ball handler/playmaker in that starting lineup and another who is an elite spot up shooter. I’d want Patty off the bench to provide energy and scoring for the backup unit.   That’s what I meant by “spacer,” not someone like Patty with an upper mediocre 3pt shot. Could’ve just asked what I meant instead of being so condescending."
"Harden was on that Thunder team. Portland had Aldridge, Gerald Wallace, Andre Miller, Batum, Camby, Patty Mills, Wes Matthews, Rudy Fernandez, Oberto, and Pryzbilla. I just looked it up. That might be one of the deepest teams I’ve ever seen."
Moody did be the nets w kd harden and patty mills
"If FIBA follows the NBA tradition of MVP having to be from the championship team, Durant is a no brainer. On a team consisting of some of the best NBA players in the world, dude was still a level above everyone else.  But if this can be awarded to the best player of the tournament, period... then it should without a doubt be Patty Mills (27/7/5) or Luka Doncic (23/10/10). Both were clearly more valuable to Australia/Slovenia than KD was to USA."
This is a good reminder that pretty much every player in the NBA can dunk.  Watching Patty Mills throw down two hand dunks in the layup line is something else.
"I think the olympic lineup is slightly better with Gobert and FIBA Patty Mills, but the Nets are darn close to it."
"&gt;Thinking Patty Mills can drop 30ppg is the nba is the dumbest take. End of story.  Repeating my previous suggestion.  You need to learn how to read -- and critically, before calling anyone else ""dumb""."
He wasn’t better than Patty Mills this olympics…not even close.
"Yup. It's a massive skew that makes our women's teams look much better, but the rest of the world doesn't have female Patty Mills or female Messis."
I mean there is little different between this starting line up and the current Nets outside of Gobert.  James Harden is still a better Luka despite what a lot of Luka stans think atm.  Kyrie is a muuuch better Rubio.  Patty Mills is on the Nets.  Just missing Gobert.
But also Patty Mills joined the Nets so who's really the winner here

Patty Mills Olympic Aussie Bonus add + 99 to stats.
Australia Patty Mills and Spain Ricky Rubio are the 2 greatest players of all time
Thinking Patty Mills can drop 30ppg is the nba is the dumbest take. End of story.
Does Patty Mills *know* he has a girl’s name? The masculine version is Paddy. This has always bothered me
Obviously it's going to go to the winning team and I'm obviously biased but nothing can convince me that Patty Mills wasn't the MVP
I met Gerald Wallace at a t-shirt signing that Patty Mills put on for Assist Australia and he was a super nice dude. One of my favorite Blazers at the time.
Gobert as the big man.  KD and Jokic as the forwards.  Patty Mills and Jrue Holiday as the guards.
"people just look at the 4-0 and think the Spurs had no chance. the only game we truly got smoked was Game 2 because the entire team looked shook af without two of our leading starters. and even while missing players, Games 3 and 4 were still pretty competitive (contrary to what the final score might show you)  - we were missing our starting PG in Tony Parker, who was having a great playoffs until his injury, resulting us in having to start Patty Mills against Stephen Curry  - we would've won the first game 100% if Kawhi didn't get injured, giving the team huge momentum against a superteam  - Danny Green was playing without his WING STOP running mate, resulting in a massive hole in our defence  - Pau Gasol was running on fumes and getting run off the court because he was essentially our only big who was decent and gave a shit since...  - ...LaMarcus completely gave up (this was before he requested a trade and worked things out with Pop) because he was being forced to play as a center and getting double-teamed on every possession  - Jonathan Simmons looked checked out of trying to win at this point and seemed like he was just playing for his contract year  - we lost David Lee (who had become a key rotation player) after he was injured in Game 3  - our best player was 39 year old Manu Ginobili for fucks sake lol"
Funny enough Patty Mills was on the Blazers roster in this video
Is Patty Mills the GOAT?
"I didn't ever in any way say I thought he WOULDN'T be a 25 ppg scorer.  And if he was that, it would be less than what he is now, which was EXACTLY MY POINT.  Like, I seriously do not undertand why you are even arguing this.  I said he'd be great.  all nba for sure, and likely 1st team.  I said he'd still be a great scorer.  The only thing is that he wouldn't be as efficient because the rules at teh time allowed players to be more physical on defense and did NOT allow offensive players to bait into cheap free throws the way they do now.  All of which are objective facts.  Then you start throwing in MUggsy - totally irrelevant.  Then you bring up FIBA results which are ALSO totally irrelevant unless you REALLY think Patty MIlls should regularly be putting up 30 in the NBA.  Everything you have said actually agrees with me, or at the least does not refute me in any way shape or form - and yet you still seem to be insisting that we disagree somehow.  Peace out, fellow bball fan.  May your teams never have nasty injury luck, and always have a competent FO."
Why even have a Hall of Fame if you’re going to let Patty fucking Mills in?
"Patty Mills numbers, wow."
Fluka Donchoke gets put in his place by patty mills
[Patty Mills post-game interview for those interested](https://streamable.com/gsoubr)
" I think the transition will be somewhat smoother than some suggest.  Gid was a starter for the Adelaide 36ers in the NBL, then played for Australia's team Boomers with teammates Joe Ingles, Aaron Baynes and Patty Mills, exposing him to high levels of international basketball before even stepping foot on an NBA court. That's arguably better for acclimating players into the NBA than the NCAA - filled with one and done prospects."
Lucky they secured Patty to carry his old ass this year. Scoring title is Mills' to lose.
"For a NBA player, Patty Mills isn't self-centered. That's awesome."
Patty Mills? Isn’t that what team Australia is?
"because udoka is clearly visible in the video, and kd's voice gets louder to make the statement just after he raises his eyes to look past the camera and patty mills. the title doesn't have to have every single bit of context in it, because that's how you end up with those massive title gore headlines"
Patty Mills is a great pick-up for the Nets. He adds much needed depth on the bench.
Patty mills is a legend and finally brought us a medal respect he is a real  one on and off the court
and Patty Mills!
For a moment I was confused about why Patty Mills was associated with Boomers. I was like...dude aint even old. But then I remembered this was basketball
"With all of the context this rivals the “Y’all look so different” meme potential too.  *“Get outta here man, that’s my teammate!” Patty Mills says as he shoves Udoka before embracing Kevin Durant, patting him on the chest. “Fuck outta here!” Jayson Tatum yells. “We know how to lock Patty’s ass up,” Udoka confidently states. They all laugh it off and resume the celebration.*"
Very happy for patty mills to join the nets! We have a killer team next year.

"As a Slovenian these last two games were rough, but damn me if I don't respect the shit out of Patty Mills right now. Dude was amazing and you guys cooked us. Congrats, you cunts. Well deserved."
FIBA Patty Mills &gt;
Congrats Australia!  Also I have to say. You know how I knew when Patty Mills was the fucking truth?  NBA 2K11. Loved using the Blazers in that game. He was like deep down on the depth chart and I was playing my friend one game and someone got hurt mid game and I had to bring him in. Hit 6 straight fucking 3s with the guy and and went like 9/9 in under 5 mins and came back to win. I still talk shit to my friend about that game to this day.  I was like this guy is a fucking legend and started using him immediately in games after.
The basketball god Olympian Patty Mills
I have very fond memories of blazer legend patty mills thank you. Even though he didnt get the most playing time during that era
The biggest oversight with Patty Mills is that he's unbelievably sexy. I can't go on a hour of my day without thinking about plowing that tight Australian ass. I'd kill a man in cold blood just to spend a minute with his crotch grinding against my throbbing manhood as he whispers g'day mate to me in his aboriginal accent.
"I know what Luc Longley means to Australia, so where does Patty Mills now stand?"
"I dunno, it might be easier to believe that Carmelo Anthony dropped 20 pounds in a summer because he wanted to be better able to chase Patty Mills around in their 2 games the coming season, having always taken his defensive responsibilities very seriously. I haven’t tried."
"I've been teary eyed all morning, Patty Mills means so much to my kids and I as Spurs fan,  and for him to get his medal...hoy sholit I'm tearing up writing this...fuck yea, Australia!"
Patty Mills dropping 40 bombs in the big game. He deserves the hardware.
"Australians, I have a question for you:  Patty Mills or Emma Mckeon?"
Luka didn’t even medal?!  Instead patty freaking mills did.....
"Listening to Patty speak makes me hate Ben Simmons even more. It’s unbelievable how mentally weak, selfish and spoiled he truly is. His countrymen are putting everything on the line for this. Dude can’t take a layup or even show up because of his fragile ego. Good for Australia and Patty Mills. Well deserved."

If I could chose to be one man on this Earth it would be Mr Patty Mills

Thank you for this post. Patty mills is my favourite Australian and he represents our country with so much passion and class. He deserves this medal so so much and he makes me proud to be Australian
"They didn't re-do all of them, just a lot of popular ones i don't think every player got measured again  Mills is listed at 6'1"", he is not 6'1"" barefoot that's Westbrook without shoes who towers over Patty"
PATTY FUCKEN MILLS
Patty Mills was in Vancouver to renew his visa a few years back.  He bought a pair of shoes from a local shop I worked at.  I imagine he’s got a few free pairs at home so pretty cool he supported a local business like that.
Patty Mills cures Cancar.
Blazers legend Patty Mills!!! Congrats my dude
"Blazers legend, Patty Mills"
"Well the Thunder just went 22-50 with SGA as their #1 who I'm sure we'd agree is a better player, I don't even think a Patty Mills-led team does better than that."
Patty Mills &gt; MJ I am happy to get in a physical altercation with anyone who disagrees
This is just idiotic to say. There’s literally no situation where your team is competitive with Patty Mills as your No.1 option
Patty Mills fkn Boomers did it
Aight what about the Mavs theyre almost all international players. Also you said a team with Patty Mills or Ben Simmons bring the best player cause they're international I'm just using your own dumbass argument against you.
"PATTY MILLS LETS GO, PERFORMANCE WAS AWESOME"
"agreed; well said.   Patty Mills a great example of a modern leader who might be able to change the course a little bit, tap into a deeper shared culture."
Patty Mills will 100% not be starting for the Brooklyn Nets
wish patty mills was a laker
"Patty fucking Mills man. What a legend. He's never going to have to pay for a beer in Australia again, not just for what he's done for the Boomers, but for all the top work he's done in the indigenous community."
Patty mills better then doncic confirmed
"I need to stand next to Kevin Durant just to experience it, because Patty Mills is still a few inches taller than me too lolol and he looks like a child next to Kevin lolol"
Patty Mills is an upgrade over Spencer Dinwiddie and no one can tell me otherwise
My favorite interaction I’ve ever had with an NBA player was watching a playoff game in a coffee shop with Patty Mills and Boris Diaw. Super cool dudes.
So was Patty Mills though
Don't forget Patty Mills.
"  &gt; Batum, Patty Mills and a couple others took the minimum or mid- level to go play in NYC and LA.   Batum cited Klay's injury for the reason to sign with the Clippers last season and then stuck around.   It had nothing to do with Steph.  Patty wants to ring chase, once again Klay's injury is the reason for the Warriors being unable to close these deals."
"No one else was offering Dlo the max. Batum, Patty Mills and a couple others took the minimum or mid- level to go play in NYC and LA.   KD hopped on because he didn’t want to end up like Charles Barkley with no rings and a 73 win team had cap space to sign him."
"Lakers/Nets are not the sure thing everyone thinks.   Nets' depth is ridiculous. They are choosing between Claxton and old man Griffin as a STARTING 5. Their 2nd unit will be Mills, Cam Thomas, Cabarrot, James Fucking Johnson and Claxton. Yada yada super team, yada yada who guards people, this goes to shit when you have basically no depth behind them. Only Mills and Claxton/Griffin are good enough to roll single digit minutes in the playoffs and KD won't endure playing 48mpg for a whole season. Add how injury prone Kyrie is and done, the Nets are built to crumble with this 6-man rotation in the post-season. The Lakers at least tried to shore up their bench. Rondo, Nunn, Monk, Melo, Howard can hold their own enough to allow their own big 3 to rest.   I would bet on the Bucks before the Nets. Maybe even on the Hawks/Sixers. The Nets lack of anything that resembles NBA talent off their Big 3, Patty and Non-Clutch Harris is ridiculous."
Patty mills is on brooklyn
He's Brooklyn Nets guard Patty Mills now :(
"Aliir Aliir is Thon Maker's cousin, Patty Mills' cousin is professional Rugby League player Edrick Lee"
Patty Mills and DeMar DeRozan 🖤
"You’re missing the point. This man could have obviously flourished if he was a second or third scoring option on any team, and he could hit clutch buckets as well as anybody in the league at the time. He was a primetime player that had his knees cut out from under him because of my main point: being Asian.   When another guard like Patty Mills or CJ McCollum get hot, they are given the green light to take over when the first options aren’t scoring. When Lin got hot, he was criticized for stepping up beyond the fad of “who is this Asian American player knocking down big time shots and scoring for four straight possessions in a stagnant offense?”   At the very least he should have received the respect that he could knock down tough shots when the offense wasn’t clicking. Instead he was relegated to garbage time where he made the most of his opportunities and was criticized as someone who couldn’t accept a traditional defend/pass-first/spot up 3 point guard role despite his (proven) ability to penetrate as well as anybody in the league at the time as well as knock down jumpers."
Patty Mills’ cousin is a professional footballer and his uncle is an incredibly influential activist for indigenous Australian’s rights.
Patty Mills!
Amazing! No wonder Patty Mills in the green and gold is so damn good
"On 3 June, Australians commemorate Mabo Day, marking the anniversary of the historic Mabo decision.  Eddie Mabo grew up in the Torres Strait. Inhabitants of the strait’s islands, which are considered Australian territory, endured segregation, government control over their movements, and wages paid in credit rather than cash for food and housing.  After Mabo learned that Australian law didn’t recognize his right to inherit land that had been passed down through generations of his family, he became the lead plaintiff in a legal challenge to the doctrine of Terra nullius, which held that Australia had been unoccupied before white Europeans began to settle the continent in 1788.  The case took a decade, but on June 3, 1992, five months after Mabo died, the High Court of Australia ruled in Mabo’s favor, enacting the concept of “native title” in Australian law. One justice wrote the pre-existing legal regime “made the indigenous inhabitants intruders in their own homes.”  Eddie Mabo was San Antonio Spurs guard Patty Mills’ great-uncle."
"Lol this is especially stupid if this is a Pop quote. The foreign born player's he's showing preference to are almost all people of color. Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobli, Tony Parker, Boris Diaw, Patty Mills etc. His assessment would seem to be more critical of the AAU system than anything."
Seems more like a Patty Mills to me but tomato-tomahto
"Now imagine if he’d’ve gone to the Olympics to play with Patty Mills and Jingles, helped Australia into a medal, perhaps even a different colour to the one they won. Not to mention being in and around a brilliant group of guys who all would’ve been incredibly supportive and welcoming after how the Philly season ended.   People would’ve forgotten a little of how the season ended and his Olympic heroics would’ve been front of mind in the conversations regarding trades.   Instead he’s in London rooting Maya Jama (great work bruz) and then hanging out in LA doing Instagram workouts."
Patty mills
Isn't that patty mills
"*Remembers Nash knocking Patty Mills out during his last playoff run in Phoenix.   The Suns won that series in 2010. Could've been referencing that spurs/lakers series when Nash was a laker. That would've been nash's last playoff run, though I'm not even sure he played in the playoffs."
I like the wizard of oz tho. But he doesn’t deserve it. That should be a Patty Mills nickname.

"The Weeknd, Gary Trent Jr, Patty Mills"
So confirmed first option for Brooklyn is patty Mills like on Olympic team
"On the same vein, Splash Bandicoot (Patty Mills)"

Patty Mills is the goat

"The conversation:  Kevin Durant ""want a ring?:  Patty Mills "" ye.."""
“I’m not here to fuck spiders.” - Patty Mills
"Then show me a single clip of any of these 30 players doing this move.  Curry, Harden, Kyrie, Lebron, Lillard, Randle, Trae, Fox, Sexton,Ingram, Westbrook, Beal, CP3, Ja Morant, Lowry, Middleton, Rubio,Simmons, Kawhi, Lavine, Campazzo, Conley, Lonzo, Lamelo, Carmelo, McCollum, Blake Griffin, Tony Parker, Patty Mills or Rajon Rondo.  If everyone is doing it all the time then finding a single clip shouldn't be hard."
"&gt; They've added Patty mills, while the Bucks have lost PJ Tucker, an important defensive piece during that series.  Nets also lost Jeff Green, whereas the Bucks will be adding Dante back. Not saying the Bucks would win or anything, but just trying to add more context to this upcoming season."
"You already dip with fundamentals by bending your legs into your shot. Dipping the ball low and dipping your head exposes the ball and reduces your court vision. Players are squaring up around screens...they just get into the motion through the movement. Klay T, Patty Mills, Steve Nash...all fundamental and deadly behind a screen."
"it doesn't really have anything to do with disrespect since the Nets were a size of Durant's foot away from eliminating the bucks in a game 7, with Irving out and Harden on one leg.    They've added Patty mills, while the Bucks have lost PJ Tucker, an important defensive piece during that series.  KD still managed to score 50 in those conditions, IF the whole team is healthy I don't see how that would go to  game 7."
"So when he averaged 40+ points for 5 months of the 2019 season you watched it with a straight face?   Like you literally sat there, as he dropped insane numbers every game by himself off pure isolation, with a straight face and said “god this is so boring, I’d rather watch demar iso and pass it to patty mills off a back screen”?"
I don't think the rest of the team is deep enough and/or plays strong enough defense. I guess maybe the addition of Patty Mills could make them deep enough but that remains to be seen.    Giannis/Middleton/Jrue vs Durant/Kyrie/Patty is pretty close the bench play will matter a lot  Obviously putting healthy Harden in the mix makes the Nets a HEAVY favorite. If you have 2 evenly matched teams and then add an ALL Nba player to one side that team becomes monster faves
Patty Mills has never fouled out in his 739 games played. This upcoming season will be his 13th.
"Consequence of no defense, but also patty mills"
"Yeah I'd take a shooter before I'd get a defender like Simmons. I was thinking Wiggins, or maybe Patty Mills. As someone said, SGA could also work."
Surprised Cam Thomas isn’t here. Nets had trouble keeping their stars healthy and Thomas already looks ready to step up with Patty Mills.
"No that's exactly the point I'm making: given their tax implications it doesn't make sense to spend unless they can find one of those tipping-point players. They had a list early in guys like Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, or Nic Batum. All chose to sign elsewhere."
"Andrew Gaze and Laurie Jackson. They are the top 2 GOAT basketball players on-court and off-court, it's hard to pass them. Patty Mills is 3rd GOAT basketball player as well."
"He might be waiting 2-3 months to see if anyone gets injured on a contender. If Joe Harris or Patty Mills have any injury issues, Brooklyn may be willing to sign JJ just for some depth at that point"
"KD got hurt in 2019 and the Rockets became heavy favourites as soon it happened. Kawhi got hurt in 2017 but Harden dropped 10 points, 6 turnovers, fouled out and lost by 30 to Patty Mills and Johnthan Simmons in an elimination game."
"Who are the 2 starters under 30? Joe Harris turns 30 September something and Kyrie will be 30 in March, and he’s already injury prone so counting him as one of the young guys doesn’t bode well. KD, Harden, Blake, DJ and Patty Mills are all over 30. I guess maybe you’re thinking they start Claxton?"
Olympic Patty Mills
Can’t forget my boy [patty mills](https://imgur.com/gallery/NqQB01f)
Andrew gaze and patty mills once he retires would be our two. Luc was lucky enough to be on a great bulls team rather than a great player individually I think.
That's basically what Patty Mills is to the Clippers
"top 11? The disrespect to Patty Mills, I tell you."
"Nets got better too. Patty Mills, LMA, and Millsap. Potentially Cam Thomas as well"
"Don’t need em, it’s Patty Mills time baby"
"Kyrie isn't a bad defender like his rep will have you believe. Last year, he was excellent in creating deflections and getting steals. A much better defender than the alternative which would be Patty Mills starting with Harden.   Simply put, without him the Nets are still title contenders, but def not the clear cut favs. Bucks and Heat could realistically beat them before the finals and obviously the Lakers in the finals."
"Patty Mills, of course"
Hope Durant and patty mills can get this as well
"That's a tricky but interesting question.  An Aussie can correct me if I'm wrong but I think in Australia they might say 'black' to describe someone like Patty Mills.  But ultimately race is an artificial construct.  The thresholds for how we categorize people racially are really malleable and inconsistent.   A black American might say an indigeneous Australian is not 'black' per se, since they don't originate from Africa.  But most Black Americans have some European or Native American ancestry at some point, so who's to say really?  A half black person is just considered 'black' in America whereas in South Africa that person would be  called 'colored'."
"[Patty Mills mentions The Stolen Generation in this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations#:~:text=The%20Stolen%20Generations%20(also%20known,acts%20of%20their%20respective%20parliaments.)  edit: ^^ this is a link to the wikipedia about that"
Harden  Ingles  Mikal  Crowder  Capela  ——Bench:  Bobby Portis   Patty Mills
Patty Mills is such a class act and the NBA is so lucky to have him in it
"This team is way more proven than that Clippers team.  KD, Patty Mills, and Kyrie have been there and shown up.  Harden, Millsap, LMA, Blake, and James Johnson all know how to play in the playoffs.  Even the young guys like Bruce Brown, Claxton, and Harris have experience in the playoffs."
"Can just picture a lineup with Patty Mills, Harden, Simmons, KD, and LMA being incredible. That would be better floor spacing than Ben has ever had."
If Patty Mills becomes the starting point guard for Brooklyn Nets out of this I'm gonna be so stoked and hyped
"I called it when they signed KD and Kyrie that they'd never win with those 2, mainly because of Kyrie. Signing Harden gave them a giant boost, as did signing all those veterans for small/min deals.   It's insane that they have Aldridge, Blake, Millsap, Patty Mills besides their big 3, plus a few other nice pieces in Joe Harris, Bruce Brown Jr, James Johnson (if he can still play ?)."
&gt;patty mills  &gt;tall  hmmmm
thats why the patty mills fit is so good. That was a brilliant signing for them
"They win a championship with Lowry/Jrue/any top 10 PG. Been saying this. Morey gets way too much credit as a GM, he has made a ton of huge mistakes less than a year into his tenure. Not trading Simmons, not trading for Lowry, not acquiring a PG in the off-season... these were all very doable moves.    For example, this 76ers team would have been PERFECT with Patty Mills at PG. Why was there no attempt to acquire him? Maybe he still picks the Nets even if you offer more money, but you gotta at least try...."
"Ehh, they got Patty Mills now."
Fuck that guy. Cheer for Patty Mills and some other guys he plays with in Brooklyn.
"Harden/Joe Harris/KD/Blake/LMA  Bench : Patty Mills/Cam Thomas/Bruce Brown/Millsap/Claxton  With James Johnson/Jevon Carter/ Bembry/ Day'Ron Sharpe as end of bench  This team can win a ring 100%, not like they're favorite and are gonna smash teams left and right but on a good run they can"
I guess I really missed the joke because I thought it was about Patty Mills. Completely forgot about Hennifer S.
&gt;DeMar DeRozan? Gone. LaMarcus Aldridge? Gone. Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are gone   but Joshua Primo has arrived
"&gt;You aren't even reading what I'm writing at all lol  Barely, I would still pick Green over Milsap and Mills but Patty may help them, in any case."
Patty Mills is playing until 50 so idk what you’re talking about
Maybe he meant the Raptors retiring his jersey. Not the Spurs. IMO next person the Spurs retire is Patty Mills.
"not sure about the nets, patty mills, re-signing KD, Bruce and Blake, and drafting Cam all seem more impactful"
I’d say patty mills is a much bigger deal than LMA tbh. Now they’ll have an elite movement shooter on the floor at all times while they’re elite shooting ball handlers have the ball lol. He’ll be better than shamet was.   Patty Mills is still really good. I was so sad that they got him lol  For the Magic it was definitely getting Suggs at 5. Most people thought he’d go 4.  Wolves was firing Rosas
Almost as good as the 2 best aus players   Matisse thybulle and patty mills  Still our little brother NZ
Or Patty Mills
You forgot one.   Patty Mills.
I guess Patty Mills is better than Dame too then
"I didn’t think Patty Mills kept to himself, he was a leader on the Spurs and Boomers."
Isn’t Patty Mills also known to be a glue guy outside of the game as well? Remember he did some coffee and flannel thing when he was at the Spurs
Patty mills has never struck me as the quiet type tbh
"&gt;“We’ve got a fairly quiet group. Most of the guys are to themselves; they stay in their own little shells. It’ll be nice to get them out, open up a little bit, even myself. &gt;  &gt; “I’m not that loud, but … I’m more loud than anybody on this team, like Paul [Millsap], LaMarcus [Aldridge], Patty [Mills], [Kevin Durant], you’ve got a lot of guys who are just to themselves. So it’s my job to open them up a little bit”.   Exactly how I imaged the Nets"
"Harden, Cam Thomas, Patty Mills, Nic Claxton, LMA."
Olympic Bronze Medallist Patty Mills
"Wait and see what happens bro. Maybe one more year of improvement if he take care physically. He's got a lot of miles on him. You could see it at the Olympics when he wasn't protected, Patty Mills sorted him out."
"gerald green, steve novak, and patty mills are all GOATs for kids playing 2k in the early to mid 2010s that didnt want to spend money on myteam"
So i missed the news that patty mills signed with the nets i guessed.  they are stacked.
"Ben Simmons is a bitch. So sick of seeing him. As an Aussie, we claim Patty Mills over Simmons any day."
Tbf even Jordan couldn't hold a candle against Patty Mills playing for Australia.
Ben Simmons isn't even the best Australian player  Team Australian Patty Mills is literally unbeatable
"Great point about Blake and LMA damn. No team can run with 100% healthy Kyrie/Harden/KD/Blake/LMA with Joe Harris sixth man, plus Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, Paul Millsap off the bench. Cam Thomas looks good too"
Patty Mills has hit those shots before at least
"Patty Mills is a worthy representative, yall are covered."
"Patty Mills got released by the Blazers. It was a lockout period, so nobody could sign him and he played for Melbourne during that stretch. Then signed as a free agent with the Spurs."
Sort of same thing for patty mills.
Patty mills came into my coffee shop today and I had no idea it was him. Took his order and everything. Apparently the nets are practicing here in San Diego for now. He got a triple shot flat white.
"I mean Kyrie is obviously better, but in the scenario where he'd a massive distraction I don't think that's the worse trade for both sides. KD + Harden is an overwhelming amount of offense regardless, I don't think surrounding them with Joe Harris, Patty Mills, and a defensive player of the year candidate is the worst thing to do."
"Honestly, as a Aussie, I’m kinda glad he gave the Olympics a miss. By all accounts, the Boomers set up is a positive, team orientated, fun environment and I’m just not sure he would have helped our campaign. In the words of Patty Mills “(rose) gold vibes only”."
"Patty Mills because I went to school with him. Players on the team knew he was going to be good and told anyone that would listen. Also as a side note, Steph Curry's last college game was against vs Saint Marys and it was a barn burner."
"whilst I sadly wouldn't disagree with this, look at the love patty mills has been (so rightfully) getting - that could have all been simmons' if he wanted to show up and go hard for the boomers."
"yeah fo sho, i don't get why people think otherwise. I mean my hot take is that Patty Mills will eventually get in through his contributions to Australian basketball and a lengthy NBA career"
"Would have covered the Nets use of the tax payers MLE this offseason.  Free Patty Mills!  \[Edit\] Opps.  No.  Luxury tax hit was 29M, salary was 6M.  Joe Tsai will have to cover the other 5M."
It's hard not to like Patty Mills.
 Patty Mills will not be giving 100% this season in Brooklyn as he finds himself with a lesser role than he’s had in quite some time - ESPN
Patty Mills a real one tho.
"The point is that argument wasn't made after summer league and preseason, it was made after Carsen had half a season of NBA run under his belt, and legitimately looked awful. Not to mention even if upside Carsen worked out he'd at best be a Patty Mills type player. Not exactly a foundational piece that deserves the term mortgaging the future for if you had to give him up."
The team with Patty Mills
Wym you had patty mills hes better than Simmons would’ve ever been in the olympics
"OJ Mayo, Ricky Rubio, Brandon Jennings.  I'm going to add Patty Mills as well. I watched him ages ago in the Olympics just ball out on the top USA talent."
"Assuming Blake and Aldridge are garbage of course, and then there's Patty Mills and Millsap lol"
Precious Achiuwa-&gt;Gerald Wallace/Mo Harkless  Malachi Flynn-&gt;Patty Mills  Our bench is better than our starting lineup!
"Lmao the Raptors prob have the worst team.  PG: Tony Parker, Patty Mills  SG: Buddy Hield,   SF: Gerale Wallace, Luc Mbah a Moute  PF: Draymond Green  C: Kevon Looney, Jerome Williams"
"I think he won’t play much but he’s a nice option to have, probably somewhere between 16-18mins if that. I think we will get THT playing up a few positions (up to SF) and Nunn as backup PG/SG most of the time.    I certainly see that rotation as more than capable of dealing with Patty Mills and Jevon Carter for the Nets, Payne for the Suns, Divicienzo for the Bucks, etc."
"Patty Mills because he's a legend. Nets obviously have a few jerks on their team, not to mention any names."
Patty Mills
"Patty Mills. I hate super teams, but I can't hate Patty"
Nets looked rusty and lacked a coherent game plan. Patty Mills looks like the truth though.
I think we underestimate how dangerous Patty Mills can be next to Harden and KD.  I wouldn't be surprised if ends up shooting 50% from 3 for the season.
You think Irving wouldve scored ~44 pts? Because thats what he would need to drop for the Nets to win if you change him with Patty Mills
Patty Mills
Patty Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge only players on Brooklyn on the top of the plus/minus scale lol. Go spurs go?
"As a Spurs fan, I'm just happy to see Patty Mills doing well."
"Some of these are focused on aspects of each team that has been causes for concern since last season.   Milwaukee: Giannis FT shooting was a hot topic last playoffs. To see him look much more comfortable at the line today is a good sign.   Brooklyn: The loss of Kyrie meant others had to step up, so to have only Patty Mills make a field goal for the bench is concerning for the Nets.   LA: AD’s FT shooting has been subpar since preseason. Many thought he’d pick up the slack once the season started but tonight was his worst night from the line yet. Also Westbrook’s play has been a concern since preseason as well and it still carried over.   GSW: Last year’s squad would be dead in the water if Steph shot like he did today. The fact that they were able to pull off this win against a much more talented team (with missing pieces too) is a great sign for them moving forward.   Like you said, it’s only game 1. But seeing how these teams/players have (not) adjusted to fix their weaknesses or slumps can be a guage for how the team will fare moving forward."
KD and Harden need to understand they can't sit back and relax their way to a championship just because they brought Patty Mills in
He is so useless with Bron out there. Imagine a Patty Mills or someone that would actually serve a role on that roster instead of Russ.
Patty Mills would even be a better fit
Patty Mills…  This was beknowst in San Antonio
#the patty mills show 7/7 from the arc and 21 points for the night! Hell yeah!
Just think if Kyrie wasn't stupid and was there with Patty Mills...they would be legit scary...yet he's chilling making $17M not there for his team.
After tonight I am more scared of Patty Mills tbh
"Patty Mills looks like a steal for the Nets now. Nets were +7 with him on the floor, -30 when he was off, which was only about 18 minutes."
"Patty mills shooting the lights out, 7 out of 7. The only positive"
Patty Mills looked to be in olympics form
"Milwaukee looked good. Championship confidence may be a real thing. Go patty mills, though not gonna shoot 100"
They had Patty Mills go 7/7 from three and lost.   Gg nets are frauds.
LeBron looking like Patty Mills out there
I love Patty Mills take care Patty
"Greyson Allen was a great acquisition too, along woth Patty Mills."
Patty Mills 7-7 from 3
patty mills 2021 all star?
He was just watching Patty Mills V Bucks
Do you like patty mills 3s because that’s about it for Nets highlights
Patty Mills can't win with these cats.
"is no one talking about Patty Mills becoming a laser, going 7-7 from deep?????"
Patty Mills took most of his minutes and shots and went 7-7 from deep
stipulating FIBA Patty Mills in the contract better than having Do Your Own Research Kyrie!
Cam Thomas who played four minutes matched the scoring from the entire Nets bench minus Patty Mills… wow
Especially in terms of off ball movement  Aside from Patty Mills and surprisingly at times KD the Nets had zero off ball movement at all
Get Patty Mills some help
Hope Kyrie gets vaccinated and Patty Mills gets benched for good
No overreacting here man. Nets just need to blow it up and build around Patty Mills
I have concluded that Patty Mills is the greatest 3 point shooter of all time
"Texbook blowout.  Nets didn't look good.  Bucks looked like true contenders with a team that plays together, even after Jrue left with a heel contusion.  The Nets offense was simply ""give ball to Durant/Harden, hope it works.""   Their stars had low energy and settled for contested jumpers throughout.  Patty Mills is the only reason they didn't lose by thirty."
"I felt like he had a great game just watching him, especially after a rough first start. Feels worse because everybody else except Patty Mills sucked so he was playing from behind the whole game and couldn’t keep up by himself."
If Morey’s smart he’ll trade Ben for Patty Mills immediately
Jordan Nwora and Patty Mills played like they just got off the plane from the Oympics.
"Giannis will get all the praise but Connaughton and Nwora were the unsung heroes of this game for MIL.  Also shout out to Patty Mills, dude played his ass off."
Patty Mills just can't win with these cats
Patty Mills can't win with these cats
"Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, and Joe Harris are great role players."
Only cuz of Patty Mills he’s like +10 100% from 3 lol
"This Nets team is not looking good for their debut.  Durant and Harden settling way too much on contested jumpers, and otherworldy shooting by Patty Mills to make sure they're not down by 30."
Nets were 1 Patty Mills away from losing by 30-35
"Patty Mills drops 20, and you down the entire game? That’s wild  And no Jrue for most of it"
Patty Mills is really the final evolution of GTJ. we paid the wrong guy
the nets role players other than patty mills have looked fucking useless
Where's Patty Mills on #NBA75?
"You have Patty Mills, so what's the difference"
Patty Mills may never miss a three again.
Patty Mills or prime Jordan Nwora?
Without patty mills this would be a blowout
Some people out there legit thought Patty Mills wasn't a massive needle mover lmaooo
Patty Mills&gt;Steph Carry
Patty Mills what a fucking legend. Go Aussie!
Patty Mills is 6-6 from 3
Patty Mills &gt; Kyrie
Someone needs to tell Patty Mills to calm the fuck down
Oh right this super team casually got patty mills
Patty Mills carrying so hard
PATTY MILLS MVP
Patty Mills officially goat
Patty Mills going 6 for 6 from 3 and the Nets still losing by double digits has gotta hurt
Please make Patty Mills go away
Patty Mills needs the Fred VanVleet barriers that block him from going inside the 3 point line lol
Without Patty Mills this is a blowout
Patty Mills still in olympic mode
Patty mills can’t miss
Patty Mills = Curry Down Under?
I love Patty Mills but I fucking hate that guy
God I love Patty Mills 😍😍😍
someone told Patty Mills it’s the olympics
Jordan Nwora has taken more shots than Patty Mills with half the points.
They should play patty mills more. Nash needs coaching about coaching lol
Shame we never got to see Patty Mills play with Joe Ingles in the NBA
&gt; Patty Mills underrated as fuck  FTFY
Patty Mills looking great
Patty Mills passing underrated as fuck
So who is Patty Mills and why is he better than Steph Curry?
Patty Mills is really fun to watch. Old man just zooming around off the ball and making plays.
"Giannis First Half Stats: 18 PTS on 7-17 shooting (1-2 from 3 and 3-4 FT) 9 REB; 3 AST; 1 BLK.  Durant First Half Stats: 11 PTS on 5-12 shooting (1-4 from 3) 5 REB; 2 AST; 1 BLK  Harden First Half Stats: 15 PTS on 5-9 shooting (3-6 from 3, 2-2 FT) 3 REB; 3 AST; 2 BLK  Patty Mills First Half Stats: 15 PTS on 5-5 shooting (5-5 from 3) 2 AST; 1 REB; 1 BLK"
After the Olympics you start Joe Harris who lost the nets the finals over patty mills   Put Harden SG Mills runs point. Giannis too good.
They do have a premier collection of offensive talent and also Patty Mills.
It’s a shame Brooklyn don’t have Kyrie to cover if Patty Mills gets hurt
Patty Mills finally got the supporting casts he needed to get his second ring
"If Olympic Patty Mills shows up this season, league fucked"
Don't know why all of the people are talking as if Patty Mills wouldn't be playing with Kyrie.  He'd 100% be playing more minutes than Harris if he is playing like this.
Patty Mills signing of the off season fight me
Just checking in from the box score. Patty mills going 5 for 5 from 3 while kyrie is sitting is another plot line starting that I love. Wish it was against Ben Simmons tho. Fake v Real Aussie
Stupid ass Lakers signed Nunn over Patty Mills
Is BKN Patty Mills the real MVP?? lmao
don't insult Patty Mills like that
Patty mills cooking
Patty Mills what a pick up wtf
I've fallen in love with Patty Mills
And Patty Mills
Thank you KD and Patty Mills for making this game interesting again.
Is patty mills the next magic Johnson??
Patty Mills flair complimenting GTJ....just father/son things I guess haha
"Fatboy Slim Duo showed up today. Slim Reaper doing slim reaper's thing. I'm literally convinced that not playing 18 monts of organized basketball was good for KD. Ooh and LaMarcusMidrange don't seem he want to cool off. Patty Mills with the 2cnd highest +/- of the team on a cold shooting night, Millsap with the 3rd one. That team is fun, Harden is finding his groove and he's adjusting his game with the new rules. S/o to Jevon Carter too."
They already have Patty Mills
Then I saw him prancing about at Wimbledon while the boys were in Tokyo. I'd l give my left nut to spend a few weeks in camp with Patty Mills and Joe Ingles and the rest of the team!
"patty mills, maybe andrew bogut at some point.  josh jackson, josh hart, josh richardson, etc etc.."
"I agree. Not only do they have Patty Mills, but they also have KD"
Patty Mills is the second best player on the team. I'm talking about Bruce Brown
"I'm a big fan of patty mills, but I wouldn't go that far."
Jr looks like Patty Mills
"Yeah, and Wiggins is better than an MLE player. Not having Wiggins so you can sign an MLE guy is a net loss (except for Lacob's wallet).  (Wiggins isn't worth his contract. He's also worth WAY more than $5m.)  Also, worth pointing out, they aren't looking like a team that needs an MLE guy right now.   (I like Patty Mills, and I like Nic Batum. It's not clear that the Warriors are better if you replace GP2 or Otto Porter with either of those players.)"
"They  converted a future protected 1st into a lottery 1st this year (Kuminga) as part of that deal.  That's a huge win for flexibility. The 2 second round picks for D'lo are whatever, just 2nd round picks.  They offered the MLE to both Patty Mills and Batum who declined and then pivoted to sign Bjelica and OPJ on vet min deals instead.  Why use a MLE when a vet min can you get the same level of production?"
"Agree to Disagree I guess  KD had a healthy Kyrie for over half that series, the only game he actually carried them to a win was game 5. Lets not rewrite history, he was fantastic in that series but he wasn’t completely alone for the whole series   Not to mention that the bucks just weren’t a very good offense compared to a team like the clippers for example, at least in that series they were stagnant and very predictable.  Keeping up the defense through ten regular season games doesn’t mean they can play guys like Aldridge, Blake, Patty Mills of even Harris against a healthy GSW(which we project to be a top 5 offense at least).   I don’t think they have enough firepower as is to make up for all the holes in the roster but thats just me. Even the KD Warriors needed to rely on defense and grit to win championships"
"In a battle between ex-Spurs DeMar DeRozan triumphs over Patty Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge, 118-95."
"I love Vuc putting his head down and running hard, only to give up realizing there was no way he'd catch up to Patty Mills."
"that's the real question, who's gonna break the record and do the same stat line with black socks.  Patty Mills maybe."
Patty Mills have been making up for Harden when he subs into the game. His aggressiveness is always right on time.
Patty mills :)
"I would trust patty mills as our 2nd string PG tbh, our real problem is offensive rebound, we do not have the heat mentality to take the offensive rebound, if we do we would simply be the no. 1 seed even without kyrie"
I like watching FVV.  I hoped he might turn out pretty good watching him a bunch a couple of years ago.  Wish I'd seen this one because I also enjoy Patty Mills' game.
He plays like international play Patty Mills on steroids so I guess I can at least see the comp but even as a big Patty fan I can say the potential is just on a different level
Some dude was saying his ceiling is Patty Mills a couple days ago 😂
I hate that walmart patty mills lookin ass
Patty mills is cool
True but don’t you dare try and take away our main Australian. I don’t think I’ve ever loved a net as fast as Patty Mills
"Add to that 6. Leaving Patty Mills open all the time.                                    7. Defensive intensity was off all game, especially 2nd half"
"These corner threes been killing us man, idk why we're still gambling on steals and leaving patty mills open"
Nephew you're scrambling harder than Patty Mills
Patty Mills
I mean Durant is gonna get his 30 piece regardless. It's about stopping Harden and the supporting cast. Patty Mills can always pop off.
"Not gonna lie, Blake Griffin, with his cruisy childhood playing in a gym his friend's dad owned and for his high school team his own dad coached before being the first overall draft pick, thinking he gets to decide on the ""blue collar""... Well, anything, really, but in particular the credentials of an Indigenous man from Canberra whose mother was one of the Stolen Generation and who barely got drafted at all and went on to become an NBA champion (not that you'd know what that's like, Blake), the third Indigenous man to represent Australia in basketball, and one of Australia's first Olympic medalists in basketball...  Fuck you actually, Blake, you soft-as ring-chasing bitch. If you were a tenth as tough as Patty Mills you might have had a prayer of winning a ring without hoping to get carried by better players than you've ever been or ever will be."
"Lmao get real. Kyrie is coming back before the playoffs. Even if he doesn’t they have Patty Mills anyways. They almost beat the bucks with injured Harden, and Harden should be healed up by the playoffs"
"He's a role player being treated as a star. From what I've seen he either can't or doesn't want to create off the dribble. His only scoring ability is the catch and shoot off the curl screen. I don't know how well he's shooting those but when I've watched games it's brick after brick.  Probably having Jamal out means the other team can put more defensive pressure on him. On ball he can't do anything like I said and off ball it's harder to lose him on screens because he has more attention. Like I said, a 6'9 version of Patty Mills who people think is a leading scorer (I love Mills and how he knows what he's great at and does that thing)."
I would love to see Patty Mills win it
Im offended for Patty Mills on this one.
"We've already had a run with Patty Mills, though I'm not opposed to running it back."
Olyroos is the men's under 23 soccer team. Patty Mills plays for the Boomers.
"If you're Australian, these are the teams with Aussies playing on them.  Oklahoma City - Josh Giddey, in his first year. The team is terrible, but getting better. Giddey can pass like he's been in the league for ten years.   Philadelphia - Matisse Thybulle, a defensive specialist who is a bundle of energy. Ignore The Yank, who refuses to play for Australia and is getting shipped out of Philly to somewhere hopeless, as soon as anyone (cough Minny cough) is dumb enough to make an offer for the lazy, mentally weak overpaid coward who *refuses to play for Australia*.  Brooklyn - Patty Mills has joined this year, and is hitting long shots like he  has a laser sight. Olympic Patty is the absolute foundation of the Ollyroos, and he's as fine an Australian sportsman as you'll see.  Utah - Joe Ingles is coming to the end of his storied career, and he plays for the Jazz. Opposing teams still get Jingled. Repeatedly.  San Antonio - Jock Landale, another Autralian young gun, plays here. Jock is quietly building himself a quite decent NBA resume.  Dallas - Josh Green is coming off the bench for them.  Me, I'd be picking Oklahoma City - they are going to lose a lot, but you'll get to grow with the team.  And Giddey is an absolutely insane prospect. He is likely to be the youngest ever player to get 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the NBA - he has done all of these things, but not in the same game. And he wears a flanno to media interviews - what's not to love :)"
My bala Patty Mills and Tyler Herro get my votes
Patty Mills  Kemba? Or is he more of a #2 ?  For the hawks it alternates between cam reddish and DeAndre Hunter lol
"Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Deandre Bembry, Patty Mills. The Nets front office is world class."
Patty Mills is insane
Not as impactful as some other names on other teams but patty mills and DeAndre bembry have been great
With how Patty Mills is playing rn I did
I mean it would have been sick to get Patty Mills. Bob did a great job despite not getting his main targets though. He's such a good GM.
There is a dude on the Raps that look just like Patty Mills.
Who let us have Patty Mills…
"LMA &amp; Patty Mills, I love you"
"Patty Mills, KD, and Harden will pick up the slack. Man if only Kyrie wasn't being stupid.."
Patty Mills really did break Luka in the Olympics.
"Harden is starting to get a bit better, but Steve Nash continues his questionable rotations. It’s fine at this stage of the year, but I’d like to see a more consistent line up going into December.   DeAndre Bembry is looking like a good addition, though with Carter and Brown idk how we’ll be splitting the defensive guard minutes. Whenever Kyrie decides to get vaxxed we’ll see how the rotations end up.   Joe Harris has lost it, but thankfully Patty Mills has been picking up the slack for it. I don’t necessarily regret giving him the money, but he something is definitely off with him.   The team still needs a big man who can rebound, it’s been a glaring weakness for a couple years and I hope this is the thing they address closer to the trade deadline. I don’t know who is for sale, but I think that’s the necessary piece to put this team into a better spot (and getting Kyrie back for more scoring of course)."
"Their main direction is they got rid of DeRozan, LMA and Patty Mills. None of this 10th-12th seed nonsense, they can just tank for a good pick."
Trae Young would be Patty Mills in the Western Conference
Yeah quality more than playstyle. Patty Mills is one of the best backups around.
"Spurs.  Mostly positive.  The effort level is inspiring and the team competes hard.  Their record reflects the talent level, but until the Indy game, they were competitive every night.    Some of the talent hasn’t taken the step I hoped for (primarily Lonnie Walker and Derrick White, who seem to have plateaued), but it’s a developmental year, so too early to judge them harshly.  We won’t see the Spurs lottery pick (Primo) until late in the season.  Murray’s attitude as a leader has been huge, and he is the heart and soul of the team that was needed once Patty Mills left.  Keldon is in a slump, but is still on the right track.  Poeltl has been great and worth every penny.   Spurs are at 2-5, which is expected.  They need 24 to get the record for Pop, which is achievable.  They’re on track to be a bottom-5 team that competes every night, which is all I could hope for."
"Yeah I have no idea how the Patty Mills comparison works, unless he's talking about the quality of Cole as a player rather than playstyle."
&gt; Cole can become a serviceable backup guard on a good team I think. Like a Patty Mills.      That ceiling is ridiculously low unless you haven’t watched Cole play this year.
"Cole can become a serviceable backup guard on a good team I think. Like a Patty Mills.   Extremely early days but Suggs doesn’t look good at all, he doesn’t seem to have any skill or standout attribute to his game. But I didn’t watch him in college so can’t really tell his potential."
"He's like Australian Patty Mills, lol."
"So who really won the trade between Gary ""it's actually Patty Mills with defense"" Trent or Normal ""the other OG"" Powell?  Double win?"
Plays a lot like international play Patty Mills with the aggression
He reminds me of Patty Mills.
They’re totally just holdover fans from the pre-Spurs Patty Mills era
"Even his defense has been better since he’s being hidden as a small ball 4 rather than the 2 he was in Toronto.  But he’s gotten better as he’s gotten older, I’ll defend that last year was his best season, just no one watched the Spurs. 60% TS over the last 2 years  The past few years his team has only looked worse with him off because Patty Mills was one of the best sixth men in the game who destroyed opposing benches"
"I think the nets are still experimenting a lot. To start it seems like harden, Bruce, Joe, kd and blake/Claxton. Patty mills comes in first for Joe followed by Millsap or Aldridge for blake or clax. We've been using Jevon and bembry a lot too. The line ups with bruce, patty, bembry, or jevon  together have been pretty amazing defensively."
"Trait/role:   solid screener - Marcin Gortat  backup PG - Ish Smith, Patty Mills, Nate Robinson  passing big - Nene, Joakim Noah"
He was good at the Olympics with Jingles and Patty Mills.  He kept the ball moving in tempo and he's good at off-ball motion and screening and he'll be a good piece in a reasonably complex offense.    Just don't ask him to dribble or shoot and it's all good.
Patty mills
Patty Mills is the Wizards curse
He and Patty Mills go to the same barber?
Sorry.  Patty mills is a bloody legend and straight up human being.  He will become the glue for this bunch of Brooklyn freaks.
The real answer here is going harder after patty mills and promising him the starting job
1. Patty Mills 2. Joe Ingles
We missed out on Patty Mills
"Yeah I get it, the greater Houston area is absolutely enormous. It's just something I can't relate to, because in San Antonio, it's way smaller of a city and all the focus is on one team.   I can make small talk with almost anyone about the Spurs anywhere I go. I've met someone who was in the elderly age range tell me about how she saw Luka Samanic at HEB, or a family friends wife, whose in her late 40s, talk to me about Patty Mills like its nothing."
"The bulls? Honestly think they’re close and just need some reliable vets off the bench next to caruso. Like a Terrance Ross, thadeus young, Jeff green, patty mills, Alec burks, Derrick favors, etc type vets for a 9-10 deep playoff squad"
But is that a result of getting Patty Mills or guys like Deandre Bembry and Jevon Carter?
Didn't Udoka say he knew how to lock Patty Mills up? lol
God as my witness I was telling my friend right before tip that I’ve never seen Patty Mills miss a 3 in a game I was watching live
I don’t mean to overreact but I’d die for Patty Mills.
Patty Mills 🔥
patty mills doesn't miss
How are Patty Mills and Jeff Green even remotely similar players?
We signed Patty Mills instead of Jeff and Patty has been fantastic
Griffin is ass for the time being. This roster wasn't constructed for a 37 year old LaMarcus Aldridge and patty mills to score 15-20 points every game to win. As it is built now it also isn't optimized for harden or kd atleast not without kyrie. Just because we have players that can contribute doesn't mean there isn't flaws in a roster that was built under the assumption they'd have a 27ppg 50/40/90 scorer.
I’ve been taking every opportunity to trash the NBA’s Australian fan base just because of the AUDACITY of hundreds of Aussies  in that USA vs Australia Olympic thread   If you were there you know why lol  Mfs had a 11 point lead n just started deciding to shit on our country and the entirety of the NBA  Bitch Patty mills ya best player . Suck my red white n blue nuts you wish app Englishmen
Patty Mills
I have not watched a lot of Nets games but from the outside Harden seems to be getting off his slow start. KD is just a monster and Patty Mills could be huge in the Playoffs. Knicks live by their 3-PT shooting and their bench picking up the starters bad stretches.
"Kawhi, Patty Mills, and Cory Joseph the only guys left in the league from the 2014 championship roster."
Fuck Patty Mills
Patty mills
"Patty Mills has had several truly terrible games though.  Glancing at his game log, in his 6 worst games this season he shot a combined 8-for-47 from the field. A combined 25 points in 150 minutes.  An 0-for-4 game, a 2-for-9 game, a 2-for-10 game, a 1-for-9 game, a 2-for-8 game, and a 1-for-7 game.  And it's not like all of his other games were good. There were other mediocre ones, just not as bad as those 6.  I've honestly been pretty disappointed with him overall thus far. He's had like 5 good games (some of them great) and the rest either unremarkable or bad."
Patty Mills
Rondo and Patty Mills
"Patty mills on the nets plays like a mini steph, Running around like crazy and knocking down shots like nothing.   The steph down under"
arent all the basketball highlight nfts lame ass basic plays. People really out there spending $500 on a mp4 of Patty Mills hitting his 53rd 3 of the season lol
Patty Mills carrying the Nets as usual.
Warriors ran a box and one on Patty Mills lol. They proceeded to triangle and two on Harden/Durant. And there’s some funny clips of Kerr holding up a triangle to signal it in and the announcers commenting about the janky defense. They like to box and one when GP2 is out there. They also ran box and one vs several other teams.
Gary Trent Jr looks like Patty Mills.
Wheres the guy that asked if Patty Mills is better today?
Shout-out to Patty Mills who is second in 3p% with like 3 times as many makes as JV.
&gt;	Acting like all a ball has to be is round to make a shot….  [Agreed](https://i.imgur.com/Bs6G2ax.gifv)  *– Patty Mills*
Patty Mills
&gt; Just that every second basketball-liking dude in Australia right now is gonna tell you they're a Bucks fan or at the very least that they love Giannis so just be ready for that.  Are they really that big on Oz? I figured there'd be a lot of Nets/76ers fans with Patty Mills/Matisse Thybulle.
"It's nothing against you guys in particular, I just root against any and all big market teams, except the Nets because Patty Mills/LMA"
"LMA and Patty Mills have played together in Portland, San Antonio and now Brooklyn."
"Gary Payton II- about 2m. Shoots 70%&amp;47% from 3. Obviously on very low volume, dunks&amp; open 3s, but good shot selection is difficult to come by&amp;does it while playing amazing defense   Patty Mills- 12m shooting 48% from 3"
Patty Mills
Having Patty Mills and Joe Ingles on the same team would be too much for the league to handle
Patty Mills
"Given he and patty mills used to roll around canberra in patty's beaten up old mazda 626 back when they were teenagers at the AIS,  i would say that's more than likely.  Studies of Canberra residents have shown there is a 100% correlation between early model mazda 626 ownership and enjoying a late night session at the Belconnen skatepark followed by a sausage and egg mcmuffin once maccas opens."
This game is going to come down to Patty Mills &amp; Terrance Ross out heat-checking each other.
Patty Mills is so damn good. I love watching him even if he’s playing against us
We did this vs Patty Mills of all people
Patty Mills wasn’t too far off in the first game this season when he went 7/7
Patty Mills is clearly the better dunker
Nets - Patty Mills
has joe harris ever recorded a nba dunk lmao?  best current dunker on the nets is clearly patty mills
Andrew Gaze tag  Hypes up Patty Mills  How do I know you're Aussie?
King size Patty Mills has been on fire all night.
"Then acquire Patty Mills, that’s a recipe for success"
"Patty Mills, Gary Trent and Seth Curry. The Blazers had some serious talent they let slip away."
"Alex Caruso,juan Tuscano Anderson,Patty Mills,Kyle Kuzma,Harrison Barnes"
If Patty Mills is 6'0...
"Griffin and Millsap aren't exactly great so far this season, I'll give you that. But Aldridge has literally been their best bench player, with Patty Mills not too far behind. And I should remind you that Blake was probably one of—maybe even the only—consistently positive player KD had for support on the court. Things change and this year is not last year, but still.  Harris on defense is true, he's had A LOT of yikes on that side of the ball.  Harden is hampered by the free throws, but should not and does not need them to be a superstar or the like.   Kyrie is an unfortunate blow because it gets rid of our most explosive piece of versatile offense. Mills somewhat replicates that, but he has too many cold  nights and lacks the complete arsenal. Bruce Brown is a similar story, though he can play some D to make up with it. I just wish we had even a third of the cap Kyrie is taking to just get a decent compliment shooter. I'm tired of seeing 40 ""almost"" assists a night. I'm tired of not having a second unit that can hold a lead.  But Nets gotta ride above. KD is KD and can do whatever he wants if he plays smart and to his ability. Harden gotta get straight. Those two alone should have gotten us at least one win out of those losses, but it's just not completely clicking yet, though it gets a little better every game.  A little off subject and long winded, but you are underestimating what the Nets have in their arsenal. It's not fantastic beyond KD and Harden, some could argue just beyond KD, but it's not terrible. At the same time, I get that some people outside of Nets fandom are grossly overestimating how the Nets as they are should be performing. Either way, they should be a little better than what they are now."
Patty Mills low key is leading +/- in a lot of these games for Nets
"That’s definitely not true. While Curry is for sure an amazing finisher, Kobe is certainly better within the three point line. You have to remember that Currys outside shooting ability opens up so many good looks from 2pt range. When it comes to contested jumpers Kobe is the GOAT. You have to factor in level of difficulty of shots and volume. Your argument is comparable to saying that a spot up shooter like Patty Mills is better from 3 than Harden."
This man makes Patty Mills look like a kindergartener. Lord help us.
"Ah yes, the ""no help"" consisting of James Harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge, Joe Harris, etc. Like if you can't at least go deep in the playoffs with that roster, you might not be as great as you think. Kyrie should be what separates them from ""Clear title favorites"" vs ""One of the most stacked teams of all time"". Anyone who even implies that KD doesn't have enough help is smoking huge amounts of crack."
"Nets offense is a big house of cards rn.  Their only interior penetration is Harden and Kyrie, one is not present, the other is not the same.   Without this, the offense is reliant on outside shotmaking, which is something that Kyrie is obviously good at, but also missing people like Joe Harris or Blake Griffin being insanely cold and the Nets needing more defensive-specialists like Carter or Bembry or Brown (through Brown has at least found other ways to be active on offense)  When all of that is failing, then it's just up to KD to hit shots. If Harden is having a bad night, and then the combination of Patty Mills and Joe Harris don't hit 6 3s combined, it's just KD left, especially against teams where Aldridge can't play because he'd be a defensive liability.  Kyrie would fix A LOT of this, by adding another + healthy interior penetrator, another outside shooter, AND another iso shotmaker. Alternatively, if Harden gets healthier he can get the offense moving more and less jump shot reliant, but that's also a bit limited since he hasn't been a consistent threat in the paint and the only Nets big that's a lob threat has been out almost the whole season"
"He's got help. I hate this absolutism.   Joe Harris is great. Not to mention Harden, even if he isn't Harden of old.   LMA, Patty Mills.   But yeah... Kyrie... that sucks."
"Before it was, ""Look at everyone the nets are getting:  KD, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, etc, etc.""    Now it's ""KD has no help."""
Smh at this Patty Mills slander
"This no help thing is so confusing. Like, ignoring that Harden was the best player on the Nets last night, the Nets have Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, LMA, and a few other solid role players. Their roster is the most talented in the league."
"In all seriousness, Javale McGee. [He's had a wild ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaVale_McGee). He started his career on the shitshow Wizards. He's won rings with the Warriors and Lakers, and he's got an Olympic gold medal under Pop. He's been the knucklehead rookie, and he's been the grizzled vet. Everyone with a non-Shaquille first name seems to love him. I think he'd do well.   The other guy who comes to mind is Patty Mills- centuries of experience under Pop and with the Aussie National team, generally solid dude, can probably bitch out a ref with the best of em."
"I think it honestly shocked the Nets, they weren’t prepared for that to happen to Patty Mills and it really hurt their offense. Kyrie Irving aside, if Joe Harris was out there then maybe the triangle and 2 wouldn’t have worked as well. But besides the defensive scheme, the warriors were all over defenders and passing lanes. A lot of strips and deflections. Great effort"
"I love how James Harden, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, and solid roleplayers represents “no help”. How exactly is the Warriors current roster outside of Steph any different than what KD has?  Plus the Nets are 10-5. Everyone is acting like they might miss the playoffs or something lol."
I think its so interesting that Kerr is throwing all sorts of janky defenses at these star-heavy teams this season. It seems like the Nick Nurse experience really imprinted on him. Did we really see a box-and-one for Patty Mills??   I do wonder if this will translate in the playoffs but for now it seems to be throwing people off their groove.

"I think having a PF rotation of Griffin, Millsap, and Aldridge (who combined don’t even make $9 million) means they’re still in a much better position than most teams.  And they got a great sharpshooter in Patty Mills for only $6M this year."
"Know you're joking but there is a few differences. I would add LMA who was still with us , Gay , patty Mills who was hot and not having to play Bryn"
imagine if they actually got batum or patty mills
"The defense is good, but when you have 2 great players, 1 good player and nothing but scrubs, it's easier to clamp them down. The rest of the Nets bench were so bad the Warriors were running box-and-one on Patty Mills."
Watching kuminga iso patty mills in the post  only to have Poole shoot a contested step back 3 is as bad as looneys hips
"While the 76ers struggle to look for a team to trade for all star point guard Ben simmons, they should at least consider a three way deal that involves Kyrie Irving and Russel Westbrook. It is proven that irving is lost because of the vaccine issue and basically the nets seems to already move on from him since they already have harden and Patty mills. Nets seem to lack a facillitator point guard not a scorer so simmons might be a good fit. Westbrook on the other hand seems to struggle to fit in the laker culture with all these lowest of low games despite having highest of high games(which he is not consistent with) so he seems to be quite fit when he plays with a team with at least 1 allstar big in the name of Joel Embiid, embidd plus westbrook would be a threat to the pick and roll game and would crush the boards and wreck havoc inside. Then that puts us left with irving going to LA, him reconciling with bron + playing with AD(a better PF than love) would make a lot more sense. Considering irving is also lost without bron, this trade would really make sense and would shock the whole nba."
Must have been rough facing that kind of defense from GSW.  Harden and Durant on the floor? Triangle and 2  Patty Mills getting something going? Get him on a Box and 1
That patty mills clone looked great
No box and one unless it's for Patty Mills tho
I feel for Patty Mills. I miss free throws just like that all day.
I love Patty Mills.

who needs joe harris when you have patty mills?
"No one is mentioning any role players, so how 'bout this: Patty Mills. He played for the Spurs for 10 years and was an important contributor in the Finals win over the Heat.  Spurs fans, wasn't he a fan favorite too?"
I just feel like there is alot of better option than having Westbrook. Maybe Patty Mills with Buddy. Westbrook suppose to help them win while Lebron is out but its not looking good
Us spurs fans would die for Patty Mills.
NBA Champion Patty Mills still exists and he was drafted 55th
Patty mills
He’s definitely picked up the torch from his dad Patty Mills
"Not player but Spurs v GSW game 1 of the 2015-2016 season where Kawhi, Manu and Patty Mills and the Spurs spearheaded through the soon-to-be GSW dynasty.   But Kawhi's game Vs Philly game 7 and one game the Spurs actually lost, MEM v SPURS GM 4 2017 playoffs"
"I really can’t fathom how much better I think the Lakers would’ve been had this off-season went completely different. Keep Caruso, trade for Buddy, and they’d still have Harrell, KCP, and potentially Schroeder and THT depending on what trades they could’ve lined up.   If they still snag Rondo, Dwight, Ellington, and Bazemore, I think trying to flip Schroeder and Harrell or maybe just Harrell and KCP plus for a good shooting PG, they’d be looking great. Hell, maybe they’re able to get George Hill or Patty Mills somehow. I wanna see LeBron finish his career on a good note but I’m skeptical it’ll happen with these weirdly constructed Lakers teams."
I feel like Patty Mills is doing what you are paying Joe Harris to do.
"Patty Mills is an amazing guard man. Doesnt dance with the ball too much, can hit a catch and shoot three, isnt absolutely horrendous on defense, and turnover ratio isnt sky high. Not a superstar but a coaches dream."
can’t believe the nets got fuckin patty mills fuck
Thats Australian of the year Patty Mills!
Jesus Christ KD is on a tear and holy shit him and Patty Mills 👀👀
patty mills too!
There is no FIBA basketball. There is only Patty Mills.
France- Rudy gobert  Argentina - Facundo Campazzo  Japan - Rui Hachimura  Ausie - patty Mills  Italy - Danilo Gallinari  Spain - gasol brothers    I just named 1 player for most of the team. Iran don't have a nba player so we can expect them to get blown out.
"I get your point that it's not really accurate to suggest it's NBA talent vs a whole bunch of not NBA talent, but Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova, Matisse Thybull, and Josh Green vs Damien Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Jarami Grant, Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Zach LaVine, and Jayson Tatum isn't exactly close in individual talent."
Yea I’m sorry but if a guy like KD or Tatum can’t cover Patty Mills on a back cut then that’s not really on pop. Those guys have no issue doing that in the nba. Defensive effort has been atrocious these two games. They’re playing entitled as hell and I think Pop is trying to make the point to his team that that will not work.

Lmao awful post.   Kds defense is fine and a couple highlights isn’t gonna change the fact that’s it’s even been fine in the Olympics.  Net negative or pretending he always gets blown by is actually hilarious though. A Patty Mills highlight isn’t gonna change what he did as an isolation player these past playoffs.
I mean I would expect 4 max players not to get out played by Patty Mills at any level but what do I know.   Also this is probably the last time we have a NBA head coach.

Olympic Patty Mills &gt; Michael Jordan. Tell me I’m lying.
"Patty Mills was actually hunting out KD in iso and going to work.   Never understand why people just throw out ""he can guard 1-5"" when talking about bigs (you especially hear this when it comes to draft prospects).. most above average NBA guards will cook any 7-footer on an island ..and this is KD who might be the most mobile 7-footer in the league"
Patty Mills was cooking KD and it genuinely looked like there was nothing KD could do. *oh how the tables turn...*
"Stephen A:  There is no reason [To lose to] some dude name Patty TheDestroyer, who goes by Patty Mills for the San Antonio Spurs. Or Joe Ingles. Or Thyb…however the hell you pronounce his name."

australian talent pool is smaller so guys like patty mills and joe ingles have played in multiple tournaments together  it's not about seeing each other lol. playing versus each other doesn't build chemistry at all
Dont we have book middleton and holiday on the wAy tho? Lol  3 players better than patty mills who is apparently the best Olympic basketball player ever
just realized only draymond can play defense in this roster.   the rest has really low defensive iq.   goes to show how they got terrorized by patty mills.

"There are a number of acceptable UFA PGs right now, but LeBron will need to put the sales pitch on.  He could go all Tom Brady and convince CP3 or Mike Conley to play for cheap.  There really is a non-zero chance of that happening.  He can convince Reggie Jackson to leave the Clippers and get a ring.  Patty Mills and Dinwiddie are FAs.  If this wasn't LA and LeBron wasn't on the team, Schroder would have a ton of leverage.  But it is LA and LeBron is on the team for the next 2 years."
The Canadian Patty Mills
"I agree Jackson is arguably the better coach, but the way this worded makes Pop seem carried by Duncan and blames him for Kawhi which is 100% not true. Duncan as good as he was wasn't the reason Tony Parker, Ginobili, Kawhi all developed into good players. This also doesn't take into account the insane amount of player Pop brought the best out of players like Patty Mills, Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, George Hill, Danny Green, Dejuan Blair, and the list goes on. The guy is a minimum Top 5 coach all time minimum and I would go even as far as to say he's probably higher than that. I think the idea that he's overrated is just simply not true."
"It's disappointing, the kid has shown he has no heart. But on the opposite end we have patty mills who is nothing but heart. This bloke fills me with pride everyone he takes the court, I know he gives it his all, 100% of the time."
"I swear this is genuine curiosity and I’m not trying to be offensive, but I wonder if there’s something culturally with elite Australian athletes that makes them more likely to not really be passionate about their sports. Obviously there are guys like Patty Mills, Delly, Bogut, Lleyton Hewitt, etc. who this does not apply to, but there’s also Bernard Tomic who had pretty high potential but seemed to hate tennis and retired very young after basically not trying for years. Nick Kyrgios also has never gotten even close to living up to his potential, and has publicly said at least once that he only plays tennis for the money."
"My favorite patty mills memory was early in his career I was at a game and we were winning late, so he got put in for garbage time. It was the final possession and we were at 97 points so we needed a 3 for free chalupas (which the whole crowd was cheering for). On the final possession he caught the ball in the corner… and stepped out of bounds. Most laughter ive ever heard in the rose garden (moda for the uninitiated)"
"LeBron - It’s fun to root against the best player, and his stans are annoying as fuck  KD - Ruined competitive basketball by joining the Warriors and fucked up our chances to win a ship  Giannis - I just feel like I wouldn’t like him irl.

Just a general nuisance  Trez - Guy who thinks he’s a lot better than he is  Zubac - Everytime I watch the Clippers his general attitude annoys me  The Morris Twins - straight Menaces to society  Patty Mills - Spurs fans fucking love this guy even though he’s so average. I hate the Spurs"

Just realizing I’ve never heard Patty Mills speak.
"First, I fucking love Patty Mills.  Second, I'm sure this very case was made to Ben in the last few weeks, and Ben may have even agreed with it, but I think he saw a chance to get out from under the media spotlight for a couple of months and jumped at it. He's afraid of facing his weaknesses, which is the reason I don't believe he'll work on his shooting or mentality this off-season, or ever. It's not laziness, it's fear.  As I was watching the playoffs I couldn't stop thinking that the best thing for Ben was to get around Millsy, Ingles and Delli, both for shooting reasons and mental reasons. But I was also about 90% sure he wouldn't do it."
"Patty Mills and Jingles will always be held higher than Bogut in my eyes. Gaze and Longley are aight.   Matisse Thybulle though, he the low-key dark horse fan fave"

Patty Mills for PM
I’m just learning patty mills is an Aussie lol
"If you see old Australian TV commercials the accent is a lot closer to british then the aussie accent today.   Another thing of note that non aussies might find interesting is that theirs really only 3 main accents in Australia, and its not so much regional based like how californians sound different to yanks and moreso to do with how you were brought up socioeconomically. So people from the west coast can end up sounding exactly like people from the east coast (4000km away).  the accents are:  broad - [steve irwin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlDXZywedvc)  general - patty mills accent  cultivated - [How this sounds](https://youtu.be/ZnioDeQNlxQ?t=137)"
"I had never heard Patty mills speak until now. I knew he was Australian, but still, I wasn't expecting the accent lmao"
&gt;Patty Mills turns into fire incarnate while playing for Australia.  SA would probably have a couple more titles if they just wore green and gold. He turns into FIBA Curry in those colors.
"&gt;	Patty Mills is largely responsible for the rise of Australia as a basketball afterthought to consistently a top 4 placer in major basketball events  While I’m a massive patty mills fan and I agree that he’s a big reason for our recent success in basketball tournaments, let’s not forget that from the late 80s to 2000, Australia had some very strong teams led by Andrew Gaze and we placed 4th at the Olympics in 88, 96, 2000(and 6th in 92).  We didn’t do so well after that until the last few years, but Australia has been a force on the worldwide stage a lot longer than that"
I'd follow him into a burning building after that speech.  Patty Mills a great leader - what a guy; I had no idea
You can’t tell me his greatest chance of a successful turnaround/transformation wasn’t doing trust falls into Patty Mills &amp; Aron Baynes’ arms while Powderfinger plays in the background.  You just can’t.

Fair and reasonable sporting challenge with Patty Mills.   https://youtu.be/bMU59yd9xJM
What happened to the patty mills documentary? It’s been years since the preview. Supposed to be out after the 2014 finals but still no word.
"Kyrie had an American father that was playing pro ball in Australia when he was born and his mother (who died when he was little) was also an American that joined him overseas. He moved to the USA as a toddler once his dad's playing days ended and he doesn't remember it all. I don't think he ever goes back there other than as a tourist. Australia tried to recruit him hard before he was good enough to make Team USA but he always said he only wanted to play for USA and was willing to wait it out to make the team in 2016.  Ben Simmons also had an American father that was playing pro ball in Australia, who married an Australian woman, and Simmons lived in Australia up until high school until he moved to the USA for Basketball development and he still has friends and family in Australia. He even spends time there in the offseason. Australia is his ""home"" and who he represents internationally but he tends to opt out of competitions.   Patty Mills is Australian as it gets. His parents are both indigenous. He had absolutely no ties to the USA until he came there for college. He is very proud to represent Australia in international competition and he wears the jersey every opportunity he gets.   From spectrum of Least to Most Australian, Kyrie is kind of fake Australian, Simmons is fairly Australian and Mills is Australian AF."
Damn I always thought patty mills was like Kyrie / Ben simmons type Aussie   But dude is like Dante Exum/ ingles type Aussie
What about Patty Mills. Doesn't he have a ring?
That doesn’t fix your spacing it actually compounds the issue because Murray and Derozan also aren’t three point shooters. It would be like splitting Ben Simmons into two players who aren’t as good as him.  Shouldn’t you only care about fit around Embiid if you are gonna take a talent hit anyway.  Like Derrick White and Patty Mills are way better fits even if they aren’t as talented as players.  Embiid just needs 4 elite trustworthy shooters around him and Philly could be a top 3 offense because no one can guard Embiid one on one and he’s have to be hard doubled.
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
Yea - Ben's bs about not joining the Boomers to work on his skills doesn't ring true.  Surely playing more basketball in a competitive environment can't hurt  Also he could ask Patty Mills some advice on how to improve his FT and shooting  I imagine practising would be up there

D.J Augustin  Patty mills
"Tony, Manu, Kawhi, LMA, and Tim is an all-time great starting lineup along with great role/bench players in Danny Green, Patty Mills, David West, and Boris Diaw. They were legit 10 man deep as a team. All those players could've been starters on playoff teams. Not to mention they played for Pop who I consider to be the GOAT coach. That's better than any team that Harden has ever played on."
"?? He was super supportive in altering game style for derozan, jokes about patty mills every once in a while, regularly see him talking about Dejounte? Encouraged Slowmo to go get a bag. Kawhi’s beef was basically with the whole Spurs org lol"
How dare you disrespect your franchise goat Patty Mills?
"That's true, compared to other positions, but I mean in general...Spain is regarded as the second force in FIBA basketball, and currently have ZERO Nba All-star talent. Argentina is still relying on 40 yo Luis Scola. France best players is Goubert, second to him there is Evan Fournier. Could you imagine if team USA had to play with someone of Fournier level as their second best player?     Australia has Simmons, then the next in line is Patty Mills. Can you see the disparity I'm talking about?"
"excuse you, but the boomers have FIBA patty mills and the white larry bird, joe ingles. what other team can match that devastating one-two punch?"
Him and Patty Mills were great friends  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH2op9hf5wo
"Pau did good for 2nd best team in euroleague. he still will be a threat, especially with his skill level. dont forget how spurs was written off for many years for being too old but did their thing. also spanish nt pau is different pau than nba pau, same like aussy nt patty mills."
Patty Mills &gt; Ben Simmons
Patty Mills could be the new Derek Fisher.
I’m gonna cry as a Spurs fan if Patty mills is a laker
I like the idea. Plus he’d play with Patty Mills so he could get some of that green and gold pride in his blood.
"Off the top of my head of guys who actually get some minutes: Conley, Garland, Sexton, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, Shroder, Conley, Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  And there's a lot more, but i don't want to google it."
"lmao TIL the Australian national basketball team's mascot is the [Boomers](https://australia.basketball/blog/2021/02/03/australian-mens-basketball-olympic-squad-revealed/).    &gt;Currently ranked #3 in the world, the Boomers will head into Tokyo looking to claim their first ever Olympic Games basketball medal and will do so under the tutelage of Brian Goorjian, who will this year attend his third Olympics as Boomers Head Coach.  I also didn't realize how many NBA players were Aussies.  Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Bynes.  Should be interesting to see how they fare against the US team."
"I am aware of this. I mean Phil Jackson was not a stand-out player. But with Ime Udoka, there were no past talks at all that he was a people person or like a mentoring vet like Patty Mills or Udonis Haslem for example. I just found out that Pop brought Udoka in as part of his staff after his playing career so again another coach out of Pop’s school."
"Patty Mills just turns into fire incarnate whenever he plays for Australia, it's so fun to watch.  I'd look out for France as well."
"My opinion is the NBA for some reason doesn't market smaller market teams and focuses too much on superstars. Even though Tom Brady is the GOAT, you never saw him get as much attention as Lebron does in the NBA. Of course he gets a lot, but so did/does Aaron Rodgers, Mahomes, Peyton Manning, Brees, etc.   The NBA literally had the Spurs dynasty for 20 years and never marketed them properly. The 2010-2016 Spurs had a very diverse roster. Parker/Boris from France, Manu from Argentina, Tiago from Brazil, Marco from Italy, Patty Mills from Australia but NEVER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT! like this is in the middle of the sport being globalized, but they never really tried to market them..."
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
Wow patty Mills
Patty Mills hates us
Absolutely not true.  These specific rules may not affect my team much but these rules and flopping should be removed along with rip throughs and more.  These are not basketball plays and unless your an absolutely biased fan it is not fun to watch someone do this crap whether he is on your team or not.  I find it annoying when my own teams players do a bad flop (Patty Mills for example).
Patty Mills can actually shoot and he's not afraid.
Maybe they can get Embiid and Curry for Patty Mills and Rudy Gay too
Olympics Patty Mills is the GOAT
As an Aussie I never really expected Ben Simmons to play for the Boomers. It's the same lip service we've been hearing from our NBA players for years. 'Yeah I'd love to play for Australia.' Olympics or a World Championship rolls around 'Player x has pulled out of the squad due to y.'   We're used to it. Patty Mills has busted that mould as of late.  Looking forward to seeing those 30 second clips on IG of Ben hitting threes in an open gym with no one around for the third year in a row.
Everyone who knows anything about sports in Australia (most people) know who Patty fkn mills is
The guy could learn so much from spending some time with Patty Mills who is a guy who has supreme confidence in his abilities and isn’t afraid to take a big shot. I mean heck he could learn a tonne from Delly about just playing with some damn passion.
"Fucking jingles and mills games are shown free to air some times also, where are you pulling this shit from? Patty mills is on the news every other day here.. your trippin bro.. fake news"
Ben Simmons for Patty Mills let's goooooooo gospursgo
Give me Patty Mills and Joe Ingles any day. Delly too
Patty Mills was a member of the 2014 Spurs. Most Australians wouldn't even know he exists.
"Exactly.  The most and probably only coverage I've seen of Patty Mills is when he donates to indigenous support systems, which is incredible. But he still doesn't get as much coverage as Simmons. Granted other dude's aren't ""All Stars"" or ""superstars"" but when it comes to representing Australia, they do much more. The last time he was even here he cried because he wasn't treated like he was famous at the Casino."
"Jazz gonna get Simmons and Patty Mills, then bring back Dante Exum as an assistant coach. They playing Pit while the rest of the league is playing Monopoly and they're cornering the market on Australians."
"I mean he's defending Simmons and over here no matter how badly he shits the bed most people will still defend him just because he's our guy.  We're pretty loyal to anyone who makes it in American sports at all, whether they're a 3rd string college kicker or a superstar in the NBA you'll find kids with their jerseys and news articles where it'll be ""Joe Ingles' Jazz won today""  Shit, we still treat Patty Mills and Delly on the same tier as like a Kemba or something"
"Australia has Ben simmons (stocks an all time low and will probably bitch out but still worth mentioning), Joe ingles, patty mills, delly, baynes, thybulle, josh green (Dallas), broekoff (former Dallas), exum and a bunch of other guys who are either in the NBA or have been in the NBA, doubt any non USA national teams entire roster has that kind of depth"
"Meh, I dunno, Gaze was Goat, but it is so hard to compare him to any of the guys that have had long successful NBA careers since he barely played at that level (I know it was a different time he was old by the time he got a chance).   Would you take Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Andrew Gaze or Andrew Bogut with your number all Aussie team if picking them at the start of their careers?"
"He need to go on a walkabout to recover his inner Aussie, returning the next season talking like Crocodile Dundee and shooting like Patty Mills during the Olympics"
Idk international competition Patty Mills give him a run for his money.
"Australia has Patty Mills, they'll be fine."
"It all started with Pop in 2018   ""Kawhi was a great player, but he wasn't a leader,"" Popovich told reporters Saturday. ""Manu [Ginobili] and Patty [Mills] were the leaders. Kawhi's talent will always be missed, but leadership wasn't his deal at the time."""
"As a big of fan of Duncan, that was so painful. Somehow at age 39, he was the only Spur besides Patty Mills to play as good in 2015 as he had in 2014 vs OKC &amp; Miami. Put up 19-11 on 60% shooting for the series against the far younger and more spry Griffin and Jordan and even preserved a win by blocking a Blake Griffin dunk. Then in game 7 on the road he twice ties the game with clutch buckets only to lose to a one-legged Chris Paul after he came about an inch short of getting his finger on the ball.  After that series I can kind of forgive the Clippers falling apart against Houston - those teams shouldn't have met in the first round and whoever was coming out of it was gonna be half-dead for the following series.  (On a side note, it's great to see CP3 *finally* getting his due for being a great playoff performer. Somehow carrying his team to a game-7 win against the defending champs, playing on a *clearly* injured leg while being guarded by Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green with Tim Duncan playing help defense, got quickly forgotten and everyone still talks about his regular season prowess but how he can't bring it in the playoffs in the same way ... smh)."
Patty Mills is the Boomers leader
"Olympic Patty Mills is a beast though, I predict he will carry us a lot"
"uh, doesn't the entire australian national team absolutely hate his guts? and isn't patty mills on that team?"
FIBA Patty Mills is world class
Is Patty Mills available?
"#All-World Starters:   PG: Luka   SG: Bogi  SF: OG   PF: Giannis  C: Jokic   #Bench:   - Bojan, Embiid, Patty Mills, Gobert, Capela, Siakam   #All-American Starters:   PG: Trae   SG: Booker  SF: Brown  PF: Tatum  C: Ayton  #Bench:   - Fox, Mitchell, Bam, Sabonis, Bridges, Randle  The USA is so unbelievably stacked, my goodness."
"Just fucking try at least  It's so pathetic  Give it your best shot, if you miss well shit. This is so much worse.  I mean Giannis faced the hostile away crowd counting and putting him off, what did he do?  He came out at halftime early and practiced his free throws.  Then he made a bunch.  And Simmons just stands there all game and then compares himself to the nets afterward  ""It's hard to win""  No shit man boo fucking hoo  I hope he doesn't play for Australia again. They play with heart, Patty Mills goes all out"
"Patty Mills is the best Aussie player, don't @ me."
"Ben could really benefit from playing in the Olympics and being with the Boomers squad.   He hasn't shown much interest in joining that crew, but being around Patty Mills and Joe Ingles for an extended stretch would do him wonders."
"I thought I read somewhere that he played quite a bit of footy back in the day.  Not like Patty Mills level, but pretty decent?"
and my axe  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  ..but seriously yall still have Patty Mills as well.
As an Australian I am more proud of Patty Mills than I am of Ben Simmons.
"All these players still won’t be enough to stop Boomer Patty Mills, just watch"
Patty fucking Mills you magnificent bastard!
Patty Mills is front runner for 6MOTY (Clarkson not far behind)  If Steph keeps doing Steph things I can see him winning MVP  Rudy Gobert is quietly putting in another DPOY level season  LaMelo will win ROTY  Randle for MIP  *these predictions could all change in a week
Patty Mills 6th man of the year and the Spurs make the playoffs. Book it.
fucking patty mills  he's so annoying to watch  he just does not miss
"fucking patty mills  so annoying watching him  he never misses  (Though if you want to dive into it, apparently haikus are kind of loose in their syllable requirement.)"
fucking patty mills   it's so annoying to watch  seems like he can't miss
"How many times have I said ""God bless Patty Mills"" over the years??"
Those Patty Mills buzzer beaters in OT wow
I am a LMA stan. I am a Demar stan. I am a Keldon stan. I am a Dejounte stan. But I been a Patty Mills Stan for the longest.
I love Patty Mills man
Patty Mills is my dad
fucking patty mills man  it's so annoying watching him  seems like he never misses
Patty Mills 6MOY. Book it.
Is Patty Mills better than Curry? Hot takes here
Patty Mills has minty cold ice in his veins!
"He's not getting as much run as I'd like and he's coming off the bench and not getting many touches since Rudy Gay &amp; Patty Mills in contract years are chucking it but he's been awesome. He's knocking down the 3 and his defensive instincts are unreal even at the NBA level, he just knows where to be and he's got so much potential."
"I stopped watching the game after caruso fouled Patty Mills for a 3 point attempt. It wasn't even a 3 point attempt, Patty just leaned forward to touch Caruso and it was a foul."
"Patty Mills   Not so much for his on court stuff (although he has been great), but his off-court stuff is incredible.   He should be nominated for Australian of the Year and should win."
Patty Mills 6 man of the year
Yup moral victory for us. Our bench was horrible in the 2nd Q. And we had to deal with fiba Patty mills so meh! we will take the L.
"I know the feeling, patty mills hit everything two days ago and went nuclear on us"
I mean if you leave Patty Mills and Rudy Gay open they rarely miss.(Actually Rudy has been missing a lot of open looks lately)
WHY CAN'T PATTY MILLS AND JOKOB POELTL WORK!?!?
patty mills prayer circle
Lol dennis lookin like a patty mills menace out there
GOAT post defense Patty Mills
"In terms of actual length on one team, not ""franchise-level"" players, it would be Udonis Haslem &gt; Stephen Curry &gt; Patty Mills"
"Vassell hasn't been playing a lot other than preseason and last game. But man, oh lord he's good. You might not say it by just looking at the stats but his defensive instinct and team defense is crazy and already elite. It's crazy how much this guy play team defense and help everyone get in position and slow down a lot other team offense. In Preseason nd Last Game he showed that he has no fear to let it fly when it's his time. He scored crazy clutch points against the Clippers! In Preseason he was gettin more touches and now less but it's nice since Pop prolly prefer to let guys like Patty Mills and Rudy Gay shoot more than a rookie but when it happens to him he has no problem and let it fly. Yeah he still needs to improve but he is already a nice role and bench player. Once Derrick White comes back I think he will see his minutes decrease or even totally disappear, unfortunately, but he has a long way, especially next year since all our vets finish their contract.  What about Jalen Smith man? I wanted him sooo badly since he has the perfect skills and everything you need from a center nowadays and it's one of the position we need to improve the most."

Where was this call yesterday when Pat Bev pushed Patty Mills midair?
I mean yeah. We got torched by Patty Mills and Conley. Wtf is Steph about to do to us
"Nah, Australia has Patty Mills."
"""Patty Mills on a hot streak"" is one of the most entertaining things in the NBA to me"
Chris Paul would point out that Patty Mills’ shoelaces violated NBA protocol and therefore void any points he scored while wearing them
Patty Mills (and the Spurs in general) are fun to watch when they're not making your team sweat.

"Patty ""Patrick Mills"" Mills"
FIBA Patty Mills let loose in the NBA tonight
I almost never try to assume if any particular basketball player can actually fight. Patty Mills is an exception.
"Patty ""Steph Curry"" Mills"
Ain't no one give a shit about some bum ass zone d. Patty Mills wasn't in the third quarter almost the entire quarter is the reason the Clumps came back. I mean one Patty came back in the 4th what happened..exactly.
They were kinda funny in the end tbh. Tryna jinx patty mills with the ft and it working lol
"Patty said he was going FIBA Mills, so I mean he did warn the league /s"
"I love Patty Mills  he's still got it, everybody just forgot."
Patty Mills is the greatest basketball player of all time
not if Patty Mills has something to say about it**😈😈😈😈**
FUCK YOU KAWHI  -Patty Mills
Patty Mills refused to let you guys lose. That man would not miss. Absolutely destroyed us.
"The Clippers can't make a habit of going down big in every game, tbh.  Patty Mills really balling out like he's wearing a Boomers jersey lol."
"Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Reggie Jackson, and Luke Kennard were exceptional for the Spurs"
Patty Mills is the greatest Australian player in the NBA
When the Clippers open the doors to go outside Patty Mills shows up.
Props to the Clippers announcer for giving their team a chance by forcing the miss on Patty Mills first free throw via jynx
"Look at Patty Mills, man.  So inspirational."
Is Patty Mills the best player of all time?
We tried so hard to lose this game man  but  Dejounte Murray and Patty Mills
"GG spurs fans - patty mills always lights us up     Also FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP PLAYING REGGIE, LOU, LUKE TOGETHER O\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_O"
Patty Mills to the rescue tho
Patty Mills
Patty Mills is a bad man

Yo but these clips announcers annoying as hell LOL “patty mills haven’t missed a free throw ALLL YEAR.. I repeat alllll year 9/9 he hasn’t missed all year”. Like jeez I get it you’re trying to put the announcers curse but chill
LA Clippers  announced jinxed Patty Mills.
I'm goddamn confused by these LA Clippers. They proceeded to talk about CFB while mixing in Patty Mills trivia.

patty mills is cookin
Patty Mills is on fire
patty mills is a clipper killer
Patty Mills is the greatest player of all time
I don’t know if I’ve ever watched a spurs broadcast but do that commentator usually say “G’day mate!!” when patty mills hits a 3??  Edit: and “oh mama mills!!” This shit is hilarious
"Bucks depth? Last year for sure, but a lot has changed. Are their first 3 off the bench in the playoffs going to be Augustin, Forbes, and Portis? Nets look good on paper in that regard, but they really need another PG to run their second unit.   Miami and Indiana look like the deepest teams in the East to me. I agree that Morey will need to make a move for another ball handler by the deadline Kyle Lowry, Derrick Rose, Patty Mills, George Hill, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon come to mind as potential fits if they become available."
"Would the Grizzlies drafting Hasheem Thabeet at #2 when Harden, Rubio, Curry, DeRozan were all still on the board?  Even Danny Green at #46 and Patty Mills at #55 would have been better picks than Thabeet."
Yeah. Like a JJ Barera or Patty Mills  Those rock solid backup points are always in high demand
"Basketball reference’s model puts him at 0.06%, just below Spurs legend Patty Mills."
Gary Trent Jr's hair is too similar to Patty Mills'
If Patty Mills was named Trae Young he would've been shooting free throws there
This Patty Mills fella is a problem!!
"Kyrie isn't Aussie, he was just born in the country to American parents. We don't claim him at all. Patty Mills and Lauren Jackson are the Australian basketball GOATs."
"Watched the whole game and my takeaways:   (1) AD shooting 3s is just insane. A 30/10 Big with every move under the sun, great positioning, and has gravity both inside and outside?   (2) LeBron's 2nd gear is legendary. Man will slow and steady control the whole game, never falling too far behind, then will just close out the game with a 9-0 run to make the scoreboard look like it wasn't close.   (3) Lakers shooters need to keep the pressure on. You don't want to see Matthews taking only two 3s in a game. The man was running and affecting the game, it just looked like he wasn't getting his screens. Lebron was playing a bit too much free safety to be honest, saw too many 5 on 4 plays by the Spurs in transition they gobbled up freebie layups with 15+ seconds on the shot clock.   (4) THT is something else, plays insanely confident for a 2nd year player. Loved his spin move highlight, I think in game where LeBron turns it on a little earlier, THT could be trusted to hold a lead with the bench unit and play 20mins.   (5) Kuzma was a dog for sure this game, the missed 3s nearly all looked good and in the context of the play. If he was 6-11 from the field and 2-4 from 3 I think he'd get a lot more positive press from this game.   His late putback on LeBron's layup definitely altered the mental side of the game. The Lakers defense was revitalized for the final stretch off that move. His foul trouble was insane, at least 2 of those could easily have been play-ons, but whatever it happens.   (6) Gasol was uncharacteristically quiet, I really wouldn't have thought the box score would say 8 rebounds, 3assists, 2 blocks. I feel like I remember it as 5/1/1. Just wasn't hearing his number called I guess.   (7) Harrell had some good moves, but eye-test, I felt like he was a walking turnover this game. Shocked he only had 2. It felt like every pass he made was poorly angled or too hard. He was alive on boards though, can't take that away from him.   This Lakers team will just destroy with rebounds.   Spurs side, they played like the Borg. I never feel like any 1 player is trying to show off much.   (1) They just seemed to return every 3 with their own 3, and in transition would just casually hit the layup with 18 seconds left on the clock. They were a machine. I think the minutes spread shows this philosophy a bit.  (2) Rudy Gay felt silent for me until his big block in the 4th. He needs to get to the FT line more. I like him but he needs to force the issue and get his 20 pts. It's important to the team.   (3) DeRozan was just a monster. No turnovers, everything felt like it went in. I think he undershot as part of the system, but Patty Mills felt like the #2 on that team last night and that's just weird. Felt like I wasn't seeing Murray and DeRozan overlapping correctly. Like they'd both be on the court but they were side by side, not together.   (4) Johnson put on a clinic, no other way to say it. I didn't even realize he made 9 attempts, it felt like he went 5 for 5. He had a jigglypuff sing effect on the Lakers for real. Although he was -12, it felt like the Lakers just couldn't stay awake within 5 feet of him. 2 steals, 1 block, 10 rebounds, 9 looks from 3. A man on an island for sure. Spurs fans, is he always this good? I feel like he wasn't on my radar correctly.     (5) Murray can't be this quiet. I really could have believed he was DNP-Coach Decision this game. He needs to get to the line.   (6) I think the Spurs kind of just coincidentally didn't get to the line much because they were destroying so well in transition that they weren't even getting enough defense pressure to cause a foul.   At times though, it felt like they were taking heat checks 3s way too early on the clock. Like they would destroy in transition, or hit a massive open 3, but got heavily dissuaded from trying the paint against a set defense. I think this was mostly an Anthony Davis, would really like to see this team with Aldridge available in the playoffs. They play the game very well visually."
Patty Mills is on the Spurs
FUCK YES!!!!!!  AND WE CAN STILL ADD WESTBROOK or LOWRY   AND PATTY MILLS  LETS GOOOOO
Patty Mills and Derrick White have both been taking off the dribble 3s regularly. I think it's clear they want Lonnie taking more 3s too but he doesn't have much confidence.
"Patty mills is a woman though. They announced it at the opening ceremony. Patty can play Woman's basketball, though.."
"Holiday is top 3, right behind Patty Mills and Evan Fournier."
If he's a Top 10 player so is Patty Mills on his respective Australian team
Holy shit you’re ignorant. You’re right Patty Mills is Dame level.
Patty Mills is not allowed seeing as she's playing in the female division. Checkmate.
"I’ve posted it before to a similar comment but it bears repeating I think:  While I’m a massive patty mills fan and I agree that he’s a big reason for our recent success in basketball tournaments, let’s not forget that from the late 80s to 2000, Australia had some very strong teams led by Andrew Gaze and we placed 4th at the Olympics in 88, 96, 2000(and 6th in 92). We didn’t do so well after that until the last few years, but Australia has been a force on the worldwide stage a lot longer than that  On that note, let’s bring it home Boomers!"
it really really hasn’t   blows my mind you guys think Patty Mills is beating or even competing with Lebron/Curry led USA
Patty Mills does not fuck about
Patty Mills absolutely balls the fuck out every time he plays for Australia. He levels up like a Pokémon
Patty Mills.
Well ya that's not fair the dingos have patty mills
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Patty Mills type role on a Spurs tier play-in tournament team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
"They need to get through Spain and Aussie too.... Spain might be doable, but the boomers though, Patty Mills and Thybulle gonna cook their asses"
"But it's still not USA vs. the ""rest of the world"" even if the top talent is spread across more continents. It doesn't matter if there's more top players from other countries when most countries best players still wouldn't make team USA.  If Jokic, Giannis, and Luka were on the same team no one would be surprised if they beat team USA. But guys like Evan Fournier and Patty Mills who are leading their countries to victories still wouldn't even make the USA roster"
I think your biggest disadvantage is a lack of Patty Mills.
"I like to think it does to an extent in certain situations  Role players and international players who step up: for example, Patty Mills will be remembered as someone who steps up in international competition (even more so if Boomers go deep this year).  In terms of Americans, I think there is a small boost to legacy if a player leads the USA to more than one major victory (Melo comes to mind as a committed USA star).  Plus there are random outlier years, those who were on the dream team, whilst having amazing nba careers, would definitely consider being a part of the dream team as an important moment in their career  That being said, fiba ball still doesn’t mean much to nba legacy compared to say, the World Cup, but as more nations inch closer to the US in terms of nba talent, it is slowly but surely growing."
Think we are scared of the USA? WE GOT PATTY FUXKING MILLS
"Yurrr, Patty Cake. PATTY MILLS IS LEADING US TO GOLD"

Patty mills for Australia makes prime Michael Jordan look like Kyle Kuzma 😤
Patty fucking 'Thrills' Mills!! I wouldn't be surprised if the guy bled green and gold considering what he always does when putting on that jersey.  How can any Australian not be proud with this guy as our flag carrier!
"As of this moment in regards to performance. Patty Mills, in his FIBA element right now, am Australian tho this is not at all biased"

This entire thread is just loving patty mills and I am here for it
Did you hear about the new Nicolas Cage film? National Treasure 3.  He tries to steal Patty Mills
I don’t mean to overreact but I think we should knight Patty Mills and elect him prime minister

Patty Mills is so good at shooting that the government took our guns away. He is all we need.
"Patty Mills and the Olympics, name a better duo hahaha"
its almost like patty mills shooting from 3 is a better option than getting blocked under the rim
Patty Mills is clearly the greatest basketball player of all time.   How many points have Wilt Chamberlain or Michael Jordan scored at this Olympics?
"olympics patty ""michael jordan""  mills lmao"
Patty Mills is playing like old school DWade. Dude is everywhere doing everything

patty fookin' mills
"International basketball shits all over NBA don't @ me.  Where else can you see Patty mills tear shit up, the opposition get Jingled and Exum and Sobey go off. Plus when we play the Philippines it becomes a cage Match MMA event. Where is my boy Thon Maker, the maker of widows?"

Fred VanVleet or Patty Mills
"F it, it’s qtr to 1, I’m drunk and my alarm is set for 4:55am to watch our game.  I’m staying up to watch Dellevedova and Patty Mills make St. Mary’s proud.  Dipping back into the bag of treats now I guess.  I’m all in only because I love Mills, Dellevedova, Longley, and my man Bogut.  Is Exum on the team?"
The goat Patty Mills
FIBA patty mills
Patty Mills and TJ Mcconell is the only MLE that comes to mind
"&gt;Its such a weak free agency   Not when it comes to point guards it's not, especially ones who are at least on Schroder's level. There's only a few teams that have $20 million in cap space to make him a lucrative offer, and Schroder will be competing for that money with Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, and Patty Mills. Hell, if some team with a lot of space wanted to they could very easily trade for Kemba Walker and get a better PG than Schroder. If Schroder was hands down the best PG available, then sure, one team might throw a ton of money at him just as BPA, but that's clearly not the case this year."
"That's true, but considering all the other point guards who will be free agents this summer, I find it highly unlikely some team thinks Dennis Schroder is the best of them. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (who could be easily had if you have the cap space to absorb his contract in a trade) are all probably more desirable options or worth more money than Dennis Schroder is. I think the odds someone makes Schroder a $100 million offer this summer is practically nil."
"I don’t think we’ll get like a huge buyout guy or anything, but it might make some other players who want to redeem their value like Bobby Portis look at us, or guys who might not be the “right” guy for a team like Brooklyn.  I can see us going after Patty Mills with the Bud connection.  Oladipo worked out with Giannis last year and needs a place to try and rebuild his value.  There will be other guys who aren’t big names who might get a boost from playing next to Giannis.  We aren’t going to get another All-Star or anything, but it’ll make us much more attractive to role players looking to up their value."
"Patty Mills, Melo, Redick, McDermott, Green just to name a few. These are all high volume shooters and good efficiency, some better than others. Also just to add  they would still have their taxpayer MLE to spend after trading for Westbrook."
"Luka Doncic gold, Patty Mills silver, thank you"
I'm not turning my back on my country for Patty freakin Mills
"Boomers are one of my favourite teams and that is mostly because of Patty Mills. When Patty Mills was playing for the Blazers and a lot of fans complained about him and said he'd be out the league soon I couldn't believe that was the same Patty Mills who was so important for the Boomers. Now that Serbia (another national team I root for) isn't playing it's high time they win at least a bronze (was convinced they'd win the World Cup last time, but then they faltered."
"We rock with the Aussies regardless. Obviously we want the US to win gold, but Patty Mills a monster and Joe Ingles a meme legend over here. Hopefully we’ll both be up on that podium together."
"Defensively, he put on a masterclass. Bud has three major issues going into this season:  1. Wouldn’t play his players major minutes, and would play end-of-the-bench players in the playoffs l 2. Wouldn’t adjust game-to-game 3. Wouldn’t adjust in-game  To his credit, he seemed to overcome the first two and he progressed a bit on No. 3. As a matter of fact, the over adjusted some times in-game.  Furthermore, he put in a defensive masterclass. He did have two All-NBA defenders in Jrue and BroLo, and the DPOY to throw at teams, as well as PJ Tucker.  Finally, the Bucks need a PG. Jrue’s passing is great, but if the Bucks had a true PG (please get Patty Mills!), a lot of the half-court issues would be amended."

Patty Mills
"Patty Mills is both the first Torres Strait Islander (through his father) and the first Aboriginal (through his mother, who was taken from her family as part of the Stolen Generations) to be flag bearer for Australia. Kind of crazy it's taken this long considering the impact Indigenous Australians have had on Australian sports, and the nation as a whole, although I think Cathy Freeman was offered and declined."
So much great Aussie content haha  Dunlop Volleys  Joe Ingles not giving high-fives to certain guys  Players singing to [Slim Dusty](https://youtu.be/hOML9zwoZn0)  Patty fuckin Mills  and of course bulk shit-talking
Everybody knows Patty Mills though
Some kid just tuning into basketball for the first time is going to think Patty Mills is the greatest point guard of all time. And that makes me really happy
FIBA Patty Mills is a God
Patty Mills is ridiculously good at olympics basketball
"Great win tonight; the Boomers have historically underachieved but have barely put a foot wrong in Tokyo and have given themselves an opportunity to secure their first international medal.   The defensive effort against Argentina was immense.  Matisse Thybulle has been brilliant to date, an absolute defensive menace.  Loved Patty Mills as usual, what a leader he has been in Tokyo."
It is when you have Patty Mills!!!!
FIBA Ricky Rubio second to FIBA Patty Mills.
"Look, I'm as straight as a line, but Patty Mills is so fucking hot 😍. His muscles are as big as a beast, his body movements are so smooth and sexy, and that face of his is j-j-just... beautiful. I mean, look at his hair, it's growing back. Not only that, but his beard is just beautiful. His face, looking so happy. His eyes, so full of life. Just hearing his voice gets me hard. I just want him to bring back that sexy headband.  And let's not forget he's a GOAT. Wanna see what I mean? Just look at him compared to MJ. He isn't a skinny, aneroxic looking dude. He's strong and big, just like a train. He can grow facial hair unlike MJ. He also helps kids and spends money on kids, unlike MJ (gambling).  I just love Patty. I would turn gay for him in a heartbeat. He's got the money, he's got the looks, and most of all, he's got the good personality. He never got involved in scandals, and knows how to raise a proper family.  Patty, if you're reading this you're awesome. Please talk to me. I worship you every single night. &lt;3"
Patty Mills wouldn't have botched a vaccine rollout
It’s more like :  1. FIBA Patty Mills 2. FIBA Luka Dončić 3. FIBA Evan Fournier 4. This Michael Jordan guy
Patty Mills post game huddle - We haven't done fucking shit yet
THYBULLE IS A BEAST  PATTY MILLS IS A BEAST  THAT IS ALL  BRING ON USA
Greatest basketball players of all-time:  1.Patty Mills 2.this Michael Jordan guy
Patty Mills is the only PM we need
"A nice 4th quarter shellacking so far...  Mills &gt; Landale no look, just beautiful.  I think Boomer-Patty might just be the most unguardable player in the games so far"
I need to buy a Patty Mills boomers jersey already. Especially as the flag bearer this year.
"I’m hoping we can get Patty Mills, Danny Green, or Kelly Oubre, Gay, and hell why not Reggie Jackson.   We’ll do a sign and trade for shroeder and Drummond to to any team for pocket lint or chewing gum haha"
I hope the Bucks sign either Patty Mills or Dante Exum. Or both. Both would be excellent.
"I mean im slightly worried about FIBA Patty Mills, also if USA has a weakness in their team it is the bigs mainly the 5."
Everyone talks about Jordan’s rings but now they know about olympics patty mills
Michael Jordan is just a shit Patty Mills
"Born too late to explore the earth, born too early to explore the galaxy, born just in time to witness FIBA Patty Mills."

PATTY MILLS
bro when did patty mills become prime steve nash
Lol wtf is this shit?? Do you not know of Patty Mills?
Patty Mills could tho
"I'm not gay, but Patty Mills is Patty Mills"
Patty Mills for PM.
More Patty Mills please.
who is patty mills? 🙄🤔🤫😰  in math: my solution ➗😊  in history: my king 👑😣  in art: my canvas 🎨🥳  in science: my oxygen 💨😝  in geography: my world 🌎🤯  in sport: my goat 🐐
can this rag tag group of nobodies defeat FIBA superstar Patty Mills?
"I don't think the Warriors won or loss, only guy they missed out on so far is Batum. There's still guys like Patty Mills that we are looking at."
The Hield trade is just such a long shot. I don’t think Schroeder or the Kings want to do the Lakers any favors.  You are expecting one of Patty Mills or Rudy Gay to take a vet min when there are teams offering them the MLE at least?  You might get DeMar for the MLE. That one is actually reasonable.
"Bruh why would Jeanie want to fork out 40-50m out of her own pocket on a backup PG role player? If it was a star, I get it but Lakers can sign Patty Mills who is better for the MLE"
One Danny Green and/or Patty Mills for me please.
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left
Olympic Patty Mills   But I'd take Rubio from the two
"Why do people insist on proclaiming the Lakers a finished product when most of their big free agency moves still have yet to be decided on? Maybe this is the finished roster or maybe by this time tomorrow they have Buddy Hield, Rudy Gay, Patty Mills and THT added to the team, or maybe DeRozan signs for the MLE. It's literally a huge incomplete for much of their roster right now.   We should at the very least wait until 24 hours into free agency have passed before making judgements about teams. Things are going to change wildly for a lot of teams tomorrow and over the next week. Free agency didn't end when everyone went to bed on the first day.  This would be like saying the Clippers look awful because right now Kawhi and Reggie Jackson are gone. Let's wait and see what happens before passing judgment on anyone."
"&gt;I’m just saying they already made the choice to let Caruso walk, saving ~$40 million in luxury tax  You're assuming that move means no more money for anyone, when there's no way to infer that. It's equally possible the Lakers feel extremely confident that they're getting guys at the guard spots who would eat up most of Caruso's minutes and thus didn't want to sink a bunch of money into like the 10th or 11th man.   If they *do* have a Hield trade lined up and are just ironing out the particulars and are far along in talks with Patty Mills *and* believe THT is going to make a big leap then they may have figured there really wasn't a spot in the rotation for Caruso. To just immediately decide that move means the Lakers are cheaping out after just adding Westbrook is extremely premature. Let's wait till the full roster is in place before passing judgment on the motivation behind that move."
Trae Young is Olympic Patty Mills but all the time
l o fucking l  patty mills and ricky rubio are role players in the nba because that's as good as their skill level dictates  the rules have nothing to do with it  good lord you fiba purists have gone absolutely insane these past few weeks
Where is patty mills going?
FIBA Patty Mills FIBA Ricky Rubio FIBA Luka Doncic FIBA Evan Fournier FIBA Luis Scola  I don't think anyone's beating this team smh
KD Warriors or Olympic Rubio/Patty Mills/Luka/Melo/Gobert
I want Australia now.   Holiday on Patty Mills
Ricky Rubio is not Patty Mills
"That's a really good point about guard defense. We've got a bunch of good wing defenders but really no one other than Jrue who can lock up quick point guards, Patty Mills is gonna eat us alive in the semis"
"USA beat Fiba God Rubio, but now they take on the boss (Patty Mills)"
"You beat one god, but can you beat another one in Patty Mills?"
"I’d love to see Patty Mills in a Lakers jersey, we’d just need to add a bit of greenery to it though"
Fiba Rubio is better than Fiba Patty Mills. This guy is a god.
"A Rubio and Patty Mills team would be unstoppable, 73 wins would not be safe"
Man if Spain pull this off there's a chance we get a battle between the FIBA GOATS Ricky Rubio and Patty Mills
Rubio is no Patty Mills.  He needs to be quicker and aggressive with his dribbling.
He's gotta get past Patty Mills first
would much rather sign patty mills…
"Sooooo melo, gay, and patty mills to round out the rest....right?  RIGHT??!"
"This is the exactly correct analysis. Oh btw, KCP’s role has already been replaced by Kent Bazemore and Trevor Ariza. They could still sign a patty mills or Rudy gay."
"Ricky ""Patty Mills"" Rubio"
international rubio = olympic patty mills &gt; mj
"FIBA Rubio vs FIBA Patty Mills, who you got?"
"brooklyn was favored few hours ago, not it all depends on patty mills and rudy gay"
Dont think so. Our MLE is probably going to Patty Mills

Y'all are in the hunt for Patty Mills
Boomer legend patty mills will finally teach Steph how to be half decent
"Haha if they can somehow get Buddy, I’ll eat my words. I don’t think there’s anyone left but I don’t mind Danny Green, Porter Jnr, Oubre, or Patty Mills. I would like those signings for the Lakers"
Top free agents still available     * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Richaun Holmes * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker
You think it rests on whether or not they get Patty Mills? lol
Well take a guy like Patty Mills or Iguodala. They’ve won their rings. Now a guy like Millsap…
"Sorry mod, missed a key.  Go boomers. Patty Mills deserves a medal."
"I like Patty Mills on the Lakers. He’s a leader and not afraid of big moments. He would be a big signing if we could get him. Just watch him on the Australian team with the Olympics, he’s killing it right now"
"Yeah, maybe to get Patty Mills on board."
"My prediction is that we will see a repeat of last year, unless they managed to defy expectations and grab Patty Mills. That said, even with him they'd desperately need a center."
"Well, the only reason I can guess is that his contract would have cost us ~$30-$40M total after luxury tax, and they think they can replace his production.  There’s rumors out there about Patty Mills potentially signing for the TPMLE, and Avery Bradley potentially for the veterans minimum, so that could be it. That said, it’s still dumb from an asset management perspective. It’s not like we couldn’t have flipped him mid-season for a pick or two if they wanted to save on the tax.."
Bucks dont have the MLE. They have the tax payer MLE which is considerably less and will certainly not be enough to sign Patty Mills.
I’d like 1 Patty Mills please.
"Yo just thank god we didn't pay him $15 mill for 2 years, the guy is nice and tough but WASHED as fuck. Bobby for just over half that plus the MLE on a real player (like maybe Patty Mills), thanks."
"Wow if the lakers don’t get patty mills or some nice shit to replace him this will be a weird failure on Pelinka, Lebron and everyone over there"
"They weren't going to stick LBJ w/ a ballhandler of Wright's stature. Westbrook is far from ideal, but he definitely takes a ton of pressure off Lebron, which at his age, he needs. Lakers are in salary hell anyways, if they somehow pull off some combination of Patty Mills, Otto Porter Jr, rudy gay Malik Monk, etc, this could work well, but right now I would bet this is going to be a mess. Lakers shouldve trusted what they had was enough w/ minor tweaks, injuries contributed more to their downfall than anything (w/ shooting probably 2nd &amp; they sure haven't addressed that yet)."
Should have paid Caruso the Caruso money sigh. Only way it makes sense to me is like if we know Patty Mills is on the way or something.
"they are. kleber preferred rehab and theis, i dont know, maybe also injury or free agency didnt want to risk an injury.  on the other hand you see patty mills playing for australia despite free agency."
"There aren’t any PG’s left that are worth the money though. Schroeder or Patty Mills are basically the only options worth more than a minimum.   If we wanted a PG, then we would have just paid Graham the 12 Million/year. We obviously want something else.   There’s been too much smoke around Holmes, and the Kings can’t match an offer over 4/50 easily. I’m not sure I like giving Holmes the money, but it seems like that’s the Front Offices goal right now."
I like pop but the idea of him being salty that a team he fucking hates and actively tries to fuck over (not trading kawhi which is perfectly fine but then reportedly telling the pelicans not to trade AD there) getting Patty Mills would be funny (to me)
Bro. Put some respect on Olympic goat Patty Mills name. He is the one making the decision who he wants to win the championship with.
"They prob already have an offer sheet for THT, and Patty mills might sign, gonna be crowded in the 1/2 position. If anything they play THT more mins now to increase his value to trade later in the season"
Patty mills
"We can’t force players to sign with our team. Also it literally says we’re one of the teams in on Patty Mills, the only one we’ve really missed out on so far is Batum"
There’s no way Nico deserves minutes over Patty Mills though
"Mannion, Mulder, Poole, Lee. We’ve got guys that can rotate in. I’m not saying it’s not a need to address, but compare that to SF and PF right now and it just seems we focus the MLE somewhere else over Mills. I’m not saying this would disappoint me at all - Patty is a baller - it just feels like a Twitter smoke screen to me."
Where in this tweet or anywhere on the internet are the Mavs rumored to even be going after Patty Mills?
Patty Mills would be so perfect for the Warriors
Please no patty mills to Lakers
"Patty mills to the bucks, my sources told me"
"Seems like Patty is gone unfortunately, judging by rumours that is, not that my Pels are doing any better. I'd have rather seen Mills re-sign and stay in San Antonio."
AD and Patty Mills
Rudy Gay and Patty Mills about to make the Nets Lakers finals even more spicy. Let’s see how they land between the two.
"Still waiting for positive news for GSW... My boss told me I was anxious as my face is currently pale now. Not getting my hopes high but if Bobby signs and was underpaid, I still believe we can get Patty Mills! Hahahaha"
"There is little to zero chance of Hield, frankly the Lakers don't have the salaries to match or anything the Kings would want. Ellington is your Hield facsimile. If Patty Mills gets to you guys I wouldn't be massively shocked but that would be the mid-level gone. Everything else will be vet mins"
I would rather have ingles and then try to sign patty mills to a vet min this offseason
"We have a Patty Mills mural in our new court. Frankly I wouldn’t be surprised if going forward there is more attention on the aussie basketballers now. You have to remember, there aren’t many stores including direct Nike outlets etc who will carry it, so the stock isn’t even being manufactured in the first place.  All my Tisse jerseys were personalised jerseys I put his name and number on, outside his college one. That means there are no mass produced ones whatsoever."
They just did in Patty Mills
Thanks!  I hope one day people like you will be able to actually understand basketball and not think a team led by Patty Mills would be a quality NBA team!
I mean I don’t agree with what they’re saying about Popp but that part about international teams &lt; NBA teams is just true. Guys like patty mills have to be stars for their international team whereas in the NBA they end up capping out as role players
Patty Mills started playing for the Boomers in 2007 and Joe Ingles started in 2008... They've been in this for the long haul and this is their first Olympic medal. Awesome
"If you missed early 2010s patty mills towel waving bench shenanigans, you may have missed the best era of NBA basketball. I fucking love this guy."
Patty Mills carrying australia with 42 points 🐐
Patty Mills I love this man so much
"I mean, it’s the truth.  What teams do you actually think would be able to compete for anything other than last place in the NBA?  The three semi final teams after USA are have what?  Like two or three NBA talent guys?   You think a teams who’s two best players are Patty Mills and Ben Simmons is going to do anything?  Lol."
"Give gaze his credit when talking about the best ever for Aussie Basketball too mate, this does make patty Mills the most successful, but gaze has bled green and gold for 30 years now"
PATTY FUCKING MILLS
Damn. Hell of a game by patty Mills
"Patty Mills had the best view at this dunk, it was surely amazing."
"Brooklyn needs to change their colors to green and gold ASAP. Then they'll have 4 superstars on their team: KD, Harden, Kyrie and Patty fucking Mills."
"That is ridiculous! He was obviously carried by Patty Mills (seriously, it was lovely to see the two of them hug and congratulate one another after the medal ceremony)"
"Slovenia had no business of winning this. The constant whining did them in, imo. I'm also not a fan of naturalizing players but it is within FIBA rules so whatever.   Australia on the other hand were concentrated the whole game through. Especially Patty Mills. Well deserved medal."
Patty Mills is going straight to the pool room. Too deadly brother!
"The Nets are getting *this* Patty Mills to be their 2nd/3rd PG? With Kyrie, Harden, and KD still on the team? Oh dear."
"Prime Minister Sir Patty Mills OAM or something I dunno, just give him a burger with the lot"
Patty Mills Patty Mills  Im the scoring man  I get these buckets as fast as I can   ... Someone else go on I dont remember the lyrics lmao
serious question why does patty mills turn into an all star at every FIBA game
&gt;patty mills on the nets  still feels wrong to say it 😭 take care!!!
42 thank you very much!  Patty Mills is literally the answer to life the universe and everything
"As much as I wanted Luka to win, it’s hard not to be happy for Patty Mills. Amazing performance."
Patty Mills father of Slovenia
Damn Patty Mills is really like Australian Australian lol I was not expecting him to talk like that
Fiba Patty mills &gt; Jordan
Undisputed Top 5 GOAT List   1. International Competition Patty Mills    2. Hoodie Melo   3. Michael Jordan   4. Kevin Durant’s Burner Account   5. Luka “Bird Magic” Doncic
haha exactly - Mills mentioned the portal in a presser very recently didn't he?  is that a ''thing'' or did Patty just come out with some weird Donnie Darko shit - if its the latter then it's an artful way of describing his mindset.
Patty Mills new role as number one offensive option on the Nets gives him a good chance
is Patty Mills is better than Luka Donharden?
"He will also play with Bronze medalist Patty ""Jordan"" Mills this year so he's not moving anytime soon"
Luka's in tears cause FIBA just gave Patty Mills 40 points...
"I want to see some more patty mills statues around australia now, he deserves it"
I never been closer to being gay than when I watch Patty Mills ball out for my country.
"He missed some easy 3s too, coulda had 50 piece. patty effin mills. the legend"
"What context does this provide? Do you even know what those words mean.   Fuck outta here, this is a Patty Mills thread. Go make a 6th place Ricky Rubio thread if you wanna post this shit"
"Imagine being snide at someone being excited at winning bronze at the fucking Olympics. But then again, Patty Mills has achieved more in the past week than the OP has and will achieve in. Their whole life. So it’s understandable that their a little bitter."
"Patty Mills so humble, he don't want to destroy all the other nba teams so he is just chilling on the bench"
"That patty mills post match speech was iconic. “Gonna bring an Olympic medal back home to my country, I’ll hang it at mum and dads house”."
"Even if they didn't medal, Patty being the flag bearer made me proud as hell! The guy bleeds Gold and Green and has the strength to also show the aboriginal and Torres straight islander flag too. Him bringing in bronze on all of his performance, every Aussie should be ridiculously proud. Patty fuckimg thrills Mills!!"
Patty “FIBA” Mills for the MVP of the tournament.
fucking legend patty mills.    absolute gun!.    WE DID IT! WE FINALLY FUCKING DID IT !
"A Bronze medal at the Olympics might not seem like such a mighty achievement, but the Australian Men's Basketball team have historically been unlucky and/or choked - 4 times we have played off in a Bronze medal deciding match previously and we lost 'em all.  So finally Australian Basketball has done something tangible on the world stage. This squad at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics have achieved something that Australian basketball legends like Andrew Gaze and Shane Heal never quite managed.  Patty Mills leadership was superb all tournament and he was not leaving the building tonight without the W and a medal around his neck."
Patty Mills delivering the best post match interview of the Olympics here
Patty Mills for PM. He'll have us vaccinated in no time.
"According to this sub he is the most hated person in the world almost. Don't get me wrong, most of the people I know are not happy about him pulling out, but we're far more proud of the players that gave it their all rather than think about someone who didn't play. These dudes got bronze and on the back of the best Aussie athlete there is in Patty Mills. That's all that matters. Simmo still has time to prove himself, and as much as this sub loves giving him shit he's still an Aussie that is incredibly talented no matter how much people want to shit talk him"
I’m so happy that Australia finally got a medal and Patty Mills gets rewarded on the international stage for all he has done for his country on the world stage.  I have faith that we’ll be back and this will teach Luka the importance of being in control of your emotions when things don’t go your way so that he can become an even better player. It wasn’t the result we wanted but I’m still very proud of how far we came!
put patty mills on currency cunt
"Luka acted like a bitch this whole game instead of being the leader of the team he was his previous games. Pulling up random threes without any ball movement, bunch of turnovers. Seems like he was really tired both physically and emotionally.   Patty Mills on the other hand, exceptional performance, what an all-around game for Australia's leader. Well deserved. Congratulations to Australia on their first Olympic basketball medal!"
Emma McKeon and Patty Mills for closing ceremony flag bearers!!
Patty Mills GOATED.
"Move over Gazey, Patty Mills is now our greatest ever Boomer"
Holy shit that just got me so hyped for both Australia as well as the thought of having patty mills on the nets.   I’m definitely rooting for the boomers from here on out
Incredibly proud to be an Aussie basketball fan right now... We've waited a long time for our moment. Patty Mills can have my babies
Patty Mills was just unstoppable. Slovenia had a lot of really bad turnovers on top of that. Congrats Aussies!
"Congrats to Australia. Been following olympics since 1992. Always great matches vs my Lithuania. Yall deserve this medal, always came up short. Yall ball powerhouse. From Andrew Gaze, Luc Longley, Shane H, to Patty Mills."
PATTY MILLS TAKE A BOW YOU CARRIED US TO OUR FIRST EVER MEDAL.
He’s more worried about being a Kardashian then a basketball player. All the love for Patty Mills. What a moment for Australian basketball.
"Thank you Patty Mills and the Boomers.  Dante, Joe, Matisse, Jock, etc. played hard and smart down the stretch.  So proud of all of these guys and the hard work, blood, sweat,  and tears over the past 20+ years to get us to this point. Lots of people behind the scenes deserve this moment.   Tears of joy from my hospital bed.  GG Slovenia. Luca will get his next time."
"Patty Mills, Olympic Medalist.   I couldn’t be any prouder to be Australian in this moment. He just cemented himself as an Australian icon.  First Indigenous man to be flag bearer, first placing for the Boomers internationally. 42 fucking points. I can’t be more prouder for him."
"Exum, Jingles, Matisse and Patty fucken Mills were HUGE, so happy for Patty to have the game of his life in the most important game in his country's history"
"As an Australian this means so fucking much to see not only Australian basketball win a medal but Patty fucking Mills, he is a perfect ambassador for the best of Australia and I can’t be more happy for him. FUCK YEAH PATTY YOU FUCKING LEGEND GO BOOMERS"
"What a great way to start this future season for Patty Mills, man snatching a medal in the olympic and he will have a huge role on the Nets. I'm really glad for Fiba Patty deserves this medal, and that Thybulle guy BOOMED ME."
So proud of our boys. Finally a medal after finishing 4th for the last 4 Olympics. Patty Mills carried us. What a true champion.
Patty fucking Mills. His HoF chances looking better 👀
Patty mills come up from the bench for kyrie omegalul

Patty Mills put us on his back and carried us to this. What a legend.
PATTY MILLS IS AN AUSTRALIAN ICON 🇦🇺💪🦘❤️
Matisse Thybulle put an absolute exclamation mark on the show with the dunk at the end there. And Patty Mills take a bow lad that was a cracking performance
Down by 3. Let’s go ahead and get unsportment like foul by pretending to raise my hands up and “accidentally” push patty mills. To show your presence??
"Luka acted like a bitch this whole game instead of being the leader of the team he was his previous games. Pulling up random threes without any ball movement, bunch of turnovers. Seems like he was really tired both physically and emotionally.   Patty Mills on the other hand, exceptional performance, what an all-around game for Australia's leader. Well deserved. Congratulations to Australia on their first Olympic basketball medal!"
Olympic Patty Mills is a different beast.
What better way to cap of the medal game from AUS than to have an amazing Patty Mills game.
"Patty Mills, the true Australian PM"
"Patty fucking Mills, ladies and gentlemen. So happy for him and the Boomers!"
Patty Mills was just unstoppable. Large amount of unforced errors or even turnovers by Slovenia. Congrats Aussies!

So proud of this team and they are so damn likeable. Patty Mills an an absolute hero and deserves every bit of praise he gets. So pleased!
"Patty Motherfucking Mills defines the heart of a champion. Blood sweat and tears dedicated to his country, the best Australian basketball by a fucking light year. Patty mother fucking Mills."
He better be Patty Mills OAM come next Australia Day
No gonna lie there’s a reason guys like Mills and Rubio go off in Fiba/Olympic games the level of defense isn’t anywhere near the nba. Patty Mills still has the occasional good game but the majority of the time he can’t stay on the court more than 20 mins due to a combo of effectiveness and defense.
Patty Mills for Australian of the Year.
"GIVE THYBULLE THE KEYS TO AUSTRALIA, PATTY FUCKING MILLS IS THE GREATEST AUSTRALIAN TO EVER LIVE!!"
Flag bearer and Prime Minister Patty Mills ends up with the ball as we finally win our first basketball medal. Perfectly scripted

"casually bringing Patty Mills, Paul Millsap and Lamarcus Aldridge off the bench is kinda wild"
I was like who is that little girl on the court and it turns out it’s Patty Mills 😂
"Ben failed to perform against the Hawks when it was needed and in a spectacular fashion.   Asks for a trade which the Sixers initially agreed to do. Sixers found out that would be difficult with his value at an all-time low and asked him to come back to the team.   Ben refuses to return and demands a trade. Sixers hold fast as there’s no option out there that’s a good value in return. Ben misses training camp and pre-season games, misses out on a payday in doing so.  Ben returns to market disgruntled. Shows no effort in practice. When asked to join in today refused multiple times and then is asked to go home and suspended a game plus fines.  If reports are to be believed he went to a strip club after being sent out of practice.  Bonus: Ben refused to go to the olympics and says he will be working on his game during the off-season instead. Ben is pictured watching Wimbledon while international camps are on, but we do eventually get the customary Ben shooting 3’a in an empty gym video. The Aussie Boomers eventually medal for the first time at the Olympics, which likely cements Patty Mills as one of the greatest, if not the greatest Aussie basketball player of all time"
"And I don’t believe that. Harden and KD aren’t playing 40+ minutes in the regular season. Patty mills is a scoring guard. Who’s going to run the offense when Harden sits? I don’t trust old LMA and Milsap as their front court back ups they also have 0 wing/guard defense. As a regular season team, they’re not number one"
"Hey Niku, it looks like I’m the spurs section Patty mills has the wrong logo for his FA signing. He signed with the nets but the logo is still spurs"
"Thanks for doing tiers, way better. I'll do it too.   (Assuming Kyrie won't play, Kawhi and Murray are back to normal come playoffs)  (Tier 1-3 are in order inside the tiers, 4 is lightly ordered and 5 is just a list as it's meaningless.)  &amp;#x200B;  ***Team Power Rankings:***  ***Tier 1: Favourites***  Nets, Bucks, Lakers  &amp;#x200B;  ***Tier 2: Top Contenders***  Clippers, Suns, Nuggets, Heat, Warriors, Hawks  &amp;#x200B;  ***Tier 3: Strong Playoff Teams***  Jazz, Celtics, Sixers, Blazers, Bulls, Mavs, Knicks  &amp;#x200B;  ***Tier 4: Low Tier Potential Playoff Teams***  Wolves, Pelicans, Wizards, Spurs, Kings, Pacers, Hornets  &amp;#x200B;  ***Tier 5: Tanking Teams***  Rockets, Thunder, Magic, Pistons, Raptors, Cavs  &amp;#x200B;  ***MVP:*** Steph Curry      *Finalists:*   Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic        ***DPOY:*** Giannis Antetokounmpo      *Finalists:*   Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert        ***ROTY:*** Cade Cunningham      *Finalists:*   Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes        ***6th Man:*** Tyler Herro      *Finalists:*   Kevin Huerter      Patty Mills        ***Most Improved:*** Jordan Poole      *Finalists:*   OG Anunoby      Kevin Porter Jr        ***COTY:*** Steve Kerr      *Finalists:*   Monty Williams      Mike Malone"
Cam Thomas and Patty Mills finalists for 6moy. Lmao
"&gt; Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  I don't see anything that makes Shamet better than Bullock.   How is he making more than 3x as much as Nic Batum (also not a rookie contract)? How is he making almost double what Patty Mills got (also not a rookie)?   Bryn Forbes was 4th in the entire NBA in 3pt% (45.2%) - better than Shamet has ever shot, including college - and signed for less than half of Shamet's amount (Forbes also isn't on a rookie deal).   Nothing against Waluigi, he got his money and good for him. But value-wise it makes zero sense to overpay for Shamet, who hasn't even shown he can be productive in PHX yet, while penny-pinching on far more valuable players who helped PHX win the West."
"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
"Not sure why you got downvoted. Lowry, at this point in his career, makes as much of an impact as Patty Mills"
Adding patty mills and Paul millsap is huge
"Also Jrue, Danny Green, Patty Mills, Patrick Beverly, Taj Gibson, Jennings, Rubio and a ton of other great role players"
"Lmao they have fucking Harden and KD. Imagine if Kyrie never existed for a moment, and there was a team with KD and harden, oh and throw in Patty Mills. People would be losing their shit."
"Patty Mills, Mikal Bridges, Iggy?"
"I think people have viewed him as ""good"" for a few years. at least in a patty Mills type of role."
Not a Spurs fan but you gotta pay your respects. A true mastermind of the game. The thing I appreciate the most about pop is his ability to get the most out of anyone. This dude had Boris and Patty mills looking like all stars in the playoffs.
Kyrie wouldn't even show up. Patty mills is showing up
And the biggest free agent move of the offseason - former Melbourne Tigers star Patty Mills
"Good for him. I never would have thought that KD could carry bums like tatum,dame, and dbook over monsters like patty mills."
"Plus all the assists he'll get from passing to KD, Joe Harris, and Patty Mills on the perimeter. Gonna be a lot of W's in fantasy lol"
"For real. We have:   Kevin Durant, James harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Lamarcus Aldridge, and Paul Millsap. That’s insane already"
"I’m pretty sure OKC has the most  Wiggins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Barton, Lou Will, Patty Mills, Fournier, JJ Barea  Also the entire Magic team for some reason"
"Kyrie absolutely balled out in an NBA finals series, hit a game winning shot in game 7 of the finals, but doesn't have a knack for winning? He is way too efficient to be labelled a chucker, and is a far superior player to Patty Mills"
Yeah people don't realize that without Dinwiddie we were extra fucked after losing both Harden and Kyrie. Patty Mills is huge
Patty Mills? Defense?
"Patty Mills all of a sudden waltzed into a starting role on a championship favorite. With KD and Harden good for 50-60 points a game, he can defend, take a smidge of pressure off harden being so ball dominant, and defend well."
Do people on this sub really think Patty Mills is better than Kyrie  This is hilarious
"Kevin love was all nba and Kyrie was an all star the season before Lebron came back to the cavs. Without Kyrie, Who’s the third best player on the Nets that was all nba/all star? Blake Griffin? Lamarcus Aldridge? Patty mills? Joe Harris? Lol  Duos are not superteams. KD/Harden and good role players is an even playing field with Kawhi/PG or Lebron/AD without Westbrook."
Patty Mills always and forever
I wouldn’t want Kyrie to rep Team USA. Patty Mills is also elite in International play.
Patty Mills has been amazing bench guy for about 8 years bro.
It’s hard winning an MVP when you got stars like James Harden and Patty Mills on the team
Patty Mills nominated for Aussie of the year then comes out and does this... Have Brooklyn considered adding a green and gold jersey to there collection?
I’ve been saying feed Patty Mills for years.
"After Duncan left i think they had 2 60 win seasons lol. And if you think Duncan was the reason they were so good from 2011 to 2017...well i hope you have Duncan in your top 5 lol   I guess it was Duncan who found Manu/Tony/Tiago/Blair/Patty Mills/Danny Green/Gary Neal, turned George Hill into Kawhi and Davis Bertans, Aaron Baynes, etc. etc."
He's no Patty Mills but I'm sure he'll make it one day in this tough league
We love us Olympics Patty Mills
Does patty mills game translate to the playoffs?
Patty mills has been the steal of the off-season for the nets
"Score makes it look like  blow oit but OKC never went away for most of them game, unfortunately the Nets have Kevin Wayne Durant and Patty ""the lost Curry brother"" Mills  Aldridge lowkey regressing lol, no ways he could keep up that shooting"
"It’s amazing watching KD play. I’m trying to enjoy it while it’s here. It’s truly some exceptional efficiency, and today wasn’t even particularly that good.   Also patty mills is a beast"
Patty just grinding OKC into flour.   That's why they call him Mills.
Who needs Kyrie when you got Patty Mills
OKC fans know that LMA and Patty Mills are certified Thunder killers.
Patty Mills saw Josh Giddey on the Thunder and thought it was the Olympics.
"Patty ""Steph Curry"" Mills"
Patty Mills &gt; Steph Curry 🤷🏾‍♂️
Where would the Nets be without their 2nd best player Patty Mills?
"Patty Mills looks like a ""generous"" 6'1""."
PATTY MILLS
patty mills owns irving
"&gt; Edwards isn't quite there yet in terms of efficiency  could be improved with a coach who's known to use talents efficiently   &gt;Beasley is just a chucker   Patty mills was just an end of bench guy, then becmae a really good 6th man  i think the talent is there, there just sdoesn't seem to be a system"
"well that's kinda my point, I think Pop would fix the attitude problems, probably have a few vets in there to establish a good culture and probably have a system in place to take advantage of their strenghts/weaknesses  like D-Lo does have talent, he showed it in brooklyn he put up 22/7 as 22 year old but has regressed probably due to bad coaching/situations  my point with Pop is that he actually improves players. he took Patty Mills and made him a solid 6th man. takes a lot of guys as late 1st round picks and makes them into rotation players (keldon johsnon, derrick white, dejounte, george hill, dejuan blair, tiago splitter)"
FIBA Patty Mills and FIBA Rick Rubio
Patty Mills  Bruce Brown  DeAndre Bembry  Paul Millsap  Lamarcus Aldridge
"Yeah I guess I only mentioned teams in the west.  But you are right. The Nets in the East will challenge them at least. If Kyrie comes back, than it's gonna be an actual battle going all the way, and it's a coin flip.   But the problem with the Nets is their bad defense, and lack of depth without Kyrie. Patty Mills and Blake Griffin will do well in the playoffs, but not much outside of that. Joe Harris vanished last time."
"Team USA also got cooked by Evan Fournier and Ricky Rubio in the Olympics, and other guards like Nando De Colo, Patty Mills, and Tomas Satorasky played reasonably well against them too. Was Jrue really stopping them?"
"Patty Mills, Jevon Carter, DeAndre Bembry, Paul Millsap and LaMarcus Aldridge.. pretty bad. Usually LMA is carrying that unit but he was off tonight."
"Harden still draws the attention of a top 10 player and they have Joe Harris, Patty Mills, LMA balling, Griffin, Millsap, Bruce Brown, and Claxton.  Idk, I just think that's better than the Warriors."
"they do, but they're never going to play meaningful minutes without KD or Harden anyway so they should be learning to play complementary minutes around our heliocentric stars rather than trying to watch Patty Mills ram his head against concrete for a few minutes"
"They're taking the piss, It's a reference to the Canadian Olympic commentator calling Patty Mills a woman"
"Completely agreed. In hindsight though, not only am I not disappointed that he withdrew from the Boomers (again), but actually glad he did. All the players on the Bronze medal team wanted to be there, wanted to finally break the drought and compete wearing the green and gold. I'll take Patty Mills and his heart, competitive drive, and shooting over Ben Simmons' waning star power any day."
"My two least favourite Australians atm are Scomo and Ben Simmons, in that order. Both are letting us down. Patty Mills on the other hand, absolute hero."
This can't be good for Ben's mental health... How will he cope when he hears the news!  Patty Mills did an awesome job in the Olympics and has continued his great play in the season.
GTJ can join patty mills on the all-pirate team
International patty mills is the goat
Patty fucking mills goddamn
Is it bad I kinda want to see Ingles baynes and patty mills beat team USA?
Huh? Did she just say Patty Mills is the most exciting player in tokyo?
Patty Mills is a TeamUSA giant slayer…
"Right after I finish reading this post title, I saw the post right below is ""patty mills hit buzzer beating 3"" lol"
The thing is while Patty Mills isn't qualified at the moment I have no doubt if he wanted to be a politician he would do the work to become qualified.
As a Suns fan it pains me to say how I’ve always sort of loved Patty Mills. He’s awesome
"They don't call him Patty ""Patty Kills"" Mills for nothing"
"what a steal the aussie team gets thybulle, they actually could have used him on team usa today he's that impactful  think he's underrated offensively as well, he just doesn't get to feed much in a team with embiid, harris and one of the currys  it's going to be incredible both ways watching what mathief does for the boomers, but also the unique experience he'll take back to the nba the experience of the tenacity that comes with playing for the green and gold and alongside basketball demigods such as FIBA Patty Mills  going to be great couple of weeks for aussie bball fans"
At least patty mills is there for Australia when he is needed so why the fuck not
"all due respect to Mills but, Simmons disappointing in the NBA is still a better player than Patty lol"
"Playing for the national soccer team is more financially lucrative than playing for Team USA basketball. World Cups matter a lot more to a soccer player's legacy and endorsements than winning a basketball gold medal - especially for Americans, who the general public expects to win every game by 30.  I can't think of any NBA player who's ever gotten a big contract based on how they played in the Olympics. If they did, Patty Mills would probably be $100M richer than he is."
"San Antonio spurs, because patty mills."
"FIBA Patty Mills just keeps on where he left off. What an out and out champion, just goes to a whole new level when he puts on that green n gold."
Team USA is gonna fuck around and get shredded by Patty Mills again aren’t they?
Yup I am pretty happy right now with how Patty Mills just cold blooded destroyed your team in 2 seconds.
Olympic Patty Mills
GOAT right there. Top 3 GOATs:  1. Boomers Patty Mills 2. MJ 3. Olympic Melo
His team just got dad dicked by patty fucking mills so I guess he just had his homosexual awakening and love it so much he wants every Aussie man to take their turn.
Olympic Patty Mills
FIBA Mills could beat prime MJ 1v1 if Patty was representing Australia
When Patty Mills puts on the Australian uniform he turns into Michael Jordan lol
Olympic Patty Mills at it early
Olympic Patty Mills is a top 3 player all time
OLYMPIC PATTY MILLS IS HERE BABY
"Patty Mills is that guy, pal. Trust me he’s that guy"
FIBA PATTY MILLS IS A MONSTER
Patty fucking mills!!
I FUCKING LOVE PATTY MILLS AND MATISSE THYBULLE!!!
Patty fcking mills
Olympic patty fucking mills....
people don’t consider how big opportunity and role play in performance. Patty Mills will look like a better than player Bradley Beal in a majority of the games but in the NBA Beal is a max player and Mills is worth no more than like 8 mil nowadays
Gabe Vincent is gonna be the new international Patty Mills
"Talent is a huge factor tho, especially in a sport so dependent on individual talent. My team, Australia, is considered a genuine medal chance with a team led by Baynes, Patty Mills, Ingles and Matisse Thybulle-all NBA role players. The US with which ever players they have should be wiping the floor against such opposition"
National team Patty Mills is a force the be reckoned with. Hope Baynes is better for you than he was for us!
The disrespect to Patty Mills smh
Patty Mills is an Olympic monster dude was cooking
"One of the narratives that never gets discussed is that when Durant signed with the Warriors, he turned down the Spurs who had just won 67 games and had a top 10 SRS rating all time. They could have won 70 games but they took off the end of the season and dropped 3 of their last 5.   The roster featured an aging big 3 who were all still highly effective in 25 MPG type roles, a budding superstar in Kawhi, LaMarcus Aldridge at his peak and a cast of role players that included David West, Patty Mills, Danny Green and Boris Diaw. One of the deepest rosters the NBA has ever seen and a suffocating defense.   In terms of setting himself up for easy championships, Durant made the right call. All healthy and no drama and GSW is going for their 5th straight right now. SAS was going to have a lot of churn on its roster in any event and were clearly near the end of their window. But going to SAS would have probably still meant a couple of rings, Kawhi might have stuck around, and would have forever changed how we perceive Durant."
"He was the best defender but it’s not like he was a game wrecking force, Lebron was at 28/8/4 on 68% TS for the series   Also in the WCF before the finals Kawhi averaged 12/5/3 on 49% TS  In the finals Kawhi led the team in scoring, but it was 17 points a game. Tony gave 17 on much lower efficiency, TD was 15 on 61% TS, Ginobili was 14 on 65% TS, Patty Mills was 10 on 73% TS. It was a very balanced attack   Compare that to his Toronto run, it’s not close to the same workload   In the regular season that year Kawhi averaged 13/6/2 on +6%TS, this year Mikal was at 14/4/2 on +11%TS  I don’t think it’s a crazy comp to make, Kawhi was very much not a star at that point"
"this is not true. first of all derrick and dejounte can share the floor, they really complement each other in the best way possible, really, what one do not do, the other do it well. off the bench the bench we have lonnie walker who yes has defensive issues but he played alongside demar and often as a wing which he absolutely is not so he wasn't in a really good situation to defend, plus in general he's not that great. patty mills might leave and go to a contender while he fully go youth movement, win-win situation for both us and him. so we would have tre jones in development who showed really positive flashes, and we could sign a pg just in case too. we do not have five point guards, we are in a right situation in terms of guards, just no need to add more espeically considering how weak our frontcourt is.  i'll also add some other things from a post i did like more than a month ago about our situation, you can read it all if you want [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Let's begin by stating the versatily of the players. DJ is a pure PG, same goes with Tre. Derrick White is gonna start at SG, but he would have zero issues to play the PG  alongside Lonnie who on the other hand could slide at 1 for a small amount of time, but he is definitely a Pure 2 and not a 3 AT ALL, this season showed us this. Keldon is a full-time 3 but he can easily slide at 4 in a small-ball situation. About Devin I would say that he definitely need to play the 3 as his preferred position, he has all the tools to do so, and a solid summer in the gym would define it; he can slide at 2 regardless. DJ-DW Backcourt is really deadly. DJ proved this season that he is arguable the best player on the court without DeMar. And guess who is the other dude that is arguable the best player after DeMar? Derrick White. So yeah, a starting backcourt of this two is obvious and worked amazing when they were both fully healthy. I would play DJ and DW around 30+mins, maybe Derrick a couple of minutes more since he's more versatile. Off the bench Lonnie should definitely be our go-to-guy, our 6-Man. uly him more around 20-25m, limayeb slide him at 1 if necessary. Tre ones is also a really good fit with him, he needs a true PG like him that repares the play for him, they complement each other. The point is that Tre is not that ready, but he has to play, for sure, I would play him around 10-15m, but he can easily see his minutes go up if he keeps doing well! Devin at 3, maybe at 2 if needed, would be really good, a 3&amp;D guy like him is really amazing, I would play around just below 20mins. On defense our true liability is Lonnie, but he would find Tre and Devin, both elite defender, on the perimeter helping him so he can focus on his man and Lonnie showed he can be even above average if he focus on 1v1, imagine with an offseason of work.  also a ""small"" review on their season:  DEJOUNTE MURRAY  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  DERRICK WHITE  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  LONNIE WALKER IV  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him? I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  DEVIN VASSELL  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season"
I dont believe this at all lol.... the spurs wouldn't even trade patty mills at the deadline.  The only way to leave the spurs is if you demand a trade or they release you.
Patty Mills legit has the best looking free throw and 3 pointer around
"his shot selection was atrocious and his numbers since reflect that change. he had over 60%ts with no good shooters outside patty Mills, so a packed paint. he'd be better now than he was in Toronto, because he's many times the passer he was and finishes ridiculous well inside."
Him and Patty Mills doing St. Mary’s proud still to this day
Patty mills tho
Could easily see Otto Porter going to LA and same for Dwight. And maybe Patty Mills
"Joe Ingles &amp; Patty Mills, w Steve Adams as the enforcer"
"The 2016 spurs were so weird. They had a lineup consisting of Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobli, Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Danny Green, Patty Mills, etc. and didn't even finish first in their conference with 67 wins."
LeBron James / Monte Morris  Patty Mills / Gary Trent Jr.
"Lol why Patty Mills , he's a big flopper"
"Derrick White is at least as good as Dejounte. Our bench is above average - Rudy Gay is one of the best backup 4s in the whole league. Patty Mills was on fire the first half of the season. Trey Lyles who is an okay backup 4 lost all his minutes because our depth was good. Also Jakob Poeltl was literally one of the best rim protectors in the entire league this season based on stats, similar percentages as Rudy Gobert on less volume.  Our defense constantly looked disorganized this season, giving up a lot of easy transition buckets for no reason and our fast breaks on offense looked terrible.  There was absolutely no way we would end up with a similar record as the injured rockets, blatantly tanking thunder, injured wolves, pistons with a jobbing Griffin, injured magic, or the cavs who were basically paying 30M for nothing without significant injuries."
God I can’t wait for Olympic Patty Mills
Olympic Patty Mills is an All-NBA caliber player
Patty Mills kind of earned that because of his past performances for Australia.
Patty Mills is what J Cole would be if he was actually good enough at basketball to play in the NBA. They look so similar
Always rooting for Patty Mills!
Love Patty Mills
"I remember when I first moved to Australia 5-6 years ago, walking into a Rebel and there were Patty Mills Spurs jerseys for miles without a Kawhi in sight. By sheer number of jerseys on the rack he was up there with LeBron and Curry. Couldn’t believe it."
Ben Simmons will never be Patty Mills.
No Australian Olympian does more for Australia than Patty Mills
Patty Mills was listed by OP. Jingles was not…
Dude you spelt Boomer Patty Mills wrong.
Yeah this is basically Patty Mills asking for Lebron James money lmao
I’d say the same for the likes of Patty Mills and Joe Ingles with Australia. It’s so obvious when you hear them talk that the Boomers are so much more important to them than the NBA.
Nico Mannion becoming Italian Patty Mills was good to watch
"Yep, like a Patty Mills or Avery Bradley to back up Smart."
Never count out FIBA Patty Mills….
Olympic Patty Mills is no joke. The shortened 3 point line helps a lot of guards.
"&gt;Name one team that Rudy Gay has ever been the second best player on that was anywhere close to decent.  2018 Spurs won 47 games with LMA, post-Achilles injury Gay, 37yo Pau Gasol, and Patty Mills."
It's gotta be really fun for guys that are bench players in the NBA but big time go to players for their national team. Like Patty Mills.
"I remember when SA's G-league team signed him, I thought he could be a decent contributor. Like another Danny Green/Patty Mills waiver addition.  He showed flashes, but he was never good enough to be playing almost 30mpg. Honestly with his 3 shot I'm surprised he hasn't stuck around."
Ben Simmons flanked by all the shooters Australia has (especially Olympic version of Patty Mills) would be so much fun to watch.
I better not see Team USA get torched by Patty Mills again
Patty Mills will probably have one of the highest PPG in this tournament. High usage on a decent team.
Patty Mills has been with the Spurs longer than any player has ever played for the Nets
In b4 the Sixers sign Patty Mills
"Patty Mills and Rudy gay have even higher Def Ws than all 3 of them, 1 stat can’t be used to determine a players’ impact"
"I love the nickname Splash Bandicoot for Patty Mills, it's amazing"
"Those Nash Suns teams.  Even the recent mid 2010's Spurs teams.  Imagine Duncan, Leonard now with shooters in the corner like Patty Mills and Danny Green.  Oh yeah I can imagine it, they won a ring."
"There’s definitely a racial component no matter how you slice it. Another explanation is that a lot of the **universally** beloved players are foreign which, for some reason, makes them endearing to Americans. Look at Tacko, Luka, Boban, Patty Mills, Rui Hachimura, and Steven Adams."
Know any role player Point Guard’s that averaged 5-7 assist and knock down 3’s?   Off the top of my head idk DJ Augustine or Patty Mills?
"That’s interesting. So its 2 yr deal with LAC vs above the cap (non taxpayer) teams who can offer the full MLEx3yr and under the cap teams.  Alex Caruso is 27 with 4 year of NBA miles, RJ is 31 with 10 years. I see Caruso getting looks at the MLE range, maybe even an offer for $1-2 mill above MLE but looking below, it becomes unlikely and he instead see offers from other teams operating above the cap for full MLE.  To get a contract above MLE for RJ, half the league is able to do it: NYK, SAS, OKC, MIA, CHA, DAL, MEM, TOR, NWO, CLE, HOU, ATL, CHI, SAC, ORL, DET.  Looking at those teams, does RJ get a $12-15 mill offer from DET, ORL, SAC, CHI, ATL, HOU, CLE, NWO, TOR, CHA, OKC that would pry him from LA...I don’t think any of these teams make a real play for RJ as they already have their own guards and may not want to throw $50-60 mill for someone to be their 3rd guard in most cases. CHI could offer their entire cap space ($13-15) for him to be their 3rd guard if they want to compound it to show Zach they want to win 🤷‍♂️ but I think they have other targets.  Realistically, the only teams that chase are NYK, MIA, DAL...could include SAS MEM but they both have young guards and SAS cap space could get eaten by resigning free agents (Mills, Gay, DeRozan). RJ also has to contend with other PG Free agents:  Spencer Dinwiddie 28 Lonzo Ball 23 Derrick Rose 32 Patty Mills 32 Kyle Lowry 35 (Other PG unlikely to switch teams - cp3 and conley).  For the above the cap (but below tax payer bracket) teams: PHI, PHX (CP3 opts out and inks a $90 mill 3 yr deal), BOS, DEN, WSH, LAL, and IND...I only see PHI or IND making a play for him at full MLE to fill a big need.  Based on this, I think there is a good chance RJ sticks with LAC for that $10 mill/yr (for 2 years) that they can offer him. Unless PHI or IND enter the picture. Like Marks said, it’ll be an interesting free agency!"
"He'll definitely get more than $12 million, but he's coming off a serious lower body injury and has been an injury prone terrible shooter on a bad team for his entire career.  40% FG and 30% from 3 isn't going to put him above Dragic, CP3, Conley, Lowry or Lonzo, and he's maybe going to be closer in value to Patty Mills, Schroeder or Ish Smith.  Unless he's really worried about further injury problems and is hoping for a long contract, this might be a bad idea. Playing with KD, Harden and Kyrie would mean a few less minutes, but also put him on the championship stage, get him a ton of uncontested shots to boost his terrible spilts, and probably be in a situation where he can take as much time as he wants to make sure his Achilles is right. Also, not too much running."
"That's bad coaching then, isn't it? You always have to be prepared for injuries, and every player on the team should be ready to go. See: The Clippers. Also see: The Spurs in 2013-14 making guys like Boris Diaw and Patty Mills look like All-stars."
"Simmons for Patty Mills, Eubanks and a season pass to Sea World San Antonio"
Patty Mills hasn't played for us for a decade and I still miss him. Dude's awesome.
Yeah it depends on the offseason. If we’re moving on from Rudy and demar yes I trust the process. This Retool process. If we re-sign them then no. I want Patty mills to come back because he’s Patty mills
"Yup, hot take: Ricky Rubio or patty mills would be enough to be better than last year. Maybe not 1-3 good, but 4-6.  Now..  can we find space for one of them (maybe move tt?)  And that's assuming no other big moves."
"i would take Pop over say a Carmelo/Chris Bosh type of player. When I say Pop I mean the whole Spurs FO that was able to scout, develop, coach Tony, Manu, Kawhi,  Derrick White, Tiago, Keldon Johnson, George Hill, DeJuan Blair, Dejounte Murray, Danny Green (cut by the worst team in the league), Aaron Baynes, Boban, Patty Mills (never played meaningful mins in Portland), Jonathan Simmons"
Hopefully Jason Kidd will play him and Luka together more often than Rick Carlisle did. Would definitely help out Luka to stay fit in the 4th quarter and Jalen can give you good production in his minutes.  Brunson gives me a lot of vibes of Patty Mills or some other backup PG  that stays in the NBA for long time. I like his game.
They are locked in this was basically their core there's not much to really do other than small moves for role players on the margins. Do they even have their full MLE not sure. The thing they could use a creative offensive player/playmaker doesnt come cheap either. Patty Mills if he ever actually leaves San Antonio might be a good name  One thing I would not do is overpay to bring back PJ Tucker or Bobby Portis.
I would not trade Patty Mills for that
You're forgetting that Patty Mills turns into Allen Iverson during international play. Put him on the team &amp; watch him burn the US guards.
"&gt; Australia as we (or those who live externally from Australia) know it was built off of systemic oppression, invasion, and robbery of its original ancestors, the indigenous population.  What country and culture isn't? I can't think of a single one, not even isolated countries. They typically had a lot of infighting and localized oppression before they were integrated in a more global structure. I agree with what you said about how important it is that Patty Mills is a flagbearer though."
"Patty Mills probably could come out to Pop as being a woman this whole time and he'd be like ""ok""."
My head hurts lol Australia and Patty Mills and the video kept on repeating
Patty Mills is not retired
"and Spurs Patty Mills is top 500 player of all time, but top 10 teammate of all time :-)"
"Lol he wasn’t just like “woman Patty Mills” and then moved on, they all used that a spring board to start about woman’s equality and how great it was that two woman came out instead one of each. They were loud wrong"
"Patty Mills: ""Gentlemen. From this day forward, you will all refer to me by the name, Patty. hehahahaha""  Announcers: ""But isn't Patty, a woman's name?""  Patty Mills: *throws off jacket*"
I used to work with a Torres Islander. Patty Mills was his favorite player.

I’m confused was patty mills in this clip? The flag looked to be carried by a white dude and a women?

If your barrier for liking sports is knowing who patty mills is then like 95% of America doesn't like sports
I was like when did Patty Mills become white…then I saw the flag 😂
UK broadcasters mentioned Patty Mills being the first indigenous flag bearer and key player for the Boomers
Peppermint Patty Mills.
With a name like patty mills
The information said Patty Mills was a woman?
That’s Ms. Patty Mills to you!
"I had a serious glitch in the Matrix feeling, when I thought for a second Patty Mills was white and played for Austria."
"Yeah because its unclear what you are saying.  Patty Mills is 100% retired, he is playing a non-professional tournament for his country. Thats how it goes.  Top 40 most famous athelete at the olympics? I mean...maybe? But that doesnt really say anything of value. I am a big fan of the olympics an the nba and i didnt even know he was playing."
"God I hope patty mills shows up to the women’s game, Juwanna Mann style"
Does anyone even see Patty Mills in this video?
"You really didn't understand what I was saying. But regardless, cricket isn't an Olympic sport, Patty Mills isn't retired he's literally competing in the Olympics which is why he's there, and he's probably like a top 40 most famous athlete at the Olympics."
"To us NBA fans, this is a fucking outrage.  To the rest of the world, they too would be going ""....Patty Mills is not the lily white woman???"""
Thanks for this I was like that's... not even Patty Mills.
Austria? Patty Mills a woman? Gender equality?  Top shelf gaffe.
That man even doubled down on the Patty Mills is a woman thing LOL

Maybe he identified as a woman. Congrats on patty mills being the first woman to play in the NBA!
Now they’re saying Patty Mills is a man
Patty Mills is very pretty.
Patty Mills à women while we see only Austrian flags? What?
"The thing is this team has a guy playing at an all-time level and now the clout to pick up pieces on the cheap.  Like if I’m Patty Mills, I probably want to sign with the Bucks.  He knows Bud, he’ll get good minutes, and he can drastically improve their second unit.

"I mean you're right about the globalization of basketball and all that but let's not pretend that a team of the most elite basketball talent in the world should get cooked by Patty Mills and co. or the Heat's bench. I doubt either team will finish higher than us but still it's not really a thing that should happen, there's clearly some sort of dysfunction."
"It’s crazy how little Pop has the Spurs shooting threes these days cuz in those finals in 2013 and 2014 they were on fire   Ginobli, Danny green, Gary Neal, patty mills, I swear those guys didn’t miss"
What do you propose that they should have done? They traded away Bertans because of Morris who decided to break an agreement to sign with the knicks. Was there trade value for Rudy Gay or Patty Mills? Gay and Mills are also free agents this offseason.
"Just asked the wife and no, no he is not. But she doesn’t know who cp3 is either and she watches plenty of TV. The only Spurs player she knows of is Patty Mills because we took a tequila shot with him back in 2013."

If they can get Rudy Gay and Patty Mills it’ll be a  very solid  first day
Gary Trent Jr is American Patty Mills
"Hahaaaa you may be right, I just remember being incredibly frustrated that a guy as athletic as Demar was consistently as bad as Patty Mills, Bryn Forbes, and Marco Bellinelli at defense. He just does not have any defensive awareness."
"Yes, we all want to offer soon to be 33 year old Patty Mills 18m per year 😂🤣"
Im with you but he’s probably the best shooter we can get. Those other guys would be good to slot at the 3/4 but Patty would be great off the bench as a backup 1 behind Westbrook or a 2 next to him. Those other guys can shoot but I feel like Mills is on a whole other level.
You are smoking. Patty Mills is almost 33 years old and has showcased a level of play that is nothing greater than a role player. What he does in the Olympics does not matter to most NBA teams.
"These shit stain journalists are severely overestimating players desire to compete for a championship. Patty mills is playing his heart out in the olympics and if he continues along this pace and takes that australian team even to a bronze medal, hes looking at 4 yrs 60-80m easily."
Slander! You mean to say that Gary is the American Patty Mills.
"&gt;they had depth and team chemistry   You clearly didn’t watch the lakers. Depth was the one thing they lacked in 2020, in particular wing depth and point guard depth, one of the biggest talking point of the season was the lakers don’t really have the depth to win it all. It’s why everyone trashed the 2020 lakers off season.   Also Westbrook is one of the best chemistry players in the league. Every single team sings his praises and loves what he brings to the locker room. Chemistry will not be an issue this year.    &gt;rondo came off the bench so the lakers could have spacing   The lakers were also starting javale. Not exactly an elite floor spacer huh?   Also rondo couldn’t score, rebound, or run in transition as well as Westbrook. Westrbook has flaws but he is far superior than 2020 rondo and capable of scoring 20+ a game. Something the lakers desperately need.    &gt;how the hell do the lakers find spacing and defense   Patty mills. Rudy gay. Otto porter jr. melo. Dwight. All dudes at the top of my head reportedly looking to take a vet min or the mle to join the lakers. Finding shooters who can hit open corner threes is not that hard. Getting the third star made the lakers a far more appealing free agent destination by all reports. There are tons of shooters on the market and the lakers can still sign and trade schoder for someone. Why write off the team before it even built?   Spacing is just the new casual buzz word. The 2020 lakers and 2021 bucks were hardly spacing juggernauts. It turns out there’s more ways to score than just chucking up three pointers and praying you hit enough by law of averages."
They got rid of 3 dudes who don’t produce in the playoffs and also gained a lot of interest from free agents. Rudy gay is an upgrade from kuz. Melo/Patty mills and others are also solid vets they can add for cheap
And we shouldn’t be. We need Ellington Patty Mills and Rudy Gay
Bring Patty Mills with you Rudy
How can they afford Patty Mills? I was under the impression he’d have full MLE offers in the team at least.
"Not everybody is motivated by money… LA is the sports center of the world, amazing place to live with your family, Laker brand is bigger than basketball at this point, and Patty Mills is towards the end of his career. Laker situation is ideal for a guy like him."
Would patty mills sign for a bargain contract?
"Well they do have the $5.9M MLE to use too, but yeah for the most part they can only sign veteran’s minimum contracts. The bright side there is that the roster is so barren, that they do have bigger roles and opportunities to offer some of these guys.   If you’re Patty Mills for example, you’re not signing the minimum just to be an irrelevant ring chaser and ride the end of the bench, but to be a sixth man and play a huge part of the team.  Which means if everything does go well and you win the title, you have the chance to be immortalized in Lakers lore. Case in point, Dwight. Went from hated in the city, to now whatever happens he’ll always be loved in LA for his contributions to the 2020 title."
Going from Kuz/KCP/Harrell to Dwight/Russ/Patty Mills/Ellington is a huuuge upgrade. This isn’t even considering the return for the eventual Shroder S&amp;T. This is why judging moves individually when it happens is a waste of time and hilarious to see the reaction of.
Patty Mills would be a great signing
FIBA Patty Mills on the way to Tinsel Town
"I came here to post this. The best was in 2009 when you drafted 2 PGs in the top 6 of the same draft. That was a great draft for point guards as well, with 3 all-stars at that position alone, 1 of which is HoF lock (also Darren Collison, Pat Bev and Patty Mills). But you got absolutely none of them."
It's more of a matter of cap flexibility - you got 3 guys on your roster now making over 30M a year.  There's a decent amount of bargain-bin guys I'd be interested in; take Dennis on a reduced deal if he comes back with a tail between his legs. Wouldn't mind either Avery Bradley or Cory Joseph on a min. Same with Austin Rivers.  I'd hate to see them pry away TJ McConnell or Patty Mills but there's a few more names.
"Ya the issue is not the team or the location, it's the pay. Good luck convincing DeRozan, Batum, etc. to come on a vet min. You get one MLE, and that's it - after that, you're stuck with the dregs of whatever's left from Ariza/Jeff Green/Patty Mills.   Good luck beating the Nets with that."
GIVE ME PATTY MILLS
"I’d like to have a literal role player all stars like Afunkydiabetic’s list. Like, obviously it’s a shit accolade, but it’d be nice to see dudes get some shine who don’t typically.   If it’s anything like how Evan Fournier and Patty Mills play in the Olympics then it’d be a lot of fun."
I will not tolerate this Patty Mills slander.
"I honestly think we've earned a solid player development rep. If I were a prospect or someone on the precipice of being out of the NBA, I'd definitely see if the Spurs were interested in signing me for cheap just to develop and try to carve out a role.  Think of all the dudes who got great second contracts after playing for SA.  Beno Udrih - drafted 28th overall, played decent minutes as a rookie as the backup PG for a title winning team in 05. We trade him to Minne in his final year of his rookie deal to cut costs, he ends up as a FA and signs with SAC, who then extend him on a 5 year 32mil deal.  Ian Mahinmi - he barely plays with us, but we keep him on the roster for 3 years. He signs a minimum deal with DAL, then winds up being part of a S&amp;T to Indiana on a 4/16mil deal. Eventually makes bank with a 4/64mil deal with the Wizards in the dreaded 2016 off-season.  George Hill - we took a chance on him when other teams were scared off due to IUPUI being deemed too small of a school. He develops, we trade him again in the final year of his deal and signs multiple high $ contracts over a very long career.  Gary Neal - a guy we brought in from overseas, who I think was 26 at the time, signed a 3 year contract for relative peanuts with team outs after the first season. His total earnings from SA were only ~2mil over 3 seasons, but then he signed a 2 year 6.5mil deal with MIL, then another 1 year deal for the vet min with the Wizards, which because he had been an NBA vet for 5 years at that point was a little over 2mil  DeJuan Blair - made 4mil on his rookie deal over 4 years with SA, then made another 4.5mil while bouncing around the league another 3 years.  Kyle Anderson - develop him into a great roleplayer, he signs a solid deal with Memphis that he's actually out-performed and is in line for a bigger pay day on his next deal.  Johnathon Simmons - probably the best example of this trend. He literally walked-on to try out for the (at the time) Austin Toros. The FO sees something in him and signs him to a 2 year deal with most of the money unguaranteed. He makes the most of his opportunities in 16 and 17, playing great defense on Harden in the playoffs and doing enough on offense to take advantage of Harden's defense. Signs a 3/24 with Orlando.  This isn't even counting guys like Danny Green and Patty Mills, who were claimed off the waiver wire and have ended up earning a ton while becoming fantastic players."
Patty Mills signing with everyone this off-season
"Those were just examples. Not the best case scenario. And why wouldn't lebron try? he was on his path to first team defense when he got injured. And i believe in Vogel, that it would be atleast a top 10 defense.   May be we can get patty mills. or Danny green back. DG just shot 40% in philly and lebron and russ would give him more open looks. so does patty. For the second unit, we have caruso to defend and shoot 3. Carmelo, if we get him, is a 40 percent shooter last seson. Kief is a good defender and can play 4 or 5 and can also shoot threes.   And maybe we can get a couple of $10 mill each 3 and D players outof SNT Schroeder. They can be our starters with AD on 5.   My point was... we have 10 places to fill. Can't judge at team by 5 signed players. There are many options and possibilities. Talk bs after we have the whole team ready for the season."
"He’s a decent starting point guard. I don’t like him because of the way he handled his Lakers contract. He’s an asshole. But people saying I’ll take Patty Mills or DRose over Schroder don’t understand that those guys aren’t starting 82 games and if you are a team looking to just make the playoffs, you need guys who will play hard in regular season games."
Patty mills is not a starting point guard for an 82 game season.
"We aren't going to add Schroder, lol.  If the Bulls give Lonzo too big a bag we'll go looking in the trade market or, like, Patty Mills or something before Schroder."
"I'm a little surprised that Dell Curry isn't on this list. He's like the all-time leader in games played off the bench, and at least three of the guys on this never-fouled out list are also very high in that bench games category (Crawford, Patty Mills, Kerr)."
"Miami just picked up his option but still likely Dragic gets moved. Tim Hardaway could be on the move. Evan Fournier could be on the move. Norman Powell is out there coming off 2 really really solid seasons. Patty Mills can shoot the shit out of the ball. Dinwiddie is a name but I think he might end up getting paid.   That’s a few, and I know there’s a couple other names that’ll get much less but still be good for a team."
"&gt; maybe is Jrue/Middleton show up besides the fourth the game doesn't go to OT?  And maybe Patty Mills turns into a 45pts average player on 60/50/90 for one series. I mean everything is theoretically possible, but neither player has EVER shown to have a consistent series, and in fact, almost always have more bad games than good games (and definitely a lot more than great games).   Expecting them to wildly and uncharacteristically overperform is not the same as expecting Joe Harris to make a bit more than *half* of what he makes in the regular season."
"Can’t wait to play the Lakers’ summer league team of Melo, Derozan, Patty Mills, Dwight and Avery Bradley"
"Hello no, patty mills shoots too damn much. Doesn’t know how to stop himself."
"If you could get the players to buy into a 1 v 1 tourney it'd be incredible, but I could see it going the other way too if players didn't care and then you watch like patty Mills vs Bryn Forbes or something."
Looks like USA has a harder road than Slovenia. They have to get thru Spain and Olympic Patty Mills.
"I don’t know about this. Lakers should focus on spending and trading for quality shooting, like Patty Mills. Debt is important, off course. But look at the Nets, they figured out picking up players and buy-outs."
"Report: Lakers also have ‘strong interest’ in Demar DeRozen, Kyle Lowry, Carmelo Anthony, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gay, Trever Ariza, Andre Iguodala, Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Statue of Liberty."
"Lol Slovenia aint getting to the finals anyways, but I will trust in Patty Mills to get us to the finals. #AllHailBalaPat"
"Along with Patty Mills, Avery Bradley, Rudy Gay, DeMar DeRozan, Nic Batum, Jeff Green, Reggie Bullock  Did i miss anyone"
"Wayne Ellington and Patty Mills are great ideas. Pure shooters. The rest are a bit old, good on end of bench roles but I want my rotation filled out more first."
Patty Mills might have something to say.
Olympic patty mills&gt; Olympic Ricky Rubio
"Better PG duo, Steph Curry and Damian Lollards or Olympic Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio"
"he was one of the league leaders the last two years for three point shots generated. and yeah there aren't gonna be a lot of shots at the rim when our leading 3 point shooter was Lonnie Walker at 35%. our team composition is trash so frankly it's a miracle DeMar had the assists and scoring percentages he had.   our entire team is full of dudes who are slashers from DJ to BIG BODY. Patty Mills shot well for a month or two and then was ass the rest of the year. if you swap him out for Bojan or Conley on the Jazz, where guys actually not only took but also hit threes, he'd have looked even better. obviously he hurts team spacing and that hurts his value but our entire team had no spacing lol"
"We should totally sign Patty Mills. I hate that Mark is always so focused on a big name, when it's smart additions that lead to winning. Would help with Josh Green prob too"
Imagine thinking Patty Mills would sign a deal that fits into a Lakers cap exception lol
I just can't hate you guys. Patty Mills is still one of Manu's best friends and such a cool dude.
Patty Mills with what money...
"As much as I would love Patty Nills on this team, that love would not be as strong were it framed around Mills as a starter."
patty mills when he is on boomer mode
I've been one of the biggest Patty Mills hater for no reason. He might be the new Kuzma for me.
"As a Spurs fan, I’d take him over Patty Mills right now. If you think you’re getting Olympic Patty during the NBA season, you are sorely mistaken."
"Lakers will be picking up a lot of vets that will eat up his minutes. Specifically shooters and with THT’s biggest weakness being his shooting, guys like Carmelo, Wayne Ellington, Patty Mills, and all the other vets the Lakers will sign will eat his minutes."
"At this point literally every team wants Patty Mills, lol."
"We’re going to see a Patty Mills thread for every team in the league, aren’t we."
If Patty Mills played the way he did in FIBA in the NBA he’d be a max player.
Every team in the league in interested in Patty Mills.
"Don't forget who drafted Patty Mills, current /r/nba GOAT."
"That list is still almost up to date.  Scola has moved into 4th place and Gasol has added some points, but is still a distant 3rd.  Everyone else was done before 2009.  Patty Mills is currently at 426 points counting these Olympics.  If Australia wins their Quarterfinals game then Australia is guaranteed 3 more games and Mills could easily pass 3 of these guys.  Assuming he plays in 1 more Olympics he has a chance to move into top 3 all time, but will more likely end up in 4th place."
"Good point. If Iggy comes back on a vet min, that's one more who played a significant chunk with the franchise already. As a fan I'm hoping for Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, or Batum to come along for the MLE."
Lebron's minutes are already at career lows. The Lakers don't need a supermax player like WB to help with that load someone like Patty Mills would have done the job.
Most likely S&amp;T for Lonzo and Patty Mills. We've given up on Fournier imo
Olympic Patty Mills doesn't mess around.
"I think Russell is talking more about Patty Mills constantly moving without the ball, not his shooting"
"They've been linked to Lonzo and Patty Mills I think. Fournier will also get a decent contract. Or if this is long-term, hoping for Bradley Beal next year?"
* PG - Tony Parker * SG - Patty Mills * SF - JJ Barea * PF - Rafer Alston * C - Stephen Curry
Mills get hot call em Patty Melt.
Patty mills once hit game winner against mexico and even I can't help to wish he wins a medal
And patty Mills coming to the Lakers? Nice
patty mills beat lebron james in 2014
Patty Mills international legend
"MJ wasn't even the best player in the Dream Team, Chuck was. What I'm saying is I wanna see Dream Team Chuck vs Tokyo Olympics Patty Mills"
I just love how Patty Mills went from forgotten bench player on the Spurs to being recognized as *the* vital cog on the Australian team.
Patty mills has been so solid his whole career. Wish we had kept him on the blazers all those years ago
Patty “Mr Olympian” Mills
"Shrink to about 8 guys.  &gt;I think Patty Mills is going to command well better than the taxpayer MLE. I think that's a non-starter.  Perhaps he will. He was just an example. There's always guys who are willing to go to big markets to ring chase. Its obviously going to be tight but I think its manageable. Even if the Lakers just bring back their own free agents, they'll probably be doing okay for the time being. They'll probably then grab a guy or two on the buyout market too. I know this is a basic way of thinking about basketball but their 3 will probably score 70 odd points a night between them at a minimum. Its not like they're going to be super dependent on depth this year"
Shrink to what? I think Patty Mills is going to command well better than the taxpayer MLE. I think that's a non-starter.  I don't where these 4 guys are coming from with 5.9 million MLE and veteran minimum contracts. It pains me to say it as a big fan but I think Gasol is pretty washed.
"The thing is, the Lakers can afford to have those types of guys all regular season. And then once the playoffs arrive, their rotation can shrink. I think ultimately, they need 4 more legit guys to go along with their 3 and Gasol. Players like Gay, Wes Matthews, Otto Porter and Patty Mills are out there and all would work. Melo too, although I've learnt from experience not to trust his defense"
"You do not mess with International Patty Mills, but they do need Baynes back if they want to move further on for a medal"
"I’m American, but I always root team Australia for basketball. Patty Mills is the goat"
"If Patty Mills wins a gold, do you think that gets him into the Hall of Fame?"
Any chance of us getting an [AUS] Patty Mills flair????
"Really just opportunity. I know we get jokes off about people sucking but every player in the nba is really good. So when they get to their Olympic teams and have the chemistry built with their teams and the opportunity do be theirselves, you get Olympic Patty Mills"
Bro why patty mills turns into michael jordan when playing with the australian national  team but is just a role player in the nba?😂😂😂
Team Australia patty mills or a duo of prime MJ and Prime LeBron?   Personally I'm  going Team Australia Patty and it's not particularly close
I come to the Australia threads just for the Patty Mills comment.
"&gt; Patty Mills putting on an absolute clinic to put Australia in a strong position in the 4th. A stream of points, assists and forcing triple teams every possession.   Started off missing a lot of shots as well. But they don't let you share flag carrying duties for nothing!"
"Patty Mills putting on an absolute clinic to put Australia in a strong position in the 4th. A stream of points, assists and forcing triple teams every possession.   You bloody love to see it."
PATTY MILLS
Put Patty Mills on the Australian Mount Rushmore next to Cathy Freeman
"Depth. Patty Mills is a 6th man who only plays around 20 minutes anyways and is about to turn 33 years old. Everything that happened to the Nets this year is why they need a serviceable backup PG  Irving missed 20 regular season games and then games in the playoffs  Harden missed 30 regular season games and then games in the playoffs  They thought they didnt need a back up PG and it ended up biting them in the ass severely. Then they had to sign Mike James and play PG by committee.  This signing can take the work load off of Kyrie who has missed significant time the last 2 years and now they have Harden who is battling a hamstring. That type of injury tends to stay with athletes.  They just got rid of Shamet. Bruce Brown and Tyler Johnson are FAs.  Plus even if push came to shove and you needed to play all 3, that can easily be done in a small ball line up. Shit there are lineups that get thrown out there where KD could play the 5 or even BG against other teams."
Patty Mills is more of a SG tbh &amp; definitely will be that in Brooklyn
"Your eyes are not correct. 2014 was early Spurs, and his body fat was reported as 5.8%. This was his second full season.  https://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/the-skinny-on-fatty-patty-mills-20140612-zs5o3.html  I've followed this guy his whole career. His look, with the beard and dredds has changed, but he only really needed one wake up call from Pop about his body shape. Since the Fatty Mills comment that Pop made publicly, he hasn't come back out of shape once.  If anything, his size in Portland was way too skinny for his position.  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/portland-trail-blazers-point-guard-patrick-mills-brings-the-ball-up-picture-id109085209?s=2048x2048"
"It's going to so tough for me watching the bronze medal game.  On one hand, Australia has suffered too much to fall short again. They've have suffered through years of heartbreaking losses and poor officiating... coming so close but that elusive medal barely slipping through their grasp every time. And if anyone has ever been deserving to go out a winner... it's Patty Mills. He's poured his heart and soul into this program, taking it from an afterthought to ranked 3rd in the entire world.  On the other hand, Luka Doncic has been nothing short of inspiring this summer. Slovenia had never qualified for Olympic basketball... until Luka. Taking a country with the population of New Mexico to a chance to medal is just incredible. The dude has literally put an entire country on his back and willed them to within one game of a medal.  Will always root for FIBA Patty first... but I'm going to be heartbroken for whoever comes up short. Both deserve to leave Tokyo with a medal."

"Maybe in time, Slovenia too can have it's own Patty Mills copypasta about bad calls deciding games."
Bob Fitzgerald is a fucking idiot though. He was so obsessed with Patty Mills and KD. Clearly the USA has a ton of guys that can light it up. So let’s not go crazy with the hot takes of a terrible play by play guy.
"It's going to so tough watching the bronze medal game.     On one hand, if anyone has ever been deserving to go out a winner... it's Patty's Boomers. He's poured his heart and soul into this program, taking it from an afterthought to ranked 3rd in the entire world.

"He is an amazing pickup for the Nets. I just don’t get why he would prefer to go to a guard-heavy team instead of say the Lakers or the Mavs.  The ideal fit would be Patty to the Mavs, and they trade for Heild. Then you get a big three of Luka, Mills, Hield. That would be filthy, and he’d be the main guy.  My point is that he’ll be a role player with the Nets, and that’s just not how I picture Mills."
You forgot that if this were to happen Olympic Patty Mills would be in play
Oh wow must be an accomplishment to carry this stacked team past the legend patty mills LMAO
"Im American btw just rooting for my man mate Patty Mills, tonight was a win-win for me"
"Yeah dude, I was only passing along what I read on here a couple weeks ago.  He is insanely talented, but his obvious weaknesses have been spotlighted since his last game, so he's worried or prideful, according to that thread, to have a bad look if Patty Mills still got more minutes than him..  not saying I agree.."
Patty Mills will start in Brooklyn at some point load management/injuries
"Like who? Lakers and Nets I assume. Don’t think Patty Mills makes the Nets that much better but even then one of Harden, Kyrie or KD will be injured by the time playoffs roll around so it won’t be a sweep especially considering games will be played at Fiserv and Giannis is the best 2-way in the world."
"seriously, I know not all 2nd picks are gonna become starters or even serviceable players, but the most recent MVP is a second round pick. One of our greatest players of all time was the 2nd to last pick. Draymomd Green is a DPOY and a vital part of championship teams, second round pick. Even a player like Patty Mills was the 55th pick.  9 times out of 10 its nothing, but the idea that 2nd round picks are useless is wrong."
&gt;Patty Mills can't win with these cats smh my head.  That's why he's teaming up with KD. IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
"Wholesome, I love it! Haha.  Also the Patty mills/Pop hug."
 patty mills has been playing amazing in the olympics
Patty Mills will be our Khris Middleton stopper apparently. Dude stripped him on back to back possessions.
"I don’t know where they would put it, but Patty Mills deserves a statue somewhere in Australia for being such a bad ass every major competition"
"At the end of the day, it's just conditioning.   Other than Patty Mills or sometimes Jingles, pretty much everyone on Team AUS either play short FIBA games or are role players in the NBA. Even on their worst shooting night, everyone on Team USA can keep up."
"oh word? without a team usa player we lose   dope  without patty mills you...oh wait, you already lost with him  goodbye"
they can coast in the first half they're just that good  similar against spain. caught up right before half like it was nothing and continued after half.  PATTY MILLS still the goat
That Patty Mills and KD moment though
Kevin Durant turned up big time and was unguardable. The Americans managed to shut off Patty Mills as well.
if there is one thing to take away from this game its that patty mills on the floor with james harden running the offense is gonna be lethal
"Patty Mills can't win with these cats smh my head.  On a serious note, what a game by KD, he was on a mission today. Single handedly turned around the game on the first half of the 3rd quarter and then Book and the rest of team USA followed his lead to secure the W. Feel bad for Patty tho, hopefully Australia comes home with that bronze!!"
"We're alright... it was always longshot to topple the biggest Goalith in the history of sports.  But can't give up now because a historic medal for Australia still in sight. One win. ***One. More. Win.*** And all the past heartbreak can be forgotten.  *Words cannot describe how badly I want Patty Mills to win this medal.* If anyone has ever been deserving to go out a winner... it's Patty. He's poured his heart and soul into this program, taking it from an afterthought to ranked 3rd in the entire world.  But so far there's still nothing to show for it as Australia has yet to win a medal in basketball. The Patty Mills-led Boomer teams have suffered through [years of heartbreaking losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o9uve7/patty_mills_reaction_to_simmons_withdrawing_from/h3e52ir?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and poor officiating; coming so close but that elusive medal barely slipping through their grasp every time. Finishing 4th again and again in brutal fashion. I'm come to conclude 4th is the absolute worst place to finish. So close... but so far.  Well, it's now or never. They've come too far to fall short again. Please bring it home, Patty... bring it home."
Stop showing me a watery-eyed Patty Mills. My heart can't take it.
Dawg I didn't wanna see teary eyed patty mills 😭
If Ben Simmons costs Patty mills a medal we should remove his citizenship.

Truly I don’t understand how the Olympics turns Patty Mills into a basketball god
"Would have been wild if we won this, but Jeez I was hoping we would put up more of a fight than this.  US intensity has gone up, been hitting the shots you'd expect them to, but we've just dried right up.  Everything crossed for Patty Mills and the crew in the bronze medal match, don't think I could take another heartbreaking 4th finish"
"Nets are likely above the Lakers. Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, Nic Claxton, Blake Griffin."

I'm still hopeful Patty Mills resting early would eventually pay off lol
"Durant can't clearly win against Patty Mills, Dellavedova and Ingles, yet LeBron was supposed to beat the 2018 Warriors."
Patty Mills shot selection is low key insane
"It’s so weird. I know we talk about roster construction but the honest truth is the Damian lillard, Tatum, etc are being outplayed by guys like patty mills, Ricky Rubio, and Evan Fournier. I have no idea why international players seem to get way better in fiba while USA players seem to play much worse!"
I think Patty Mills would be Michael Jordan actually.
First time Australian viewer here. Patty Mills is obviously the GOAT so why isn’t he slam dunking in every attack
"I feel like I'm watching Space Jam, but the MonSTARS have FIBA Patty Mills."

"With 6 minutes remaining Australia has conceded a 13-2 run and were leading just 85-80.      - 5:55, Dante Exum draws an offensive foul.  - 5:40, Dante Exum hits a corner 3, 88-80.  - 5:15, Dante Exum gets a transition dunk. 90-80.   - 4:15, Dante Exum drives in and finds Ingles for a corner three as Australia break away.    Further down the track in the last 2:30, Dante Exum made clutch free throws and hit a dagger 3!    Patty Mills was sensational with his buckets but Dante Exum was also INSTRUMENTAL in turning the tide again when momentum was against us and securing the victory."
Patty Mills POPS OFF for 42 Points to give Australia their first Medal in Australian Olympic Basketball History!

Patty Mills is who Dante Exum thinks he is
Patty Mills is a national icon.

I'm about to have to put patty mills as my religion on the census.
Who is this Luke Doncic guy? Is he like the Slovenian Patty Mills? If so hopefully he learns a lot tonight from Mills and he can come back a better player next olympics.
Patty Mills is just the better player over Luka. I mean he is an NBA Champion and Luka has not even been able to get past 1st round. Can't deny facts folks. Checkmate Lukasexuals
"Patty Mills is an absolute beast and Thybulle is really disruptive on the defensive end, thrown down some solid jams too!"
Don't forget Patty Mills looking like prime MJ out there. 26 points... in the first half
"Patty Mills, my countries GOAT"
Can we knock down the Opera House and build a Patty Mills statue plz
Patty mills' passes 😍😍😍
"In that case, no, they aren’t a super team. Unless, of course, Cam Thomas is the Prince That Was Promised or Patty Mills is “Ozzy National Team Patty.” If either of those players show up it’s still a super team.  They’re still the favorites to win, though."
What how is Kyrie a chucker? He's efficient as hell. Also how does Patty Mills have anymore knack for winning than Kyrie?
"Patty mills does not make kyrie expendable. It helps strengthen guard rotation to try and make up for kyrie, but nothing can actually replace him"
Well no shit. Patty Mills makes Kyrie expendable. Best signing of the offseason.  The more interesting question is if the Nets' odds of making the Finals goes up or down if they dump Kyrie into OKC's cap space.
And upgraded the roster. Patty Mills is so solid and if Aldridge has anything left that's another great signing.
Patty mills. Veteran. Not ball dominant. Good enough jump shot. Great facilitator. Better defender.
This team being lead by Patty Mills is honestly a scarier team.
"Bledsoe was pretty good the year before in the regular season. I'm guessing SVG thought he would turn it around eventually, he just never did. A few years back, tons of spurs fans were calling for Pop to barely play Patty Mills and for Bryn Forbes to take over his role the next season. It can work out but nothing's certain."
"Ah ok. Still, I think there's some merit to keeping younger players behind older players for a while. Plus it's not like he was usually on the bench, he played a lot of games around 20 minutes. Pop is well known for doing a similar thing and you don't see people on here acting like he's an idiot.  It's easy to say in hindsight that that was not a good decision but some coaches rely on their vets even if it seems like they're declining. Pop did similar things with Tony Parker and Patty Mills."
"his comment is dumb as fuck  he thinks the only argument Pop has over Phil is that he's coached for 5 more seasons?  like even if you believe Phil &gt; Pop , you should at least have basic common sense to know that Pop has won his 5 rings with much less talent in a small market and re tooled his team on the fly  spurs went from twin towers (1999) -&gt; 4 down offense with Duncan (2003) -&gt; integrating Parker/Manu (2005/2007) -&gt; Tony/Manu lead (2008-2011) -&gt; complete team offense (2011-2015) -&gt; iso heavy with Kawhi/Aldridge (2016 -&gt; )  Look at how players actually improved under Pop or Pop maximized their talent. Parker became a complete PG. We took guys like Danny Green who got cut from the worst team in the league and made him into a starter on a championship team. Same with guys like Patty mills who never played a meaningful minute on the Blazers. Kawhi expanded his game. Dejuan blair was a starter for us on a 62 win team and after he left was out of the league in a few years.   But sure, thanks for your contribution to the discussion!"
"Bad day to be an Aussie point guard, patty mills could be next"
"Given the departures of vets like demar, Rudy gay, and Patty mills, there’s a lack of clear rotations and on ball roles for the team, and they have to work that out. Pop has been experimenting with various lineups all preseason, and given the plan with Primo is to start his development in the g league it’s perfectly fine that he’s not part of this season’s rotation plans, even though he could quickly play himself into the lineup"
"Ok, but the Bucks almost lost to Durant and Harden on one leg. Now they have Harden with 2 legs plus Patty Mills. Bucks are the same team. We'll see, but it's easy on paper to say the Nets win that series today."
Patty mills!! Just borrow some Olympic bunting from Tokyo and put it up in Barclay's.. It'll help activate patty's big balls mode
Patty. Mills.  I promise I’m not biased.
I guess they’ll have to settle for Patty Mills at guard. So sad that they’ll only be playing with 2 superstar league MVPs 😔
The real reason Brooklyn signed Patty Mills
For all our championships we have had our share of heartbreak. 0.4. 2012 Thunder. Bosh out to Allen bang! Kawhi getting Zaza'd after assimilating into Michael Jordan for a half. Patty Mills leaving. A bat dying. Finding out Tim Duncan is an avid hunter. Some of it just sucks man
I mean they’re basically just a bunch of vets and are wasting a massive chunk of the cap on a third star. If they knew kyrie wasn’t going to be there and had that extra cap they probably could have gone out and gotten more help than washed up paul milsap and Patty mills. They’re not awful players or anything but they’re not making up for kyries production. Hell they might have been able to afford a real center to throw at embiid and giannis in the playoffs. Overpay for Dwight/javale or something to bolster their weak interior defense
"To echo Steve Nash, who is taking that 3rd spot on Brooklyn. Will it be Patty Mills/Joe Harris? Or maybe one of the vets?   Personally I could see it being Mills because he has so much experience and he’s a good scorer. That kinda fits what Kyrie was doing as a scoring option for the team. Patty obviously isn’t the player that Kyrie is but he could definitely come in and get open buckets from Harden and KD’s gravity."
"I think Nash, Marks, and Tsai sort of all concluded they really don’t have to deal with his bullshit now that they have James Harden and an army of vet mins begging to play for them. Patty Mills was an unreal signing in hindsight.   Just insane leverage to stand up to a superstar like this refusing to play by essentially saying idc. Any other team would implode with a situation like this"
I love the inclusion of Patty Mills - Tokyo GOAT.
If you subtract 30 million from the nets salary and tax payments they are still the second highest paying team after the warriors at 276 million. Compare that to the bucks at 212 mil.  They have the biggest advantage in the world of getting the bird rights of superstars forcing their way to the team. Oh yah and not having to pay 10-15 million per year players like patty mills and Blake griffin /lma anything at all because the leagues fucked like that
With all that firepower in harden and Durant I’m sure Patty Mills will suffice in the playoffs.
Unfortunately I think this will be Jim's big injury year. He's always carried a few Kilos extra weight and with the exxtra workload created by the anti vaxxer it could be the straw that breaks the camel back. Look for Olympic Bronze medallist Patty Mills to step up into a 33 minute per game role. If Vin can play at an MVP level the Nets are still an outside chance at the Larry.
patty mills &gt; dlo
"Nets have got Patty Mills.  Who needs Kyrie.  Great shooter , great feeder for Harden and KD and one of the best off the ball movers."
&gt;Patty mills ain’t replacing that.  But Olympic Patty Mills would be another story.
"They won’t get out of the East with just Harden and KD. No Kyrie no chip. Even if they somehow did get out of the East they wouldn’t have enough to beat the Lakers without Kyrie y’all are letting your personal feelings about Kyrie affect how y’all perceive his value.  A 27, 5, &amp; 5 guy on 50, 40, 90. Patty mills ain’t replacing that. All nets fans did was say if they had Kyrie they would’ve won now people are trying to make it seem like he’s insignificant y’all are crazy!"
"Nets are so far over the cap that Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills and Bruce Brown could all be vaporized by a Martian space laser tomorrow and they still wouldn't have any room to sign anybody above the minimum."
patty mills
Patty Mills bout to go off
Patty Mills: *Am I a joke to you mate?*
Uh no he was not close to Patty Mills level
I mean he was signed for the whole year. But only played in 13 games. He seems like he could be a Patty Mills type if he had more usage.
We never did. He's not Patty Mills.
"I'm sure he'll be fine when he's coaching KD, Harden, Patty Mills, Blake, Paul Millsap and Joe Harris"
"""Are you not entertained?""  - James Johnson, Patty Mills and Joe Harris, probably."
Haven’t you heard? Patty mills &gt; James harden and it ain’t even close
Patty Mills??? Lamarcus Aldridge??? LMFAOOOO Bucks in 6
"LOL….this is SAD…..  LeTrash Couldnt win in Cleveland with a prime SHAQUILLE O’NEAL AND JAMARIO MOON so he hopped and teamed up with an FMVP and All-NBA franchise player on a pay cut. Stacked the deck with HOF role players. Only to lose 2 rings to JJ Barea and Patty Mills. LOL.  Once he squeezed Miami’s window completely dry, he went back to Cleveland, which had stockpiled a ton of assets and was able to get 2 All-Star franchise players around him. Kyrie was an All-Star BALLER and K. Love was dropping 30/30 like he was Chamberlain!   The second he loses another Finals because KD is better and he has ZERO mental fortitude, he signs with LA. He couldn’t even make the playoffs lmao. Traded the entire core of the team for a Top 5 player in the league just to win 1 LeMickey ring in the bubble. Got bounced in the 1st round and now he LeGMd his way into coercing FO to getting another MVP around him.  LeMickey the GOAT? Nah. He a Top 10 SF for sure. JorGamble best."
Nets are way better too than last year. Healthy harden + patty Mills + lma + Aldridge. Harden was at like 20% of his normal selt
"Big cost of depth??? Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, Paul Millsap--I think they recovered that depth just fine"
Patty Mills is the reason I watch international basketball
Patty mills  Oh and it’s the best sport
Never have I have been more glad that Kyrie never committed to the Boomers then these last few months. Fuck this antivax nonsense and it warms my heart to see that the team isn't letting this crap slide. Gives patty mills some more minutes as well ahah
"Stop it. Patty Mills is a fine bench player. Kyrie on the court is electric, and an All-NBA level player."
This is so disrespectful to James Harden.   Patty Mills is who makes Kyrie expendable. Harden is several tiers above that.
Who’s ready for Kyrie Irving Ewing Theory? Cause Patty Mills about to blow up.
"I’m a Spurs fan and Mills lover, but bruh, Patty wouldn’t be coming off the bench for an SA team that didn’t make the playoffs if he was in the same realm of Kyrie. The Nets best chance of winning is with Kyrie on their team. Either he’ll eventually get the shot or the mandates will relax."
Is Patty Mills a better choice than Kyrie Irving ?  &amp;#x200B;  yes.
MVP- Lebron   MIP- Jordan Poole    DPOY- AD     6th man- Patty Mills    ROTY- Josh Giddy
Patty Mills who'll be winning the 6MOTY award
Is patty mills a low ballet HOFer? And why is the answer yes?
"I’m sorry Patty Mills, the tribe has spoken. Please bring me your torch…"
"I also agree Australian basketball is on the up, but it differently didn't start with Patty Mills haha.   Before that was Andrew Gaze, the 90s NBA global boom and Luc Longley being on the bulls was huge. That's what Patty and Andrew Bogut came out of. The NBL in Australia also started to really put an emphasis on American imports in the 90s and this lead to the dad's of current NBA players like Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving coming to Australia. And now we get to the new generation with Giddey who grew up with Patty's generation."
"Australia is only getting started I think. Popularity has been going up and up, and it started with Patty Mills, so kids who watched Patty win in SA are only starting to hit their stride now."
Patty Mills has to be the #1 signing of the offseason.   He makes Kyrie expendable.
"I always thought your signings were weak af, foh. Remember when you all thought you were getting Derozan, Rudy Gay, and Patty Mills?"
"I don’t know about the quickest, but Patty Mills need a split second to get a shot off"
"Question from NBA.com’s GM Survey 2021-22:  Which active player will make the best head coach someday?  1. Chris Paul, Phoenix – 34%  2. Rajon Rondo, Lakers – 14%  3. T.J. McConnell, Indiana – 10%  4. Mike Conley Utah – 7% Udonis Haslem, Miami – 7% Garrett Temple, New Orleans – 7%  &gt; Also receiving votes: Harrison Barnes, Sacramento; Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana; Draymond Green, Golden State; Joe Ingles, Utah; LeBron James, Lakers; Patty Mills, Brooklyn"
Patty Mills really gonna carry the Nets
"KD+Harden is easily the best duo in the league (Can make an argument for top 5 for both of them).   Then on top of that, even an out-of-prime Blake Griffin, Aldridge, Milsap helps round out the PF (or small ball C) C position.  None of these guys can give you 40 minute of elite ball but each of them can give you about 10-15 minutes of solid ball at this stage.  Then at the guard spot you still have Patty Mills+Joe Harris who are both great shooters and both could probably start on a lot of teams.  Then at the C position you have Claxton who isn't ideal but he's still been really good and starter-caliber. He isn't really a weakness since they will play a lot of small ball and they don't really need him to do much other than set screens, get rebounds, and play average-level defense.  Then ass an insurance policy they have Bruce Bowen who looked really legit last year. They also have Cam Thomas who I think has potential to have a Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams-type career as a pure scorer (but his opportunity might not be in Brooklyn due to being back on depth chart).  James Johnson is also an x-factor. He has been ass on bad teams but on good teams, when he doesn't need to do much, he has a tendency to do a lot of important things that don't show up on the stat sheet or at the very least be an enforcer on the team to give it grit&amp;grind.  Bembry is also a great player to have on the team even if he will barely play due to the culture, effort, and intangibles he brings to the team at practices, warmups and so on (Go watch Open gym and other videos on him - Raptors staff loved him because of how smart he was and how he was able to be used to practice schemes against opponents and give the younger guys some run).  This team is elite without Kyrie. Without Kyrie, I think a healthy Nets team is still the best in the East. With Kyrie, a healthy Nets team is a guaranteed chip. Health + Kyrie will be the x-factor for this team."
"Screwed? The have Patty Mills there along with James Harden, KD, Griffin and LMA. They're contenders without Kyrie."
"Good to have confirmation.  I pretty firmly believe that the Nets will be fine and should still be a top 3 favorite (health with determine a lot of that). Obviously their ceiling is lower without Irving, but with Patty Mills and Cam Thomas, and Jevon Carter, they have some solid PGs. Time will stell, but if you forced me to bet on a title team, I still might bet the Nets."
"Durant, Harden, Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Aldridge, Millsap, Griffin, plus a few other bench guys? I'd pick them in a heartbeat"
Patty Mills should start all the games. Kyrie 6th man.
This is just making the patty mills signing even better
"The thing is. The nets will still be amazing this year.  KD, Harden, Patty Mills, Griffin, Aldridge, Harris, Claxton, bruce brown, Cam Thomas (potential ROY candidate).   That’s a stacked squad already. Kyrie just makes that team the avengers. The real question is when playoff time comes and Kyrie can’t play home games, what do you do then?"
Who knew this would be the real reason the Patty Mills signing looks so good
They got so lucky with that patty mills pickup.
I legit think Patty Mills will be more useful in the playoffs than Westbrick
"this is a bad question because it doesnt impose a dilemma. literally any team would take patty mills for 6 million a season. Russ is questionable and only a select few teams make sense especially at that price tag, im not saying westbrook is a better player by any stretch btw."
I'll take Patty Mills and Giannis(39 million salary)
I'll take patty mills and use the extra $39 million cap space to sign a max player
"Every single team in the league would take Westbrook and his contract because he’s a superstar and on a completely different planet than Mills talent wise.  Talent wins games and championships, not “class” or whatever people use to hype up Patty Mills."
Patty Mills not even a single ponder
Patty Mills easy
"Patty Mills is better than Westbrook come playoff time, give me Mills"
I'd rather have Patty Mills play starter minutes than Russ
Luka got out scored by patty mills in Olympic medal game. Let's not cherry pick the stats
"I don't think there is any chance of that trade happening (or Kyrie being traded as all). But totally agree that Simmons would fit fine. He could also set picks and role to the rim for lobs and could play PF with LMA at Center because of LMA's shooting. He would improve the Nets defense and with KD, Harden, Patty Mills, Joe Harris, and LMA on the team, the offense is still going to get 120 a game."
"On the bright side, the Patty Mills signing looks better every day."
This reminds me of when Patty Mills and Aron Baynes came back to Australia with the championship trophy and crashed [this guys live spot](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7d/be/08/7dbe08b24e28709b7f3648ee6a41ad11.jpg). He had no fucking idea who they were while being a Fox sports reporter covering Aussie rules football.
Going to have Patty Mills interviews lull me to sleep tonight.
Patty Mills voice is so relaxing
bruh patty mills' voice - that's some real aussie shit
"Must be a delay, thought you meant to reaction to Patty Mills contesting!"
The Nets have Patty Mills!
Patty Mills
"Run the offense through Harden and KD and use Kyrie as a better backup PG than Patty Mills, or a spot up shooter when he’s playing off of Harden."
theyre much worse with a top 10 guard in the nba being replaced by  checks notes...  patty mills? nvm they chillin
"KD, Harden, Griffin, Aldridge, Millsap, Patty Mills, Joe Harris. I'm really praying for them to get through these tough times."
Patty Mills doing EVERYTHING
"I hope Patty Mills never retires from international play, especially since Simmons is such a big fucken disappointment"
FIBA Patty Mills is no joke
Patty Mills
PATTY MILLS
PATTY FUCKING MILLS SAY HIS NAME
i fucking love patty mills
Patty mills has black Air Force 1’s energy wearing the Aussie singlet
"Patty Mills cooling Thybulle down, mate, absolute leader, so happy for him to represent Australia"
Patty Mills is who Ben Simmons thinks he is. Absolute legend.
"Patty fuckin' Mills, ladies and gentlemen."
Someone needs to remind Patty Mills this is the Olympics and not NBA and he should return to his true form. Olympic Patty.
I like Rudy a lot for this spot. I hope we get him and maybe Patty Mills.
Because once Patty Mills puts on the green and gold he becomes an Avenger level threat
"Because they've been playing in that system for years. They may play in the NBA now, but growing up in their country they all played together in different age groups up to the national team for years. For example patty Mills has played for Australia since 2007, and Ricky Rubio with Spain since he was 17. They all know each other and their roles/system. Unlike the USA who puts a new squad out every couple of years with less than a month to figure it out."
Ever watched a Spurs game? Doesn't look like their offense to me. Patty Mills would see that and start laughing as he was picking it apart.
"Celtics will probably sign a starting PG for the MLE. Currently the only PGs on the roster are Smart, Pritchard, and Dunn, none of which I think are suitable starting PGs. Possible candidates are   - Patty Mills  - Reggie Jackson   - T.J. McConnell  - Derrick Rose  - Cam Payne  - Lonzo Ball in a S&amp;T  I don't really know what the FA market is gonna be like for any of these dudes tho so idk if the MLE is enough for them."
Patty Mills and Rudy Gay. Hope we bring back Fournier too
Patty Mills or Rudy Gay would be nice for the Nets
"Stevens is also looking at Patty Mills, I read today. They also picked up Richardson which I think is a good move."
I saw they are chasing Patty Mills. They also got Dunn. Are they just loading up on guards?
"So they are chasing Patty Mills, getting Dunn and getting Richardson. That's a lot of guards."
"So they are chasing Patty Mills, getting Dunn and getting Richardson. That's a lot of guards."
i feel like if i ever see patty mills in a boston green i will tear my eyes out.  those things  do not go together!
Yes.. you better roll the dice.. if you get olympics patty mills
I feel like everyone wants their teams to target Patty Mills
I got the Lakers on July 22 for $215 at +600 Fanduel pay out $1505   Knew they were going to add significant pieces and drop to like 2-1 but I never imagined getting Russell Westbrook!!! I was thinking Hield and Patty Mills.   My other bet I am going to make if the Pelicans get Lowry....  Zion for MVP at great odds. Yep I can see the Pelicans making #4 seed this year if they add Lowry and I've got Zion taking the MVP
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Patty Mills revenge game against Pop.
Patty Mills really carried Pop all these years.
"First Patty Mills leaves the Spurs and now the Boomers are lighting up Team USA, what a bad week for Coach Pop  At least he's got Jock now though"
They need the star power to take down patty mills and Joe ingles
"We really boutta lose to patty mills and company. God damn. A team with KD, devin booker, etc. Horrible coaching or what is it?"
He recruited patty mills
I know international play is way different but it’s wild that the best players on each team are Patty Mills and KD lmao
"It shouldnt be close, the fact fucking Patty Mills, Dellevadova and Joe Ingles are playing better than the guys we think are the best in the world is a joke"
Patty mills &gt; Jordan
Nice d on patty mills but too many forced shots for America
I'm not saying it's going to happen but if we have a bit of a lead and Patty Mills starts going Super Saiyan in the last quarter like he always does for Australia we could blow USA out.
"Dude shut the fuck about Patty Mills, he’s a great player but Australia is a great team with awesome players."
Winner from Olympic KD vs Olympic Patty Mills takes on the winner from Olympic Luka and Olympic Fournier for the gold medal
"Whatever happens, Patty Mills for OAM. Hell, make him PM."
"i'm not sure i understand why, patty mills isn't even a starter in the nba, why is the usa so bad"
Patty mills ain’t even started heating up yet
Chris Goulding is the Patty Mills of this team
Patty mills little bit off with his shots but I reckon it will click
"Listen to patty mills talk about playing for Australia and you’ll understand, I don’t think USA basketball has the same patriotism of a lot of other parts of their culture. Probably because they’ve been the best for so long and gold seemed like a formality but it’s clear to see"
Getting bodied by a team with continuity. Absolutely no excuse for a team of all-stars to get embarrassed by Patty Mills and Dante Exum lol
i'm sleeping *with* patty mills
Patty Mills is gonna be disgusting on Brooklyn.
Patty Mills stays fucking KD up
Patty Mills loves getting guarded by KD. Hunts him out.
"just started watching basketball this olympics, are these the top 5 guys in the nba  1. Kevin Durant  2. Luka Doncic  3. Patty Mills   4. Zoran Dragic  5. Dante Exum"
Except Patty Mills gets a +20% boost
Patty Mills isn’t even going to make it to the Nets if KD has anything to say about it
Jrue holiday has to stick to patty mills … anybody else and patty drives to the basket
Based on this olympics I think we can say that Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio are top 5 players next season in the NBA
Patty Mills you are a legend.
Holy shit the form on Patty Mills during the fall. Get that man into diving.
Some say Patty Mills is still sliding to this day
Bam is softer than soft. He let Rubio pack him then Patty Mills do that????
patty mills
If this was an anime the USA coach would have played with or coached MJ and when Patty Mills is dribbling it for a split second he'd see MJ.
"Who tf is this commentator. ""We don't expect stuff like this from Patty Mills?!"" You clearly haven't watched international basketball then"
"patty mills gonna drop 40 on KD and then look him dead in the eye like ""brooklyn is my team now"""
im excited to have patty mills and pop trash talk all game
##**It's Patty Mills time.**   Towel waving extraordinaire turned FIBA GOAT.
Prediction: Patty Mills with the buzzer beater 3 pts to win!
"If KD wins it tonight, does he have a chance to someday match Patty Mills' legacy?"
"If Patty Mills wins this game, is he considered the GOAT? Doncic logic"
"dont get too excited. every international player looks like a superstar in fiba games.  in the nba its a different game.  look rubio, patty mills for instance. or mike tobey for slovenia and he doesnt even play in the nba."
"The Nets easily got better with the addition of Patty Mills, whereas with the Lakers their fans are still debating on whether they got better or worse.  I'm sorry but I just don't see it, depth isn't too important in the playoffs anyway."
"With 3 rookies on roster and signing Patty Mills and James Johnson, the roster spot is probably more useful than anyone they could have gotten back"
"2014 NBA finals game 5, one win away from ring number 5.   Spurs coming from down 15 and end going on a 39-15 run behind the shooting of Patty Mills, Kawhi Leonard, capped off by all time dunk by Manu on Chris Bosh.    It was the ultimate revenge tour.   https://youtu.be/i1ANov-Ogvg"
"they lost demar, rudy gay and patty mills though"
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
"Everyone’s looking at the fair market value and saying this is wrong, which for most cases is true, but the model still identifies some of the bargains in the market. Sure, Kemba isn’t worth 26/yr but you cant say 8m/yr isn’t good value. Bobby Portis and Patty Mills were also good bargains.   A name missing I thought was good value is Cam Payne"
The Nets won I think. Lakers made nostalgic moves though I do like the addition of Monk. But the Nets made smart moves to solidify their already top position. The Patty Mills deal was perfect for them.
"Depends on what Sean Marks can do with Dinwiddie, I think. Stole Patty Mills, signed Blake, signed Bruce, got mini Tucker and 1st round pick in return of Shamet. Also most importantly, by patiently waiting to see Lowry and Lonzo to go somewhere, Dinwiddie’s value rose even more. Seems every team prefers Dinwiddie over Schroder now. Marks played all his cards perfect, and if he can dump DAJ along with Dinwiddie’s trade, he deserves every compliment."
"Bulls improved the most, Patty Mills to the Nets is the one who'll really impact the title."
KD will throw it as a signing bonus to Patty Mills?
"You know about FIBA Patty Mills, FIBA Frank and FIBA Ricky Rubio... but while those players rank in the NBA from very bad to solidly average... you have Luka Doncic who is an NBA MVP caliber player. And the thing is, he came up via EuroLeague where he was MVP before getting drafted. He has that same ""next gear"" as those other things when it comes to international play.   FIBA Luka is a thing.. and it's terrifying for everyone."
Patty Mills has left the San Antonio Spurs for the Brooklyn Nets  Ftfy
Why would you bring back Bryn Forbes but not Patty Mills? Why?
australian must be pissed with ben simmons rn. ben pick and roll/pop with jock or kick it out to FIBA patty mills and jingles paired with amazing defensive backourt pair of ben and thybulle should be enough to win a medal or even beat USA in gold medal match.
"Great for a vet min, but not a game changer. Some depth at least. Not exactly Patty Mills."
Olympic Rubio + Olympic patty mills for simmons? Who say no
"Fianlly, a genuine rebuild. Thanks for everything, Patty Mills! I will never forget his 3rd quarter threes against the '14 Heat."
&gt;They also added Patty Mills who can go off for 20 any night.  With this logic the Lakers have Monk/Nunn/Melo who can go off for 20 any night
No they haven't. The Nets big 3 alone was scoring nearly 90 points a game in the playoffs before injuries happened. They also added Patty Mills who can go off for 20 any night. The Lakers haven't come close to reducing the gap
Patty Mills.
"Four of their top seven scorers from last season are gone, and they are getting nothing in return for them.   The Spurs really fucked this up.   I understand that there would likely be no takers for Rudy Gay, and even at the beginning of the season, none for LMA.   But Patty Mills and DeMar are certainly guys they could have shipped out for something."
"A bunch of scrubs on vet minimums does not make you deep lmao. Patty Mills our 6th man is litterally better than anyone on your roster besides Lebron,AD and Westbrook"
"Seriously though what happened to Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen, Patty Mills? Wasn’t Pop the one who was broken up because he didn’t want to move George Hill in the Kawhi trade?  Pop drafted Dejounte, Lonnie Walker, Primo, and loves Keldon Johnson too"
They've got Patty Mills who has Aboriginal descent and also played for the Melbourne Tigers during that brief 2011 lockout.
"As a fellow Australian I would recommend not following the 76ers, at least not because of Simmons who’ll probably be gone, you can still just follow Australian players like Simmons when he’s traded or Patty Mills and Joe Ingles pursuing championships, also Jock Landale just signed with the Spurs which will be fun although I doubt he’ll play much. I’d recommended picking a team with a young star so your passion for the nba grows with that player, I think the Thunder would be a great choice for you personally, they have a great young star in Shai, just drafted an Australian (Josh Giddey) with the 6th pick, will likely suck for the next couple of years but will likely be pretty good for a while after that."
"Okay for real who tf is going to be left in San Antonio? Patty Mills was like the longest tenured Spur. Mills, Gay, DeRozan. Pop left to go do the Olympics and his team is all splitting up!"
"I mean sometimes sure.  But if I say Nikola Vucevic has an adjusted TS of 96 how am I supposed to prove that with evidence lol, just like sharing every video clip of him making or missing a shot all season  The problem with the eye test on reddit is that it's infallible, I can post objective data that says Patty Mills is a bad defender and if the response is ""well I watch the games and he isn't"" then I can't respond to it lmao.  It's just circular logic, saying ""my opinion is true because it is true"""
"Yeah but can you even name 4 Nets besides the big 3? Harris was great during the regular season, Griffin was last season’s shiny new toy and Patty Mills is this upcoming season’s, but their depth isn’t even mediocre. Lakers won’t have insane bench depth either but even average shooters for spacing is gonna have AD/LBJ/WB, AWestBron?, feasting."
Mills to the Nets is not good news. I am going to struggle to go for them even with Patty on the team.
They took patty Mills
"Damn, I was hoping to get Patty Mills but Kendrick isn’t bad"
For a title contender? Jae Crowder has been to back to back finals on two different teams and was prob the worst starter on both  An asset towards any team? Prob a solid bench player like a Patty Mills
"Kyries injury was fluke and Harden historically is not an injury prone player. Barring a freak accident I actually think it’s is likely they stay healthy, especially now with patty mills being able to reduce the load at guard"
Dang didn’t need to go so hard at Patty Mills!
"2016 Spurs  PG: Tony Parker / Andre Miller / Patty Mills SG: Manu Ginobili / Kevin Martin / Danny Green SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kyle Anderson / Rasual Butler PF: LaMarcus Aldridge / David West / Boris Diaw C: Tim Duncan / Boban Marjanovic / Matt Bonner  That’s one multi-MVP all-timer (Duncan)  A multi-DPOY and FMVP who can score 27 ppg and is a top-3 player in the playoffs (Kawhi)  Three multi All-NBA players (Ginobili, Parker, LMA)  One two-time all-star (West)  Three borderline all-stars (Andre Miller, Kevin Martin and Boris Diaw all had seasons where they were close to that level)  Two exceptional 3-and-D wings (Anderson and Danny Green)  For my money, this legitimately might be the best one ever. A starting lineup of All-NBA players plus that depth off the bench is just staggering. The weakest position is center but Duncan played nearly 40 MPG back then and LMA and West would be capable of filling in those minutes as well."
"They *can*, it's just that taking Kuzma+Trez would be an astronomically high tax bill for two mediocre players.   Look at it this way: Patty Mills signed for only like $6 million this season. The tax bill before that was $92.6 million. The tax bill now is $121.8 million (all of this according to Bobby Marks).  That's just on $6 million. Imagine now Kuzma+Trez making like $23 million combined..."

Other than missing out on Patty Mills I fail to see how we are a top 3 loser this free agency   I think Otto Porter and Nemanja Bejelica are two totally reasonable additions for the minimum even if they weren’t at the very top of our wish list and we haven’t even used our MLE yet
They probably would’ve won the chip this year if patty mills were on the team lol
"On paper maybe, idk at this stage of his career but for many years he’s actually reliable playoff minutes as opposed to shamet and Johnson. Mike James hasn’t done it yet but would be more in the mould for a Patty Mills type contributor."
Brooklyn’s only meaningful addition is patty mills
"I'd much rather have Patty Mills, Lonzo, and Graham. I don't think he's just as good as them because, for the most part, he is just a streaky shooter. He's not reliable on defense or for playmaking."
Patty Mills got 50 million dollars in 10(TEN) years played here. Seems cheap idk. and he holds a lot of spurs records and was essential on that 2014 team. Just say you dont know what youre talking about and move on   and his number is getting retired by us 100%
patty mills is good
"Days? Try minutes. After the Carushow left, we lost patty mills and rudy gay, you guys went hard at us. And fake fans were going hard at Pelinka."
Patty Mills
Yeah I'd see it as adding a non-Allstar the same way I see them adding Patty Mills despite being horrendously stacked with three superstars.
Patty Mills was a great addition for ya'll. Hope we meet in the Finals
"Plus picked up Patty Mills, who every team was fighting for."
Why didn't we get Patty Mills
people were really saying the nets get everyone when all they’ve done is sign patty mills lmao
"Literally like 90 minutes ago Patty Mills went to the Nets and I saw comments ""what is Rob Pelinka doing right now""   And god damn was he doing some shit"
If one gets injured they're still fine. It took two getting hurt. And even then they prob would've been fine if they had Patty Mills
"Honestly, a healthy big three of kd, harden, and kyrie is just so scary. It often feels like if you just surround them with average players there's no way they can lose or score less than 120 points. When you add good players its scary, and when you add good players that fit its damn near spooky. On blakes worst day he is still a bruiser. This patty mills signing is also huge. 48 minutes of harden, kyrie, mills handling the ball. This is one of the best teams created and they aren't done"
Is this thing on? Our tracker signed off after Patty Mills?
No bc he was never gonna go there unless he got paid. Russ’ trade deaded that. He might’ve influenced Patty Mills to sign elsewhere. But DeMar was never going to the Lakers once the trade happened on draft night.
"Harris had a bad series against the Bucks, it's not fair to say he's invisible in the playoffs based off that. Patty hasn't performed in big games for years now, he's great in the Olympics but not so much in the NBA. Harris is a better defender and cutter than Mills, and he lead the league in 3 point  % last year."
Luka overrated as fuck patty mills &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Luka
Would it be legal if Patty Mills wore an Australian Jersey under his NBA jersey
"Does anyone know where there was a comment recently summarising how close Australia has been to getting a medal and about Patty Mills being so close and ultimately how Ben Simmonds could have been the tipping factor for us to get a medal? It was in a post game thread possibly, or an article about Ben. I have been looking everywhere."
My brother said Patty Mills won’t play next olympics and I hope he’s wrong.
Patty Mills is on FIYA 🔥
"Patty Mills, he’s the best player in the world."
PATTY FKN MILLS
"Patty Mills is playing like Stephen Curry and Luka like Dingus Pingus, its over"
Is Patty Mills of African descent?
Patty mills &gt; curry
Patty mills 20+ and boomers win easy money baby
Patty Mills playing absolutely out of his skin
PATTY MILLS
Mavs were chasing all these other players when they should've when after Patty Mills.
"Patty mills, KD automatic"
Patty Fucking Mills
PATTY MILLS IS A MICROWAVE
"Hi, I'm new to basketball. Is Patty Mills the best player in basketball?"
Patty Australian of the Year Mills if he drags us over
PATTY MILLS
Patty god damn mills have my babies
Patty Mills is channeling his inner James Harden this game
Patty Mills doin his best Steph Curry impression.
Patty Mills wants that medal so bad.
Patty Mills wants that medal so bad. Is this his first time playing for his national team?

Patty mills &gt; kyrie
PATTY THE CUNT MILLS
Patty Mills is the fucking Energizer bunny - he's gonna run someone into the ground eventually.
Patty Mills too. Might not be too 5-7 but he’s up there
This game was great and all (not rlly) but I’m mainly looking forward to see Olympic Patty Mills versus Luka Doncic. That’s a matchup of two titans right there
That Batum shot may have been an even more BS 3 pointer than the ones Patty Mills had last week
Second best news -- right after you signed Patty Mills
Always jarring to see guys like fornier or patty mills kill it in international.
"I like this explanation. It's almost the same as if you just reverse the question and say ""Why is Louis Scola or Patty Mills an absolute beast in FIBA, but a so-so player in the NBA?"" Some styles just work better in some leagues.      We also shouldn't discount how much chemistry plays into the equation. The USA team changes like crazy, but it's not always the case with other FIBA teams who have a lot more experience playing together."
"Patty Mills signed for less, just an example. Maybe talk Danny Green into joining forces again with Kawhi. I don't know, but they'd have the options."
"Be a nets fan.  We have Patty Mills, whose an Aussie and possibly the greatest Aussie to play the game. Kyrie was born in Australia. Sean Marks, the GM, is from New Zealand."
FVV is basically a better version of Patty Mills I think
The San Antonio Spurs won a Championship with Patty Mills and Baynes. Also just signed Lonsdale.
"100%.  How can Ben Simmons think staying home and not joining his Olympic team is the right choice for his career and development?  You’ve got multiple players who were in the playoffs just as far, if not further, than him, and they made the trip across the globe to partake.  I can only imagine he’s the kind of guy that is salty about Patty Mills being a superstar during the Aussie’s run, instead of supporting his team."
Same with Patty Mills.  Pop got the taste of his own medecine.
This dude said the Nets were out on Patty Mills like a day before he picked the Nets so this is good news to me
"Nets will have KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, and JJ Reddick as their shooters. Lakers will have size, and they will outrebound the Nets like crazy, but the Nets' advantage in their 3 point shooting will be unfair."
I think Australia. Slovenia looked broken after the semifinal's dramatic finish. This is the last chance for a medal for a Patty Mills and his generation. They will let everything on the court. The Slovenians did that yesterday.
"Patty Mills paid for his crimes against the Warriors in the semifinals, Batum about to pay for spurning us too 😤"
BECAUSE WE CLEARLY AREN'T GETTING PATTY MILLS :\*(
Cam Thomas is going to be a great player from day 1. He’ll probably lead ur bench unit alongside Patty Mills.
Love me some Patty Mills.
God gave us Aussies Patty Mills and Joe Ingles in the likeability stakes and the price we had to pay was Ben Simmons.
"tbf International ball is completely different. Rubio, Patty Mills, and Luis Scola are amazing FIBA players but just alright NBA players   Too many times we've been fooled by dominant FIBA performances and thinking that player will have dominate the following year in the NBA when in fact an nba player going off in a World Cup or Eurobasket has no impact on them translating that over to their NBA season.   Rubio will be dominant and lead Spain to a gold in the World Cup or EuroBasket and its not like he goes into the next NBA season a different player  Fournier is who he is as a player at this point. Decent offensive combo guard and a poor defender"
"&gt; Nets - Mills **Harris** Brown Claxton  Joe Harris? He's not coming off the bench.  Right now the only guys who seem to have guaranteed rotation minutes off the bench are Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton.   I would not put the Nets in the top 5."
"He’s now got us Aussies for the Bronze, a team that has run 4th soo many times it’s our mission to win our first medal in Olympic Men’s Basketball for Patty Mills.  Thybulle is going to trying to lock his ass down from the time he wakes up in his bed to the time he hits the court."
"KD was basically a 5x better player than Patty Mills (Australia's best player), that's all you need to know. You basically make a super coordinated 6""10 with a long wingspan and agility from a lab. He was a leader of the USA team since 2012. He's the greatest FIBA player of all time and he's the USA's hero"
"&gt;USA's Gregg Popovich on exchange w/ Australia's Patty Mills: ""I'm thrilled with the victory, obviously. When I looked him in the eyes, I felt bad. They have great camaraderie, history and culture. They want it just as badly as us. That was a little bit sad... We all try to win.""  This is really relatable for me. Obviously, I'm just watching at home, but I do feel bad when a team/athlete loses at the Olympics even if I wasn't rooting for them."
"I would counter that with the heat signing PJ Tucker, the Nets signing patty mills and the bucks retaining Bobby Portis. Would you consider those teams well run?"
I convinced the game plan was pray for a Patty Mills takeover
The offense has always struggled w/o Steph. I’ve more faith in the offense treading water with Simmons running things while Steph sits than anything they have on the roster now. Losing patty mills to Brooklyn hurt
"No patty mills, it’s not that funny if everyone says this."
Patty Mills caught every bite of the meal on both ends of the floor last night
Because the original HEB spurs squad was way before Patty Mills. Why is that confusing?
"You do realize there's a difference between going into the luxury tax vs being in the luxury tax for so long the repeater is a lot bigger of a cost than on the surface? Signing a player with the full TPMLE is essentially signing a player for $20-25 million due to the repeater. The only players they viewed worth spending that amount for were Patty Mills and Nic Batum who aren't available anymore.   If anything, they will at most use part of the TPMLE but there aren't many available FAs that are worth it for the full thing"
It’s a nickname for Patty Mills. He got that nickname because he plays much better in international competition than in the NBA
"2012/2013 Spurs:  Duncan  Parker  Ginobili  Kawhi  McGrady  and, of course...Patty  Mills"
It's a nickname for Patty Mills. He plays way better in international competition than in the NBA which is why he got that nickname

"Yeah, but I really expect that to change after this year’s playoffs. Even more so now that they got Patty Mills."
patty should excel here..we know the big 3 takin nights off occasionally and dinwiddie gone..mills should see a big role as a 6th man here
Brooklyn’s own Patty Mills
"Patty Mills, Monk, Batum and a lot of other players would've been great fits with PHI but not one report that they were in the running.  Maybe the local writers had the info and we at r/nba just aren't aware of it."
"International patty mills &gt; Kd, harden, Kyrie"
No but it might have had something to do with Rudy Gay and Patty Mills 🤷🏽‍♂️
Patty Mills a good signing for the Nets
"Yeah but Patty Mills been putting up good stat lines in the Olympics, so he's now the new KD."
Finals gonna be Monk and Bazemore vs Patty Mills and DJ
Patty Mills to the Nets!
Does Patty Mills being consistent matter at all when they can just sub Kyrie back in if he's not throwing fucking daggers?
Patty Mills wants to play with the best player in the league
Patty Mills is better
Patty Mills &gt;&gt;&gt;
They got their patty mills counter
LOL FUCK PATTY MILLS
Patty Mills
This probably means no Patty Mills
It isn't that Patty Mills is some goated star. Nets have all 5 of the top catch and shoot players from last season now.
No Patty Mills is the one who had the netting
Lol y’all saying this over Patty Mills
"If people think you're the favorites, they'll hype anything you do. This would be the reaction if they got Rudy Gay as well, but since Rudy went to the Jazz he's not MVP caliber like Patty Mills suddenly is."
"Nice of you to think of me but no , I didn't coach patty Mills"
High: got Otto porter for the minimum   Low: nic batum flaked on us :(  Edit: and now patty mills too FUCK
Bruh imagine being a bazingalojillionaire and spending 30m on patty mills.
DeRozan would’ve been a poor fit  They could’ve used Patty Mills for sure though.
Is patty mills a bum?
Patty Mills isn't that consistent. Y'all must think FIBA Mills is what he's like in the NBA lol.
My projections  *  Kawhi Leonard (LAC) * Demar Derozan (DAL) * Dennis Scrotum (OKC) * Spencer Dinwiddie (WAS) * John Collins (ATL) * Josh Hart (NOP) * Victor Oladipo (BOS) * Danny Green (LAL) * Andre Iguodala (GSW) * Patty Mills (SAS) * Reggie Jackson (LAC)
Fr bro why does a backcourt need Kyrie when you have Patty Mills and Harden
Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
"We need more shooting. If not Reggie, I would love to have Patty Mills as a backup."
"We’re not done adding shooters 😏. Just waiting on Patty Mills on the TPMLE, and Daddy Myers is gonna get something going to get Ingles too. Golden State is going to be sniper central."
Patty Mills is Marmite Jordan
"Haha yeah, I’m waiting for the Lakers to fill their roster. I’m hoping we can get Patty Mills and another decent wing, I’ll take Danny Green back any day."
Locking in 2 more games means Patty Mills will crack top 10 all time for Olympic scoring.  He'll likely be at 7th after this Olympics.  Assuming he comes back in 2024 (he'll be 35) he will likely move into 4th place all time.
Patty mills is the one to get
Kangaroo Patty Mills is different 😳
I know I’m nitpicking but your post implied still trading Ben and I’m absolutely not advocating for that. You sign and trade Mills to ADD him to Simmons. Nobody in their right mind is sending Simmons out in a S&amp;T Patty Mills.   Sixers are fine keeping the band together and just adding a Ringo.
Patty Mills to the Bucks  pls
"Death, taxes and patty mills turning into prime MJ in international games."
"You may have seen the news but the Warriors signed Nemanja Bjelica.   So now they just need to land Patty Mills and boom, successful off season. Some great draft picks, some nice veterans, if Klay looks like Klay by the end of the season (a big if, I know) then this roster has a chance at making the finals."
lol they'll get patty mills and bertans or kuzma. maybe even hield
"Yup. Just saw that. Works out if we can use the MLE on someone like Patty Mills, Millsap or maybe Dipo."
"If the Sixers sign and trade for Patty Mills and run back the same core of Simmons, Harris, Embiid, I think they solved all of their problems from the last playoffs by adding a secondary ball handler to initiate the half court."
"People had the same types of conversations about the Bucks before they put it all together this year. The Sixers choked in the playoffs, no doubt, but adding a secondary ball handler to initiate in the half court solves all of the Sixers problems, IMO.    Hoping for a Sign and Trade with SAS for Patty Mills."
Wait. a Rudy Gobert type role? Patty Mills? They could not be more different players. How is Pop holding him back from this? Pop cant prevent Patty from growing a foot taller.
Patty Mills is probably the last big name left that the Lakers could realistically land
Patty Mills is a really small name. Well below average. Does he have a long middle name or something?
*so we can focus on Patty Mills
Damn the lakers better have Patty mills lined up for their mini MLE. They obviously didn’t offer it to gay since he took the same money in Utah
Patty Mills is definitely worth the MLE.  I don't want to touch Drummond with a ten foot pole lol.
its gonna be patty mills or drummond lol
"Yeah, I can see why though. I think we need Mills more than Gay. We have Ariza, Bazemore and possibly Melo coming. Hopefully Patty comes through."
"Lmao the off-season isn’t even over so you can’t say anyone had a good or bad offseason until the smoke settles. The Lakers have been linked to Patty Mills, Melo, and Rudy Gay so to say the Lakers are done after signing 2 shooters is you being willfully dense and ignorant lmao"
"It depends on demar, but if he walks, The Spurs were all ready a 10 seed and had a losing record, I struggle to see how swapping demar/Rudy gay/Patty mills for Doug McDermott/Luka Samanic/and Tre Jones or josh primo doesn’t make this team quite a bit worse. And Derrick white, who just cannot stay healthy gets hurt again, this is probably a bottom 5 team"
"I swear to God if we (USA) don’t clamp Patty Mills. Just let everyone else get theirs, Im not tryna see this man turn into MJ in front of our eyes."
Bruh just gimme Melo and a lightly used Patty Mills and I'll be able to delude myself into believing that this roster actually makes sense
"As much as it pains me to admit, if I just enjoyed basketball I'd watch women's basketball. The media makes a difference and I enjoy watching players I ""know."" Patty mills for example. If Australia was a bunch of people I didnt know it wouldn't have been nearly as fun to watch."
"All about your role. A guy like Patty Mills has a much bigger role for Australia. He has the ball in his hands all day and has the green light, while on the spurs he has a smaller role."
PLEASE WE NEED RUDY GAY AND KING PATTY MILLS

Patty Mills must have the highest approval rating in Australia right?
There is still a substantial gap in talent. There is no excuse for a coach to allow team USA to be dominated by the likes of patty mills and Evan Fournier.
&gt;Patty Mills has averaged 28.5 ppg against USA in their last 4 meetings and Australia is on a two game winning streak vs USA  This is what is keeping me going till Thursday
