"I wonder who has the right opinion, someone who judges wings by the first half of the season or someone who gives them time to develop into the player they will be. Anthony Edwards was definitely not the right pick for MN. But wings take a long time to develop, the majority of the good wings you see today started off with bad efficiency and as raw prospects. Come back to me in 3 years and we will see if he was a bust or not.  And none of those aforementioned players have ever had to go straight into a season with no training camp, no shootarounds, and 2 coaches in 30 days. Im sorry but your take not only exposes your level of NBA knowledge, but it also exposes that you haven't watched basketball for more than 2 years. Ive seen Tyreke Evans go from star to bust, and seen kawhi turn from a defensive-oriented wing to an all-around stud. I know better than to give up on Anthony Edwards. Please take your negativity to a different source.  Also on a tangent, Deandre Ayton got similar treatment when luka and trae broke out, I think you and I both know Ayton still has monster potential.   TL: DR Stop being a doomer"
"Deandre Ayton. I don’t wanna move him, but I’m curious as to how his value is perceived by other fan bases."
"DeAndre Ayton yelled ""AND FUCKING ONE"" the night before and didn't get a tech."
"Chris Paul is amazing and very important to the team just by virtue of being really fucking good, but the Suns are *not* being carried by him. We're good because we have 2 elite offensive creators and 12 other guys who can play team defense and shoot. Also Deandre Ayton for whatever that's worth."
"DeAndre Ayton was abused down the stretch vs the Nets, Ive never seen a 1st round pick big man like him get absolutely neutralized like that. Harden picked up on him deliberately  Jeff Green and other smaller players were easily boxing him out for boards under the rim and he couldn't get any lift to get his hands on the ball once, nor did he take advantage of any size mismatch he had under the rim. Players were driving right at him at the end of the game, and he was even more ineffective on offense"
"I mean no ones asking him to completely shut them down. Just make their jobs harder, and he hasn’t done that. Tbh Deandre ayton has impressed me far more defensively in the games I’ve watched this year. Wayyy better at switching on to the perimeter and actually made life difficult for jokic when they faced off."
Good point lol. Thought Miller should’ve been fired after the team with Deandre Ayton lost to Buffalo in the first round
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
Deandre Ayton did a pretty good job
&gt; except Robin  And Deandre Ayton.
I mean I watched it and she said that deandre ayton took a big step forward in his career when he has statistically regressed and not only that the Suns didn’t play him at all in the 4th quarter tonight
"Lmao the mental image of Ayton trying to D up Booker, with CP3 screaming at him like he's DeAndre Jordan."
Deandre ayton is a frustrating man. But boy can he dance
Deandre “And Fucking One” Ayton

DeAndre Ayton 'bout to be looking like Shaq out there.
"This makes the most sense of all the theories, I guess beyond just dumb luck and bad ownership in the east.   But...I feel like if that was the case, most very good western conference teams would have been built through the draft. Looking at the current western conference playoff teams, the only ones that seem to be benefiting from recent high draft picks are the Lakers (who trade a bunch of recent high draft picks for AD), and the Suns (though Deandre Ayton is their 3rd best player). No other team has a top 5 overall pick that they drafted themselves.   I know that's a very cursory analysis but it seems like there has to be more to it than just draft position, no?"
Deandre Ayton and Deandre Ayton's draft profile.
Cam Johnson and Deandre Ayton were sensational in the 4th.
Deandre Ayton
"We must view basketball through much different lenses then. Some examples of bigs that I believe guard switches well are Gobert, Bam, Jarrett Allen, Al Horford, DeAndre Ayton."
"&gt; He’s shooting a league average TS% despite being a poor FT shooter who doesn’t shoot many FT’s per game. That’s a good thing.  How is being bad at getting to the line not a bad thing? Deandre Ayton is also terrible at getting to the line (even worse than Wiggins) so I don't go around bragging that Ayton very efficient especially if you consider he can't get to the line. Luka Doncic and Trae Young ability to get to the line help their TS% greatly but we don't go around and say ""well they get to the line a lot so it shouldn't be factored"". Wiggins inability to get to the line is on him.  &gt;And yes, shooting 1% than his career high is a big improvement  No it is not. Shooting 1% higher than your career high, or 2-3% higher than your career average can often just be statistical noise and the general variance year to year. Also considering the fact that he is playing with the best PG of this generation, I would have actually expected a much bigger jump.   &gt;Wiggins’s TS% was under 52% in 3/5 seasons.  Ya because he was on teams with low gravity and he was 19 or 20 years old on two of those season.  &gt;Draymond could shoot 40% from 3 this year and you would say he hasn’t shown a big improvement with your logic because that only beats his career high 5 years ago by 1%  That would be an 8% jump from his career average. That is equivalent to 12% increase in true shooting from his career average. Not 2% like Wiggins.  &gt;Saying someone’s efficiency sucks because he misses half point per game on FT% is just dumb and clearly shows you have an agenda to pus  The only agenda I have against is stupidity."
PG: Ja Morant  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Tatum  PF: John Collins  C: Deandre Ayton  6th man: Clarkson

"I can understand the DeAndre Ayton pick, but the Bagley one..."
"3 factors: Chris Paul being a leader, DBook no longer having to worry about being doubled every play now, Deandre Ayton not being suspended for the beginning of the season like last year"
Deandre Ayton:   :(
"Doncic is the epitomin of modern basketball. He was MVP in the second best League in the world at 19. Playing proffesionaly since being 15. It was a no brainer that you should take the kid 1st unless there is a Lebron, Jordan or Anthony Davis in the draft.  There is no reason to take a decent prospect at the ""least"" valuable position today and not take the best prospect available since ever.  You can somehow argue Hakeem over Jordan. Iverson over Kobe. Harden over Curry. But there is absolutely no argument for Ayton over Doncic. Most draft ""experts"" put DeAndre at 1st because they knew the connection with the Suns owner and his intentions to pick him first. It was ""cheap"" win that they predicted the 1st, so that they can advertised themselfs as experts .."
"Yeah I can’t say that I saw a lot of that honestly, I would say that the majority of well know NBA writers had the Suns in the playoffs in their predictions.   Adding Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul to a team that was already close to the playoffs was a pretty easy prediction."
"Yet he has/had his career highs against Utah, Philly, Phoenix, and Boston, all teams with trash big men like Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid (2x), Deandre Ayton, Al Horford"
"nash, booker, barkley, marion, stoudemire  Honerable mention: Deandre Ayton will probably be that center when its all said and done but he's not there yet."
Deandre Ayton over Doncic?  If oden or Sam Bowie never happened I’d totally talk shit about that:)
"Since were without Nurkic right now, Deandre Ayton scares me. Kanter has been playing his heart out and seems more aggressive lately but I’m worried about Ayton just feasting in the paint."
He's looked 32 since he was a rookie  DeAndre Ayton has looked 40 since he was in college
"""Quote all the stats you want, I have my biases and don't care whether my anecdotal points are based on fact or just narrative and personal preference cause I can't find tangible evidence why Booker is better than Lavine. I also won't accept any other evidence because I have no answer for them and i'll resort to ""shaq tautology"" of ""ringz erneh"" - IsnautIgor that's what you sound like lol  The Suns were 26-39 (13th seed) last season before the bubble hot streak btw lol they were going nowhere until they brought in help in CP3, Deandre Ayton, Jae Crowder and the improvement of Mikal Bridges. Lavine has never played with anyone even close to the caliber of CP3, a guy who brought a team thats supposed to be tanking to the playoffs.... so you tell me who's the main reason the Suns are doing well this season lol"
DeAndre Ayton gonna lead Bahamas to Gold
On Tuesday he called Deandre Ayton Andre Ayton lol.
"Suns  2011: 13 markieff Morris  2012: 13 Kendall Marshall  2013: 5 Alex Len  2014: 14 tj warren, 18 James ennis   2015: 13 Devin booker  2016 4 dragon bender, 13 Georgia’s papagiannis  + 2nd round pick bogdon bogdanovic traded for 8 marquess chriss  2017 4 josh Jackson  2018: 1 Deandre ayton, 16 zhaire smith  2019: 6 Jarrett culver traded for saric + 11 cam johnson   2020: 10 Jalen smith"
Deandre Ayton on an island 1v1 vs Harden multiple times down the stretch... yeah that’s not gonna cut it
34 year old Jeff Green won a clutch tip-off against Deandre Ayton. That was the ball game.
"HARDEN  I have to hate the Nets, but I like Harden and love that he's gettin the appreciating he deserves  On a flip note; is it just me or from watching the game with the Nets playing no big men, is DeAndre Ayton the most ineffectual &amp; invisible player on the court?"
Sun's are so scared of Harden iso on Deandre Ayton they double him and give Jeff Green a pretty wide open layup. Joe Harris hustle closeout leads to a miss. Harden comes down and nails a 3. Nets first lead of the game. I ain't even a Nets fan but games like this are why you watch basketball.
I had a Cavs fan friend get into a legitimate argument with me that Andre Drummond is better than Deandre Ayton. Drummond fucking sucks and looking at raw stats proves absolutely nothing.

" No, I believe that was his first match up. Jokic rook’d Deandre hard. Ayton has actually played well against Jokic since."
I just want to say that what Deandre Ayton does is extremely important to this team. His defense is outstanding and he has sacrificed his offense for the betterment of the team. He consistently grabs timely rebounds and is always where he needs to be.
Deandre Ayton is jacked AF and he’s good at the line
DeAndre Ayton is as soft as Jokic looks.
Dario Saric is legitimately better than Deandre Ayton
"Suns fans here, I think Ayton need more aggressive when he play with Gobert, from the data below:  [https://www.landofbasketball.com/games\_between/deandre\_ayton\_vs\_rudy\_gobert.htm](https://www.landofbasketball.com/games_between/deandre_ayton_vs_rudy_gobert.htm)"
"25 games in, we knew that Luka was going to be better than DeAndre Ayton.   Feels like it's a similar story here."
incidental? Ayton consistency racks up fouls for players flopping whenever he sets a screen or tries to fight through screens. I agree that it was a good no call but Jesus the league is inconsistent with what's a foul and what's not. I'm just convinced the refs hate Deandre Ayton.
deandre ayton wears oven mitts to games
Hahaha starts ? look at how Deandre Ayton was juicing in his sophomore year and he's not as big as Zion
I need someone to explain to me how anthony Edwards right now is better then deandre ayton

"I can't really give you a reason for a specific game, I would have to watch that game. Was Valanciunas playing? He's usually going to grab more rebounds than then opposing center. Tillmann has also proven to be a good rebounder and Gorgui Dieng is an important part of the rotation. Not that many teams play three centers on a regular basis. But other teams with a strong frontcourt still fare well on the rebound department. Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner combined for 24 rebounds in their win over the Grizzlies. Keldon Johnson of the Spurs had 10, DeAndre Ayton 16. Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons combined for 34 rebounds against them... These are just a few games played in January.  The Grizzlies actually rank 15h in rebounds per game and 16th in opponents rebounds per game, that's average. Here and there you're always going to find stretches where other team's bigs or in general aren't going to rebound as much."
"Holy fuck, why does Deandre Ayton never get to the line? It's infuriating to look at the box score and see him taking 2 free throws all game."

"Better: DeAndre Ayton- people look at his stats and probably think he’s having a down year, but he’s become the anchor of our defense and the reason why we never get completely killed on the boards. Also in the previous two years DA relied on plays being ran for him in order for him to make an offensive impact, but this year he’s getting most of his points recently just off his hustle and effort alone.   Worse: Devin Booker- now due to his play recently this is most likely going to change but Devin had a lot of growing pains to start the season. His play struggled mainly because he didn’t know where he was within this new team with big expectations. He struggled learning how to play within good players and when he needed to play hero ball. Often times he would either be too passive or too aggressive. Couple that with his major regression from the free throw line and turnover problem Suns fans were genuinely concerned. But it looks like he’s starting to figure it all out."
He looks younger than Deandre Ayton.
Deandre Ayton to Boston confirmed. Source: some guy on 4chan whose girlfriend goes to another school
Deandre Ayton and Greg Oden disagree
"I agree on Mourning, but I think you're way off on Ewing. I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that Ewing was above average at essentially every big man skill. Great floor spacer, great ft shooter (for a big), good handle for a big, ability to score on the block and from mid range. Imagine a DeAndre Ayton who has fully realized/maximized his potential, and who welcomes the pressure of stardom. Ewing would have flourished in this era."
DeAndre Ayton is 20 going on 82.
"his mobility is overstated, he’s mobile like Amare Stoudemire not close to like how Bam Adebayo or Deandre Ayton are"
Who Ayton won if it was a face off between Deandre and Joey Chesnut?
"This is crazy. Luka is averaging 27/9/9 carrying his team. Ayton is what, the third or fourth best on his team depending how high on bridges you are. Swap those 2 and see what happens. Mavs become one of the bottom 3 teams in the league and the Suns would be much better. It blows me away anyone thinks Ayton should’ve been drafted first. Y’all really think when there’s a minute left  and ayton has to make a play on AD or Embiid he’s gonna go from “afraid with the ball” to killer when he’s shown a passivity for shooting and nothing more than 10 ft range. Basically, I’m saying is Luka is a future MVP and multi-time champion and Deandre is a younger, cooler Andre Drummond."

Deandre Ayton is now Ayton-1 against the mavs.
"It's wild, to me, to see how many international players are popping up in the league from countries I didn't really expect to see have NBA players. Rui and Yuta from Japan, Markkanen from Finland, Buddy Hield and DeAndre Ayton from Bahamas. The list goes on."
"""Chuck, if Rudy Gobert gets 200 million, how much does DeAndre Ayton get?"""
"Deandre Ayton, then add a bunch of strength, girth, some athleticism, and some post moves(but take away the jumper). And Shaq is prob an inch taller and way more aggressive. Faster than ayton too"
"Fuck it.   Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton"
"Guarding Jokic is a team game. Dont think there's anybody who can defend him the entire game at the moment. the best I've seen this year is Deandre Ayton and Jokic still dropped 31 pts and 29 pts both games.

Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokić - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vučević - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valančiūnas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics

Why isn’t Wilt alive? Is DeAndre Ayton next?
Deandre Ayton
Deandre Ayton
I can see SGA over Trae.   But Deandre Ayton would be about the 7 pick.
Deandre Ayton got the fire edibles.
"Lu Dort  Hear me out before downvoting. He's definitely a great contract value but I see as many or more posts/highlights for him than guys like Victor Oladipo, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, KAT, DeAndre Ayton, De'Aaron Fox, etc."

DeAndre Ayton looks 50 years old rn
"The 22, 50 year old Deandre Ayton"
Deandre Ayton I love you (check my username) but that beard needs some work.
Deandre Ayton MVP
Im pretty sure he’s not. The dudes had freakish athleticism since he was a rookie and even if he gets old  and his quickness deteriorates. He’ll still have enough power at 6’8” to be able to dunk. Im sure the league does mandatory drug test for example john collins and deandre ayton

"I'm not even trying to be biassed towards anyone. Let's take a look at Rockets previous 5 games and see what the bigs have done against them:  * LA Lakers: Anthony Davis has 19 pts, 10 reb, 5 blk, 2 ast, 7/8 shooting * San Antonio Spurs: Aldridge has 11 pts, 2 reb, 1 ast, 4/10 shooting * San Antonio Spurs: Aldridge has 4 pts, 2 reb, 2 ast, 2/7 shooting * Chicago Bulls: Markannen has 18 pts, 7 reb, 2 stl, 5/12 shooting * Phoenix Suns: Deandre Ayton has 26 pts, 17 reb, 5 blks, 3 ast, 11/15 shooting  If you guys aren't gelling yet defensively, surely someone else would've gone off.   Anyways, good luck for the rest of the season."

The Rockets just lost to Deandre Ayton
Deandre ayton looks like he just traveled to the present from the year 1968
Deandre Ayton is my dad!

"A case could be made for DeAndre ayton.  He was trending toward looking like a max player , cant imagine he's happy averaging 13 ppg in the year leading up to when he's eligible for an extension"
Usually when your talking about where an NBA player came from its there college bud. The stat line doesn't say DeAndre Ayton from the Bahamas it says DeAndre Ayton from the University of Arizona. Just sayin
"OP you murdered Arizona Basketball. Sean Elliot all time? Are you forgetting about Andre Iguodala , Gilbert Arenas. Shoot DeAndre Ayton was drafted a couple years ago and is far more talented then Sean Elliot ever was."
"Jerami Grant (didn’t think he’d handle the higher usage)  Julius Randle (I think last year was just a down year because he looked really good in Nola, but Impressed with his consistency so far and decision making)  Blake Griffin (surprisingly terrible, the heat game tells it all)   KD (didn’t think he’d still be this good I can’t lie lmao)   DeAndre Hunter (he’s gotten comfortable and looks like a legit high level 2-way (not just 3 and D) piece for the hawks)   DeAndre Ayton ( I really though he would look All-NBA caliber this year, haven’t given up hope at all though he’s still good)"
Of course they do lol  Do you think DeAndre Ayton as a rookie was the only one taking PEDs?  Even he didn't really get caught since it was just a diuretic. That alone should be enough evidence that most people are using steroids. They don't even have random drug tests.
"Of course it is, and of course is common, in 2019 a  sophomore ayton and collins popped up, however there wasn't too much media. [here's an article about it](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/11/5/20949723/nba-ped-suspensions-deandre-ayton-wilson-chandler-john-collins-steroids-banned-substances)"
"You really going out here disparaging Jaren as hard as you can. You haven't even acknowledged the rest of my comment, and a simple google search or watching a game would show that he is elite defensively, but fouls often. The reason he doesn't rebound is because he doesn't need to, as I said. He excels as a shot blocker, and a transition / perimeter offensive threat. He's got great handles, finishes ~70% at the rim and 40% from three, both on above average attempts, and a 5% block rate. In comparison, Rudy Gobert, one of the best shot blockers in the game, has a career high of 7%. He can defend, both perimeter and interior, and runs the floor. You comparing him to Steve Novak and Andrea Bargnani, one-dimensional players, doesn't do any justice when you think about the impact that Jaren really has. 2 DWS in the past season, and a neutral defensive box plus minus isn't exactly an insane net negative on the court. You just need to stop looking at him through shit-covered lenses and realise that he's a good player, and that his role is different to Deandre Ayton, Kristaps Porzingis or any other big man in the league. He isn't just tall and shoots 3's, he's a versatile perimeter and interior defender, and an offensive threat wherever he is."
"Jaren plays on the perimeter / outside the paint throughout the game. Plus, there's no need for him to rebound because Jonas is on the floor with him, and he can run in transition where he's deadly. If you want rebounding, you look towards static paint bigs, like Deandre Ayton or Steven Adams, but Jaren is a mobile four who runs the court as a perimeter threat, and goes for blocks and loose balls due to the Grizzlies' 2 big lineup with Jonas. He'll learn to stop fouling, but he can rebound and defend well. Just watch the games (which I assume you don't) to look at his impact, instead of relying on statistics which often don't tell the whole story, because if we relied on statistics, Steph Curry right now is an inefficient chucker and offensive liability."
"It’s his second personality from this [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/deandre-ayton-portrays-different-characters-different-times-thanks-part-green-goblin-211206976.html)  Deandre Ayton walked onto the Arizona Wildcats’ charter flight and immediately was greeted by boosters and fans.  “Hey, Deandre, have a good weekend,” a booster said.  Ayton looked at him quizzically.  “I don’t know who you are talking about, this Deandre,” he said with a Spanish lilt. “I’m Alejandro.”"
I own both a Ja Morant and Deandre Ayton jersey so I'm feeling pretty good rn.
"DeAndre Ayton I think. If the Suns aren’t going to give him the touches and green light that he should have to develop, he should go elsewhere"
"deandre ayton, cameron payne."
the nba would **never** catch lebron juicing. it would cost them far too much money by damaging the brand. they have no problem catching deandre ayton though
John Collins and DeAndre Ayton.   They both got 25 game suspensions last year.
"DeAndre Ayton for sure. I thought CP3 would help unlock his offense, but he looks like he's taken a step backwards."
"Suns I got Chris paul, devin booker, deandre ayton. They're a decent team this season it's my memory that is trash"

Like the interview of Deandre Ayton talking about Boban. So cute and hilarious
If deandre Ayton can get to the offensive level he was last year then it might be closer between him and Bam. His start has been kind of disappointing this season despite how good the Suns have looked
1. DeAndre Ayton  2. Bam Adabeyo  3. James Wiseman  4. Mitchell Robinson  5. Jarrett Allen  6. Wendall Carter  *Onyeka Okongwu( Way to early to tell)
"My list on *expected whole career value*, but disagreements welcome:  1. Bam Adebeyo 2. DeAndre Ayton (but not currently this high) 3. Jarrett Allen 4. James Wiseman (too early to really know but his flashes are balanced by his decision making) 5. Wendall Carter Jr 6. Onyeka Okongwu (too early to really know) 7. Mitchell Robinson (I'm kind of low on him and think he's already peaked)"
"Im gonng go with Cj mccollum, ik its a bad time to do it but hes streaky, hes on the high end of his streak rn, hes a ball hog with tunnel vision. Seems to have it out for and blue balls the players that threaten his number 2 spot.   Also probably deandre ayton"
"The draft order is tied to salary numbers, and not all #1 picks are created equally. You would have to do some pretty serious gymnastics to fix rookie contracts, like allow a player to shop for contracts if they don't like what their selecting team offers.       For example, Lebron james was a #1 pick and Deandre Ayton was a #1 pick. I know which one was worth 25m a year in their first year and which one was...not."
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
Yes I think Deandre Ayton and nets would be good too
Whatever Charlotte PG you think is worse between Ball and Graham   Jrue Holiday   Mikal Bridges   Tobias Harris   DeAndre Ayton
"Lol I’m not gonna get into this pointless argument with you about the difference between good and really fucking good. Maybe watch some Deandre Ayton defensive highlights from last season and this season, and stop with the lazy Ben Golliver-esque takes."
DeAndre Ayton tier.
I gave away Pascal and Deandre Ayton for Jayson Tatum. Fuck me
"Weird question, but are you a gamer as well? Ps5/Xbox series x, PC? Is anyone on your team into online gaming? I’m a big suns fan and Devin booker and Deandre Ayton are big gamers, you look like you can be a sniper in call of duty.   Also, last thing... please tell deandre Ayton to dunk the ball when you  play against us, or maybe after the game let him know that he’s 7 feet tall and it’s ok to do so."
Steven Adams? Deandre Ayton?
"Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton, poor man's addition"
"Great writeup. I dunno what the fuck Deandre Ayton was doing on that last play. It looked like he completely checked out. That literally isn't even defence lmfao, he was just walking backwards. He didn't help on the drive and did nothing to stop Sabonis, either."

"Deandre Ayton was the first overall pick three years ago. Teams still value Centers, even if Reddit doesn’t."
"If a center is good perimeter defense they are good at lateral quickness and keeping up with fast guys as well as defensive basketball IQ knowing when to switch/rotate. If someone is good at that and they are a center, unless they are like 6'8"" they will also likely be good at rim protection as well. This is why I was very confident that Deandre Ayton would develop defensively because he was good at perimeter defense early on but developed all aspects of defense as he went on."
"Deandre Ayton.   Dude doesn’t get talked about at all. Luka &amp; Trey are the superior talents right now, but this guy went 1st in the same draft and I would estimate their post ratio is ~3000:1 compared to Ayton.  He’s good at basketball guys."

DeAndre Ayton Mikal Bridges and picks is one ex. Maybe even Cameron Johnson. And this wouldn’t even work because it’s not matching salaries
"Yes, Luka was drafted 3rd to the Hawks which was then traded to mavericks for Trae and another pick. Suns picked the media consensus in Deandre Ayton and the Kings picked Marvin Bagley at 2nd."
"Some thoughts:  Clippers came out the gate and punched the Suns in the mouth. That first quarter was a brutal beatdown. Suns were as careless with the ball as they have been in the past few games but this time they were being careless around several of the best perimeter defenders in the league. That carelessness transitioned into tired, scrambling defense and the Clippers hit the open 3s we gave them.  PG13 might be the streakiest shooter in the NBA with Klay sidelined. He can have games where he's ice cold and others, like tonight, where he is a flamethrower. I think outside the first quarter the Suns did a pretty good job contesting his shots (DA was in his grill for a decent number of his 3s) but those lapses in the first quarter already started the fire.  Mikal's impact was limited by the Clippers. They closed out on him well and closed off his usual slashing. He had a couple of great blocks but the Clippers game planned well to force him off of their wings and he really didn't fight any of those screens.  Jae Crowder was a great defender on Kawhi. He matches Kawhi's physicality well and while he's not as fast as him he has good footwork to keep in front of him. We could have used a little more shooting from him though.  I think this was Booker's first good game of the season. I know he's put up decent numbers but he's come into this year looking sloppy. He only had a couple turnovers which has been a huge issue for him this year and felt like he was actually dialed into the offense.  Cam Johnson probably had one of his worst games of his career tonight. He was taking good shots in theory but when you're cold it's not always a good idea to hoist it up; even if you're open. We were struggling all around but he burned a lot of possessions trying to shoot himself out of a bad night.  Deandre Ayton had a good night. His offensive rebounding and presence in the post really helped the Suns rally there after the rough start. I know he had a negative plus minus but he was out there for a lot of the Clipper's beatdown on the second unit which primarily came from the perimeter rather than anyone Ayton was handling.  It was impressive to watch CP3 pick up Paul George in the second half. He plays some really scrappy defense and you can tell that he got under PG's skin a little which led to the flare up between him and Book. Personally I don't have a problem with people getting heated in a game like that. The Suns were gunning to get back into it and I'm sure the Clippers felt a huge urgency to close it out due to the heat they've received from the media about being chokers. I don't think anyone did anything too out of line and I'd say it was a good game.  The Clippers really need some kind of shot creation outside of a PG13 iso or a Kawhi iso. It works when one of them is hot but there is very little contribution from 3/5 of the guys on the court. Kennard, Ibaka, and Batum all hit huge 3s which definitely helped them win the game but I would like to see them more engaged in the offense. It felt like they are only allowed to touch the ball if they are a) getting a dribble back for Kawhi or PG13 or b) shooting a 3 after a pass from one of their stars. I know its become a pretty common occurrence on teams with two superstars (like the Houston system) but I feel like it's a really stagnant style to play.  Glad I didn't turn this one off because the Suns of the past few years have definitely conditioned me to turn off a game after a quarter like that and grab the whiskey."
"MVP: James Harden (assuming he stays and Rockets nab top seed)  DPOY: Deandre Ayton  MIP: Christian Wood OR Markelle Fultz   6MOY: Terrence Ross   ROY: Anthony Edwards  COTY: Rivers, maybe Monty tho"
Just because the math doesn't have the outcome you want it too doesn't mean it's a bad stat.  It strictly measures how many points you are getting for the number of shots you are taking.  Its the same reason why 3 pt are weighted more heavily as well.  Obviously there's more to look at.  But in your example objectively yes the guy who gets to the line more and is good enough at the line is scoring as efficiently.  Take for example Jimmy butler.  Had 20(19.9) pt per game last year with an efg of .474 but a ts of .585.  No surprises he took 9 ft a game at a good clip.    Vs a guy like deandre ayton who averaged 18.2 pt per game last year on a efg of .548 but a ts of .568.  Hes  only taking 2 ft attempts a game but made them at a fine rate of 75 %.   You can't just act like the free throws don't matter.  They had almost identical usage and butler took 2 less shot attempts per game and scored 2 more points.  That's a significant difference.  Thay 2 pt is the extr 2 percent of ts that he has because of those free throws.  You may not like butlers game because he's playing for the foul but its still effective at doing what's most important which is scoring as many points as you can on every posession.
"A lot of people who were low on him didn't seem to appreciate HOW good he was in Euroleague.  Most Euroleague prospects are either young and raw players who get picked for promising skillsets and athletic tools - e.g. Dragan Bender put up 2.1 ppg in 11 mpg for a sub-bar Maccabi Tel Aviv team before being picked #4. Or else they are more established players without much upside when get picked as win-now prospects, like Bogdan Bogdonavac who was drafted at 25.  Meanwhile Luka was the youngest ever Euroleague MVP during his 18 year old season en route to leading Real to a Euroleague title. He also led Slovenia - not exactly a traditional basketball powerhouse - to the Eurobasket title alongside Goran Dragic.  On top of his pedigree, there was no shortage of film of Doncic playing against legit NBA talents. In the Eurobasket tournament alone, he matched up against Porzingis' Latvia team, the French team with Boris Diaw and Evan Fournier and the Spanish team with both Gasol brothers, both Hernanogomez brothers, Ricky Rubio and Sergio Rodriguez.  That's a much more impressive track record than the level of talent that say, DeAndre Ayton, Marvin Bagley, or Trae Young played against in the NCAA, and that's not even considering the fact that Doncic was playing against grown men while the NCAA prospects were playing against other kids their age. For comparison, Ayton's Wildcats got blown tf out by a Buffalo Bulls team with no future NBA players in the first round of the NCAA tournament."
Was deandre ayton drafted after him because he’s twice the player he is

"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
\- the Phoenix Suns will be the number one seed in the West  \- Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook aren't in their prime anymore (not that hot)  \- Christian Wood is one of the 3 or 4 best offensive big man in the league  \- Jerami Grant is worth his contract  \- Mikal Bridges is better than Deandre Ayton  \- Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum  \- Kelly Oubre isn't the worst player in NBA history  \- What James Wiseman has shown in his first games isn't that promising defensively
"I think its DeAndre Ayton, with Shai very close behind. MPJ still was making too many blunders defensively for him to be near those guys yet. He showed the talent, but it was sometimes a roller coaster on the floor for him between amazing play and bad decision/defense."
"There are multiple young second options I’d rather have over John Collins lol. Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, DeAndre Ayton, Brandon Ingram, just off the top of my head. He’s a good player but he’s not a superstar."

"Deandre Ayton is one of a handful of bigs in the league that can switch onto smaller guards and effectively guard the perimeter. He is also an effective offensive threat and he's a rebounding machine.  An oh yeah, he is historically efficient with a much more diverse shot chart than most traditional bigs, having the ability to score with high efficiency from up to 16 feet out.  That is so. damn. valuable.  Yes, it'd be cool to see him attack the rim with authority or set a physical screen and roll with aggression. He's capable of doing those things, but I really don't care so long as it's working.  I firmly believe that the day will come where we are able to appreciate that Ayton has a soft touch, effective finesse post moves, and a reliable jumper. Bigs that are one-dimensional on offense are a death sentence in the playoffs."

Mikal Bridges puts the clamps on the opposing teams star day in and day out.   Luka Doncic is 1-7 vs. Deandre Ayton.

What is Deandre Ayton as a player? I'd say he's not a terrible number one pick but pretty disappointing. It's his third season and he's looking like a good role player with minimal star potential. I'm not even sure he can stay on the floor vs. some matchups in a high level playoff series.

Deandre Ayton also looks like he doesn't want to be on the court to me
"You can get more comfortable in whatever defensive system you’re in. Deandre Ayton looked like he was going to be a major project on defense early as a rookie, but he became more comfortable with NBA schemes and the increased movement/anticipation it requires. Guys can get more disciplined, and guys figure out where to go on switches and certain actions. Part of that is effort but another part is just learning."
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"Bam Adebayo, DeAndre Ayton, and Valanciunas can't either"
That would cause even more problems lol. You would have small market teams even more desperate and offering guys like Deandre Ayton huge contracts that would leave them crippled for a long time
Deandre Ayton
"Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Lauri Markennen, Karl Anthony-Towns, Kristaps Porzingis all did well in their rookie year.  Just from the last 5.  He doesnt need to dominate, but Wiseman just looks so lost out there."
Can’t wait for Shaqs reaction when deandre Ayton clears 60 million a  year

"Tyson Chandler was nothing special most of career until he linked up with Chris Paul and became a rim running, stand in the right place big man. He didn't even block shots.  Like, Tyson Chandler is the peak of the bare minimum big man. Of course I don't expect a rookie Wiseman to be exactly prime Tyson Chandler but can he should hit 60 TS, stand in the right place and box out. Wiseman one of the biggest centers in the league.  😂 How low of expectations do people have of the #2 pick who plays with an MVP in their prime and a DPOY and has a COY for a coach.  Tyson Chandler isn't even a top 50 big man. His prime doesn't even rate.   I expect high picks to perform like starters. Even though Deandre Ayton was the wrong pick, you couldn't say he sucked. At least Suns got a productive starter that you can project to be at least an all star once or twice as a 20 and 10 guy just by his rookie season. You can't even say that about Wiseman."
Semi unpopular opinion: whether or not DeAndre Ayton becomes what Suns fans want him to be(which maybe he will maybe he won’t) it won’t happen for another 4 or 5 years. His developmental curve is gonna be slow he still has a long way to go and he doesn’t fit this timeline where their window is now
"you'd find this to be true at any selection.  DeAndre Ayton was the #1 pick and looks like a role player, Markelle Fultz will be lucky to be a solid role player at this point.  Same for Andrew Wiggins.  Is getting the #1 pick unlucky?"
You could tell me Deandre Ayton is 40 and I would believe you.
"I believe KG and Deandre Jordan have both had blocks like that for people who've never seen it before. Marcus smart has done this too but doesn't look as impressive.   This is a good one for sure, but is mainly due to a tough pass by Booker and Ayton being behind the ball. Bit of a mishap on their end led to this being within Pats reach."

Suns could have drafted   * Jamal Murray  * Domantas Sabonis  * Donavan Mitchell  * Luka Doncic  Instead of :  * Dragan Bender  * Marquese Chriss  * Josh Jackson  * DeAndre Ayton  to pair with Booker since. This game can be played with pretty much every team in the lottery.
"My first thought when I watched this (and I hope it isn’t true) is that Ant is responding as someone who’s heard from everywhere that LaMelo is the generational talent, that he’s the clear cut best player from the draft and, as a result, people already view him as a disappointment if not outright a bust (the same fear I have with people when they compare Deandre Ayton to Luka).  Don’t get me wrong, LaMelo is the runaway RoY thus far and Edwards has struggled with his shooting this year, but I fear that media and fans won’t let him develop at his pace because LaMelo might reach stardom quicker"
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"PnR is NOT necessarily rim protection, although it can be. Switching is NOT necessarily rim protection, although it can be in a limited number of contexts. Weakside help defense is NOT necessarily rim protection, although it can be.  Your argument is a logical fallacy. While it may be true that good defenders get steals it doesn't necessarily follow that because you get steals you're a great defender. Jokic falls in the latter category. TJ McConnell is leading the league in steals; haven't heard anybody call him an elite perimeter defender yet.  In what universe is half a season of PnR data a legitimate sample size? That same data says DeAndre Ayton is better than AD. And let me be clear: You don't believe that Jokic is a better PnR defender than either Embiid or Gobert despite the stats you posted. You don't believe it."

Give the Lakers Steph Curry After the LoveFest he and LeBron had at the All-Star Game            Give the Nets Deandre Ayton and CJ McCollum to come off the bench
When we feed Deandre Ayton our offense goes on hunger strike. He cannot sustain an offense. Continually throwing into the block and stagnating the offense for a guy who has no post moves is a ridiculous idea
"I just played a game in MyLeague between the Suns and 76ers.  DeAndre Ayton was called for the 3-sec violation but it was legit....I just forgot to move him while I watched the Sixers move the ball around.  But on the very next possession, Joel Embiid stood with both feet in the key and didn't move until he got the rebound, a good 12 seconds.  THAT I see all the time, and not just Embiid."
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
DeAndre Ayton kind of but not really. I could see the guy becoming a monster but his current trajectory is a solid rebounder who can score well. Also Marvin Bagley III
It's easily BeefCat he's a fucking legend.   Delivers when you least expect it but man it hits perfect every time.  Honorable mention: I get like 250 upvotes every time I mention that DeAndre Ayton took a diuretic not because he was juicing but it's because he loves peeing bro cmon.
"You just gave me 4 former alllstars, and Clint Capela and DeAndre Ayton"
Deandre ayton just became elite 😎
I mean you guys should thank them lmao Wiseman is like DeAndre Ayton but slightly worse and Lamelo already looks like a star
also deandre ayton becoming DPOY caliber and Bridges becoming the best role player in the league.
"Luka wasn’t the consensus 2nd overall pick. It was the owner of the Suns who was obsessed with Deandre Ayton and thought as he played for the Arizona Wildcats he could become a local legend. Owners don’t understand basketball in the granular detail coaches and analysts do.  Imagine the Suns with a line up of Booker, Luka, Bridges and Ty Halliburton (who the Suns passed on in the last draft). Shit, those 4 might beat other NBA teams playing with five players!"
"Devin Booker played 65 games, Chris Paul played 68 games, Deandre Ayton played 69 games, Mikal Bridges played 69 games. Your team has been healthy the entire fucking season.  Quit lying LMFAO"
no Deandre Ayton
Plot twist - it was a DeAndre Ayton burner
"&gt;bad team  Congrats for pointing out the roster around him was bad, thats not a commentary on Kobe as a player, and telling thats your go to 'dispute. Good on Shaq for being fortunate to be on a better team, but he was a worse player. Next you're gonna tell me DeAndre Ayton is better than Steph Curry."
"I thought I’d seen the dumbest Gobert takes by Sixers fans. Then I read you say, without irony, that Deandre Ayton is better than Gobert on defense “in most circumstances.” This is the new king of dumbass Gobert takes. Lol. Take a bow!"
I can’t tell if Deandre Ayton is the 35th best player in the league or the 100th
"Rudy Gobert is 245, Nik Vucevic is 260, Deandre Ayton is 250, Ivica Zubac is 240, etc. Obviously those aren’t going to be exact at any given moment, but I don’t think anybody would describe any of those guys as light"
[Deandre Ayton](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629028/)      [Rudy Gobert](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203497/)      One is 6 years older than the other with almost the same advanced stat line. I would argue Ayton is better under most circumstances because the Jazz team defense is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Suns team defense.
"Really didn’t think the Warriors would have a chance on the second night of a back to back against a full Suns squad. I really love how the Warriors use the Sun’s overplay against Steph against them, back door cuts, fake hand offs, lobs over defenders looking for Steph. Everybody growing up is always taught to keep an eye on the ball and an eye on your man, against the Warriors, you gotta keep an eye out for Steph as well. Damn proud of the Warriors. For the Suns: Devin Booker is a fucking problem, scores at will and near impossible to defend 1 on 1. CP3 did his usual thing too. And wtf, Cameron Payne was killing it too in his reserve minutes.  Only thing I thought sucked for the Suns was Deandre Ayton, I really thought he would punish small ball Warriors and Kevon Looney, but he didn’t really do shit"

These comments should be fun lol. The 30 pt triple double on more than 50 percent shooting will never be enough for many on this sub because his defense isn’t at minimum DeAndre Ayton level. Not sure what else they want from my guy.
"Dude, DeAndre Ayton, Frank Kaminsky &amp; Dario Saric have no chance against AD &amp; LeBron. Even if they're not 100%. Suns would probably be your ideal first round matchup."

Honest question from a team with a young big that has huge potential but is still developing: does Deandre Ayton look like the number 1 overall pick yet? Or does he still need more time?
Deandre Ayton is a great nutrition stats player.  Every single one of his points and rebounds is worth full calories.

I haven’t really watched a lot of his interviews. Is Deandre Ayton hilarious?
Why does deandre Ayton look 1000 years old
"""Marc Gasols defense on him might've been the best i've seen anyone play all year.""  Deandre Ayton: Hold my beer."
"Those are all things Deandre Ayton does, but doesn't get any credit for. I'm not saying he's on Gobert's level yet but he has that same intimidating presence in the paint that scares people away."
"Hmm. Not Jokic, Not Embiid, Not Gobert, recently not AD, not deandre, or Brook Lopez, not Vucevic...I don't watch ayton, randle, or capela enough.   Maybe jae crowder"
"Ehh, Deandre Ayton #1 tier talent, Devin Booker and CP3?   vs. Julius Randle?   It's close, but if the Knicks get end like 8-1 or something I'm voting Thibs."
"All the conversations about Booker and Paul, while such little mention of the team having DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, and Cam Johnson all playing extremely good basketball is what's truly been funny. This team has an elite supporting cast around their top 2.  I think that is the reason Phoenix does not need two guys, and I think CP3 brings a bit more to the team and that is reflected in the impact metrics. If Booker goes down, you trust CP3 to pick up the scoring or get a guy like Ayton more shots and more involved. If CP3 goes down, you lose a great defender and your main playmaker."

"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months...

I compared pre-Max Wiggins with last season Julius Randle before Randle took the step from high volume low quality offense to offensive star. The potential was there but I didn't really believed that he would get make it.  I am usually skeptical about players taking that step. Most players with the potential to take that step don't take it.  Deandre Ayton is useful for a contender as a role player center.   Other players that should have been better than they were: Jeff Green  and Monta Ellis.
"Nash took a team from 29 wins to 62. That's a 33 win swing and they went from a 35 to 75% Winning percentage. Paul went to a team that was just under 0.500 and brought them to a 58 win pace. Not to mention Phoenix has a full season of DeAndre Ayton and Booker gets another year to grow, and they brought in a lot of players that have been great for them. It's not just Paul.  EDIT: Nash went to a team that very much remained the same. The only real change was Nash. Stoudemire went from a 21 ppg guy to 26 ppg but a lot of that can also be attributed to Nash who was spoon feeding him baskets."
"DeAndre ""Hook shot over 6'5 guard from point blank range"" Ayton"
Having to max Deandre Ayton is tough. Dude is looking more like a higher end role player than a star.

"What’s up Bucks fans who doesn’t watch any Suns games. Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, and Deandre Ayton have taken massive leaps this season. They’re not the same players they were last year. CP3 isn’t leading the Suns right now to 12 wins above the 8 seed all by himself lmao."
I like Ayton because he’s like the only big man who doesnt go ballistic on the Celtics. Nice guy Deandre
"Kemba, Tatum and Smart 🤩🤩🤩  Also, Deandre Ayton is incredible. It feels like he is very underused. We were due for a bad DBook game with how much he dominates us.  Also also, Chris Paul is so amazing at the sport of basketball. The amount of foul court passes he makes is insane."
Something is funky with those numbers. It's saying that Deandre Ayton is leading the league in total post ups defended at... 75. Which is obviously not true. Should be several hundred for the guys at the top.
"Producers: ""Okay Molly, so you know what's happening on today's show, right?""  Molly: ""We'll be talking about the emergence of the Phoenix Suns this season under Monty Williams, with the impact of Chris Paul and the development of DeAndre Ayton?""  Producers:  ""Don't be silly - you need to tell Stephen A that LeBron is miles ahead of Jordan and will only solidify that with a ring this season. If that doesn't take us through to the end, tell Max that you don't want Iguodala taking the final shot for the Miami Heat in playoffs games this season."""
Deandre ayton is a living embodiment of a brick wall
Rudy Gobert  David Thompson  Joe Dumars  Jrue Holiday  DeAndre Ayton (mostly relative to his draft class) or Draymond
Um. Deandre Ayton?
Where you getting the 44 inch vertical for McGee? Everywhere I see is closer to 33. I say this because I thought Deandre Ayton was the highest combo of height and vertical since Shaq if this [video](https://twitter.com/deandreayton/status/912502520609521664) is true.
"These comparisons are always weird. Like do you give Wilt (or whoever you take from the past) the training from today’s game?  And do you put him in an modern day offense? Like for example you say he can average 7 assists. That only happens if the offense is run through him. Unless he plays on the perimeter like a guard the way Jokic plays a lot, there’s just no way he even has the usage to average 7 assists. Would they allow him to play that way though? You say he could play 38 mpg today? But no C today plays that much since everyone is afraid they’ll get injured. So there’s almost no way that he’ll play 38 mpg, even if he could. Modern day coaches might just play him in a role similar to what DeAndre Ayton is playing for the Suns, but he’ll probably be a better overall player (especially on defense to start with) than Ayton. He’ll definitely be a better shooter (even if only marginally) than he was in the 60s with all the emphasis/training on shooting today."

"That is a still image from a single angle. When you look at the *video* of the shot, you can see that the milliseconds when the contact takes place has no visible, *physical* impact on Booker's motion, and that he begins the shot after the contact has taken place.  You cannot determine a foul on a single, still image - and you can get a single, still image so say anything.  For example, [here is a screenshot I took from my laptop that appears to show Deandre Ayton pushing PJ Tucker as he takes a shot in OT](https://imgur.com/a/NUnLstm). Do I think this was a foul? No, the contact *was* intentional but when we [watch the video](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=657&amp;GameID=0022000873&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Tucker%204%27%20Cutting%20Layup%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) (and not just a still image from a single perspective) it's clear that this contact doesn't affect the shot. By the rules this might have been a foul (different to the foul against Booker however, due to the contact on the latter appearing to be incidental as he moves from blocking to the side), but if this is the level of contact you want to be called then get ready for 40 Giannis FTs every game, because that's what you're asking for."
Jokic figure out Favors this year and torched him. Miles Turner and DeAndre Ayton are both probably the best Jokic stoppers in the league. I don't think bam was that great on Jokic this year.
"You brought up ft% thats why I brought it up. Rjs ft% is what mostly hurts his ts%  Also you cant compare the efficiency of established players in the league that are 23-24 years old to a 20 year old as justification for who has the most potential. I gave you those fg% as examples of why you shouldn't just judge a 20 year old on efficiency metrics.  Knicks are my second fav team so I watch most of their games. I've seen him play. Hes a solid defender and has been a huge contribute in the knicks sucsess as well as hitting really big shots in the clutch. I honestly dont think you watch them play and you just hop on bball reference, glance at ts% and call it a day.  Do you seriously think a near 25 year old Mikal Bridges has more potential than rj because of his three point percentage? In case you didnt know the guy came in the league 3 years older than RJ and came into the league with 43/33/80 splits. But please, tell me more about Mikal Bridges having more potential than RJ for his shooting splits at the same age RJ will be in HIS 5TH SEASON  Now lets look at Deandre Hunter. At 22 years old (2 years older than RJ) He had shot 41% from the field and 35% from 3.  Your only argument is RJs efficiency (which has dramatically improves over last season) despite me showing you multiple reasons why judging a 20 year olds efficiency stats isn't the best way to assess potential.  Ayton having more potential than RJ is a pretty fair assessment imo."

"&gt;if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  what are you talking about? what stat did i use that has that? ts% certainly does not.  and we're not talking about whether or not he can be good or has any potential, i've never claimed that he doesn't, we're comparing him to the players above him who are on the list. scoring efficiency is not the end-all be-all, but when your game is predicated mostly on only being a scorer, it's something important we need to look at.  mikal bridges is a 41% three point shooter with 64%ts, literally one of the most efficient scorers in the entire league and will probably make an all-defensive team this year  john collins scored 21 on 65% ts last season, miles and miles ahead of RJ as a scorer.   deandre ayton an elite rebounder, anchor of one of the best defenses in the league while scoring 15 per game on 62% from the floor  deandre hunter again an elite defender already with 62%ts  lonzo is a much better defender and a better distributor, while being  more efficient.  RJ giving you 17 points on 15 shots just isn't that impressive in comparison considering what else he brings. he could develop into a great player and recently has been looking much better, but you're acting like a spot on this list is owed to him when he hasn't proven anything really in comparison to guys who made it onto the list. he might have a case for an honorable mention or an argument for the last spot on the list, but to act like he's some crazy snub and deserves to be on over the guys you listed is legitimately just a stupid opinion that makes it look like you already were a fan of his and saw ppg and thought that's the only thing that matters."
"Which two of Jokic, Embiid, KAT, and Gobert will DeAndre Ayton pass next year?"
If his improved jumpshooting this season holds up then I would say yes. There's really no way for a defense to deal with him other than having someone who can play him straight up 1 on 1 and not double. Deandre Ayton has actually done the best job of what I've seen this season
Consider this: Deandre fucking Ayton is arguably the Suns FOURTH best player
The good ol' DeAndre Ayton.
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton

"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
Also Deandre Ayton with 26/11 on 10/11 shooting
I can't wait to watch DeAndre Ayton in his prime. That is all.
Deandre Ayton is becoming everything I hoped he would be
Deandre Ayton
deandre ayton is just so dang good
"We all love trae and will stick by our guy till we die. With that being said ... obviously we missed out on luka.  I had on my pre draft board 1. Luka 2. Trae 3. D. ayton 4. J^3 5. Collin Sexton 6. Miles Bridges 7. WENDELL Carter Jr.  I'm sad we missed out on wonder boy, but I'm so fucking happy with trae. The trade also allowed us to get DeAndre Hunter w the 4th pick and allowed us to snag Reddish as a project w the 10th pick. Thats our 2nd best player and our 2 best wing defenders. Call it a rare win/win."
We’re watching the NBA’s 5th coming and it makes me irrationally mad at Deandre Ayton.
A more interesting question is how a team built of 3rd best players would do.  PG: Conley SG: Kyrie SF: Middleton (Jrue is the 2nd best player) PF: Tobias Harris C: DeAndre Ayton
Deandre ayton
Deandre ayton
Never beat DeAndre Ayton though
"Better question:   Replace Deandre Ayton and Devin Booker with Russ and Beal, who gets better who gets worse?"
"Here are some of his buckets tonight:   - coast to coast 8 foot floater  - pinning Blake Griffin on the baseline for a sideline out of bounds play into a dunk  - behind the back face up into 3 with Blake Griffin soft closing out  - iso size up into 18 foot pull up  - crosses harden into a wide open paint for the dunk  - crossover, hesi, then baseline drive past Griffin for the nice finger roll coming from baseline  - gets the switch defender from off the dribble, resets and hits the 3  - crossover, hard dribble into to a side step layup from edge of the paint (5+ feet), finishing over his head for the and 1  - hard dribble into other hand swim through move, finishing a heavily contested layup  I mean, why didn’t Javale McGee just do stuff like that hell? Hell, what about Marquesse Chriss... he’s a 6’9 240 (Giannis 6’11 240) dude who has a 40 inch vertical. Why isn’t he doing that kinda stuff? Maybe because it takes a shitload of skill, and it takes even more skill to do it with insane body control and good feetwork while being that massive and tall.  Just because he doesn’t literally have the handle of a point guard doesn’t mean he’s not skilled. Those moves to get buckets all take skill, there’s a good reason you’re not seeing Deandre Ayton pull those out once a game, much less 15x a game... and Ayton is still hella skilled"
Cp3 Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton :-) Go suns!
"I’d rather have Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikhail Bridges, Jae Crowder and Deandre Ayton."
"The Suns improvement last season shouldn't be totally ignored too. To go from 19-63 to 34-39 (38-44 pace in an 82-game season) is a pretty big step as well. Not to mention the fact the Suns ended up a game short of the playoffs in a season where Deandre Ayton missed 25 games due to a suspension, which led to Baynes playing too much and thus getting hurt himself. Rubio and Booker missed some time as well.   Rubio was truly a massive floor raiser for the Suns, who went from having some of the worst guard play in recent NBA history to having a solid lead guard that really helped Booker's load and also elevated Ayton's game specifically. Rubio wasn't the ceiling raiser that Paul has proven to be, but he played such a massive role in the massive improvement the Suns had from 18-19 to 19-20."
"Here's the thing: Wiseman hasn't looked good so far at all, and on top of that he's injured so he can't actually do much over the offseason. Unless he somehow manages to surprise the hell out of all of us and comes back looking like DeAndre Ayton, no one should expect much out of him next season.   Why is this a problem? Because Curry is one of those rare generational talents that puts a team in contention each year, assuming they build around him properly, but he's not getting any younger. The Warriors don't have the time to develop an extremely raw center, but this hiring seems to indicate that that's exactly what they're going to do. If so, it looks as if they aren't nearly as interested in competing for a title (I'm assuming all of the team's main pieces are going to be back and healthy next year, of course) as they ought to be.   In that case, why stick around if you're Curry? You saw how he played this year... put him on a contending team for the next few years and there's a decent shot that he can pick up another title or two. Unless he's not interested in getting any more rings, which I find very hard to believe, he needs to go and find a team looking to do everything it can to win now."
"It is. And as good as Deandre and Tyson were, Ayton might be the best big cp3s ever played with. Hes been amazing so far in the playoffs."
"none of them, Timelord is Mitchell Robinson but Celtic fans act like he’s Deandre Ayton"
"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic , Jaren Jackson Jr, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Brides, Michael Porter Jr   Which one of these players is he better than?"
"Doesn't change the narrative of 11 years since last playoffs, Monty Williams and his tragic history, Chris Paul's past playoff injuries, Devin Bookers empty stats narrative, Deandre Ayton being picked over Luka, et c et c, the list goes on"
It's genuinely insane that Deandre Ayton isn't on this list.
"While I know Mattisse is absurdly good defensively, in general, steals and blocks do not serve necessarily as a sign of whether someone is playing great defense.   Allen Iverson lead the league in steals.  Deandre Ayton had 1 block in the Nuggets series.  The Suns in general had the 6th best defense this year and were 19th in steals and 25th in blocks."
The analysis on Ayton would have been better served by showing how he held jokic one-on-one as opposed to showing what he scored on the entire team much of which was not on Deandre.  Jokic only scored 53 points total on Ayton in the entire series on 41‰ FG and 2-12 from 3pt FG
I don’t see DeAndre Ayton.  This list is trash.
"According to Google, Deandre Ayton is on a 4 year / $40,379,230 contract. Comes out to $10,094,808 average.  That's a biweekly (before tax) paycheck of **$403,792.32** or an hourly rate of $5,047.40.  I can't even fathom receiving a notification every 2 weeks for $400k.  And then you have CP3 who's making $41,358,814 this year. That's $1,654,352.56 every 2 weeks! Absolutely insane!"
"I see at least one person in every post of DeAndre Ayton talking comment that they did not expect his voice to be as high pitched as it is, so I guess him."
"I owe DeAndre Ayton, the organization, and their fans an apology for laughing at them for selecting him ahead of Luka, Trae, and JJJ. I apologize for doubting him."
"Idek who that is lmao   The Suns will win the chip, carried by the first overall pick, DeAndre Ayton.  Bucks will win thid series against the Nets bc KD is washed."
Who would have known that booker and ayton would be better fit with Paul than deandre and blake..
Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton next season.
"If Deandre Ayton had the ball, would Jokic have done that exact same swat?  No."
"Trae Young, Luke Doncic, and Deandre Ayton would be the 3 in that case."
But considering last year:  -ran offense through Rubio   -Didn't have Crowder  -And wasn't Deandre Ayton Injured for most of the season? lmao

Deandre Ayton is so fucking wholesome damn.
why does deandre ayton look like a 40 yo crack addict?
Deandre Edoneille Ayton will be an all-star next season!
"Zion = The Big Easy  Ben Simmons = Ben Kenobi (because of his Jedi force field that keeps all defenders 5 feet away on the perimeter)  Kawhi Leonard = Wi-Fi (because he's awesome until he decides to take a break on you)  Deandre Ayton = The Anomaly (per some writer on the Atlantic who called him an ""anomaly"" in his scouting report pre draft)  Markelle Fultz = MH370 (because his game disappeared and no one's sure why)  Luka Doncic = The Puppet Master (per Gilbert Arenas)  Andrew Wiggins = Adrian (his biggest youtube clip is a prankster asking him if his name is Adrian, which says a lot)"
"The problem I have here is you're looking at each move individually, panning them for being 'bad', and ignoring the result of those decisions.    &gt; he gave up TJ Warren for nothing  He gave up TJ Warren for cap space and used that to pick up Ricky Rubio.  Rubio was a massive upgrade over our past PG rotation and it wouldn't have happened without the TJ Warren trade.  Ricky Rubio was very good for the Suns.  &gt; The Cam pick is so overrated. He reached for no reason to get an off the bench rotation player. Cam would have been available in the 20s or later.  Cam Johnson plays off the bench, sure.  For one of the top teams in the league, in the playoffs, against top tier opponents.  Also, that trade back from 6 brought in Dario Saric, who, apart from the few weeks after he had Covid, has been one of our most important, and impactful, bench players.    &gt; And he traded a FRP (ended up being Desmond Bane) for 1 year of an aging Aron Baynes.  Aron Baynes played great basketball under heavy minutes in replacement for a suspended DeAndre Ayton.  We literally do not make the play in tournament without him.  You're also leaving out a few key pieces of this whole thing.  The first being the trade for Kelly Oubre.  Kelly Oubre immediately improved our locker room culture.  The entire ""Valley Boys"" brand and mentality stems from Kelly Oubre.  Secondly, he brought in Cameron Payne from the Chinese league just before the bubble.  Cameron Payne has been our best bench player in a group of guys that all contribute when they get minutes.  Finally, Monty Williams, enough said.  &gt; one trade that he lucked into imo bc CP3 wanted to play with the core that Jones had no part in drafting, and Crowder signed bc of CP3.  You think CP3 wanted to come to Phoenix without this team going 8-0 in the bubble and without Monty Williams as our coach?  He doesn't.  Give credit where credit is due, CP3 wanted to be here as a direct result of the improved culture, coaching, and play.  All of which were the effects of James Jone's actions.  If the moves James Jones made notably improved the quality of our team, they were not bad moves."
"I mean Deandre ayton had one this all star break at 22, but idk about anyone having 2"
Does DeAndre Ayton count even though he's kinda been going off this postseason? I can see him cementing himself as a top 5 center in the NBA by year end next season
"Jazz. The Clippers are in yet another series where the star PG(or in Luka's case point-forward sort of) is dominating the Clippers. Luka was the best player in that Dallas/Clippers series, and so far, Donovan Mitchell has been the best player in this series. I think the Clippers might be out of gas. On top of Mitchell, you've gotta find an answer for the DPOY. Maybe Kawhi can match Mitchell, but I don't know who else on that team is gonna be able to neutralize Rudy. Had a ho-hum Game 1, and came back and showed out in Game 2. 12 points, 20 boards, 2 steals, AND 3 blocks? Good luck with that is all I can say. Rudy is a problem, a problem I'm not yet convinced Deandre Ayton can solve, assuming the Jazz sweep the Clippers(sorry Nuggets fans, that shit is wrap. Jokic can't do it alone)."
Tyson Chandler &gt; Deandre Ayton
"The Suns haven't just played well this series, they also match up incredibly well against the Nuggets defensively. Case in point with Deandre Ayton essentially shutting down Jokic. Jokic had 32 last night, but it took him 29 shots to get there. People were saying he needed help, but it's hard for the starters to get in rhythm when he's taking as many shots as the rest of them combined. (Aaron Gordon was a mess tho, dont get me wrong)"

"Depends how the game look exactly (let's put it like that, IF we had Suns-Nets finals, and Suns won, the main story will not be how Suns won, but how the 3 superstars lost).  But I do think that people will always have very different opinion on 30% usage players and 20% usage players.  You can already see in this thread the comment that literally says ""but Dirk didn't have DeAndre Ayton in his team!"". So, yeah, it's a different thing when you're not the first option, the importance of such player is much more controversial."
1st game was an OT thriller though. Playoff atmosphere and fans along with home court could make the difference. Really wanna see Book go Kobe mode in the finals though. I know Ayton will eat on the Nets if that ends up being the matchup. They’ll probably give DeAndre Jordan some run because nobody on Brooklyn can match up.
"I can't compare this to 2011 Mavs, Dirk Nowitzki did not have Devin Booker and Deandre ayton lol, but obviously it depends, it looks like things are actually going to go in the reverse for Chris Paul this year where he benefits from the other teams injuries, but if he beats a healthy Jazz and a healthy Brooklyn that's obviously going to lift his legacy a lot, but honestly the person who it would benefit the most might be Devin Booker, if Devin Booker just balls out and somehow even gets a Finals MVP she will have an immediate bragging rights over his other young peers in the game"
"Suns Bucks finals, Suns Canadian sweep... Deandre Ayton finals MVP"
DEANDRE AYTON
"Deandre Ayton wired up for sound: ""Even I know Suns should have picked Doncic"""
"Damn you just gonna diss DBook, CP3, and DeAndre Ayton like that?"
"Wow so much to say  1) The most vibrant outfit is Devonte Graham dressed all in black wearing a bright  puffy vest...how is that the most vibrant outfit in the NBA? I see fucking middle aged suburban women rocking that shit daily  2) The freshest pregame outfit is Blake Griffin in a pair of sweat shorts with a black long sleve shirt and some Joradans on. Meanwhile Deni Avdija's worst outfit is...shorts and a t-shirt with a pair of white sneakers. So apparently the voters in this poll are both impressed and offended by the most basic shit you can wear pregame? Talk about schizophrenic.  3) Meanwhile one of the hardest to pull off outfits is...Deandre Ayton in...a denim jacket and jeans with a black shirt. Dudes come on that shit is so basic how can you not pull that off.  Or Cedi Osman in...a white jacket with a hoodie and skinny jeans. Like what?  4) Apparently LeBron James wearing a denim jacket and black jeans is...edgy? Ummm ok. Seems pretty basic to me.   5) Back to vibrancy. Josh Jackson is the most vibrant in the NBA rocking....a flannel shirt, beanie, black tee and black skinny jeans. Have these people ever been to Portland or Seattle or Brooklyn? Or like..any rural area? Jeans, tee, flannel and beanie isn't vibrant it's fucking basic fall clothing. Also apparently just wearing a bright hoodie with black pants makes you vibrant?   I gotta stop now but this shit is wack dudes."
That Mitchell take certainly is hot.   My current favorite hot take is Deandre Ayton&gt;Bam
"Dwight had an offense run through him. Ayton already has a better offensive game than Rudy and does SO MUCH MORE than just layups and dunks. Capela shoots from 3-10 feet and at least attempts mid range shots. Bam shoots mid range and threes.   Congrats, Rudy is better at dunks and layups than Steven Adams and washed up Deandre Jordan. Is that really what you’re proud of?  Also calling Ayton a post up center shows how little you actually know"
Deandre Ayton
"But as for right now, unhealthy CP3 adopts Bron and the Lakers as his son with partial custody from DBook ""the Lakers Assassin"" and Deandre ""ADisneys father"" Ayton"
"Lmao Bron gets sonned by Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton because he ""has nothing left to prove."" Yikes!"
"Just like with DeAndre Ayton, if a big is a liability as a rookie they are 100% a bust and can never contribute to a contending team /s"
"DeAndre Ayton is more important in this series but Booker is better in general, and it’s not even close."
&gt; Ayton got a lot of slack and he went in the Doncic draft.

"That's Deandre ""AD stopper"" Ayton for you."
Deandre Ayton is good example of not to give up on developing young centers like Wiseman. But team must also surround them with young players so they can learn together  This may not be a good case with Golden State because their aging all stars who don't have the time to wait for Wiseman
How is Zion over Deandre ayton right now for most people lol
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
1. Luka  2. Tatum  3. Zion  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. DeAndre Ayton
"Ayton looking like the best center CP3 has played with. Tyson Chandler was mostly a lob threat in New Orleans. Deandre Jordan took years to develop, had 0 offensive game, but was decent defensively. Capela is basically the same story as the previous two, mostly a lob threat with some rim protection. And Adams last year was okay but really a shell of his former self. Just crazy as a long CP3 fan that he can throw it Ayton near the free throw line and Ayton has multiple ways of attacking. Not too mention his defense might be the best part of his game."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
I wanna see Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges on this list next year.
"Jokic is being guarded by DeAndre Ayton. Who the hell are the Nets showing Giannis? Giannis is playing poorly because his limitations make it easy to gameplan for him.  Also the Nuggets are also supposed to be worse than the Bucks right now, so solely comparing the Suns to the Nets is also a bad faith comparison."

"Deandre ""The Dark Knight"" Ayton conquering ""The Joker"" Nikola Jokic for the second straight game.  Saw that in the Suns sub and I decided to steal it. Sorry."
"CP3 turned DeAndre Jordan into an All-NBA first team member, he was definitely expected to unlock Ayton"
"DeAndre ""Jordan"" Ayton"
Deandre Ayton really made an effort not to foul.
Deandre Ayton 1-5 FG so far
Mikal Bridges and DeAndre Ayton both not getting a single vote is a goddamn travesty. I'm more upset about that than I am Monty not winning COTY.
Deandre Ayton seems like a really nice dude
"Superstars: Players in their prime that have won league MVP or played at an MVP level in the Regular Season, Playoffs, and/or both.   - Bron Bron  - KD - Jokic - Kawhi - Curry - Harden - Giannis  - Luka  - Street Clothes  - Kyrie  - Dame  - Embiid   Bron Bron:   &gt; Draymond Green   KD:  &gt;   Kawhi:  &gt; PJ Tucker (check the stats)   Curry:  &gt; Dillon Brooks cuz I can’t remember who else really slows him down 1v1   Harden:  &gt; Wes Matthews   Jokic:  &gt; DeAndre Ayton (No, it ain’t just recency bias nephews)   Giannis:  &gt; ~~The freethrow line~~ Just kidding, probably Jonathan Isaac   Embiid:  &gt; Marc Gasol aka Big Daddy Spain  Luka:  &gt; Porzingis   AD:  &gt; Draymond Green   Kyrie:  &gt; No idea.

DeAndre Ayton can defend any big I think
Is he even better than DeAndre Ayton tbh?
"it's one thing to have a bad game, it's another to get outplayed by deandre ayton as the current ""mvp"""
Deandre Ayton
"but how many ""mvp"" got cooked by deandre ayton ?"
Can they please get rid of that stupid RAPTOR stat? It’s ironic that they write an article saying Deandre Ayton has arrived when they have been rating him as a worse player than Royce O’Neale (and not even a top 50 player) this season based on the stat that they created.
ben simmons is a deandre ayton level #1 overall pick where he's not a bust but he's not #1 pick worthy
If he can put on the weight I’m with ya. He needs to get on that Deandre Ayton workout plan lol
"the ""mvp"" is getting cooked by deandre ayton  you hate to see it"
[LeBron taking a shot at DeAndre from behind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvJ1W2mPUQ)  This video literally labels it as DeAndre running in to LeBron when LeBron clearly takes a shot at Ayton.

"I would say that 2018 could be seen as better than 2003.(depending on the development of 3rd year players- very speculative as you can imagine) 2018 is imo deeper than 2003 as well as featuring two guards that probably will be HoF barring injuries and Deandre Ayton who still could become a All-NBA center. Shai and MPJ and possibly even Sexton and JJJ might become Allstars  one day. Mikal, Mitchell Robinson and Timelord might make a defensive team or two in the future.And that is not even considering the tons of good role players in this class. Especially if Doncic and Trae become all timers I think this class could easily be Top 3"
Not gonna lie I read that and thought DeAndre Jordan since I mainly see people here only refer to him as Ayton. That being said he's a good up and coming C for sure but for now he's nowhere near Rudy's level.
I thought deandre ayton was known as a center coming into the league who wouldn’t play good defense. I guess he’s improved a lot.
"Well nothing has really been proven, so maybe it sounds overly paranoid, but the ironic thing is that John Collins and DeAndre Ayton have already been popped for PEDs, and their teams are having strong postseason runs. What are the odds that they are the only two dudes in the league using?  I think people would rather just enjoy the ride than think about it. There was a lot of celebration of Lance Armstrong, Mark McGwire, Marion Jones, Barry Bonds, etc. before more of the dirt came out about them. It ruins the fun to some extent. People just want to enjoy the stories."
They need to add another two maxes in prep for the Deandre “Batman” Ayton led Suns
"With this and the video posted in this thread, I have no choice but to protect Deandre Ayton at all costs.   First order of business is to destroy all copies of NBA 2K so he doesn't have to get mad anymore."
"Of course Bridges is gonna be more efficient when he’s playing off CP3, Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton. OG playing off of Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, has to create way more for himself."
Why wouldn’t you just say “Can DeAndre Ayton be the Batman to Denver’s Joker?”
"Probably KD, but for teams that don't have Deandre Ayton Jokic is pretty impossible to stop too."
A lot of players play worse in the playoffs than they do in the regular season.  And then there's DeAndre Ayton.  The antithesis to Kuzma
"It is of my opinion, that is I would say, that DeAndre Ayton is proficient at putting the ball in the basket."

"I’m really enjoying watching this Suns team when it isn’t my team they are stomping!  Deandre Ayton is starting to show why he was taken 1st overall and Mikal Bridges is a superb defender who can knock his shots down at a decent clip. It goes without saying Booker and CP3 are incredible.   The Suns just have a well constructed roster. I think we’ll see a Jazz vs. Suns final, with the winner facing the Nets."
Of course he can :)  PG: Damian Lilliard  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Serge Ibaka  C: Deandre Ayton
#DEANDRE AYTON
DeAndre Ayton is a beast. That's why you draft the 7 footer with elite tools at #1
"Credit to James Jones for assembling a good team. Credit to Monty Williams for managing this team. Credit to Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton for leading the charge.  Suns in 6."
"That guy unironically thinks that Giannis and Shaq are comparable, Holy crap.  Shaq went up against Tim Duncan and David Robinson at the same time and made them look like fools, he didn't play the corpse of Blake Griffin and the injured Nets or DeAndre Ayton."
"CP3 is 0-12 in playoff games reffed by Scott Foster. This has a probability of something like .02%, yes it's that bizarre, that it definitely warrants looking into. Look at how he controlled the pace of the game by calling so many Ticky tack fouls on DeAndre Ayton in Game 3. The only game all playoffs he's been in foul trouble. This is important because he's a very good defender without fouling. Giannis ran into DeAndre and Crowder a few times in the 1st quarter and Scott Foster blew the whistle making sure they got in quick foul trouble. This is important because he is only shooting around 40% when being defended by Ayton and something like 70% being defended by everyone else. Lol.  However, the fact that Bucks fans are saying that now the Suns fans will now have something to blame their finals loss on, while simultaneously saying the NBA is trying to extend the series is beyond laughable 🤣🤣🤣.  I think it's very clear that no matter who loses tonight, both teams are going to be blaming Scott Foster. Lmao"
Deandre Ayton never intentionally fouls. Never... I don't care if Ginny shoots freethrows. Just watch the foul calls this game. It will be absolutely nothing like that last game.
"Karl Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton (recently), Terry Rozier, Victor Oladipo."
"DeAndre Ayton, a lot of people think he's better than Shai or Bam"
See Deandre Ayton under ‘it takes a bit to figure it out as a young big man’.
LeBron also played against “third year deandre Ayton and played way worse than Giannis.” Perhaps it was lingering ankle issues but regardless giannis has been playing at an insane level with 2 way impact. Would have Giannis slightly ahead of lebron going into next year personally but of course lebron could easily change that
Yes I’m watching Giannis beat up on a third year deandre Ayton. If harden and Kyrie are healthy bucks aren’t in the finals and you wouldn’t be putting Giannis ahead of Lebron James.
"You don't have to like it but to say that there is ""absolutely 0 strategy"" and that 70s and 80s teams would ""demolish"" modern-day teams is your opinion - one that most likely will remain unquantifiable. But it really shows that you A) don't appreciate basketball and, B) miss ""the good ol' days of basketball."" I, like you, grew up watching 80s basketball and frankly even the Lakers and Celtics don't live up to the hype of their legendary conflicts - they played some really bad games every now and then. Don't get me started on how bad most of the 80s teams were. Bad games are part of any sport where you have to huck a rubber ball through a metal ring with other people trying to stop you.  I like professional wrestling and I'm familiar with modern-day performers, their schticks, and the type of wrestling that is popular today. Most pro-wrestling in the U.S. and Mexico is not my bag - so I choose not to watch it. However, I have taken the time to try and understand the modern-day version of pro-wrestling and after a sufficient period of time, decided it isn't my cup of sizzle.   I'd encourage you and your dad to give it another try but with an open mind. The Bucks haven't won a championship since 1971. The Suns have never won a championship. Chris Paul is probably a top 2 or 3 point guard all-time with one of the finest basketball minds I've ever seen. Deandre Ayton has literally improved before our eyes this season. And Giannis Antetokounmpo is a man with an amazing personal story of overcoming hardship, devoting himself to learning the game, and rather than chase a winning situation somewhere else last offseason, signed with the team that drafted him and is now one game from winning an NBA championship. I'll take this over most of what I saw in the 80s and 90s."
Imagine if the only guy Shaq had to worry about down low was    DeAndre Ayton    Lmao
"what…  i think ayton is a good match for the suns. of course, luka is better than deandre, but currently, a building block in the suns’ system is ayton’s ability to dominate in the paint."
"He was actually slim during his college days and before the draft (he was like 250 pounds), but then he got injured and just put on a bunch of weight and muscle. Sometimes I feel like he should’ve stayed at 250 pounds. He would basically be built like Deandre Ayton, and he’s still doing well."

Thabo is older than DeAndre Ayton
"Defensive specialists like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green, and Rudy Gobert aren’t exactly getting wiped off the floor. DeAndre Ayton, Julius Randle, and Giannis are all big men who don’t shoot much from outside. They are all doing pretty ok."
"Idk man wilt was a high-level sprinter. A big who can roll hard *and* defend perimeter players is very useful in today’s game. DeAndre Ayton seems to do just fine, and Wilt was faster."
"The only thing I disagree with you on is your edit at the end that says it'd be nice for CP3 to get a ring before he retires.  Fuck that.

DeAndre Ayton, Monty Williams, Mikal Bridges, Cam Payne, Cam Johnson and Torrey Craig all seem to be perfectly good dudes. I'd be genuinely happy for them if they pulled it off and won the title.  But Chris Paul? Fuck Chris Paul. That dirty cock-punching flopper deserves no championship."
"Cam Johnson, Deandre Ayton, Cam Payne, mikal bridges. some of the most likeable guys in the league. Look at cash considerations Torrey Craig and Cam Payne fighting his way back from China and the G league. DA growing up in the Bahamas then moving to AZ for high school, stays at the university of Arizona. Drafted #1 by the suns. Great story, great player, great fans. Go Suns"
"No one even suspected Daniel was in the trade until it broke. It was  all about what can the Raptors give SAS for Kawhi.  Siakam had very poor handles at the time and Poeltl looked like DeAndre Ayton when playing against the opponent's scrubs.  The bench mob era was crazy.  Our starters would play a tight game and then FVV, Norm, Delon, P, Jak would come on and push the lead to 20-30 points and then close out the rest of the game as garbage time."

"Honestly they are both such obscure small market yes, most NBA fans just picked a side based totally on the narrative.   I like the sound of Gianis emerging from being down to games, more than CP3 finally getting a ring.   I am a pretty big fan of Deandre Ayton after this playoffs, but I don't think it is their year."
I say what deandre ayton is doing is more impressive at his young age

"This starts with DeAndre I think. You can point fingers at almost everyone on Phoenix right now, but Ayton is usually their anchor. But right now can’t handle a ball, he’s not being aggressive, he can’t rebound, he can’t score. He looks lost out there, and that’s an issue because almost no one can fill the role he does at his best"
All I’m saying is I’ve never seen John C Reilly and DeAndre Ayton in the same room together
DeAndre Ayton is John C. Reilly’s son
Deandre Ayton shooting half court shots in warm ups lmao
Comparisons. I hate that somebody is always the next *insert legend here*. Hearing Devin Booker compared to Kobe and Deandre Ayton compared to David Robinson this summer made me want to lose my mind.
"Bruh, the Bahamanians are like a teeny tiny island, there is no way they will ever have a basketball team at the olympics.

Deandre Ayton averaged 14 and 10 this year. Marvin bagley averaged 14 and 7. They must be pretty close in ability . . .
"When asked to define what success in the NBA looks like to him, Deandre Ayton answered ""Definitely getting to my second contract; that's my success.""  Humble as a motherfucker -- possibly too humble, but I fuckin love this man."
"If Ayton became a US citizen then a 2021 team thats 100% healthy like everyone.... I would go with ..   Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton.  Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns.  Kyrie, Booker or Zion for the last 2 spots. 12 deep."
Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley would be great replacements unless DeAndre Ayton switches to team America
* I honestly thought that Bledsoe would become what Jimmy Butler is.  * Deandre Ayton is going to be better than KAT.
Shaq would be leagues above deandre ayton
&gt; He’d be similar to Deandre Ayton  This might be *the* worst take.

"“To me, the most interesting thing has been watching Deandre Ayton.

"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot—and Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee’s impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven’t won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship résumés, seeing all these new faces on the league’s biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul—these Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we’re getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography—elevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it’s a “down” year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he’s not among the NBA’s peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he’s only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he’s playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis’s signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday’s game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it’s astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis’s blunt power—these stars may be dissimilar, but that’s why they’re such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it’s tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee’s, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on “Booker game” everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points—though playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee’s Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they’re now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn’t see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There’s no asterisk to this title. There’s been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I’d take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the “bubble tournament” in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the “bubble title,” or this one. Come on. Don’t be absurd.   I have no idea what’s going to happen here, and that’s great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday—thanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I’ll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim—it’s hard to get a read on where it’s going. Phoenix’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don’t, and that’s the exciting thing. There’s nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there’s none here. We truly don’t know for sure who’s going to win it, and that’s the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He’s really something else."
That late game offensive rebound and put back over DeAndre freaking Ayton was amazing.
They had no answer for Deandre Ayton. A healthy AD would have dropped 35/15 on them nightly.
"Deandre Ayton is averaging 18.5 PPG in the series.   Ayton, Booker, Paul, Payne, and Crowder is five."
"What's also crazy is that Deandre Ayton and Giannis are essentially the same size at 6'11"" and only an 8 pound difference between them. Such an evenly matched contest in the air to decide the momentum of the game with little more than a minute left to play is an iconic moment."
"I'm under the impression that he just really wanted to go back to working with Doncic. This is why I don't understand why people throw out how unlikeable Doncic is lol. From all accounts, literally every one of his teammates except KP, have come out and said this dude is a great teammate.  &gt;“Luka Doncic was a big part of my coaching career and growth, he said. “He did an unbelievable job for Slovenian National Team. He will be a hell of a player in this league. So, good memories of Luka. I wish him nothing but the best. But Deandre is my son right now.”  https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2018/6/27/17506734/kokoskov-says-there-was-no-doubt-phoenix-suns-1-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic"
"Seeing a lot of people saying ""only AD"" or ""maybe Bill Russell"", well I present Exhibit A:  - 19 year old Pat Williams chases Booker around a screen, still at the FT line when the lob is thrown, recovers to Ayton while the ball is in the air, twists his body from the right to the left, gets up to 11-12' to meet Ayton at the rim and he doesn't just pin the it off the backboard, *he snatches it out of the air*.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDzD8c5t0N8  This is an incredible play by Giannis, but it isn't even the best block of a DeAndre Ayton alley oop this season. Crazy."

"Not saying that block isnt legendary but its still slightly different, deandre ayton 2 hands well above the rim vs tiago splinter one hand from a lower height."
"The Suns. Even though I can't stand Chris Paul and Giannis is my favorite player in the league right now, I kinda don't want to see the Bucks horrible basketball IQ get rewarded alongside their horrible coach. I also love Monty Williams, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and their style of basketball. I want to see the Bucks become a true elite championship team before they win. Even if the Bucks win I'll be really hyped, because small market teams desperately need a victory."
"well CLICK CLICK deandre ayton, this is your KODAK moment"
"Okay the refs were bad everywhere. It wasn’t the most impactful, but my personal favorite moment was when Ayton was called for a foul after Giannis slammed into him and Van Gundy said it was because Deandre stuck his chest out."
Anybody else think Deandre Ayton looks like John C. Reilly?
DeAndre Ayton defensive masterclass
DEANDRE AYTON OMG
Why the fuck are they inbounding to Deandre Ayton???
how the hell does deandre ayton have a baby face with a beard
deandre “better than bam” ayton with 6 points 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Said this to someone the other day. He may not be lighting up the stats every night, and some nights he still is, but it’s back to the age old discussion of is MVP just about the best statistical player or who is actually most valuable. If you take MVP to its definition, Ayton is by far the most valuable to this team. The Suns are deep enough that if CP or Booker couldn’t play one game, Payne or even Cam Johnson could fill the role, or either of them could pick up the slack for the other. But DeAndre is shouldering the whole load inside"
"The foul calls are so inconsistent. Giannis launches himself into Deandre Ayton and they call a foul. Giannis slaps Booker, no call."
"dude? wtf kinda question is this? deandre ayton is obviously the cutest bruh look at the guy he looks like a giant bubbly soft bear, i want to cuddle up to him and watch movies with him"
Deandre Ayton
"Realistic options: Christian Wood or Myles Turner  Unrealistic: Anthony Edwards, DeAndre Ayton, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"
Well DeAndre Ayton hasn't made an All Star team so....
"Deandre Ayton is around 43-44 inches so I think it's plausible Wilt was around that, but I agree that 48 sounds like an exageration."
"Yes, and apparently his dad didn't want anything to do with him until he was a top NBA prospect:  https://www.thefocus.news/nba/deandre-ayton-parents/"
&gt; how do I have no idea what I’m talking about   Because your argument is “I’d rather have Deandre Ayton than a top seven player.” That is immense stupidity.
"I've almost given up on comparing the eras because they are so drastically different based on, what you said, the combination of both the rules and tactics. The league seems to shift every 7-10 years, even during our lifetimes. I have fond memories of the Pistons/Lakers finals, the first Mavs/Heat Finals, the Spurs/Heat finals. All 3 of those series are drastically different from each other and from today. It's almost a different sport. I think it's confusing because it happens slowly so we don't notice a massive shift in real time. But jumping back and rewatching those games, it's obvious how different it was. Not saying it's better or worse, but not acknowledging the differences is just ignorant.   When former players complain about lack of toughness and defense, I wish they would show them videos of them not having to move like defenses do today, just waiting in the paint to grab inefficient shots or wild layup attempts. How many times in his life so you think Charles Oakley had to tag a rolling lob threat and them recover to a perimeter threat? Less than 5? It's completely different. Defense for someone in that era means something different than it does for someone like Draymond. Yes we don't stand in the paint and bang as much, but you guys didn't have to guard DeAndre Ayton, CP3, and Booker or the same possession in 3 drastically different spots on the court."
Bron raising his brows like that looks like DeAndre Ayton when he said “Jokic had 20 rebounds” 🤣
"Damn, what a good list.  I'd throw in Deandre Ayton, but I also think Kevin Love brings value as a veteran.  Think of him as a less tan Udonis Haslem with some more range."
cp3 second ever western conference finals which came off the backs of deandre ayton being phenomenal and  devin booker being great too. if you watched the suns last year you knew they were going to be good.   nets were still winning games while kyrie wasnt hurt vs the bucks. and kyrie literally had his best year ever this year. you are falling for the narratives.
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"Phoenix chose to put Crowder on giannis.  They had bigs, but giannis put ayton in foul trouble and Kaminsky is too slow. Atl had capela, the Nets had DeAndre Jordan.  The perception that the league has no bigs is false. None of them can match up with giannis."
"Suns big 3, mainly because I feel much much better about Ayton than DeAndre Jordan in playoff games.   I'm surprised by how many people in this thread are underrating the Clippers supporting cast during the Lob City era. Jamal Crawford won two 6MOY awards with the Clippers, and Redick averaged 16 ppg on 44% from three as a Clipper. They also had good contributions from Barnens, Mbah a Moute, Rivers, Collison, etc. during the Lob City run."
DeAndre Ayton too while we’re at it
"I really hope so. It’s such a shame we’ve never seen him and Lebron play competitively together. A team with Steph, Lebron, Klay, KD, Kawhi, Harden, Dame, Draymond, cp3, AD plus some centers, would be worthy of a dream team title, in my view.  Atm the best centers in the league are not American (maybe except AD when healthy, but he won’t play center, so…). But who could be the centers?  Bam, Deandre Ayton, KAT? Maybe Wiseman turns out good enough by then?"
"Unfortunately for the Bahamanians, Klay played for Team USA in the 2016 Olympics in Rio, which should render him ineligible to represent any other nation. There are some exceptions in the FIBA bylaws that could be pursued, the one that seems most likely to apply would be:  &gt; ...in exceptional circumstances the Secretary General may authorise such a player [who has represented another nation at the senior level after his 17th birthday] to play for the national team of his country of origin if he is ineligible to play for such country according to this article 3-23 and if this is in the interest of the development of basketball in this country.  I could see the argument that adding a player like Klay to their National Team roster could contribute to the development of basketball in The Bahamas. Having said that, it's not actually Klay's ""country of origin."" Mychal Thompson is the one from The Bahamas. Klay was born in LA and grew up back and forth between there and Oregon. So it's kind of a stretch.  But the Bahamas could still field a roster with Buddy Hield, Deandre Ayton, and some of the lesser Thompsons."
"And that the US fields a sampler platter of whoever is free after the playoffs that season. For a lot of countries, players good enough to play pro ball in the NBA or even in other major international leagues are hard to come by, so it almost pencils those guys in for a decade on the squad.  For the US, it’s almost like, “Who’s had a good playoffs and doesn’t have anything lined up? Can we get DeAndre Ayton out here?”  I know it’s not really as haphazard as all that, but Team USA ought to recognize that it really does need a higher degree of continuity and commitment. Assorted US/NBA talent might still be good enough to beat most/all(?) other national squads, but it’s clearly not good enough to win in a walk. And considering the gargantuan target Team USA has on its back in international tournament play, I’d appreciate if there were at least 4 guys who were 27-34 year-old NBA players who had made this commitment two years ago.  Not necessarily “For Old Glory, KD and Steph need to —“ blah blah, but Team USA should know they have a baseline of guys who’ve all been multiple time all-stars who can serve as starters in a pinch if not a reliable third rotation. Line up multi-year commits well in advance from, say, Paul George, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond, and Jimmy Butler. Easier said than done, I know, but I could see it being marketable to being a backbone of Team USA. Hell, if KD wins a third gold this year, I bet he’s back in three years to try for a fourth. But maybe it’s better for the squad overall if guys like Butler and Green had been vocal about returning from ‘16 once the 44 man finalist list was announced last February. Something."
" Antetokounmpo is 11-of-25 (44%) when guarded by Deandre Ayton.   Against everyone else, Giannis is 25-of-32 (78.1%)."
"Without looking at numbers I want to say he’s shooting better from the free throw line this series. Also, based off of measurables(size, strength, lateral quickness) Blake Griffin matched up with Giannis much better than Jae Crowder and DeAndre Ayton"
"Yeah no comparison if you’re operating outside of reality. “High level role player”, did DeAndre Ayton hit on your sister or something? He’s been unbelievable."
"Imagine seeing what having a real point guard and floor general has done for Deandre Ayton and the Suns, and not thinking that same skill set would help Embiid reach another level.   If you had Lowry you’d be in the finals."

I was shocked to find out Deandre Ayton is 22.  I wouldn't have been shocked if you told me he was 56.
"It sounds like your projecting onto Giannis a narrative that *you* want to exist. The truth of the matter is: you don't know what Giannis was saying. I know what clip your talking about and its not possible to be clear that he was ""pouting.""  I agree with your point about the Bucks needing to find the three ball. I'd argue that their Game 3 performance was indicative of an upward trend, especially with Jrue and Khris getting more involved. But you're kidding yourself if you think Giannis has nothing to do with that. He started the game with like five assists in the first quarter to get his teammates involved.  Also, your comment said nothing of Deandre Ayton's impact. If Ayton is in foul trouble, I'm dumping it to Giannis EVERYTIME. Ayton is the only player (maybe aside from Crowder) that can impact Giannis in anyway defensively. I don't expect the Suns to be this down bad in Game 4, but I also don't expect the bucks to get comfortable now either. They've come back from 0-2 before.  Your comment also implies that the Suns had a poor shooting performance based on their own inability to hit shots, but that's not true. The Bucks were taking away the three ball as an option. Booker was taking terrible shots and couldn't get into a rhythm. Paul was not as bad, but he seemed like a non-factor for most of the game. Both of these players were impacted because Jrue Holiday woke up defensively and the bucks never put themselves in a position to have Lopez on either of them.  This last paragraph is gonna be ranty, but what is ""The Man?"" What is that concept and why does it exist in sports. Being ""The Man"" is a completely relative concept that depends on *your* style of leadership. You could be a psychopath like Jordan or Kobe, or you could be more reserved and team first like Russel or Duncan. There are many different ways to win in basketball, and I'm sure that Giannis will figure out his way of doing so. I'm sure he's not worried about some random redditor's concept of leadership dictating how he's going to communicate to his teammates.  Edit: A word"
Deandre Ayton weighs 2000lbs.
"A few of my favorites:  Siakam stares down Nurse, and raises his arms straight out from his body Oh shit, here he goes again, everyone out of the locker room! Nurse barely manages to close and lock the door behind him. The team is pushing each other out of the way trying to look through the small window in the door, as Siakam starts spinning, rapidly gaining momentum. The steel doors of the lockers are like butter to his razor sharp spinning arms.    Deandre Ayton ain't no Passive big man underwhelming draft pick bust, he aint gotta screen and to ran back to defense like hes some lazy 3rd option bitch this aint Zaza pachulia this is a fuckin god human Shaquille O'neal come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy rollin to the basket and dunk a fuckin alley oop over zubac and fight you at the same time    A distinct blend of Degree deodorant (his sponsor) and the dankest shit in NYC. I once saw KD and his boy roll into Barclays Center for a workout. He crossed paths with head coach Kenny Atkinson (whom he was about to help get fired), and Kenny did a limbo-meets-Fat-Joe lean, as if to duck the whiff of weed. KD grabbed a couple rookies to get a run in, and the coach jumped on his bike to head home.    Kobe showed up at 5 AM, but Giannis had already been there since 3 AM. His sweat covered the gym floor at a level of ten inches. Kobe took that personally and didn't sleep nor eat for the next two weeks they trained together, which severely impacted his performance"

"The only answer is DeAndre Ayton. Without him, the Suns don't make it out of the first round."
Hard to say because of the difference in the way the game is played today but I'm going to go with Deandre Ayton
"Tangential since you mentioned it, but who are the top five shotblockers in the league currently?    Myles Turner   Mitchell Robinson   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Anthony Davis   Rudy Gobert   Joel Embiid   Clint Capela   Robert Williams   Deandre Ayton   Bam Adebayo"

Deandre Ayton to the Hornets. Our missing piece for the past several seasons is a competent center. Plus he fits in perfectly with our rising stars.

"&gt; Idk why everyone is so obsessed with Rudy developing a post game.  It's because the reason teams go small-ball successfully against the Jazz isn't that small-ball is inherently great, it's because they can get away with it on the defensive end. If you want teams to stop picking apart the Jazz' perimeter defense with the small-ball, you have to show them that when they run that line-up you're gonna at-will score on them at the rim. Rudy's lack of a post-game means that he can't reliably punish teams for running small-ball.  In the Suns-Bucks series there were a few instances where, when DeAndre Ayton was off the floor, the Bucks would run a line-up with Portis/Giannis/Lopez. Portis and Giannis are F/C but being generous you could say they ran a line-up with *three centres*. It worked so well because the Suns were still having to work for baskets, the Bucks basically had a monopoly on any rebound, and could score at-will in the paint.  Rudy isn't the problem with the Jazz *at all*, and he makes them a great team - but counter-intuitively Rudy developing a decent post-game could actually fix a lot of the Jazz' problems on defense, simply by making those line-ups that are hardest for them to defend too punishing for the opposition to run."
DeAndre Ayton is the benchmark?  he was clearly not on a bum knee either
How is DeAndre Ayton ugly?

[Here’s an article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.azdesertswarm.com/platform/amp/basketball/2018/7/13/17570390/arizona-nba-summer-league-deandre-ayton-sit-out-suns-allonzo-trier-knicks-stats) about Ayton sitting out the last game in 2018. I just googled a random lottery pick “summer league sit out”. It’s been this way for a while. I wouldn’t expect a high pick to play all of summer league.
"23-year-old teen, DeAndre Ayton"
"Edited my comment talking about the playoffs.  Lowry was injured so it's not exactly a fair comparison. It would be like comparing Wall's 2018 season with Lowry's. Or comparing AD this past playoffs to DeAndre Ayton (not saying Lowry is as much better than Wall as AD is to Ayton, just pointing out how the comparison during an injury riddled playoff run isn't fair). He had surgery on his shooting wrist. Despite that, Lowry was still a tangibly better defender throughout the playoffs."
Deandre Ayton isn't that good at anything besides defense.
Deandre Ayton scored 2 points in 0.4
"Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Brandon Ingram  Zion Williamson  Anthony Davis  Off the bench:  KAT, Ben Simmons, Deandre Ayton"
Kyrie Irving / Ja Morant   Anthony Edwards  Brandon Ingram  Ben Simmons / Zion Williamson  Anthony Davis / Deandre Ayton    tbh seems like it's mostly big men and point guards ... not a lot of wings to choose from
"So is DeAndre Ayton.  CP3 got a shit ton of undeserved praise this year.  He was good, but more the missing piece than the franchise altering player (like Lebron, Jokic, Giannis etc)"
"Unpopular choice maybe, DeAndre Ayton. I think he has the potential to be as dominant as Embid now. He's already good at low post. Maybe more development on mid-range jumpers."
"luka doncic, jrue holiday, jaylen brown, brandon ingram, anthony edwards, deandre ayton, SGA"
"No, a winning player is someone who, when they're injured or unavailable, their team performs objectively worse and when missing other key players, the winning percentage doesn't drop significantly (it's always expected that it will drop when you lose key players but to what degree?). Name a Kyrie team where that was true. You don't have to win NBA championships to be a winning player. Chris Paul is a winning player for example. DeAndre Ayton is a winning player. Jaylen Brown. Donovan Mitchell. There are plenty of them in the league. Kyrie isn't one of them.  Basketball is like the one team sport outside of being a QB where a truly exceptional player is capable of determining the outcome by themselves. This sub often acts like Kyrie is amazing and is one of those exceptional players, when he really isn't.  Like I said, it's a crazy take no one agrees with. But it's my take so I posted to answer the question."
"DeAndre Ayton. I think he doesn’t have the skills to become anything more than a complimentary guy on offense and his Defense is overrated. He’s a B+ defender but people were saying he’s a DPOY candidate which is insane, Still a good player who will make an All-star game or 2, but I don’t see superstar"
Wouldn’t he just be a better Deandre Ayton
"PG-Luka Doncic  SG-Jamal Murry  SF-Jerami Grant  PF-Tobias Harris  C-Deandre Ayton  Bench-Malcom Brogdan, CJ McCollum,Mikale Bridges,Aaron Gordan,Clint Capela"
"DeAndre Ayton. I know he was a first overall, but I think people still underrate him because he’s just never going to be an outside threat. I think his real ceiling is an MVP caliber player."
"Deandre Ayton. Only year 3. Defensive beast, lob catching specialist. If he can get himself some good post moves, which I really believe he can, he’ll be unstoppable."
Deandre Ayton will be a contender for DPOY and be 3rd team all NBA  Basically replace Gobert in those spots
No particular order   1. Luka Doncic  2. Zion Williamson  3. Brandon Ingram   4. Devin Booker  5. Jayson Tatum  6. LaMelo Ball  7. DeArron Fox  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   9. Jaylen Brown   10.

"As a Nuggets fan, the only ways MPJ is better than Murray in the next 2 years is if he either takes a huge unexpected leap this year or Murray comes back and isn't close to what he was.  I pray it is the former.  MPJ's issue is that he isn't improving very quickly.  He's going on his 4th year in the league (though he didn't play year 1).   He came in being able to shoot really well with a hand in his face from deep.  He can do that at an elite level now.   He came in being able to play atrocious defense.  Now it is a little below neutral.   He came in only handling the ball in a straight line.  That hasn't changed.   He came in not really passing.  That hasn't changed much.   He came in with a decent around-the-rim game.  That has gotten a bit better but still far from great for his size.   He came in with very good rebounding.  That is probably about the same, though it does seem positional (rebounds way better as the team PF vs. SF for an unknown reason).   He still can't take a handoff from Jokic and rise and fire.   He's gotten a little better at cutting away from the ball.  When I look at that list, I don't see a guy on his way to being the next Kevin Durant on anything but shooting.  KD is a defender just below all NBA and can run the offense through him on any team.  I'm not convinced any team will be able to run their offense through MPJ.  Part of that may be that the Nuggets want to win so keep MPJ from handling the ball much which has restricted his growth.  But the Nuggets also need a secondary or Tertiary ball handler... Deandre Ayton did a good job against Jokic, and no one else could make plays without Murray."
He didn't have cp3 or DeAndre ayton on his team he got that far tingus pingus that is an accomplishment by itself right there
"Spending more than the mid-level on a center, even the good ones, is a losing premise. Only the truly elite are close to value, and even then, I doubt that you can win a title with a center as your best player.      A lot of centers, i.e. DeAndre Ayton, are really talented, but it takes up too much money where a guy on a mid-level could give you probably 85-90% of the production. Meanwhile, that's money that won't be spent elsewhere."
"Not sure how unpopular some of these are, but I'll throw some out:  - **LeBron is the GOAT and the distance between him and MJ isn't as close as some think.**  Not a long argument for me. LeBron's all-around game is better, and he's doing better over a longer period of time, often with far less talent around him and during the basketball renaissance across the globe that's happened over the past ~15 yrs. that has made the level of competition greater than it's ever been.  Take a look at some of those Cavs teams that LeBron drug to the Finals. I think the Cavs' Finals win over the Warriors is more impressive than any of the Bulls' titles.  While I'm here, I think the distance between Kareem and MJ is closer than MJ and LeBron.  - **If not for Dirk, the Mavs would consistently be considered one of the worst run franchises in the NBA.**  The more that comes out about the culture behind the scenes the more it kind of makes sense why they could never land a big free agent, even DeAndre Jordan.  Subsequently, I think many consider Dirk one of the best to ever play, but I think - due to his ability to carry this team to so much winning despite the people running the team from Cuban on down, I think we may actually be underrating Dirk's greatness nowadays, despite how great we already think he is.  Their title v. the Heat looks even more impressive and makes me think higher of Carlisle too.  Suns will do fine with Ayton, and ATL is doing fine with Trae, so if it wasn't for the Kings being the Kings and not taking Luka, the Mavs would currently be recognized right now as one of the NBA's top clusterfucks of a franchise.  - **It may be time to for the Spurs to force Pop out in a polite way.**  First, let me say, I think Pop can still coach. I think the Olympics proved that. But I also think that's the better type of team for him to be coaching at this point in his career, an all-star level team or a team with several stars.  Obviously, all of us know what he's meant to the Spurs franchise, but Budz is gone, Ime is gone, and they may lose out on Becky if they don't set a plan in place. (Which, there doesn't seem to be one if she's still interviewing heavy for other jobs.)  At some point, especially for a franchise like the Spurs who may keep the coach a long-time, you need to be thinking about the future, and as someone who likes Ime and Becky (and thinks Budz and Brown may be a bit underrated), there just seems to be a lot of brain drain from the coaching staff in favor of keeping the oldest coach in the NBA.  - **The Jazz are one of the most overrated franchises in the NBA.**  Congrats on the Top 4 seeds, and consistency. Yes, consistently not mattering when it matters most. I think a lot of people in the media like that the Jazz make competent moves (they don't often hit big, but also don't often fail big), and the idea of what the Jazz could be, rather than what they are - consistently forgettable. Play the game the right way and all that.  Donovan Mitchell will realize this too and get tired of being consistently solid when he leaves in a couple of years."
Im dumb. For a second I thought DeAndre ayton got a suspension from the malice at the palace and I just didn't remember him being there.
"Hassan Whiteside is a good NBA player.  Jaylen Brown is better than Tatum.  Russell Westbrook makes the Lakers worse, Dennis + KCP + Kuzma is more value  DeAndre Ayton can potentially be the best center in the NBA by 2025"
"I wanted LaMelo and I really think GSW could've made it work by running three guard / LaMelo in the Harden-in-OKC role, but it also just made a ton of sense for them to take a flyer on Wiseman and try to put him in the DeAndre Ayton role: tons of potential but on a team of veterans so will start with a very limited role that will hopefully expand as he develops his game."
Deandre Ayton was the best choice at No.1 in 2018. The Suns needed a big man and defense and he helped them get to the finals. I've been trolled a lot for this opinion.
"I do wonder where 2015-2017 Deandre would stack up against today’s centres.   He’s behind Jokic, Embiid, KAT and Gobert but you could argue he’d be in the same group as Bam, Vuc, Ayton or is he lower?"

Safe pick: DeAndre Ayton  Bold pick: Lauri Markkanen
"Deandre Ayton, OG Anunoby, Draymond Green, Malcolm Brogdon, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jonas Valanciunas, Tobias Harris, Gordon Hayward nkt on the list.  I would take out Michael Porter, Collins, Ball, Edwards and replace them with Draymond, Hayward, Harris, Ayton.  But I guess the sentiment is correct and Id have Collins at least top 60"
“Young” deandre ayton is hilarious 🤣🤣considering he only 22 or some shit
Looking like young DeAndre Ayton
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
1. “Anyone who knows anything about basketball” knows that Jordan was better than Hakeem even though Hakeem was a great player. I don’t really feel like having this argument right now though.  2. Deandre Ayton is not nearly as good as Hakeem so this discussion is fucking irrelevant
\-someone who has never watch the Timelord play. He is really good. Dude just can't stay healthy. I was right about Deandre Ayton. I know that I am going to be right about the timelord being great
"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
DeAndre Ayton looks like he's 40

These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.

Well it’s not like Deandre Ayton is a scrub. He’s panned out pretty well for them after a couple years. Marvin Bagley is just…..not at that level
DeAndre Ayton is 17 but he still buys beer and cigarettes for Devin Booker when he forgets his ID.
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
"Probably to keep a promise that got him out of Spain. Plus looking around the league, the top teams are still playing true centers. DeAndre Ayton, Jokic, Golbert, Nurkic,  and that's just the west. Seeing how Giannis destroy the Suns in the post in the final, teams got to think about at least keeping the option of a guy like Gasol that won't get bump off the block."
"I think he is always a good source of entertainment and I value his evaluations of players even though he is definitely your classic over-reactor to intra playoff series narratives... Like he was starting to make David Robinson comparisons about Deandre Ayton and saying he was going to have to update his top 20 players in the league list or something silly like that. If you just ignore his over-reactions in real time, then most of the time I appreciate his post game pods as they generally do a good job of dissecting the forces at play. At first I didn't like him and Ryen Russillo together, but now I have really come around to Russillo to the point where I even listen to his solo pod."

JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.  They are noticeably improved from last season and still have plenty of money to spend.  **The Suns have to following line-up AND 15 mil to spend (plus a 4.5mil injury exception):**  Chris Paul, Cameron Payne, Ty-Shon Alexander      Devin Booker, Landry Shamet      Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson      Jae Crowder, Jalen Smith,      Deandre Ayton, JaVale McGee"
don't forget James Wiseman son of Deandre Ayton.  Warriors fan's and coaches are hoping he follows in his dad's footsteps defensively.
"Suns’ 2021-22 rotation:  Starters = Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton  Second Unit = Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, JaVale McGee  Phoenix made the NBA Finals and upgraded their roster."
"But you still have Wiseman, right? He's like DeAndre Ayton crossed with prime DeAndre Jordan crossed with prime Jordan Bell, right?"
- Me talking about DeAndre Ayton 3 years ago
"It's crazy how many people are comparing 22 year-old, barely-getting-started Ayton to early-prime Capela and absolute-prime Deandre Jordan like it's bad that he's currently only slightly better than them."
"In no particular order:  1.	⁠Giannis  Arguably the best player in the world today and he’s only 26. Unless he becomes riddled with injuries, it’s very unlikely we see him drop off in the next 5 years  2. Luka Doncic  Luka will be 27 and in the prime of his career. He’s already found his way into some MVP conversations at 22 and it’s not hard to imagine he’ll win the award sometime in the next 5 years.  3. Zion Williamson  The man is already averaging 27ppg in his first full season. I can easily see him improving over the next few years to become a top 5 player in the league  4. Donovan Mitchell  At 24 years old, Donovan Mitchell is already among the best guards in the league. When you look at Dame and Curry, and you compare their games from when they were 30yrs old to when they 24/25yrs old, you can see they improved a ton and really took their game to the next level. Who’s to say Donovan Mitchell won’t do the same.  5. Deandre Ayton  This ones a reach, I know, but it’s kind of boring if I make my list too safe. Don’t really have a good reason for why this would happen lol, but here’s my hot take: Booker and Ayton will start to get Kobe &amp; Shaq comparisons 5 years from now  Additional notes:  I could’ve put “someone who hasn’t been drafted yet” because there’s a great chance another Derrick rose or Luka doncic comes into the league (especially in this 2021 draft class), but I wanted to keep it to players in the league rn."
you're basically saying 90% of nba draft picks are busts then LOL     deandre aytons a bust relative to anthony davis     and anthony bennetts a bust relative to deandre ayton
"and the other one has lebron, curry, kyrie, and harden.  ps you have deandre ayton but he's not american, he's bahamian"
"I mean that’s just a flat out lie statistically lol. He had the 2nd highest usage rate and was the 2nd highest scorer.   And if you want to go the 2nd/3rd most valuable route, Siakam was his team’s Deandre Ayton in this whole player comparison.   Mikal is a 4th option 3&amp;D guy. Pascal is a legitimate number 2 scoring option on a contender."
"Bro, in a Draft with DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young and Luka motherfucking Doncic, they took Marvin Bagley with the 2nd pick.   And there's a possibility they give us Buddy Hield for scraps, who statistically, is the 3rd best shooter in the league the last 3 years.  Get outta here with the fucking Kings."
"There's only 3 players younger than Devin Booker in the current Phoenix roster. DeAndre Ayton and the two 2020 rookies. Yet, Book is the ""oldest"" Sun. It always surprise me how long he's been in the league for his age."
Is it better than Landry Shamet?  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Jimmy Butler * Ben Simmons * Joel Embiid * Kevin Durant * Kyrie Irving * James Harden * Devin Booker * Deandre Ayton * Most likely CP3
"I'm high on Mobley, but he said the same thing in an interview (that the player he models himself after is KD) and I dunno man. I know it's a shooting revolution and everything but it might be going too far man.  At least we have good ol' Deandre Ayton out here looking like a old man and playing like a traditional ass center."
"People were like that predraft and during the rookie season too. I like Luka a lot (a whole lot), but there were people who insisted on not only that Luka be a superstar, but that *everyone* else near him had to be a bust as well, to *punish them* for doubting Luka. They would *insist* that Deandre Ayton and Trae Young were busts and try to argue for it no matter what. That whole thing got uncomfortable."
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"

"his team played the third slowest pace in the league in 88, so adjusting for pace to the average in the league (about 100 poss per game, of which jordan played about 87.5 per game), and Jordan did the 2021 equivalent of posting 35/8.6/8.6 with 3 stls every game.  That'd put him 5th in assists, first in points, and 17th in boards per game, with almost double the steals of 5th place Jrue Holiday, and the same league adjusted TS% as Deandre Ayton."
You're right. DeAndre Ayton looks older.
"I valeted Gary Paytons car in Seattle a few years ago when KD had just joined the Warriors. I asked him what he thought about it and he just said ""Horseshit"" and tipped me $2...  DeAndre Ayton also stayed at my hotel for about a week for Jamal Crawfords pro am. Dude was cool as shit. Joked around with us for a while and gave us a $50 bill every time he came in or out. He was borrowing Jamals Mercedes. Jamal came a few days later to pick up the car and gave us another $100.  Carlos Boozer was cool too. Gave us $20 each time."

"Not that many teams had better defense than the Suns. DeAndre Ayton is one of the best at Defending Giannis in the league. They also have Jae Crowder who does pretty well defensively against him. I don't see a single team having a better combo than that, unless you make a case for Embiid. In which case he should of made a case for himself and not disappeared against the Hawks over and over lmao  Edit: looked it up and Phoenix had one of the best defensive ratings in the playoffs and a very good rating in season. Talking about elite defenses is odd because the only one that people can point to is Toronto, and that team does not exist anymore, and that was probably one of the better defensive 5s in playoff history. So it's a very weird thing to nitpick, considering the Suns were one of the best in the playoffs. And sorry but the Sixers lost in the 2nd round, so I guess elite defense only takes you so far"
"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.   I'd choose KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond, with DeAndre Ayton at center  For the bench I'd go with Mike Conley, Buddy Hield, Covington,  OG Anoubly, Capela, Joe Ingles, Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Fred VanVleet, Tobias Harris  Maybe throw in PJ Tucker instead of a big for a death lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, PJ, Draymond and just destroy teams offensively and defensively with intensity."

"&gt;I really think even after his Finals performance there’s been a hesitation from many to give him the respect  Because previous finals involves the potential ""all time greats"" going against other all time greats. Giannis didn't get to do that. He almost lost to KD when KD was missing $100,000,000 worth of players due to injury, and who came out of the West was vastly impacted by the unavailable superstars on the Lakers/Clippers as well as the unavailable stars on the Jazz and Nuggets.

"Okay. If Drummond was actually a good defensive big who could finish at an elite level at the rim off the pick and rolls, I wouldn't hear Cavs and Piston fans constantly talking about how Drummond is an empty stats player with trash efficiency. And he certainly wouldn't have gotten bought out by the Cavs instead of being traded if he was actually good at the things you listed. He would actually be a better Deandre Ayton, which he clearly is not.   And on top of that, he wouldn't have gotten only a minimum while Javale McGee gets a bigger contract than him after barely playing any minutes off the bench for the Nuggets. So not only is he not as good as you say (which most of this sub would also agree with me), he is also a headcase who thinks he is better than he actually is. Do you comprehend?"
"It’s a team sport so why are you judging Klay as an individual bc of something his team did? People always refuse to give Kyrie enough credit bc he’s only ever won with Lebron ahead of him and has failed to win on his own, but this logic doesn’t extend to Klay for some reason? If he fits well as a #2 and #3 on a great team that’s cool but that doesn’t mean he’s better than the guy leading a 50 win team as the #1 or 1a bc there’s different levels of responsibility and defensive attention garnered in those situations.

DeAndre Ayton.
"&gt; Even 1st overall picks aren’t guaranteed tbh.  They aren't *guaranteed* to succeed, but there is such a huge difference between #1 and #2. #1 picks average almost as many win shares as the #2 and #3 combined. Occasionally you get an Anthony Bennett but #1 has a very high likelihood of success.  Since 2000, the #1 pick has been an all star every time except 9 (so 57% all stars) and that's including Ayton who probably *will* be an all star and Anthony Edwards who it's a little too early to tell, but I still included all of them except Cunningham (ie, all of them who have actually played).  Of those 9 who didn't make an all-star game, I would argue there are only 3 true busts.  Kwame Brown: Bust  Anthony Bennett: Bust  Andrea Bargniani: Bust  Andrew Bogut: Still had a good career  Greg Oden: Injuries. If you want to call him a bust you can, but to me it's a little different if the guy's career is derailed by something like that versus just not being a good player.  Markelle Fultz: Injuries  Andrew Wiggins: Still a decent-ish player  DeAndre Ayton: Too early to say but *probably* not a bust. Seems really good actually.  Anthony Edwards: Too early to say"
"That's a little revisionist. Chris Paul only had one offensive explosion and that was game 4 with a whopping 18 points. Cam Payne, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton were the offensive threats for the series. Plus, Gasol was actually hitting threes compared to everyone else on the roster -- and Drummond was getting cooked regardless, so when both centers are defensive negatives, it's clear which one is better to play.  In games 4 and 6, Gasol's three point shooting helped the Lakers to close the 18-20 point lead that was made. It wasn't enough, but he made the games closer with his offensive presence."
"the truth is Zion is a great basketball player, he's gifted, but sports media needs a new LeBron and soon.  You're exactly right.

They NEED a new number one best player undisputed"
"AD struggled against Deandre Ayton, Rodman would’ve put him in Alcatraz lol"
DeAndre Ayton is a 7 footer and a very strong center usually lol who was fresh off of holding his own against AD and Jokic and dominating the Clippers himself. Not his fault Giannis was just on another level physically
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"

"Gobert scored more points last season than guys like DeAndre Ayton, Joe Harris or Harrison Barnes, people act as if he's some kind of second coming of Ben Wallace offensively.  He's a great role player on that side, he's aware of his limited skillset but elite at everything he does."
"genius idea, I can't think of a better way to encourage parity than to add DeAndre Ayton or Luka Doncic to the 2017 Warriors"
"DeAndre ""JJ Barea"" Ayton"
DeAndre “JJ Barea” Ayton
"DeAndre ""LeBron stopper"" Ayton"
Gobert does as good as most bigs do against Jokic lol. Only dude I've ever seen him actually slow him down is Marc Gasol back in Toronto and now DeAndre Ayton a little bit.
"It's the covid bump players. Trae Young, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton all got a pretty good reputation boost for being available when most of their peers were sick or hurt, but I think the biggest boosts went to **Jokic** and **Randle**.  Julius Randle is an elite player like Jokic is an MVP-- which is to say that his name is only coming up if 75% of the guys above him are hurt, sick, or both. They were prolific in the Covid-addled mess of 2020-2021, and so they got the attention. Now Jokic is pencilled in as an MVP candidate and Randle as an all-NBA level player going forward. Jokic is GREAT and Randle is GOOD, but we all know MVP and all-NBA, respectively, is NOT who those guys are."
"Got Kawhi, Cam, and DeAndre Jordan. These were some good ones!  Almost said Ayton for the one with Cam but I remembered someone posting Cam’s TS on this sub"
"his ESPN high school scouting report  &gt;Bagley has emerged as the best high school prospect in the game. At 6'11 with multi-dimensional skills and blessed elite athletic ability he impacts the game on both ends of the floor. His soft shooting touch, scoring instincts and ball handing ability make him unique at his size.   [he was the top rated player in his class, ahead of Michael Porter Jr, DeAndre Ayton, etc](http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings/_/class/2017/order/true)"
"Definitely well-below average compared to other championship teams.   It's hard to even say who their 3rd best player was. Probably KCP, because he was the only player that could consistently hit 3s. But nobody would have ever predicted KCP would be the third best player of a championship team.  Compare them to this year's championship teams. The third option for each team was Jrue Holiday and Deandre Ayton. Those are both All-Star level players.   That said, the Lakers had ridiculously good chemistry and had a lot of versatility. And the role players all stepped up. That doesn't always happen."
"Ah man, do I prefer the player who drags a team to the playoffs, leaves, and makes winning contributions everywhere he goes, or a team that is so bad historically that people think KAT is worse than Deandre Ayton? /s  Twolves don’t really intend to compete. If they wanted that DLO would not be their Point guard and they wouldn’t be interested in Ben Simmons. And that was what really fucked with somebody who actually wants to win in Jimmy; Wiggins didn’t improve, KAT slacked on defense, the entire team was a clusterfuck, so don’t put it on Jimmy when he gets pissed they shit in his soufflé."

"I've always been a Booker fan, these playoffs did nothing but confirm that he can be the best player on a championship contender (I see him as better than CP3 because first   * think of the team without Chris Paul (just inside the playoffs because they were 9th last year and got major upgrade in coaching) * think of the team without Devin Booker (basically no scoring, I respect Paul and Ayton but they aren't primary scorers on a playoff team)  So I've always seen Booker as the best guy on this team and I know that's a hot take because everyone says it was all Chris Paul but people are forgetting about the bubble??? I think the drastic increase in wins was mainly due to DeAndre Ayton's improvement and Booker's maturity. Paul was a minor factor. Sure he was a good player but Booker is better. Draymond could be considered the leader of the Warriors, the glue guy, and is obviously not the best player. Although he is a completely different Chris has a similar role in terms of leadership. Go ahead and put me on some delusional takes thread if you want."
"EFG% and more specifically TS% account for the extra variables you are tracking. TS% accounts for all three percentages and weighs them by respective attempts, as you can imagine people like curry and harden, who have not only high percentages, but also insane volume, do very well.  TS% is also pretty cool because you can more easily compare different styles of play, like demar derozan versus steph curry, versus Davis Bertrans versus domantas Sabonis. You still need the eye test to understand why they are different, it can be enlightening to know that joe Harris has a higher true shooting percentage than deandre ayton. (66 versus 65)"
"I’m a Suns fan. The absence of Jamal Murray is equivalent to the Suns without Devin Booker, so his injury was the biggest factor. Not sure what the outcome would have been if both teams were fully healthy but it definitely would not have been a sweep. Deandre Ayton didn’t outplay Jokic, but he contested him enough to prevent that from being a weakness for Denver to exploit and he held his own sufficiently. MPJ didn’t shoot well the entire series, I remember there being some speculation regarding his back and I can’t remember if he was playing through a back injury or not, but he’s still young and has a high ceiling with a ton of room to grow. And Phoenix was 100% healthy that series. CP3’s shoulder was back to 100% after injuring it in game 1 of the Lakers series and nobody was injured. That series was when the Suns kinda peaked during the playoffs and it was against a banged up team missing their second best player."
"Lmao damn can you tell me which 7 of Ricky Rubio, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Kelly Oubre, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, Aaron Baynes, Cameron Johnson, Jevon Carter didn’t belong in the NBA?"
Sure. But what about devin booker and DeAndre Ayton?
Nobody can defend Giannis but that's another big body to throw at him to keep DeAndre Ayton out of foul trouble. 😉
Deandre ayton
Deandre ayton.
Clint Capela or DeAndre Ayton
Ben Simmons vs DeAndre Ayton
Deandre Ayton aka The Bohemian Behemoth  It just rolls off the tongue so nice
I just had a look and Jae Crowder got an assist for his inbound pass game winner to Deandre Ayton in game 2 vs. Clippers this year (according to the espn play-by-play report)
"Idk what they are saying about only having 3 people for the suns lol we have  Cam johnson - 25 (Idk if 25 counts or not)  Mikal Bridges - 24  Devin Booker - 24  Landry Shamet - 24  Tyshon Alexander - 23 (2-way player, maybe actually on the roster this year)  Deandre Ayton - 23  Jalen Smith - 21  That’s 7 players, half our team 25 and under"
"Having Klay on the court automatically improves spacing because his ability to hit catch and shoot jumpers is likely going to be identical to pre-injury form, but the reason he was so great was due to his movement along with his all defensive level skills.  Wiseman last year didn't play in training camp and was forced to integrate into a high iq system with a superstar guard which is something he never had to do before. He was always the top option on his team and now he isn't even the top option when he comes off the bench. He was sloppy on offense and clogged up the lane for Steph to drive by calling for post-ups and turning it over or bricking, and ruined spacing, so Steph got all those crazy triple-teams at the three-point line. The second Wiseman got injured, Steph went on that scoring tear. On defense, he was too aggressive and fouled too often along with getting several goaltending calls, but this is definitely better than not trying on d at all.   He tried to do too much, but I think he can be much better this year. The warriors want him to be like Deandre Ayton aka a massive lob threat on offense. Steph + Wiseman pick and rolls would be much better than Steph + Draymond ones(which was about 95% of our plays last season) since Wiseman is a much bigger threat in the paint than Draymond. He didn't get a lot of rebounds due to being weak but he put on muscle so that's definitely going to improve. Hopefully, Draymond can teach Wiseman to be smarter on Defense. He can definitely be an Ayton level player especially considering he won't have too much attention on him since defenses have to focus on Steph(and hopefully Klay)"
RemindMe! 5 years  My 2025 top 20 list:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Jayson Tatum  3. Trae Young  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Donovan Mitchell  7. Ja Morant  8. De'Aaron Fox  9. LaMelo Ball  10. Cade Cunningham   11. Devin Booker  12. Bam Adebayo  13. Zion Williamson  14. Michael Porter Jr.  15. Jalen Suggs  16. Jalen Green  17. Darius Garland  18. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  19. DeAndre Ayton  20. Brandon Ingram
"Um the Suns?!?!?!?!  Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Eddie Johnson, Charles Barkley and Shaq.  Subs like Amare Stoudemire, Tom Chambers, Deandre Ayton, Chris Paul, Kevin Johnson."
Did you just compare Wilt to Deandre Ayton?? Lol Wilt was faster much stronger and would make Ayton look like Hasheem Thabeet
"DeAndre Ayton is great for a young center, but I watched the whole series and Giannis was just getting by him with ease. Jokic is a great passer and shooter, but I don't see how Jokic is even remotely better than Giannis or even Embiid at post scoring. The fact of the matter is to say that it's stupid as hell to say Harden has NEVER played better than Giannis' average that series.   Also, Jokic is the only top tier big in the west these playoffs."
Deandre Ayton with better Bball IQ is kinda what Wilt was.
"If the stories of his athleticism are true, Wilt would be akin to Dwight, or perhaps Deandre Ayton, only smarter when it comes to the game, with better passing, actual post moves and the ability to run point some nights. He'd be an alien."
Yeah NAW late season when he started averaged like 18 a game people got mad when I said a while back going forward I would have DeAndre Hunter and him in a similar tier long term but is what it is. Same thing with both you hope their most recent 15-20 game stretch carries over   How low are Wendell Carter’s odds because if they are low enough might put a few bucks on it   MPJ I could still see an offensive explosion happening to some extent. I agree SGA Zion types are waste of $$ for this. Ayton not a bad choice either   I also still like OG at +6000 may put down a few $$ on it. Rui I think those are good odds also.   Cam Johnson +6600 as a tota dark horse not terrible. I’m not huge on Gary Trent or Terrance Mann but once you get into +10000 territory it’s the type of thing worth looking at a little. Keldon Johnson +3000 and RJ Barrett +3000 a hair rich but both I might look at especially Keldon
"Idk whether I'm misremembering, but I swear people were calling Deandre Ayton a bust that wasn't developed enough till this most recent playoff run. I heard people calling him the Sam Bowie of the draft, rather than the Hakeem. But opinions flip quickly with young players."
"Cp3 needs to Deandre Jordan, Deandre Ayton. Still think Paul’s greatest accomplishment was getting DJ on the All-NBA First team."

Deandre “despite the loss” Ayton
"If DeAndre Ayton wants out of Phoenix next summer should the Suns just oblige him and let him go? Cause Lonzo was a restricted free agent, just like Ayton is gonna be."
"I didn't follow basketball back then but there are a bunch of trades I've read about in the late 90s / early 2000s that always leave me scratching my head. It generally feels like teams value draft capital and young players a lot more now than they did before.  For example the Raptors, a team that had just gone 16-66, traded Marcus Camby, a future DPOY who had just led the league in blocks in his 2nd year, for a 35-year-old Charles Oakley, who would average 8 PPG on 40.6% shooting with Toronto. Toronto had recently drafted Camby 2nd overall, don't think this was from Camby requesting a trade either.  Like imagine if the Suns traded Deandre Ayton after his 2nd year for Taj Gibon. I know Oakley was supposed to bring toughness to the team, but is this really the best use of your assets?"
"I've got one. On draft day of the 2016 NBA draft:  Phoenix receives Sacramento's 2016 first round pick (#8)  Sacramento receives two 2016 firsts (#13 and #28), a 2020 2nd round pick, and the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic.  It's not lopsided by any means. I think it would have been a wash if Bogdanovic never came to the league. However, the picks ended up just being a whole lot of bleh.  That 8th pick was Marquese Chriss, who has flashed potential on the Warriors fairly recently, but got pretty badly injured and hasn't played in a while.  That 13th pick was Georgios Papagiannis. We know how that one ended up.  The 28th pick was Skal Labissiere, who was almost projected for the lottery, but kept falling, and apparently for good reason. He's not on a team anymore.  The 2020 second round pick was eventually traded to Memphis on draft day 2020, and became Xavier Tillman (traded for Robert Woodard and a 2022 second rounder). Tillman's a solid rotation player.  -------------  Out of anything, the pick of Georgios Papagiannis is the biggest headscratcher out of this whole trade. Obviously, this isn't at the magnitude of picking Bagley over Luka, and that 2016 draft was kind of crap in the late lottery and mid first round. Honestly this was just a lose-lose for everyone. Both teams had been gunning to find their next solid big man. In recent history, the Suns used major draft capital to select Alex Len (2013), Dragan Bender (2016), Marquese Chriss (2016), and finally Deandre Ayton (2018), while the Kings had picked Thomas Robinson (2012), Willie Cauley-Stein (2015), Papagiannis (2016), and most recently, Marvin Bagley (2019). House SunKings indeed."
Better than the Suns who let Joe Johnson walk cause they lowballed him. Destroyed a championship level core due to cheapness   Now they’re making the same mistake with DeAndre Ayton
"All of his highlights are dunks, but he’s got a very soft touch around the rim and not a bad jumpshot. He’s a lot finesse-ier than looks and his rebounding can be really on and off. I like him as a bouncier Brook Lopez (before he became a legit stretch 5) or Valanciunas. Another one I like is Ayton. I don’t hate the Noah comparison either.  I was just commenting on the number of people just throwing out DeAndre Jordan just because they see the dunks."

"Allen is 31 of 37 to start the season. There's efficiency and then there's cosmic absurdity. Dude just does not miss shots.  His stats across the board are as good as or better than DeAndre Ayton's except he scores less on fewer attempts (although that's reversed so far this season), but somehow $20 million a year is an overpay for him but Ayton deserves a max."
Deandre Ayton in shambles
You must think Deandre Ayton dominated the Bucks then 😂
It's not worth taking centers high in the draft unless you're sure that they're gonna be legit stars. Case in point: Deandre Ayton over Luka Doncic
"I’ll take a different tack and say Kwame Brown.  Yes he was ultimately a bust, but the Wizards did him no favors but throwing him into the deep end with a perfectionist bully in Michael Jordan and a franchise in win-now mode with no interest in developing a teenager.   Imagine if he’d had an environment like DeAndre Ayton had or James Wiseman has now.  Maybe things could have ended better."

This is like trying to find a contract for deandre ayton at sarvers house
"I think the complaint is not so much as the lack of a foul call but rather the lack of a goaltending call against Deandre Ayton.  On a similar trajectory shot, Andre Drummond gets called for goaltending ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syOWS5yUYpM ) even though he caught the ball at almost the exact same spot Deandre Ayton caught it.  Personally, it doesn't matter to me if it's technically goal tending or not; I would just like the refs to be consistent in their calls."

"Without thinking too much about it I feel like the Suns have a number of guys you could slot into it.  CP3 (About as pure PG as you get)  Tyler Hero (Not really big enough for the 3, lacks the handle to be a 1)  Mikal Bridges (Can't really play the 4 much, not really a 2 either)  Tobias Harris (Would struggle to slot up or down for too often)  Deandre Ayton (Can't really play him anywhere but center)  It would be a good team. While no 1 guy is super versatile positionally they fit the molds really well and would mesh well together. SF/PF is really tough because they're so swappable these days. I'm sure there's probably some better picks for this that I'm not thinking of."

Deandre Ayton hitting 3s bro
"ah yes, there's sub-max player Deandre Ayton"
He looks better than Bagley so I have hope. The baseline for Wiseman right now is to help the team in defense so at least the rim protection of Deandre Ayton or smthing. But he has nice athletic ability and has a bit of finesse. Would take Giannis levels of space dedication to fully hit his ceiling.   Imma have to evaluate him soon when he gets back on the court. We also signed Kenny Atkinson and a bunch of assistant coaches that would develop Wiseman so that kinda helps.

"You can tell Ayton does not have the potential of harden from pretty much watching. It may but it doesn’t look like that outside game or ball skill is gunna come along, it’s what everyone was predicting when he was first drafted but as the years go by it seems less and less likely. Honestly his FG% raised bc he started shooting less, and CP3 is perfect for a game like him who needs assisted shots a la DeAndre Jordan."

"He's improved somewhat but in my opinion not a whole lot for a guy from age 19-22.    Anthony Davis went from decent starter to all-star in that time frame.  Gobert went from not really playing to starting all the games and leading the Jazz from 29th to 7th in defensive rating.  Deandre Jordan went from scrub to starter, Draymond went from draft afterthought to the reason the Warriors cut bait on David Lee, a borderline all-star in his prime.  Ayton has gotten a little better but I think you'd expect more growth from someone over their late teens/early twenties, especially if they were looking at his ft% in college and hoping he'd develop some perimeter skills."
We would not trade for Deandre Ayton just to pay him the max
"If Deandre Ayton plays more or less like he did last season, as in a good young player but not like a star or anything, do you think the Suns would match a potential max contract offer in RFA?"
"And like I said, Al Farouq Aminu.  The league also changes quickly where players who you thought were locks to stay put are now forcing their ways out. Being able to salary match just to get in discussions for guys like DeAndre Ayton and Ben Simmons is a plus. Perhaps you can find other teams to move Tucker to to get back picks to send out to the Suns and Sixers to help make trades work. It's always better to have these guys on your roster"

"This article seems to agree with you...  **Is Deandre Ayton worth the max?**  Only four true centers in the NBA are making the max: Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. Include part-time centers like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo and the list still remains very exclusive. These are MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, NBA champions, and NBA All-Stars we're talking about here. Thus far, Ayton has not crossed any of these thresholds.  The going rate for centers in that next lower tier down is substantially lower. Clint Capela and Myles Turner are both making less than $20 million this season, and they were meaningfully better regular-season players than Ayton last year. Capela finished sixth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and Turner finished ninth. Ayton didn't receive a single vote. Capela out-scored and out-rebounded Ayton in the regular season.  Of course, Ayton has only played  three seasons, and while his pre-draft pedigree alone shouldn't guarantee him a max contract, it does suggest more room for improvement than a typical 23-year-old NBA player would have. That upside was visible in the postseason, when Ayton grew into the sort of elite play-finisher and defensive anchor Capela was all season for the Hawks. If Phoenix believes he can maintain that form, he's immediately worth more than Capela.  The top group of centers encompasses players who are either elite shot-creators (Jokic and Towns), elite defenders (Gobert and Adebayo) or, in the rare cases of Davis and Embiid, players who are elite in both areas. Ayton might one day enter either or both of those groups, and there might be teams willing to pay him on the hope that he does. For now, he's a tier below."
"PHX just signed Bridges and Shamet to deals, which is more than enough a signal. Same with Paul. That's 65MM+ in FA deals this summer applied to next year, all for bringing back their players. Play well in PHX and you get paid. They maxed Booker. I can't really be convinced this team simply won't spend.  I also can't take you serious indulging the Kobe deal. Deandre Ayton is so far from Kobe that I have nothing else to even say about that.  Ayton acting more selfish this year will only affect his ability to get the max. I'd hope his agents stress upon him that he does not have the leverage he thinks he has. I will bet you any amount of money he doesn't take the QO as it would be a horrific life decision"

Trade him for Deandre Ayton
Imagine saying that Deandre Ayton has a strong face-up and post game lmao you can't be serious this is embarrassing where are all you nerds coming from who clearly haven't watched this dude play basketball
"Sources: DeAndre Ayton asked Robert Sarver to pay him today. Sarver refused. Ayton asked again. Sarver said no again.  Ayton then told Sarver he should go to hell, and Sarver dropped his pants and pointed to Suns fans, who are already there."
" DeAndre ""Rajon Rondo"" Ayton"
"Given that players like Lamar Odom and Pau Gasol would probably be making over 30 million a year if they were playing today in their primes (2006), no. Well I think that DeAndre Ayton is potentially more impactful than a player like Lamar ever was, I think that Lamar Odom was over paid.  Ayton should probably be looking at somewhere around 20 to 25,000,000 a year"
"Giannis, Giannis, Jokič, won last 3 MVPs, both bigs from Europe with a lot of skills, Embid also came close to MVP if he played more , also a big with a lot of skills.  &amp;#x200B;  Just because US bigs are like Dwight Howard or Deandre Jordan Or Ayton with all the strenght and size and muscles and no skills or BB iq and bad footwork it doesnt mean that other parts of the world cant produce BASKETBALL players. You in US are so determined to label and box everybody as a big wing etc, but you should be more focused on making basketball players no matter if they are big small fat athletic. Everybody needs to learn ALL THE SKILLS from young age and only after they are 18 they should get a possition they will play ."
"Now I'm just waiting for the inevitable ""Sources say the Los Angeles Lakers are interested in signing Deandre Ayton"" post."
So um I've only watched him in the playoffs..never saw him in regular season.   How good is he really?   For instance like Red Velvet was awesome in the playoffs but the reason he signed a 4 year $65 mil deal I stead like a 5 year $125 or 5 year $100 mil deal is because during the regular season he's great but like he's not Trae or John Collins.  So in that respect. How good is DeAndre Ayton actually. Is like a killer in the regular season?
"Yeah, didn't follow the West too close, but the Suns won the Pacific handily beating the two favorites, the Lakers and the Clippers. And the Suns were the 2nd seed in the West behind only Utah, which had the best regular season record in the entire league. Guess we'll see how this turns out...     **Contract talks between Phoenix Suns and Deandre Ayton end without agreement**   Ayton wanted a full, five-year, max contract, worth a guaranteed $172.5 million. Phoenix raised the possibility of a shorter maximum contract deal -- perhaps over four years instead of the full five years -- but they never formally made any counter offer at all, sources said. Ayton can enter restricted free agency next summer, and sign an offer sheet with another team that would still give the Suns' matching rights. Ayton could also sign the $16.4 million qualifying offer to play out the 2022-2023 season and become an unrestricted free agent in 2023. In that scenario, the Suns risk losing a franchise cornerstone player for nothing."
"Suns are crazy not to pay Ayton they are so fucked without him. Last season Suns only had ONE player average 5 RPG or better and it was that's right Deandre Ayton with 10.5. Their second leading rebound by total was 6'0"" Chris Paul."
"The Suns made a massive self-error by making the Ayton contract into a blob of drama. Even with the Kyrie and BS nonsense, they managed to get the pot stirred.   Think carefully, Sarver… are the Suns better with the higher salary bill, or no DeAndre Ayton?"
"Then he can prove that this seasons. So many players have gotten heavy contracts after one playoffs and didn’t live up to it. Ayton got better with CP3 like every does, DeAndre Jordan was all NBA first team with CP3. He’s a big that’s a great defender but not the best and limited offensive skills seeing how he does for another y against the full teams makes 1000% sense. If he does well u match whatever max he gets, if not, well no love lost."
Literally just be DeAndre Ayton and score 20.
"when my future son becomes an NBA player, I'll make sure to not name him DeAndre and marry a woman who's last name is Ayton"
"If someone is unwilling to pay talent, then they shouldn't own a team. Do I think DeAndre Ayton is actually worth a max contract? Not at all. BUT that is what the market has said players of his age and skill set get so they should sign him instead of letting him walk or trading him and getting 60c to the dollar."

"So after helping the Suns get to the NBA Finals for the first time in 20 some years Ayton doesn't deserve a raise? Hmm...    &gt;PLAYER	2021/22   &gt;   &gt;Devin Booker	$31,650,600   &gt;   &gt;Chris Paul	        $30,800,000   &gt;   &gt;Deandre Ayton	$12,632,950"

"Even if he did, your ceiling with Deandre Ayton getting the green light is losing in the first round lol   If you're a big and you can't shoot, pass or have otherworldly post scoring (like literally Embiid level), you better be setting those screens and catching those lobs because you provide no other value on offense lol. Ain't no one giving the max to someone to chuck up 45% post hooks all game"
What does Deandre Ayton mean to you?
I think Deandre Ayton deserves a lucrative extension guys.
"jesus christ the suns haven't lost since fucking october, calm down now.  this defense is just too much, you got mikal bridges who might be the most terrifying perimeter defender since spurs kawhi, deandre ayton is one of the best perimeter guarding bigs, cp3 might not be the defender he was in his prime, but he can still get a crap ton of steals and play solid defense. you throw in jae crowder who is a great defender and it's a nightmare. this suns team was not a fluke, they did get a little lucky in the playoffs, but that's most finals teams. if both teams healthy i think this could be the western conference finals matchup, with the only other team maybe getting there being the lakers if lebron manages to rebuild his own team at the trade deadline."
All those Suns fans who love to shit on Deandre Ayton in our game threads I hope you have a terrible night’s sleep and step on a Lego first thing in the morning
Deandre Ayton just took a massive shot on Robert Sarvers desk
If Book didn’t go out it would’ve been a 20 point game tbh. Our defense shut Curry down. Say hello to Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton.
great block by sub-max player deandre ayton
Love me some DeAndre ayton
Deandre Ayton is so good. Pay him you cheap fucks
DeAndre 'oh I'm getting my fucken max' Ayton
"Sorry but that's dumb as fuck, if you think that Javale is a more effective defender than Deandre it's because you don't follow basketball. Ayton protects both the rim and the perimeter better, and he's switchable in a way that Mcgee and most centers aren't"
"Teammates plural?  Our third best player is Patty Mills lol  Other title contenders' third best players are Jrue Holiday, Klay Thompson(when he comes back), and DeAndre Ayton  We have the much better #2 of course but thanks to Kyrie we pay a big price for that from #3 on down  If anything you seem to be obsessed with reiterating that the Nets are favorites just so you can clown us if we lose"
"**PG:** Ja Morant, Lamelo Ball, Seth Curry   **SG:** Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Lauri Markkanen   **PF:** John Collins, Evan Mobley   **C:** Deandre Ayton, Myles Turner, Clint Capela    Championship contender, idc what you say."
"Dejounte Murray, Tyler hero , Harrison Barnes, Og, DeAndre ayton.   Bench. Jonas, Mikal bridges, lonzo, MO bamba, Cole Anthony."
"While I still think the suns did the right thing by telling DeAndre Ayton to prove he's worth a max contract...giving Ayton the max would have STILL make more sense than giving MPJ his max. I thought, well shit if MPJ gets it (which I thought was crazy then) there's no way DA doesn't.  MPJ was set for life with his Rookie contract, and now he'll get multi-generational wealth while having a high likelihood of never playing to his true potential. 172 Million dollars in disability, blows my damn mind."
"I dunno, Phoenix literally just did the opposite of what you are saying with Deandre Ayton."
Phoenix literally just did this Deandre Ayton.
"Tatum for Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton, and Jalen Smith? Money works. Suns pair Booker and Tatum for the foreseeable future.   CP3/Booker/Tatum/Crowder/McGee would be really good  Brown/Bridges/Ayton as a young core fits a lot better than Brown/Tatum"
"With help from 3 blind  🐁 , straight up giannis can’t bulldoze DA like he does the Majority of the league, DA is too big too strong too quick and too long DA got straight Hooed by the refs and the NBA and still almost prevail through all that bs and this year The Phoenix Suns and Deandre The Great Ayton will avenge that travesty and disgrace and Rise higher than ever and will become the 2021/2022 NBA Champions"
I think getting guy like Nurkic for cheap price give you higher chance at title than giving max contract for someone like DeAndre Ayton  if you want to win title then max contract should be up there only for all-stars.
"Oh damn, this sounds like what he does for DeAndre ayton..."

"James Harden,Bradley Beal,Zach Lavine and Deandre Ayton  You never said realistic"
"uh huh, in the same way DeAndre Ayton is a perfect fit for Phoenix"
Feels like the Suns management should just lock in DeAndre Ayton at this point. This core is clearly legit and he’s a valuable part of it. Why play around with him anymore?
"Because there are a whole bunch of morons out there convinced that he's a DeAndre Ayton-level player without a shred of evidence to back it up. I'm not saying that all Wiseman supporters are unrealistic (I didn't like what I saw from him during year one, but the same goes for Jordan Poole and look at him now), but the guy definitely has his share of unreasonable stans, especially over on /r/warriors."
"I think they would better embid in olajuwan,   Better zion in Charles Barkley,   a pick and roll demon in Karl Malone with more floor spacing.   An aggressive David Robinson instead of DeAndre ayton. The nba would look ridiculous.  Larry bird game is a taller luka. I don't see magic Johnson or  kevin McHale doing good a"
"Yea a 5 year max from the team that drafted you is 1 year longer than a 4 year max you can get on the market so yes, the contract ends sooner and the player could leave earlier.   You brought up Deandre Ayton as an example, saying the suns are making a mistake giving him the ability to leave earlier so they should give him the 5 year max, all the while ignoring that they straight up don’t want to give him a 5 year max. If they don’t think he’s worth a 5 year deal (he’s not) why is it bad for them to let him get an offer sheet and match? You said because it damages the relationship, which I haven’t argued with. But 4 years is a long enough time to repair that, and I gave you an example of a player who signed elsewhere, was matched, and is now happy with the team that matched."
"Deandre Ayton.  Really good player, and continues to improve. He looks better this year. But look at the suns board after any loss in the past few years, and it was all about how passive he was, had no post moves, couldn’t dribble, and that he refused to dunk the ball.  And he was picked ahead of Luka."
One DeAndre Ayton please
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14.

"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"Yeah, refs said, you know what will definitely make the Suns win?  Giving Deandre Ayton 2 quick fouls for breathing too hard on a defender in the 3rd quarter to make him sit out till late the in the 4th.  The free throw disparity was a GIANT 3!  Cavaliers shot 17 more 3 pointers than the Suns.  You don't get fouled on 3's.  Attack the rim more and get more foul calls.  It's not complicated.  Did the refs make the Cavs shoot below 70 percent from the free throw line too?"
Holy fuck Deandre Ayton is getting sonned by Fro so far
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
"I don’t know why people keep saying this, it’s false. It wasn’t even with KOC, it was with HoopsHype. It was prior to the lottery and Fox just listed off people he grew up around.  HH: I know you’ll be representing the Kings at the NBA draft lottery on May 15. Are there any prospects you’ve gotten a chance to look at and who stand out to you?  DF: I mean, there are guys like Michael Porter, Marvin Bagley III and DeAndre Ayton. There are a bunch of guys who I grew up seeing just because they’re only one year younger than me.

in order of importance  1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Deandre Ayton  5. JaVale McGee  6. Cam Johnson  7. Cam Payne  8. Jae Crowder (Dario Saric if he was healthy)
Well DeAndre Ayton is a young center and shouldn’t be the one doing 30% of the offense. That leads to him getting injured which often happens to these starting star centers (see Philadelphia 76ers in 2021 second round of playoffs).   You need a star power forward and star point guard in today’s league to succeed. If you guys traded ayton for a star forward I might think the suns are a championship team.
"Chris Paul and DBook are both All-NBA players so far into this very early season, yet DeAndre Ayton was the best player on the floor tonight. Just beautiful"
"13 straight!!!!! This one…. whew. Why is it always the Spurs??? Lets get back to blowing teams out, plz  Having Deandre Ayton, someone who can be the best player of a game on any given night, be the 3rd best player on your team… whew. The days of 3rd option Josh Jackson are far, far behind us now. Love the aggression of DA tonight, fantastic back to back games out of the big fella.  When Booker is hitting his 3s like he did tonight and playing defense like he did tonight, he’s a top 10 player. It’s really that simple.  The individual players on this team have been so damn inconsistent this year, yet we have consistently gotten 4-5 good performances every single game, which is all you can ask for. Mikal was an absolute nothing all game until the 4th, glad he finally woke up. This was one of CP3’s worst games of the season imo, when he’s not distributing well while not looking to score in the first 3 quarters, he becomes a negative. Luckily that won’t happen much. Cam J shot poorly, but he’s been on fire recently and played good d, so he gets a pass.   Cam Payne is finally starting to find his groove, and oh boy is that nice. As reliable and safe feeling as the starting lineup is, I love the run and gun style we play with Cam at point. Feel like it’s perfect for how many amazing off ball threats we have, and when Cam is hitting his jumpshots it’s as formidable as any starting lineup.   The additions of McGee and Shamet continue to show themselves to be legit. Another off ball threat and a rim running finisher, couldn’t have asked for much else… other than a small ball 5 please and thank you."

One DeAndre Ayton and we just might consider it
"Wiseman said the same thing about going to the G, also Kuminga is more of a PG type player hes always gonna pass and move better than Wiseman i think wiseman just needs to work on setting actually effective screens rolling and catching lobs on the offensive side and i think him getting stronger over the time off will help his defense/rebounding a lot he was getting pushed around too easily, Centers always take a lot longer to develop too but i dont thinknits crazy to think he can be at least a Deandre Ayton type talent in a few years"
"He has a lot of potential but he was straight up stupid last season. He fouled too much on defense, called for unnecessary post ups, and clogged the three point line up for Steph. He got injured in early April and we all know how April and May went for Steph. Defense will likely improve with experience, but offensively he just has to be a pnr lob threat like deandre ayton"
"He could be. He could be DeAndre Ayton, who similarly had a rough start.   Honestly my post was mostly influenced by how many Warriors fans I’ve seen who are so down on Wiseman, especially last season. I recall many fans saying he should have been straight up benched or sent to the G League. That must be especially pronounced now that the Warriors have the best record in the league without him.  I guess there’s a hope he comes back and just fits right in, but that’s no guarantee. What would the reaction be if, by mostly coincidence, the Warriors go on a losing streak when he comes back (and one they would have gone on regardless)?"
So...Deandre Ayton Ewing Theory?
"&gt; In suggesting that having Sarver as the face of the franchise will impact how the Suns play, Rose said during ESPN's NBA Countdown last Friday the team owner called Deandre Ayton ""a lazy N-word.""

""And to be clear, ESPN has never reported that Sarver used those words to describe Deandre Ayton.

"If you’re the worst defender among Chris Paul, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, and DeAndre Ayton, that doesn’t really say a ton tbh, you could range from pretty good to atrocious. Booker is closer to the pretty good end."
"not DeAndre Ayton, that's for sure."
"DeAndre Ayton is repping Suns gear on his Instagram story. Ayton was celebrating Frank last night. Jalen Rose is out of the country, but espn had to apologize on his behalf for making stuff up about Sarver and Ayton. Maybe your head is in the sand my friend."
I wish I cared about anything as much as you care about defending Deandre Ayton in every single thread about him lol it's so weird man
"Frank and McGee have been great in his absence. Just like Capela, DeAndre Jordan and Tyson Chandler. Wow Chris Paul is so lucky with his big men. Kaminsky and Ayton should definitely get the max"
DeAndre Ayton doesn’t play for the Suns.   Deandre Ayton does.
" How lucky is Chris Paul with his big men? Had a dominant Tyson Chandler, Deandre Jordan, Clint Capela, and now Ayton, McGee, and Frank on one team! They all deserve maxes"
We’ll trade Christian Wood for Deandre Ayton
"Jalen Rose said that Robert Sarver called DeAndre Ayton a ""Lazy N-word"" but I guess there is no proof to back this claim so ESPN could have been hit with a defamation lawsuit."
Deandre ayton needs to be the focal point of a team
"Your title is false due to pronoun-antecedent issues.  Jalen Rose did not report that Robert Sarver called him a ""lazy n-word.""  Jalen Rose reported that Robert Sarver called Deandre Ayton a ""lazy n-word."""
"a lot dont, especially when you play 100 games between May and February. you need to rest as much as possible in the off-season before aau  deandre ayton didn’t lift weights until he got to arizona according to sean miller   and then you tell me if BJ Boston was hitting the weight room in high school with regularity lol"
"I agree, though I think he'll be better than Bagley just because he actually tries. I feel like the optimistic outlook for Wiseman is a DeAndre Ayton comp, while the optimistic outlook for Lamelo is Luka Doncic. Ayton is great, but give me Luka. And it's more likely Lamelo reaches 90% of Luka's level of production, in my opinion, than that Wiseman reaches 90% of Ayton's production."
DeAndre Ayton played in Seattle?
"Nah, he's a known dick in the area. DeAndre Ayton and Jamal Crawford were cool as fuck though and never gave us less than $50. Carlos Boozer gave us $50s as well. And Ziggy Ansah gave us $100 when he signed with Seattle from Detroit."
Wait why is calling deandre ayton DA dumb? That’s just his initials lol
The fuck is a JPL? This is stupider than when people started calling DeAndre Jordan DAJ or Ayton DA... Like it takes one less stroke on the keyboard to type JPL out than it does to type Poole.
Jokic was dominated by Deandre Ayton last year…
Idk as a suns fan I’m dealing with the opposite scenario of having a good young core player in Deandre Ayton not getting his money. I wasn’t aware that they didn’t really have much obligation to max MPJ so that is questionable. I think a one year offer to MPJ to let him prove he can sustain his level of shooting is definitely a good idea though.
"Any good center honestly. I’m not quite sure that he’d make us championship contenders, but someone like Deandre Ayton would make us so much better it’s not even funny."
"Holmes is a great small ball center off the bench but as a starter he gets absolutely bodied by opponents.  He's a terrible defender.  Now Ayton isn't a max player, he's far from it.  But Holmes isn't better than DeAndre."
Deandre Ayton.

"&gt; Deandre ayton is someone I feel is near plateauing and he’s gonna be a low end of a high grade important player, but initially I thought he’d be a star  Deandre Ayton put up 20/11 on 65% TS in college which is the best 1 and done production for a center I have ever seen and is more productive than Joel Embiid, Greg Oden, and KAT for example. Even the critics of the Ayton pick thought he would still put up David Robinson or Patrick Ewing production but ""that type of player isn't as beneficial in the modern NBA"" and his defense will hold him back. I know the Suns are doing well, spread the scoring around, and play at a slow pace, but no one thought he would be putting up 15 ppg in his 3rd year."

"They really aren’t that similar to be honest. Deandre Jordan took around 85% of his shots from within 3 feet, whereas Ayton has taken just under 50% of his shots in his 3 years in the league.   Ayton has a mid range game and can shoot FTs, areas that Jordan has never been able to do. Jordan has always been an absolute monster at the rim, whereas Ayton has more of a finesse game with a soft touch.   The only thing these guys have in common is their name, the fact that they play the same position, and that they’ve played with CP3."

If deandre ayton weren't picked right in front of Luka he'd be talked about so much more.  Holy fuck what a solid player
Deandre Ayton playing the 2K strategy where I just stand in the dunker's spot waiting for a pass out of a double team.
Deandre Ayton also averages a career 2.5 free throws per game lmao not crazy he had one with 0
deandre ayton is a role player? Press X to doubt
I mighta drafted Deandre Ayton too early in fantasy this year but next year he's an all star. BOOK IT
Deandre Ayton is becoming one of my favorite players his playmaking ability is insane
Fun fact: DeAndre Ayton can't miss
DeAndre Ayton is so good man
Deandre Ayton a career 95% FG in the playoffs.

Deandre Ayton is shooting an astonishing 93% so far this series
"I just hope Deandre Ayton begins to ""Dominayton"" Davis again tonight. Fuck that dirty shit bro."
DeAndre Ayton looking like an emotional lesbian
Bro it’s Deandre Ayton not Hakeem Olajuwon
"Laker are matched up with a traditional big against the Phoenix Suns with Deandre Ayton. If Gasol is playable against a traditional big, why is he not playing now against Ayton instead of Drummond. I think that Vogel does not think highly of Gasol."
"Half this sub ranks Bam as the 4th best center in the league. If you said a week ago that Deandre Ayton is a better player than Bam you’d have been downvoted to oblivion. I get that Siakam had reason for the criticism, but it’s not like Bam gets no praise"
"It's not just positioning. Wiseman right now doesn't have a great feel for the game and the intuition you'd hope for in a top draft pick.  The Warriors front office were also surprised by how slowly he developed throughout the season.  Deandre Ayton for e.g. while bad in his rookie season was no where near as negatively impactful as Wiseman &amp; Ayton showed a lot more promise and development in his rookie campaign too.  Evan Mobley who tbf probably will end up playing PF also looks like he'd be a way, way better PF/C than Wiseman straight out of the gate.  Wiseman is an athletic freak no doubt, and a high character guy, and he was my preferred pick at 2 as well but damn GSW would be so, so much better with Lamelo/ Tyrese Haliburton"
"Deandre Ayton has had multiple stingers in almost the exact same spot this season. He usually looks like he tore his rotator cuff or separated his shoulder or something and is in pure agony. Then checks out of the game for like 15 minutes, then comes back in. Ayton played an OT game earlier this year almost one-handed. After a day of rest he looks 100% next game. Obviously CP3's is not the exact same, but I'm hoping his stinger is similar to Ayton's in that he looks fine the next game."
"DeAndre ayton drops 44 pts and 21 rebs, booker drops 39 pts. Chris Paul 9 pts 7 assists 3 rebs.  How chris Paul willed the suns to a game 2 victory vs the lakers.  What next."
reminds me about how he [messed up an early sponsorship tweet of his](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2782156-deandre-ayton-tweets-instructions-on-how-to-send-call-of-duty-promotional-tweet)
"Drummond has his problems, but AD was the biggest dumpster fire of the night, by FAR, all on his own. AD usually is the help defender around the paint and usually on the elbow.. he just let the Suns bully him all night. He let Deandre Ayton take him out of the game completely(🤦‍♂️) and make him shoot garbage ass midrange jumpers that bricked all night long. Not once did he ever even think to try something different, or to fight back, or to make his presence felt. He played 39 minutes of garbage time. What a complete waste of time. I don't understand why this guy comes out so disinterested in the game so often but enough is enough."
"Classic feel out game from LeBron, not worried about him at all. LeBron will do LeBron things.  However, I am very much concerned about AD. He doesn't look interested at all and hasn't all season. His midrange isn't falling yet he refuses to move away from it and start posting up and attacking the basket more. Quite frankly, he needs to stop being a baby back bitch and start playing the 5 and being more willing to take contact. Drummond at the 5 isn't gonna get you far.  Devin Booker was AMAZING. Getting to his spots with ease. We've all been wondering what for years what ""Playoff Book"" will look. Safe to say I'm not disappointed.  Deandre Ayton is legit. He was bullying AD on the glass and in the post, at only 22.  CP3's injury is definitely something to watch moving forward. He couldn't control his dribble that well after it, which is highly unusual for him."

"To add to his horrific finishing, most of his shots are at the rim and his FG% is 53% or so. That is awful!   It seems like his personal box score numbers matter to him a lot more than his team impact. He’s the exact opposite of Deandre Ayton."

DeAndre Ayton absolutely played like a first overall pick tonight
"Deandre Ayton, monstrous performance"
Deandre “fuck AD” Ayton
"This really hurts the Lakers chances of sweeping us. In a game where nearly everything that could go wrong for us did, we still looked to be in total control. Fucking love it.  I hope CP3 is okay. If he was able to play at all, then it probably isn't anything too serious, so I'm staying cautiously optimistic, but he looked rough out there. In better news, I'm so happy I finally got to see Booker with his first empty stats playoff game. And DeAndre ""Bust"" Ayton with a casual 20/15 while shutting both AD's down.   GG LA. You guys looked tired as hell from the play-ins. Keep that energy.  Edit: Book in his first playoff game sets the record for highest scoring playoff game in Suns history. Empty fucking stats."
No. 1 Pick Deandre Ayton
ayton just beat the shit out of ad all day. deandre played like the battle tested vet and ad played like the young rook
DeAndre Ayton playing this well means Phoenix can compete with anyone. So happy for Phoenix.
Anthony Davis isnt just playing bad Deandre Ayton is shutting him down  We are going to start a dialogue
Deandre ayton showing why he was the right pick at number 1 this game

If Deandre Ayton is playing like this good luck beating this Suns team.

Deandre ayton sonning Davis. Dominating that match up

I swear deandre Ayton looks like he just stepped out of a time machine from 1982
Lost in all this is how nice deandre Ayton is. Lookin like a number 1 pick tonight
Deandre Ayton
Theres no fucking way DeAndre Ayton is 22
honestly i was one of the people who thought the suns had no chance winning this series. but if devin and deandre ayton can consistently play like they have today they honestly could win the series.
"Sorry, we all literally forgot about DeAndre Ayton. For seemingly obvious reasons."
Deandre smh Ayton
Lakers getting killed by DEANDRE AYTON
DeAndre Ayton looks like he enjoys peach slices
"Oh my bad thanks for letting me know. As for raising the age limit, I think it's the only solution to raise the profile and level of talent in the g league, and might even improve college. Also might prevent losing talent to foreign franchises. Think if lamelo was in the g league the last few years, but someone like DeAndre ayton got to develop more in college"
Sir DeAndre of Ayton.
Ayton of DeAndre
Same but with DeAndre Ayton
"If it comes to that i assume it would be a closer series than the 2017 Finals were for example, but i wonder if we will see the best version of the Lakers. Playing Phoenix with a LeBron James that isn't 100% might be the Lakers downfall and if DeAndre Ayton is able to do something against AD to slow him down, look out.  Imo if the Lakers beat Phoenix that means LeBron is 100% and if they beat Phoenix they will obliterate Denver/Portland and win the West against the Clippers, but LeBron being 100% is a big if, he missed a lot of time and didn't get alot of reps before the playoffs."
Deandre Ayton
"I dont see anything wrong with gettin DeAndre Ayton, especially since they needed a center more than anything else, and Ayton is a fantastic player imo."
"Your argument is that Anthony Davis is scared of Deandre Ayton, I don't think it's super strong buddy"
"Yeah they have great defense but Lebron and AD need to be truly healthy to win this series, the suns have a lot of weapons on both ends, and I don't believe for a second Deandre Ayton, one of the best defensive players in the league, won't play solid defense on AD especially if he's not healthy. AD is one of the best scorers of all time and going to get his no matter what, but Ayton is probably one of the best people to defend him"
1. Devin Booker  2. Chris Paul  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Jevon Carter
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
7: Deandre Ayton -&gt; George Mikan  Gotta look over some real old players to stretch it further.

Aside from DeAndre Ayton no
I can see it going to 7 and being close. I honestly think it all comes down to Deandre Ayton
Deandre Ayton. Love his defensive growth but he’ just shrunk offensively and has a tough time with anyone guarding him that’s 6’9 or above.
deandre ayton is absolutely *stupid* in 2k21 for series S / PS5  i’ve had him grab 1-handed rebounds over wilt and rick smits in blacktop
"so deandre ayton was awful two years ago, mikal bridges were awful two years ago, they both improved tremendously each of the last two seasons, but monty should get no credit and all the team's improvement was just CP3 and regular development. lmfao clueless."
Its cool you have no idea what I have watched.  Deandre Ayton was horrendous two years ago.  Absolutely Horrendous. They were talking about Bridges as an unassertive bust.  This turnaround is about the players.   Who I have seen play through multiple seasons.  And i expected a finish of 4th or so before the season due to that and Chris Paul.  Many people did
"Suns only had 4 top-5 picks over the last decade.  2013: Alex Len (5) 2016: Dragan Bender (4) 2017: Josh Jackson (4) 2018: Deandre Ayton (1)  The Suns have actually had a lot more draft hits in the back half of the lottery than the front half: Booker (13), Bridges (10), Cam Johnson (12), and even TJ Warren (14)."

Where was Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton picked at? And how many good seasons did they have before old man Chris Paul had to show up and got them into shape? Dudes teams have 1 good regular season and they get big heads
"Zach Lowe's a fucking hater man. Dude has enjoyed a lot of revenue shitting on the Knicks over the years.  And quite frankly, the only necessary argument for Thibs over Monty is so simple to me, a fucking casual could conclude the same logic;  - Phoenix Suns projected win total, and seeding: ~35 wins, top 8 (lower half) West team  - NY Knicks projected win total, and seeding: ~22 wins, bottom 5 team *league-wide*  CP3, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges?  Before the season, nobody would have dared to compare Julius Randle to *any* of them, let alone anyone else on our squad. Look at our talent comparison on paper? Lmfao please dude, what a joke.  Fuck Zach Lowe, and fuck anyone that seriously considers Monty Williams over Thibs for COTY (excepts Suns fans, cause bias, can't blame em lol)"

"&gt; Nah, the plan was for him to play significant minutes from the start because they wanted to “develop” him.  Nah.  The plan was for him to play significant minutes in tandem with Chriss and other big men . . . you know, what we were doing before the injury.  And then ease him into a bigger role if he did well.  &gt; First, centers typically adjust to the NBA the quickest.   Not trying to be a dick, but this is not true and not sure why you think it is.  Typically centers adjust to NBA play the **slowest**.  There are definitely outliers, but maybe this is where your unrealistic expectations come from?     &gt; Two, Wiseman was really, really bad. Not like, man DeAndre Ayton kinda sucked his rookie year bad. But really bad.  Don't disagree at all. Tossed into a shortened pre-season and shortened NBA season with limited practices/injuries/COVID, a dude with no college/professional experience didn't do very well when we started him against seasoned NBA centers.   &gt; And yeah, his lack of experience could explain some of that. The problem is, you would still expect someone with limited background but huge potential to progress over the course of the season. Go from incredibly bad to just typical rookie bad. Wiseman did not. He basically regressed as the season went on.  This is why your expectations are out of whack. None of what you wrote is crazy wrong, but it's wildly unrealistic when put together with the context for the season.  Wiseman has played 39 games of professional ball.  He was injured/had COVID in between those.  He barely played with a consistent line-up and had limited practices b/c of the shortened season and no real preseason.  He may very well suck and be beyond coaching.  But he hasn't played enough for you or me to gauge.  You need to hope for Giannis-like development of a raw player.  Not expect Shaq from a 18-19 year old with no professional or college experience."
"Nah, the plan was for him to play significant minutes from the start because they wanted to “develop” him.   And yes, I did watch the games, and have watched plenty of rookie centers. First, centers typically adjust to the NBA the quickest. Two, Wiseman was really, really bad. Not like, man DeAndre Ayton kinda sucked his rookie year bad. But really bad.   And yeah, his lack of experience could explain *some* of that. The problem is, you would still expect someone with limited background but huge potential to progress over the course of the season. Go from incredibly bad to just typical rookie bad. Wiseman did not. He basically regressed as the season went on."
Deandre Ayton.
DEANDRE AYTON WITH THE JAM!!!!!!
Deandre Ayton is prime example of not giving up on developing big man like James Wiseman
I LOVE DEANDRE AYTON
My current best casual fan doesn’t give a fuck/know a fuck roster:  PG: Jamal Murray   SG: Norman Powell  SF: khris Middleton  PF: John Collins  C: Deandre ayton
"Sit DOWN MPJ, sit down, son. DeAndre Ayton teaching MPJ a lesson."
DEANDRE AYTON OMG
"It’s almost like hitting 41% of your 3s instead of 28% while not getting better looks opens up the offense substantially! I mean it would be one thing if Thibs got Randle much better looks or something, but even Knicks fans recognized that the biggest difference between the regular season and the first round is that Randle just stopped hitting those contested shots that he was hitting all year, the offense didn’t actually improve.   Who improved???? How about Cam Payne going from out of the league to one of the best backups, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton, Cam Johnson, and Jevon Carter? Ayton’s offense didn’t take a step back, he just got less looks because our offense was an incredibly well oiled machine that didn’t rely on him to get shots like we needed out of him the previous two years... thanks to Monty. And then I know it’s tough to gauge defense if you’re not watching a team, but Ayton has gone from a very below average defender his rookie year to our defensive anchor and most important defender... in the two years under Monty.  It’s wild that your argument is that... our players didn’t improve... but we went from the 17th best record to the 2nd best record. Could that be... coaching????? I mean I’m sure you’re going to respond with CP3, despite the fact that the first round clearly, clearly showed that our team’s success isn’t dependent on CP3."
"I feel like you're really downplaying what the Suns did this year.  2nd best record in the league, 26-11 vs playoff teams, and they did it in the Western conference, which was a much more difficult schedule.  &gt;and it's a miracle that the Knicks are as good as they are whereas that's not really the case for the Suns.  Once again that really undersells the Suns. The suns were only projected to win 37 games.  The Knicks won 19 more than oddsmakers had them doing, but Phoenix also won 14 more, so they were pretty close.  &gt;Deandre Ayton improved a lot from last year to this year,  Is that suppose to make Monty's case less? Because wouldn't Ayton's improvement be a testament to Monty as a coach?"
"Because the suns have Devin booker who is better than any player on the bulls and the bulls are not going to add one of the greatest point guards of all time to their roster next year.  Deandre Ayton was the first pick in the draft for a reason, he's still coming along but he is showing signs of a player who can be one of the best centers in the game.  You think the bulls are going to make a huge jump, but who's going to do it?  You can fantasize all you want but you need to have some realistic reasons if you're going to make a post about it.  Trae is a better player than anyone on the bulls and they have solid pieces at every position.  The Knicks have good defence and a coach who is defensively gifted.  There is no reason to expect the bulls to make a significant leap even with everything you mentioned, they will still have sizeable holes in their roster."
"That's ""old injury prone Chris Paul"" ""#1 bust DeAndre Ayton"" and ""empty stats Devin Booker"" to you."
"Monty’s case was hurt by how good the team was IMO. It’s harder to give credit to the coach when you have guys like Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and especially Chris Paul on your team.   Meanwhile, the Knicks had the largest leap in season W/L % in the league while barely changing their roster. It’s just harder to argue against that compared to Monty’s case.   I wouldn’t have been mad if Monty got it given the sophisticated style the Suns play and the way he motivated that team to excel this year. Really got the best out of his roster and would have deserved the award."
Devin Booker is better than anyone on the Knicks. DeAndre Ayton would start. Stop it
&gt;PG - Trae Young   &gt;   &gt;SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   &gt;   &gt;SF - Luka Doncic   &gt;   &gt;PF - Michael Porter Jr.   &gt;   &gt;C - Deandre Ayton  IDK I still think Brooklyn is scoring 199 pts on that team 4 out of 7 times.
Okay. I’m obviously an idiot because that shit *still* doesn’t make sense to how it relates to the 2021 Phoenix Suns.  Is Deandre Ayton going to body Mike Conley into the scorers table in game 6 of the WCF?
"DeAndre Ayton.  Was as impactful as Booker in the first round.  Our offensive tattooing with him off the floor is atrocious.  Still gets thought of as the guy drafted before Luka.  Despite setting the record for most efficient player in a playoff series, ever, with over 50 attempts.  His defense is truly all defensive team worthy.  He guards all 5 positions.  Not just ok defense though, he statistically lowers the shooting percentage of the player he is defending, no matter what position he defends.  There is no mismatch.  He runs the floor, as well, if not better, than every center in the league."
"Nobody likes to play with a ball stopper, for sure.  The biggest problem is that KP is also a ball stopper.  He needs to find his inner Kevin Love or DeAndre Ayton.  Even though he's good enough to be a #1 he's nowhere near good enough to be a #1 on a championship contender, so figure out how to set great screens so you can pick and pop and crash the f-ing boards."
Yes. Deandre Ayton guards Jokic the best out of anyone in the league.
Giannis and deandre ayton
Him and deandre ayton ( even if he used drug)
"Just popping in to note that both DeAndre Ayton and Trae Young have made the second round before Luka Doncic. Pretty interesting, if you ask me!"
"You know what, I'm changing to your stance because Deandre Ayton does guard wings and is actually good at it"
Pretty much anyone drafted to the Suns by Ryan McDonough not named Devin Booker or Deandre Ayton.
Deandre Ayton downvoted and has left the chat.
Deandre Ayton is really good for being a 22 y/o center.
DeAndre Ayton is definitely better than Andre Drummond.

Deandre Ayton and talen Horton tucker are the co goats for oldest looking young dudes.
"Same as you mentioned, Deandre Ayton. I have about 7 years on him and he looks significantly older lol."
Every day DeAndre Ayton ages a year. The man looks like my daddy and can't rent a car
"Devin Booker, Cam Payne, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Chris Paul"
"To be fair, they had Deandre ""AD stopper"" Ayton."
"Deandre Ayton and Al Horford. Al Horford is the go to player that is often compared to with undersized and not freak athletic but talented prospects. Ayton has excellent size/length/athleticism so this comparison sounds off. However Ayton plays a lot like early career Al Horford. I first noticed this when I was trying to find other centers that were bad at getting to the line and Al Horford was one of the few that fit. Both don't explode and play physical basketball, Horford because he can't and Ayton because he just doesn't. Horford also was an excellent scorer but was never a 20+ PPG scorer and Ayton hasn't done this yet so far. Horford was also a good switchable defender and Ayton has this as well. Horford got even better at passing later on and developed 3 point range, I don't think the comparison to Horford will necessarily stick as the years progress."
And this is the guy who Puma gave a signature shoe. Puma also signed Deandre Ayton.
"Do the Lakers win if they swapped Jared Dudley with Devin Booker, Andre Drummond with DeAndre Ayton, and Dennis Schroeder with Chris Paul?"
1.	Cam Payne 2.	Devin booker 3.	Chris Paul 4.	deandre ayton 5.	Mikal bridges 6.	Jae crowder 7.	frank kaminsky 8.	cam Johnson 9.	Dario saric 10. Lebron James
"This will make me sound like a homer of course, but the sun's have the most balance.  They had the best record in the NBA against teams that made the playoffs this year.  They have a center who can guard all five positions unlike Gobert.  In addition Ayton is much more versatile on offense.  Sun's also added Torrey Craig late in the season who is a very undervalued pickup especially against a team like the nets who have wings for days, which is what Craig is good at defending.    The sun's probably have the best player in the league when it comes to attempting to defend harden and Durant in Mikal Bridges.  I also don't know what the nets are going to do to defend deandre ayton."
“Yeah screw you 1984 draft!” - deandre ayton
Wtf I love Deandre Ayton and the Suns now
"LeBron, Carmelo, Bosh, and Wade were all drafted in 2003 and all will be in the HOF.   1996 had Iverson, Ray Allen, Kobe, Steve Nash plus Marbury, Peja, and Jermaine O'Neal (plus an undrafted Ben Wallace). Five Hall of Famers that year.   1985 had Ewing, Mullin, Malone, Dumars, plus Oakley, X-Man, AC Green, Terry Porter, and Sabonis (first time).   1984 was Olajuwon, Jordan, Barkley and Stockton.   Anyway, I'm mad at DeAndre Ayton now."
"Said Chris Paul, DeAndre Ayton, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, Cam Payne, Cam Johnson......"
Is that Deandre Ayton dude injured from [that hit](https://streamable.com/lef9sa) or what?  I think it happened early in the 3rd quarter.  Did he play much or well after that?  I googled but didn't see any updates on it.
"Why? This series has been extremely chippy with a lot of dirty plays(Booker and Crowder pushing Schroeder out of the air, CP3 kicking Kuzma's ankles, AD's nut shot to Crowder), CP3 crying about Scott Foster after he lost, and a lot of shit talking  on both sides and the game tonight didn't exactly end on good terms. The suns were being poor winners and the lakers were being poor losers.  I'm surprised any of the opposing players went to talk to each other. Deandre Ayton is the only player on the suns I still like after this series."
"I still remember at the begining of the season Ayton roll into CP3 and ruined the play. Now Ayton is setting Tyson Chandler, Deandre Jordan level screen. Your team is something special. I hope you guys can make a very deep playoff run."
That son? DeAndre Ayton
"Did you somehow not watch the game OR look at stats? He absolutely dominated the entire Lakers team. 47 points on 22 fucking shots. 15/22, 8/10 from three, 100% from the line, 11 boards and 3 assists. You are an absolute clown if you can't realize how great of a performance that is, especially against supposedly the best player in the league. Lebron even had plenty of help today. KCP, THT, and Schroeder were all great today.  Let me remind you that this was literally the first ever series for Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton, and they absolutely demolished the defending champs.  Again, miss me with this ""in a couple of weeks shit"". Like I already said, yeah, they very likely will not win it all. When you smugly message me if they get eliminated, it's not going to be a surprise.  All I'm saying is that they have a chance. You're saying it's impossible."
[That's future all star Deandre Ayton](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/deandre-ayton/)
Deandre Ayton has been one of Giannis' best defenders.
DeAndre Ayton is the anchor of our defense. Hes a big mufugga who clogs up lanes.
"Chris Paul, devin booker, Jae crowder, deandre Ayton had a great series. Extremely impressive play from all of them"
"That's fair, my point is more, AD in particular was known to not be 100%, people weren't sure if that meant ""15-10 in 25 minutes"" or ""Straight up unable to play"". The former means a battle of a series but a decent shot of a Laker win. The latter meant Deandre Ayton was going to obliterate the entire Laker front court and LA was dead on its feet."
Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton have never lost a playoff series in their entire careers.
how this man deandre ayton 8 feet tall and got THREE!!!!!!! rebounds against this lakers team?
"They should, he made Ayton into a prime DeAndre with a jump shot and free throws."
Ayton is just soft. Deandre day-to-Dayton. He is weak.
"Deandre Ayton has looked lazy or hurt this quarter, yes I know LeBron cheapshot him."
Devin Booker has more rebounds than DeAndre Ayton lmao
If Ayton did that to lebron they would put deandre in Guantanamo bay.
Deandre Ayton is so well rounded as a player
Only reason we didn’t make the playoffs last year was the 25 (or 30?) games suspension for DeAndre Ayton
"Imagine being Deandre Ayton and your first two playoff series you gotta guard Anthony Davis (for 3/4 games) and Jokic.  DA is gonna grow up big time, regardless of win or lose he's getting some serious playoff experience."
This is a very horrendous take lmao. Especially “he lost to Deandre Ayton” 😂😂😂
&gt;Deandre Ayton Is Playing the Best Basketball of His Life    Didn't he just finish his third year or something? It'd be pretty weird if he was regressing
I hope you guys realize that today Adam silver is going to be going all out for the lakers.   There is no way that he lets LA die out in the first round.   Deandre Ayton will foul out in the first half.
"DeAndre Ayton is not worth the same money as Luka Doncic or Trae Young, sorry. He's performing well against a garbage Lakers front-court. In reality his offense is abysmal and his defense/rebounding is marginally above average.  Joel Embiid has offense. KAT has offense. Ayton is not even close."
"Start Beal, Bench Booker, Cut LaVine  ...  Clint Capela, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton"
"Giannis put up a 70 win pace last year with khris as his number 2 option.   His teams are pretty much always 3 point shooting beasts because you cannot stop him without a double and an all defensive big or oversized wing.  I’ve seen him stopped playoff time by the raptors (fluke), the Celtics having the flukiest season of all time (hortford was a top defender in the league that shut down embiid too), kawhi+gasol+siakam together, and Bam+jimmy.   AD made the playoffs 2 times in his career as a number one option.  I’ve seen him get plastered by deandre Ayton.   These 2 are not the same."
"Yeah Suns best lineup that year was a rookie Deandre Ayton, a rookie Mikal Bridges, a rookie De’Anthony Melton, Devin Booker and a chronically hurt TJ Warran. We were giving JIMMER FREDETTE minutes that year lmao"
Hey maybe they'll catch another break like they did last year and   Devin Booker will get a paper cut and Deandre Ayton will have burnt his tongue on some soup and thus be ruled out for the rest of the series.  Plus maybe Ja3 Crowder will lose his car keys and miss the flight to LA for game 6.
stop it man  that’s so disrespectful to Deandre Ayton   Ayton was literally playing the tuba in the Bahamas when some scouts thought he would be a good basketball player  the cat flies across half the world so he can play basketball in San Diego.   dude didn’t even have a lifting program until he went to Arizona.   played power forward at Arizona bc Ristic couldn’t move a lick and he almost lost his #1 pick spot because of it   Ayton has gotten better every single year and his defense is legit game changing at this point   Ayton really has the potential to give you 25/13/5 with All-NBA defense on the other end. and it’s because he’s a world class athlete and because he has put in the time to get better. not bc of Chris Paul
"And if you want to go next level, get your “Deandre Ayton made the finals before Luka and Trae” post ready."

"On the other hand though, Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton have never lost a playoff series"
I know DeAndre Ayton didn’t fill up the stat sheet tonight but by the eye test he was an absolute monster on defense. He is improving at a ridiculous rate and is still only 22.   Also shout out to Cam Payne for being incredibly aggressive as soon as he checks into the game. He is such a disruptive presence on offense for the Suns that the Lakers don’t seem to have an answer for.
And DeAndre Ayton only has 3 shots?
1. Cameron Payne  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul   4. DeAndre Ayton  5. Jae Crowder  6. Mikal Bridges  7. Frank Kaminsky  8. Torrey Craig  9. Dario Saric  10. Jevon Carter
deandre ayton first coming out party during his drug season was dominating trezz. once before he got suspended and once after his suspension was over. ayton demolished him ever single time
DeAndre Ayton looked 40 when he got drafted lmao

DA! Deandre “the district attorney” Ayton! The DA with a 100% conviction rate! The verdict? GUILTY! AD IS GUILTY OF BEING TRASH! DA THE AD KILLER!
"Thank god Ayton makes his free throws, else Drummond would be playing hack-a-deandre from the get go. Of course, he'd also foul out by the 2nd quarter, but there would be little of value lost for the Lakers at this point."
"You're still not getting it.  I am not saying Ayton is outrageously skilled at all.  Quite the opposite.    &gt;You guys have only won games Booker has done well in. Aytons performance means nothing to ur teams success.   Game 4 says otherwise.  And you might have missed Ayton's 17 boards, made partly possible by Davis being out.  &gt;And I find it funny that you brought up that he shot 80%. Insinuating that Ayton creates his own shot. It would be like bringing up that DeAndre Jordan shoots 70%.  When did I insinuate that?  I am simply saying that even if you get past the Suns and their raw center (which would be largely due to CP3's injury just like AD's injury would be largely the reason we would win), Denver would eat you for breakfast because Jokic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ayton.  Notice they are actually shooting well, unlike us.  You don't have anybody who can limit the MVP especially with AD gone, and they have actually been shooting well, unlike the Suns."
Yes the Lakers are ok with that.  Because Booker is shooting 40%. I would mention Paul's numbers but he was injured. If Ayton gets open dunks its not a concern at all. If Booker goes off. It is.  You guys have only won games Booker has done well in. Aytons performance means nothing to ur teams success.   And I find it funny that you brought up that he shot 80%.  Insinuating that Ayton creates his own shot. It would be like bringing up that DeAndre Jordan shoots 70%.
Deandre Ayton is the next all time great big because he’s played well in the first round
"I'm saying the same thing about Deandre Ayton, then.   But we will NOT let the Kings say this about Bagley."
"One thing all Suns fans agree on - ""soft hands"" and DeAndre Ayton do not go in the same sentence. He has bricks for hands. It is the one thing that consistently infuriates us."
I just saw a stat line  that goes in the last 35 years the only players with 75+ points  and 50+ rebounds through there first four playoff games are   SHAQ  Patrick Ewing  David Robinson  And deandre Ayton pretty good company to me 🤷‍♂️

"DeAndre Ayton. He’s flexing his guns rn, showing why he’s actually a legit future star."
DeAndre Ayton looks at least 45 years old
"I don't, it's more like if I say 20 &amp; 10 for CP3 you can assume it means something different than 20/10 if we're talking about DeAndre Ayton."
It's funny cuz lebron literally shoves deandre ayton while he's going up for the rebound right before this play
"Some observations:  Chris Paul looks like he's largely recovered from that shoulder injury. Had his best game of the series thus far - 18 points and 9 assists on 0 turnovers.  Deandre Ayton had another solid game - 14 points on 6-8 shooting, 17 rebounds and 2 steals - 0 turnovers as well.  The Lakers' fate is very much measured by Anthony Davis in this series. He plays badly in Game 1, they lose. He plays great in Games 2 and 3, they win. He plays gimpy in Game 4, they lose.  Now, for the elephant in the room - LeBron James. He's been solidly consistent, and his impact numbers bear it out, but he still hasn't had a transcendent, series defining performance. Will Game 5 be it?"
"Maddening.    LeBron and AD need a third superstar to beat Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul?"
"I feel like everyone kinda likes and roots for DeAndre Ayton though  Trae got way too much hate, ppl were being delusional saying he was straight up BAD on offense... his playstyle at the beginning of this season was annoying af and even Hawks fans were asking for him to shoot more 3s and stop hunting for contact, but the dude is an offensive dynamo and shoulda been an All Star"
"Man, DeAndre Ayton is a beast."
I love Deandre Ayton
Cameron Payne worries you more than Deandre Ayton?? Lmao
"Lol what does that even mean? People have said “fuck pat bev” everywhere he’s come up for like 6 years. Pat bev got a reputation technical that game for Ayton setting a moving screen. [actual professionals refer to bev and book butting heads as a headbutt from Beverley ](https://www.theringer.com/2021/6/23/22546811/suns-clippers-nba-playoffs-deandre-ayton).   And hell we own a lot of cp3’s flops too. He flops, everyone who’s watched him before should know that, However you want us as fans to own his behavior, y’all have to acknowledge that you sent guys out to intentionally try and injure our second best player(because our first best was already out and you still couldn’t beat us). It’s like y’all aren’t as good a team and y’all know it."
Top 10 Active Players Remaining:  1) Giannis  2) Paul George  3) Devin Booker  4) Trae Young  5) DeAndre Ayton  6) Khris Middleton  7) Jrue Holiday  8) Chris Paul  9) Reggie Jackson  10) John Collins
In case you’re wondering who the players are:  Player 1 is &gt;!Deandre Ayton in 2021!&lt;  Player 2 is &gt;!Chris Bosh in 2012!&lt;
Deandre Ayton
"What makes it worse is that there has already been US teams that have consisted of all black players. Jalen also said that Deandre Ayton should be on Team USA (even though he’s from the Bahamas). Jalen is a corny, race baiting, clown and I wish espn would get rid of him and his duckface wife."
"It's wrong and stupid because he said DeAndre Ayton should be the replacement. Ayton is from the Bahamas, which is a separate country from the US."
"DeAndre in 2015 played 482 (playoffs high) minutes and attempted 81 FG, Ayton has played 536 minutes and attempted 160. He is averaging almost double the FG per game than what DeAndre was getting on peak lob city."
"If PG shot a man, CP3 could have been in a different city and he still would have fallen on the floor. Guy was on the floor more than he was walking around last night. Deandre Ayton also got no calls going against him. Crowder should have been hit with about 4 techs, instead he was hit with zero"
"Deandre Ayton did have a good first two years but you look at him now compared to his rookie season and his defense is much improved, his shot selection is better, he's really starting to find the ways he can be most effective helping his team at the NBA level.   While I will agree he had a better rookie season than Wiseman but Wiseman got screwed out of a college season, Ayton got a full college season at Arizona which definitely helped his game, he entered the league before COVID got the full summer camp experience, full training camp, didn't catch COVID (Wiseman caught it right before the season started though didn't have a bad case apparently).   All of that stuff matters for a 19 year old big man. Bigs take the most time to develop. But I saw Wiseman improve, sometimes literally from one game to the next. Wiseman has shown a lot of great flashes his rookie year, a few plays taking the ball from the back court to finish in transition with his long strides, straight line quickness and length, we've seen he's got the foundations of a real 3pt shot, and his physical tools are elite. Once he gets the timing and spacing down he's going to be a premier rim defender.   I know overall opinion is down on Wiseman, I know the guards like Ant and LaMelo played pretty well this season, but I still believe Wiseman is going to be great."
"Bam is my guy overall but Ayton is a better lob target and generally more forceful around the basket.  Bam is much more quick with his feet and head but deandre is a better leaper with a wider catch radius, that #1 pick toolbox."
"…mate.   Are you even watching the same replay? Watch the tall man move his leg to the right, interrupting the defender, thereby shoving said defender into the shooter. It’s literally all right there. Like actually in the video. With video evidence. Of DeAndre Ayton performing an illegal screen. On video. Because it’s basketball. It’s on video.   You’re so blinded by your hatred of a man you don’t know you are actively deluding yourself."
"It depends on context.   If you work at a factory, and the employees on the floor aren't allowed to use cocaine or heroin, and the management tests them for them, shouldn't EVERYBODY in the SAME COMPANY have to follow the SAME rules?   YES!!  If it is unacceptable for a player to use recreational drugs, then it is unacceptable for ANYBODY in the organization to use recreational drugs.   &amp;#x200B;  Performance enhancing drugs are a different story. In fact, the leagues are REDICULOUSLY strict rules about PEDs. Steroid? When I had plantar fasciitis, a dose of steroids cleared that shit right up, and any number of small injuries can be addressed in the same way. But NBA players aren't allowed such treatments. Over-the-counter supplements that are perfectly legal?  John Collins and Deandre Ayton got suspensions for using that stuff.   So for PEDs, no... those are unique to performance on the court, so owners and other employees shouldn't be held to the same standard.  &amp;#x200B;  But yes. If an owner says ""no cocaine"" then the owner doesn't get to snort a line in front of the player while taking a blood sample. That's just common sense."

"You nailed it OP. For over ten years now, the best center on every roster with just a few rare exceptions is the PF. Skill and speed demolishes size in the NBA.  We used to believe the opposite on defense, but even on defense agility and contesting shots is far more important than being a rim protector and a post defender.  On offense, it's not even close.  We have over 15 years of statistical and logical evidence now, but sports are inherently conservative and dominated by men. 30 years later, hardly any NFL coaches understand the analytics that Bill Bellicheck brought to the New York Giants before he was even a head coach. In 15 years, you will still be beating your head against the wlal, knowing that 95% of fans don't truly get how important small ball is. Even this topic with posters who were saying last night that LAC had so chance without Zubac are now saying ""small ball is great, but.""  There is no but. If Jokic, Embiid, or Ayton can carry an offense and beat your offense 4 out of 7 games, you had no chance at the championship anyways. It's a perimeter game. And those are the best centers, most centers in the league are a complete waste of time other than a body to get you through the regular season.  It's mind blowing that Zubac went from 8th or 9th in the rotation (Leonard played more minutes than him even in the series he got injured) during two series wins to starting in the WCF just to match up with Deandre Ayton, a dunk finisher and overrated player. It's frustrating knowing that almost nobody on here can actually learn even though I've been posting the same things for about 8 years. Congrats to you, way to question the boomer myths about basketball that came from knowledge decades ago."
How does deandre Ayton only put up 10 vs no center
Agreed. https://lmgtfy.app/?q=deandre+ayton
"I haven't watched enough Ayton but... is he like totally incapable of being trusted with an entry pass in the low post? I don't recall seeing a single attempt at one. Suns are treating him like he's Deandre Jordan, only allowed to have lobs and putbacks."
"Deandre ""Rudy Gobert"" Ayton"

"Deandre ""Chinanu Onuaku"" Ayton"
Deandre ayton looks like a fucking make a wish kid out there goddamn
DeAndre Ayton is Greg Oden's grandson
"I know zubac isn’t very good, but not having him is bad in terms of the clippers ability to defend lobs and pick and rolls with deandre. I’d be shocked if the suns don’t spam pnrs with cp3 and booker and Ayton. If that’s going well, and the roll players actually make a couple threes, this could get ugly for the clippers if they don’t shoot the ball better"
Deandre “Steph “Damian “Trae “Rick Barry” Young” Lillard” Curry” Ayton
I wonder what gotten into Deandre Ayton I remember when people used to call him soft &amp; a waste of a 1st draft pick. Things have definitely turned around for him in these playoffs.
Also non US citizen Deandre Ayton
Deandre ayton is going to shit all over giannis
Peak Steven Adams&gt;Gobert is just flat out blasphemy and Cousins is being underrated on this...no Deandre Ayton isn’t close to better than pre-Achilles Boodie
[Heres an article showing he does](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.azdesertswarm.com/platform/amp/basketball/2017/9/25/16364876/arizona-wildcats-deandre-ayton-vertical-measurements-recruiting-2017-roster-depth-chart-nba-draft)  [Heres a video showcasing it](https://youtu.be/OeBhoVeFhT4)  Look at where his head is in that video.
"Deandre Ayton has a 43.5” vertical leap, but uses it sparingly."
He wants to see that Dillon Brooks-Deandre Ayton P&amp;R
"Jalen also said Ayton, should take Love’s spot. Deandre Ayton, born in the Bahamas. 🤡🤡"
"And Michael wouldn't be in the goat conversations without Pippen. That's a fact. Pippen took on the responsibility to get rebounds, get teammates involved, score, and defend the best player. Jordan could do some of that, not at Pippen's level but he was such a gifted scorer and had the flashy plays so he got all the attention.  For example, take a look at Suns vs Clippers game 4. Booker played poorly, shot 8/22, but still scored 25 pts, 2 Reb,  2 STL, 0 AST, and 5 TO. DeAndre Ayton shot 8/14, scored 19 pts, 22 reb, 3 AST, 4 blk, 1 STL. But all headlines said Devin Booker's 25pts lead Suns past Clippers. That's a garbage headline. Ayton was the most valuable but mainstream media didn't give him that credit.  Imagine that happening during your whole career!"
There have been so many jaw dropping moments this playoffs already. Try to enjoy the show being displayed by upcoming stars. Tell me the Deandre Ayton alley-oop closer wasn't entertaining.
"Obviously he’d be at the very bottom of this list probably, but how long before we put Deandre Ayton on these lists. Man has just as much potential"
He’s no Deandre Ayton for sure because he’s not the third best player on his own team
&gt; he is no ~~trae young~~ K'von Huerter or ~~deandre ayton~~ Mikal Bridges. winning means something. empty stats guy this one
"Yup. There was a lot of debate on Ayton vs. Luka in /r/suns back in 2018 before the draft. I personally wanted Luka, and like you said I wanted to offer Capela the max to fill in the 5 position (defensive minded center who can rebound and serve in the PnR) To me, Ayton filled a similar role as Capela but at the cost of Luka.  Thankfully, the Suns built around Ayton about as perfectly as you could with Monty and CP3 (shoutout to Rubio who was an underrated signing IMO too, but unknown how much he helped Ayton's development) and his biggest weaknesses from when he was drafted (defense/motor) are actually strengths of his now. Was funny to hear Mikal basically confirm on Duncan's podcast how Deandre had a shit work ethic early on until this year, and how he has really elevated his game because of it.   Anyways, all of this is hindsight, and honestly if we win a ring this year we can all sleep easy regardless. Also gotta remember that if we did take Luka, Igor probably doesn't get fired and we don't hire Monty. There are too many what ifs to even compare. I'm just happy we didn't take Bagley lmao"
he is no trae young or deandre ayton. winning means something. empty stats guy this one.
"As a Suns fan, I'm obviously happy we won, but outside of Deandre Ayton, nothing about last night's game was enjoyable."
"in a bucks vs. suns finals. the most importnat player gonna be DeAndre Ayton again. If Pat bev/PG can give Book/Cp3 fits, Jrue and Middleton gonna give them hell too. Ayton will be huge"
"I genuinely cannot believe I have to explain stuff that happened ~3 years ago on this sub, but if you really want me to spell out the complexities of this 'ancient history' then fine.  Here's your statement:  &gt; most mock draft boards were saying ayton/bagley, and moved to ayton as we got closer. The buzz on luka was there, but most boards had him somewhere in the top five.  This timeline is blatantly off. There was never an ""Ayton vs. Bagley"" debate, there probably wasn't even a moment in time before June 2018 where the plurality top two prospects on mocks was Ayton/Bagley in either order, and certainly no point where it was true for big boards. Bagley had a little bit of hype - not number one hype, but still top 2-3 hype - around ~Summer/Fall 2017 (but if you want to try to play it off that that is what you're talking about you're still wrong because MPJ was generally seen as a stronger NBA prospect at that point in time as well), but effectively dropped out of contention for the top spot on big boards entirely by the new year.  But wait you say, you have compelling evidence of 5 different links that support your claim? Surely these draft experts' opinions should be the authoritative voice on the subject, no? And yeah you're right, so let's see who these guys said was the best prospect in the class, let's start by looking at the writers who contributed to the first mock draft you posted, with the aforementioned Ayton, Bagley, Doncic 1/2/3:  KOC: Doncic  Chau: Doncic  Tjarks: Doncic  Huh??? None of them have Ayton number 1 on their big board? What??? But he was the consensus number one pick as you have so clearly laid out. And not a single one of these writers have Bagley above 5 on their boards? How could this be?  Well most of these mocks were posted in mid-June 2018, *after* the Suns and Kings did all but say who they were going to take. These top two's aren't reflecting people's opinions, it's reflecting the fact that everyone pretty much knew who was going 1-2, regardless of their own opinions.  So now let's get back to the original comment I corrected:   &gt; I mean, ayton was the consensus top pick that year, so he was regarded the best player available.  So yeah, this isn't true. You yourself have just provided testimony of three pretty well regarded writers saying no, DeAndre Ayton is not the best prospect in the draft. The most prominent Ayton supporters in the draft media, Schmitz and Givony, even went back and forth between Ayton and Doncic a bit in the year leading up to the draft.  I don't feel the need to discuss this any further because, to be blunt, this did not happen very long ago and if you disagree with the general statements I made in this comment that honestly says more about you."
DEANDRE JEFFREY AYTON WOULD NEVER
Deandre Ayton: Yes
Deandre “Greg Oden” Ayton
"Those picks can be anything, though. Sky's the limit. They can even end up being a DeAndre Ayton!"
I don't have a single bone to pick with you. Ayton might never be 90% of The Admiral's peak. But Robinson has been his player comparison right from his Arizona days. That's the only reason I brought his name up.

Deandre Ayton loves CP
DeAndre Ayton can become a player like Hakeem if he continues to master his craft. He could be even more successful if the Suns can get a ring this year. That guy is special.
Deandre Ayton for averaging 22/13 on 75 TS%
"Yet indeed. 2025 league MVP, Terror of the Post, Destroyer of Mismatch, DeAndre ""Bank shot"" Ayton."
"As a Mavs fan, I'm seeing it as Trae Young vs DeAndre Ayton.  sigh"
"How are the Suns underdogs to the Kawhi-less Clippers and Nuggets? They have by far most talented team compared to the comp they faced. They're facing PG13 with Reggie Jackson as their best player and Zubac facing Deandre Ayton, lol."
Deandre Ayton has played every game
"DeAndre Jordan made 1st team all NBA by being able to excute the ""oop."" Ayton is a better overall player than Jordan, so he could do the same."
"Deandre Ayton is worth a contract larger than almost anyone else discussed in these ""Is so and so worth a max"" threads."
"&gt;Rudy Gobert looked lost against the Clippers like he shouldn’t be on the floor defensively. Ayton is dominating them.  Lmao. I love when two circlejerks collide like this. On one hand, you have the ""Rudy Gobert should've been benched"" take, and, on the other, you have the current ""DeAndre ayton is basically a god"" attitude that's picking up steam due to his recent play. The best part is when you realize that this comment, at its core, is arguing that a **3x DPOY** (and reigning DPOY at that) is worse defensively than a 3rd year player who hasn't even made an all nba defensive team yet. I get that the playoffs turn everyone into prisoners of the moment, so it's understandable in a way, but I still find it funny in extreme cases like this.   Also, like the other guy mentioned, this comment doesn't even take kawhi's absence into consideration"
Yep. Deandre Ayton could be a Tim Duncan who smiles more. Pay the dude.
"Andre Drummond is not DeAndre Ayton hahaha. The only people who talked themselves into Drummomd being anything more than a rebounder were Lakers fans, and that optimism lasted about 3 games.  When the pistons gave him that fat contract I think 2/3 of the league cringed. Pistons talked themselves into ""well I guess we gotta pay him""."
I really really like deandre ayton.
DeAndre Ayton loves cp 🤣
"Deandre Ayton quoted after the game ""I love CP, man."""
"&gt;Deandre is an anchor on defense which doesn’t always show up in stats. Not even contested shots would show up. KAT is obviously better from a skillset standpoint on offense by a large margin but what Ayton provides to his team on defense is astronomical to their success.   And you don't think the Wolves would have been a top seed if you gave KAT Jae Crowder,Booker,CP3 and Mikal Bridges?"
Deandre is an anchor on defense which doesn’t always show up in stats. Not even contested shots would show up. KAT is obviously better from a skillset standpoint on offense by a large margin but what Ayton provides to his team on defense is astronomical to their success.
"If you think ayton is at this point any better then any of those 4 just because he has good shooting percentages, which is a function of him being a non primary scoring option, and a decent defense vs back up centers, then you really don't understand much about basketball.   You know who had the highest true shooting in the regular season? Deandre Jordan. Is it because he is the best center in the NBA? No, it is because he does not need to create and shoots only when he needs to do minimal work. If ayton develop an outside shot and playmaking abilities, which he won't and shouldn't given his attributes, then he would be the best c in the league. Still a great player tho!"
Deandre Ayton is who I wish Anthony Day to Davis was
Saying it for the people in the back “Deandre Ayton is the best center in the NBA” been saying this and people need to realize he isn’t going anywhere and is only going to get better.
"The suns can pretty much rely on one of Chris Paul, Devin Booker or Deandre Ayton to deliver in any given game."
"Yeah, Deandre Ayton and Zubac get a pass. It’s like they were the only two guys playing competent basketball from start to finish. Pretty amazing how bad everyone else was."

DeAndre Ayton
"You’re using TS% completely wrong lmao. Volume matters. Do you know what volume means? Zubac scoring 6 ppg on 60+ TS% doesn’t mean he’s in anyway a more effective scorer. By your logic Deandre Ayton is a more effective scorer than Devin Booker. I just don’t think you understand the concept of volume + efficiency, like at all.   The reality is 26.6 ppg on 57.4 TS% are star numbers. He’s more than shown up.  &gt;PG has lost 7 of the past 10 series he’s played in  No, PG’s *team* has lost those series. You do understand that basketball is…a team sport? And not played 1 on 1?   The reality is PG has played well even in the losses. The only real let down was the first Jazz series."
"As a suns fan, it is CRAZY to read this about DeAndre ayton. Like absolutely nuts. If he had one issue, it's mental focus.  I think he has unlocked something in himself this last month+ that may change the direction of his career"

Man Deandre Ayton is the only guy that can come out of this game feeling good. Everyone else was basically bricking. It's like DA is a 3x champ and 2x DPOY and everyone else on both teams are just rookies playing in their first playoff run.
"The Suns annoyed me so much the past 3 games.  But they never got these scrappy bullshit finishes to go their way.   This is the year.  Shout out to Deandre ""Bahamian God"" Ayton. And for Booker who even though was horrible, when the offense couldn't do anything hit a pull up and 6 FT's to keep us afloat. And Mikal for doing that but on D.

"For real. Credit to the Bucks, but Chris Paul had only 19 points and Devin Booker had 10 and played less than 30 minutes. Deandre Ayton was ties for the second-leading scorer with 18.  Acting like we saw the full force of the Suns tonight is nuts. The lineups were terrible, Booker was awful, and Chris Paul was also not himself. Additionally, at one point we had Paul, Booker, and Ayton all on the bench at the same time, which is just an insane decision by Monte."
"DeAndre Ayton is, what, 22? 23? And he looks like one of the old-timers at the barbershop"
"Imagine having Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton on your team, and deciding to sit all 3 of them at the same time in a Finals game."
Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton would be up 3-0 if they didn’t have to drag Chris Penis along

DeAndre Ayton might just fuck around and win finals MVP
### DeAndre Ayton Finals MVP 2021. Let’s fucking goooo
"DeAndre ""Kobe 'Bean' Bryant"" Ayton"
Scoring ayton of points is DeAndre
You can’t tell me with a straight face that Deandre Ayton isn’t the type of gentleman you want your daughter to marry.
"Devin “merchant” Booker hard selling in the first quarter, selling that fmvp to Mr. Deandre Ayton."
Notorious sharpshooter Deandre Ayton
DeAndre Ayton is the oldest looking 22 year old i have ever seen.
Deandre Ayton 3 fouls before the 2nd quarter guaranteed
Givony and Vecenie are 2 of the biggest draft experts and they both had Ayton first pre Draft Lottery  https://theathletic.com/237505/2018/02/12/2018-nba-mock-draft-is-deandre-ayton-the-best-player-to-build-around/  https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/22726756/2018-nba-mock-draft-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-trae-young-more    It was definitely a debate but I think the majority saw Ayton as #1 even before the Suns got the #1 pick
How on earth deAndre Ayton isn’t in the hall of fame yet .
"A layup usually refers to when you have beaten your man to the rim, not throwing up a high shot off the top of the glass over the outstretched hand of Deandre Ayton."
Exactly how I feel about CP3 and Ayton. Cp3 flops a lot and I hate it but he’s the best Clipper ever. And Ayton is what deandre Jordan wishes he was.
Deandre Ayton or Wilt Chamberlain?
"Definitely call Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges to the Olympic team right now - they shouldn't have to worry about the Finals, their country needs them."
"Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton"
"Actually that whole 2018 draft class is insane. All of them are so young and so good. Deandre Ayton, Trae, Luka, Mikal Bridges, Michael Porter Jr. ..."
"we’ll take one monty williams, devin booker, and deandre ayton"
"Deandre Ayton dropped 42 points?   I said close, not better. Keep moving those goal posts."
People should be scared that Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges are both good answers for this.
DEaNDRE Ayton
DEandre Ayton
DeanDre Ayton
"Not to be too pedantic, but it’s “Deandre Ayton,” no capital A"
"Team chemistry matters. That's why joining bunch of superstars doesn't always work. Plus, the Suns have other good players like DeAndre Ayton"
"“calling Steph Curry a shooter is pure disrespect, he can shoot but many of these guys are just shooters.”   What do you want them to say? “All of the players are rim runners however with the caveat that DeAndre Ayton has a more diverse skill set.” Don’t be so sensitive about ur team lol."
I doubt it. So much of what makes CP3 great is what he did with Lob City. Ayton wouldn't be this good with those Blake and DeAndre Jordan Backdoor cuts off ball.
&gt;I feel like Mobley has the higher bust potential than Green but a higher ceiling.  I feel the opposite. I feel like Deandre Ayton right now is basically Mobley's floor. Green's floor is being an inconsistent scorer with poor enough defense to get relegated to the bench.   &gt;he’s essentially just Nerlens Noel  He's already a better defender than Noel.
He slims down and watches Deandre Ayton tape for 10 hours a day
I like how they call Giannis at the 5 a small lineup. Aint nothing small about that dude. He's the same size as Deandre Ayton lol

"Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton were already providing enough fantastic play for the Phoenix Suns. So when they’re getting 27-point efforts from other players? That makes them pretty unstoppable."
Deandre Ayton
"Giannis was scaring the shit out of me in the first quarter, the dude was playing absolutely amazing, and of course even tho I’m a suns fan I gotta give jrue holiday some props for getting up there and blocking deandre ayton like that"
DeAndre Ayton is my fucking guy! Chris Paul and Devin Booker are just on another level but watching DeAndre Ayton play just ties the room together. I absolutely love it.
"I hope I never see another post ragging on Deandre Ayton for not living up the to the number one overall pick hype.  That man, has been the ULTIMATE 3rd year player.   Mans seriously just had his worst game of the playoffs yet, and STILL put up:  10 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, 2 blocks, 0 turnovers whilst being the best defensive player on his team.  In a win by 10 points in the NBA finals.  Ps. Mikal Bridges."
"Everyone after the 2018 draft: Look at Luka Doncic and Trae Young, man.   Mikal Bridges &amp; Deandre Ayton: Our time has come"
deandre ayton has been so useless this game smh
Deandre Ayton playing like Jar Jar Binks or some shit he look lost
Deandre Ayton might regress to Deandre Aypound
As soon as Chris Paul leaves Ayton is DeAndre Jordan
bro deandre ayton has been going up soft smh
"About the best chance to stop the death of the big man I'd bet on guys like Bam Adebayo and DeAndre Ayton. Fast, athletic centers. Ayton is the reason why the Suns are going to obliterate the Bucks."
How you got gonna confuse Jrue Holliday and Deandre Ayton?
"New to NBA, the DeAndre Ayton guy def something special, waiting for another good game by him"
"I hate that the names match up, but DeAndre Ayton reminds me of LAC DeAndre Jordan with his smooth, athletic movements, however he is not a liability from the free throw line and has a more rounded offensive game from the post/mid-range. Excited to see how he continues to progress throughout the years and if he can add a consistent 3 ball. If so, we might have another Embiid 🤧"
"I said arguably. You gave a reason (advanced stats) as to why he could be considered their best player.   Just as easily, someone else could say Devin Booker is the best player because he's the most versatile scorer, or someone else could say DeAndre Ayton is the bets player because of his defense, rebounding and efficiency.   Arguable means it's up for debate. Paul is not unanimously his team's best player ala '90s MJ, 00's Dirk or Iverson, 10's LeBron. Paul's great but he's very much part of a three headed monster."
the Andre in Deandre isn't actually capitalized so you wanna say Debust Ayton instead
The two best from each team.  The hawks second guy is lacking.  That's why I add what DeAndre needs to become to be better than Book and Ayton.
I’m not disagreeing but big guys learning to properly defend the paint and switching and all the different coverages is prob the hardest role imo. It’s why I’m super impressed by Deandre Ayton.   But I suppose you can get by with decent positioning even if you’re not elite
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-
I'm not getting out of my way to watch Deandre Ayton
Fellow Mavs fan and lack of superstar/superstar talent?  - Book - CP3 - DeAndre Ayton  - Giannis - Jrue Holiday - Khris Middleton - Lopez  There’s a lot of names here that a casual fan could pick out man. It’s simple: a team from California isn’t in the finals therefore not worth broadcasting or promotion
"No it would be like The suns last year giving up Deandre Ayton and the #10 pick for James harden, not a great deal but You feel like you could build something with it"
Deandre Ayton within 5 feet. I’m not sure what you mean by second half. Is that who would I pick to defend DA from that range. That would of course also be Deandre Ayton.
Two way? Ayton is DeAndre Jordan on offense my guy
"If homeboy is coming through with no rebounds, it's quiet. Yeah, no, it's quiet for him. But if he comes through in, like, [these](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/4278129/deandre-ayton) — you got some 20-20 games out here, you got some blocks — homeboy is going to, like... get it."
"Yeah, to me how much credit lies in CP3 as the floor general. I think it’s too early to tell. I do think that Deandre Ayton will be better than DeAndre Jordan when it’s all said and done though."
"I would argue that giannis is quite skilled for his position at least.  he's obviously a subpar shooter, but he is good at dribbling and playmaking  to the point where he can be a major ball handler.  There are loads of athletic wings and big men that do not have as much skill as Giannis and therefore are worse (Javale Mcgee, John Collins, Bam,Deandre Ayton*,Gobert etc.)  I guess you could say compared to his superstar peers, he is unskilled, but in general he's pretty skilled.  *I know Ayton is on a run right now, but Giannis uses his dribbling (skills) to self create scoring, while Ayton needs a playmaker to help create his,because he is not skilled at dribbling."
1. Deandre Ayton 2. Ja Morant 3. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
"Ayton's a bust guys. Deandre Ayton has never had fewer than 3 fouls playing against the Milwaukee Bucks  Terrible.  But really, who the fuck cares he is a superstar.  No he is not but he is a good center and up and coming star"
"Ja Morant, Deandre Ayton, SGA. Purely based off how good the teams the play on are."
Deandre Ayton may regress to Deandre Halfton
Deandre ayton is the 3rd best center in the nba IMO
"Well that sucks, they should have looked for contact more or stop shitting their pants over Deandre Ayton contesting at the rim"
"Apparently the NBA only requires 20 FGM to qualify for the single playoff FG% leaderboard - so Daniel Gafford and his 84.6% (on 22 FGM) this year is going to shatter the official record, lol.  Bumping that up to 50 FGM gives you Gobert this year at #1 (74.1%) and DeAndre Jordan in 2015 at #2 (71.6%) ahead of Ayton.  Up it to 100 FGM and now Ayton is #1 *by far* - 71.1%, while #2 is only 62.2% (1985 James Worthy).  Since there was talk of guys like Shaq, let's add a 10 FGM per game qualifier to that as well. Probably not too surprising, the top 4 are Hakeem (61.5%), Shaq (61.2%), Kareem (60.7%), and Shaq again (60.6%) before it drops off to ~57% range. Shoutout to Kawhi this year at #6 (57.3%), the only one in the top 10 from the 2000's and on."
*Deandre Ayton has entered the chat*
"Nah you lost because your team was outplayed and didn't have an answer for the Suns' guards or Deandre Ayton, glhf in game 2 though"
DeAndre Ayton &gt; Deandre Jordan
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
Deandre Ayton is the future of the center position. He’s CP3’s pet project and it’s awesome to see him develop.
DeAndre Ayton &gt; DeAndre Jordan
i think the key player for each team is jrue holiday and deandre ayton. if one of them completely outplays the other i think their team will win the finals
Deandre Ayton-Jabbar   Aka  Deandre Aycinder
Something that's been bothering me; isn't the illegal defense rule supposed to kick in when a player is camped in the paint for more than 3 seconds and doesn't step out? What constitutes them 'guarding' someone when they sag off significantly and just camp the paint?  It felt a lot of times the Suns always had at least one person in the paint beyond an arms reach or so that stayed for far longer than 3 seconds. DeAndre Ayton especially.   Am I interpreting the rules incorrectly?
"I dunno, I've been crunching the numbers on this, and Chris Paul is only nine letters whereas Deandre Ayton is twelve.  Sources tell me that Ayton has the bigger name."
"The Bucks need to play better offensively since unless Jrue locks one of the two guards up himself it doesn't seem like they have a clear answer defensively (although the Lopez minutes went better than Bud's reaction to them, they still didn't go well). Giannis being in good shape and improving as the series goes on (HOPEFULLY) will help. Jrue will probably be better than Bledsoe half the series. But wasting the first great Middleton game must feel very bad. Next time he shoots like Dennis Schroeder will be a guaranteed loss so they need to take advantage of his superstar nights.  On the Suns side, shout out Deandre Ayton, shout out to Devin Booker being the best player on the court in the first half, shout out to the Point God, shout out to Monty Williams, the best pre-planning coach in the NBA.   Some team will be extremely glad they paid like, 90 million for 4 years of Cam Johnson and it will hurt me immensely in my soul.  Low hanging fruit from the Suns: don't get 1 three from Book and Crowder in double digit attempts.   My Suns in 5 prediction is looking good but it was really thinly veiled because before tip off I was terrified and hyperventilating. It's awesome to see the two best teams in the NBA square off, relatively healthy. DDV and Saric will both be major losses, and Giannis playing through his knee and Paul through his wrist are inspiring."
Ayton = DeAndre Jordan with better touch

"I'm waiting for the ""DeAndre ayton is the first to score 25 points with 75% fg 12 reb and 4 blocks in the second game of a final series since Michael Jordan, who also had like 9 steals that game or whatever"""
If Ayton didnt have CP3 he would be looked at as DeAndre Jordan 2.0 this playoffs
wow DeAndre Ayton really is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar after all
"The thread title is this: Is Deandre Ayton beginning to become slightly overrated?  And the answer is definitely Yes. Because people are getting too hung up on his FG%, while the FG is boosted a shit ton by his teammates. A high FG% doesn't necessarily mean a player is at a high level.  As I said, his play right now makes him a great 3rd option on a playoff team but he still hasn't shown if he can be a 1st or 2nd option on a team."
Deandre Ayton is a better player than Rudy Gobert and deserves a max a whole lot more than Gobert.
"All Deandre Ayton does is outplay the ""best"" bigs in the league in the playoffs.  We still mad about Alcindor. We gonna stay mad. The Bucks are getting punished. Suns in 4."
"it’s crazy how good deandre ayton is, he doesn’t need touches and he still produces"
"Deandre Ayton is easily having the best playoff debut run by any player in NBA history.      He is shooting at a ridiculous 70.6% FG and has a True Shooting percentage of 70.3, the most in NBA history."
"Deandre Ayton is easily having the best playoff debut run by any player in NBA history.      He is shooting at a ridiculous 70.6% FG and has a True Shooting percentage of 70.3, the most in NBA history."
"Ayton was much less efficient and much worse than Gobert last year.  Honestly, if this thread was made before the playoffs, there would be a lot more people would be saying Gobert than Ayton.  That being said, Ayton's definitely on the right track.  Gobert was playing in g-league games when he was Ayton's age.  Deandre is only gonna get better form here."
"Players with 20+ PTS, 15+ REB, 80+ FG% in a Finals game in the shot clock era (since 1955): Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Deandre Ayton  you are tripping.  not even hakeem did this."
"Players with 20+ PTS, 15+ REB, 80+ FG% in a Finals game in the shot clock era (since 1955): Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Deandre Ayton.  lol, actually he is helping to beat Giannis quite a bit since Giannis has never and will never do the above.  That is the definition of ""historically good""."
"1993: Chris Webber &lt; Isaiah Rider, Terry Dehere, Sam Cassell  2004: Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West   2010: John Wall &lt; Demarcus Cousins, Ed Davis, Damion James  2011: Kyrie Irving &lt; Jonas Valanciunus, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson  2018: Deandre Ayton &lt;&lt; Trae Young, Jerome Robinson, Anfernee Simons   I'm not sure at all about those"
"Remember that one year ESPN tried to get him not to announce picks beforehand, and he would do it all mysteriously like ""Phoenix suns are enlightened to see DeAndre Ayton is still on the boards."""
"That was not a great time for Center as far as talent goes. Gobert hadn't really come into his own, KAT, Embiid, Jokic were all still just starting out, Ayton, was still a teenager, Capela wasn't the player he is today.  It was a race between Boogie, Marc, Deandre Jordan and Brooks Lopez for who the best center in the league was, the talent pool around center just wasn't as deep."
"**Currently Better than Shai**  *Debatable*  ~~Shai is better~~   Draft Year| Name ---|--- 2011| **Kyrie Irving** 2012| **Anthony Davis** 2013| ~~Anthony Bennett~~ 2014| ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ 2015| **Karl-Anthony Towns** 2016| *Ben Simmons* 2017| ~~Markelle Fultz~~ 2018| *Deandre Ayton* 2019| **Zion Williamson** 2020| *Anthony Edwards*   u r wrong sir. Only 3 of the last 10 #1 are worst than Shai. Ayton, Edwards and Simmons can be debated, but Irving, Davis, KAT and Zion is better than Shai."
"nah bro he liked a funny tweet like 8 days ago, he must have a personal hatred for deandre ayton and his family"
"Are they NBA players who will play DeAndre Ayton next year?  Oh yeah, Harrell probably won’t play him either because he’s gonna be on the bench because Ayton and the Suns are gonna destroy him and pick him apart defensively 😭😭  I’m really enjoying pissing off the Harrell burner accounts"
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
"But their role players did step up. Cameron Payne and Cam Johnson played great, it’s a shame Cameron Payne didn’t get played more. Granted Jae crowder did go ice cold in some games, but pat connaughton was as well, so suns legitamelly had chances to put all 3 of those games to bed. DeAndre Ayton did have some poor games but he’s playing against a former all star and a back to back league mvp and a Greek demigod"
Ok do you want the generational PF/C who can still stretch the floor and be like Anthony Davis or do you want like… nothing?  You can draft Mobley or you can draft really badly and get someone who could potentially maybe someday guard two generational centers and Deandre Ayton??
"Ayton averaged over 18ppg in 2019/20 before CP3,   Capela and especially DeAndre Jordan were nothing before CP3"
Ayton has a jumpshot and can defend well on the perimeter.  DeAndre Jordan can’t shoot at all and gets destroyed on the perimeter.  Just say you haven’t watched Ayton play before making an idiotic post like this
"Nobody really thought this, Ayton was clearly going to be our pick from very early on. There was very little speculation that anybody other than Deandre was getting taken by Phoenix."
"&gt; Cunningham also has ""best player on a title team potential""  Last ten number one overall picks:  * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Deandre Ayton * Markelle Fultz * Ben Simmons * Karl-Anthony Towns * Andrew Wiggins * Anthony Bennett * Anthony Davis * Kyrie Irving  The only players on that list who have won a title are Kyrie and Davis, and that's because they played with LeBron James. Who in that group looks like they actually have ""best player on a title team"" potential? Davis, *maybe* Zion, and that's probably it. How many of those players were better than SGA in their third year? Towns, Davis, and Irving?"
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
Trae Young / LaMelo Ball / Tyrese Haliburton  Luka Doncic / Lu Dort / Desmond Bane  Michael Porter Jr / DeAndre Hunter / Duncan Robinson  Jaren Jackson Jr / John Collins / PJ Tucker  DeAndre Ayton / Xavier Tillman / Isaiah Stewart
"Both. They won't be the 2 seed imo and they won't make the finals obviously, baring Ayton becoming actually great and not just a really good DeAndre Jordan."
"He won MVP in the 2nd hardest league in the world as a teenager. There was definitely talk about him being generational, I don’t think that was ever spoken about Bagley. I saw Jay Bilas Compare Deandre Ayton to Wilt Chamberlain in that season he was at U of A"
Deandre Ayton played for Phoenix this year
"They need someone that’s a young, dynamic player that is regarded as one of the best young players in their position. Like a Deandre Ayton! Half joking, but the Suns with their current trio + some more dependable role players should be enough. They can’t really trade for anyone that would compliment Bookers game due to assets and cap space, but maybe I’m wrong about that."
"That's true, but you have a whole lot of jackasses over there absolutely convinced that he's going to magically turn into DeAndre Ayton despite there being no indications of that so far."
"Hes alright, but I dont think he'll be able to do this in the NBA against real competition????. DeAndre Ayton and Marvin Bagley are more proven against elite college talent !!!"
Honestly  maybe you should just write a book of speculative NBA fiction. Make up off court drama too. Shit would be fun. I just can't believe that DeAndre Ayton slept Malik Monk's wife...that was out of pocket imo
"Jarret Allen, Bradley Beal, Middleton, Durant, LaVine, Seth Curry, Kevin Huerter, DeJounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young.   I would be running a ton."
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De’Aron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
**Bahamas Starting 5**:  C-Deandre Ayton  PF- Kai Jones  SF-Mychel Thompson  SG-Klay Thompson  PG-Buddy Hield   Would this lineup win a medal?
Deandre ayton and KAT maybe?
DeAndre Ayton Jr
"Come on man it’s basketball not geopolitical issues or solving hunger in Africa. We know who can hoop and who can’t. We have all the stats available to us now, we have unlimited film on the internet, there are hundreds of YouTube channels that do great breakdowns on the game of basketball if you’re really interested in the X’s and O’s. I don’t need some vanilla analyst to tell me that Khris Middleton is good at basketball and very underrated, or that DeAndre Ayton has been very solid in these playoffs."
"I guess every center is DeAndre Ayton then!!!   Such a tired argument, like how everyone compares any mediocre young qb to Josh Allen as a reason why they're actually really good.   Even at that, aytons numbers were much better than Wiseman's. Factoring in the defensive contributions you get from DA and it was never really close."
Drummond has a serious case of old-man-face.  We'll be saying the same thing about DeAndre Ayton in a few years
"I mean, their games were based on athleticism more than anything and they’re both old or injured now. It’s unfair to compare Blake or Deandre now to the Blake or Deandre of 8 years ago.   But we’re straying from my point. The argument was “if Chris Paul played with Kawhi he’d have a ring” and the answer to that can’t really be more than “ehh maybe”   He didn’t win with Blake, Deandre, JJ. He didn’t win with Harden. He didn’t win with Booker, Ayton, very good role players."
A rich mans Deandre Ayton
"Raised: Terance Mann, Trae Young, Deandre Ayton, (bonus: Cam Johnson)  Dropped: Ben Simmons, Julius Randle, Kristaps Porzingis"
Wow you’re just gonna leave out Deandre Ayton? Smfh.
You're missing baby face center Deandre Ayton.
"Disagree.  A two guard that’s exceptional at making tough shots and mediocre at defense? Where have seen that before? Sounds pretty close to Middleton.  Not saying that there’s another Giannis, but Embiid is pretty close to having that same two way dominant effect.   Pair a shot making guard like CJ with elite defensive personnel like the Sixers do, and he would for sure be good enough.  For reference, the number #2 players on the four conference finals teams this year were Reggie fucking Jackson, DeAndre Ayton, John fucking Collins, and Khris Middleton.  Only one of those dudes has ever made an all star game and they have zero all-nba team selections between them."
"Warriors fans need to realize that the most likely outcome for all of the guys they'd be trading out is that they are below average NBA players. Wiseman still has upside, but he's just a raw big man prospect at this point - just as likely to be Willie Cauley Stein as DeAndre Ayton. Wiggins has been a below average starter his entire career and was average during his best year last year. Looney, Poole, Paschall etc. are replacement level guys. These guys are primarily trade filler.  Beal is a 28 year old top 20 NBA player. Siakam is a 27 year old who was 2nd-team All-NBA 18 months ago. Wood is 25, already one of the best offensive big men in the league, and on one of the best contracts in the NBA.  If Warriors can get any one of them for their full package they should do it ASAP."
Might be unpopular but Ayton stock didn’t rise for me. It just exposed his lack of offensive game and we all know AD was eating Ayton’s lunch before his injury. Still young though so we’ll see if he adds anything or follows the DeAndre Jordan career path.
"You’re acting like our fan base thinks our young guys are superstars. It’s possible to be high on young guys and also have them not be quite ready to play winning basketball as a main option on a team. Those things aren’t mutually exclusive.   Curry missed 9 games and we went 1-8 during that stretch. Oubre was terrible all year. Jordan Poole looked like he belonged on the Shanghai Sharks the first half of the season. When curry got back, oubre was out, and Poole hit his stride we were actually a good team. That’s the sample size that fans are referring to, not the entire season as a whole because the first half of the year was a shit show.  As for Wiggins, nobody is saying he’s a superstar either it’s more that the narrative on him has changed because he’s become a legitimate lockdown defender. In minnesota he was always known for completely disappearing for games at a time. He’s turned it around and when he’s not clicking on offense he’s still contributing by locking up his guy.   And for wiseman, I haven’t seen any of our fans saying he’s legitimately good yet. But the ones who are fans of him see the flashes of things that very few other bigs can do and realize he’s super young and had some bad luck this year from covid to freak injuries. I’m not sure if he’ll be good, but saying he has the potential to be at least deandre ayton is not overrating him at all. He’s got the tools.   That said though, I think ayton is a poor player comp for him. Not that he can’t be as good or better than ayton, but his game is much more Chris bosh than deandre ayton."
"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it’s looking like he’s well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let’s see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I’d say it’s the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He’s averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he’s not super-efficient, his numbers don’t contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he’s fun and it’s good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren’t great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don’t hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year’s trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that’s it. He can’t pass the ball at a high level and he’s a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."
If the bucks don't trade for DeAndre Ayton first
"The Warriors need a center that fits what they do. They need someone who's gonna be big on the boards, is a good passer and is smart enough to fit in with their movement based system in terms of screening correctly and intelligently.  Steph-Klay-Wiggins-Draymond is plenty good enough 1 through 4, they need to stop pretending that 6'8 Kevon Looney is a starting center.  Find a guy who will hoover rebounds on both ends, play good D, help facilitate. Someone like Deandre Ayton would fit perfectly with what they need. Board man gets paid."
Dare I say yes? KD was more efficient but Giannis was the best player on BOTH ENDS.   Dude was blocking and contesting both Chris Paul and DeAndre Ayton. How many times has the FMVP been the best player offensive and defensively at the same time?
"If you’re not dependent on elite guard play and literally any guards in the NBA can feed you, then maybe, just maybe, you’re contributing something significant on offense????? Maybe there’s some kind of skill in there that is immediately translating to points for your team if it doesn’t matter whether you have Chris Paul or Raymond Felton to be effective???? Who knows though! Fucking lol.   To use worse offensive players to prove that your point is incredibly stupid. If it’s a stupid point for Tyson Chandler, then it’s a brain dead point for Deandre Ayton."
I’d say Ayton averaging as good efficiency as Deandre Jordan on nearly double the fga per game is a good thing??? Who knew that getting more high efficiency shots was a good thing?
AD averaged that on 67 TS% while being guarded by Bam and Jimmy Butler. Giannis feasted in on Deandre Ayton (amazing young player) and Corey Crowder
"I think people sometimes put too much weight on numbers and accomplishments than the context in which they occurred.  For example: Malone and Barkley lost to Jordan in the finals.  Everybody lost to Jordan in the finals.  If they had lost to the Knicks and Patrick Ewing, they'd have the same numbers (meaning: 0 rings) but they'd probably be less respected than they are now.  Now the story is: they got beaten by Jordan.  If it were the Knicks, the story would be ""they lost to Patrick Ewing"".  Barkley lost to Jordan. Well shit, who didn't?  Dirk beat Lebron, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Tough competition.  Giannis beat an old Chris Paul and a young Devin Booker and a young Deandre Ayton. I love the fact that Giannis won, but I'm not sure if 10 years from now we still think he went up against a really tough opponent.  Then again, Giannis might have a few more rings a few more years from now and that changes the story completely.  My point is: it's just too soon to be making all these statements about where Giannis stacks up historically.  He's not even done yet."
"He dropped 50 in a closeout game. That has only happened on other time including everything other ""ER"" finals that's ever happened. Once. Only once. You can't downplay something that two people have ever accomplished.  Who guarded curry in their finals appearances? Was he a better positional defender than deandre ayton? If not then why hasn't he dropped 50?"
Brandon Ingram---&gt; Kevin Durant  Andre Roberson--&gt; Ben Simmons  Kevin Huerter---&gt;Larry Bird  Jamal Murray---&gt; Michael Jordan  Greg Oden--&gt; Deandre Ayton (actually Oden may be Ayton from the future)
"Lol sorry chuck ran into peak MJ and Hakeem 6x while giannis ran into....injured nets, injured hawks and deandre ayton LOL"
"It’s CP3 hate, and much deserved. He played like hot garbage then placed the blame on the team in the postgame presser. Also, the way Ayton and Booker looked at the end of last night’s game reminded me of how Blake and DeAndre looked after all those Clippers playoff loses.   We also need to stop providing excuses for CP3, and trying to wedge him into the top 10 PGs of all time. The dude got his team to the Finals, but also showed them how to shift blame and not handle loses with professionalism or grace."
"Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson  Future is sunny"
"&gt;He didn’t have to win them all but he wasn’t even flirting with five hundred.  Suns ended up just short of .500 in 2020 and that was with DeAndre Ayton being suspended for almost half the season.  It's just a dumb standard.  Anyone with a brain can see that they were losing because they had an absolute dogshit roster, not because Devin Booker wasn't ""good enough"". Even LeBron in 2019 with a Lakers squad better than anything Book had in Phoenix didn't make the playoffs.    My point here though is you're blatantly changing the goalpost.  First it was that Booker didn't win. Fine. But then this year Booker is the best player on the 2nd seed in the West, gets his team to the NBA finals as a 1st option, and then proceeds to put up back to back 40 point games in the NBA finals, and was 28/5/4 in his first ever postseason.  Clearly Booker has won this year and he balled the fuck out.  Rather than acknowledging that, the narrative changes to he didn't win it *alone*.  It's a garbage take and completely unfair because plenty of other stars haven't done shit until they got a good team around them.  EDIT: It has nothing to do with me being a fan of his and everything to do with this being an absolutely stupid take.  I would rep this stance for any of the young stars who haven't won much yet."
Ayton is pretty underwhelming. Dude looked like DeAndre Jordan on offense and got pushed around by the Bucks all series.
"He definitely didn’t choke, but it also felt like he didn’t rise to meet the moment when the game was really in the balance.   With 7:21 left in the game, Paul hit 2 free throws to make it a 4-point game. It took nearly 7 minutes for Paul to attempt another shot (a missed 3 with 37 seconds remaining). He didn’t register an assist. He had one rebound.   He was outshot in that period by Devin Booker (understandable), Jae Crowder, and DeAndre Ayton (far less so). And it didn’t feel like he was orchestrating the offense either — he was far more mortal than his usual Point God moniker.   I don’t think he “choked,” especially since it does look like something’s physically wrong with him (that late turnover was just — not Chris Paul), but he definitely didn’t seize the moment like you would hope for a player of his caliber in a moment of this magnitude."
Deandre Ayton looks like he spent a few years on that beach in the M. Night Shyamalan movie
"Asking Robert Sarver to pay CP3 is going to opt out for extension. DeAndre Ayton and Mikal Bridges are eligible for rookie extension, and 2024 is UFA for Super Max contract."
"I honestly like Booker but his game has so much flaws it's not a joke. He still can't handle double teams very well without breaking down. The fella is a bit slow and unathletic when you compare him to great SGs like MJ, Kobe, and Wade. His lack in athleticism couldve been made up for exceptional 3 point skills like Klay, but he ain't at that level.   Overall, he's got a lot of work to do. It's good that he's still young n all but gotta look back at the greats. People go on about how he had 40 point games multiple times in the playoffs. I don't mean to sound like a broken record, getting 40 pts in today's game is nothing like it was back then. Defense was tighter and the slight tightness can make a whole lotta difference. Role players have shown to make 30 pts in a game. That was rare back then.  The player everybody should have their eyes on is DeAndre Ayton, Joker, and Giannis. We are going back to the era of the Goliaths. Luka will probably be the next bird but I feel like the bigs are taking back the game"
Poor Deandre Ayton - he just wasn’t ready for this. Guarding Giannis is a nightmare. As a bucks fan I felt for the dude he was getting all he could handle
"Ultimately the difference in this series was the difference in DeAndre Ayton in the western conference playoffs vs the nba finals for Phoenix. Part of it was Giannis was harder for him than jokic but really most of it was he just didn’t play well enough. Too slow reacting in the pick and roll or rotating, too many fumbled passes, couldn’t punish switches, missed too many bunnies. Part of the deal with relying on super young guys and what happens when you have to win without a real superstar at the highest level   It’s just very hard to do it when for 3 of the final 4 games one of your stars is legitimately quite bad in each game. Suns only got one game where Ayton CP3 and Booker all played well they needed 1 or 2 more to pull this off. And Giannis made sure there wasn’t enough room for error otherwise. Budenholzer also earned whatever extension he’ll get this was a strong series for him"
I feel bad for DeAndre ayton lol. He need to hit the weight room asap and find some bread and butter scoring moves. This man would catch the ball in the paint and look to see if he is open before he lay it in...like bro... just put the ball in the rim. You pump faking and spinning wide open lol. He def looked nervous.
"I understand what they said, and they are wrong. Why does everything have to be so negative here. Ayton Booker CP3 bridges Deandre all had a great run.  Can’t believe the guy giving a finals team props is in the minority opinion.   Never change guys"
"2 weeks ago chris paul was the 2nd greatest point guard ever   luka doncic was empty stats while devin booker was a championship closer   deandre ayton was top15 asset   and monty williams' ""top10 best inspirational scenes"" was the height of nba coaching    i remember   OH I REMEMBER   ARE WE OUT OF THE WOODS"
Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton - Combined 12/34  r/nba - Hur hur Chris Paul not clutch
"From what I've noticed, Ayton never complains for calls = Deandre Ayton fan  Also he has a soft touch for lobs at the rim"
"Devin Booker won the NBA cares award , Monty is a fucking saint whose wife died in an accident, Deandre Ayton is a big lovable goof. I know some of y'all have issues with the Suns but there isn't any reason to think they are ""bad people"", and if you look at this world and think outcomes are about your personal virtue then you are just fucking stupid. This guy is a joke."
"Last years Finals had two of the Heat's best players suffer relatively serious injuries (with one out for the series, and the other playing hobbled after missing some time), and their best player getting a minor injury, all in Game 1.  If Deandre Ayton and Devin Booker got hurt in this series, we'd never hear the end of how ""easy"" it was.  But everyone forgets that about last year because it's the Lakers and LeBron."
Deandre Ayton looks like he spent a few years on that beach in the M. Night Shyamalan movie
Those 2 plus Cam Johnson and Deandre Ayton all balled hard without resulting to pettiness. A small part of me still feels bad for Book but his flopping and whining has been pretty bad recently.
"This sucks. It sucks a lot. It felt like we had so much going for us as far as a sort of Cinderella story: The amazing character and story of Monty Williams, the great comeback of Cam Payne from washout China player to key role player, Book's whole career of slander as an ""empty stats guy"", CP3's whole career of being great and coming up short. It felt like destiny and it really sucks that we didn't get a storybook ending. I'm glad Monty is going to be the guy talking to our guys after this one because this one hurts for me as a fan and gotta be killer for our guys in that locker room.     However there's a lot of hope for us:   **Big rotation minute guys for us:**     Devin Booker: 24 Y/O   Mikal Bridges: 24 Y/O   Deandre Ayton: 22 Y/O   Cam Johnson: 25 Y/O   Cam Payne: 26 Y/O     **Consensus top 3 players of all time:**     MJ when he won his first title: 27 Y/O   LeBron when he won his first title: 27 Y/O   Kareem when he won his first title: 23 Y/O (didn't win another till he was 32)   I wanted to win this one bad. But this is the first time we've made the playoffs in over a decade and we were pretty damn close to winning it all. Even the greatest players ever took some time to win the dance.       **We were a laughingstock just a couple years ago:**     We had 6 coaches in a 5 year span until we got Monty.   I thought Josh Jackson was gonna be part of our big 3 just a few years ago.    We started Tyler Ulis for an entire year at point guard in 17-18.     We have a ton of talent, they're young, and they got some incredible playoff experience off one run that tons of guys don't get in 3 playoff trips.     Round 1 people were saying we weren't going anywhere because it wasn't our time yet. The best thing about that statement is that it acknowledges we have a ton of time left. I look forward to cheering our guys on next year."
Man deandre ayton is like at least two years away from being good enough to handle Giannis

Deandre Ayton out there doing Cardio
"When Nate Archibald injured his Achilles, he came back and was still really solid but not who he was. Nate coming through in the 2010s or 2020s ensures he’s not pushing the pace for like 40+ minutes a game (better injury prevention) and if he did suffer a catastrophic injury like he did, recovery training and technology is certainly better than it was 45 years ago.    David Thompson might have a career longer than ~8 years growing up under more exposure and discipline. Thompson in a 4-out or 5-out offense would’ve highlighted his greatest offensive attributes even more than they were in the days of four guys in the paint.    Shawn Marion probably gets way more attention and accolades now than he did 15 years ago. He would also be insanely sought-after by contenders and, despite his desire to be the #1 on offense, he was a great off-ball guy and could spot up a little. Probably makes a ton of money too.    Larry Nance Sr. gets a ton of hype and recognition as a two-way stud. Crazy athleticism, rim protection, developed a solid mid-range shot, and he was a really good pick and roll partner. Also makes big money today even though he might not have had the strength/physicality to play the 5 full time.    Robert Parish would be like the best version of Deandre Ayton. Runs the floor and protects the rim really well, great hands, hits mid-short jump shots consistently, and always manages to get 15-20 points a night even though he doesn’t get many plays called for him. Also making a lot of money in today’s league because his mobility and mentality are huge assets to have as a center."
"i mean people act like cp3's offense has been the problem, its been his defense, (shame since he was a really good defender in his prime, but, y'know, father time).     like for example his ortg is still 118, its his drtg thats gone to 124, (which btw, booker has been at 123 for drtg and 111 ortg the series).  even in the last two games, while he sucked in game 4, (73 ortg, yikes) his game 5 he had a 153 ortg, but had 139 drtg.  furthermore, in game 5, his vorp was a team high 5.9, with a 7.9 obpm, also, the dbpm gave him -2.0 dbpm, while booker had -3.0 and even deandre ayton (who is one of the better defenders on phoenix) had -1.9.  another issue the suns have, is you cant play winning basketball when your top player has +40% usg rate, which he had 43% in game 5 and game 4, they aren't playing balanced basketball.   my overall point being, rather than cp3 being a scapegoat, maybe the suns have a lot of different issues that re causing them to lose, these include:  \- defensive guard play, booker and cp3 have been terrible on the defensive end.  \- non diverse offense, booker has a way too high a usg rate, in milwaukee, their top 3 players have atleast 20% usg rate, going 30/27/22 for antetokounmpo, middleton and holiday, compared to 35/25/16 (you cant give mikal bridges the same amount of touches as deandre ayton.  tl:dr, cp3 not bad, booker need less ball, booker and cp3 cant defend anything and ayton needs more touches"
Giannis best defender this series is DeAndre Ayton lmao. Literally no one on the team to guard him.
"Here is an attempt at putting the article here. There are videos with surrounding text so I cut those and the surrounding text. Sorry if some of it doesn't make sense.  One trend that has perhaps been underdiscussed in these always-evolving NBA Finals: The Milwaukee Bucks are one win from the title in large part because their offense has been really, really good.  The Bucks in the Finals have poured in 117.7 points per 100 possessions, a mark that would have edged the Brooklyn Nets for No. 1 in the regular season. The ugliness of some of Milwaukee's meandering half-court possessions obscures how lethal this team can be when it gets rolling.  The easiest path to that is to not play in the half court at all, and a big theme in this series has been Milwaukee's ability to get out in transition. The Bucks aren't running quite as often as they did in the regular season -- when they played in transition more than any team, per Cleaning The Glass -- but they are still doing so at an above-average rate, and that's a win considering the Phoenix Suns were among the very best at keeping teams out of transition.  And the Bucks are scoring just about every time they hit the open floor: 152.9 points per 100 transition chances, according to Cleaning The Glass. The No. 1 team in the regular season by that measure finished at 133.8. Yowza. This is one of the subtler ways Phoenix's lack of size hurts. Deandre Ayton is the only guy in the Suns' rotation even resembling a big man, and he plays near the rim on offense -- meaning he is rarely back early as a deterrent. No other Sun can make Giannis Antetokounmpo at full throttle pause to think for one second.  The Suns have been a little lax with their floor balance and ball control, but the Bucks are opportunistic; they hunt transition chances with constant urgency.  Behind some hot shooting and smart adjustments from Mike Budenholzer in Game 5, Milwaukee's half-court offense -- its weak spot in past playoffs -- is up to about league-average production for the series, per Cleaning The Glass. The Bucks doing that against one of the league's nastiest half-court defenses is almost cause for a parade.  Milwaukee brutalizing Phoenix on the offensive glass has boosted that half-court scoring figure by turning some initially listless possessions into points. Milwaukee has needed all this offense, because the Suns have scored 115.5 points per 100 possessions -- a hair below their sixth-ranked figure in the regular season. Their effective field goal percentage for the series would have ranked No. 2 behind the Nets; it bumped even higher over Games 3, 4, and 5 -- all Phoenix losses. Phoenix is shooting the bejesus out of it.  The Suns have had to, because, as I noted before Game 5, the Bucks have methodically turned this series into a math problem the Suns can't win. The possession battle is a rout for the Bucks. They are getting more offensive boards and free throws. And their defense is scrunching the Suns' offense toward the midrange to a dangerous extreme. Phoenix is getting to the rim at a league-worst rate, and it has attempted just 30 corner 3s -- six per game, down from its regular-season average of 10. Seventeen of those 30 came in Game 2. In the four other games, the Bucks have basically erased the corners from the court.  It's great and not super shocking that Phoenix is shooting so well; the Suns consciously built around two elite shot-makers in Devin Booker and Chris Paul. It's not great that the Suns have to shoot well -- and almost preposterously well -- to have any chance to win. The Bucks have a margin for so-so shooting; the Suns don't.   Starting in Game 3, the Bucks have found the right mix of defenses to make the Suns uncomfortable. When Brook Lopez is on the floor, the Bucks play a slightly more aggressive version of their base pick-and-roll defense: Lopez ventures out to deter an easy jumper, but not so high as to approximate any sort of trap. He has mostly been able to stay in front of Booker and Paul, and then pivot back to Ayton in time to meet Ayton outside the block-charge circle -- forcing tough hooks and floaters.  The Suns might be able to find traction getting even more creative with where Ayton sets his picks -- sometimes close to midcourt; sometimes at the foul line. (Ayton is also smart about flipping the direction of his pick at the last second.) Booker might benefit from more instant head-down driving, and less pulling back to map the floor. Regardless: Lopez has hung in since the Bucks ditched Game 1's switch-heavy gambit.  When Lopez is off the floor, the Bucks switch everything. They don't seem all that concerned with handing Booker or Paul the Pat Connaughton matchup both are seeking. An adjustment in how Milwaukee's other four defenders react when the Suns get Connaughton on an island is one reason the Bucks have flipped the momentum in these Finals.  One Milwaukee tweak was to stop switching with Lopez. Connaughton at least has a shot of sticking close enough to Paul and Booker as to not require emergency help -- or at least not inspire the fear in his teammates that such help might be required.  It's easy to say Phoenix should spice things up instead of getting bogged down in isolation basketball: keep moving, set more ball screens, run split actions off the ball (when two teammates screen for each other and veer off in random directions), and continue with its sets as if facing a normal defense and not a switch-everything vise grip. The Suns should do all those things!  But elite switching defenses have a way of squeezing that verve out of you -- of making all that motion seem pointless and exhausting.  Milwaukee's offense has had euphoric ups and troubling swoons in the Budenholzer era, including in these playoffs, but its defense has been constant. If the Bucks have a mediocre scoring night after a sizzling first five games, that defense might be good enough to carry them across the finish line."
"rn its DeAndre Ayton, some fools think hes on the same level as guys like Bam, Vuc, or even KAT"
Markelle Fultz got a rookie extension and Deandre Ayton didn't. Mad world.
"It wasn't a correct pick at the time, it wasn't a correct pick six months out from the draft, it's not a correct pick today, it won't be a correct pick in five yeras time - there's literally no point in history at which it was a better idea to take Deandre Ayton over Luka Doncic"
I understand that. But just out of curiosity who's gonna give Deandre Ayton a max offer sheet?
"Yeah I don't understand those saying he's not worth the max.  We offered Nerlens Noel a 4-year $70M deal based on the *hope* that the 11.1PPG/8RPG season he had would become 14PPG/10RPG consistently, at least.  Deandre Ayton have much better numbers for more seasons, even after having ""sacrificed his stats"", so he's already worth the max."
deandre ayton will not request a trade 😂
Does anyone else think it’s strange that Kyler Murray and Deandre Ayton look so eerily similar in the face but like &gt;1’ height difference.   They could literally be in a remake of Twins and it’d be believable.
I'm all for players getting paid but I haven't followed the Sun's and not trying to hate. Just genuinely curious if anyone can help me out:  Why is DeAndre Ayton worth max money?
"I’d agree with you if the NBA was only based on scoring, but there’s more to the game than that. What DA does is invaluable for the Suns, and they can’t replace it if he walks after this. All the good teams have dominant big men (AD, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Bam) and Ayton counters them perfectly while also contributing on the offensive end. He ain’t no Drummond/Deandre Jordan empty stats lob catcher who can’t score either lol"
they aren't that serious anyways but losing fucking deandre ayton doesn't drop them to a 7 or below seed
In what world does MPJ AND SHAI get a max rookie extension but not Deandre Ayton??? Man locked up every big man in the playoffs and had his breakout moment with the game winner. I’m so confused by this
Well if I was in your shoes I would be excited about the fact that I will be getting fully engaged and motivated and in “F U you were wrong about me” Deandre Ayton this year.   That increases your chances at a championship.
"Ayton is absolutely a max player. He's had to sacrifice more than anyone on that teams stats to do all the dirty work and still produced terrific.   Given the amount of awful contracts being given out on a daily basis, Ayton is worthy of a max from pretty much any team. Suns costing themselves a chance at a title if Deandre becomes disgruntled."
"Deandre Ayton could comfortably get you 18/11 but the Suns have designed their offense to be centred around Booker and CP3.  Force feed him a couple possessions (right now the Suns run zero plays for him) and he's suddenly a 20/11 player who happens to be one of the only players that can defend Jokic, Embiid &amp; Giannis while somewhat punishing teams for playing small.  I think that type of player (with his youth and opportunity to develop) is $25M+ probably closer to $30M.  $35M might not be an ideal price tag but that's the cost of competing. There isn't anyone on the market that comes close to replacing Deandre Ayton. Capela might give you 85% of Deandre Ayton at half the cost but that's about it and the Hawks aren't giving up Capela without netting an insane package, Capela has been instrumental to them rising from Lottery-bound to the ECF."
"I think youre massively underestimating how teams would go after Ayton if he hit the market. SO many of the guys you mentioned teams sticking to would have taxis called for them in an instant to get Ayton in the door The thunder would instantly have a fantastic, young core with all their picks to supplement, they dont have a rim protector or finisher. Ayton fixes both issues instantly. You want a Shai/Ayton PNR? I would, thats incredible.   You want to bet on Kai Jones if youre the hornets? Its lunacy to look at Deandre Ayton and think, nah ill roll the dice on Kai Jones. Do I want to pair my star PG with one of the best Centers in the league or do I want to bet Jones finds a way to play defense and rebound in the NBA like he never did in college? Its not like Jones was even a better 3pt shooter in college than ayton was, but hey i guess hes from the bahamas too so hes got that going for him  For the knicks Ayton is better at everything that Robinson and Noel do, and has more in his bag. theres no reason to think the team that believes those guys are good to pair with their core but someone who is better in every way wouldnt fit. Hed be a perfect core piece  The rockets would pack the bags for every young big on that roster for a chance at Ayton for them, pairing Ayton with a 4 who can stretch the floor in Wood is a perfect combination. You tell the rockets that you can pair Green, Porter, Wood, and Ayton they sign up for it before you finish the sentence.  The kings would send Holmes out of town praying you took Buddy's contract with him faster than Fox can run the fast break. Who is better to pair with Fox and Haliburtan than a big in ayton who can run the floor better than some wings? Its a perfect combination and instantly solves their defensive issues at the rim as well. I really enjoy homes' energy but hes a sieve on defense  The blazers would see stars their heads would snap to attention so fast if they could ditch Nurkic and Covington for Ayton. A lineup of Lillard, Mccollum, Powell, Nance, and Ayton not only competes in the west, it keeps Lillard in town. This is a no brainer and the blazers front office might pray for the opportunity. Ayton solves their defensive issues at the rim instantly, gives them a big who can actually switch into space, and creates so much gravity around the rim Dame would feel like hes shooting in practice he would have so much space to operate. CP3 just spent a whole season doing this.   The mavs would throw Porzingis out the front door like Jazz in the fresh price for Ayton.   The celtics might be the quickest of them all to move Horford, Williams, or both. He would be the perfect big to pair with Brown and Tatum. Low usage, incredibly efficient, fantastic switchable defense. Thats everything that want from Horford and Williams but better.   I really think youre massively underrating Ayton, these teams would jump at the opportunity to get a player like ayton, even on a max"
"I would love to see us getting DeAndre Ayton ad a RFA. We have over 30M next season, I would even throw him a max tbh."
"Welcome future Laker big, DeAndre Ayton."
What a shitty take.  Deandre Ayton isn't a max player by any stretch of the imagination.  Obviously the Suns front office agrees.
I have a feeling if most teams were trying to avoid giving Deandre Ayton a max people would call them smart but since its the suns everyone is losing their minds
"That 1 decision probably played a big factor which is the important part and main point. Players remember this kind of stuff, deandre ayton is literally being reported as being unhappy lmao.   And the rfa and team control stuff doesn't mean shit in the player empowerment era."
This guy is certainly not passing on a max  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23854252/deandre-ayton-nba-success-getting-second-deal
"No reason to kick Deandre Ayton when he's down, Adam."
"Percentage of field goals made assisted for Deandre Ayton:  2018-19: 71.1%  2019-20: 74.8%  2020-21: 71.6%  The difference with CP3 was just that he got him more looks around the basket as opposed to jumpers, which Ayton was awful at."
One deandre Ayton please
Not sure why you brought up bam but bam shot 47% from 10-15 feet on 156 attempts. Deandre ayton shot 49% on 80 total attempts from 10-15 feet
"Ayton is not a max player. I see him as another DeAndre Jordan with better FT%. He also has the luxury of playing with CP3 as his pg.  We all know what he did for DJ.  Deandre Ayton = DeAndre Jordan.   Sorry buddy, but it's Booker's team. Don't get offended with the no offer and keep working on your game."
Deandre Jordan looked really good playing with cp3. Same with Ayton. He does typical big man things. The only thing that I’ll give him is that he can defend the pick and rolls pretty well at an elite level. But he’s nothing too special out of it.
Sources say u/Be-booboo-bop is also “very unhappy” with the Phoenix Suns and their inability to come to terms with a contract extension with Deandre Ayton
"Jarrett Allen DRAPTOR past 3 years(regular season): -2.8, +2.1, +1.7  Deandre Ayton DRAPTOR past 3 years(regular season): -1.7, +3.0, +1.0  Jarrett Allen DLEBRON past 3 years: 1.72, 1.94, .75  Deandre Ayton DLEBRON past 3 years: -0.23, 0.55, 0.55"
"But Ayton is only 23 getting him doesn’t just make you good for the next season it makes you good for the next 10 seasons. And I don’t get why getting ayton would stop you from having a loaded team, you would still have all your picks to draft good players and it’s hard to imagine okc getting as good of a free agent as an about to enter his prime deandre ayton."
"Yeah! I doubt he would come though. It all comes down to who offer the most, if the Suns wanna match anything, if other teams have the same cap space but are better places than San Antonio. DeAndre Ayton would be such a dream for us that I already count this out lmao."
*changes name to Deandre Ayton Jr.*
"Signing a 36 year old Chris Paul to a 4 years/$120m but refusing to give DeAndre Ayton a rookie scale max coming off a fantastic playoffs where he averaged 16 ppg / 12 rbs / 1 blk / 1 stl with 65.8% FG%, where they went to the finals.....  Ok suns..."
"Damian Lillard, Paul George, Deandre Ayton"
"Well, Hornets Chandler was good but not DPoY levels yet like he was in Dallas and NY.   Deandre Jordan, kinda iffy with him. He wasn’t really that good to me. He was all-nba by default at the time.   Capela is a great rim protector and can switch on to some perimeter guys off the switch and was considered a fringe all-star/S+role player at the time.   DeAndre Ayton is young but is showing signs of his offensive potential. Defense can use some work but yea, still young.   So Imma have to go Ayton, Capela, Chandler, DJ."
"I don't know why people are so reluctant to say this. DeAndre Ayton deserves a max contract.   I swear it feels you all are living in 2014 or something when only All NBA guys got 30 million a year. Ayton is a player on an all-star trajectory. In this current climate, Ayton should get a max. That's just how NBA is."
That's our future center DeAndre Ayton (pls)
"You're right man. You could get another pick and that pick could be anything, it could be Deandre Ayton!"
"DeAndre, Ayton, Capela, Adams, Chandler"
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF DEANDRE AYTON
DeAndre Ayton in shambles rn
"Suns, so basically f#$%&amp;^g up a contending team by disrespecting and alienating your young talent by trying to underpay/under value them.  First Joe Johnson, now Deandre Ayton"
DeAndre Ayton should have replayed the Valley Oop at the beginning of every meeting with Sarver.

"&gt;he got cooked on defense because he was literally the only option with Jamal Murray out, and had to carry the team on offense to even keep it respectable.  Nah, they picked on him on every possession, just like I've been watching been done to him for years. He's simply too slow to hedge on screens well  &gt;and calling something hilarious because you don’t feel like finding out ur wrong, is in fact, hilarious.  Bruh, no offense...but you have no idea at all what you're talking about. You just told me that DeAndre Ayton, who didn't even play half the season, and missed the playoffs...was a more impactful defensive player than Anthony Davis. So I'd say 'hilarious' is a mostly fitting term"
"Talking about guys who mainly play center. Of course Giannis is going to be more versatile. You can probably write AD in at center, and he is better defensively, for sure. But those issues about rotations and help defense have gotten better in his sophomore season and mostly disappeared over the course of this season. Talking about versatility, among centers, he defends as many mid-range and corner 3 attempts as AD, affects the mid-range as much as Bam, and protects the rim better than Bam. But that's DFGA and DFG% which is always a bit, bleh. It can show DeAndre Jordan as a DPOY candidate.  Plenty of defensive assessment is looking at how a player blows up plays and affects opponents shots. [Here is an article about one of those Clippers games, where you can see how well he played even against the 5-out.](https://thefourpointplay.substack.com/p/vol2-iss19-deandre-ayton-has-arrived) Yes, it's from a Suns fan, but this dude goes over film like no one's business. It's also taking clips from one of his better games in the playoffs, but having watched all the Suns games last season, I promise he started looking like this around the all-star break and turned it up to force LeBron to the 3 point line and AD into the mid-range, shut down the offense running through the MVP, drove the Clippers to play 5-out and still struggle. He just fell short against a monstrous Giannis, but so did the rest of the league."
"He was a top 5 player in 2015,18,and 20 and a top 2 player in the bubble lmao   Even this year he put up two 34/10 games before getting hurt in the playoffs against DeAndre Ayton who's a great defender"
"This is like Booker, Bridges, and Ayton lined up against the wall and Sarver says ""whoever wants a big contract extension please step forward .... not so fast Deandre""  if Shamet gets an extension before the season ends before Ayton, i expect Deandre to check himself out and quit in the team (most likely wont happen)"
"I see how much they are throwing at a scoring 13ppg and I can't understand how they aren't Deandre Ayton yet.   I mean, I don't want to be dismissive of Bridges. He's shown improvement each year, and I'm happy for him.  But if they think he is important enough to drop 90 million over four years on, why are they not getting a deal done with Ayton, who is so important to the team defensively, especially when they have to play in the west where they'll potentially meet with any combination of AD, Joker, KAT, and Zion."
good deal. now we wait for deandre ayton…

Lmao.  Lakers fans: can we have DeAndre Ayton?   Lakers: we have a DeAndre at home.   DeAndre at home:
"In my opinion, Zion is the closest comparison even though there’s no similar player to Shaq in the modern NBA. People will say Embiid cause he plays in the post but he plays a lot of face up (although he is very dominant when he backs into defenders) and stretches the floor wayyyy more than Shaq, Embiids play style is closer to Hakeem.        People will say Giannis because he has finesse around the rim and will straight up body people if he has to but he   handles the ball more than Shaq, he’ll bring it up court for a few plays, some give and gos at the top of the arc or attempt to stretch the floor.       Zion is similar to Giannis but Zions style is so aggressive on the offensive end, sometimes he’ll shoot not for the purpose of scoring but for the purpose of getting the rebound in a better position so he can lay it back in. His rebounding and inside scoring is already at an elite level and he has deceptive speed like Shaq did which is something a lot of people forget about Shaq is that if he felt like it, he could take the ball coast to coast once or twice a game.         With that being said, there’s no wrong answer if you’re going with one of these three but the answer is for sure not DeAndre Ayton. At least not for right now."
"True, but IMO he's still closer to DeAndre than Shaq. That's more of a statement on how good Shaq is, less about Ayton."
DeAndre Ayton gonna snag the bag soon.
Deandre Ayton reminds him of Shaq more than Embiid and Giannis?

"Okay this sounds absurd right now.. but I think this could happen.   Deandre Ayton to the Mavs.   He’s a perfect complement to Luka.

The depth of league at center is way less than it is at guard and forward. If someone like Embiid or Jokic gets hurt its definitely possible ayton could sneak into 3rd team if the Suns have one of the top records in the NBA.   All-NBA voters tend to favor players on teams with better records. Just look at DeAndre Jordan making All-NBA in 2017 over KAT Cousins while putting up only 13 pts with 14 rbs.
"Deandre Ayton is a beast…. Does need to get more aggressive though, he acted soft too many times last season when he should’ve been using his size to bully, but that’s still cause he’s learning. Pay the man and keep him, he will only get better!"
Future mav deandre ayton
I mean they gotta at some point but I 100% understand the reservations on fully maxing Deandre Ayton.
•Deandre Ayton will remember that.
"Yeah the second greatest pure point ever, who's also also a top 40 player all-time, one of the best closers in the game and someone respected by every person who knows or watches hoops is more valueable than someone who heavily thrives off Paul. People thought Deandre Jordan was the best center in the league because of what cp3 does for bigs. Cp3 helped Tyson Chandler, Dj, Griffin, Ayton and capella. Yes I am very biased"
In my unbiased opinion MVP: Devon Booker MIP: Mikal Bridges DPOY: Deandre Ayton 6MOY: Cameron Payne ROY: Jalen Green
"No, the reason is that Nash needs to be able to maintain credibility with the players either way. If KD and Harden disagree with each other and Marks and Tsai side with one over the other, then this harms the relationship between one of them and the FO.  But it DOESN'T harm the relationship with Nash.  This is the same reason Monty Williams isn't involved in the decision to extend DeAndre Ayton - so he can be like ""look guys if it was up to me I'd totally give everyone their money."""
Have you checked in on the Ayton saga?? He is mad he isn't getting first overall pick money like Luka and Trey. He feels disrespected and he is waiting for the Suns to respond with a max extension on his contract  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/breaking-down-the-messy-contractual-standoff-between-deandre-ayton-and-the-suns/amp/
"Ayton will be an RFA, so if the Suns want him for the next four years, they can have him for the next four years if they're willing to pay the max for three of them. There's no ""bailing"" for a restricted free agent of his caliber.  The only major thing they risk by playing hardball and going into RFA is the option to have him for an additional two years on the max (5-year, no-option max vs matched 3+1 offer sheet from another team), when Chris Paul will be _checks notes_ 40 and 41.  Especially with how the John Collins situation played out, I think the Suns are doing the smart thing. I don't actually think OKC or Charlotte are that interested in tying up cap space for three days by signing Deandre Ayton to Schrodinger's max contract."

"I couldn't disagree more. Micic was last years Euroleague MVP at age 27 and he was drafted 7 years ago. Luka was the Euroleague MVP at age 19. Big difference. MVP of the second best league in the world at 19...?! For that you have to take him nr1 for talent alone. Luka being nr1 was written in stone 100%, at least for us Europeens who saw him play (and saw Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III play)"

"&gt;Just Google 2018 draft big board. &gt; &gt;A bunch of those had Ayton as number one.  That depends on whether the site is ranking players as prospects, or predicting how the actual draft will go. Most mocks try to predict the actual order, even if they don't personally agree with it.  The Suns made it pretty obvious they were taking the local guy, there were plenty of pre-draft articles like this:  - [Suns set to pick Deandre Ayton at No. 1 in NBA draft, but there's more drama at No. 16](https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2018/06/20/phoenix-suns-nba-draft-pick-deandre-ayton-drama-espn/719957002/)  - [Deandre Ayton Plans to Go No. 1 in NBA Draft, Only Work Out For Suns](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/06/06/deandre-ayton-plans-no-1-nba-draft-pick-only-work-out-suns)  - [Most experts now agree Deandre Ayton will be 1st No. 1 draft pick in Suns history](https://www.abc15.com/sports/sports-blogs-local/most-experts-agree-deandre-ayton-will-be-the-suns-1st-ever-no-1-overall-draft-pick)  So if you were doing a mock, you'd put Ayton at #1 even if you thought it was a bad decision."
The fact they won’t max him could lead to Deandre Ayton being in that mix.
"I assume you’re talking the Raptors and Heat series the Nets at no point successfully walled him off, even in game 2 which was the one shitty game he had.  Are you sure you’ve seen a basketball before? You’re definitely talking about the right sport here? The Brooklyn Nets, with I guess KD, Nicholas Claxton and the corpses of Blake Griffin and LMA, are more suited to defend Giannis than the Phoenix Suns with Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder (who was Giannis’ primary defender on the 2020 Heat, a series you clearly remember well)? This is what I’m talking about, there’s skepticism and there’s delusion."

"He's a weird player tbh  Can give you 15 easy points on like 9 shots but doesn't do much else  Basically he's like ""what if Deandre Ayton was smaller and couldn't play defense?"""
"“You know, deandre ayton wanting to get paid kind of reminds me of those people who think trump won the election”"
"Ayton tried the face up game when he first got into the league.  It wasn't that great because it just turned into turnaround 2s without drawing fouls.  What he did in HS like 4 years ago is pretty irrelevant.  Ayton broke out last year (and by break out, I mean became a meaningful contributor on a playoff team, not superstar) by embracing the DeAndre Jordan type of roll.  He's terrific in that role, but that role is inherently limited (although against a team like last year's Clippers it was invaluable; Ayton could punish small lineups on offense, unlike Gobert)."
"Understandable on both ends. I don’t think he’s a max-player but any player in his position would see themselves as one.   Ayton is one of the better bigs in the league, but you can get somebody that brings 80% of what he does for a lot cheaper. And while he does a lot of things well, he doesn’t really do anything at an all-league level.   I know a lot of the sub think it’s ridiculous the team isn’t throwing max money at him, but we often neglect to realize that players have skill floors. If they’re relatively good at lots of things- you can reasonably expect them to substantially improve at those things, but Ayton isn’t a great rim protector, hasn’t developed an outside shot, and has a rudimentary post game. He won’t be Embiid, and shouldn’t be paid like him.   Even minimum guys like Dedmon give you 65% of DeAndre Ayton’s impact at an insane discount."
Deandre Ayton finna sign with Klutch if Sarver keeps cheaping out
Same I was thinking I did not expect Giannis to say his hardest opponent was Deandre Ayton lol
"DeAndrew Jordan has a 67.4 FG% for his CAREER. He got over 70% multiple times and averaged like 12-13 ppg doing so.   Ayton got 14.4 ppg on 62.6 FG% this year - though he did get 18.2 and 16.3 ppg in the last 2 years, though on a much worse efficiency.   Both players had hyper insane efficiency due to being spoon-fed lobs and dunks. There was a time where DeAndre Jordan was considered a good center, similar to Ayton today, then well... the rest of his career happened. I'm not saying that Ayton is DeAndre Jordan. Maybe he'll become a top 5 center similar to Embiid, but he gotta show more than he did this past season."
DeAndre Ayton is definitely not a max player and most likely will never be. This will be an albatross of a contract that will be impossible to move in the future. The top posts in this thread are bonkers.
"And neither of those players were sure fire max extensions, either.  Keeping Ayton, a traditional center, around for his first 7 years with a risk of him leaving versus his first 9 years (but for a lot of extra money) is a risk I'd be willing to take.  If he were in the superstar stratosphere (or even if he had the potential be be one), maybe it's a larger concern?  I think Ayton tops out as, what, 3rd team All NBA?  If he hits a 2nd or 1st team (due to injuries), I think he's closer to DeAndre Jordan than, say, Embiid or Jokic last year."
"If fucking Michael Porter and John Collins got max contracts, Deandre Ayton deserves one"
How tf is it disrespectful. Seems to me like you don’t watch Suns games so look at the stats.   DeAndre Ayton at 22 years old: 14.4ppg 10.5rpg 1.2bpg 62.6FG% 77FT% 30mpg  Rudy Gobert at 22: 8.4ppg 9.5rpg 2.3bpg 60FG% 62.3FT% 26.3mpg
Holy shit this sub. Dwight Howard can give 75% of the production of Deandre Ayton? What world am I in.
"&gt;Well ideally you don’t want to have DeAndre Ayton making max contract money. He’s good but he’s not a superstar, he’s a second tier All-Star at best. He’ll likely never be able to carry the scoring load that you’d ideally want your second best player to be able to.  I mean I would have given him the max money over what they gave CP3 because it'll be cheaper and he's younger."
All these Suns fans angry about this are going to conveniently forget this when they realize how limited Ayton is post-CP3.  Ayton is Deandre Jordan Plus.
"Deandre Ayton, as he is right now, is not a max contract level player. He’s young, and he probably will live up to the value of that contract if they give it to him, but as of *right now* he’s not worth $30 million. If they give him that contract and he does not improve at all, which I think is unlikely but possible, that will be seen as a bad contract."
Who the fuck is deandre ayton to demand a trade?
"&gt; Ayton, 23, is eligible for a five-year, $172.5 million extension, with escalators that could reach $207 million -- a deal that many executives leaguewide expected would be complete in short order this offseason.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32342241/phoenix-suns-deandre-ayton-negotiations-max-rookie-extension-stalled-sources-say"

"You cut out the best part  &gt;""Chris Paul and Devin Booker are All-Stars, but Deandre Ayton is a quality center, Jae Crowder is an experienced, quality stretch-four man that’s tough, Cam Johnson is nice and **Mikal Bridges is my favorite small forward in the league.""**"
"Basing that off what? He got destroyed by AD in the bubble playoffs (was the 4th best player in that series) and then got swept by Deandre ayton and the suns. Gotta be able to win on the biggest stages to be considered the greatest at anything, especially with all of the legends that played at the position"
"Jaylen Brown and Robert Williams for Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton. Aytons value is a bit lower now with the whole contract negotiation, and Williams/Ayton's defense is comparable"
trade Tatum for Deandre Ayton
No offense to John Collins but teams are gonna be willing to tie up cap space for Deandre Ayton. He’s a legit #1 pick who’s over shadowed by being in Luka and Traes class and on Devin Bookers team. He’s probably one of the most talented big men in the league while also being one of the best all around defensively and he’s only 23. His floor is being an elite rim runner who can hit his free throws and his ceiling is being a bigger bam adebayo. The suns are fucking up with a great talent just because he’s not luka.
&gt; DeAndre Ayton. Might be a hot take but this was the wrong move.  have you been on this sub before?!?!

"This is not the same Warriors team tho... and remember, we have to consider if Klay comes back and gets outplayed by Poole and others/allowing Klay to chill and continue to rehab more while coming back slower than everybody anticipates he will need to. Which makes him deadlier come playoff time.  And... what if Wiseman returns, *awake*, more along the lines of a Robert Williams or DeAndre Ayton or Jarrett Allen?  These are plausible realities we can see."
"For those curious, here's the debut game from the last ten #1 overall picks:  Name | PTS | AST | REB | STL | BLK | FG | FGA | 3P | 3PA | FT | FTA | MP ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Kyrie Irving | 6 | 7 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 12 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 26:01 Anthony Davis | 21 | 0 | 7 | 1 | 1 | 6 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 9 | 29:04 Anthony Bennett | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 14:59 Andrew Wiggins | 6 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 18:33 Karl-Anthony Towns | 14 | 1 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 31:53 Ben Simmons | 18 | 5 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 34:40 Markelle Fultz | 10 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 17:54 Deandre Ayton | 18 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 1 | 8 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 36:29 Zion Williamson | 22 | 3 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 11 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 18:18 Anthony Edwards | 15 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 12 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 25:09  Nothing too crazy. Simmons and Ayton both had great games. I feel like Zions was the most memorable though, 22 points in 18 minutes, 4/4 on threes, even though the Pelicans lost that was still a fun game. Oh and on that note: Edwards, Ayton, Towns, and Bennett all won their debut. Fultz, Simmons, Wiggins, Davis, Irving, and like I said Zion all lost their debut.  ^^^hopefully ^^^there ^^^aren't ^^^any ^^^mistakes ^^^in ^^^there"
Agreed. Look at the suns. Their third best player last year was probably Deandre Ayton and they lost in the finals.
Plus they don’t want to pay Deandre Ayton smh.
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
"&gt;Most prolific alley-oop duo (credit to lactardenthusiast for the idea)  &gt;**Clint Capela &amp; Trae Young (69)**  &gt;Mike Conley &amp; Rudy Gobert (39)  &gt;DeAndre Jordan &amp; James Harden, **John Collins &amp; Trae Young (32)**  &gt;Deandre Ayton &amp; Devin Booker (31)  Damn! I watch the Hawks, and even I didn’t notice how many oops compared to the rest of the league that Trae connects on. There’s a new lob city now!"
&gt; any stat that has deandre ayton and clint capela over luka doncic can't have much merit behind it  Like rebounds per game and FG%?
"Not to give in to the obvious troll, but the Deandre Ayton has the best defensive rating on the team (109 tied with Torrey Craig per BBREF), highest defensive win shares (3.1), highest rebound rate and block rate, and a 54.3 DFG% (Embiid is at 53.9).  &amp;#x200B;  This is all on the #2 team in the league with the #6 defensive rating, and a lot of that defensive rating is anchored by Deandre Ayton's good decision making, rotations, and presence in the paint. If you watch a few games you can see it, plain as day, he has been a good defensive player for a while now."
"People love to shit on Wiseman but the Warriors *need* a playable big at the 5 that can help on offense. As much as I love Looney he isn’t as big or athletic. The team would have a hard time against the likes of Gobert, Jokic, Ayton, Ibaka, Nurkic, Porzingis, or AD/Drummond, and that’s just in the west. In a Finals matchup they’d need to face the best of Embiid, Giannis, or DeAndre Jordan/Blake Griffin."
"Suns fans have the same gripes with DeAndre Ayton, it'll come with time, they're both important defensive centers for playoff teams."
Haha yeah he sure does. Has that Greg oden / DeAndre Ayton look going for him
What are you even talking about. They rested players on a b2b which they done literally for two years straight now. Every playoff team who has their seeding situation set have been resting Donovan injured could have been back resting instead. DeAndre ayton rested last night. Kawhi and company been doing it since middle of march.  Jokic can't since his team been injured.  Curry literally resting tonight to get ready for Sunday. Ja Morant doing the same thing.
Deandre Ayton has been so good this series. Shout out to Cam Payne too. Lots of people are learning how good he’s been for us since jointing the team in the bubble.
Deandre Ayton looks like Master Oogway
Deandre Ayton simultaneously looks like he’s 21 and 48 at the same time
Deandre Ayton looks like a knockoff version of Joel Embiid.

That's number one pick Deandre Ayton
LORD FORGIVE ME FOR ALL THE SHIT IVE TALKED ABOUT DEANDRE AYTON
Deandre Ayton has a relationshiip with the coach?
why deandre ayton
In the Deandre Ayton pick and roll yes.  Optimally AD should start at the 5 and both Drummond and Gasol should barely play
Embiid is going to murder this version of Gasol.    Lakers can’t even defend Deandre Ayton lol.
Kawhi is Deandre Ayton
Kawhi is Deandre Ayton
Imagine choosing Marvin Bagley and DeAndre Ayton over this guy
"Yes he can, he’s a good one on one defender but what he struggles with is help defense. Anthony Davis against Deandre Ayton: 10-26 (38%)"
"I mean, I feel like if we got a wing upgrade (KAWHI PLS, ARIZONA IS BASICALLY LA) then I would like our chances.   CP3, Book, Kawhi, Bridges, and Deandre Ayton   With Cam Payne, Saric, Cam Johnson, and Crowder off of the bench."
"I thought the officiating was better this game than Game 2 - but the Lakers are still allowed a lot more liberties on defense.  It is going to frustrate a team if they are being pushed around on one end of the floor, and called for ticky tack fouls on the other.  Deandre Ayton has 3 free throws so far in this series. Three. Not three.per game. Three total."
"Deandre Ayton stats for...  * First half: 10pts (5/5), 6 Rebounds * Second half: 12pts (6/10), 5 Rebounds  You make it sounds like he was shut down. His efficiency dropped but he scored more and took more shots."
my biggest takeaway from our series so far is that deandre ayton is way better than i thought
"We've focused our entire defense on slowing their entire perimeter as hard as we can, it's the main reason why deandre ayton has looked like prime shaq and they've barely cracked 100 once and been held under 90 twice, and also do you not see just how terrible our offense has been?"

"The top individual defenders against Jokic this year in no order were Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton (but mostly just in the 3rd/final PHX matchup), Clint Capela (in the first matchup with ATL, not the second), and ROBIN LOPEZ of all people. That's really been it this year."
"I hate watching this series because the lakers get all the damn calls, it doesn’t help that the suns can’t shoot for shit right now, but all the Lakers do is draw fouls and bitch. Between game 2 and game 3 deandre ayton has shot one free throw, ONE. I don’t care how good the lakers are or think they are, their getting helped out by the refs in the series."
"He did... in year 1. Then Monty Williams got hired and he stopped using him in the post. Watch Ayton highlights from his rookie year. Even last year, at least he took mid-range shots. It’s tragic how he went from a imposing post and face-up threat to a Clint Capela/ Deandre Jordan type player.   Monty Williams, as great as he is, needs to be held accountable. There needs to be a middle ground in adjusting his role for current success and developing his game for the future."
Refuse to believe anyone un ironically believes Deandre Ayton is the best player on the suns

I'm not trying to say Booker is as good as Kobe was or that he ever will be. But Booker never got to play with Shaq. It wasn't *just* Kobe doing all that.  Booker's best teammate before last year was probably Eric Bledsoe or a rookie DeAndre Ayton.
"Mikal Bridges is the best player in the 2018 draft, with Deandre Ayton being a close second"
"Just throwing this out there, Deandre Ayton exists and was the anchor to the sixth best defense in the league. He also can’t be played off the floor defensively because he’s a really good perimeter defender as well as a rim protector. The playoffs have put his defense on display and people are noticing that he’s an all-defense caliber guy."
"Out of curiosity I ranked players by PPG to see how many have a negative AST/TO. The only players with negative ratios in the top 100 are:    Embiid - 2.8/3.1   MPJ - 1.1/1.3   John Collins - 1.2/1.3   Clint Capela - 0.8/1.2   DeAndre Ayton - 1.4/1.5   Rudy Gobert - 1.3/1.7   Darius Bazley - 1.8/2.2   Lauri Markannen - 0.9/1.0   Brook Lopez - 0.7/0.9    That’s the list. 91 other players are able to shoulder a scoring burden without having a negative ratio, regardless of their position or role in the offense.   The thing all these guys have in common? No handles. I think if Embiid wants to take another step towards being the most dominant player in the league has has to work on his handles and reading the defense when he’s double-teamed in the post."
"Lesson learned from this year, players develop and change over time, and a singular Covid year of wiseman is not necessarily an indicator of his success next year.  See: Deandre Ayton, Reggie Jackson, Trae Young"
The disrespect to DeAndre Ayton
I mean Trae's got a good chance of a Trae Young vs. Devin Booker/Deandre Ayton finals in 3 to 4 weeks
"You know, I wanted to come at this comment because on its face it seems absurd, but let’s go to the numbers. Jokic was picking his shots and scoring in Aytons face, he had that nice triple double in game 3, and he did nicely overall in that series. Let’s look at the stats.  Jokic points went 22, 24, 32, and 22 (granted he fouled out in the last one)  Ayton had 20, 15, 10, and 20.  Jokic had 9, 13, 20, 11 rebounds.  Ayton had 10, 10, 15, 7 rebounds.   Even just looking at the stat lines, its clear Jokic had a leg up on Ayton in those games. But that’s without seeing the reaction from Ayton himself: https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/nba-playoffs-suns-nuggets-watch-deandre-aytons-hilarious-reaction-to-nikola-jokics-stat-line  &gt;”Yup, he’s the MVP”  I think it’s clear Jokic is a better player than Ayton, right now. But why wouldn’t he be? He’s got tons more experience, he’s the MVP, he knows his game. Ayton is just starting.  I think what’s clear from looking at the stat lines is that, aside from game 3, that’s not the performance I’d expect from an MVP in a playoff series. Ayton clearly had enough of an impact that Jokic was not simply having his way on the court. Jokic isn’t averaging 35 points a game.   Give the man his due. Ayton did. Can’t we all just get along and get back to what’s important: making fun of Ben Simmons?"
It's getting harder and harder to leave DeAndre Ayton off this list.
"Deandre Ayton is the 3rd best player on his team, and Trae Young missed 18 out of 23 shots while having 6 turnovers in a game 7. Now imagine if those teams had Luka instead."
"Nobody is debating that he’s better on offense. But he’s not a more versatile defender than the 3 time DPOY what are you talking about. I didn’t say he was the 2nd option on offense, I said he’s the 2nd best player. And ayton is third because he feeds off other players on his team, he gets lobs and dump offs. Mikal Bridges is a better offensive player than deandre ayton"
I think if one team figures out the other through adjustments it's the Suns. Clippers also have a few things they can fix but fatigue + already giving them the smallball looks and not having great success + no Kawhi makes their margin of error minute. Like I know he's been great for 9 games but Reggie Jackson was ridiculous last night.    Devin Booker was robbed of his all nba selection.   Terance Mann is dope and Pfizer P will be awesome to witness.   The chess match in the first half was compelling but the second half with the superstars going off and the Mikal showing in the fourth quarter was better.   I know that it's discounting the Clippers majorly and it will not go that way cause they're just that good at shooting but my feel has been Suns in 5 idk. I'd say 6 it's much more likely though.  Deandre Ayton can do some things better but he was great overall. Helped shut down PG when he stopped dropping on him in the 4th.

"Deandre Ayton's impact was noticeable from the start of game 1; the first real low post, and rim-diving scoring threat that the Clips have faced this first post-season. And it's put Lue in a big conundrum.   Go big at Center with with Zubac and Cousins and risk getting torched in pick and roll coverage (similar to Luka and Mitchell), although Booker prefers to do his damage in the midrange - snaking his way through an Ayton screen and getting to the free-throw line elbow. If Zubac/Cousins drops or doesn't step up fast enough, it's an easy midrange jumper. Trap too fast, and Ayton roles unimpeded to the rim.  Go small with Morris/Batum/PG as the 5, and any dribble penetration that gets into the paint creates a passing lane for Ayton, who finishes remarkarbly well. Unlike Gobert in the series before, Ayton doesn't necessarily needs to be spoonfed the ball for a lob dunk/layup, easily versatile enough to finish with a hook short or quick dribble into better position. Equally important, he's a big body that boxes out well and a threat for an offensive rebound on an otherwise good defensive possession for LA.  On the other end, PHX perimeter defense is better than Utah's, making it just a smidge more difficult for dribble penetration - Ayton's asked less to protect rim and is allowed to stay closer to the LA corner 3s. He still has issues closing up fast enough on high pick and rolls to step into 3s (PG hit back to back ones in the 3rd), but this is difficult for virtually all big men and not Ayton exclusive.   I thought it was interesting that for a period in the late 3rd/early 4th, Lue decided to try out a big lineup of Morris + Zubac/Cousins for a few minutes, just to see what type of result you would get. At least defensively, Book and Payne answered that real quick with a quick 8 points, showing the obvious issues it would present on try to defend 2 quick, good shooting guards."
"Tell them to watch Deandre Ayton defend in the playoffs... Maybe they'll learn a thing or two ;-) and all that elite defense WITHOUT FOULING :-) yes, it can be done..."
"&gt;Paul George on Deandre Ayton's impact: ""Yeah, it's different. Ayton is a little bit more agile, more of a presence down low, and a better finisher than the other bigs we faced.""  That's cause the Clips tried desperately to duck Anthony Davis. They can't even deal with J.V. Davis AKA Deandre Ayton."
Do NOT call him a big. Put some respect on DA's name.     Context: https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/deandre-ayton-phoenix-suns-basketball-nba
"I remember when people used to say ""Mavs in the playoffs, Suns in the lottery"" last year as one of the reasons Luka is better than Ayton and when the Suns have progressed 2 more rounds than the Mavs this year already all a sudden postseason success isn't as important as Darko won a chip before wade and bron. Darko played a total of 14 minutes that entire postseason run. Not 14 minutes per game or per series but the entire postaseson. Deandre Ayton plays 35.5 mpg this postseason so far. People so often use playoff success as a barometer for players and all of a sudden it doesn't matter."
"I tried to be a Ben Simmons apologist. Sorry, Benny. I can’t anymore. I’m switching to being a full time DeAndre Ayton enthusiast."
"The Top 5 picks have all had something to offer. From 5th to first:  * Trae Young is clutch as nails and the face of the Hawks' turnaround. * Jaren Jackson has had injury problems, but was a starter on a playoff team and has shown some All-Star potential. * Luka Doncic is already showing signs of being a future first-ballot Hall-of-Famer. * Marvin Bagley * DeAndre Ayton is a great defensive center and one of the best finishers at the rim in the league."
Agreed.  My gut tells me Ayton and Booker is better.  Ayton also can make up for a lot of defensive deficiencies around him because he's so active in rotations from what I've seen.  It's just harder to approximate what Deandre Ayton gives you as opposed to Luka.
"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, what a top 3 in that draft."
Man. Deandre Ayton has the same energy as Broxh. That super wholesome carving streamer
need more DeAndre/CP3 type lobs out of Ayton/CP3/Booker off the pnr
"This pretty much adds to what you say.   Two highest scorers on Devin Booker's teams (Besides Booker himself).  2016 - Eric Bledsoe (20.4 PPG and only played 31 games). Brandon Knight (19.6 PPG and only played 52 games).  2017 - Eric Bledsoe (21.1 PPG) and TJ Warren (14.4 PPG)  2018 - TJ Warren (19.6 PPG) and Josh Jackson (13.1 PPG).  2019 - TJ Warren (18 PPG) and Kelly Oubre (16.9 PPG).  2020 - Kelly Oubre (18.7 PPG) and Deandre Ayton (18.2 PPG)  Needless to say, Booker hasn't had a lot of offensive help besides Eric Bledsoe and TJ Warren. And if these guys are your primary scorers, I wouldn't like your chances of succeeding as much as I love TJ."
deandre ayton looks like a middle aged man lol.
Actually he pretty much overhauled the roster in one year. But the end of James Jones first full season as GM DeAndre Ayton was the second longest tenured player. Part of his plan was a complete roster overhaul to change the culture. I honestly think that’s half of why Warren was traded - not to hate on Warren but he was jaded by the losing and needed a fresh start (that and we needed the cap space to finally sign a point guard after two seasons of not having a serviceable point guard on the team)
We're watching Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton grow up right before our eyes.
Sometimes I forgot Deandre Ayton is only 22. Another stellar performance from him. Booker is just an elite level player and you have to applaud greatness
Deandre Ayton
Deandre “when the hoes are watching” Ayton
Bro these playoffs have been a coming out party for Deandre Ayton
When deandre ayton is dunking the ball hard it’s a wrap
Deandre Ayton is so pure lol.
Imagine if Deandre Ayton or Trae Young win a ring before Luka
I would die for Deandre Ayton
Deandre Ayton uhhh... he's just too love.
Lord forgive me for all the shit I’ve talked about Deandre Ayton
Deandre Ayton&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rudy Gogurt
DeAndre Ayton needs to eat this series some nom nom shit
"Gotta give massive props to deandre Ayton. I wasn’t sure how good he’d be but damn he is a great player, and has stepped up massively in the postseason"
DeAndre Ayton is a way better perimeter defender than Gobert so I don’t think the Clippers can abuse him the way they did Gobert on the perimeter
Deandre Ayton
Lot of players with the extra 2 letters in their names lmao  DeMarcus Cousins  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De'Andre Hunter  DeAndre' Bembry  Devonte' Graham  De'Aaron Fox  LaMelo Ball  LaMarcus Aldridge  LeBron James  probably more I don't know
Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton were great at holding down the fort against LA tho so I just went with the talent edge of Kawhi
"Say you have Draymond Green. He rotates, the other guys rotate. He can defend Jackson in the mid range and at the 3. Is harder to beat off the dribble.  Say you have Giannis. He is fast enough to defend the other players reasonably and not get exploited.   Say you have RoCo or PJ Tucker. They rotate, defend the perimeter and the paint well.   Say you have Deandre Ayton, good foot work, quick enough to rotate and defend the midrange, and defend the perimeter some.   The Jazz's entire defensive scheme rotates around Gobert's strengths.  They want the offense to meet him at the rim. If he is not defending at the rim, he is not useful on offense or defense."
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
Isn’t that the same with DeAndres in the NBA?  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De’Andre Hunter  DeAndre’ Bembry  I could be missing someone but I think those are the only current 4
Deandre Ayton
until Deandre ayton punishes them for it.  Also the Warriors already did that and did it much better
I am officially starting my Deandre ayton&gt;&gt;&gt; gobert agenda
"TL:DR; “We were wrong to pray to the altar of Luka &amp; shame the Trey Young / Deandre Ayton selections for 3 years. Honestly, we’re all nerds who kiss Bill’s ass and don’t know what we’re doing.”"
Draft Picks are a lottery and getting more lottery tickets is a good thing.  Not all of the stars in the NBA were picked in the top 2.    Past 10 drafts  2010 Best Players  * John Wall (1)  * DeMarcus Cousins (5)  * Gordan Hayward (9)  * Paul George (10)   2011 Best Players  * Kawhi Leonard (15)   * Kyrie Irving (1)   * Kemba Walker (9)   * Klay Thompson (11)   * Jimmy Butler (30)  2012 Best players  * Anthony Davis (1)  * Bradley Beal (3)  * Damien Lillard (6)  * Draymond Green (35)  * Khris Middleton (39)  2013 Best players  * Victor Oladipo (2)  * Giannis Anteokoumpo (15)  * Rudy Gobert (27)  2014 Best Players  * Joel Embiid (3)  * Julius Rangle (7)  * Zach Lavine (13)  * Nikola Jocic (41)  2015 Best Players  * Karl Anthony Towns (1)  * D'Angelo Russell (2)  * Devin Booker (13)  2016 Best players  * Ben Simmons (1)  * Brandon Ingram (2)  * Jaylen Brown (3)  * Domantas Sabonis (11)  * Pascal Siakam (27)  2017 Best players  * Jayson Tatum (3)  * De'Aron Fox (5)  * Donovan Mitchell (13)  * Bam Adebayo (14)  * John Collins (19)  2018 Best players  * Deandre Ayton (1)  * Luca Doncic (3)  * Trae Young (5)  * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (11)  2019 Best Players  * Zion Williamson (1)  * Ja Morant (2)  2020 Best Players  * La Melo Ball (3)
"I'm not a Giannis diehard fan by any means, but I think the bucks would be able to make deeper championship runs/be a consistently better team if he focuses on all-NBA defense and getting efficient buckets only like DeAndre Ayton (though Giannis would have a wider arsenal for offense).   The whole structure of having a maxed ca$h Middleton should allow Giannis to go for 10-15 FGs a game on high efficiency. That would make the bucks scarier than him trying to do KD things on a nightly basis ⚰️  I've been about 10 bucks games since 2017, and tbh Giannis does have freak games where he makes like 3 or 4 3pointers on 50% efficiency -- mostly against shit teams where he has high confidence in the regular season. I suspect playoff pressure is affecting his ability to execute."
"I don't think you would.   I don't even think parity is a worthwhile goal personally, but this would not create parity at all regardless.  It would do the opposite.   Basketball is not football, it's so dependent on stars that even low end all stars will end up going for huge, huge money, to the point where you wouldn't even be able to keep both Brown and Tatum for instance.  Because what NBA teams are selling is not championships, it's simply *hope* of a championship.  And if you don't have at least one of these guys you have no product.  And at the same time that washes away hopes of building through the draft because while you could still compile 2-3 stars that way, you couldn't keep them all beyond their rookie contracts.  You're talking about a one year window before you have to start making choices.  Who would even bother with that.  And meanwhile the NY/LA teams as well as GSW, Chicago, and Miami not only have their pick of the truly elite superstars, but they get all the ring chasers too.   Some stars might take significant discounts to go there because basketball stars are so much more recognizable than football stars and fans are concentrated so much more in cities - they have much more to gain financially in a big market than a football player does.  You couldn't hope to maintain a roster like Boston has now, or one like Phoenix or Utah has.    Not when Vlade is around to offer $250m over four years to Jaylen Brown or DeAndre Ayton or Donovan Mitchell because he busted his last three picks or whatever.  No way."
"He was worse than Deandre Ayton, what do you think"
"I am so happy this is happening to this piece of shit franchise and all the people who choose to defend their actions.   This is what you get for trading Jrue for the trash that is Bledsoe/Adams and worthless picks instead of trying to get into the playoffs and actually be a winning team for once. Don't tell me that Jrue would have left this franchise for absolutely nothing if they actually tried to compete for once, I don't believe it.    Fuck griffins' timeline/plan whatever you want to call it. Look at the suns going all in to compete now with two young guys who've been in the league for a similar time to BI and Zion. Players don't want to sit around and lose while griffin stocks up shitty picks and misses on them year after year. DEANDRE AYTON COULD BE A NBA CHAMPION A MONTH FROM NOW. Watch what the new Knicks decision makers are doing, they're not rotting at the bottom of the league, they went all in.   This is what you get for burning bridges with Lonzo and trying to constantly trade him at every opportunity. I am sure Zion is overjoyed at the prospect of losing the only guy who can hit a three next to him and that has actual chemistry with, while Adams and Bledsoe make millions to brick threes and get in his way.  When he watches BI brick away tens of games in the fourth quarter while Zion can't even get his hands on the ball. I am sure that excites him so much that no one has the Bball IQ to tell him to not do that.  When he sees a brain dead coaching hire of a tv personality who wasn't a good coach ten years ago let alone now.   When you don't even make the playoffs while putting up Shaq like numbers of course you'd want to leave. He saw what the idiots over in Cleveland did to waste LeBron's start of his career, he saw what happened with AD and how the first 7 years of his career where thrown away too. Luke saw those things too and is already taking action.  This generation has too much power to play the tanking loser game, either play to win or get me out of here. If he had any legitimate intention to win anything at any level in the NBA he needs to get away from this franchise ASAP. This is him giving this idiot franchise a chance that they don't deserve. GO INTO THE SEASON WITH THE INTENTION OF WINNING. GO INTO THE SEASON WITH THE INTENTION OF WINNING. GO INTO THE SEASON WITH THE INTENTION OF WINNING. Get rid of the trash that is Bledsoe/Adams, use those  worthless first rounders and BI who is at the height of his value to create a roster that makes some semblance of sense. Hire an actual modern NBA coach, get MDA on the phone right now, give him whatever number he asks for and see how things unfold. Enough is enough."

Deandre Ayton
DeAndre Ayton just had a huge feature about how much he loves the Bahamas and how he's a child of the soil.  Might be a big reason he didn't get Kevin Love's spot...
I just think wiseman has a way higher ceiling. I could really see him being a more athletic explosive Deandre Ayton

"Jalen Rose is a moron, an idiot, bigoted, and most importantly, he apparently knows absolutely nothing whatsoever about either recent Team USA basketball teams in the Olympics, or about who can actually play and represent the United States. Kevin Love is the first white player on the Olympic team since what, John Stockton back in the 90s? The last 6? Men's teams have been all black 0layers. More to the point, DeAndre Ayton COULD NOT play for the USA Olympic team, as he is not a citizen of the United States. He could play in the Olympics, but like many other NBA stars, he would have to play for HIS National team. In this case, that would be the Bahamas.   And contrary to the bullshit narrative Rose is trying to push, Love wasn't the first choice. Hell, he was like the tenth choice. If it weren't for multiple other players opting not to play, this would be yet another team with no white players on it. Much like the majority of the other prognosticators on ESPN, Jalen Rose is a fool, and a bigot who seems to absolutely hate white people."
"Off the top of my head AD (he probably declined with injury), Jarrett Allen, DeAndre Ayton, Zion, Christian Wood, and Robert Williams all would have been more interesting adds than Kevin Love. I'm unaware out of how many of those other 5 turned down Team USA.  But if I had 20 dollars to bet, I'd bet it on this being lobbied for by Kevin Love and his people with Pop and Kerr because he's got one of the worst asset reputations in the whole league, still has 2 years left on his contract, and essentially hasn't proved he can play plus basketball on a contender since 2018."
"He's saying the average NBA center can light it up outside of actual NBA games. If you watch shootarounds you'll see players like DeAndre Ayton and Mitchell Robinson swishing threes.   For example, [here's some workout clips of Mitch](https://youtu.be/WuwCgXSnAUI). These centers kill it every year in open runs where they can show their whole bag"

"Trae is a fine comp, because yes, it is reasonable to say the Mavs could've built a comparable team around Luka, but you absolutely cannot compare it to Deandre Ayton. There's no world where the Mavs could've gotten anything close to the pieces Ayton has around him."
Ya but the most mocks before the lottery is established just ignore the teams and pick the order they think they will go. Like the mock posted abouve from SI was before the lottery. Here is [another one](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/03/13/2018-nba-mock-draft-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-headline-loaded-class/417675002/) before the lottery that had Ayton number 1. [Here](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2018-nba-mock-draft-oklahomas-trae-young-slips-out-of-top-10/) is one that had Bagley 1 and Ayton 2.
"I had a revelation while watching the NBA on TNT last night, when they put the DeAndre Ayton game-winning dunk up on the big screen and they were going back and forth through it in slow motion and talking about what they could have done differently and such. I realized this is what NBA coverage should be like all the time. It was informative and totally riveting.   I give the TNT crew shit sometimes for their old man takes, but they really do know how to do good basketball analysis too."
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
"So that means Luka will make the Decision to come to Atlanta around 2025 then right? Who’s gonna be Chris Bosh in this scenario, Deandre Ayton?"
"I'm proud of the Hawks but let's not pretend if you guys had a do-over you wouldn't take Luka 99 times out of 100. The trade was a historically terrible trade, but Trae has definitely improved it to a bad trade.  I'm a Suns fan and I love DeAndre Ayton, but if we had a do-over, taking Luka is a no brainer."

"I am at least a little bit skeptical of the reported vertical leap results when that machine comes into play. Maybe that's when teams are doing the tests themselves though instead of an objective guy at the combine.  They claimed Deandre Ayton had a 44"" vertical on that thing but it didn't pass the eye test IMO and when I counted the frames in an editor (I've posted about how you can do that before and get a conversion that is at least somewhat reliable in the right circumstances) it came out as 34"".  EDIT: One guy posted below that one way this test can get messed with is by the guy not holding his arm all the way extended when they measure his initial reach."
"Well Luka won 3 games in a 7 game series as the underdog in a series that wasn't supposed to be that close. Acting like he isn't a good player is ridiculous. If DeAndre Ayton doesn't hit that game winning inbound, the Suns lose. By your logic, if he doesn't complete that play or Crowder doesnt make that pass, then none of the Suns players actually played good basketball. You're fucking deluded"
"Thing is, seeing articles very much indicate it was on purpose, [the ringer ](https://www.theringer.com/2021/6/23/22546811/suns-clippers-nba-playoffs-deandre-ayton) for instance"
Deandre Ayton is the only one I would consider.
"as a Luka fan, I'm happy to see DeAndre Ayton and Trae Young have so much playoff success"
**Deandre Ayton** is a **Young Star**  **Marvin Bagley** is **Salvageable** (lol)  **Luka Doncic** is an **All-Time Great**  **Jaren Jackson Jr** is a **Future Star**  **Trae Young** is a **Playoff Stud**  mo bamba  **Wendell Carter** is **So Talented**
You think the Warriors regret drafting Wiseman after 1 season? Delusional. Mobley is a beast he’s like Deandre Ayton if he could hit 3s more regularly
"Watching these conference finals, the Kyrie Irving trade was actually a good return for the Cavs. Jae Crowder is a championship level role player as seen by him starting in back to back finals on different teams. They got to take a flyer on Isaiah Thomas, but most importantly they got an unprotected pick in the 2018 draft that included Deandre Ayton (1), Luka Doncic (3), and Trae Young (5). This was a brillaint gambit by the Cavs GM, as not only could they get one of these franchise altering players, but it could have also convinced LeBron to stay if they got someone that could lead a team to the finals like Trae Young or Deandre Ayton."
"&gt;with a guy like deandre ayton proving the value of a versatile big  DA is a great player, but he didn't prove this value. I think AD and Adebayo can probably take more credit for that"
"i think it’s his athleticism and mobility with his ability to guard the rim and perimeter really really well for a big man. with a guy like deandre ayton proving the value of a versatile big that can play well against any type of roster, a guy like mobley who seems even quicker on his feet with a similar level of skill is now really highly sought after"
"That's his role. He gives up a lot of offensive stats to everyone else on the roster, because that's what he's been asked to do. To his credit, he has embraced and excelled in that role.  When you have shooters like Crowder, CP3, Booker, Bridges, and the Cams, you end up with a lot of kick-outs when he has the ball in the paint, and the Suns *looove* to have a second pass (*e.g.*, Ayton to CP3 to Bridges) on the kick-out, so he doesn't get the assist for those.  &gt;Ayton has bought into his role as the guy who finishes in the paint, sets good screens, hits the offensive glass, close out stops with rebounds, communicates and defends well on the other end. There’s an occasional mid-range jumper peppered in every now and then, but the Suns have simplified DA’s role, asking him to take something of a backseat on offense compared to other first-overall picks while focusing on maximizing what they need from him to succeed.   &gt;   &gt;\- [https://fansided.com/2021/06/23/suns-valley-oop-culmination-monty-williams-impact-deandre-ayton-growth/](https://fansided.com/2021/06/23/suns-valley-oop-culmination-monty-williams-impact-deandre-ayton-growth/)"
Exhibit A: Deandre Ayton
"Ok? That doesn’t change the fact that DeAndre Jordan was extremely limited offensively in the type of bucket he could get, compared to Ayton. What are you on about."
"Yes, but I've seen enough from the first two games to predict Suns in 4-5. Clippers have no answer for DeAndre Ayton, and I don't think Ty Lue can make an adjustment to stop him.   Also if we're being honest, the Clippers are an outmatched team that have just played extremely well considering the circumstances, but there is a ceiling for this group and they're just hitting it. They deserve a lot of respect for their performance this playoffs, but it's the end of the road."
Oden (when healthy) is such a great comparison to Ayton  Deandre is such a beast
Ayton in his skillset and the type of shots he takes is closer to a prime DeAndre Jordan than to KAT or Jokic lol.
"The Suns had to endure a tough past decade ever since Nash and Amare and that core left. They had one semi-good year in 2013-14 where they nearly made the playoffs, but overall they have been woefully mismanaged. But now they have a good coach in Monty Williams, a former superstar in the Point God, CP3, a superstar in Devin Booker, a young and upcoming star in DeAndre Ayton and they are now in the Conference final, 2 wins away from the finals. A Suns Bucks finals is ripe with storylines, and First Take is more interested in Lebron switching his jersey number. This is actually great for parity and the NBA as a whole. Either Giannis, CP3, PG or Trae will win their first championship and it will be great. It just shows that every year manufactured super teams running through the playoffs isnt the best thing for the league. Also fans are back in the stands, and in the Suns and Bucks case, they have phenomenal fans."
"I'll feed you a few:  \- ""Cam Payne was playing in China two years ago, and he's worked his way toward being a starting-caliber player.""  \- ""Deandre Ayton was overshadowed his first years in the league, hit with a 25 game drug suspension, but has proven himself a premier center""  \- ""Booker's a young star that refused to leave Phoenix to take KD's 'hardest road' and is becoming legendary for Kobe""  \- ""Monty Williams survived personal tragedy and trauma to help Phoenix back to prominence""  shit, dude, that was just off the top of my head."
"Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton"
are we pretending that wiseman wasn't projected that high the whole time?  Also the same stuff was said about Deandre Ayton and look how that's going.
"The article actually talks about that in detail:   &gt; In a vacuum, and with the benefit of hindsight, no one would take Trae Young or Deandre Ayton over Luka, but basketball teams are the furthest thing from a vacuum. Everything and everyone has to fit together. The whole point of building through the draft is to create synergy among a group of young players who become better than the sum of their parts. That’s even more important for a small-market team like Detroit that can’t count on attracting elite free agents."
"I think he's turning it around. I definitely understand and share in the skepticism to a degree just based on his track record, but I think he's finally got a talented group that he A) feels is profitable, and B) he feels connected to.  The guy LOVES Deandre Ayton. He's a homegrown talent and the franchise's first and only number one draft pick. You can tell from the photos and videos of him on the team jet wearing DA's chains and goofing around with him that he and DA get along swimmingly. And Sarver himself was the person pushing for the Mikal trade on draft night, so he's obviously a big fan of him and his game. And then Booker is Booker. That's the money making star of the squad and only bright spot the team had for years.  Especially with this deep push after being trash for so long and having his name and reputation dragged through the mud, being called the worst owner in the league on par with Dolan, I can't see Sarver pulling the rug out from under us and not paying the core we have. At least, not yet anyway."
"&gt; Jaylen Brown  &gt; Bam Adebayo  &gt; Klay Thompson  &gt; DeAndre Ayton  &gt; Ja Morant  All of these guys are very good defenders outside of Morant, but his offense more than makes up for it.  Look dude you got shown up and proven wrong, just take the L and say thanks for the education. Idk why that's so hard on this sub ha"
"Jordan passed to Kerr from the wing on a designed play to get things moving first. Devin booker passed off Jae Crowder(who you 100% don’t want taking that shot) who then turned in to Mikal Bridges. Who has been anything but good shooting the ball from 3 lately.   I’m not saying he shouldn’t have passed the ball. I’m saying more should’ve been done previous to that. Deandre Ayton and Cam Johnson(who actually had the hotter shooting hand) go far side as booker comes to collect the ball. He slowly dribbles up, double teamed roughly 30 feet from the hoop. He flips the pass to Jae crowder the inbounded. Who then kicks a pass to the corner to a guy who’s been ice cold for the series and last 5 games.    You compare it to jordan and Kerr. But that was a designed play with lots of movement going on. There was absolutely zero movement on this one. And the suns got lucky that somehow the shorter guy going for the rebound knocked it out of bounds. Because if it goes off Ayton, that’s game, or if Ayton cleanly gets it where he’s at, he would’ve had less than two seconds to gather and put it back up.   But I think you missed my point. It’s not that he passed. Every legend has a big time game winning assist. But it’s that there was nothing smooth about that play. And booker didn’t even pass it to bridges anyways. Booker kicked it to Jae Crowder, the last man you want shooting when you absolutely need a bucket."
"Couple things. Bridges might’ve been a 43% shooter from 3 in the regular season, but he has been a 35% 3pt shooter in the playoffs. And over the last 5 games, going into that shot, he was actually 26% from 3.   Also you think it was drawn up that way? Nobody moved. The moment booker got the ball. Zero movement.  And if he drew it up that way, why was there two guys like 8 feet away from each other on the same side?  Not buying it. I’m not against the pass. But get something better. It was poorly designed, nobody moved on the play. Booker also gave the ball up a good 5 feet from behind the arc. At least try to create something. But they didn’t. They let him give it up way to early and got bailed out but Deandre Ayton having a monster game.   I know people will go at all costs to defend things like this. But it’s ok to admit it. Coaches make mistakes in games. No coach has ever coached a perfect game. He made up for it by drawing up the baseline out play. It’s cool."
Deandre* Ayton.

NUMBER ONE PICK DEANDRE AYTON
"Here you go my dude- straight from the NBA Officials just so you're satisfied:  ""Per NBA rule, an offensive player can touch the ball in the cylinder during a throw in."".... like we've been saying..  Official Report from NBA Officials for tonight: [https://official.nba.com/pool-report-on-the-review-of-the-out-of-bounds-play-with-9-3-seconds-left-in-the-fourth-quarter-and-the-final-field-goal-made-by-deandre-ayton-in-tonights-la-clippers-at-phoenix-suns-game/](https://official.nba.com/pool-report-on-the-review-of-the-out-of-bounds-play-with-9-3-seconds-left-in-the-fourth-quarter-and-the-final-field-goal-made-by-deandre-ayton-in-tonights-la-clippers-at-phoenix-suns-game/)"
"I get the CP3 narrative, but he wasn’t the guy who changed everything about the team and the organization, he was the perfect final piece.  The Bubble Suns weren’t a fluke. If Ayton hadn’t missed 30 games for injury and his drug fuckup, the Suns would have been in the playoffs.  Monty Williams is an excellent coach and leader. James Jones is a hell of a GM. Robert Sarver didn’t fuck it up yet. Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton are a rock solid foundation.  Chris Paul is an incredible player and an incredible leader. He deserves a ton of credit. But he alone didn’t change a “trash organization.” He was the right guy for the right time."
DeAndre Ayton is really turning a corner since the beginning of the playoffs. It is great to see.
"from tonight's head ref in the official pool report post-game  &gt;FOSTER: “Per NBA rule, an offensive player can touch the ball in the cylinder during a throw in.  In this case, Ayton controlled the ball, completed the basket, and we timed it at the replay center to make sure it was less than 0.9 and that act of him touching the ball and clearing the net only took 0.2”  you're wrong. it's been called this way in the past, the announcers pointed it out during the play, the refs confirmed this on review, the refs confirmed and clarified postgame. sorry.  https://official.nba.com/pool-report-on-the-review-of-the-out-of-bounds-play-with-9-3-seconds-left-in-the-fourth-quarter-and-the-final-field-goal-made-by-deandre-ayton-in-tonights-la-clippers-at-phoenix-suns-game/"

DeAndre Ayton had a great game and is a great young talent.  You're still wrong and you're still the only person who doesn't seem to know it.  The fact that you think this is some kind of gotcha is hilarious.
"I think Deandre has a higher ceiling, plus he's taller and stronger. If I'm building a team I want my centers to be tall.   As for the 2nd question, I'm taking Trae, unless I already have a ball-dominant player like Booker, then I'll take Ayton"
"Deandre Ayton went from one of the most low key number one picks of all time to being the biggest standout from his draft class in the playoffs. He is absolutely holding us down on both ends, this was one of the most insane endings I’ve ever seen. Just perfectly executed"

My answer is the same as it was last year: Deandre Ayton
DeAndre Ayton is a top 3 Center in the league
"Ayton is the best. He is tall, funny, good looking. Everything you could ever want to be in life. He’s good at video games, he’s got great style. Really love certain aspects of his game. I think he has a chance to be an all-time great. When he flexes at the crowd he looks so chiseled. His body is flowing with sharp muscles, finely toned and ready to unleash havoc. He kinda reminds me of a younger version of myself. I used to work out a lot and look in the mirror and think about how chiseled my body was. I was finally happy. I am so happy that we have Ayton in Phoenix. My old life and body will live inside Deandre Ayton."

@elitetakes  Here’s his breakdown of the DeAndre Ayton alley oop from a couple weeks ago: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMdCR4h89/
"Personally i would prefer for a dominant big PF/C, who doesn't stretch but lives and dies by the paint, to cover up for our paint presence and create space for the jay's outside (We got Horford back but dunno if his roleplayer stats and experience will be enough).   Also, in the modern star driven basketball, a point guard is practically kinda not that important since [insert_star_name_here] will most of the times get the ball and 1) either take it up on himself to finish the attack or 2) pass -&gt; pass -&gt; ... -&gt; pass till someone is open to shoot. Smart will be a good choice for the first squad as a unit, not a star, not a scrub, has chemistry with the team and won't fuck up the hierarchy on FGA's and passes. Also more than likely he will perform better that what he had till now, since psychologically that would be the equivalent of a promotion, psuhing someone to become sth more than what he already is. After that, get a backup PG like George Hil, who has experience and 3PT pressence, and we are stacked.  Now as for the big man, someone like Deandre Ayton, Miles Turner or a more developed James Wiseman, would be pretty nice. Another hard option to get would be Zion, who however i doubt how much use he can have on halfcourt basketball."
Deandre Ayton is good odds
Honorable mention to DeAndre Ayton
"PG Clippers was running a backup center against Deandre Ayton and Rudy Gobert. If we only take out Kawhi from the Clippers and Giannis from the Bucks, I think it’s a pretty even match up with maybe Bucks taking the edge because of Jrue."
"suns look fucken scary, deandre ayton scares me as a bucks fan"
DeAndre Ayton can be an MVP. He has all the tools.
Deandre Ayton has forced his way into the chat.
"Cause this sub is just dumb as rocks. Calling it now, during the finals the Bucks are going to lose a game, there will be chants of ""Devin Booker top 5 player in the NBA"", ""Chris Paul best PG to ever play the game"", ""Budenholzer is a garbage coach"", then the Bucks will win a game and everyone will forget they said that and then say ""Middleton is the most underrated player in the NBA"", ""Giannis should have won MVP this year"", ""Brook Lopez is better than DeAndre Ayton"". All in all, a bunch of stupid moronic opinions depending on who won yesterday."
"Half the times people complain about ""mistakes"" Bud's making, it's about games where guys we expect to take open shots take them and miss them.  Then when the players are actually making the open shots they're supposed to take, everyone pretends Bud had nothing to do with it and it's all on the players.  The first half of this game, where Middleton couldn't shoot (or hold on to the ball), along with just about everyone else going cold, the game thread was filled with people acting like it was all Bud being shitty.  Then Middleton and everyone else start nailing practically every open shot they get, and those comments disappear.... but still, all the credit to the players, and zero for the coach.  The truth is, the vast majority of people on here have almost no clue what actually goes into coaching in the NBA (including myself), because the only things we get to hear from the coaches are their coach-speak interviews, and the portions of their huddles that don't actually give away their gameplan or plays (because they can't show those parts, in case the other team would have people watching and adjusting their plans based on getting to hear what's going on in the huddle.)  Which also just ends up being cliche coach-speak about ""working harder"" and ""we gotta get back on defense, guys!""  The Deandre Ayton game-winning lob was fun to see, both for the play itself, and because after it was over, we got to actually see Monty Williams specifically calling that play and coaching up Ayton to view the play as being as simple as it is, and not let the pressure/anxiety of the moment get to him.  We almost never get to see those moments from coaches, because we're stuck with only hearing them talk in cliches."
"This year in the regular season jrue was the primary defender on Paul and Middleton on Booker.  What's interesting though w/ Giannis is that even though he didn't primarily guard Ayton, Ayton defending him more than any other bucks player holding him to 41.7% shooting (10 of 24)...but he fouled him a ton including 7 shooting fouls in just 2 games.  If Ayton gets in foul trouble the Suns can be in a real world of hurt.  That said, Deandre has been better at fouling in the playoffs, and the refs seem to let more contact go which helps."
Chris Paul got to the finals with Booker and Ayton but not DeAndre Jordan and Blake.  That's all you need to know about Blake.
AND even if he does play he's got Deandre Ayton to worry about.
"Fair enough! He hasn’t really beaten any team I really like, so maybe I’ll change my mind.   Also, Deandre Ayton makes him more likable"
i was literally at the brewers-cubbies game the night giannis got hurt. milwuakee is a fine city with fine people and ESPN is trash.  new idea. Giannis and Deandre Ayton vs SAS and Kendrick Perkins in a steel cage.
Deandre Ayton has done this like 3 times this playoffs and it amazes me every time
"Dunno man, DeAndre Ayton is pretty good."
Starring Robert Downey Jr as Deandre Ayton
Deandre Ayton
DeAndre Ayton Bout to Feast.
Predicting Chet Holmgren and not Deandre Ayton. Woof.
&gt;Dont tell anybody but the Thunder couldve been close to this years Suns if they had made win now moves instead of tearing it all down  Yeah if they gave us Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton maybe  You seriously think that 2020 OKC team was going anywhere?  We play in Oklahoma City. We didn't get free agents even with Russ and KD when we were WCF bound every year  Our only chance at winning is to draft our stars and trade for a finishing piece to put us over the top  I don't get why that's so hard for people to understand
"Hopefully you guys get some fans who actually knew who the fuck DeAndre Ayton was before this year. I lived in AZ for 20 years, I know a lot of people there now and half the people in your arena hadn’t watched a game since the Nash era (if that) and are out here screaming Suns in 4 all day long. Paul will be done soon, Booker will go somewhere fun, maybe you can overpay Ayton and get Wiggins to come compete for the 10th seed."
Deandre Ayton IMO
"I think Shai Gilchrist-Alexander benefited a lot from having Chris Paul as a mentor. Also, Cam Payne, Devin Booker, and DeAndre Ayton."
The Phoenix Suns had the first pick. Deandre Ayton was from Arizona and playing college basketball for the Arizona Wildcats. Plus he was projected as the best player in the NCAA  I don’t think the Suns regret passing on Doncic even if he’s better. A major part of their playoff success is based around Ayton
" * Coach Nate McMillan leaves for House Hawks and is on the brink of being eliminated from the Eastern Finals.  * House Suns wins the West for the first time since 1993.  * New fevers spread across the west.  The Reggie Jackson fever and the Deandre Ayton fever.  Khwai fever hasn't been cured.  * House pistons win the Lottery.   * The blazers house chapter:   Blazers obtain Norman Powell at the cost of Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr.  House Blazers gets eliminated and Coach Stotts gets banished after a long tenure.  Chauncey Billups of house Clippers takes Stotts place as a controversial hire.   Zach Collins reinjured his ankle and is still unable to contribute to the team.  Teams are in belief that Blazers might not be far away from blowing up and are sending messengers.  House Blazers are getting messages from house 76ers, and house Celtics about blowing up the team (Dame, CJ, Norman Powell)."
Muh Suns GOAT team!!!  Deandre “Wilt Chamberlain” Ayton!!!   Suns DESTROYED Prime LeBron James and Anthony Davis  Just summarizing what you sound like.
"I think there's a big IF. ""IF Deandre Ayton continues to develop into a fast big with finesse and good defense and consistent scoring"" or something. I guess I just saw it as discussion. I don't think he's anywhere near a guaranteed future hall of famer or whatever."
Why am I the only person that thinks Deandre Ayton looks like a child with a beard? I don’t see the resemblance to him looking like an old person at all.
Rudy Gobert wishes he could be as good as DeAndre Ayton
"First off, I feel like I need to clarify overall that my initial point is that they both have intangible benefits attached to them to a level that you see few other players in their sport do.   I am not making a direct Tom and Chris comparison. Not sure  NOW, that being said, let's go:  \&gt; That's ignoring that the Suns in the bubble went 8-0 against their opponents,  Definitely not ignoring that?  \&gt; This team was already considered to be playoff contenders before adding Chris Paul  You're correct - they were like +4-5000 for the title (9th best in West) and had an o/u of 38.5 wins (7th in the west) before the season.   Those odds were *after they added* Chris Paul, though. So they were just kind of playoff contenders *after* adding him as well.  \&gt; it's not like he single handedly turned the franchise around.   I'm also not making that argument.  \&gt; Booker and Ayton were balling since the bubble started.  We were all there for the bubble, and I think people reacted appropriately given the Vegas odds above.  We're talking about being 1 game back of *having the best record in the entire league.*   Ayton has had a fucking incredible playoffs, which is great, but [he's redirecting it](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/27/ayton-on-chris-paul-he-was-the-best-thing-that-happened-to-my-career/) all to Chris, [who is hyping him up](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10006574-suns-chris-paul-on-deandre-ayton-contract-hes-gonna-get-him-a-bag-this-summer).   Him and Book are great young players that also [Facetime CP3 like he's their Dad](https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/clippers-suns-devin-booker-deandre-ayton-facetime-chris-paul-after-game-1-win) after games.   My point with Chris is, is he worth what the Knicks are probably going to pay him on the court? Hell no.  But there are very, very few guys in the NBA who are to the point of where you can look at their value beyond just their on floor production and Chris is one of them.  Worth the money? I don't know. But it was a fun intellectual exercise.   \-----------------  I'm not comparing him directly to Tom. It sucks people think I am, and I have a full comment about him elsewhere that spurred the Chris point that I can't find right now, but whatever.   Really wish I could find the comment as it obviously generates some great discussion!"

"He was absolutely garbage at drafting. TJ Warren, Devin Booker &amp; DeAndre Ayton are the only ones he hit on  Len is very meh for a top-5 pick, but tbh the 2013 draft was a shitshow for most of the lottery anyway.  Then he drafted Dragan Bender with the 4th pick in 2016, as if that wasn't enough went and took Papagiannis &amp; Labissiere as well. So thats 3 useless 7-foot bums in 1 draft. He then packaged Bogdanovic/Papagiannis/Labissiere for Chriss  Blew top another top-5 pick in 2017, this time for Josh Jackson who was the prototypical uber-athletic knucklehead wing. Jackson lasted only 2 years before he was dumped to Memphis  And I'm pretty sure the only good trades he ever made was trading Scola for Gerald Green (who was a valuable part of that 48-win team in 2014) &amp; trading Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges"
"Everyone is pretty much saying Dwight and I agree.  I just want to add something in light of the effectiveness of small ball this playoffs and recognising that a lot of people on here probably didn't see prime Dwight.   Small ball only works when the bigs cannot punish the smaller players guarding them. It's why Rudy was so ineffective against the Clippers, and why Ayton has been dominating. The former cannot punish smaller guys, and the latter can.  I just want it known that when people say Dwight had no post-moves they don't mean he couldn't score in the post. Yes, it wasn't fancy but he was still more skilled in the post than most big men today. This man dominated inside. If he got deep position it was over. If he got a smaller guy on him it was over. It bothers me that a lot of newer fans seem to think he played like Clint Capela or DeAndre Jordan.   He probably should have played more PnR in his prime (blame Shaq for that one), but he was much better in the post before back surgery as well."
"That LiAngelo turned out to be the best of the ball brothers.  That Draymond Green would be the head coach of a LeBron James led team.  That Anthony Davis never missed another game due to injury.   That Marvin Bagley ended up being a better player than Luka, Trae and DeAndre Ayton."
"I make my decisions and opinions based on information that I have or is readily available. Not hearsay, rumors, speculations, or even players. Some of them don't even know what they're taking, whether it's a PED or not. For example Hedo Turkolu, DeAndre Ayton. It's possible that Giannis could be on something, but his physcial transformstion and the years it took to fill his frame doesn't warrant any red flags. You speak as though it's a known fact"
"Suspension and dude should be put on probation -- any further flagrant and/or dangerous plays, should result in automatic suspension, even for a full season.  The foul on Deandre Ayton that was called a common foul was a complete joke. This guy plays with intensity that puts players in danger. Also, Fuck Pat Bev."
Deandre Ayton had to sit 25 games for traces of marijuana... from the offseason. 15 at least for that ugly move by Beverly.
Deandre Ayton got 25 games for PED’s two seasons ago too. After he broke Marvin Bagley’s thumb
"Ok, so how about this.  And I'm going to post the stat from before last night's game because it's the one I have available.  Deandre Ayton is on pace to have the highest field goal percentage (70.9%) for any player in NBA playoffs history for a single playoffs.  This would beat the previous record held by James Worthy in 1985 by almost 8%, Worthy shot 62.2%.  Prior to last night's game Ayton could miss 20 shots in a row and still hold the record for highest field goal percentage.  He shot 8-10 in last night's game.  [Source](https://twitter.com/EliasSports/status/1409551476653973506)"
deandre ayton is in the finals and I'm supposed to believe the league cares about substance use
"There are several other QBs that are better statistically and talent wise *right now* but Tom has real intangible value despite being a worse on the field player.  It matters that when he shows up you either get your shit together and believe you’re going to win the super bowl or you can literally get the fuck off of his team   Kawhi Leonard is *significantly better at basketball* at this point in time but his own value is his statistics (which are very [very] important and very [very] good).  If you only look at Chris Paul’s statistics (contract aside) then you are not bringing his intangible value into the equation,  He took what was supposed to be an overwhelmingly shitty OKC team to the brink of beating the Rockets and every player gave him the credit.  He’s taking a team that just missed the bubble last year to the finals this year and [every player is giving him credit](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/deandre-ayton-says-chris-paul-is-the-best-thing-that-happened-to-my-career/).  Yes - I know Chris Paul is not *as good as Kawhi Leonard at the moment at the game of basketball* and yes I know Chris Paul *isn’t Tom Brady*"
"&gt;Simmons is top 5 in assists over the last 3 years and him and Embiid are the #1 duo for assists, but yeah Simmons isn’t an elite playmaker, lol. Playmaking is literally his best offensive trait, a dude who is a multiple time allstar and was 3rd team all nba last year. So by your logic, because he can’t shoot... he isn’t a playmaker? That’s not how that works, not at all. Embiid was a horrible example.   He's not because you keep referring to counting stats and accolades and not how their offence operates. They have consistently gotten by on their defence and not offence (this year they were 12th in offencive rating despite being the #1 seed). They failed each year to advance in the playoffs because Simmons can't breakdown the defence in the halfcourt setting.   &gt;Booker is a better playmaker than Murray, but Murray is still a far better playmaker than most players in the NBA. So again, to say Ayton is only good because he plays next to Booker is just dumb as shit.   Okay? What is the argument here?    &gt;Yep, because I’m a fan of him. I do enjoy defending one of my favorite players against people who clearly have no idea what they’re talking about. Quite a bit different than having a hate boner for a player to the degree you do. I don’t even think Ayton is top 3, but he’s 4th and undeniably top 5 by age 22. Bro... you think... Deandre Jordan took less “spoonfed and created-for-him” shots... because he was a bad free throw shooter? If they were truly spoonfed shots, why the fuck wouldn’t he be shooting them, regardless of how he shoots at the line??????? There is a massive dissonance here that is clear as day in numerous ways, yet you chose to dig yourself deeper.   Because teams would rather hack DJ than hack Ayton who is a better FT shooter? What is your logic here.   &gt;Telling me about NBA centers is hilarious when you clearly don’t know the basics of the center position, what skills are useful, and what skills are extra. I’ve watched no less than 50 hakeem games in my life, I’d recommend you go watch Hakeem when he was at the university of Houston (age 21). Ayton is way, way closer to that than he is Deandre Jordan... especially considering the fact that he’s already better than Jordan was at his peak. Calling the player who is having the most efficient postseason run in NBA history while doing it on 16 ppg at age 22 subpar offensively is so brain dead it hurts. Like next level stupid, one of the worst basketball takes I’ve ever heard. I pray I remember these comments just so I can relentlessly expose you in years to come.  And how is he closer? He can't fadeaway, he has trouble catching passes that aren't lobs and his footwork is weak."
"**Deandre Ayton**  KAT is always framed as this offensive monster that’s trapped on a bad Timberwolves team.   Here’s what he did in the playoffs:  15.2/13.4 on 54 TS% with 0.1 DWS(81st in the league)   He was out scored by both Butler and Wiggins. Alright scoring and terrible defense   Sure, KAT gets a lot of buckets during the regular season on lottery teams, but push come to shove I want a center who understands his role and can play on a winning team.   **Here’s Ayton’s stats this playoffs:**  16.2/11.8 on 70 TS% with 1.1 DWS(3rd in the league)"
"Bruh, I read this and I was like ""eh? Wtfm8? Ayton been drafted by Phoenix though?"" Literally never even crossed my mind for like a full minute that there might be other people in the world named DeAndre rofl"
"You know who has the highest true shooting of all time? DeAndre Jordan. MPJ's volume and efficiency coming from all levels is just far more impressive and far more valuable than what Ayton is doing despite similar numbers. Ayton had a good playoff run (apart from the finals where he was very very bad), but looking at the current NBA and looking at both their career trajectories there's absolutely no way I'm taking a jack of all trades center over an athletic super efficient 3 level scorer"
DeAndre Ayton will be getting a max contract. They've been in talks and may have stalled. He'll get his money though.
Well ideally you don’t want to have Deandre Ayton making max contract money.
So did deandre ayton. 22 but looks 40
"Don't care what ID says, DeAndre Ayton looks like he's 40."
I got a feeling player A is Deandre Ayton.
Player A must be Deandre Ayton…let me know after the poll please. Thank you for the questions! I vote A
Player A is pretty clearly DeAndre Ayton right? Cant figure out who B is
&gt;!Deandre Ayton!&lt;
"&gt; This includes MANY #1 picks.   I'd go beyond that. It includes almost all #1 picks in recent history:  * 2013 - Anthony Bennett was never the priority over Kyrie, traded soon after * 2014 - Andrew Wiggins was immediately traded, and after Wiggins' first year, KAT was the priority * 2015 - KAT, an exception * 2016 - Ben Simmons, whose team has at least clearly tried to make him guy 1B and has consistently campaigned for him to win awards and tried to get him to step up and do more so he CAN be the priority * 2017 - Markelle Fultz, everyone knows this one * 2018 - Deandre Ayton, obviously behind Booker always * 2019 - Zion, duh * 2020 - Anthony Edwards, behind KAT  So, 8 #1 picks, only 2 of whom were the priority on their teams"
"&gt;“What No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?” said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged.  DeAndre Ayton. What a silly question."
"Man, it’s so great the center position has returned to a point where we can have these discussions. There were years when Deandre Jordan and Tyson Chandler were the best bigs in the game and it would be a guard driven league for years to come. Basketball, like everything is cyclical. It’s like that period in the NFL when there were no great bell cow RBs and people just assumed there never would be again. Then you get LeVeon, Elliott and a slough of other dudes.   Personally, the center position is my favorite and Joker is my favorite player for really redefining the position. He’s doing things that have not really ever been done at the position. He can pass and handle, while being a huge brute that can play with his back to the basket. It is impossible to double team Joker. The Suns were able to guard him very capably with basically just Ayton and that really slowed down the Nuggets who depend on getting great looks off Jokic’s superior passing.  Meanwhile, Embiid is a marvel. The fact he continues to improve while collecting injuries like baseball cards is nuts and probably unsustainable. That said, when he is healthy, I don’t think there is a more unstoppable low post force. As a Heat fan, I can say we really struggle with Embiid, but honestly with Ben present, there are ways to defend the Sixers that wouldn’t exist if you had a more traditional point. He’s just so big and powerful and he can defend his position and the paint at an elite level. He’s just a monster and he can still stretch the floor to keep people honest.   I’m going to say Joker just because I love his game so much. He, like the best point guards and distributors, makes everyone around him a better basketball player. You just have to be able to play off-ball with Joker because he is such an amazing passer. I can’t wait to see Embiid with a traditional point guard, because I don’t think he will be able to be hammered so hard in the paint. There could potentially be someone at the top of the key willing to stretch the floor and punish teams for sinking down on him. That is something he has never really had unless Ben is off the court and it will be fun to watch.   That said, I would say Embiid is a more physically imposing player and a highly skilled big, but I think Joker does more in terms of contributing to the wins his team accumulates. It’s close in that regard, but they are also really different players completely. I would say, that the only player that is maybe a better offensive player in the entire league is Harden or Durant, but Harden can’t post all five guys on the court up effectively and Durant can’t pass as well as Joker. Also, neither of those two guys are 7-feet tall and 300ish pounds. Joker is as effective getting offensive rebounds down low as he is leading a fast break. He’s absolutely nuts and just a different kind of dude.   The Denver Nuggets offense reminds me of a solar system where Jokic is the Sun and everyone just runs around him coming off screens and all sorts of things and the Sun is just shooting it’s light rays to the depths of the solar system, finding anything that can be touched by its rays. It’s a weird metaphor I guess, but it’s why I love watching him. He’s like 300-pound Steve Nash."
"I think this is the tough thing thing for Gobert. In order for him to be able to defend the perimeter and slide around to cover as help defense I think he *needs* to be fairly light as a genuine 7 footer. When you get that tall your side to side agility suffers and you need to be lighter to compensate. But when he’s light he can’t punish shorter players inside so its a bit of a tricky situation for him. I think the fix is to be heavy, bang inside and forget about perimeter d ala deandre ayton. But easier said than done given goberts body type and lack of finishing touch"
"Ball Handler: Doncic   ($5) 1 or 1A best combination of youth and skill in the list. Age 22. This lineup would give him the ability to run any set he wants. The rest of the team would allow his defense weaknesses to be covered up (assuming the $1 guy buys in). If you're into traditional positions, he'd be PG.  Wings   Gary Trent Jr ($1)  Excellent shooter who would probably get a lot of room to shoot thanks to Tatum and Doncic. Has defensive skills - if he can be convinced to channel them.  On this team, likely to feast on all the open shots that Doncic/Tatum/Ayton will be providing.  Age 22. Traditional position: SG  Mikal Bridges ($2) All around glue guy.  Age 25.  Does multiple things well, could serve as clean-up both offensively and defensively, setting screens or providing help. Traditional set position: SF  Jayson Tatum ($4) 1 or 1a best combination of youth or skill. The best all-around player in this lineup. Age 23. Traditional position: PF  Big  Deandre Ayton ($3) Best young big on this list. Age 23. Can play in and out, switchable all around. Traditional position: C  Defensively switchable enough to help protect Doncic, offensively could pull off a lot of multiple sets with Doncic and Tatum capable of handling the ball as faciliator. Imagine the pick and roll in different combinations with these guys.  And probably most significantly, the youth of this team gives it both a high floor and a really high ceiling."
"Lonzo Ball $1  Jayson Tatum $4  Giannis $5  Myles Turner $2  DeAndre Ayton $3  Everyone is a competent defender especially in the frontcourt. All of them are in their prime or entering it, 3pt shooting might be iffy but the spacing should be alright. Giannis would be running point and Lonzo would be a spot up shooter and making plays on the break like Mavs Jason Kidd."
PG - Luka Doncic $5  SG - Gary Trent Jr. $1  SF - Giannis $5  PF - Robert Covington $1  C - Deandre Ayton $3
Lonzo Ball  Devin Booker  Mikal Bridges   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Deandre Ayton
"* Regular season: Rudy Gobert, offense-altering defensive presence who can make virtually any team into a top five defense.  * Postseason: Deandre Ayton, he's more able offensively than Gobert and giving the biggest, strongest guy on the floor the ball and letting him power his way to a bucket is a valuable weapon when your offense goes stagnant. Plus, while not on Gobert's level defensively, Ayton is still a very good defender and a bit more mobile/versatile and better 1v1; Gobert is a great player over a long regular season, and can be a great playoff performer (he dominated the Grizzlies, for example) but teams which stretch the floor but can also drive/penetrate (like the Harden Rockets and last year's Clippers) can really exploit his weaknesses."
"He reminds me a ton of Deandre Ayton with maybe a better midrange jumper, we’ll see how he does in Memphis  My question is, though, are old-fashioned rim running bigs worth top 5 picks nowadays?"
Brook Lopez and Deandre Ayton started at the 5 for the teams in the Finals what are you talking about
DeAndre Ayton
"Ik this is not a whole team, but it is worth noting Deandre Ayton was building a defensive reputation in the playoffs and Giannis destroyed him"
You’ve literally been a lottery team for the last 10 years and for the next 5 you’ll peak in the second round. It’s a shame Giannis had to destroy your broke franchise cause y’all ain’t getting a ring anytime soon with 50 year old Chris Paul and deandre “Jordan” Ayton
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
"If CP3 is healthy and plays 60+ games, Deandre Ayton won’t make it past 16 ppg."
Deandre Ayton is overrated. He does nothing better than an average center from 2010.
"Deandre Ayton will be the best ""winning"" player from the 2018 draft.  His all around game and super low ego is exactly what is needed to form a winning core that vets and other stars want to be a part of."
DeAndre Ayton for sure he’s so cool
"If he continues his playoff performances, Deandre Ayton."
Deandre Ayton in shambles
"Plenty of players respect Jokic. DeAndre Ayton did, LeBron did.   PER penalizes for missed shots, turnovers, personal fouls. He was also the highest in the WS (win share) stat that season which isn't something you can just ""stuff"". You have to play winning basketball for that to happen.  Here's the rest of the players for each year for win shares: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws_yearly.html  The last time he would have been beat was in 2015-2016 which was Curry having an all time great season."
THAT’S FIRST OVERALL PICK DEANDRE AYTON TO YOU  My lord what a beautiful set play
4 lead changes in 30 seconds. I believe Deandre Ayton slammed down the alley pop with .7 seconds left to win the game.
I really really like DeAndre Ayton.
MY GOD!!!! DEANDRE AYTON!!!!
I want to kiss Deandre Ayton on the mouth
Because DeAndre Ayton is an athletic freak and not many centers can do that LOL

DeAndre Ayton is the best player in this series and if the Suns don't get him more involved than Cam Payne it's coaching malfeasance
"Deandre Ayton has been so underrated, I'm glad people are seeing his true value now. It's hard not to root for this Sun's team with all that they went through the past few years. Good fucking shit."
DEANDRE AYTON DUUUDE
"Deandre Ayton continues to dominate this series. All around great team play despite Book’s cold streak shooting, he finished strong with that great screen."
DEANDRE AYTON
"&gt;Ball Game.  \- Deandre Ayton, probably"
I love deandre ayton so much that’s my number 1 pick
That was fucking insane. Fuck Scott Foster. Deandre Ayton is a fucking stud. That is all.
I FUCKING LOVE DEANDRE AYTON
Don't let the horrible stoppage distract you from the fact that I love DeAndre Ayton
Booker didn’t shoot well tonight but he made huge game winning plays. This guy has elevated his game so much.  Deandre Ayton is also an absolute talent and very polished on both ends of the floor.

DeAndre Ayton singlehandedly ended the Clippers small ball identity. He's built different.
"He should have Deandre Ayton pee in the cup for his next Covid test so he can pass.  *Chris Paul has been suspended for 25 games for violating the NBA's policy against Performance Enhancing Drugs.""*"
"""Agggrhgghhhhgggggh"" *flex* - DeAndre Ayton Sr."
"Players who have a chance this year that could join this list:   -  DeMarcus Cousins (LAC, 5th overall)  -  Kris Dunn (ATL, 5th overall)  -  Deandre Ayton (PHX, 1st overall)  -  Trae Young (ATL, 5th overall)  - De'Andre Hunter (ATL, 4th overall)  ---  So for this to not change, the Bucks would have to win the 2021 championship"
Scoring 20+ isn't nearly as common in college as it is in the NBA.

"Lol I love that you're calling other people biased and immature in a thread where you adamantly claim that DeAndre Ayton is a better player than Luka Doncic.  Self-awareness isn't for everyone I suppose.  And good answer to the comment itself, regarding your guarantee of the outcome of a different, 3 year old timeline involving 30 teams and hundreds of players, lmao."
Happened with Deandre Ayton too
&gt; DeAndre Ayton still not performing to 1st pick standards  Just cause he's not Luka doesn't mean he isn't worthy. This playoff run absolutely proves that he is a 1st overall pick type guy. Yes this is likely the last hoorah for CP3 but Book and Ayton is still a damn good duo
"Simmons is top 5 in assists over the last 3 years and him and Embiid are the #1 duo for assists, but yeah Simmons isn’t an elite playmaker, lol. Playmaking is literally his best offensive trait, a dude who is a multiple time allstar and was 3rd team all nba last year. So by your logic, because he can’t shoot... he isn’t a playmaker? That’s not how that works, not at all. Embiid was a horrible example.   Booker is a better playmaker than Murray, but Murray is still a far better playmaker than most players in the NBA. So again, to say Ayton is only good because he plays next to Booker is just dumb as shit.   Yep, because I’m a fan of him. I do enjoy defending one of my favorite players against people who clearly have no idea what they’re talking about. Quite a bit different than having a hate boner for a player to the degree you do. I don’t even think Ayton is top 3, but he’s 4th and undeniably top 5 by age 22. Bro... you think... Deandre Jordan took less “spoonfed and created-for-him” shots... because he was a bad free throw shooter? If they were truly spoonfed shots, why the fuck wouldn’t he be shooting them, regardless of how he shoots at the line??????? There is a massive dissonance here that is clear as day in numerous ways, yet you chose to dig yourself deeper.   Telling me about NBA centers is hilarious when you clearly don’t know the basics of the center position, what skills are useful, and what skills are extra. I’ve watched no less than 50 hakeem games in my life, I’d recommend you go watch Hakeem when he was at the university of Houston (age 21). Ayton is way, way closer to that than he is Deandre Jordan... especially considering the fact that he’s already better than Jordan was at his peak. Calling the player who is having the most efficient postseason run in NBA history while doing it on 16 ppg at age 22 subpar offensively is so brain dead it hurts. Like next level stupid, one of the worst basketball takes I’ve ever heard. I pray I remember these comments just so I can relentlessly expose you in years to come."
Deandre has Ayton of hoes
"&gt;You said elite guard. Is Simmons not an elite playmaker who is also a guard?????? This isn’t this difficult, you’re just digging deeper for no reason at all.   He's not an elite playmaker because he can't run a halfcourt offence and he can't run the p&amp;p because he can't shoot. Isn't that obvious?  &gt;Bro, the goalpost shifting is crazy. You said elite playmaking guards in reference to Booker, who is more of a traditional shooting guard than Murray is.  Because he has the size to play the 2 but Booker is a much better playmaker due to being forced to develop his playmaking because the Suns refused to pair him with a good PG for the longest while.  &gt;Yes, getting into arguments almost daily and commenting on positive takes everywhere on /new for weeks is about as clear of a hate boner as it gets. KAT fans been feeling hella insecure recently, kinda wild since Ayton fans aren’t even really bringing up KAT. He “creates” a lot of those other looks too, there is a reason he gets more looks like that than any other center in the league. Rim rolling and finding the soft spot in the defense is indeed a skill, even though you clearly don’t know that. There’s a reason he’s averaging almost double the fga of Deandre Jordan, who was arguably the greatest lob catcher of all time playing with PRIME cp3.   I mean you are here in the trenches defending your boy and you want to call me out on it? Anyone who says that Ayton isn't a top 3 C in the league is met with you people. And do you know why he averages double the FGA attempts? because DAJ was a shit FT shooter and was hacked constantly as opposed to Ayton who averages a grand total of 2 FTA.  &gt;No, I don’t think he would, and yes we actually have seen him create more shots for himself. This isn’t a hypothetical “can he,” we actually have seen it in countless real games. He literally created most of his looks his rookie year, even if they were assisted. Forcing post touches in a 0.5 offense slows down ball movement and can slow/clog-up off ball motion, which is kind of the exact opposite of the point of the 0.5 offense. And our offense is top 5 in the league and in the finals without doing that, so why do that? I know these types of nuances can be tough, but I would also think someone wouldn’t be commenting 100 times a week about a single player if they didn’t know these things.  I suggest you go and watch any of the all NBA C's play to see the difference  between them and Ayton. Your boy is closer to DAJ than he is to Hakeem and no matter how much your fanbase wants to speak it into existence his subpar offensive game is just that subpar."
"He averaged 2 more points a game on 2% worse TS? You really milking the hell out of that. You’re really, really, REALLY stretching to make points here if you think Ayton wouldn’t have preferred Teague over a washed version of one of the most notoriously selfish offensive players in NBA history.   You said elite guard. Is Simmons not an elite playmaker who is also a guard?????? This isn’t this difficult, you’re just digging deeper for no reason at all.   Bro, the goalpost shifting is crazy. You said elite playmaking guards in reference to Booker, who is more of a traditional shooting guard than Murray is.  Yes, getting into arguments almost daily and commenting on positive takes everywhere on /new for weeks is about as clear of a hate boner as it gets.

I know these types of nuances can be tough, but I would also think someone wouldn’t be commenting 100 times a week about a single player if they didn’t know these things."
I mean DeAndre Jordan and Tyson Chandler basically did nothing but catch lobs (many of those also coming from CP3) and didn't manage Ayton's efficiency during any of their playoff runs.   What Ayton is doing is incredibly impressive. The fact that his touches are coming close to the rim doesn't make them easy looks.
When he signs his max *yeah I’m Deandre Ayton and I’m getting really rich*
Lol Deandre “I got hoooooooooes” Ayton
"To be fair, Deandre Ayton doesn't rhyme with ""I got hoooooooes"". So that's a point for Bamba"
"A lot of credit to the Clippers for their overall hustle in this series. Their level of poise and execution was great, and if both teams are fully healthy, this probably goes 6-7 and the Clippers are favored.  Having said that, whenever the Suns could get out of their own way and run their normal offense instead of being shocked that the Clippers can play great defense, they got buckets every single time. Did it game 1, did it game 2 even if Book started off horribly then broke his nose, did it first half of game 4 before the Clippers (again, credit to them) rattled them with their great comeback, did it throughout game 6. They got little offensive contribution from their wings all series other than Cam and game 6 Crowder, so them having the firepower to do this is extremely encouraging for the Finals and future playoff runs. Also, Deandre fucking Ayton man. What a series for him. MVP of the Suns in the Western Conference fucking Finals, and what, a top 40 player in the league at this point?  If the Suns can be the Suns we know they are and have been all season, they're going to win their first NBA title. That's such an exciting sentence to me. When I saw the bracket I thought ""if they beat the Lakers they can make it out of the West"", but for it to actually happen is insane. I expected a 5th seed and a 2nd round run when the season started.  Thinking about what kind of champions these Suns are (and sorry for getting ahead of myself, when we know the opponent my thoughts will change instantly and become more nuanced in terms of the Suns' chances), seems like '04 Pistons or '19 Raptors. They have 3 top 40 guys, 2 top 20 guys (even if Kawhi was obviously a tier above), and two other above average starters plus a productive bench. They're winning by sheer force of being able to get productive minutes by all their lineups and their starting lineup rarely being beaten in its own right (at least when they started gaining chemistry around early February).  P.S. Shout out Marcus Morris, crazy good performance this series.  P.S. II: Torrey Craig cost 110K dollars."
