"Yes. Durant and Harden are top 5 at playing basketball, and Spencer Dinwiddie is one of the top 5 NBA players on twitter."
"It's possible that Embiid will be the only first round pick from the draft to make an All-Star team.   Good second round though: Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Dwight Powell (who was pretty good before his Achilles injury), Jordan Clarkson."
"It’s embarrassing that people think Jonathan Clay Redick would be useless on the Brooklyn Nets. He would for sure get ~20mpg in the playoffs off the bench.   There’s currently only one player on the bench that I trust to be part of the playoff rotation in Jeff Green and he’s going to get most his minutes at the 5 in the playoffs. Bruce Brown is decent, but Jonathan Clay Redick would be an upgrade.   If all it took was Spencer Dinwiddie and a second round pick... I’d do it instantly. The Brooklyn Nets need a power forward, wing or guard more than a center. The center position is overrated in 2021. Not worried at all when they have 5.7M to offer to two players (each) in the buyout market.   The Brooklyn Nets have only one open roster spot left? I didn’t know you couldn’t waive players on teams anymore...."
Spencer Dinwiddie is up there.
"huh  \&gt;Kyle Lowry is a free agent but will likely get a bigger deal, Mike Conley is too old, Goran Dragic is too old and Spencer Dinwiddie will be coming off of an ACL injury. For the price that Lonzo would cost, it is clear that he would be the best option for the Los Angeles Lakers."
Saw a user on here try to argue spencer dinwiddie is better than him
Do the Pacers want to keep Turner? We'll offer a gently used Spencer Dinwiddie and a 2077 First round pick.
"Spencer Dinwiddie has a player option next year and he's likely to go back to Brooklyn for an MLE.   No one will want him.   If the Nets want a big they will either have to give up 2nds for a bum like JaVale or they'll have to give up someone with real worth.   I'd swap Theis or Thompson for Joe Harris, but I can't see the Nets parting with him."
why do you keep trying to trade spencer dinwiddie
Spencer Dinwiddie was on JB not Joe Harris what the hell are you talking about lol
Spencer Dinwiddie
Why is spencer dinwiddie shooting 3s in quotes
I get anxiety playing against Spencer Fucking Dinwiddie
Spencer Dinwiddie
"T-this is insane...I was sorta scared of the Nets due to their insane depth, and collection of all-star caliber players, KD/Kyrie/Caris/Dinwiddie/DeAndre/Jarrett. But now? Dinwiddie is out for now, DeAndre playing like trash (compared to what I know he can do), Caris/Jarrett got traded. And the big 3 as good as they are, trust me I know how good those players are individually, they can’t guard a pick up team at the YMCA, let alone proper NBA team. At the start I wanted Caris/Spencer/Jarrett/ 2 first round picks for Harden, but now even without those? Trade looks like a major W for everyone but Brooklyn."
"Well they are also missing a 20 point scorer in Spencer Dinwiddie. Bringing a guy like him off the bench would shore up a lot of their bench issues. Their defense would likely still be ass, but they could basically always have 2 major offensive threats on the court at all times."
"If the Nets lose one more game that year the Sexton pick becomes the Doncic pick. Spencer Dinwiddie his 4 game winners that year including one against the Cavs and LeBron (it still gives me nightmares).    I would still say the Cavs initially lost that trade and are working towards equilibrium while the Celtics are forever cemented at “not a win, not a loss” but man do things change a lot if Spencer Dinwiddie just misses one of those game winners."
"The Nets have been the home for outcast misfits for years now... it's kinda our thing.   DeAngelo Russell was viewed as a rat, Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris were basically out of the league, Caris LeVert was injury plagued, hell even Jarrett Allen dropped in the draft because people thought he didnt care enough about basketball.   In a weird way, KD Harden and Kyrie are the perfect superstars for the Nets"
The nets 5th best player “spencer dinwiddie” would be the 3rd best players on the lakers.
Spencer Dinwiddie on the Pistons. Completely forgot that he played for them
"Knicks, what would y’all give for Spencer Dinwiddie? Like Austin Rivers and Nerlens Noel?"
"I quickly want to question their depth, but if healthy, they're fine. The wing defense will be the main question but a supporting cast around those main 3 of DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, and (when healthy) Spencer Dinwiddie isn't that bad. Fit wise it is a bit weird though"
"Yeah John Collins to a potential max itll be very interesting to see if Atl matches. It would create a massive payroll for an owner who's only paid the tax like twice and that was for like $2-3 mil over.   Thing with JC is he's not a 5, so playing him at a 4 its workable but it also doesnt provide as much flexibility especially if they keep DeRozan. This also might not be a bad Lauri Markkanen destination.   I dont think they want to go full on tanking. There enough of these Spencer Dinwiddie type FAs they could sign and I bet will try to to stay out of the bottom tier. I also think there is enough baseline talent here to prevent them from being a bottom feeder and theyll be able to draft more guys also. For DeRozan I bet if they offer like 3 yrs $70ish mil he would stay. Im not sure I would but that's probably what he would ask. Once LMA is gone, biggest goal is probably just finding the 5 to round things out and whether or not they believe that's Poeltl."
"Not to mention, is spencer dinwiddie on one leg really worth playing? Is that really a better option than whatever else you have on the bench? Its not like he is durant where even if he is 80 percent he is still an starter or all star level player."
Nono it was definitely for Spencer fucking Dinwiddie
"Always easier to re-sign when you have the guy in house, selling him on a vision.  Fully understand he's injured and about to be an FA--again, dipo is almost in exactly the same position, right.  If the rockets can't count on themselves to re-sign a spencer dinwiddie coming off an ACL they got way bigger issues than extracting full value of this trade."
"Spencer Dinwiddie responds to a graphic thanking him, Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, D'Angelo Russell for making the new Durant, Harden, Harden and Harden era possible."
"Nobody is trading a max level player for Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie.  Anybody actually worth the max is much better than the two of them, and anybody being overpaid that much isn’t really worth it for the Nets."
[Spencer Dinwiddie right now](https://tenor.com/view/respect-rodney-dangerfield-no-gif-5275110)
"I noticed that the NY Daily News had a headline about the ""mighty Nets"" losing Spencer Dinwiddie a short while ago. It sounds like a lot of people in NY don't like the Nets or are frustrated that they're outshining the Knicks so much."
Joe Harris is Nightwing. Deandre Jordan is Azrael. TLC is Batwing. Spencer Dinwiddie is Batgirl. And Steve Nash is Batwoman.
Yeah I don’t think he’s commonly referred to as AG enough for people to recognise him as that   No ones calling spencer dinwiddie SD
"No way Spencer Dinwiddie is coming back to the Nets - even if the Nets wanted him. Either he gets a bag or he needs to have a year to prove his worth and that’s not happening as the 4th option behind Harden, KD, and Kyrie."
DeAndre Jordan for Serge Ibaka. Spencer Dinwiddie and Kyrie Irving for Wendall Carter? Kristaps Porzingis. Jarret Allen.  I think WSC is Wendall Carter. None of this shit is realistic.
Thank you. That’s what I kind of figured. They didn’t have to give up Spencer Dinwiddie or can he not be traded due to injury.
"Let me tell you something. If the Rockets end this messy divorce with: Christian Wood, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Caris Levert, Jarret Allen, Spencer Dinwiddie and 5 picks, they would have done a damn good job.  I do not think that is the deal, but even if it ends up being Kyrie and a broken Dinwidde + STILL all those picks? WORTH IT."

"Do you think there are a large (relatively) number of people who could also be high level NBA players if things lined up?  You sometimes hear “these are the 400 best players in the world”. And no doubt, you’re all incredible.  But how many Duncan Robinson, Spencer Dinwiddie, Pat Bev, etc etc... as in: people who have the potential to be NBA players, but need a few opportunities to open up...?  Because you’re one of the best shooters in the entire NBA *right now* and your journey looks precarious in a few places."

"I have to disagree there though, I think a big problem with Kyrie is he still has an ego and he wouldn't be okay with coming off the bench even if its better for his mental health. This is a guy who left Lebron to try to carry a team, failed and then came to the nets and made incendiary comments about how KD was the only teammate he could rely on. He's also taken more shots than KD on the court when they've played together this season. All this tells me that Kyrie still believes he's the best player on the court at any time and that would make it hard for any team to convince him to accept a smaller role. I mean if he can't defer to Lebron and KD, there's no way in hell he's deferring to Caris Levert and Spencer Dinwiddie. I hope I'm wrong though because if these antics continue and he doesn't accept a smaller role he might get AI'd or Carmelo'd out the league.  And yeah Kevin Love's story was heartbreaking but hopeful, hopefully kyrie can take inspiration from it"
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"Well at least they don't have copy paste protections like some other news sites. Sorry if there are any weird formatting errors, just did a quick pass on it.  NYTimes:  The ‘Old Soul’ of the Nets Is Steering the Team in a New Direction  By Kelly Whiteside Nov. 25, 2018 Jarrett Allen stood outside a Key Food Supermarket in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn and handed 25 local children a grocery list and a calculator. Their task was to use math, and a calculator imprinted with Allen’s name and Nets jersey number, to fill their grocery carts and stay within the $100 budget he gave them.  Plenty of N.B.A. stars have their own shoe, clothing, underwear and eyewear lines — often vanity projects for oversize fashionistas. Allen is different. And not just because his name is stretched across a calculator instead of kicks.  “Math is the future,” he said.  “He’s so different from everyone usually in the N.B.A.,” said Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie, his closest friend on the team. “Everybody else is like, ‘Wow, he’s weird.’ When everyone was referencing him as weird, or just kind of different, I was like, ‘Man, that’s my guy.’ He’s extremely smart. I love having conversations with him on that level.”  In the N.B.A., one man’s weird just might be another man’s love of STEM. “It started with destroying stuff,” Allen said. “I would break things apart, then put them together. Then my dad gave us one of his super-old computers, and I’ve really been on that track since I was probably around 5.”  In high school, he built his own computer, which he still uses today. Like most 20-year-olds in the N.B.A., he loves gaming, particularly Overwatch, but he doesn’t play the ubiquitous NBA 2K. “I don’t play sports video games,” he said. “My whole life revolves around sports.”  After finishing his freshman year at Texas and declaring for the draft, N.B.A. teams had questions about his commitment. Did he love the game enough? Or did he play just because he’s tall? (He’s listed at 6-foot-11, but he’s more like 7-foot-3 with hair included.) Some N.B.A. talent evaluators would prefer their prospects have a singular interest, a life spinning on the axis of an orange ball.  Though Allen professed his love for the game during predraft interviews, he made it clear he was more than just a basketball player. The Nets saw the big picture, selected him 22nd over all in 2017, and hoped he, at center, would become the cornerstone of their rebuilding project.  Allen opened this season with back-to-back double-doubles, and added another, plus several near-misses, before sitting out two games because of an illness. In his first three games back, he averaged 17.7 points, 12.3 rebounds and nearly two blocks a game.  “He has everything you want. He’s athletic, he can run the floor, space the floor vertically, shoot, finish with both hands and protect the rim,” Dinwiddie said. “Right now, the only thing you can knock him for is not being physically imposing, but he’s only 20 years old, and all of that is going to come with time. If that’s all you’re missing in your game, you’re doing really well.”  Allen’s father, Leonard, was a standout center for San Diego State from 1981 to 1985 and held a school blocked-shot record that was broken in 2015. The Dallas Mavericks picked Leonard Allen 50th over all in the 1985 draft, but he didn’t catch on with a team. After playing in Europe, he returned home to Texas and transitioned into a career at Dell computers.  “Basketball wasn’t the main focus,” Jarrett Allen said of his childhood. “For my dad, he played his whole life. His life revolved around it. He just wanted us to be normal kids.”  Growing up in Round Rock, Tex., Allen was blissfully unaware of the intensity of elite youth basketball. “I didn’t know about that whole crazy A.A.U. scene,” he said.  Allen and his older brother Leonard played basketball in church and community rec center leagues for fun. “We were clueless about organized basketball, at least on an elite level,” said his mother, Cheryl. “We didn’t even know it existed, and I’m glad we were oblivious to that world.”  Free from the demands of travel team sports, Allen pursued other interests. “Jarrett from an early age has always had an interest and curiosity about the world around him,” Cheryl Allen said. “That is why his transition to Brooklyn has been an easy one. I’d like to think that not starting elite basketball so young helped. He was able to be a kid as long as possible before becoming consumed by it, which unfortunately happens.”  At the end of Allen’s sophomore year in high school, it became clear that college basketball might be an option. “I didn’t know the college scene was that big. I didn’t know the N.B.A. was that big,” he said.  On some nights after games at Barclays Center, Allen walks home, which usually takes 25 minutes. “It’s nice to just enjoy the night,” he said.  Nicknamed the Fro, his hairstyle isn’t some tribute to Dr. J and the A.B.A. of decades past. “I’m not trying to show it off, show that I can make it round,” Allen said. “I’m not even wearing it because it’s old school. It’s just how it is. I’m just wearing it because it’s my hair. I’ve had it for five years. I’m in too deep now.”  His hair was one of many topics that came up when he did an “Ask Me Anything” online chat on Reddit (he considers himself a Redditor) just before the season started. He was asked questions such as: “What is the coolest celebrity experience you’ve had since getting to the NBA/New York?”  Answer: “I got a free slice of cake for dessert at a restaurant one time.”  And: “How do you achieve that amazing Afro? How much time do you spend on it a day?” Answer: “45 seconds every morning.” Shampoo? “Herbal Essence.”  Allen continues to field questions from the intrigued, though most recently the askers were the children he had given calculators for a pre-Thanksgiving shopping trip and math lesson.  During the nearly two hours in the grocery store for his event, Allen shopped for his own groceries, helped the children with their calculations, grabbed the occasional box of penne off the top shelf for customers and answered no-filter questions.  “Can you cross Allen Iverson?” an 8-year-old boy asked.  “Given he’s about 50 years old, yes,” Allen said.  “Can you dunk on LeBron?”  “I’ve never tried,” he said.  After locating some hard-to-find items — “Where’s the crescent rolls?” — Allen checked out $40 under budget.  The feat seems to be more reflective of a lifestyle than one good day at the grocery store.  “He doesn’t have a car,” Nets forward Jared Dudley said. “He doesn’t care about materialistic things. He cares about playing basketball, family and doing what he loves to do.”  However varied that may be.  So far, Allen has splurged on just one big purchase. “A part for my computer,” he said."
"Oh yeah, is that why the season when AD sat out because he wanted to get traded Jrue holiday had 7.7 apg? His New Orleans career high with Julius Randle as his second option?  Bro, at this point you just gotta shut up and listen. How can you deny those lol? And he was 13th in **total** assists, not apg. By that metric Spencer Dinwiddie was better than Chris Paul in 2017-2018"

"Maybe Spencer Dinwiddie? He probably can’t move too much right now, but even then, I most likely still dont have a chance."
Damn. I really enjoyed the Dinwiddie/Lavert combo. Godspeed to Spencer D.
"that's a really elementary understanding of the situation but it's also not easy to just turn around the worst team in the league into an 8th seed in 2 years.   -Traded for D'Lo with limited assets  -Drafted Levert by trading Thad Young for a 1st rounder  -Drafted Allen by trading Bojan to Washington and getting a 1st rounder  -Found hidden gems in Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris. Signed them both to team friendly deals after developing them(both of them were out of the league)  -Manuevered our way into creating two max slots while also being a playoff team.  we weren't getting KD or Kyrie if we didn't have our core of pieces that made it intriguing."
He also says “they have lost Spencer Dinwiddie for the totality of the season as he is out with a partially torn *Achilles tendon*.”
"Spencer Dinwiddie - 11M  Jusuf Nurkic - 12M  Tj Warren - 12M  Malik Beasley - 13M  Serge Ibaka - 9M  Derrick Rose - 7M  I’m not saying all of these are better value, but some of them are (I’d say Rose/Ibaka for sure)"

Spencer Dinwiddie is the most random person on that list
"&gt;Pistons are expected to work toward a contract buyout with forward Blake Griffin  Blake to the Nets inc.  &gt;Several teams have pursued Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie in trade talks, sources said. There is appeal in acquiring Dinwiddie via trade in order to receive his Bird rights and offer him a deal for up to five years in free agency. Dinwiddie is expected to opt out of his $12.3 million player option for next season.  What team makes the most sense for Dinwiddie?"
"The interesting thing is that it pretty much confirms that people in the NBA watched the series, and 99% of them enjoyed it. I do remember when Spencer Dinwiddie appeared last season, he posted a pic to Twitter and said it felt like he had made it. And of course Paul Pierce posted a pic of him being crowned GOAT. Nice to see the league (barring one certain owner, obviously) having a good sense of humor over it all."

"Agree with this. Dinwiddie is a better player in a vacuum but Tucker is the type of player this team needs. We don’t need another shot creator, we need someone who can defend Anthony Davis or LeBron in the finals and knock down an open 3. There aren’t too many guys that fit that description that we could reasonably get for injured Spencer and a 2nd."
The only likeable player on the Nets is Spencer Dinwiddie.
"&gt;Lol. Please dude. This years and last years Lakers squad is more WWE than anything than I’ve ever seen in the NBA. That’s all it’s ever been with Lebron. The decision. Not 1 not 2... I literally have a comment comparing it to wrestling a few days ago.   &gt;   &gt;I went back and watched tons of old games recently and the only one that I saw Jordan get insane calls out of his great ones was his 86 playoff game where he scored 63 against the Celts in double OT. And the Bulls lost.   &gt;   &gt;I’m not saying their weren’t favorable calls. Every era has had “super star calls”. But to say the 90’s were worse than now is just absurd.  James has never led the league in free-throw attempts -- has never really even come close to doing so, in fact.  Last year as Laker, he was 16th in FTA -- behind Spencer Dinwiddie and Rudy Gobert, among others.  This year, James is 9th ( and one of few players yet to miss a game ) and he inexplicably shoots technicals for the Lakers, which adds to his total.  Jordan once shot 31% more free-throws than anyone in the league.  After that, defenders learned to stay away from him, because if you were within an arm's length, and he missed, it was a foul.  Even other superstars commented derisively on the special treatment that Jordan received.  Literally no one in league history got the calls Jordan got -- exactly because the League built their entire marketing campaign on him, for about a decade."
"Please enjoy your Spencer Dinwiddie, Pels. Thanks!"
"Yea a small part of me really misses them and would have loved to see what they could have done if they stayed on the nets, but at the same time I'll most likely never witness a Nets team with this much star talent ever again and in a weird way they feel right at home in brooklyn. Especially Kyrie, over the past 5 years the Nets have sort of become the home for NBA outcasts to get a second chance. Players like Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, DeAngelo Russel, and DeMarre Carroll were all either on their way out of the league or were viewed in a negative light before their resurgence on the Nets. Then you have players like Jeremy Lin, Mozgov, Okafor, and Shabazz Napier who were giving the chance for redemption. Hell even Levert and Allen dropped in drafts for various reasons. Kyrie was the perfect first superstar for this franchise and the fact that he came here in part because it was his childhood team and he viewed it as coming home makes it that much better."
Wasn’t he also included with Dinwiddie as a player who petitioned to be paid in Bitcoin? I know Spencer did but I think Jarrett was in on it too. Either way he’s fuckin adorable and he’s on my list of player jerseys I wanna buy
Best I can do is Spencer Dinwiddie and the rest of the Nets first round picks until 2030

How much trade value does Spencer Dinwiddie have?
Spencer Dinwiddie I love how patient he can be with the ball I hope he can come back this season
To be fair the entire MIP thing is broken.   The moment Victor Oladipo won it in 2017-18 it was proven how much of a joke the award was.   Somehow a 2nd Overall Pick living up to his expectations is all of a sudden “Most Improved Player”. Dude was already on his 2nd Contract making like $22m a year just slightly below the Max $.   Then you had someone like Spencer Dinwiddie who went from NBA wash out playing in the G-League to putting up quality numbers after looking like a complete bum the year before when fans were calling him Dimwittie for his foolish mistakes.    Then the excuse was that Oladipo’s team had a better record and he made the All Star game. All of a sudden those exact same standards don’t apply the following season for D’Angelo Russell.
"Bro I have Drummond and am down caris (but I’m glad that went down how it did), spencer dinwiddie and Wendell carter jr and now Paul George. I was 1st for 6 straight weeks and am now like 10th lol fml"
"Drummond's making nearly 3 times as much as Deandre Jordan, the salaries aren't even anywhere close enough unless the Nets throws in one from Joe Harris/Spencer Dinwiddie.     Drummond's nowhere near good enough to warrant such a trade."
"No, Spencer dinwiddie will not due to his partially torn ACL"
3 team trade where OKC gets Spencer Dinwiddie Landry Shamet and matching salary BKN gets al horford and the 3rd team is for salary filler to get OKC enough $$
I think the semi realistic dream is scour the market for a 3rd team to see if you can come up with a viable partner to make a Spencer dinwiddie Landry Shamet Nic Claxton for Al Horford framework work. You need more matching $$ which is why I said 3rd team but if you can find it that’s the one I think is a difference maker. I don’t see OKC doing this if you make them take back DeAndre since Horford is only partially guaranteed his last year
"The sheer power of Jokic gives 2014 a good case as the best one also  NIkola Jokic, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson, Glenn Robinson III. Looking at it more yeah it is better than 2012  Issue with 2nd round picks is even the guys who end up good often take years to do so and the team who drafts them doesnt think they are good and ends up dumping them. Crowder, Barton, Dinwiddie, Harris, Grant, none of these are guys who did it on the team that drafted them really."
The funny part is that technically they still have Spencer Dinwiddie
Fun Q. I think the nets would still have the stronger supporting cast especially if next year Spencer Dinwiddie is still in BK (unlikely). In just a game of 3s I’m taking bron ad and curry &gt; harden kyrie kd but that’s super close.
"They are, Jared Dudley called them one of the best in the league. The Nets monitor everything related to health and performance and even custom build fruit smoothies for every player.  https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/21/brooklyn-nets-playoffs-dangelo-russell-spencer-dinwiddie-pregame-fruit-smoothies"
Spencer Dinwiddie would light up the Sixers.
"Just for reference, say a max player invested 30 mil of his salary a year ago. Over a year btc has increased 700%. It would equal 210 million lol.   I remember Spencer Dinwiddie was huge on the bitcoin front a couple years ago. Wonder how his investments are turning out."
"5 years ago the Nets biggest signing was Jeremy Lin and Spencer Dinwiddie  10 years ago they were trying to shed Travis Outlaw, Anthony Morrow, Sasha Vujacic, and Johan Petro  they just happened to strike lightning at all the right angles and finally are putting it together"
"The NBA salary cap is not real. Kyrie Durant and Harden are all on max deals then Joe Harris Deandre Jordan and Spencer Dinwiddie all have big deals too.  We can make it work, I don’t understand how, but it’s definitely possible."
"&gt;[Billy Reinhardt] Spencer Dinwiddie refutes Marc Stein’s report that the Nets offered him to Golden State for Kelly Oubre and the Warriors declined. &gt; &gt;Dinwiddie says, “They actually lied about that sh*t because the Warriors offered Kelly Oubre for me &amp; the Nets declined.”   &gt; &gt;[Video](https://twitter.com/billyreinhardt/status/1378133002061029377?s=21)"
barton is actually good tho. he was excellent last year too. he kind of reminds of spencer dinwiddie in that theyre good players but can make boneheaded decisions a lot.
"&gt; decent averages  Uhh... did you and I read the same post?   In 2018-2019 (age 23) he ranked 127th out of 129th in FG%. Only Spencer Dinwiddie and Dennis Smith Jr. were worse than him. That was his star season where he exploded in the playoffs.   In 2018-2019 he ranked 118th out of 120th in FG%. Only Kevin Knox(lol) and Justin Holliday were worse than him. That upcoming offseason he got a damn near 20M per year deal.   The point is, he WASN'T decently average. He was one of the worst in the NBA efficiency wise."
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
"And pull Joe harris and Spencer Dinwiddie out of midair   And use late 1st round picks on Allen and Levert  And trade Musa and a 2nd for Bruce Brown   And use a 2nd round pick on Claxton  Like put some respect where it's due, Nets FO has been much better than the Celtics over the past 5 years"
"you know what else is dumb, Allen Crabbe and Spencer Dinwiddie were practically begging to come to UCLA, should have take nthem"
"I think Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie come across as likeable. Honestly I like Durant and Harden too but can understand why people might not.  Remember too we don't actually know these guys so ""likeability"" is just whatever arbitrary reasoning we apply to it from our limited glimpses at their personalities in the media."
"I think it’s pretty clear the 2 max slots were for the star players. Caris Levert, Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Jarrett Allen are very enticing surrounding pieces for 2 stars though. But go on trying to exaggerate things and delude yourself more"
"man if they had three almost-twins that came as part of the trade with these slightly fucked up versions of their own names, that'd be the best package. Jared Allen would probably be less athletic than Jarrett but Springer Dinwiddie might have Zach Lavine hops compared to Spencer. lmao I take that package over a bunch of question mark firsts and Olynyk and Bradley"
"We had the worst situation in the NBA and Marks turned that into the best. He made the team relevant with no assets because of players like Harris and Dinwiddie, great picks like Claxton and Allen. KD and Kyrie choose the team because they were in a good position for two superstars to join an already good team and Marks had the ability to trade for Harden while still keeping the bench/role players solid due to his ability to find talent. Just because Spencer got hurt doesn’t mean he’s not still on the roster"
"Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nic Claxton are some of our best talent and they are homegrown/Marks picked them up years ago cause he's a good GM  we traded for Bruce Brown because Marks is good at finding talent. We have had other players like TLC and Chiozza for years.   Our other homegrown talent we traded for James Harden because well, no shit. Marks deserves credit, calling this team artificial isn't accurate when the GM is just really good"
"we traded our homegrown assets for James Harden. We still have Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nic Claxton as some of our best players, we forgetting how good Sean Marks is to get these talented players who have either been drafted or on the team for years?  We traded for Bruce Brown. Again Sean Marks being a genius. We made good signings to build roster and have other players like TLC, Chiozza, etc left over from previous years.   Blake and LMA are literally playing like 15 minutes a game max lol"
"&gt;Yes the Brooklyn nets are being carried by joe Harris, Spencer dinwiddie, and Nicolas Claxton. Definitely not the other players on your team.  That's not what you said. You said that we have 0 homegrown talent on the team, not players carrying the team. Stop shifting the goalposts.  &gt;You’re being downvoted because you’re acting like he created some amazing feat.  Going from being the worst team in the league, to title favourites in the space of 5 years is an incredible feat. I sense jealousy  &gt;You were the only place that kd and Kyrie could come together that was better than the knicks. That’s it.  There's 30 teams in the NBA. It's not just the Knicks and Nets.   Brooklyn had no draft picks or young talent when Marks took over. He regained draft picks by taking on salary dumps (Zeller, Mozgov, etc.) attached with picks, and drafted very well, landing guys like LeVert, Allen and Claxton. He found some absolute hidden gems in the g-league in Harris and Dinwiddie, and took a chance on guys with high potential like DLo. He hired Atkinson as coach, who was terrific in developing these young guys, and making them play incredibly hard, fun basketball. Marks targeted 2019 offseason to make a splash in free agency, as he made enough space for 2 max players. Our change in culture, combined with our very promising young core, and respected coaching staff/front office made KD and Kyrie want to come here.  I can't tell if you're being intentionally ignorant or you're just salty. Why don't you educate yourself on everything Sean Marks has done as GM since he got the job in 2016. It's absolutely nothing to do with being ""straight lucky"". He's a guy that Popovich constantly talks about being one of the most intelligent individuals he's ever coached/worked with."
"Im saying its half assed if you keep overpaying players who arent close to sure things. Paying Randle worked out. Paying someone who is frequently injured and somewhat inconsistent $25m is imo a half assed attempt at a rebuild. I understand yall have the cap space for another star but that $5+m that could have gone to rounding out your roster. If you pay him $18-20m and we dont match so be it. And yall missed out on a shit ton of stuff at the trade deadline. 2021 FA class is pretty meh since you arent getting kawhi. CP3, spencer dinwiddie and Kyle Lowry so ironically its probably the most options for signing a PG, maybe theyd have to be overpaid to idk."
"Yes the Brooklyn nets are being carried by joe Harris, Spencer dinwiddie, and Nicolas Claxton. Definitely not the other players on your team. You’re being downvoted because you’re acting like he created some amazing feat. No. You were the only place that kd and Kyrie could come together that was better than the knicks. That’s it. Now you have a bunch of ring chasers chasing the ring this year that’ll inevitably come after harden forced his way out of Houston onto the nets. You had almost no rebuild. It was straight lucky"
"So Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie and Nicolas Claxton don't exist then?  Why the fuck have I been downvoted into oblivion for stating that our GM has done a terrific job rebuilding this franchise from absolutely nothing, to the best in the league? You people are so fucking delusional."
"Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Bruce Brown, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Reggie Bullock are all in NY now"
They signed to veteran minimum contracts. Those contracts can't go over the hard cap but they can go by ber the soft cap and into luxury tax if they need to because the Nets have a mid level player exception and an injured player exception because spencer dinwiddie can't play this season.
And Spencer Dinwiddie...
What about Spencer dinwiddie once he's back from injury.
"Harden, Kyrie Irving, kevin durant, Blake griffin, deandre Jordan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Claxston, shamet, Bruce brown, Joe Harris, spencer dinwiddie. They have enough talent to create 2 playoff caliber starting lineups. Seems fair /s"
"They focus too much on being a football school.   Also a lot of the talent gets recruited and divvied up amongst the powerhouse Pac 12 and to some extent the Mountain West programs. If you grow up in a talent rich SoCal there isnt one or two particular programs you choose from unlike Bama/Auburn, Texas/Texas A&amp;M, Ohio/Ohio St, or Michigan/Michigan St etc...Theres a ton of options. You can go to UCLA, Arizona, ASU, Stanford, San Diego State or other really good programs on the west coast.   Also because its so talent rich, if youre a lesser star recruit for instance playing in SoCal, you might either slip through the cracks or think of being the star of a nearby Pac 12/Mountain West program than being more of a role player for USC/UCLA. (ie Kawhi at SDSU, Tony Snell at New Mexico, Spencer Dinwiddie at Colorado, Klay at Washington State, Delon Wright at Utah, Matisse Thybulle at Washington"
Spencer dinwiddie to come back&lt;3
Give us bruce brown and/or Spencer dinwiddie   I miss them
"No the Nets have more than a shot😂😂 Kyrie, Harden, Kd, Harris, Shamet. Deandre and Blake on bench that is 100% better than the Lakers, also imagine if Spencer Dinwiddie wasnt injured"
"&gt;Houston, Dallas, Denver and Golden State have also expressed notable interest in Gordon dating back to November's draft. Orlando's asking price appears reasonable, seeking a combination of picks and young players. It's uncertain what youngster the Timberwolves would have sent the Magic, but before the Nets acquired James Harden in mid-January, Brooklyn first presented an offer involving either Caris LeVert or Spencer Dinwiddie for Gordon, sources said, yet the Magic were seeking a higher 2020 draft asset than the Nets were able to secure."
"also did you [see this](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2936163-rival-nba-execs-see-major-trade-opportunity-in-orlandos-available-stars), werent you the one who months ago said you would trade Caris LeVert for Aaron Gordon. Apparently the Nets tried! Article says ""before the Nets acquired James Harden in mid-January, Brooklyn first presented an offer involving either Caris LeVert or Spencer Dinwiddie for Gordon, sources said, yet the Magic were seeking a higher 2020 draft asset than the Nets were able to secure.""  So it sounds like they wanted LeVert and more than a bottom 2020 first perhaps back then.   Also sounds like he's generating more buzz than Vucevic: ""Vucevic's market does not seem nearly as vast.'"
Replace one of those guards with a healthy Spencer dinwiddie.
Spencer dinwiddie is not a star
Spencer Dinwiddie
PJ for Spencer dinwiddie  Replies will say no from both sides which is part of why I think it’s a reasonable proposal
"Counter argument: they’re the team to root for because of the power of friendships: KD and Jeff Green go way back to Sonics days, Harden KD Jeff Green OKC days, Blake Deandre Lob City, Nash Amare MDA Suns coaching staff, KD Kyrie Deandre the 3 musketeers that signed with the Nets to make it all happen. And the rewarding underdog/ feels good stories for guys like Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, come back story for Blake"
"What did the Utah front office did before coming into this season that drastically improved their team? They brought Derrick Favors back...  That’s not much move at all, it was the same roster with continuity growing from the year before and everyone being healthy and grooving now.   Nets on the other hand basically retool half the farm to get Harden, with injury to Spencer Dinwiddie, addition of Jeff Green prior to start of the season, new addition of Blake, new coaching staff of Nash and Mr Pringles... it’s so much more impressive what they accomplished in short amount of time to put them in title contending position"
"TBF, Harris shot 47% from 3 in 2018-19 when he was surrounded by D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Caris LeVert."
"Was just as surprised. RJ was snubbed like three times while on the Nets. The current era is definitely McCollum, can't really think of anyone else, Spencer Dinwiddie???"
"&gt;There has been a long-whispered rumor of Brooklyn possibly sending Spencer Dinwiddie to Houston for Tucker  So are they just forgetting that they easily could have had Dinwiddie instead of Allen in the Harden trade?  Also, why do they want him now anyways.  He's not a young player, nor is he locked up and he's coming off an ACL injury."
"I'm just basing off the Lakers current starting lineup. You can swap Gasol with someone else. This can be Morris, Harrell or Kuzma. If Morris or Harrell are in the game, are you putting them on KD?   I'm not saying that Lakers don't have a shot, but the sheer firepower of the Nets is so dangerous. If you consider that you have not even taken into consideration Spencer Dinwiddie leading the bench next season, you can understand why Nets are the easy favourites"
"Good point, but if everyone agrees to let Spencer come back, If I’m Nash what do you do?   I’d(and this is just my unimportant opinion) let Dinwiddie and Kyrie run with the bench unit with Spencer as a facilitator. Hamstring injuries seems like one of the injuries that linger on a while. If I can buy Harden just a little bit of rest, I would"
"From a player perspective, if you believe in your ability (and your front office/coach), you can make up for the salary cut in endorsements/sponsorship.  If you are an elite player in your sport, those deals often dwarf your contract anyways. I'm surprised more players in salary capped sports don't ""cheat"" by taking lower salaries. Its a major loophole to salary-capped sports, that very few players take advantage of.  I mean look at the Nets. Harden and KD are each 25% of the salary cap. Kyrie is 20%. That 5% basically accounts for them being able to have DeAndre Jordan (6.23%) or Spencer Dinwiddie (6.87%) on the roster vs. a minimum contract guy (~1%).  Every little bit helps.  Right now Vuch is at 20% and Zach is at 15%. I don't know the exact numbers, but if Zach takes 20% rather than 25%, that is huge for roster construction potential."
"Spencer Dinwiddie would've been a perfectly acceptable draft pick over Randle. Nobody foresaw Randle becoming a father would change his work ethic so drastically, and then there'd be a global pandemic that caused him to miss the bubble, get mad about it, and have a long offseason to work on his game to this point."
"I think it's just Boston and they don't really have room to grow beyond internal development.  Not saying that as an insult to them, they should probably be near the Knicks on this list.  But Butler and Dragic are getting older.  Toronto is probably thinking long term.  Indiana is melting down right now.  I guess the Hawks will continue to grow but their cap is gonna be pretty fucked with Collins this summer.  The whole article is a guess but I think it's fine to guess that a top destination with 60 mil in cap room can marginally improve their standing over the next three years or so.  It's not like KD and Kyrie were drawn to the opportunity to team up with Caris Levert and Spencer Dinwiddie, New York and LA teams will always have a competitive advantage and the Knicks are the only franchise among those cities with cash to spend right now"
Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie were literally done in the league
Get rid of Bledsoe and Adams ASAP. Try to add some defense/shooting in place of Bled at the shooting guard and look for a rim protector at the 5. Use the Bledsoe and Adams contracts as filler and bundle with the firsts from the Jrue/AD trades to try and get some pieces to compete with.   Some other ideas I’ve considered is the pelicans moving Lonzo to shooting guard and trading for a point guard like Spencer Dinwiddie.   It also looks like Jaxson Hayes is starting to put it together. Maybe he gets the promotion to starter and they just go all in on finding more shooting.
Shouts out to the complete dismissal of homegrown talent like Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris and building a top team with zero draft assets after complete mismanagement.

Spencer Dinwiddie / Thomas Bryant
"that was with jarrett allen, caris levert, and spencer dinwiddie in the picture.  I dont think the nets can win it all without Harden. The record this season without Harden is painfully average. I do think they can win it without Kyrie though. Harden and Durant would be enough"
"I’m glad you mentioned the 42 win season cause that just proved my point. Marks was responsible for trades that got us Dlo, and trades that landed us Allen/Caris Levert. He also made great pickups with Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris.    Suns did not inherit the Billy king disaster, neither did you turn a historically irrelevant team, only 10 years into a new city, into a team with 3 HOF players. Everything your saying is great, but fails in comparison.   Another reason I’m glad you mentioned the 42 win season: it shows this was a slow build up. People think we just walked into KD/Kyrie/Harden. No, 2 of them were rumored to go to the Knicks all of that season prior to when they came to us. Marks built a playoff team then a championship favorite   Like idk man, Marks taking the Billy king situation and turning it into this, far outweighs JJ turning around a regular bad team. Quite a few teams were in a similar situation as The Sun. Very few were in Marks situation at all  When marks became GM full time, we won only one game more than the 19 win Suns you keep referring to and you won 34 games last season.."
"Sean Marks did the following:  * Signed Joe Harris, a second round draft pick that was previously waived by the Magic and had gone 7 months without being picked up by another team * Signed Spencer Dinwiddie, a second round draft pick that was previously waived by the Bulls and was playing in the D league * Traded for Bruce Brown and Laundry Shamet by giving up a 2020 mid first round pick, a 2020 late second round pick, a player picked late second in 2019, and a player picked super late first round in 2018. The 2020 mid first round pick is the only player currently on an NBA team, Brown and Shamet are staples in the Nets rotation and will see significant playoff time while possibly even starting in a few games. * Signed Tyler Johnson, a player previously waived by the Suns that had gone 4 months without being picked up by another team"
Spencer Dinwiddie if healthy
Next season when Spencer Dinwiddie is leading the bench too :)
Spencer Dinwiddie and his token.
I want Spencer Dinwiddie and idk why that isn’t brought up more. Schroeder is cool though I guess
Maybe an emba after he retires. Or that leadership seminar thing that spencer dinwiddie attended
IIRC the only two players on the Nets who were also on the team 2 years ago are Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie.   That’s pretty absurd for them to be the championship favorite now.
Spencer Dinwiddie
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
"That 2014 draft has been quite the roller coaster.  A lot of hype early on, and then injuries and bad situations kind of tamped down expectations. But, now, a lot of those players have carved out really solid careers.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2014.html  Embiid, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Marcus Smart, and Aaron Gordon are the top 5 players from that lottery, and the 2nd round had Jokic, Jerami Grant, &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie...  So, potentially, the top 2 MVP candidates, and 4 all stars total from that draft this season. Pretty impressive. Just not who we expected them to be coming out...  Just goes to show you have to wait several years before truly judging a draft. But, we’ll still judge anyway... 😒"
"Spencer ""Don't Tell Me The Odds"" Dinwiddie"
"We’ve been writing some articles about NBA players using NBA Top Shot, including Terry Rozier, Josh Hart, and Spencer Dinwiddie. This week, we wrote about [Harrison Barnes](https://www.nft-boyz.com/2021/04/heres-how-harrison-barnes-became-nbas.html?m=1), who is the most active NBA player on the platform."
"By that metric, every statistic is “kinda useless” and “clearly a bad one” then because no stat will ever rank every player in a perfect order that everyone can agree on. I feel like the main idea of these statistics in basketball are to give a barometer of who’s great at things. Not everything has to be in perfect order. So CP3 being ranked just 0.4 behind Spencer Dinwiddie doesn’t make it “clearly bad” imo"
"I think KD Kyrie vs AD LeBron would have been a competitive and exhilarating finals, and I would still have given the nets the edge with Jaret Allen and Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LaVert  James Harden quitting his way to Brooklyn lopsided the matchup by a mile  &amp;#x200B;  KD doesn't want to compete"
You forgot Spencer Dinwiddie
Yeah a complete nobody compared to…  \* checks notes \*  Spencer Dinwiddie
Ah yes Star player Spencer Dinwiddie
"I made this point earlier:   &gt;Season- or series-derailing injuries happen to multiple teams every season.   Which is what I am talking about when it comes to risk that I think you are ignoring. We've seen it happen this year, we saw it happen to the Heat in last years' Finals, we saw it happen to Golden State in 2019, the Cavs in 2015, etc. To not plan for injuries through the playoffs these days is a choice. And I agree with you that the Nets can't be expected to win through the whole playoffs with all of these injuries, but most championship teams withstand some downswings throughout 2 months of the Playoffs. Harden isn't even expected out long-term (and a healthy Kyrie was around for 3.25 games against the Bucks).  The Nets aren't being asked to win the entire NBA Playoffs down two starters. They are being asked to win one game without two starters to buy themselves some time for Kyrie or Harden to recover (and lo and behold, Harden is likely back for Game 5).  For example, GSW, Miami, and the Cavs all battled injuries to win a game or two to extend the series. It's possible to win a game to extend a series down multiple starters. Overall, though, championship-caliber teams can't just expect to get through the NBA playoffs unscathed.   The Nets chose to use a ton of assets to get Harden (agreed he provided superstar insurance against injury-concerns for Durant &amp; Kyrie). In doing so, the Nets made a trade-off towards superstars and away from depth. That's a great deal! Nothing wrong with that and I think most folks make that deal. But, as Zach Lowe has mentioned this multiple times on his podcast: it was a trade-off to ensure they would have at least 2 superstars in case of injuries (which is exactly what has occurred) at the expense of depth and other usages of their assets. But this wasn't a trade to go to 'no risk' this is literally two different forms of risk... and they are attempting to manage it. I think its useful to point out that both Levert and Allen would be playing meaningful minutes in this series. I think its also useful to point out that the Bucks are also without a starter (DiVincenzo).  Furthermore, using their assets for Harden precluded them from using those assets in other deals (what about using those draft picks/swaps to go after two high-quality starters and keeping Allen or Levert?). What if, instead of making their top-3 players the best in the league, they had tried to make their 3-7 the best in the league? Again, they chose what they chose but what I am saying is that the Nets made a choice to rely on guys like Blake Griffin or Spencer Dinwiddie, and this really reduced their ability to withstand multiple injuries to players that have known injury risks (outside of Harden).  I cannot think of a better analogy than portfolios when it comes to managing teams and risks.   &gt;It’s insane to argue otherwise.       Then clearly I am insane and no team has ever surmounted injuries to extend their playoff chances..."
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
"doesn't even have spencer dinwiddie to play point, whatever that's worth."
"Bro that’s not even the only ones. Tobias Harris, Bruce brown, Spencer dinwiddie, Middleton (kinda). There’s a bunch more in the playoffs who were former pistons haha"
"Top 10 defensive win shares for 2020-21  Spencer Dinwiddie  Henry Ellenson  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert  LeBron James  Julius Randle  Elijah Bryant  Dante Exum  Ben Simmons  RJ Barrett  This is your voting list for all-defensive teams, correct?"
Could really use.. ahm Spencer Dinwiddie right about now
"That’s a fair point, and although he isn’t available right now, let’s not forget about Spencer Dinwiddie. And I’m just saying how “the roster outside of the stars is ass” isn’t really the case."
"Ok so Spencer Dinwiddie, you’re good to go right?"
"Dr, Revered Sir Spencer Dinwiddie the IVth, Attorney at Law."
"This is a really easy fallacy to fall into because core stats aren't as scalable as impact metrics, but ultimately even if Zach is paid like a high end 6 man/ 3 and D Starter instead of an all star, the major all-NBA players in the league typically have impacts that are even higher than their max contracts (hence why the max exists, so there isn't a speculation war over if Lebron is worth 50 million or 70 million etc and you dont have a star surrounded by 10 PJ Tuckers).  Zach is on a relatively cheap contract but you have to pair that cheapness with oppurtunity cost of not having a higher paid but bonafide star. So if Joel Embiid makes $30 million and Zach makes 18 Million, the question youre asking is with Zach plus whichever player you can buy for $12 million = Joel Embiid. So is Zach Lavine plus Jae Crowder or plus Spencer Dinwiddie or plus Joe Harris better than Joel Embiid (no, but the Zach + Joe Harris seems close). Ultimately, no matter how much else you can buy due to Zachs cheaper contract, it will never equal 1 Joel Embiid, or Jokic, or Giannis or Harden or Lebron because their impact is scalable.  Also the impact metrics are still out on Levine as a primary ball handler and as a defender. This year was a revelation just shooting wise and the contract he gets will make this one look cheap, but, simultaneously, the contract he gets will over pay him for his impact"
"When I'm on mobile, ""din""   When I'm on my desktop, ""Sir Spencer Gray Dinwiddie"""
ESPN : Spencer Dinwiddie hates KD and doesn't want him to play in the NBA.
"recently saw an article (published within the last month, i think) where spencer dinwiddie said he's obviously going to refuse his option because he's ""obviously"" a starting PG who can get $20-25/year.  i think he's obviously not starting for the nets as long as harden/kyrie are there so i guess he doesn't want a (probably) easy ring or anything.  his shooting percentages last year looked similar to schroder (schroder slightly more efficient), he just made more attempts.  beyond that maybe he has physique going for him.  i don't really know much about him otherwise.  he didn't shit the bed recently in a playoff series, but schroder isn't coming off an achilles tear not even half a year ago either.  do you guys think they should be getting similar contracts in free agency?"
Nets losing Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie will be less competitive anyway so it would be change for good.
Spencer Dinwiddie. That's where he recruited Kyrie to the Nets and probably where he got his idea to transfer his contract into bitcoin.
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/shlomosprung/2021/05/13/spencer-dinwiddie-discusses-returning-to-brooklyn-nets-this-season-from-torn-acl-progress-on-his-calaxy-app/?sh=53d7fcc22c30  he's floated the idea that he's worth $20-25M as a starter.  i guess this is more seeing if he can get other teams to bite and then seeing if brooklyn will increase their offer, but like he and dennis schroder have similar efficiency and other basic stats (although dinwiddie is taller and bigger and schroder is actually more efficient, he just takes fewer shots than dinwiddie did last year). i thought the theory was that schroder could get $100M/4yr because the lakers had no way of replacing him if he dipped, but he wasn't worth that on the open market.  but however rich the nets owners are, i feel like they have a limit to what extra they're willing to spend on a backup PG.  on mobile I can't write a comment while looking at my previous one but iirc i thought next year they'd basically be $30M over the luxury tax threshold without dinwiddie for a tax bill of $93M.  if he got just $20M then being $50M over takes the tax bill to $248M.  does the additional $170M+ of his salary and the additional tax _ensure_ a chip in the event kyrie or harden is unavailable?  maybe it's worth it to them if it does, but...."
"Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jokic, and Jerami Grant in the 2nd round. Some insane 2nd rounders that draft."
he has a max contract and he's playing the same as spencer dinwiddie
Future Iron-Man Spencer Dinwiddie.
"Lmao we can give you guys Deandre Jordan, and Spencer Dinwiddie but I don't even think I would give up Claxton"
"They're destroying the Bucks missing Harden, Jeff Green, and Spencer Dinwiddie.  They aren't just fair, they're playing with a handicap."
Imagine if Spencer Dinwiddie didn't tear his ACL
Here's a scary thought: if not for a freak illness this team could have LaMarcus Aldridge at the 5 and if not for a freak ACL tear they also would have Spencer Dinwiddie in the line-up. Oh and James Harden is in street clothes on the bench.
And Spencer Dinwiddie
Cryptocurrency enthusiast Spencer Dinwiddie
No Harden. Jeff Green. Spencer Dinwiddie. And technically LMA
and Spencer Dinwiddie XD
And Jeff Green and Spencer Dinwiddie.
Sign Spencer Dinwiddie. I don’t want them to do this but I think he’d be a good fit for them as an upgrade and replacement for Schroeder
Maybe they could sign Spencer Dinwiddie in the off-season?
"Donte already out. Wouldnt count out KD/Kyrie getting injured either (hope not). Ppl seem to forget LMA, not to mention Spencer Dinwiddie. They would have made the Nets most stacked team ever imo."
"The Nets are still missing Dinwiddie, Green, and I dunno if you count this one but LMA. Spencer is kind of redundant in this team but the latter two are sorely missed."
"Celtics fans love to pretend KD and Kyrie just chilled one day and said “Brooklyn” and that Sean Marks, Kenny Atkinson, DLO, Jarrett Allen, and Spencer Dinwiddie were never born."
Spencer Dinwiddie played 0 games for the 20-21 Nets and seems to have been banished from the team
"Spencer Dinwiddie too. Never said they were a bigger deal, it just wouldn't change the outcome of this series"
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
"Lowry -&gt; Heat  Conley -&gt; re-ups with Jazz  DeRozan -&gt; Knicks  Oladipo -&gt; re-ups with Heat  Dragic -&gt; Dallas  Porter -&gt; Nets  Hardaway -&gt; re-ups with Mavs  Schroder -&gt; re-ups with Lakers  Rose -&gt; re-ups with Knicks   Tucker -&gt; MIL/BKN/PHX  Lou Will -&gt; ATL or retirement  Lonzo -&gt; Bulls   Ibaka -&gt; re-ups with Clips or retires  Collins -&gt; Spurs  Also, your list forgot Spencer Dinwiddie. Really interested to see where he ends up, don't really have a gauge of where he'll go/what his market is. Maybe Detroit?"
"He quit on us as soon as he saw JT &amp; JB leading us to the ECF, Spencer Dinwiddie was quoted saying Kyrie reached out to him in December.   He spun his lies about wanting to resign so that he could have the flexibility to decline his player option and sign as a FA in Brooklyn.   If we traded Kyrie to the Nets they wouldnt have had the players to trade for KD."
"&gt;This is he first time all year we're seeing the nets at full power,   Spencer Dinwiddie is still out and Jeff Green is out now"
"from what i can tell, they'll only get weaker if they're not willing to pay (luxury tax will be massive) but not because they won't be allowed to keep the pieces they have.  the only real question seems to be blake, because he might not go for a second year on the vet minimum, even if he's still getting pistons money.  would he take the mini MLE?  also, with spencer dinwiddie back, I'd think they'd actually get better.  or they can let him go to relieve cap space and not get worse."
Not really but Knicks can get better if they improve their roster. They might try to lure Lonzo Ball or Spencer Dinwiddie for ball handling. Hell I would tell their front office to make an offer for Jarret Allen. That sort of front court presence is not readily available. They better be prepared to offer more than $100M because that's what Cavs are willing to pay just to keep him. You're right Lowry is not worth it considering his age and injury history.
"When I think of big Brooklyn Nets stars, I think of Spencer Dinwiddie.  I wonder how much CEL he's getting with this sponsorship."
Who is rushing in to buy crypto because Spencer Dinwiddie is getting paid in it lol?
Derrick rose. Obi toppin. Spencer dinwiddie
"Caris and Jarrett Allen were used as TRADE pieces for James Harden, that's not bought. Again, a TRADE. That's where players are traded to another team for another player. They aren't bought from another team.  Also, Joe Harris, you may know him from last night's game, was picked up out of the garbage bin. Spencer Dinwiddie is injured, but he was as well."
"So true. Joey Buckets and Spencer Dinwiddie are the only guys left from our original group a few years ago, and  Din is injured."
If it weren't for injuries they'd have Spencer Dinwiddie and Lamarcus Aldridge too.
True. I’d rather have spencer dinwiddie at this point or even derrick rose over Dipo.
"Yeah, too bad he was on such a shitty team with Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris Lavert, Joe Harris, and Jarrett Allen. That team already had a good shot of winning the title but Durant can't help but always take the easiest way possible."
"Don't forget, if they run it back, they have Spencer Dinwiddie too"
"Khris Middleton, Spencer Dinwiddie, Dennis Rodman.  Am i missing Something?"
Khris Middleton and Spencer dinwiddie
I hope Memphis gets a better backup point guard in the off season.  Idk if they can make the deal but they would be an awesome Spencer Dinwiddie team if Brooklyn is looking to trade him for whatever reason.
"Small market teams had the same opportunity to pick Joe Harris or Spencer Dinwiddie off waivers, or draft LeVert, J. Allen in the late 1st round, or Nic Claxton in the 2nd round.  This is not just about big vs. small market."
"We have a lot   Joe Harris - 33rd pick   Spencer Dinwiddie 38th pick   Bruce Brown - 42nd pick   Nic Claxton - 31st pick    (if we're talking about only players we drafted specifically, then Claxton is the only answer)"
"I mean you can handwave it all away because of KD, Kyrie and Harden but the Nets absolutely made some great moves in the past few seasons. D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen just off the top of my head are/were awesome players for them and helped get them to where they are today."
"This isn't necessarily about this game, but about this ""Lebron gets all the calls"" narrative. Lebron is one of, if not the, most powerful athletes we have seen in this game. He consistently attacks the rim and battles through a ton of contact on a nightly basis. With this power, athleticism and playing style, you would assume he'd be among the league leaders in foul shots per game, right? Wrong. This season Lebron is 23rd in free throw attempts per game with 5.7 attempts. Embiid is shooting 10.7 per game. Lebron is behind Trae, DeMar, fox, sexton, jerami grant, ja, dbook, etc. Last year he was 19th and shot the same amount 5.7 per game. Spencer dinwiddie shot 7 per game. Harden shot 11.8 per game. This has generally been the case his whole career.   Can anyone defend this narrative with actual numbers? Is there anyone making this claim who wants to have an honest discussion?"
"It's not a great FA class coming up though. Maybe throw a bag at Spencer Dinwiddie and another at Norman Powell?  Spurs don't generally attract big name free agents, I think LMA was an exception, so it might be worthwhile overpaying to get competitive while maintaining long-term flexibility."
"Nah, the Vuc trade was smart. How many more young players can they churn through? Lavine getting covid derailed this season.  But Vuc and Lavine are a great pair. White is a strong 6 man type and Williams was one of the youngest guys in the draft, he's an awesome defensive swiss army knife, and way more offensively capable than someone like a Thybulle.  They just need to figure out their point situation. Maybe a guy like a Spencer Dinwiddie would be a great piece."
&gt; Spencer Dinwiddie  &gt; Indiana Pacers  Would they do a Dinwidde for Turner S&amp;T?  Also weird that they're interested in Dinwiddie when they already have Brogdon and LeVert.
"Hey Joe, re-sign Bruce Brown and Spencer Dinwiddie. Keep doing what you're doing.  &gt;(10-sentence minimum)   no"
Great points. Made me realize ... me along with all sports media has forgotten about Spencer Dinwiddie being on the squad and how much even better the nets could be on an already all-time team
"Obviously there was a lot of luck involved getting their stars, but let's not forget the 18-19 season where they were 6th in the East with All-Star D'Angelo Russell and supplemented by dudes they drafted late like Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert, or traded for like Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie.  Yes the FO massively fucked up the Celtics trade, but it's not like they've been totally sitting on their ass since"
"As a Bulls fan looking for a PG to fit alongside Zach Lavine and Nikola Vucevic I would go with:  1 Malcolm Brogdon  2 Spencer Dinwiddie  3 Fred VanVleet  Brogdon *slightly* edges out the others in some more advanced stats like TS% or PER but it's very slight.  Dinwiddie is the best facilitator of the group, but again it's only a slight edge.  For the Bulls it'd come down to the best on ball defender as that's currently a weakness on the roster in guarding other elite PGs in the NBA."
"Don't get me wrong, I love Spencer Dinwiddie, but it's honestly been kinda refreshing not having to watch him complain after EVERY. SINGLE. PLAY."
the nets wouldve won if spencer dinwiddie was healthy. not even harden and kyrie. they needed one less injury lmao
I don’t understand why people are coming up with these scenarios in the first place (like Spencer Dinwiddie did). If the Bucks win then Giannis will win the award and that’s the end of the discussion
"3 1st picks that all led to generational talents. 2/3 got traded and I expect the 3rd to be on his way out soon considering the Williamson family is silently acting like Lavar Ball. The most cheering you do is for players you trade away.    You're trying to replace Lonzo Ball with Chris Paul/Spencer Dinwiddie/Kyle Lowry who are not coming to NOLA. Considering the overlap of Saints fans, I'm surprised that Pelican fans talk about their franchise like they have any hope. Your offense has no shooters and your defensive effort is pitiful at best. It should've been a big red flag the moment we traded you the 4th pick, and you somehow turned it into Jaxon Hayes and then go out and sign Adams to an absurd extension the following year."
"The Bucks are not deeper than the Nets. Outside of the big 3 Nets have Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Spencer Dinwiddie, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Claxton, and Bruce Brown. Bucks have Brook, Divencenzo, Tucker, Portis, Forbes, Teague, and Connaughton. The Nets were 1 shot away from going up 3-0 without harden playing at all. Its not to discredit the Bucks, I had them as the 2nd best team going into the playoffs but don't discredit the Nets for not having a deep team like the Bucks."

The entire point is that these players make agreements and even if their feelings change those agreements are still in effect.  Your example would be like Houston saying ""we're just going to dock John Wall's contract by 20m/y and give the money to Spencer Dinwiddie instead. It's fine because we're still honouring the contract with Spencer Dinwiddie"", which no team in the NBA has done."

Nothing is going to change.  This offseason the Mavs will wait on Kawhi while a bunch of other players sign or get traded.  Then they'll announce a 4/$72 million contract with Spencer Dinwiddie and Cuban will proclaim he was their #1 target all along.

Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
"idk it's pretty common for players to develop later. he's the current exception but there's one on every team. Pat Bev, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, Khris Middleton, Marcus was considered worse than Markieff for a good while, Seth Curry, Spencer Dinwiddie, most teams have a guy who developed late and became a productive member of a playoff team. There's lots of routes in the nba and late bloomers for sure exist."
"This is the problem with r/nba that people say dumb shit and don’t get checked for it. We HAD bad player development because of Luke Walton’s staff. Now we have had for the last two years the best development coach in all of basketball in Phil Handy. Look at the Kings under Walton and you see their young talent hasn’t quite reached potential, and then look at how literally every NBA player works with Phil Handy. He has been an assistant coach on Nick Nurse’s staff, Tyronn Lue’s staff, and Frank Vogel’s staff. He has and still works with guys like Kawhi, Lebron, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Pascal Siakam, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Spencer Dinwiddie, and countless others that all have sung praises about him. There’s a reason why Steve Nash wanted him on his staff this past offseason and the Wizards were interviewing him for the job this offseason."

"Better than most people think, much worse than what Spencer Dinwiddie thinks"
I’d assume most nba players under 25 are into anime.  Spencer Dinwiddie is the biggest weeb out there.
"Dinwiddie first proposed tokenizing his three-year contract in September 2019. But meeting fierce opposition from the NBA and facing threats that he could see his contract terminated, the point guard retooled and delayed his sale. It launched on Jan. 13, 2020. The sale began in March.  The project was recast as a bond sale that raised the contract’s upfront value and allowed Dinwiddie access to more capital sooner as a business loan. His shareholders (the token holders) would in turn receive payouts as the season progressed.   www.coindesk.com/nba-player-spencer-dinwiddies-token-sale-hits-10-of-13-5m-goal%3famp=1"
Interesting. What do you think about spencer dinwiddie looking for 25m/yr?    People were scoffing at that one but seems reasonable.    Since you bring up kennard... his relationship with the clippers is hilarious. They traded for him.  Gave him a big contract... yet he’s still somehow the red headed step child of the team
Spencer Schröder or Dennis Dinwiddie?
any team that gives spencer dinwiddie 25mil deserves relocation
[Nope.](https://www.netsdaily.com/2020/10/22/21529461/spencer-dinwiddie-drops-agent-will-reportedly-rep-himself)
The 2022 Nets are going to end up like Mr. Burn's ringer team.    James Harden: Arrested for narcotics in France  Kevin Durant: Hypnotized into believing he's a snake  Kyrie Irving: Fell off the edge of the earth  Blake Griffin: Gets into a car accident while filming a KIA commercial  Joe Harris: Refuses to shave his pubes and gets kicked off the team  DeAndre Jordan: Gets dwarfism eating a special brain and nerve pizza developed by team doctors  Jeff Green: Too buy rescuing people during a hurricane  Spencer Dinwiddie: Knocked out by local oaf over argument about who's the real NY team
"D'Lo was an all star and lead the Brooklyn Nets to the playoffs like 2 years ago. His next best teammates were Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie. Since then, he has been traded and hurt and unable to build any stability where he has been at until the second half of this last season, where the TWolves performed kinda decently (9-7 in the last month of the season)  Cmon man"
"I'm aware of his [spot-up numbers:](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-not-so-rapid-rise-of-spencer-dinwiddie-and-the-case-he-has-to-make/)  &gt; On catch-and-shoot 3s, the shots that would become more important next to Durant and Irving, Dinwiddie is shooting a perfectly respectable 37.3 percent.  But even on the shots that are those side-steps and step-backs included in that total percentage cited, I think Reggie performs better, and Spencer's willingness to pull them shits is alarming. He had some questionable shot selection in '19-'20 -- but I guess such is the nature of becoming the #1 option when a star goes down.   If the Clippers end up getting him, I'd be oh so okay with him proving me wrong."
I feel like Spencer Dinwiddie would do some corny shit like this
"I noticed this when he got lit up by Derrick Rose on the Pistons two years ago, he just couldn't cope with his deceleration. We generally struggle with that guard profile more than most, I feel. From Jamal Murray to Spencer Dinwiddie. I'm not sure it's a new problem for him or it's always been the case. We used to have Avery Bradley then Rozier as the primary on those match ups, maybe it's always been the case."
Rumours say the Lakers are eyeing Spencer Dinwiddie or Kemba Walker.  Its the lakers. They are not forced to keep every player. They have always a pool of players who are willing to come.  You just have to manage the salary cap.
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).

And you think other players are stupid. He clearly is disillusioned by money and is getting influenced left and right. Spencer Dinwiddie might talk about money a lot but other than the NBA contracts it’s a lot of nonsense
"Haha, there’s so many of those guys in the NBA. It’s like if Spencer Dinwiddie found himself on a good team, stayed healthy and got more minutes, he may be able to do the same. But no one right now is like, “imagine if we started Spencer Dinwiddie!!!”   (I know he is on the awesome Nets, but he wasn’t healthy just like the rest of the Nets)."
 &gt;&gt;I've heard numerous reports about Spencer Dinwiddie being interested in the Clippers this free agency  How? I can only imagine maybe Marcus Morris sign and trade? Kennard?
"I'm tired of all the nonsense trade scenarios involving LaVine. The Bulls aren't going to trade him! He's a stud scoring guard and the exact type of player who will thrive in the playoffs.  The single biggest reason the Bulls have been scuffling the past few years (aside from Jim Boylen) is their lack of a decent Point Guard. I'm confident the new front office will plug that hole with someone the likes of: Lonzo Ball, Spencer Dinwiddie, Reggie Jackson, Cam Payne.   So the idea of LaVine in a 76ers jersey is just as improbable as Embiid in a Bulls jersey."
"I’m cool with trying to compete and not just relying on picks and the lottery but I also question if a borderline all star (barely top 30) good center who has some struggles defensively is worth an ok prospect and two firsts one of which is top 10. But we’ve done what we’ve done, so now we need to maximize LaVine and Vucevic and hope Patrick Williams is as good as advertised. We need a new PF, wing depth, and a new PG (Spencer Dinwiddie, Furkan Korkmaz, Bobby Portis is the dream but we probably can’t afford all of them unless we trade Thaddeus for a first, and find a way to dump Satoransky and Aminu)"
"KD opted out weeks after a torn achillies....   before you say he's KD, Spencer Dinwiddie."
"I do not mean this as an insult, but you need to understand how the cap works in the NBA.   Hard caps are only triggered if you use the non tax payer MLE, sign and trade, or bi annual exception.   Otherwise, you can resign your own players and go over the cap. Your penalty is the luxury tax.   160m is a lot but they wouldn't even be the highest in the NBA.   Next season if the Warriors do not resign Kelly Oubre or Kent Bazemore, they are at 168m.   The Nets if they do not retain Spencer Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, they are at 150m with 7 players on their roster."
*Spencer Dinwiddie has entered the chat*
"there's only so many of those teams, though, and he's competing with (i guess) reggie jackson, kyle lowry, spencer dinwiddie...."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
What is the point of involving OKC in what would otherwise be Thad Young for Spencer Dinwiddie? Did I read that wrong?
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"
Don't forget Jeff Green and Spencer Dinwiddie
"That’s interesting. So its 2 yr deal with LAC vs above the cap (non taxpayer) teams who can offer the full MLEx3yr and under the cap teams.  Alex Caruso is 27 with 4 year of NBA miles, RJ is 31 with 10 years. I see Caruso getting looks at the MLE range, maybe even an offer for $1-2 mill above MLE but looking below, it becomes unlikely and he instead see offers from other teams operating above the cap for full MLE.  To get a contract above MLE for RJ, half the league is able to do it: NYK, SAS, OKC, MIA, CHA, DAL, MEM, TOR, NWO, CLE, HOU, ATL, CHI, SAC, ORL, DET.  Looking at those teams, does RJ get a $12-15 mill offer from DET, ORL, SAC, CHI, ATL, HOU, CLE, NWO, TOR, CHA, OKC that would pry him from LA...I don’t think any of these teams make a real play for RJ as they already have their own guards and may not want to throw $50-60 mill for someone to be their 3rd guard in most cases. CHI could offer their entire cap space ($13-15) for him to be their 3rd guard if they want to compound it to show Zach they want to win 🤷‍♂️ but I think they have other targets.  Realistically, the only teams that chase are NYK, MIA, DAL...could include SAS MEM but they both have young guards and SAS cap space could get eaten by resigning free agents (Mills, Gay, DeRozan). RJ also has to contend with other PG Free agents:  Spencer Dinwiddie 28 Lonzo Ball 23 Derrick Rose 32 Patty Mills 32 Kyle Lowry 35 (Other PG unlikely to switch teams - cp3 and conley).  For the above the cap (but below tax payer bracket) teams: PHI, PHX (CP3 opts out and inks a $90 mill 3 yr deal), BOS, DEN, WSH, LAL, and IND...I only see PHI or IND making a play for him at full MLE to fill a big need.  Based on this, I think there is a good chance RJ sticks with LAC for that $10 mill/yr (for 2 years) that they can offer him. Unless PHI or IND enter the picture. Like Marks said, it’ll be an interesting free agency!"
Spencer Dinwiddie because he’s so damn weird
"He has. Though if Spencer Dinwiddie is healthy enough to play, I would argue he's better  Canada is King of the What ifs to the point that we should stop talking about it until it actually happens. We've been hearing how great Canada can be since 2015 and they made one major event in that time and it would have taken real effort on their part to miss it."
"Perfect and most realistic IMO: sign one of Spencer Dinwiddie, Lonzo Ball, or Devotne Graham on a medium sized deal. Have a decent prospect fall to us in round 2 pick 38, someone who can immediately contribute. Sign and trade markkanen to get something for him. Keep Theis, Temple, Green. Waive Arcidiacano, sign a forward and a 3 and D wing. Furkan Korkmaz or Tony snell. Also should be interested in Bryn Forbes"
"Jerami Grant $19,047,000  Marcus Smart $13,446,000  Christian Wood $13,015,000  Spencer Dinwiddie $11,454,000  DeAndre Hunter $7,422,000  Succeeding is all relative obviously when you make the rule no all stars you can the ceiling at 5-6 seed type range."

"Not winning this year meant that LeVert and Allen (and LaMarcus Aldridge, and potentially Spencer Dinwiddie) don't get rings as members of the Nets 🥺 the saddest development of being eliminated"
"Ben Simmons for Spencer Dinwiddie (S&amp;T), Joe Harris and Claxton"
"So what? Based on your logic if you’re a good shooter you should always shoot well from 3 regardless of context and regardless of circumstance. Also it’s easy to say he has good mechanics now that hes shooting well on a different team, nobody was saying that prior to him going to GS. Truth is that shot quality matters, and Wiggins had dramatically better shot quality in GSW  Because joe Harris is a pure shooter? I just told you not all players are the same  Btw dinwidde was actually a strong shot maker in the year 2019( the only playoff team hes gotten real minutes on)  https://www.bball-index.com/spencer-dinwiddie-is-an-absolute-bargain/  He cooled down at the end of the season but then picked it right back up in the playoffs where he shot 38% on 5 threes a game"
"So the only season Dinwidde actually played on a good team the was tearing it up from the 3 point line for about 4 [months](https://www.bball-index.com/spencer-dinwiddie-is-an-absolute-bargain/) he did come back down by the end of the season but he immediately picked up the slack in the only playoff series hes ever played in, he shot 38% from 3 on nearly 5 attempts a game vs an elite defensive team in Philly   So that does indicate 3 point ability   Again this is the only season he ever played on a good team, and he was likely getting better opportunities and shot quality due to the emergence of Dlo and Caris Levert.   Swap that with Lebron and AD   Anyways i was curious about his shot quality data and i tweeted cranjis( analytics guy) asking if he can give it to me from bballindex. Just waiting on a response"

Nets fans outta control comparing Spencer Dinwiddie to DBook
"I hope we re-sign him. Would be such great injury insurance for our guards. Obviously didn't work out this year but you gotta think that your 1-3 best guards going down won't happen again (Harden, Kyrie, and Spencer). Feel like that's a bit of a missing part of the story because Dinwiddie has been injured the whole year, but he would have been massive to have in the bucks series with a half legged harden and kyrie on the bench."
"Except the Suns won game 1 against the Lakers with no CP3 and the Lakers at full roster so idk about how ""ez"" that first round loss would have been. I also think its hilarious that you use injuries helping them out against them while rooting for the Bucks. They squeaked out a win in OT of game 7 and the Nets essentially had 1 of their big 3 playing and no Spencer Dinwiddie. At least the Suns have taken advantage and looked dominate against their weakened opponents."
"Sure, if you ignore Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert and Spencer Dinwiddie. Asume the Harden trade is never even made and Brooklyn beats the Bucks if they have Allen and LeVert, even if Dinwiddie and Kyrie are hurt. And would for better or worse be favored over Atlanta. But the trade did happen, and KD Kyrie and Harden are likely going to be title favorites for years to come"
"Joe Harris, or Spencer Dinwiddie in a S+T"
Did you say max contract for Spencer Dinwiddie?
Spencer dinwiddie
&gt; Can you list the players who had an ACL and came back just as good?  Spencer Dinwiddie for one seeing as he tore his ACL before.
Losing spencer dinwiddie in the beginning of the season really hurt them in the playoffs. His scoring off the bench and filling in for kyrie would have been huge
"Probably, if Harden had a Grade 2 hamstring tear that's such a big risk and playing more definitely would've increased the risk of reaggravation, plus Kyrie may be rushed back too early, his injury looked like a high ankle sprain  I know other teams have also been hit hard by the injury bug, but damn...Spencer Dinwiddie could've been a huge help and then LMA having heart issues forcing him to retire. Can't get sucked into the ""what ifs"" though, just gotta regroup and use the time off to heal properly and recover"
You mean 2021-22 Lakers starting PG Spencer Dinwiddie?
I get hating Harden/Kyrie/Blake and even Joe Harris. Jeff Green and Spencer Dinwiddie are cool. Bruce Brown’s hustle is respectable too. The rest of the role players just don’t get enough exposure to hate lol
"I meant Bucks are the only team in the playoffs with a 100% healthy Big Three.   I’d consider the Nets as 100% vs. the Celtics, even tho they dont have Spencer Dinwiddie."
Jeff Green and Mike James and Spencer Dinwiddie. Jarret Allen and Caris Levert were also super likeable during their nets stints.
Spencer Dinwiddie is still on the Nets…for now.
Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris for Simmons and a 2nd round pick
"Maybe.   But KD, Harden, and Kyrie will be a year older. THere's no guarantee that they'll keep Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green or Spencer Dinwiddie.   They're deep into the tax without spending a dime on any of those guys or their replacements."
"I wonder what Caris LeVert, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jarrett Allen, and all the other Nets who were traded away for this super team are thinking now."
"Um did you miss what Kenny Atkinson did in Brooklyn?  He took Spencer Dinwiddie from g league player to borderline all star, he turned that Nets franchise around, they should've been a lotto team."
Lakers/Bucks/Sixers/Wizards to see spencer dinwiddie back on the floor again and against us  Honestly I’m really hyped about playing the Lakers mostly
"The others just aren't talked about much. There's lots of guys that you just shrug and say ""seems fine...""  Will Barton, Alec Burks, Alex Caruso, Khem Birch, Torrey Craig, Gorgui Deng, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte Graham, JaMychal Green, Furkan Korkmaz"
"Ya the wizards have gotten Spencer Dinwiddie and the Celtics got Al Horford, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward and hell even Kyrie had Boston on his list in the last 7 years. What are you even talking about man. And lmfao at Tatum coming to DC. Also, Brad has been great this offseason. Let’s see what happens tho."
"That's kinda what Spencer Dinwiddie wanted. Imagine investing in a Lebron coin, back when he was in high school. Woulda been a way for talent to get compensated and encouraged, as capitalism evolves towards funding individuals instead of just businesses. And people woulda made some sick returns.  IDK when people would sell that shit tho lol."
"&gt;On Nov. 14—two months before the trade was officially announced—early talks between Houston and Brooklyn included Harden for Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen. The picks weren't finalized at that point, but a verbal agreement was made, according to sources close to Harden and Durant. (A Nets spokesperson denies a verbal agreement was made at that time.) Harden and Durant believed the deal was done and celebrated the occasion together.  &gt;By Nov. 17, news of the potential deal had spread across the league. Harden and Durant thought it would be finalized on Nov. 22, when trades could officially be announced. But Rockets management changed its tune. Harden, Durant and the Nets had underestimated the Rockets' capacity to posture for a better deal.  &gt;""Houston was being difficult,"" a front-office executive familiar with the Rockets' negotiating tactics at the time told Bleacher Report.  Ah yes I'm sure Harden and KD celebrated the trade based off of nothing. Fuck outta here"
"No idea. I'm not saying he sucks and has never contributed to any winning, ever. I do think that if you replaced him on most of his teams with, say, prime Spencer Dinwiddie, they'd probably have more success."

They are both great I’m just not actively upset that spencer dinwiddie isn’t a Knick.
There is no excuse. Im not tripping over not having spencer dinwiddie on my team 😂
Nets didn’t have Spencer dinwiddie or Jeff green. Not sure what your point is.
[Berman] Does spencer Dinwiddie hate puppies and kittens?
"**This** guy gets it. Beal knows our franchise will pay him a huge contract in October which he has been working towards for a fair few years.  He actively recruited Spencer Dinwiddie and has had a hand in pretty much every trade/signing that has happened recently.

RJ Barrett  Malik Monk  Cole Anthony  Kevin Huerter  Rui Hachimura  Christian Wood  Keldon Johnson  Justise Winslow  Pat Connaughton  Malcolm Brogdon  Anfernee Simons  Spencer Dinwiddie  Immanuel Quickley
Spencer Dinwiddie is considered overrated and his stats don't look good but if you watched him play you know he can be an all star. I do think Wizards can make playoffs as 7th or 8th seed.
Would it be a stretch to say Spencer Dinwiddie
Point guards in this era probably. Guys like Spencer dinwiddie averaged 20-6 and most people wouldn’t have even considered him a top 10 point guard. But yeah that’s a pretty impressive list
Spencer Dinwiddie and Simmons getting paid nearly the same amount would be weird. Ben would’ve been traded immediately after the Hawks series if that was his salary.

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

Spencer Dinwiddie Avengers Menace confirmed
"Look I'm not saying he deserved that $84M or that he's not dumb for turning down that money. But the way this free agency has shaken out as been bizarre and extremely unlucky for him. Spencer Dinwiddie is (IMO) not even a better player than Schroeder, and he's getting paid OVER THREE TIMES as much as him.  This reminds me of when the entire league randomly froze out Brook Lopez in 2018 and the Bucks got him on a minimum."
"Ask Spencer Dinwiddie, he should know what to do."
"Hello police, Spencer Dinwiddie trynna to beat me up!"
In part?  The reason he didn’t play is because he had Covid and the Nets told him not to go?  He even said he was keen to play?

"I don't know if Pau Gasol counts (don't think he officially retired yet), but he was in med school to become a doctor.   Would have Spencer Dinwiddie high on the list, too."

"To be honest, the move *probably* works on most teams in the NBA. Most teams aren’t able to turn around and get Westbrook plus a bunch of solid guys on the min. Not quite the same contract, but Marcus Morris was able to pull together 4/64 from the Clippers, they were over the cap, had his bird rights, and either had to pay up or lose him for nothing. Tristan Thompson and JR Smith with the Cavs as well. Schroder assumed ‘lose me for nothing’ was enough leverage to be a no go for a title contending team. I feel like he could have pulled a Spencer Dinwiddie contract somewhere if he saw the writing on the wall early enough."
Interesting. Dinwiddie scored slightly more points but Schroder was far more efficient and also played significantly better defense. I'd give the playmaking edge to Dinwiddie but I'm not sure it's enough to make up for everything else.   I just think Dennis did a lot more for his team than Spencer. The 3 guard lineup that OKC had was extremely dangerous thanks to his play.
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
"The biggest piece of it all is, who, Spencer Dinwiddie?"
I still don't get why spencer dinwiddie is a highlight signing this offseason lmao
Well it would be a little bit weird if only one of Spencer or Dinwiddie ended up with the Wizards

"Tommy is looking at moving Hutchinson and 2nd Round pick to clear enough room to get him signed. Hutch is on $4,019,459.  Westbrook’s outgoing salary is: $44,211,146  Hutchinson: $4,019,459  Wizards incoming salaries based on Spotrac  Dinwiddie: $19,047,619 **estimate**  KCP: $13,038,062  Kuzma: $13,000,000  Harrell: $9,720,900  Holiday: $3,980,551  So not far off at all.  Btw, Spencer just took photos at Capital One Arena.  He wouldn’t turn up to the Wizards arena to do Wizards press related stuff if he wasn’t 1000% going to DC.  Deal must be happening soon!"
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
"Except Dinwiddie before he got hurt was a better player.  Bigger, better passer, more consistent. Plus he WANTS to play with Beal.  Only reason they are comparable is cause Spencer got hurt."

A potential Spencer Dinwiddie deal
"Dinwiddie always struck me more of a score-first/volume-scorer person than Schroder, so it might depend on the team situation. Defensive rating also leans slightly in favor of Schroder (OKC + LAL vs dinwidde on the nets); that might be in part due to the team defense, but I'd say Schroder is better defensively  Before the kd/kyrie/harden were playing, iirc dinwiddie was definitely taking a lot of shots and usually the guy holding the ball most of the time. Actually, at this time it looks like dinwiddie averaged more assists than schroder -- maybe confounded by a higher usg rate. Then the big question was how dinwiddie would fit with other high-volume scorers (and caris was coming into his own as well). When the nets big 3 arrived, dinwiddie got injured, so it was hard to really make an assessment.  Schroder on OKC -- he played pretty well in that SGA-CP3-schroder lineup without being super ball dominant. So that makes me think Schroder can coexist along other scorers. On the lakers, his FGA dropped a little bit; tbh I think it probably would have dropped more if the lakers were healthy with lebron/AD. His assists also looked better than in prior seasons.

If the best you can do is Devonte Graham and Spencer Dinwiddie then Zion is leaving.
"You’re not getting Beal for Spencer Dinwiddie lol, Beal goes for basically 2 Colin Sexton level players or a ton of picks"
Lonzo is 23 and Dinwiddie is 28. Impact wise they’re already in the same same boat but Zo has much more room to grow than Spencer does
Imagine having a sweepstakes for Spencer Dinwiddie
"Where are Spencer Dinwiddie and Reggie Jackson going? Also, doesn't it seem crazy that Schroder could get $20 million when Cameron Payne is apparently only getting $6 million? I'm really amazed that anyone thinks this highly of Schroder."
Marcus Smart for Spencer Dinwiddie in a sign and trade. Who says no?
Spencer Dinwiddie wishes he had the self esteem Dennis Schröder has.
"So he has offers for 3 years with an AAV of $22M, roughly $66M over 3 years.  But he wants a contract 2 years longer from the Nets (says 5 vs 4), with close to 2x the $ on the table.  Good luck Dinwiddie.  Spencer Dinwiddie is making it harder to sign him, than what the Nets did to sign Durant and Irving.  Amazing."
What world are we living in where Spencer Dinwiddie coming off a season ending ACL injury can get a max contract from someone?
I wish I had the self-esteem Spencer Dinwiddie has.
can't you only have 1 or 2 5 year deals signed at once?   also the idea of giving Spencer dinwiddie a max is nuts to me
Spencer Dinwiddie
May I interest you in one slightly used Spencer Dinwiddie?
Feels like just signing Spencer Dinwiddie would be a lot easier.
"- Lowry will join Heat  - Kawhi will resign with Clippers  - Conley will go back to Jazz  - CP back to Suns  - Melo goes to Lakers   - Lonzo either resigns with Pelicans or goes to Bulls as rumoured  - Schroeder goes to Knicks  - Spencer Dinwiddie joins Wizards  - Derozan goes to Dallas/Knicks    Couple of other stuff I expect to happen are Portland does some weird trades, Ben Simmons stays put in Philly for the time being and Spurs sign all sorts of random players."
Lonzo - 25M  Spencer Dinwiddie - 20  Conley - 25  just to name a few. I’m even cool having to slightly overpay as it leaves us with more flexibility than a washed up player on a 1 year contract. I love when people try to tell me about my own team as if they inherently know better despite not watching half of our games.  FOH.
"Will he? Those aren't the only point guards who will be available. Is Schroder considered next up over guys like Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne and Spencer Dinwiddie? I think the market may be very thin for Schroder. But if teams are really targeting him, doesn't that make a sign and trade more likely? I'm not sure which teams want to blow a bunch of cap space on Schroder."
"Don’t think Dinwiddie does much for them, but I’m also confused as to what the Wizards are doing. Probably a lottery team next year if Spencer is their only big addition."
"Isn't Harris   1. A better defender 2. A similar shooter 3. Cheaper  Why would the Nets do this? If you want to do something like this, try a sign and trade with Kings for Spencer Dinwiddie"
"Dont forget Luke Kennard right before D Mitchell. And the sleeper bullshit, the one good pick he made - Spencer Dinwiddie in the 2nd round, he immediately gave up on quick and shipped out for nothing."
Half of this thread will be trying to figure out if they want to make a Ben Simmons joke or a Spencer Dinwiddie joke.
"No he doesn’t.  He just didn’t want to go play a healthy Boston borderline superteam with Hayward, Kemba, Tatum, Brown (2 all stars and 2 bl all stars last year) while his best teammate was spencer dinwiddie.   I wouldn’t have showed up either."
"I was trying to give you the benefit of a doubt, but maybe your brain isn't a good asset. You saying it was ""obvious"" about the bubble a year ago is bullshit. The bubble was extremely experimental and most people thought it wouldn't be successful enough to finish the Playoffs. Compared to now,, no one knew anything about covid, and everyone was scared of the ramifications of getting it.     Bradley Beal, Davis Bertans, DeAndre Jordan, and Spencer Dinwiddie all sat out the bubble. And guess what, they're all on teams. So I have no clue where you're getting this ""people don't want him because he wasn't in the bubble"" nonsense.     **The guy isn't as good as he used to be**. That's the only reason teams need not to sign him. But its weird you seem so hellbent on making it about covid."
You turned him into Spencer Dinwiddie.
"He has to be the favorite for MIP right?  I could also see Wendell Carter, Spencer Dinwiddie, Miles Bridges, and Cam Reddish winning."
Spencer Dinwiddie going off to get those incentives
"Stop reading at ""Giannis made a reckless play"", boohoo he went for a rebound. And yall are starting to sound like Spencer Dinwiddie with all these made up, fictional scenarios in which the Bucks don't win. Guess what, kid? We won, got that ring and Bud was extended. Accept reality and stop making these dumbass posts."
Ehh we will see. Y’all run a lot of dribble handoffs and pnr that will benefit your role players and stars so maybe you won’t need a big brain offensive guy idk.   The more I think about it the sadder I am that we didn’t pay Spencer Dinwiddie and we are going to just run point forward ball again ugh…
"Nah, I’m pretty sure he shot 76% on a stats loophole: Either he dunked the lob or bungled things so badly, it counted as a turnover for the passer.  Ask poor Spencer Dinwiddie, who spent the whole 2019-20 season lofting balls Jarrett Allen (or Javale McGee) could have yammed in his sleep, only to watch DJ not even jump if there was any obstacle in his way. Harden’s Lebron-level passing made some headway, but he was so openly infuriated at a DJ’s defensive apathy, his arrival was what finally gave Nash to clout to bench him for good.  He’ll definitely be a less dour bench cheerleader than Gasol though. At least when cameras are on."
"If Spencer Dinwiddie were a Pokémon, he’s the next evolution of him."
Spencer Dinwiddie started making hypothetical situations as soon as the buck won the finals.
"very true, although some aren’t even offered a chance to prove themselves in the first place, some not at all and some not as substantially as they deserve, which confuses me. Like for example w/ Justin Patton he definitely seemed like he belongs in my opinion but just never got a chance since he got injured. And then some guys in college ball out n have mad potential but don’t get a chance until later on or not at all. Think Christian Wood, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Ish Smith"
Spencer P Diddy Dinwiddie.. jk
I remember Spencer Dinwiddie lame ass was hating on this play.
"Do you like their chances? They finished one game above 10th last season. Currently projecting to be 11th in the East, 21st overall.

"So reading this comment made me curious what kind of fit I could find for ben. Booted up 2k and started a new myleague season.   (Disclaimer: the roster I used was from around the trade deadline I think so obv this wouldn't be viable at all rn.)   I made a 3 team trade between Nuggets, 76ers, Nets.  Denver receives: Ben Simmons  76ers receive: Aaron Gordon, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nuggets 1st round 2023, Nuggets 2nd round 2023  Nets Receive: Paul Millsap, Nuggets 1st round 2025, Nuggets 2nd round 2022  Denver: &gt;Give up Gordon and Millsap but get Ben Simmons who is switched to the 4 to play alongside Jokic. I think Simmons could end up being a younger better Aaron Gordon for the Nuggets if he's playing out of the 4.   76ers:  &gt;No longer have Ben crowding the paint at PG. Get Aaron Gordon to basically do what ben did for cheaper and he doesn't have to also be your guard. Spencer Dinwiddie becomes the starting point and can actually space the floor and handle the ball to take pressure off Embiid.   Nets:  &gt;Give up Dinwiddie but they already had Harden and Irving so didn't really need him all **that** much. End up getting Millsap just like IRL and some future draft picks to either flip for more vets or bolster their roster in a few years as their vets begin to age out.   So what do you think? Honestly I think it worked out not so bad for all 3 teams. I'm gonna sim the season out to see how they end up."
It wouldn't be the first time a player the Pistons dumped ended up being a good pick up for the Nets. See Spencer Dinwiddie and Bruce Brown.
Something Khris Middleton… something something Spencer Dinwiddie
Spencer Dinwiddie
"KCP, Kuzma, Harrell, Spencer Dinwiddie &gt; Westbrook for the Wizards.  They also got Aaron Holiday out of the deal."
nets didnt have spencer dinwiddie? And jeff green was back in teh second half of that series is why i mentioned him. he wasnt there and we were still beting them without kyrie.
"Spencer Dinwiddie, probably?"
"Yeah if Spencer Dinwiddie is back to his old self, you can argue that this roster is better than last year."
"And for Spencer Dinwiddie being a Net. Dude was all over recruiting Kyrie and then he just forgotten then pushed out.   Dude at least is getting paid by the Wizards, Jordan was meant to be part of a super friends big three with Kyrie and Kevin, but then he is gonna get shafted."
"so why arent we including spencer dinwiddie and jeff green missing half the series? Also if you think harden in games 5-7 was even 50%$ of his normal capabilities you didnt even wsatch anything.   Donte is an important player for the bucks but hes their 5th best player. Thats why he isnt getting mentioned. its not comparable to stars geting hurt.   And yeah the bucks got lucky, but so did the suns. so why cant we give the suns credit for making the finals?"
"Lowry and Lonzo signed immediately when free agency opened lol. There are no reports of Brad meeting with them because A. That would be tampering and B. They signed as soon as FA started. Doesn’t mean they weren’t after them.   As for Smart, I’ll just point to his below average TS% percentage every year except 2018-19, when he was exactly league average. Or perhaps I can point to his OBPM, which has never even been a *positive* ranking. Meaning he has never once offensively been average in OBPM.   https://985thesportshub.com/2021/07/30/report-celtics-showing-interest-in-free-agent-lonzo-ball/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nba-rumors-celtics-have-interest-free-agent-spencer-dinwiddie%3famp  And here are your sources. Unless you’re calling Shams and Chris Mannix boldfaced liars, the Celtics were interested in point guards this off-season."
Pistons  1. Derrick Rose  2. Blake Griffin 3. Khris Middleton  4. Tobias Harris 5. Spencer Dinwiddie   Bench: Reggie Jackson
11. LaMelo Ball 12. Mike Conley 13. Fred VanVleet 14. Malcolm Brogdon 15. Lonzo Ball 16. Kyle Lowry 17. D'Angelo Russell 18. Spencer Dinwiddie 19. Kemba Walker 20. Terry Rozier 21. Derrick Rose 22. Dejounte Murray  EDIT: I swear I wrote out 11-22 numbers but reddit doesn't like starting lists at 11?
"Lmao I guess I’m being a dick at this point, but if you actually knew about advanced metrics, you’d know there’s no good way to measure defense. Harden is not a good defender by any means but do you see the names at the top of that list? You’re trying to tell me Spencer Dinwiddie is the best defensive player in the league? That whole list is flawed. I watched every Russ game last season and I can tell you he is a bad defender."
"That same channel posted a Spencer Dinwiddie vs. Nickeil Alexander-Walker workout yesterday, and they have a ton more on their channel from previous off seasons."
"Not enough history. I've been in Brooklyn longer than the Nets have, and the questionable roster-building, (mostly big-name trades/FA) disconnection with ownership, somewhat mediocre product (outside of KD's seasons, we haven't really been close to being good)  and then there's the Knicks. The Knicks are beloved, because of their history.  I love the Nets, because they moved here around the same time I moved to BK, and the tickets were DIRT cheap post-KG/Paul Pierce. I remember buying games for like 7 dollars to see Spencer Dinwiddie take 20 shots a game."
"Spencer Dinwiddie continues to amaze me. The amount of depth our team has on paper is startling. Very happy with the win, as the C’s are the team we’re likely to match up with again for the play in, maybe even Charlotte or Chicago. Who knows. Amazing start to a season."
Having Spencer Dinwiddie is such a nice addition. Beal continues to struggle at executing the fourth quarter offense and Dinwiddie has been amazing about just taking the ball away from him and finishing the game.

"Spencer Dinwiddie and Dlo. But besides former Nets, Ill go with Jokic"
Spencer Dinwiddie revenge game
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."
Im ready for the Spencer Dinwiddie revenge game
"I walked past Wilson Chandler and Spencer Dinwiddie on the UCLA campus once, they were walking to the parking lot after practicing at the Student Activities Center. I think most NBA teams practice at SAC when they play the Clips and Lakers. It's hard to catch the players though because they're obviously closed practices and they shuffle them out of there pretty quickly. I just happened to use the same parking lot as them lol"
"Spencer Dinwiddie, Denis Smith Jr, Evan Fournier"
Spencer Dinwiddie will be a star
Also 2 games.  Both could be right .  But still 2 games.  The Lakers will figure things out even if they play worse with Westbrook on floor than off.  Also Spencer Dinwiddie is good and I've been saying it for years.  He's a high level point guard.

Spencer Dinwiddie
"Lol bro Wizards are just a deep team man with Spencer Dinwiddie, Kuzma, Harrell, etc.  Westbrook was starting with Raul Neto at SF and Alex Len at Center.   Gafford was an extremely late acquisition that didn't even start.  I'd say the Wiz now have a real team with depth where the starting 5 are pretty legit.   Wizards didn't need guys like John Wall and Westbrook taking up $45 million of salary. Spreading it across Kuzma, Harrell, Dinwiddie were the right moves."
Spencer Dinwiddie says he puts 2-3 hours in a day just shooting in his AMA which gives a rough idea

"Might end up being a win-win trade.   But getting multiple good players for a team with no depth is a win. Especially considering Dinwiddie fills most of the void left by Westbrook.

"He has poor work ethic and has not improved his game.  He is immature and acts like a child.  But his coach threw him under the bus and Embiid (who played like trash in Game 7 and different games during that series - although being injured) also directly blamed him for the loss.  When your head coach and top player publicly take a shit on your face who the fuck would want to go back and play for that team again?  High schoolers would quit in that situation.  This guy is making 30+ milllion dollars a year you can not expect him to want to keep playing under Rivers (the king of blowing 3-1 losses) and Embiid, who publicly trashed him after game 7 and who hasnt had a good relationship with him to begin with.  On top of all that he was shopped multiple times, before and during Harden's availability.   Sixers organization, Rivers, and Embiid all took a dump on Simmons and people are acting like he just out of the blue is doing this shit.  The real person to blame in all of this is the ownership and Morey.  They knew this was going to be a problem, they knew that after the botched Harden trade and especially after game 7 and even more so after Simmons said he never wanted to be in a Sixers uniform again.  But Morey being the arrogant prick he is, decided to ask for absurd amount of trade value back for Simmons and here we are.  He could have had Brogdon or CJ and maybe some other role players.  Instead we now have unnecessary drama, distractions when the season hasnt even started, and just stupid shit that the hard working players in the Sixers organization do not need to deal with.  Morey needed to trade him a month ago - and while Simmons is acting like a little bitch - this whole debacle falls on Morey.  Now Morey is the one who is going to get embarrassed and fleeced in a trade.  The funniest rumor i read last week was that the Sixers wouldnt even entertain a trade for Kyrie. The Nets are laughing hard right now because the Sixers would be lucky to get someone like Spencer Dinwiddie in return for Simmons"
"I agree with you, but our team really had no picks or leverage whatsoever after the Pierce/Garnett trade, it was only a miracle that we got the misfit gems like D'Angelo Russell, Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, then got late guys like LeVert and Allen  As much as it pains me to say, I don't see that team being serious contenders even at all of their peaks...the Nets may have sold their soul to the devil but were *historically* bad in the early-mid 2010s"
"I mean they both have punchable faces. But if you want me to list non-white guys, I’d punch CJ McCollum, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Chris Paul"
"Dude I just replied to that 7 year old thread before seen the dates, lol. Here I was wondering why they used 2012 as a cutoff year.   2014 obviously has to be included because of Jokic:   Jokic, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jordan Clarkson."

"I don't mind the top half of the list. But I have a few problem with the logic they used for some of the guys down lower. For example, they used TJ Warren and Jusuf Nurkics injuries as a reason to place them at 99 and 93 respectively, but Spencer Dinwiddie, who too missed all of last season is at 68.

Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
Pretty excited to see Spencer Dinwiddie gear up for DC this year. I feel like he and Beal (don’t get me started) might really compliment each other’s play styles. Hoping he has a great bounce back season.
Mate it’s Spencer Dinwiddie not Lebron James
Harvard [was his backup school](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.netsdaily.com/platform/amp/2018/9/11/17848212/spencer-dinwiddie-finally-matriculates-at-harvard)
"I don't get the big deal here? Man says the same thing all basketball fans say about Beal to Beal. Big whoop.  If you think Brad Beal, Kuzma, and Spencer Dinwiddie are that much of an upgrade, then good luck."
"Ohhhh, Dinwiddie. Sorry, but it just registered in my head that his first name is Spencer, despite hearing it all the time"
"Spencer Dinwiddie is a PG for the Wizards, he’s most commonly known in NBA circles for being a crypto guy, he’s doing ok this season i guess? but nowhere near All Star level"
"Winning championships is not about who can spend the most. In many years the teams with the highest payrolls are not very good, in fact. When the Lakers won last year they weren't in the tax at all.   Every team makes cost cutting moves. The Warriors didn't use the MLE this summer. The Clippers dumped Beverley and Rondo to save tax money. The Nets elected to not bring back Spencer Dinwiddie just to save money. The Bucks didn't re-sign PJ Tucker. Those owners are all worth many, many times what the Lakers' owners are worth, yet for some reason the Lakers seem to be the only team that catches flack for not just spending the most they possibly could have. Why is that?"
Spencer Dinwiddie did that in ATL for us. Legend.
"the interpretation is that defensive stats are highly variable and 17-20 games aren't necessarily a good enough sample size for something like opposing FG%, which has a lot of variables that don't get context.  Like LaMelo being on the good list here is highly interesting, because he's largely a bad defender when he's not getting steals off lazy passes. Then I remember that number is propped up by Spencer Dinwiddie just being ridiculously cold, going something like 1-20 from the field in two games against us. Games like that really make 17 game sample sizes of defensive stats fairly useless except on the absolute extremes."

Happened with Spencer Dinwiddie when Washington wanted to sign him
"Smh. Bum ass Spencer Dinwiddie was supposed to supply the other 13 points for Washington, he should’ve stayed in Brooklyn."
That's the point a Triple double guy numbers can be replaced with higher success with Spencer Dinwiddie....   A 35 year old cp3 can replace westbrook and  win more  then both seasons he did without durant on the thunder.   Westbrook hasn't ever shown he makes a team better.  The wizards only sucked is because John wall was hurt and stuck with his cap. Plus they had a losing record the year westbrook led team.  Where does he make teams better ????
Spencer Dinwiddie should be sponsored by Wolf Cola  I hear it's popular in Boca Raton
"&gt;From that, we were able to become a playoff team with major cap flexibility - what other teams are capable of that?  In that East? lol you could make the playoffs with a 0.450 record or something. Again, having cap space could never get a smaller market FAs. Dunno why you keep repeating that like that was the key to creating a superteam. We made the ECF 3 years back and have Giannis, still couldn't get a top 15 FA to sign with us.   I don't wanna read about Dinwiddie again. You're just lying to yourselves if you think KD and Kyrie signing there has anything to do with someone named Spencer.  &gt;it's pathetic as hell to not give credit to the FO for digging us out of the worst situation in NBA history for any organization  Normal teams don't go from that situation to a superteam that fast. The reason you did is NYC. Not your FO. And if you don't wanna admit it, answer this:  How many top 15 players changed teams in the last 5 seasons? Where do they play?"
"No, additional good moves like signing the highest percentage three point shooter off the end of Cleveland’s bench. Or like signing Spencer Dinwiddie, who put up 20 and 7 for us, out of the G League. Or drafting Jarrett Allen in the back of the first round who’s now on a $100 million contract. See but you purposely ignore those things because they don’t fit your narrative. Further proving that you’re arguing in bad faith.   You want to make it seem like the Bucks are some genius front office when I could easily just make the same bad faith argument that they lucked into Giannis in the draft and have been riding his coattails for the last half decade. It’s not like they knew he was going to be some superstar talent. If you had a higher pick in the draft that year you would have chose someone else.   But at this point it’s clear you just want to stay mad and discredit teams in bigger markets. You can do that, but don’t be surprised when people call it out for being bullshit"
"No. We had no picks, and Sean marks picked up quality players who were looking to be journey men in Joe Harris and Spencer dinwiddie(currently a max player now) made a trade for Dlo(max player)who helped him turn it around after that Lakers fiasco)and he admitted our franchise changed his life)  when we did draft, we drafted Jarrett allen(Max in Cleveland) and picked up Caris Levert Rights via trade And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD. 5 Nets players from that Kenny Atkinson era combined are have 100+ million a year contracts now.  Furthermore, Kobe Bryant said he didn’t even want to be drafted here  Nets lost their franchise player in a car accident years ago  Stephon Marbury once wrote on his sneakers “I’m all alone” when he was with the nets  We went to back to back finals and still don’t have a big fan base, as you saw the other night with Steph curry and the warriors were in Barclays  Stop acting like the Nets have been anything short of the Clippers East. This franchise has been through it. You small market teams are  becoming annoying with the big market talk, yes being in New York helps, tell me how that has worked for the Knicks or the nets prior to 2019 when both were in the dumpster or mediocre at best? With maybe one good season the past decade for the Knicks? Both laughing stocks."
"No. We had no picks, and Sean marks picked up quality players who were looking to be journey men in Joe Harris and Spencer dinwiddie(currently a max player now) made a trade for Dlo(max player now only after his stint in Brooklyn) when we did draft, we drafted Jarrett allen(Max in Cleveland) and Caris Levert And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD  Furthermore, Kobe Bryant said he didn’t even want to be drafted here  Nets lost their franchise player in a car accident years ago   Stephon Marbury once wrote on his sneakers “I’m all alone” when he was with the nets  Stop acting like the Nets have been anything short of the Clippers East.

"That was a **great** move.  We traded Wall who hadn’t played in 2 seasons for Russ.  Russ got his stock at a premium again by getting us to the Playoffs and going on a tear.  **We then traded Russ for and get this, there’s a list :)**  **Spencer Dinwiddie (huge ACL comeback season)**  **Montrezl Harrell (current 6MOTY candidate)**  **Kyle Kuzma (improved in pts, reb, assist, steals, blks)**  **KCP (still playing elite defense)**  **Pick 22 in 2021 Draft… that was then on traded for Aaron Holiday and Pick 31 which was Isaiah Todd**  So in total the Wiz built a totally new squad and the Lakers took on Russ and his ridiculously terrible contract…**did I mention that he has a Player Option for next year LOL**  If we win 50 games, Tommy Sheppard is Executive of the Year."
"&gt;Spencer Dinwiddie, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, KCP and a 1st Round Pick  &gt;I think it was worth it for us  No need to be humble, you guys fleeced everyone!"
"We turned broken John Wall who hadn’t played in nearly 2 years into Russ who got us to the playoffs and upped his value.  Then used that to get Spencer Dinwiddie, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, KCP and a 1st Round Pick (traded that for Aaron Holiday and slightly later pick Isaiah Todd)  I think it was worth it for us cause he got us to where we are now lol"
Spencer Dinwiddie has a Naruto PFP. Lmao but cool as well.
Also Spencer Dinwiddie: A REAL no-look pass would require you to be blindfolded as soon as you walked into the arena /sarcasm
Spencer dinwiddie promised to buy him one but never delivered
"At pg, the combination of dribbling and speed, i would go with Steph Curry, Trae Young, Fox,  First Step Spencer Dinwiddie   Impressive ""bigs"" for me are Draymond Green in Fastbreaks and KD    Few years back i will go with Prime Drose first step, Miami Lebron on the fastbreak and slashing mvp Westbrook"
"The Charlotte commentator at one point said: ""Spencer Dinwiddie is playing like Spencer Dawes."""
Anyone else hear Eric Collins say Spence Dinwiddie was playing like Spencer Hawes? 😆/🤣
"Spencer Dinwiddie is basically an on court coach. Hearing him talk he is very well spoken, very team oriented and knows a fair bit about Bitcoin so he’s no slouch when it comes to investments and money."
"...With the way coaching is going it's gotta be someone whom stars respect. As insane as this is, my guess for good coaches would be...  Rajon Rondo, Steph Curry, Seth Curry, Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Udonis Haslem, Spencer Dinwiddie, Fred Van Vleet, Lonzo Ball."
"they did lose spencer dinwiddie though, which I think is a big loss. That dude is good."
I mean just off the top of my head Spencer dinwiddie has a huge offensive rebound to ice the game the other day. A lot of guard rebounds are meaningless but some are pretty important
"You want insight? **I can give you INSIGHT**  Wizards are **3-0 when Bradley Beal hasn’t played this year.**  Over the course of those 3 games, Spencer Dinwiddie has averaged…  **28 PPG**  **7.3 RPG**  **8 APG**  **on nearly 50% from the field and 3pt land.**  Better?"
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"

Spencer Dinwiddie free agent pick up and we got got three good players in their primes from the Lakers for Westbrook and  two of them have championship experience. Deepest bench in the league and that's without Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant playing. Beal gets to score at all levels without the need to bail the team out all the time. Brooks is no longer the coach.
Spencer Dinwiddie.
Kyrie and Spencer Dinwiddie isn't half of a rotation buddy
Neither. He's from Spencer Dinwiddie
"Honestly too much to even fit in one post. Kuzma is really shining as a 3rd scoring option behind Beal and Dinwiddie, hell one could even argue he could be the 2nd scoring option. His defense is shining. We'll see if Bertans wakes up anytime soon and starts making 3s again, although I feel like we've seen some improvements with his off ball movement  So much development to keep track of too with a lot of young players to be excited about. Daniel Gaffords only 23, and when he got traded from the Bulls last season, that's when the Wizards defense really started honing in on a defensive presence in the paint. He plays super hard every minute too. Deni Avdija has been a huge surprise defensively as well, almost becoming our go to defender that can guard positions 1-5. He still has some work on the offensive side but I'm sure it'll come eventually, given his record in Tel Aviv.    And we still have Rui Hachimura who was also amazing last season on the defensive end, runs hard to finish at the rim, and developing a deadly mid-range game that can buy a bucket when we need it.   All of this new defense really opens it up for Thomas Bryant to bring his return too. A big knock on him has always been his defense, but if you have quality defenders in the 3 and 4 positions, and a long and tall Spencer Dinwiddie at PG, they can cover his gaps while he shoots from downtown and brings back his passion to the team.  Honestly there's just so much to be excited about with them this season."
"Well they turned Westbrook, Troy Brown Jr, Moe Wagner, and Chandler Hutchison into Spencer Dinwiddie, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, Aaron Holiday, Isaiah Todd, Daniel Gafford."
"We don’t need everyone to develop.  Poole already has emerged as a solid NBA piece and should only get better.  So that leaves Wiseman, Kuminga, and Moody.  If even one of them develops into an all-star quality player, then even as Curry, Klay, and Draymond age we should still be very strong as a team and franchise.    And considering how strong the Warriors dev team is, it only makes sense to bet that one or more of them will be solid pieces soon and that at least one will take a leap.  The Warriors went out of their way to get Dejan Milojevic (the coach who taught Jokic his footwork and postmoves), Kenny Atkinson (the coach who got Brooklyn back into the playoffs by developing guys like DLo, Caris Levert, Jaret Allen, and Spencer Dinwiddie), and Jama Mahlalela who helped develop Siakam, OG, and FVF.  That’s an all-star development team straight up."
"Joe Johnson seemingly alway torched us.  Same with Spencer Dinwiddie out of pure spite. And i dont blame him, was upset we got rid of him and still am to this day"
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."

"LaMelo's pre-draft comp was Spencer Dinwiddie lol and he's already exceeding that.  also LaMelo is definitely a better playmaker and passer, which for a point guard, matters much more than defense."
It’s a damn athletic play. Never seen that in a game or the Spencer Dinwiddie basket late in the game. A couple really strange plays and I’ve seen a lot of bball.
"They're winning because of Spencer Dinwiddie and, oddly enough, Montrezl Harrell.   Kuzma's raw stats look ok but that has mostly been due to the enormous number of minutes he's been playing."

"The Wizards this year are showing the full Russ experience this year. As soon as Russ left the team significantly improved, they now lost way less dumb ball, Spencer Dinwiddie are a far better complementary piece for Beal, and overall the stole 3 useful player for a washed-up bad fit Westbrook...   I expect them been easily in the playoffs this season and they will also compete for the second round, unlike last season."
"Sarver is just an example, I think *most* owners in the league wouldn't be comfortable spending $185 million (the highest ever recorded) in luxury tax. The Nets had bird rights on Spencer Dinwiddie, a good player who could've helped ensure a championship - but that would have been extremely expensive, so he went for picks and Nets dumped the Hutchison salary. Again, Lacob is literally paying the highest ever recorded Luxury Tax bill this season, while the team tries to develop young talent - it is extremely unusual."
"Tommy Shep turned an injury prone Wall on a Supermax into a redemption season Russell Westbrook on a Supermax into a career revival trade for Trez, Kuz and KCP not to mention using the left over money to get a now healthy Spencer Dinwiddie.

I'm going to be not mad but disappointed if Bradley Beal and Spencer Dinwiddie can co-exist at the same time and that's been the problem.
"the heat are interested in every free agent  i dont know how they will pay bam, jimmy b, herro, duncan, kyle lowry, spencer dinwiddie, bradley beal, pascal siakam, and kawhi leonard but ive been wrong before"

"The only counterpoint is dinwiddie is coming off an ACL injury. I do agree he is a better player than Dennis and acknlowegde that ACL injuries are not the death sentence they were years ago, but Dennis shoots the ball better than Spencer, percentage wise. I think Dennis is a better defender as well, but I’d personally take dinwiddie over Dennis. Dennis has some off the court stuff that’s been glossed over a lot, and just comes across as selfish to me."
"Gilbert Arenas.  Also, Spencer Dinwiddie just said he wants to play in DC lol"
The Nets didn't have to trade as many assets to get Harden as we did to get AD. Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie were already there while we had to give away any player equal or greater to that caliber to get AD.
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
I don't think Dinwiddie got that memo: [https://www.netsdaily.com/2021/7/30/22601490/could-spencer-dinwiddie-be-headed-to-wizards-after-russell-westbrook-blockbuster-trade](https://www.netsdaily.com/2021/7/30/22601490/could-spencer-dinwiddie-be-headed-to-wizards-after-russell-westbrook-blockbuster-trade)
Kuz and Trezz going to Brooklyn for Spencer Dinwiddie in sign and trade.
"We are getting Dinwiddie.  We aren’t taking Schroder or Buddy, we are using Trezz and Kuzma to get Spencer.  You guys have to figure out that Buddy and Schroder deal yourselves lol."
"Wasn't there a report that Washington wanted him to trade him to Brooklyn in a sign and trade for Spencer Dinwiddie, who is friends with Bradley Beal?"
We are getting Spencer Dinwiddie.  We don’t want Schroder.
"No I understand that, like in the Nets example Spencer dinwiddie is pretty much our only true homegrown player and he was also acquired by a trade.   The way that I read this post made it seem like the logic was placed in the fact that someone was drafted by their original team and won a chip a la a Dirk, but GMs will always ve making moves to improve the roster and someone being on a team for a while doesn’t necessarily mean they’re home grown (BroLo being on the team for a good amount of time but he was drafted and is loved by the Nets fans) that’s why I responded suit."

Wizards really gonna eat KCP’s deal to replace Westbrook with Spencer Dinwiddie

Spencer Dinwiddie sign and trade holy shit
"What’s the alternative? Spencer Dinwiddie? Not even trying to be funny, I just don’t know what plan B is"
I will be beyond disheartened with our FO if giving Spencer Dinwiddie a big contract is their grand idea to fix this team
"Point guard is #1.  Lowry makes a lot of sense, but he’s gonna be coveted by a lot of teams.    I wouldn’t even rule out a Dennis Schroeder return, but that seems very unlikely since there’s been reports of locker room tension with him.    I’m curious to see if Derrick Rose will re-sign in New York.  I also wanna know how much Spencer Dinwiddie will earn.  Similar for Goran Dragic.    Ish Smith and Bruce Brown are also good.  Bruce Brown is an RFA though.  Ish Smith could be a backup PG target."
It's gonna be pretty funny if they moved down in the draft and traded a 1st round pick just so they could overpay Spencer Dinwiddie.
I’m watch alot of basketball and Spencer Dinwiddie is lyle lowry.
"I see.  They must be talking about this quote of his  &gt;If you’re coming with three for 60, well everybody is coming for three for 60. Right. Now if you come with five for 125 … ‘like ooh’ … Steve Balmer and Joe Tsai are very, very literally rich owners.   https://netswire.usatoday.com/2021/07/09/spencer-dinwiddie-suggests-hed-stay-with-the-nets-for-125-million-over-five-years/"
"If he gives out birthday cryptocurrency, he may entice the services of one Spencer Dinwiddie."
2021 nets with Spencer Dinwiddie potentially coming off the bench
I think you mean Spencer Dinwiddie.
It depends how realistic and viable Lowry is as an option. That to me is the definite no 1  After that I think it's a tough call. Like are you better off if you can get Spencer Dinwiddie and keep the stuff you would have to give up to match salary with Russ? I probably think you are as one ex.
yes on the vet min and once cp3 goes there also on the vet min we can have cp3/lowry/bron/demar/AD with john collins and spencer dinwiddie coming off the bench also on the vet min
"This is not a great season for free agency.   &gt; Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, John Collins and Spencer Dinwiddie are among the most compelling names to monitor"
