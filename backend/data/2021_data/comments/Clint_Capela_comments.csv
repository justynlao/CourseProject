I just don't see the argument for that era of houston teams being contenders without Harden. They would have struggled to be a playoff team.  The last 4 or 5 seasons harden was averaging 30~ a game with 8 assists. Those houston teams had harden scoring 35 a game and then Eric Gordon or Clint Capela pitching in their 15. I just don't see the argument that houston without Harden was a perennial playoff team that had a bunch of guys stepping up. It's just not factual.
"We got Clint Capela for one first round pick and he's pretty much the same player as Ayton this season, realistically probably better if you dig into the stats.  I know Ayton has a higher ceiling of course, but finding a decent center is not that hard."

"Just to add this, the on off stats are poor when comparing two players from two different teams. It is very contextual. For example a player could be the heart and soul of a team but the team could also have a capable backup center and maybe a Barea type backup point so the second unit offense runs well. At the same time you could be a good but not great type like a Clint Capela but because your backup is like an Isaac Hartenstein type your on off numbers are stilted. Much like this, maybe the starting five works well and has great players and your center Jordan Bell is playing with those Curry and Thompson and looking good in the advanced stats but your David West type solid backup is all of a sudden surrounded by Damion Lee and Quincy Cook types"
Frank Vogel delighted at the sight of Bruno Fernando on the court instead of Clint Capela
"Lakers fans on IG be like ""we need to get CLINT CAPELA you think he'll get bought out?"""
"All those guys are clearly better defensively. I forgot to add Bam Adebayo, who is also clearly better. If you wanna add centres who are debatable with Drummond, you can add: Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Serge Ibaka and Nerlens Noel. Some ppl may say Jokic and KAT are also similar defensively compared to Drummond. I think you're overrating his defensive impact based on the counting stats."
"I think when he has played, Clint Capela has been a force on the defensive end.   I think with Capela, Collins, Hunter and Reddish the Hawks have a real solid defensive core"
Capela was soo good he was two people at once SMH RIP in peace never forget DPsOY Clint Capela and Clint Capela 2017 - 2018.
Us Nuggets fans were all too familiar with the buzzsaw that was Prime Harden.  Clint Capela was undefeated against the Denver Nuggets for like years
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokić - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vučević - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valančiūnas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics

Clint Capela has been amazing for us on defense. But he and JC together kind of clogs the paint on offense.
"I'd rather have a healthy Clint Capela. So far, Christian Wood has shown little impact on winning games. He reminds me of MPJ from last year. Sure, he scores a lot, but does he score when it matters most (in the clutch time) and does he provide other value beyond scoring on offense and defense?"
Teams already have plenty of tape on Jarrett Allen so he is already in that overpay territory for his next contract.   Allen has been the Nets starting Center for 3yrs. Before he was traded he was back to starting over DeAndre Jordan. It’s not like he’s this unknown product like Mo Bamba.    He’s a proven 11pts 10reb player at this stage of his career and could develop a jumper but the Nets didn’t prioritize the midrange. They were more interested in Lobs and Blocks. He had a midrange shot in college.   Allen has said over the summer he wants a Clint Capela 5yr/$90m at minimum and that’s when the Nets hit a snag in negotiations to re sign.
The Hawks are +15.4 points per 100 possessions (97th percentile) when John Collins and Clint Capela are both on the floor.
Clint Capela says hi.
You mean someone like Christian Wood or Clint Capela?
If Clint Capela becomes dennis Rodman he's gonna be in my top 10 for the league. That man grabbed boards and played D like a madman.
**Stars with a good shot**  AD/Giannis/Joker/Luka/Simmons/Sabonis  **Very good players with a shot**  Draymond Green/LaMelo Ball/Lonzo Ball/Clint Capela/Andre Drummond/Dejounte Murray/Myles Turner  **Maybe somehow if they get play time (even if it is extremely unlikely)**  Elfrid Payton/Rajon Rondo
"I was scrolling down YouTube and went past a game report on Clint Capela and I was like “wtf, did we trade Schröder to the hawks? He’s fucking huge now, what??” But then realise it was Capela"
"The Rockets won that trade though. I don’t want to shit talk Clint, because I like him a lot. He’s a good dude and a hard worker, but he is pretty much useless offensively. His responsibilities were to catch lobs and play defense and he had hands of stone about 41 games a season. In half a season, they flipped an injured Capela for Christian Wood. Harden is better with a lob threat/rim runner, but Clint isn’t helping anyone from the bench."
"he's asking if calling clint capela an ""absolute monster"" is a reference to the kanye west song monster which features the line ""triple double no assist"""
Lmao Clint Capela is just an evolved Dennis Schroeder
I’ll take the era with Clint capela
"Then it's off to hang with Trae Young and them bois  Clint Capela is on absolute fire, troubled waters ahead for the Nets"
No it was Westbrook. They wanted capela out of the paint so he could run free. At this point you can only have one non shooter on the floor at once imo. Either a big or a guard and the rockets had a guard issue. They should have tried to trade Clint for a actual shooting center
That's amazing! Shoutouts Clint Capela.
When Clint Capela and Trae Young play good: I'm happy
Not sure if Trae Young and Clint Capela or Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo
"Even though I’m not a fan of the team, I can always get behind some good defense. Also I’ve always liked Clint Capela from what I’ve watched"
Still doesn't feel right having an actual NBA quality center since the Dominican Chris Kaman days. Clint Capela is soooooooo fucking solid  Player of the week baby!!!
Clint Capela had a full 5 course meal god damn
#Clint Capela  #Trae Young
Dennis Schröder evolves into Patrick Williams who evolves into Clint Capela.
clint capela one block shy of a triple double no assists
&gt; I'm curious about how well guys like Marc Gasol and Clint Capela have been defensiely.   Can only speak for Marc but ive been super happy. So smart and great at defending inside. Obviously has his same certain weak matchups but that's when we go to AD at the 5
&gt; Clint capela  holy shit
"loved watching Rockets Legend Clint Capela play alongside Rockets Legend Kyle Lowry, Rockets Legend Carmelo Anthony, and Rockets Legend Goran Dragic"
"I have been a massive Clint capela fan since he was drafted, always thought he could make an all defensive team or even dpoy at his ceiling"
"Lavine and grant are better than Wiggins, simply more valuable. And you can make the case for TJ Warren and Clint capela as well imo, but that’s if they’re on the right team."
"I hope the Warriors development staff doesn't make Wiseman a ""Clint Capela lob threat"". Wiseman looks like he has the potential to be Giannis/AD like plus shooting touch."
Post Clint Capela highlights
A high-quality performance for Clint Capela that places him alongside some of the great legends of the NBA.
"[Per @EliasSports, Clint Capela is the first player since Shaquille O’Neal to record at least 25 pts/25 rebs/5 blks in a game (3/21/04 LAL vs. MIL). Capela is the ninth player in NBA history to do so.](https://twitter.com/HawksPR/status/1352109233643393024?s=19)"
Clint capela should be on your DPOY top 5
Dennis Schröder evolves into Patrick Williams who evolves into Clint Capela.
lol the whole nba gonna implode if Clint Capela makes an all star team
"I'm just wondering what Allen is going to cost to resign.  I'm expecting somewhere between 16-20 mil AAV.  Maybe a Clint Capela 5/90 type of deal but considering what the Cavs need from the Center position, whether it's with Love as the starting PF or someone else, that's still perfectly acceptable."
"How dare they not talk about Clint capela, that’s the storyline of the decade.   In all seriousness, I agree."
IM SO GLAD I HAVE CLINT CAPELA IN FANTASY
"Clint Capela, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond, Nikola Vucevic  How would you rank those players"
Clint Capela.  We fleeced Houston.
"Clint ""Wilt Chamberlain"" Capela"
Capela trade deadline tasty. Do the Hawks need Collins and CLint?
Clint Capela
Clint Capela with the CLUB 60!
"Hawks players put up some fucking numbers today.     - John Collins 31 points and 11 boards.   - Clint Capela 27 points, 26 boards and 5 blocks.   - Trae Young 38 points, 10 assists."
but why would a team trade a equal or better center for Clint Capela though. Part of them trading Capela in the first place was also because they were losing a lot of games with him in the lineup.
"It’s not even about this specific game, he’s perfectly capable in the 4th in general and people just lose their shit whenever he has the occasional bad one trying to be the first to say “I told you so”.  His post game is good. He’s not Jokic and he’s sure as hell not Shaq but he is absolutely a guy you can dump the ball to in the low post and expect a reasonable amount of success a lot of the time. It’s matchup-dependent, Gasol absolutely fucked him in 2019, but against even the majority of good teams that’s an option we have with him.  The other obvious option, which we barely used prior to this year for unknown reasons, is the pick and roll. You can go either way with Giannis, he’s a very capable ball handler as well as roll man. The Middleton/Giannis pick and roll is a great option, but we’ve run Giannis/Forbes and Giannis/Portis with him handling that have looked pretty good. We could likely do the same with Middleton and Lopez among the starters. He’s not just a glorified Clint Capela or some shit, he’s an extreme threat in those situations that needs to be accounted for (and if he is accounted for, it’s going to make Middleton’s life a hell of a lot easier because the attention is off him).  Shit, you’re a Heat fan. You’ve seen what Bam can do in the right system, in crunch time and in big games. There’s nothing he can do that Giannis can’t, and Middleton isn’t a superstar or anything but he’s absolutely capable of being a Butler-type scoring and playmaking threat. *When used right*, Giannis can still be dominant in any game scenario."
"He got outplayed by Clint Capela. This dude is supposed to be a top 15 player and he’s getting outplayed by a role player, on both ends. I’m not talking about the team. Through the first 3 games of the series he shot 33%, 22% and 39%. He took 31 shots through 3 games. He’s supposed to be your best player and that’s how he plays."
"You’re right, he only needed Jimmy Butler. And even then he played like shit against Clint Capela."
"FG% isn't really indicitive of 'shooting' for a bigman. Otherwise Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, and Clint Capela are really good shooters.   Shooting in this context to me means 3pt and midrange, but I was mostly referring to his 3pt"
I watch plenty of Enes Kanter lol. He made Clint Capela look like Wilt Chamberlain yesterday.
"Exactly. For example a wide open three with 20 seconds on the clock is good shot selection if you’re Curry, and horrible shot selection if you’re someone like Clint Capela. Same shot, but can be good or bad depending on the player."
"This sub doesn’t realize Collins stats are largely tied to how many pick n rolls his PG runs with him. He struggles to score outside of that, offensive put backs, and spot up 3s. Clint Capela clogs the paint so John is limited in his pick n roll opportunities.  You can combat this by playing John at the 5 offensively but he’s an absolute turnstile on the interior against bigger players.   Either John expands his offensive game in a way that gets him good looks, or he’s relegated to the role he’s currently in. Because Clint is a game changer on the glass and defensively overall. Collins is a slightly below neutral defensively at best. His value on the court fluctuates too much for someone who wants a max contract.   If the Hawks were to move Capela for a shooting center, that’d ease things up. But then the team defense suffers...it’s hard when Trae AND Collins need players around them to make up for their defensive deficiencies. No one ever talks about Collins defense but you’ll see a random Trae defense post every week here"
"While I'd love it for the nostalgia, that's probably never gonna happen.  Harden already knows what playing with WB and no big men is like.  If anything, I'm hoping they trade Kyrie for a decent center to help them in the postseason.    I bet (if they can get Kyrie to return and play well for a month to drive his stock up) that they have a chance at someone like Myles Turner or Vucevic (and maybe a first or some expirings to match contracts).    Who knows, maybe Utah (read: Mitchell) gets tired of Gobert's shit again and they're willing to trade him.  If that falls through even someone like Clint Capela would help.  As is, DJ isn't gonna help them against any of the elite centers, and definitely not against AD."
That clint capela guy seems like a good lob partner
This man really talking about trading Kyrie for Clint fucking Capela. Jesus Christ reddit
"They had iso with very specific personnel and a well built switch system, as well as a much more cohesive defensive identity (Chris Paul, Clint Capela, Tucker). Nets have a more Frankenstein-ish focus on iso, with less defense"
"What a pointless post. Hassan is a limited defensive anchor. Like Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert. He’s okay, playing okay minutes, on an okay team. If he didn’t deserve a spot then he would be out the NBA."
"&gt; Centers are notorious for peaking their rookie years because the position is so easy  14 pts, 8 reb, 1 ast - Anthony Davis' ""peak"" rookie season.   10 pts, 7 reb, 2 ast - Nikola Jokic's ""peak"" rookie season.   7 pts, 6 reb, 2 ast - Bam Adebayo  2 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Rudy Gobert  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 ast - Nikola Vucevic  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Serge Ibaka  4 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Deandre Jordan  3 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Clint Capela  2 pts, 1 reb - Thomas Bryant  3 pts, 4 reb, 1 blk - Steven Adams"
"(non-Hawks) people only care about Capela insofar as they can use Houston trading him as a reason to shit on Russ.  Otherwise nobody cares enough to watch him play. Literally not one person has ever turned on a game thinking ""fuck yeah, I get to watch Clint Capela today!"""
"Go to the suns sub and you will see the same thing. Sub is VERY split on Ayton. His apologists bring up his defense and rebounding but we didn’t draft this guy to be a Clint Capela type player. His offensive creation is bad, he doesn’t look to score vs smaller guys, still watches guys drive to the rim doesn’t even attempt to block it even tho he is the biggest guy out there and he also watches rebounds that he could potential out hustle someone for but he is too concerned about foul calls. We all want him to succeed as we need an inside presence and with his body he should be doing DAMAGE but he isn’t and it’s frustrating."
"Even looking at the box scores you can see that the scoring is there, only two games scored under 100 so the offensive can produce. But shit I think Beal’s comments about not being able to guard a parked car is putting it nicely.   A team should never give up near 150 in a game ever, if Atlanta is willing to trade Clint Capela then the wizards need to scrape whatever assets they can for him. Don’t know how much that’ll help but having a decent defensive anchor down low will improve some of the worse defensive my eyes have had the displeasure of seeing."

"There was an article about it on the Athletic yesterday, and if you don't have access to that Kevin O'Connor and Chris Vernon talked about it on their Friday podcast.   Evidently JC made some loud comments about how the team needed to get into its offense faster and the ball needed to move more in the middle of a film session. Clint Capela pulled Trae aside and told him that he'd seen that kind of tension tear a team apart"
"2015, he has pat Bev, Trevor Ariza and Capela  2018-19, he had Carmelo Anthony and Clint Capela  19-20 he had Russell Westbrook"
Major “we want the warriors” Clint Capela vibes
It was all Clint Capela type spoon fed buckets those 1st 2 years.   Then his 3rd year he started posting up more. He's not a good post up player.  Check his shooting stats. 81.5% of his shots came from 0-3 feet his 1st 2 years.   Then it went down when he started to post up and use hooks and floaters more his 3rd year. Shoots less than 40% from 3-10 feet lol. No touch...
"this is what made the Onyeka Okongwu interesting if things go according to plan he's going to be their long term starting 5 and they made that pick without even seeing Clint Capela play a game. Capela has looked better this year than last year in Houston, but I do think that's the one that will likely end up being dealt at some point.   Although at the same time while Ive thought they would get an extension done with JC, it's still quite possible he ends up walking and they dont match an offer sheet from someone next summer. I dont think theyll go into the luxury either, I dont think Bogdan will get dumped. It's either Capela or Gallinari, my guess being Capela is more likely."

"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
Basically a slightly better Clint Capela. He was overrated by virtue of playing on a good team and being eligible for awards at a weak position.
"Prime Deandre Jordan wouldn’t even be top 5 Centers in current league today  He would be less impactful than Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Bam, Sabonis, Gobert  I’d throw Nurkic in there too but Nurk been playing really bad.  Prime Deandre Jordan was more or less the bigger stronger Clint Capela  By far Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond are the worst All NBA selections in recent memory.. simply due to the fact that league was lacking hard at talented centers during those years"
"Trae Young John Collins Cameron Reddish DeAndre Hunter Onyeka Okungwu Bogdan Bogdanovic Kevin Huerter or Clint Capela  The expansion team would likely be a lap to choose a solid bet from either Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, or Rajon Rondo"
"He is? How come he got absolutely obliterated by Harden, CP3 and Eric Gordon in back-to-back postseasons? Clint Capela feasted because Houston just took Gobert onto the perimeter and abused him there time and time again."
People used to say this about Clint capela.
"Clint Capela, I presume"
"It’s subtraction by addition imo. DJ is already a good fit offensively, and Jeff Green is perfect. If you could stick a controller up his ass and make him be all star Clint Capela then yeah he’d be great, but I don’t think a rookie head coach who has already shown to have a guard heavy system is gonna be able to make him play like that. Even if it is a first ballot HOFer."
"But it didn’t happen overnight lmao the guy gets better every game of his career. No it’s not sustainable, but it’s also not unreasonable to think his peak shooting splits will be just a shade below what he’s at now. You’re acting like it’s Clint Capela doing this out of nowhere"
Trae young and Clint capela will save the all star game
There's not a whole lot of good trades to choose from but I'd say the Clint Capela trade last year has and will pay off big time for the Hawks.  He's a straight up baller.
He needs to play next to a rim protecting 5 like Clint capela and in line ups with shot creators and ball handlers who can set him up and allow him to use his off ball movement and timing to get good looks   Collins is a system player. He can be a really valuable one. But that’s what you’re getting. I’d only offer a max if you’re damn certain he’s the piece that puts you over the top.   I’ve soured on the idea as the year has gone on.
Man I really wish the hawks could put it all together. Cam Reddish/Clint Capela/Trae Young/DeAndre Hunter/John Collins would be a really good frontcourt. Hopefully we can see it in the 2nd half
Clint Capela is Jokic Daddy but other than that I agree

Is Clint Capela the spoopiest person?
To be fair Clint Capela murders everyone on the boards. He’s a monster
"Mixture of pretty good defense, clint capela, and some poor shooting."
"Clint Capela does 4 things - Rim Defense, Rebound, Dunk, and steal your dreams"
That was some of the ugliest shooting I’ve seen this team put up.  Also I don’t ever want to face Clint Capela again.
I love Clint Capela so much what a valuable selfless player. like a nice marcus smart
"He should thank, dwight howard, chris paul , russell westbrook, trevor ariza, eric gordon , clint capela , pj tucker  and the refs/ adam silver when the rockets retire his jersey"
LeBron currently has a worse PER than Jarrett Allen and Clint Capela. That tells you all you need to know about this stat.
"Dude Robert fucking Williams is only playing 15 minutes a game when he is literally Clint capela 2.0. What he’s doing in those limited minutes is insane, blocking shots, offensive rebounds, catching lobs, cleaning up misses. We’re not stopping embiid with him or anything, but it’s a disgrace he’s not getting more minutes. Trade theis for a competent wing Danny dumbass and maybe he’ll actually develop"
"If this is what they are in the playoffs, I would be fucking scared of them.  Maybe some West team should risk it and get Clint Capela and see if he's still the Gobert kryptonite.... doubt it though"
"That's so true, he's not a 1v1 defender but an entire paint defender. Also just because you mentioned Capela I'll also take the chance to mention that Clint shot 3/14 from the field for just 6 points in his game against Rudy this season."
"That doesn't even matter lol, a center's defensive impact goes far beyond 1v1 matchups. Clint Capela could score 20 points and Gobert's defensive impact would still be felt by both cratering opponents' FG% at the rim and deterring shot attempts at the rim altogether (turning them into inefficient floaters and mid-range shots)."
&gt; Clint Capela  huh?
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
"If we go by that stat, Jakob Poeltl, Clint Capela, Joe Harris all deserves an all star selection. It's a bit of an overrated stat imo"

"The Len, Bruno, Jones center rotation were dark days, but thank god for Clint Capela"
The hawks are a poorly coached team with massive injuries.   I watch every hawks game and I can confidently say he is our 2nd best player and has been a godsend defensively. I get that the hawks are losing but they have blown multiple games in the 4th quarter as the coaching staff was rolling with lineups that didn’t even include capela for whatever season. Hell we were in a 4 point game vs the pacers a few days back. with 4 min to go and we took out Clint who was out leading scorer that game and we got blown out after that.
Clint Capela is his Marc Gasol
MVP “favorite” Nikola Jokic woke up feelin dangerous tonight 🥶  15 points 💪🏽  5-15 from the field 😳  2/5 from deep 🔥  5 personal fouls ‼️  Another loss to Clint Capela 😤
"Clint ""Despite the loss"" Capela  But in all seriousness, I think he's been really good for the Hawks. He's not the problem. Losing Hunter hurts, but also, it shows that the Hawks aren't deep enough at the forward position.  Cam hasn't developed (yet?) like they hoped, Gallo doesn't play defense. Hawks are still young. We just have higher expectations for them because they started the season hot."
"Clint had Jokic in hell and had 20/10. That's Clint Capela, that's quality."

"Jeremy Lin doesn't deserve his ring  Dirk does deserve his ring  Clearly there's a sliding scale here, and Lebron going 4-2 with Delly against a 67 win exact same team means he didn't need Kyrie or Love.  Give him like Clint Capela and Jamal Murray and it's a win"

"One of the best coaches and GM in the league, MVP Harden, Point God CP3, 6th man of the year Eric Gordon, Clint Capela, Austin Rivers, PJ Tucker and solid role-players. How is that team not stacked? They could have won the championship if it wasn’t for the Warriors superteam with 2 MVPs."

"Top 5 person named Clint Capela, but that accountant in San Diego is having a strong year"

Clint Capela who averaged 7.2MPG and Beverley who watched from the sidelines in a suit?
That's a weird way to say  Pat Bev Trevor Ariza Clint Capela
"Because people don’t realize how crazy good Adams is, his numbers don’t reflect how good he is at all. Pretty sure his team’s offensive rebounding percentage is crazy higher with him on the court than off the court for his career. And people don’t understand how smart he is, Adams makes all the stuff he does look easy but only a couple guys in the league can do what he does.  That’s why he’s still a good player playing his style and got $40/2 year extension last offseason. Him, Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Clint Capela, and Rudy Gobert are the only starting centers in the league who still play that way, and Jordan probably shouldn’t even be a starter anymore (maybe Jarrett Allen should take his spot in this list though). It’s REALLY hard to play center in the league without a three point shot now."
"What the hell, why are Clint Capela and Joe Harris above Jerami Grant"
"Lol, Clint capela should be on this list"
The Clint Capela disrespect yo
as a pistons fan ive been saying this since like 2016.   anything other than a lob or dunk from Andre drummond is a wasted possession. period.  he has the worst touch around the rim that i've ever seen from ANY PLAYER ever.  he plays like if Clint capela thought he was jokic.
"This is my time to shine. In six to eight years of watching most of his games, here's a rudimentary outlook.  **Pros**  * Clears the defensive glass (though often in an empty, contested paint). Clears boards regardless.   * Can finish with dunk on pick &amp; roll when lob is delivered above the rim.  * Sticks with his own misses, often tipping own shot three to four times in one single possession.   **Cons**  * Arguably the worst post game in modern history among all-star centers who still feel obligated to get touches (Ben Wallace couldn't post-up either but at least knew what he was and wasn't).   * One of his go-to moves in half-court offense is a running 13-foot floater.   * Shoots 59 percent from the free throw line, which is somehow a 20 percent improvement over what he used to shoot. Has been hovering in 59 percent range for four seasons.   * Has attempted 92 3-pointers over the past four seasons. That's 92 attempts too many for someone shooting 10.9 percent from three.   * Offensive rebounds often inflated on account of re-tipping his own point blank misses inside that should have been finished in the first place.  * Shooting just 47.4 percent from the field despite being built in the mold of a Clint Capela or DeAndre Jordan. In contrast, teammate Jarrett Allen is currently shooting 64.6 percent.   * Has a .500 total shooting percentage... for a guy who generally should never be shooting outside of three feet. Again, for comparison, teammate Jarrett Allen currently has a 69.5 percent total shooting percentage.  * Sometimes tries defensively, sometimes not.   * Subject to ill-timed fouls.  * Will openly mope when things aren't going his way, at times manifesting itself in lingering in the backcourt while an opposing team breaks out in the open floor for a back-breaking 3-pointers during an 5-on-4 advantage in transition leading to a time-out."
"He is IMMENSELY talented but seems completely averse to playing to his strengths. He's probably an all-star level player if he locked down and focused on his defense, and approached the offensive end like Rudy Gobert and Clint Capela do. But he doesn't.  Instead he thinks he's a post up big and occasionally a point center, which results in an endless stream of turnovers and a lot of inefficient shooting.  Defensively, he has the tools, but mixes in games with no effort where he's a complete liability. It's just a catastrophe.  He's basically a mirror image of Dwight Howard in Charlotte, if anybody watched that."
"I mean...[look at this] (https://imgur.com/a/D6aLclu)  I got it from [this site] (https://www.thehoopsgeek.com/average-nba-height/)  It's really not even close. Yes, I know there are exponentially more players in the NBA right now, but in that 1962 season when Wilt averaged 50 PPG, 25 RPG and somehow 48.5 minutes per game, there were only 2 other players over 6'10"" and they were Bill Russel and Walt Bellamy - all 3 of them HOF.   Imagine if we put every player over 6'10"" into the HOF in 2020...Davis Bertans for the Hall? Clint Capela? Wilt was a ridiculous, legendary basketball player but if you take him in his prime and put him in 2021, he's not averaging 50/25, or his career numbers of 30/23."
"Teams like the Nuggets and Mavs with playoff hopes but shitty defense would be willing to give some picks and young players for Smart. I could easily see a MPJ for Marcus Smart swap.  If we wanted to get crazy, I think Smart + tons of picks could land the Celtics Christian Wood (ik Rockets fans will crucify me, but you’d rather have 4 first rounders, trust me). I also think that picks + exception could get them a guy even as good as Kyle Lowry (not this exact player but a guy of that caliber and circumstance).  They could also benefit from a Steven Adams/Clint Capela, but I don’t know how realistic those options are.  Honestly, as long as the Celtics have two All-NBA level wings they will be competitive, but I doubt they could beat a defensive team like the Bucks or Sixers."
Clint Capela looked like an all star vs Gobert. Rim protection is overrated in the playoffs

Clint Capela is overrated tbh
Donovan Mitchell over Clint Capela 2.0.
"Clint Capela for sure. His defensive effort and presence has turned the Hawks from basically worst defensive team in the league to an above average one. Trae and John get all the attention, but Clint has been our most game changing player this season."
"I mean I hear you, but 538 has Clint Capela ranked as the top defender in the league"
What does Clint Capela have to do with Draymond Green?
Was it a regular season or playoff game?  Cause I remember a certain former Rockets player (cough cough Clint Capela) destroying Gobert in the playoffs...
"Actually it was Clint Capela lmao, man out goberts Gobert. CP3 was amazing that game 5 though"
"That was objectively a foul, unlike the 5th that the NBA called on Clint capela. Refs clearly sold the hawks Dude. Be objective"
Foul on Clint Capela for too many rebounds against Dallas
"You can narrativize Harden's season too. CP3 missed a lot of time that year, his second leading scorer was Clint Capela. Beyond that, the Rockets had a bunch of role players whose value could only be realized through Harden generating open 3s. That's a pretty far cry from Middleton, Brogdon and regular season Bledsoe (who looked like a fringe all-star that season). Despite that, he lead them to 4 games behind the first seed in the West, while having the best scoring season since Michael Jordan."
"yeah, not shocked.  baynes was not doing well against clint capela either.  JV feasted on him all night."
Jesus on FSSW I thought the graphic showed the kicks trading d rose for Clint Capela
Jamal Murray Caris LeVert Jimmy Butler Robert Covington Clint Capela
"People ITT are making fun of his free throw %, but before he got hurt, he made them at a rate similar to a bunch of current centers. Overall, he'd find a place, maybe as a starter--he was as good as Clint Capela."
"It's still the TWolves (to be fair to them but especially supportive: the ones without KAT of course) + there's a history of bigs dominating (especially the recent Clint Capela's one before this), but still, Capela had a triple double with blocks and Jarrett Allen played like Wilt Chamberlain, so nothing at all that moots these performances I would say."
Yeah. I mean this is fair. Harden made Clint Capela look like Wilt against Gobert a few years ago in the playoffs.
Yet he was vastly outplayed by Clint Capela.
"Gobert, KAT, Vuc &gt; Bam.  Shout out Clint Capela &amp; Deandre Ayton too."
"maybe if you throw in a few scrubs like trae young, clint capela, and oneka okongwu, and turn the picks into pick swaps we could consider parting with deanthony melton and maybe also killian tillie or jontay porter"
Lmao. We traded the ghost of even Turner and like a second and ended up with clint capela on an extended contact. Feels like 2k when you turn on trade override.
"Clint Capela, John Collins, DeAndre Hunter, Danilo Gallinari and then there is Reddish and Dunn but they don't really hamper us. 3 starters (including a DPOY candidate and the league's leading rebounder and a guy like Gallinari who has been on fire is detrimental.  I'll take the downvotes, because I know its Grizzlies fans but the logic is mental. We have injuries and we are sitting players because we are 4th and it was a great time to do so. We were on a winning streak and got ourselves into position to where if we lose we are 4th if we win we were 4th. It was a back to back and people are sucking wind. We are like 13 and 5 since the all star break but the thread seems to think they played the normal Hawks roster and that was close to how we usually look.  But to stop ranting and just answer the question Capela and Collins are more significant than JJJ. Hunter has been out for a while but he is the best defensive player. Gallinari has been doing great and spaces the floor for us. We had a rookie playing center and a rookie backing that position up. A game ago we had 3 of those players."
"The majority of ours. You guys have a few injuries too which is unfortunate but cmon no Clint , JC, Hunter , Capela or Cam, that’s 4 of our best 5 out . This line up we have our so t beating anybody"
This goes to show how valuable Clint Capela is. Mans singlehandedly carries the defense
Anyone who says Clint capela shouldn’t make an all NBA defensive team should watch this hawks team without him. Clint has kept us from being historically bad on defense
Clint Capela
"It’s not that hard to pick out the MVP. Raw ppg does it like half the time. Here are some players that are top 20 in the league in PER-  Clint Capela Nikola Vucevic Montrezl Harrel  Jonas Valanciunas  It’s an awful stat that can’t measure defense and way overvalues rebounding. Even the guy who made the stat doesn’t think it’s relevant anymore. Stuff like RAPTOR, RPM, and LEBRON are able to use on/off and tracking data to give a clearer picture. There’s really no point in using PER, Win Shares or BPM anymore."
Clint Capela
"You keep using the word scorer, and your examples had Clint Capela who at that point only scored off of lobs, Ryan Anderson who primarily scored off of standing outside the 3 and getting wide open looks. Their face value statistics looked good because MDA ran a high pace offense that inflated everyone’s numbers.   No one needs your terrible basketball IQ, you don’t have basic knowledge of what made that team work and how it happened. Somehow you think that Houston team was a offensive capable team individually. Harden made them that good, what has Ryan Anderson done since Houston? What has Trevor Ariza done since Houston??   They were only good because Harden made them. Oh and btw thank you for acknowledging that Harden was the engine of a team made up of at best 3  high level role players that still somehow won 55 games."
"Check 1998-2003 winners. 3x DRob, Shaq in 2002, TMAC 2003?   Here’s the top 10 list for years: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws_per_48_top_10.html  To name a few ridiculous ones:  Zubac in 4th 2020  Mitchell Robinson 5th 2020  Clint Capela 4th 2018  Tyson chandler 4th 2013  Tiago spitter 8th 2013  This is a terrible metric for actual value."
"I thought you just said they are all so offensively capable. I’m sure they could find a system for the 9-10 minutes Harden would sit???   Known offensive superstars Ryan Anderson, Clint Capela, and Trevor Ariza."
He’s got work to do for sure but he can get to Clint Capela level with better passing
Could a rebound and blocking machine such as Walter Tavares (Real Madrid) or Clint Capela (Hawks) help to strengthen the bench and drag difficult games over the line.

u think 100 bucks is anything to the god clint capela?
"He was learning that this yr!  He was sooooo much better on D this season, not falling for fakes, not fouling nearly as much, you could see the growth.  He just can't stay healthy :/  It sucks for us, because we are so much better on both ends when Mitch is on the court.  He was absolutely on his way to being a Clint Capela for us, but like you said, he needs to gain more muscle mass/strength so that his frame can withstand a full season."
I would like to thank Clint Capela for putting his life on the line so I could post this.
CLINT CAPELA!
"Clint capela should get a lot more notoriety than what he is getting right now, but I’m not shocked. The National media doesn’t watch hawks games."
"Well that leaves just the eye test.  We’re clueless there.  I still like looking at the offensive side of these stats however.  there’s really thenno way to argue about defense on this sub besides random unsubstantiated opinions being thrown out.  Like I could just say Clint capela is a better defender than gobert, how can I get proven wrong."
"He is above average, but the question is he better than Clint Capela, Baynes,Enes Kanter i would say no."
"Look at Wiseman's draft class, everyone of note is outperforming him. As far as big men, you would anticipate that he'd at least be a serviceable centre after All Star break but he's a massive net negative every minute he's on the floor.  I'm concerned whether he'll even be a rotational calibre centre next season. The potential is obviously there, but his understanding of the game is so bad he should be strictly limited to a Clint Capela role for the foreseeable future, which is not what I'd imagine his camp would be happy with for a 2nd overall pick."
Even coming out of the draft his potential was questioned. His projected skillet was basically that of taller Clint Capela.
"For the Hawks it's definitely Clint Capela. He's definitely a beast, don't get me wrong, but he's not the all star many Hawks fans think he should be. He's got a long way to go offensively, his finishing is so poor it can be hard to watch. Love him though!"
"Obviously it’s gobert, but why is Clint Capela not even being talked about here. It would be a crime If he doesn’t make all defensive 2nd team.   Clint has been the only consist defensive presence in Atlanta, and has been a huge floor raiser for trae young and John Collins on D"

Clint with better offensive game from passing mostly. but I think hes also a bit more mobile than Capela.
Clint Capela with better offense but worse rebounding and slightly worse interior defense.
Clint Capela
Clint Capela with the ability to pass is a much better comp  Bam legit defends 1-5 at a high level and shoots 80%+ from the FT line and has a good midrange jumper
when do we start talking about clint capela? the man is averaging 15/15.
Clint Capela is easily as physical as Embiid big boss. Watch some of his highlight reels for this year. He fr been manhandling grown men all year to like 15/15.
"People are criticizing the pick because he is a lot more raw than promised. Most thought he could come in and be Clint Capela right away then develop into A star post Steph. Guys like Ingram who came in raw had 3 years to develop with zero pressure to win.   In order for him to develop he will have to go the Siakam route since Raptors were winning and do a lot of that in the Gleague. He turns the warriors from a low tier playoff team into the worst team in the league based on on off rating when he plays.  Lamelo, Halliburton, PWill all help the them more in the immediate future and have more trade value and were selected after Wiseman. Not to mention Draymond best position is center so I don’t see how Wiseman closes any playoff game. Just a dumb pick at the time and even more in hindsight."
Because trading away those guys and attacking free agency is your only hope.   Wiseman will never be a positive player on the floor while Curry is still in his prime. He’s too far away if he even reaches anything resembling a Clint Capela which I personally believe to be his ceiling.
"I think the best comp is the a bill gates version of Clint capela, with Kevin Garnett type overall defense if he played in today’s game."
"There's definitely a case to be made for any of them.   As for Wiseman, my reasoning is that most athletic rim running bigs with Wiseman's frame and athletic ability typically pan out. I feel pretty comfortable that given the time to develop, he can be a Clint Capela/Christian Wood/Tyson Chandler type, and he already has the beginnings of a decent jumpshot. Those guys typically need years though. At one point Tyson Chandler was considered a quasi-bust, and Christian Wood was out of the league entirely, people weren't patient enough with them."

Why is this game being played?  Literally everyone that anyone cares about is out except on occasion Clint Capela.
He never took as many floaters last year once they traded Clint Capela. If you look at his floater sometimes it’s hard to tell if it’s a floater or lob when it leaves his hands but last year Rockets had no lob threat once Capela was gone so there were less floater opportunities.

Clint capela played the spurs all by himself? What team is he even on rn?
Rocket’s legend Clint Capela 🚀🚀 will always cheer for Clint
"Clint Capela a career [52.8% FT shooter](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/capelca01.html), who is shooting 55% this season, went 10/10 from the line. That’s impressive"
"Ah yes, the offensive showdown we all expected between.....Clint Capela and Jakob Poeltl?"
"Backup PG =&gt; Brunson  Consistency =&gt; Too vague so I don't know what you mean by that  Rebounding =&gt; Who should we trade for? Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capela , Enes Kanter , Dwight Howard, Tristan Thompson?  I suppose we should offer their current team all our first round picks and give them a max contract post trade.  I think you are searching too hard for holes. Mavs don't need to be perfect to become champions. A little better team than right now and with some winners luck, they can get it done."
Chris Paul and Clint Capela were no Bruce Brown and Nick Claxton for sure.

"18 first rounders is a ton, and I think you have to take into account just how random drafting can be. One thing I did that I found quite interesting is just pick any 7 year stretch and use a random number generator to randomly pick a list of 18 first rounders. Almost every time, you end up with a great, multiple time all-star, player.   I did it once from the 2005-2011 draft and got a team with DeMarre Carroll, Joakim Noah, Jrue Holiday and Steph Curryand then did it again with 2012-2018 draft and got Jaylen Brown, Micheal Porter Jr, Jonathan Isaac, Jamal Murray, Clint Capela, and Dennis Schroder.   18 first rounders doesn’t mean that you automatically win a championship, but it definitely means you get a top 10-15 player. You have to get really unlucky to not stumble into at least one elite player."
"I think that you’re just overrating Adams as a rebounder. He hasn’t played with Russ in two years now, and he’s not out there like Dennis Rodman on the defensive glass, as a matter of fact, he’s actually rebounding worse than he did in his last few years playing with Russ. Clint Capela was rebounding just fine with Houston until he got traded, so why ignore that?"
"Not disrespecting Harden whatsoever, but if you compare the 2 teams... there’s a huge difference in having as your 2nd best player Chris Paul instead of Kevin Love (who was terrible that season). I’d prefer having guys like PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon and Clint Capela over JR Smith, George Hill and Tristan Thompson any day of the week"
"Harden had a better team, which is the main reason for the better record. Russ would've killed for backups life Eric Gordon and Lou Williams, not only that Harden had great pieces like Patrick Beverley and Clint Capela to fill out the squad.  People act like the Rockets won 55 games because Harden was that much better than Russ, when in reality the difference wins was due to better coaching and a better roster"
"Gafford will thrive next to Russ. He needs a guard who can feed him on rolls and russ still demands doubles on drives. Nobody on the bulls did that except Zach who isn't a good PnR player (at least from the eye test). Expect him to keep getting better, don't know what to expect from hutch though.  Gafford has like a middle class man's clint capela ceiling"
Important for sure but he's closer to clint capela than jokic on offense.
Clint “Better him than Me” Capela
"Well obviously. I'm just saying being realistic there is zero chance. He's not even as good as players like Nurkic, Steven Adams, or Clint Capela. There's just no way in hell he gets the max"

"The only thing that really slows him down is foul trouble, now that he’s neutralized Clint capela. He’s been way better with that this year though"
That’s not really a fair comparison. We’re not talking about Clint Capela being spoon fed lobs on medium volume. Zion creates his own shot a lot of the time. Plenty of players don’t shoot jumpers. None of those players are as efficient as Zion on similar volume.
"Vintage DeAndre Jordan, current Rudy Gobert, sometimes Clint Capela. Guys who create space in the pick and roll by rolling hard to the rim. No postups, just screens, dunks, and rebounds on offense."
"Idc about “narratives”. That shit is just so spice things up for the fans and keep it interesting. Even when KD went down, the Warriors were still huge favorites in the betting markets. Nobody worth their salt thought the Warriors were in trouble. If Harden hadnt averaged 35, it would have been a clean sweep.   Im not downplaying any Houston team. Yes CP3 and Clint Capela were beasts that year. But even with a 3-2 HOU lead, the Warriors were still big betting favorites to win the series. GSW was absolutely disgusting team four 4-5 years, either the best or 2nd best all time. For the Rockets to push them to 7 was impressive. I dont hold it against Harden losing to that team."
"Lol it's not even close to the Nets' level. It'd be more accurate if say, Lakers traded Caruso, Kuzma &amp; Danny green for Damian Lillard. And then picked up Paul Millsap, John Collins, and somehow acquired Seth Curry. And Clint Capela"
Clint Capela
"Capela just didn’t fit with what the Rockets were doing anymore in general  They barely ran PnR’s from 2018-2020 and it was all Harden ISO’s. All of that meant Clint just chilled in the dunker spot   Morey was looking to trade for stretch big, or a big like Capela on a cheaper contract but couldnt before the deadline"
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.

"&gt; a player with a similar enough skillset outside of 3-point shooting,  Problem is that on a team that also has Clint Capela, that shooting is critically important.  Unless they're also moving Capela, I just don't see a spot for Ayton to flourish on that team.    Also, does it really help Phoenix all that much?  Collins scores more, but only by about 3 points per game this year, and he gets significantly fewer rebounds (3.5 fewer per game this year). And Ayton, albeit on only 10 shots a game, is shooting 60% from the field."
Hack a Clint Capela
Clint Capela
"&gt;I got downvoted into oblivion for saying that having better teammates elevates one’s own stats.  What a silly comment.  Harden averaged 11 assists with a lineup of Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza, Clint Capela, Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon off the bench."
That’s literally what happened though. We negotiated and it was reported that he wants Clint Capela money. Every team knew what contract he wants
Clint Capela deserves some Recognition
Clint Capela deserves it in my opinion
"Yes and as we all know effeciency is all that matter, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a product of playing in an offense with better players. It’s why Clint Capela is the best player of all time.  Besides what you are saying isn’t even true Iverson for instance was more effective in his 33p season in 2005 than in his MVP season."
"As a USC fan, I'm not particularly thrilled with Mobley's NBA prospects, especially as a top 3 pick. He's a great defender but offensively he floats in and out of games too much, and has very few counter moves. I see him closer to a Clint Capela type of player than a Giannis type. He'll be a good role player but I don't see him as some kind of franchise altering guy. I'd rather have Wiseman tbh. If we get the pick this year I want Kuminga or Jalen Suggs"

"When basic stats don't support your point, call them empty box score stats.  The man is third in the freaking league in assists.

"I honestly would say Rudy gobert. I know that people think of him as a star because of his name recognition but in reality he’s a super role player. He doesn’t create any offense of his own. He only scores 14 pts a game. His role is defense, screens, rebounding, and lobs. In role he’s no different than a Clint capela. He’s just way better at the defense part (and I mean way way way better)."

"Steve Clifford, there is a way to beat the Hawks. Please watch the Wizards game. You need to stop Bogdan Bogdonovic by having the guard stop him from shooting 3s in your mouth and the big man drops to prevent Clint Capela from rebounding. If Bogi stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win."
"Maybe they need a Zion injury again :)  But they might need to get a bit lucky. Guys like Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Myles Turner, Jusuf Nurkić, Clint Capela have all been picked in that range in recent years. We'll see."
Clint Capela
"None of those other players are considered centers.    What I'm getting at is that *he does not play like a traditional center.* If they played him with someone who played more like a traditional center it wouldn't be the same type of fit as having two traditional centers on the floor at the same time. He does not fill the role that one usually associates with a center, and his playstyle is not incompatible with the typical qualifications of a forward/guard.   There are plenty of obviously center-less lineups in the NBA like last seasons' Rockets as the most obvious example. ""Positionless basketball"" is the buzzword for the game today.    I'm not arguing that Jokic did not play as a center, I'm asking what qualifies as being a center, and what qualifies as being a forward? **For basketball in general.** Not specific to Jokic.   Then, why is Jokic only capable of qualifying as a center and not a forward? Someone could say that a point guard is someone that spends most of the time standing around the perimeter and is responsible for offensive playmaking. Clint Capela stands around the rim, rebounds, and does not playmake at all, so he is not a guard. What's the qualification for center/forward?   Again, if it comes down to ""there is always a center in every lineup, and the center is the tallest guy, and Jokic is always the tallest guy in his lineups"" then fine, that's an answer."
"So the only thing that qualifies being a center is being the biggest guy in the lineup?   The point I'm getting at is that Jokic plays the role in the Nuggets' offense that is almost always associated with the point guard. People have *general ideas* of what role each position should fill and the playstyle that Jokic has goes beyond a Rudy Gobert or Clint Capela, which is what is usually associated with the center position.   I can understand why people would object to Clint Capela being classified as a guard because they can point to specific aspects of his playstyle and state exactly how it does not align with the characteristics that they use to classify a guard. What are the specific, objective differences between the way Jokic plays and another position?    If, for example, the answer is as simple as just being the largest player in the lineup then that's fine, because at least it's *some* type of objective measurement. But saying ""he's only a center because he only plays center"" is circular logic."
"Ricky Rubio  Eric Gordon  Khris Middleton  Draymond Green  Clint Capela  with d rose/hart/ariza/pj/zubac off the bench would be a 60+win team imo. spacing,scoring,defense,depth,rebounding, etc. winning 60 games is a lot harder than it seems but this squad could do it"
"&gt; Clint has had a better year defensively than Bam.  Rim protection doesn't equal better defense, you know that, right? While you are right about Capela being a better rim protector, he is pretty much limited to paint and close-to-mid range shots, while you can use Bam to guard 3-point shooters as well, which is something he does very efficiently."
trae young to both john collins and clint capela
"I mean and [rim defense and several other things as well](https://craftednba.com/players/clint-capela).  [Bam is absolutely more versatile](https://craftednba.com/players/bam-adebayo) defensively and that is where he providers a ton of value. However Clint is straight up better at rim protection and contesting shots at the rim and blocks. Clint has had a better year defensively than Bam.  Obviously offensively Bam is the better player with his ability to facilitate and score from mid range as Clint is very limited there.  Clint makes up for some of that by being extremely elite on the glass and getting a lot of extra possessions for the Hawks.  Obviously over the long run teams would take Bam because of his versatility, but It isn't that weird to say Clint has had a better year this year."
"Chris Paul, James Harden, and Clinton Capela is a really solid big 3. I know Clint will probably get some hate to put him in a big 3... but if lebrons second run with the Cavs is considered a super team with kyrie and Kevin love, then so should that rockets squad."

Clint Capela about to do it this year
"A young Clint Capela, lol"
"Jokic makes others better and generates a lot of easy baskets, he’s too much of a wildcard player. Plus I’ve seen Gobert get outplayed by Clint Capela in a playoff series.  Give me the Jazz."
"Clint Capela. His stats are good and he looks good but I watched him get absolutely sonned by Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney in the playoffs so for that reason, I’m out * Mr Wonderful Voice *"
"Yet nikola vucevic gets the all star nod for inflated stats, hawks players were blackballed from the all star game (coaches vote) because Lloyd Pierce hated his own players.  Edit: I don’t want to slander vuch, but capela deserved that spot way more than he did. I am more mad about Clint not making the game than trae."
"I agree with all the first parts of your post.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't disrespect Bogut. He was a very good passer for a big and a good defender. We got away with having Zaza and Javale because we had that line up of death with Steph, Klay, Iggy, KD and Draymond. Also it's not like we met any teams with a dominant big. Except AD in Pelicans, but well. It was not like he really had any help.   There was no Giannis, Embiid or Jokic we had to beat. Hell, I just looked the line ups of our opponents after Bogut left. The best center we met in the playoff was probably Clint Capela. Not really a guy you can ask to go get 30 a night. LaMarcus Aldridge is probably the best big we had to face. But he plays right into how Draymond defends.   My point is that the other teams really didn't have a punish for that line up."
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."

He is. And he's one of the best role players in the league. Specially give how week the back up center all star has been in East (vuc this year) I can see capela having a monster DPoY level season and getting nominated. If the all star selections were later I'd take Clint over vuc for all star
Clint capela will be an all star first (hot take)
"Raptor rates Mike Conley and Rudy Gobert as top 5 players in impact, and Clint Capela as better than LeBron and KD. Obviously, if all advanced metrics point to a player being really good then he probably is (Gobert) I just think they don't mean much beyond that"
At the end of the day if rebounding is your only feature that stands out you're probably not that great of a center.  Clint Capela is what Andre Drummond should be.
"Yes, some of the more notable scrubs James Harden played with include Chris Paul, Clint Capela, and Russell Westbrook.   Those were supposed to be his “sidekicks” - truly pathetic. And you had losers like Trevor Ariza, defensive turnstiles Patrick Beverley &amp; PJ Tucker, and chuckers like Eric Gordon.  It’s a miracle Harden was able to win a playoff series, a testament to his greatness."
"Clint capela carried harden, thats why when capela got traded harden was afraid and left rockets, leaving you crying lmaoooo"
1. Trae Young 2. Clint Capela 3. DeAndre Hunter
Bigs never got that knock because no one has ever obsessed over a player's rebounding numbers the way NBA fans do about Westbrook's. If we had to hear about Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert's rebounds every single time they have a good game you'd probably hear a lot more of it lol
"This is off the top of my head because it's been a couple years  Harden contributed to 45% of Houston's points via field goals or assists  Rockets that season were a top three offense, pretty sure top two just behind Warriors elite all time high O Rating  Harden's most used teammates for that elite all time offense? PJ Tucker, Clint Capela, and then about 60 games of Chris Paul  I'm not sure if it was really better than Steph this season because Curry is significantly underrated all time by most, but it's obvious you are just throwing crap vs a wall here"
"Chris Paul played 58 games that season, Clint Capela played 67, Gordon played 68.  I think the amount of injuries they had were exaggerated honestly.  That roster was way better than this Warriors roster even if those guys missed time."
"I’m with you. While Gobert may have been a slightly better defender than Capela this year, Clint has been better on offense."
"As previously noted...  One should apply some era adjustment to this efficiency statistic. Interior defense in the NBA is worse than it ever has been, by leaps and bounds.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective FG% in the NBA. All are obviously active players. Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are active."
"Nah, Wiggins played like Wiggins always does, Jimmy did underperform, but still was the best player for the Timberwolves in that series.  KAT on other hand was absolute hot garbage, he made Clint Capela look like prime Dwight Howard and was the main reason why the Timberwolves got blown off the building by Houston. KAT has the skills to be the best big man in the league, especially on offense, but he is soft, that's why Jimmy doesn't respect him.  Kinda crazy how much of a polar opposite that KAT is to KG, who is the guy that he was supposed to succeed in Minnesota, both extremely skilled as big men, but one is soft like charmin and the other was a crazy maniac."
"KAT is a damn talented player but this is such a tough position for him.  Butler was in Minny for one season and they had their sole playoff appearance in 15+ years. He then goes on to find post season success in both Philly and especially Miami.   Meanwhile, KAT’s only postseason appearance resulted in him getting locked down and outplayed by Clint Capela.   There’s levels to this. Respect your elders."
Clint Capela completely outplayed in the 2018 playoffs.
"My East team this year is the Hawks, lots of overlooked talent on that team, very deep, and I’m a big Trae Young and Clint Capela fan. In the West, I like the Jazz just to shut up all the people calling them frauds and the Mavs because my buddy is a big Luka fan.   If I had it my way though, the Wizards would sweep the Nets on the way to Russ’ first ring."
"&gt;Big men are not getting the same quality shots if the three point line doesn't exist.    That's true, but I'm referring to the shots they got without the arc.  Nowadays, bigs routinely shoot way over 50%.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in effective FG%.  11 of the 20 all-time are currently active bigs.  &gt;You can watch tape of games before the line was introduced  Believe it or not, some of us played basketball before the arc.  We don't need to watch tape.  &gt; and see how cramped the paint was  And bigs still shot better than Curry does, most years.  The median seasonal effective FG% is .478, and most bigs are north of the median most of the time, almost by definition."
"Well he's actively hurting his team while he's amassing those rebounds so I'd say we can definitely hold it against him. If he was used like Clint Capela he could be a positive asset but he still thinks he can be a star for some reason.  Badly missing a shot then grabbing your own rebound and missing again isn't any better than if he never got the rebound in the first place. The only shots he should be taking are dunks, anything else is a wasted possession."
"&gt;It's not even about Zion, nobody is getting called at the rim anymore  That's questionable.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in effective FG%, in NBA history.  11 of the top 20 all-time are currently-active bigs.  Those guys are not shooting threes, and they are converting their shots at unprecedented rates -- because interior defense is virtually non-existent in today's NBA."
The poison pill for putting both Embiid and Jokic on the first team is finding a Center for the 3rd team. Do you really want KAT or Vooch or Clint Capela to be All-NBA just so you don't have to decide between Embiid or Jokic?
"I’m not counting the Nets, Lakers or Clippers because super teams built through free agency are little to do with teams front offices.  But let’s look at the other teams.    Sixers -  Egregiously tanked and looks like they can win a chip.    Knicks - failed tanking.  Didn’t get good until they made smart free agency moves by getting Randle   Hawks - We are good because deepest team in the east due to FA moves.  Trae arguably isn’t a top 25 players.    Celtics -  Didn’t take but made good trades to give Draft capital.  Remained competitive without stars.   Heat -  Found Bam late lottery and surrounded him with shooters also found later in the draft then brought in Butler to take em to the next level.   Suns - Tanking didn’t work.  Booker is the main guy and they found him late lottery.  I like Ayton but they could have gotten a Clint Capela level center in FA or trade and have been just as good.  They then traded for CP3 to become great.    Mavs - Tanked one year and then surrounded Luka with actual talent.     You conveniently left off teams like the Pelicans, Timberwolves, Kings who have perpetually tanked and remain at the bottom of the league with stars on their rosters."
" &gt;	even though he’s a big, strong, mobile guy, he’s not a rim protector on the level of someone like Myles Turner, Clint Capela, or Brook Lopez.  Oh? Then how do you explain [this beautiful example of rim protection](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n6pfa3/highlight_andre_drummond_beautiful_display_of/)? I mean how do you score on this man"
"Andre Drummond is probably the most disappointing big in the league.   His size, mobility, and ability to leverage that size and strength should make him a good traditional center and he just isn't.   He's awful with the ball in his hands (no ball skills and bad touch around the rim), his shot selection is bad (steady diet of inefficient back-to-the-basket post-ups), and even though he's a big, strong, mobile guy, he's not a rim protector on the level of someone like Myles Turner, Clint Capela, or Brook Lopez."
The only other one in all-NBA competition is probably Clint Capela. He might be able to sneak onto the third team because of this.

"&gt;The right guy with the right skill set could abuse these mini centers  It doesn't even require much of a skill set.

"Trae Young, Clint Capela, John Collin?"
"&gt; Obviously he ended up being right so kudos to him, but Jokic is really the exception not the rule when it comes to good advanced stats on low volume players.  People say this every year, and it's just not true. This happens all the time. [Back in 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071122115204/http://ballhype.com/story/the_paul_millsap_doctrine/), you had articles talking about this phenomenon, finding that players forced into more minutes actually *improved* with the larger role. They called it the Paul Millsap doctrine, based on his stellar per-minute play as Carlos Boozer's backup holding up excellently when Boozer got injured and he became a starter.  There's been tons of examples of it ever since.  * James Harden put up great per-minute scoring numbers on an insane .660 TS% in his last year in OKC (back in 11-12, that TS% was even more impressive than it is now), and then people were shocked that he continued to be an amazing scorer when he went to Houston. * Clint Capela averaged 13 and 8 on 64% shooting in 24 mpg in 16-17; a couple years later, he averaged 17 and 13 on 65% shooting in 33 mpg. His per-minute and per-possession stats were basically unchanged; he just was on the floor for more time per game. * Christian Wood came off the bench for his first 50 games last season; he averaged 22 points and 11 rebounds per 36 on 66% TS, in an 18 mpg role. He became a starter for the last 12 games when Drummond was shut down; he put up 23 points and 10 rebounds per 36 on 65% TS in the larger role, playing 35 mpg. This year, as a full-time starter in Houston, he's again averaging 23 and 11 per 36.  I could go on for a while. There are going to be some failure modes here; you can't extrapolate a tiny sample, and if someone plays only 5 mpg in garbage time that's not the same as even a 24 mpg role. Maybe you adjust a guy's performance down a couple percentage points for fatigue, though you could also adjust it up due to finding more of a rhythm in the game.  And Jokic showed his greatness early too. As a rookie, he was averaging 10-7-2 in 22 minutes on .580 TS%. There was nothing at all ridiculous about saying he was better than Porzingis (14-7-1 in 28 minutes on .518 TS%). Per possession, Jokic did almost everything better, which explains why all advanced stats had him significantly better.

Clint Capela is having a huge impact and has a third of the offensive game that shaq did

"I mean Clint is a much more impactful defender by every metric than Simmons. He's just a part of far more possessions  Embiid missed a bunch of games this season and even though he's been great in those games, Capela's still been a touch better IMO.  Bam just doesn't have the same impact Capela does because of his so-so rebounding and lack of shot deterrence relative to bigger centers, although I suspect he'll translate better defensively in the playoffs."
"I have only watched like 7 Miami games this season, 2 of them were vs the hawks where Clint capela looked much more impactful. Both are pretty comparable in advanced stats, depending on which ones you value more it will say Clint or bam is better. Bam is a better perimeter defender and Clint is a better rim protector. If I had to pick on to have on my team long term I would pick bam, but if I had to pick the more deserving player for defensive accolades solely based on basketball played this year I would go with Clint."
Clint Capela
"Yep, despite being the 5th seed in the East the hawks players have gotten zero accolades because we are not a media darling team. The fact that vucevic got an all star appearance over Clint Capela was solely because of numbers hype and a crowd of people constantly saying he was underrated to the point where he became massively overrated."
"&gt; ESPN's Zach Lowe reported Wednesday the tension between Howard and Harden **led the superstar guard to ask the coaching staff to come off the bench so he could play more minutes with Clint Capela**, though sources told Lowe it was a ""facetious"" request aimed at getting Capela on the first unit full time.  Lmfao"
"&gt;&gt; the tension between Howard and Harden led the superstar guard to ask the coaching staff to come off the bench so he could play more minutes with Clint Capela, though sources told Lowe it was a ""facetious"" request aimed at getting Capela on the first unit full time.  i used to do stuff like this when i was like 6 lol."
Clint Capela is who dumb people think Andre Drummond is
"I mean rebounding is a good skill but unlike every other major skill such as shooting or defense, you cannot just bank on rebounding to be good in the league. You need other things  This is the difference between Clint Capela and Andre Drummond"

"&gt;For EXAMPLE, RAPTOR has Clint Capela as the 7th best player in the league right now  no it doesnt. capela has the 7th highest RAPTOR. every person who has created a metric has made it clear that it's NOT what you are attempting to do right now.  but anyway, russ' impact is not top 25 per any of the four most prominent impact metrics. but you just want to look at triple doubles lmfao  &gt;I think it's weird to remember ppls usernames on an anonymous forum but u can do u.

"Um, metrics can be flawed? They're just as much a stat as anything else. For EXAMPLE, RAPTOR has Clint Capela as the 7th best player in the league right now. It also has Rudy Gobert as the 2nd.

"One should apply some era adjustment to this stat.  Interior defense in the NBA is worse than it ever has been, by leaps and bounds.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective FG% in the NBA.  All are obviously active players.  Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are active."
"&gt;mchale would smoke most bigs today with his post moves  Everyone would.  Interior defense doesn't even exist in the NBA anymore.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective field-goal percentage.  Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are currently active.  The biggest challenge McHale -- or anyone else -- would have is getting teammates to pass him the ball, instead of jacking up threes."
Clint Mothafuckin Capela.  Yes that’s really his middle name.  Also shoutout solomon hill. He’s nowhere near as impactful as Capela but he does do the dirty work as well.
"LeBron has played 10,811 playoff minutes, which is more than the regular season minutes any player from the 2016 draft class except Buddy Hield (10,906). He has more playoff minutes than Cody Zeller's regular season minutes, and he was drafted in 2013. More than Clint Capela, Rodney Hood, Joe Harris, and TJ Warren who have been in the league for seven years. More than Kelly Oubre or D'Angelo Russell. More than anyone from 2017 even if you include their playoff minutes.  Crazy durability."
"Thybulle is great but gets bench minutes. Embiid rarely plays alongside him. I'm not going to deny Ben's perimeter defense, but there's a reason why the defense has always been great with Embiid, even before Simmons turned into the wing defender he is now.   Capela maybe, but he doesn't have the mobility of Joel. Myles, just like Clint, can chase blocks, but they don't quite deter shots like Embiid. Turner too especially is BBQ chicken in the post, even if that's an afterthought in most matchups."
"Gotta love Clint Capela getting shown but not Rudy Gobert. Clint Capela is great but like, come on."
"almost definitely single digits. when he played with harden in, he only got 8, and that’s with clint capela only being around for half the season and being the only rebounder to play more than 1000 minutes. give him the same relative lack of ball handling with lebron but have love and drummond taking up lots of rebounds, he wouldn’t be able to rack them up."

Brave of you to call Plagiarized Clint Capela The Next Great
"Homer here but because I watch all of the raptors games, it’s Lowry.  The shit he does, the timing of his aggression, his defensive willingness to win, it’s all the intangibles and when you see the team with him on vs off the court it’s so clear that the guy is a winner.   Also - demars assist game is developing so well. Impressive.   KAT is so fucking good. His 3pt shooting alone is elite. But everyone shits on the guy constantly. If he was a laker he’d be sucked off by half this sub  Joe Harris is obvs having a career year thanks to all the spacing he’s getting, but for that team to be able to chuck the ball around a little bit and dump it out to Harris is ludicrous.   He’s always hurt but Gordon Hayward is such an integral part of winning. Boston misses his playmaking and outside shooting clearly. And he’s helped Charlotte become a winning team.   Clint capela - without him Atlanta is in the play in. His rebounding, offensive in particular, keeps them alive."
Clint Capela
"That's just wrong. We have had really bad players some years, yes, but we have also had players like Clint Capela, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Eric Gordon (when he was playing well). They are not below average roleplayers. Also PJ tucker was absolutely deadly with the corner 3. Maybe not as good as Joe Harris but he was still above league average."
"Harden can carry the posters in this thread to the playoffs.   Through 46 games in the middle of 18/19, Harden averaged 39/8/7 on 62.2% TS. In this period, Clint Capela missed 15 games, Chris Paul missed 21, Gordon 10 and Danuel House 18. The only players healthy in this period were Austin Rivers, PJ Tucker, Gerald Green &amp; Nene Hilario. The Rockets were 29-17.  He's more or less proven he can carry G-Leaguers to a playoff win-rate."
Hawks have an even worse defense so does that mean Clint Capela is a bad defender? What a terrible rebuttal.
Yeah cuz he has Clint Capela covering most of his mistakes inside lmao
the Clint Capela effect
Steph is putting up 31ppg on 66%TS while having the least spacing of any superstar in the league.  James Harden is amazing and they're both uniquely different with their scoring arsenal but the idea that Steph couldn't average 36ppg on the same efficiency is absurd.  Replace James Harden with Steph on that 2018/2019 roster and give him free reign to run PNR to his heart's content with Clint Capela while being surrounded by 3pt shooters and you don't think he could comfortably average 36ppg?
"Harden would absolutely beast with a hall of fame caliber big as the best he's had was a 2015 Dwight who was good but past his prime, a young Clint Capela who he almost made the finals with in 2018, and he's made DJ look like a starting caliber center in Brooklyn and was balling with Claxton  &amp;#x200B;  On the flip side, Hakeem with a hall of fame perimeter creator would be insane as the best he got was Clyde Drexler who made the all star team in 95 I think but not the superstar he was in Portland. Drexler was good enough for Hakeem to win the chip in 95 not to even mention he won with Otis Thorpe as the 2nd best player the year prior  &amp;#x200B;  If u combine the two and get Hakeem and Harden, now thats just legendary. Steph and Hakeem would also be great but I like the 2 man game possibilities better with Harden"

If we can't get him involved more with them two don't know how much more we can get him involved. It seems like half of Bookers TO's are him trying to give Ayton the ball, I sometimes wish Booker just shoots the ball instead or passes it to another 3 point shooter rather than feed Ayton but that is mainly on Book.

Clint Capela spoke facts
"And wow, 6th! I’ll be telling my grandkids about that. What a privilege it is to watch Clint fucking Capela play defense. You know what, I bet if I was 7 feet tall I’d be able to block 2 shots per game."
If you think Clint Capela is a better defender than Joel Embiid then you are trippin.  Embiid anchored the second best defense.
"Man if you think Clint Capela is a better defensive player than Joel Embiid then you should test your piss.  Nate McMillan is great. But to think he turned Clint suddenly into an all-league defender is absurd, sir."
"Oh wow, did Nate McMillan change Capela’s ability? His defensive prowess? Wow! Nate should be hired by everyone! Apparently he can turn Clint Capela into Dikembe Mutumbo."
Whoa….Clint Capela was right.
The way Embiid fell was very unnatural. Lucky he didn’t have a major injury. Clint capela should be tried and sentenced to 2 life sentences and should be kept in isolation for at least 20 years
All you need to be is a 57.4% FT shooter to equal the 1.148 points per possession that the Clippers had this season to lead the league. You need to be just a 54.4% FT shooter to match the 15th best (average) points per possession this season  The qualifying player with the lowest FT percentage this year was Clint Capela at…. 57.3%. The player with at least 100 attempts with the lowest FT percentage this year was Steven Adams at 44.4% and there were exactly 4 other players who fit this category and had a lower FT% than Capela  There is very little being asked of Ben Simmons and he is not coming close to meeting it  And it’s clear this will never become a mainstream activity that you see in every game because so few players are actually bad enough at shooting FT to be worth hacking every time. And the ones that are don’t even play enough to be unbenchable
He doesn’t get a pass. It’s his team. He’s the guy and it’s his job to get this fixed when it’s that fucking bad. Dogshit shots and missed free throws at the end. He was awful and stars don’t get to point at a good game as an excuse. Unless he wants to be a role guy. He couldn’t do anything in the end vs Clint Capela. Kawhi never gets that excuse (because superstars don’t want it)   Tobis play is a joke. But so is the rest of the team aside from Seth. Furkan dribbled off his toe twice tonight and had to get fouled to find points. Ben is scared of the ball. Tobi was even with Solomon Hill in output. Shake jacked dogshit up and kept praying. Dwight couldn’t catch a pass from a 5 year old. This is all dog shit.    It’s the opposite of the Jason Kelce speech. These dudes all get talked up and they proved all those people wrong by being absolute shit
CLINT CAPELA DID NOTHING WRONG
CLINT CAPELA WAS RIGHT YOU MOTHERFUCKERS
Clint Capela post game interview going to be cute.
Embiid is just abusing Clint Capela. I feel sorry for him
"Clint Capela: ""yeah we want to get to get him fatigu--"
"knicks had a good defense this year but 76ers defense is great  knicks actually were respectable defensively against the hawks, just our offense was garbo  clint capela singlehandedly won that series for them with his interior defense, he gave us nothing"
Lol Clint Capela you dipshit.
"Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Clint Capela, John Collins, and Bogdan have all collided while diving for a loose ball at center court, exploding in a giant mushroom cloud. Wells Fargo Center has been reduced to rubble."
"I saw the quote as clint saying embiid got worn out, which was true last game but yeah lol joel feasting bad tn. Its nuts how good capela is against normal centers versus this. embiid just a freak"
I sincerely hope Clint Capela starts taking some Mandarin lessons this offseason
Has Clint Capela thought about making Embiid tired to slow him down? I thought he figured out how to stop Embiid.
Clint Capela is going to turn into MVP KG next year in Turkey.
"Brb, scrubbing all evidence of my ""Clint Capela was snubbed in DPOY voting"" article from the Internet."
Nah Embiid is literally dicking down Clint Capela on national TV right now
&gt;Hawks' Clint Capela Believes He Has Sixers' Joel Embiid Figured Out
Clint Capela wishing he was still a Houston Rocket RN.
imagine being clint capela and talking shit to a guy who had annihilated you every single time you've both been on the floor
The evisceration of Clint Capela
Clint Capela a machine at the free throw line !
Clint Capela really should have kept his mouth shut lmfao. Imagine giving more fuel to a player who’s already superior than you in every way.
Guys I think Joel Embiid might be better than Clint Capela. Just found out in this game thread
Clint Capela talking shit about the opponent while they come back with a vengeance and he doesn’t do shit   Name a more iconic duo
"“God I hope he gets tired soon so I have a chance” - Clint Capela, probably"
Clint Capela is far far far far too average a basketball player to talk the amount of shit he does  Stay humble kiddo

Clint “Joel Stopper” Capela ab to come out and say he meant Pryzbilla
Clint Capela has to be the dumbest man on Earth for disrespecting Embiid after last game
Clint Capela poked the bear
Clint Capela is on another planet right now.
"“We were making his job tougher contesting everything,"" Capela said after the game in regards to Embiid. ""Making him work. Whenever you wear him out, everything becomes tougher for him. That’s how I knew it was a long series and when the fatigue comes in. . . It’s a different ballgame.  [Article with the quote](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/76ers/.amp/news/hawks-clint-capela-sixers-joel-embiid-figured-out)  Basically it’s weird to act like he’s “figured out” Embiid after one bad half (game 4), when Embiid has an injured knee and previously dropped 40 on his head."
Clint Capela lookin like shit rn
Clint Capela is so obviously intimated by Embiid on both ends that it's pathetic.  His total softness around the basket has made him a complete nonfactor
clint capela finished third in defensive player of the year and john collns is almost in the 50/40/90 club.  4th seed in the east. also they also play on a team with trae young who takes majority of the shoots
"“If you cut off his legs, everything becomes tougher for him. When the amputation comes in, it’s a different ballgame,” -Clint Capela"
"Clint Capela On Joel Embiid: ""Whenever you ~~wear him out~~ tear his meniscus, everything becomes tougher for him. When the ~~fatigue comes in~~ meniscus gets torn, it's a different ballgame."""
"Nah, embiid is actually healthy enough to play right now, so obviously not that far off from his peak. Especially with the numbers he's put up. Hunter and Cam, our two best defensive players not named Clint Capela, aren't healthy enough to play and we tied the series 2-2."
"Lol a word to the wise, quit while you're ahead.  You're in a bit over your head here.    &amp;#x200B;  1.  I bring up Joel's 21 rebounds because you tried to make it seem like he wasn't effective on defense.  He was, to the tune of 21 rebounds, and he altered multiple drives by the Hawks that won't show up in the box score.  The Hawks are the best lob team in the NBA.  If you look at which point guards have passed the most lobs to which big men this season Trae to John Collins and Trae to Clint Capela are both in the top 10.  If embiid was not in the game it would have been lob city in the A last night and the Hawks would have won by more.  Period.   2. The hawks have the leading rebounder in the NBA in Clint Capela, are 14th in offensive rebounds and 6th in defensive rebounds.  But they're not a good rebounding team.  Sure.   3. Saying that a team would play better if their most inefficient offensive player didn't shoot the ball as much is a lazy argument and not actual basketball analysis, hence why I haven't acknowledged it.  You literally would have to assume that other players would pick up the slack when Seth Curry was the only 76er starter that had a good shooting night.   Trae and Bogi combined for like 12/50 last night, maybe if they would have just not taken those shots in the first half the Hawks would have won by 20.  See how dumb this argument is?    &amp;#x200B;  Are we finished here yet?"
Clint Capela and talking shit before a game 5. Name a better duo.

"Completely agree with these teams. I think Clint Capela deserves a nod but in fairness, I can’t see who he would replace.   I know it’s not exactly a new take, but Matisse is one of the most impactful defenders I’ve ever witnessed. He seems to have this knack of almost teleporting into position to grab a steal or contest a shot. If he can develop a good offensive game or at minimum a reliable 3, he’s going to become one of the most coveted players in the league."
Steve Nash hasn’t shown to be that smart. Steve Kerr would have done that in game 3 and 4. That’s what he did to shut down Dwight Howard and Clint Capela against Houston
"We would have still been a lottery team, but being where we were the past 2 seasons only *slightly* better would have likely meant no DeAndre Hunter, no Cam Reddish, no Onyeka Okongwu, and probably no Clint Capela since that deal hinged on our draft capital."
Look I hate the sixers as much as the next person but Joel has been dominating all playoffs  and he has a PARTIALLY TORN MENISCUS. The hawks are a talented team and Clint capela isn’t a scrub. Shit happens so don’t overreact and see how the series turns out.
"I don’t disagree because it’s hard to argue with what the Hawks have done at all.  But if you gave Luka the shooters the Hawks have with a rim runner like Capela that can defend, I think Clint Capela would solve almost every problem the Mavericks have. I would swap he for KP in a heartbeat.   44% from Bogdan, 41% from Gallo, 40% from Collins, 36% from Huerter."
"And opposing center Clint Capela went reddit's favorite number 6/9 from the field.  Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
"The fact that things are not going optimally for a team doesn’t automatically justify change for change’s sake. If Embiid missed the next two games and the Hawks got blown out in both, that wouldn’t mean that it’s time to trade Clint Capela for scrap metal and second round picks."
"Welp, Clint Capela dunked on Joel Embiid in the playoffs.  Time to start ""EMBIID GETS PLAYED OFF THE COURT IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!"" slander?"
CLINT the CLOWN CAPELA
Clint “JR Smith” Capela
Embiid is not getting called for anything. The man just pushed Clint Capela off the court.
"Clint Capela ended up being an absolute steal by the Hawks. Great move, GM!"
"shaq was right on, clint capela is playing soft. sadly, there is nothing he can do about it as embiid simply owns him."
I would put Collins on Embiid and Capela on Simmons. Get Clint off the perimeter so we have protection at the rim.

"Which Rockets team are you talking about specifically?  The 2016-17 team was basically comprised of Harden-Pat Beverley-Trevor Ariza-Ryan Anderson-Clint Capela-Eric Gordon as its main rotation.   I don’t think a lineup of KD-Joe Harris-Bruce Brown-Blake Griffin-Nick Claxton any less talented.  Citing their PPG during a season in which they played with three guys that averaged 25+ doesn’t make much sense because of course their scoring burden was lessened. I’m talking talent and tools.  Claxton is in his second season to Clint’s third at the time, Joe Harris is the best shooter on either team, Blake’s passing out of the short role would have been huge for that Rockets team (as would Jeff Green’s ability to attack the rim or dish to shooters)."
"Contract value is a huge part of why GMs use analytics. Is PJ Tucker better than Clint Capela? No. But is he better for half the price, on a team where the owner restricts your spending and you need to squeeze every possible dollar in order to build a deeper roster? Absolutely."
Clint Capela is top 6 in DPOY voting.
Well meniscus tear Embiid is definitely outperforming Giannis against Clint Capela who finished 6th in DPOY voting.  Embiid- 35/10/5 on 66% TS against the Hawks  Giannis- 30/12/3 on 52% TS against the Nets
"&gt; EDIT: Like what do you call Malcolm Brogdon, Terry Rozier, Goran Dragic, FVV, Dejounte Murray, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela  those are all role players lol, you can make an arbitrary separation between ""role player"" and ""role player who starts and has a bigger role"" if you want, but by all accounts they are still role players. Other than Dragic is there one allstar on that list?  By your definition, someone like Lou Dort stopped being a role player once he started and got the green light to take more than 9-10 shots a game. OG Anunoby isn't a role player because he starts and plays multiple roles on the court? A 3&amp;D player is basically the most sought after role player and that's a guy who can pass decently, drive decently, shoot very good, play defense very good. That's a multi-faceted player (Covington, Beverly, etc.) yet still a role player."
"There’s a significant difference between CP and Jimmy in that Jimmy’s vocal about when you’re stepping out of your role, but CP is really great about communicating the limits and specifications of your role before you do too much. And Jimmy’s even said as much (that interview he did on JJ’s podcast gave a lot of insight into this). It’s a difference in leadership style that makes Jimmy a more feast or famine leader than CP.   CP’s worked to get the most out of young guys on his team his whole career. We’ve seen guys under 25 have great showings on his teams. Off the top of my head Eric Bledsoe, DeAndre Jordan, Clint Capela, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, and now DA, Cam Johnson and Bridges all got great starts to their careers by getting guided by CP on how to to fit their games around him because CP is one of the all time great floor conductors. Paul’s just always on time and that consistency is great for young players.  My only concern for a CP/KAT pairing would be if KAT would be reduced to a rim running center I think that’s a waste of his 3 level scoring game."

Clint Capela was talking all that shit when he played a team with their starting center out…. Back to reality you go
"No one thinks Rudy is Steph. No one says that.   But the most causal fans in the world say dumb shit like “Rudy is terrible at offense” and that’s not even close to true   People cite Rudy’s efficiency to argue he’s not trash. Not to say he’s Steph, lol.   Rudy gives you most of what Clint Capela does on offense, while being the best defensive C of his generation"
You guys need Clint Capela
Embiid has been better this playoffs than Giannis he's averaging 30/8 on 60% shooting and is averaging 40/11 in 2 games against the Hawks and Clint Capela who is one of the best defensive centers in the league  His game is far less limited as he's not only bigger but has a great midrange and faceup shot and can also shoot the 3
"IDK if the perception of KAT has changed, but I posted that take in some older hot takes thread and got heat because people said his defense sucked and he was “soft.”  Maybe the Capela thing sounds like a hotter take if I phrase it as “Clint Capela is a top 30 player” or “Clint Capela is the fifth best center in the league?”"
"Unrelated but may I please join the Hawks for the playoffs? Trae is electric and I’m frustrated that the Hawks have made great moves while the Mavericks fucking haven’t. We got the two best players of the 2018 draft, both teams were essentially blank skates, build around your guy, and the Hawks surrounded theirs with fucking awesome players. And the Mavs...  I would love to have Clint Capela, John Collins, Gallo, Hunter, Huerter and Bogdan on my team, so I will adopt the Hawks for the rest of the playoffs"
"* If Karl Anthony Towns could stay healthy, he’d be the same caliber of All-NBA center as Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert. * Gobert is easily a Top 15 player in the league. * Clint Capela is a borderline All-Star and one of the most underrated players in the league. * I’d sooner have De’Aaron Fox or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander than Ben Simmons."
"At this point, the offense running through Giannis isn’t working. Use him like Clint Capela… PNR with Jrue as the main ball handler. Blake with use drop coverage, and Jrue with have space to attack. Giannis will attack the rim (as the rim runner), which will force someone on the backside to help, leading to an open 3. Run the PNR until the Nets pre-switch the matchups, then you do a soft post up for Giannis and let him use his length to get to the basket.   PnR is very predictable, but effective. Too bad it’s not random so Bud could actually use it."
Sounds like clint capela. That's not such a bad thing
Calling for more PnR for Giannis doesn’t make him a Clint Capela.
You guys don’t realize you’re telling on yourself by calling for Giannis to be used like Clint Capela.
"He’s a promising young white player. Redditors always seem to attach themselves to random white players who do something well a few times or in limited minutes. We had people saying we should bench Capela for Hartenstein a couple seasons back because Hartenstein had **one** good game in between plenty of shitty games. Fucking Isaiah Harentstein, over Clint fucking Capela. And they were serious."
"Well, as biased you are, so will I be in a way. But bias is nothing to frown upon or to discredit, it's also a show of preference right?  First reason - Availability. Both guys were drafted in 2014. Since then, Embiid missed almost 300 games, compared to played in 260. Jokic played every game this year, and with short offseason they had, it's really outsanding feature.  Other thing that basically limits the availability is injury proneness. Knock on wood, Jokic is way more durable than JoJo, and I hope Joel stays injury free from this part of his career, if I am being totally honest. But it is as it is right now, and Jokic has that on his side.   Passing - Easy take, no need for further explanation.  Scoring - Jokic is just as effective as Joel is, and scored 2 less points with averaging significantly less FTA. That can be explained that Jokic doesn't go as much to the paint as Joel, but one factor more is that Jokic wasn't always getting the whistle in his favor. He did in Portland series, which got me really surprised, but 1st game against Suns he once again had 0 FTA. With that on the side, Jokic makes 8.4 assists per game, which is #6th best average in the league.  Defense - Without a doubt this is Joel's category. But not by a long shot these analysts try to present it as. Jokic isn't the monster blocker, but can have a game with 5 blocks in a most random way ever. Jokic averages 0.7/0.8 blocks per game and for a guy who is 7"" it's not the best average, but Embiid averaged 1.4, which is way less than other defensive centers were doing. Jokic also adds 1.3 steal per game, and it's a defensive category, compared to Joels 1. They average just about the same rebounds. ***However*** going in the paint and seeing Embiid is way scarier than seing Jokic. But it's not like Jokic can't block.  Jokic is also at top of his game all season long, 15 TD's and 60 double doubles. It's wild.  As for the performance in the playoffs, Jokic had a better first round, without a doubt. Not the best, but better. And he basically carried Denver against the Portland, who despite what people like Perkins are saying, are a decent defensive team when Nurkic is playing. As far for the Suns series, it's gotten to the point where his playing for 6/7 months straight is taking it's toll. And let's be honest, Ayton is one tough motherfucker. He's way above over Capela, both defensive and offensive wise. No tough love for Clint tho and Hawks tho (can't hate them for Bogi reasons), but Suns are tougher cookie.   Both players are great, but I'd take a guy who I can rely on basically whole season and carry it in playoffs. Love Embiid tho, but love Jokic more. And I can't hate a guy whose [childhood hero was Jokic](https://youtu.be/LU62fJxgB3I). All jokes, nothing but love for a great sport that is Embiid. Im rooting for Atlanta now, for Bogi reasons again, but if you guys go through, im for you all the way"
"Caldwell-Pope is 2 names away from Jimmy Butler and 3 from Clint Capela, so maybe intended to click one of those two?"
no Javala McGee is average and not a starter. Dwight Howard now is average but not a starter.   Rudy Gobert is a starting DPOY level centre who averages a double double. 70% of that is pretty high when you're the best in the game on defence.   Clint Capela is a good example but he also gets paid 20+ million
Marcus Smart is not better than Clint Capela or Andrew Wiggins
Man your blind homerism is really showing. Did you really just call him Clint Capela with elite passing ability? Either you don’t watch Capela who was nearly All-NBA caliber this season or you don’t understand what elite passing ability really is in the NBA. What a garbage take
"&gt; Rob Williams is a great back up big  You don't really watch the Celtics do you?  He's Clint Capela with elite passing ability.    &gt; TT was an awful signing.   That's just silly.  They used the MLE on him.  Who else was out there that would have been a better spend of the MLE?  He'll flirt with a double double and give you some toughness and defense down low.  He is what he is, the signing was solid."
Hawks for Clint Capela
"How were the Sixers the better team against the Hawks when they lost a seven game series? The Sixers had home court for the last game, a superstar center, and substantially more playoff experience aside from Lou Will and Clint Capela. You can't be the better team while ""giving away three games in a series""."
Agreed.    \* High-scoring point guard   \* Jump-shooting two guard   \* Zion dominates athletically   \* Kirilenko is a do-it-all stretch four   \* McDyess is a budget Clint Capela (rim-running five)  AK-47 or Zion could take turns running crazy pick and rolls with McDyess against lots of teams.
Clint capela hyperextended Giannis' knee
"I’ve had this argument a couple times and don’t really feel like going to get the actual numbers but  Harden shooting percentages with Dort on him were pathetic, he scored more on Dennis despite having a FRACTION of the time guarded. He was extremely inefficient when Dort specifically was on him.   He was effective in fact that the Houston Rockets, an isolation team, had to SWITCH into becoming a PNR team with the sole purpose of getting Dort off Harden. After Hardens game 2-3(Dort did not play game 1), they ran the second most screens they did in any game the entire season including when they had Clint Capela.   Not to mention just the sheer eye test of Harden struggling to get passed him to a point in which Dantoni tried to have him down low in the post.   We have not seen that level of individual defensive impact in the playoffs in recent times."
"The rockets hitting a ceiling wasn’t due to harden though wtf? In 2017 they lost CP3 and even then it still took 0-27 (and in that respect, the refs waved off 3 made 3s by harden in that stretch) to barely claw out a game 7. A year later, it was Chris Paul being shit for 5-6 games and Clint capela getting played off the floor.   The rockets ceiling was more a function of having to play against the goat team than it was harden, because without the warriors, the rockets very likely have at least one ring by now"
"&gt;No he \[Klay\] didn’t \[outplay Harden\] Not an ounce of help for harden  23.4 PPG on 45/44/86 splits and 2 turnovers/game + lockdown defense + winning the series in 5&gt;&gt;26.6 PPG on 41/31/84 splits and 5 turnovers per game.  &gt;My ass lmao. Harden was suppose to beat 4 allstars by himself without Cp3 lol?  Firstly, ""by himself"" is very disingenous here. Harden had 2 great defenders/good role players in PJ Tucker and Trevor Ariza + Eric Gordon playing the best playoff series of his life and Clint Capela.  And I mean yeah you guys would have won if not for the massive B2B meltdowns in games 6 and 7. Ya'll were up 17 after the first quarter and up 10 at halftime of game 6 then ended up losing by 29. You were only down 7 going into the 4th quarter of game 6 then Harden had 0 points on 0/2 shooting with 2 turnovers in the 4th quarter, which you got outscored by 22 in.  Game 7 obviously was the 27 straight missed 3s with 10 by Harden game, which you also blew a double digit halftime lead in. And again, there's no way to say that having CP3 guarantees you would have won. Maybe you don't get off to such a fast start in either game if he plays."
Clint Capela gets paid 16 million a year  This is absolutely ridiculous
"So you argument is that Collins who averaged 7.4 rebounds during the season is a better rebounder than Wood, who averaged 9.6 rebounds?  You are obviously just some nonsense fake Rockets fan, you don't even know that Clint Capela is Swiss"
"Crowder got hit hard by Pat one time. Every other foul he got was bullshit. Pat needs to do something about throwing his arms and elbows how he does. He got Clint Capela in the eye really bad last series, and he got Crowder good last night."
"The SuperSonics move to Oklahoma City.  I become disenfranchised with the NBA.  Few years later I start playing 2K.  I dunno man, something about Clint Capela.  I feel that instant connection.  The only other big man I can remotely relate to is John the Baptist.  (Brandon Clarke wasn’t in the league yet but I love his game too.).  John gets Trae to partner with.  I’m not a huge fan of Harden (he’s got OKC stink on him) so I settle with my backup fav and start adopting the Hawks as my main team.  Start following the team, watching the occasional game.  Rebuilding is tough.  Clint gets traded to the Hawks.  I swear my undying fealty to this team of gods on the spot.  Some things just happen that way.  EDIT:  I point out to my dad that he can say “Go Hawks”.  He joins the bandwagon as well.  It helps, actually."
"big men have have always gone high in the draft, so I would not extrapolate too much from that, just look at the 2018 draft where both Ayton &amp; Bagley went ahead of Luka Doncic.  I do think we're seeing a new era of more skilled bigs, which makes sense as the game continues to evolve into a more 5 out style game with tons of emphasis on shooting &amp; creation.  But bigs with the Jokic/Embiid/KAT skillset are super, duper rare and will continue to be just because there's fewer giants in the world than there are guard/wing body-types.  Think about who the 10th best wing (anyone 6'5""-6'8"") is the the NBA vs. the 10th best big-man, someone like Jaylen Brown/Jimmy Butler (this is off the top of my head, don't nit-pick too much) has so much more impact than the 10th best big (someone like Clint Capela or Sabonis), and if you looked went further the supply of wings stays deep &amp; the pool of bigs dries up quickly."
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7.

Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."

"Exactly Giannis handles, mobility and the way he gets to the paint is just beautiful. That spin move against Clint Capela was 🤌🏿"
2021 Suns MVP finalists:  - Solomon Hill 🔥🔥🔥  - Joe Ingles 🥶🥶🥶  - Andrew Wiggins 🥵🥵🥵  - Clint Capela 😈😈😈
Clint Capela would take the ball off the rim and get like 3 more rebounds per game
"Harden played without Eric Gordon, Clint Capela and Chris Paul for multiple stretches at a time while maintaining elite offensive TEAM efficiency. Curry could shoot crazy well for month and still only had a mediocre one. And again...Curry's hot stretch was for a month and they missed the playoffs. Harden took his team to the 4th seed while averaging 40 for 3 months on elite efficiency."
Clint Capela on the Hawks lol
Clint Capela had the second highest PnR usage this season with no outside game
"Reddish showed a lot of improvement from his 1st month to the last month of his rookie season, look at his stats month by month. Reddish was hurt for like 65% of this season but he looked good in the playoffs. He has 2 more season left on his rookie deal so the hawks have time there.  I don’t think Huerter will get close to a max, but he is an important glue guy who should be re signed.  I think Collins is a bit overrated, he is a product of trae and he struggles to create his own shot. Plus he is a negative defender when he isn’t playing alongside Clint capela"
"huh who was he supposed to pass to pj tucker to post up clint capela to shoot threes lmao u do realize there was no pnr find the open guy things bc they switched the pnr and im not talking about guys like lopez switching guys like iggy, klay, kd, draymond and if u watched u would see that most possesions curry was guarding pj tucker so tucker would screen for harden and then curry would hedge until the defender guarding harden got back on him so then harden would pass to tucker who was then asked to do something on a 4-3 but most of the times he would just give it back to harden for an iso or bc of harden getting doubled tucker found gusy like gordon for threes but every time that didn't happer yes harden was asked to shoot contested threes"
I kind of agree with you.  I think he is a really good center miscast as mvp point forward.  I think he would bea consistent DPOY candidate and have a great career as a better version of Clint Capela.
"Maybe add Harden, PJ Tucker, Clint Capela, hold on to Eric Gordon, maybe bring in Melo and Dwight Howard for the bench and you'd have a pretty good team right there."
I remember there was a game where Capela was one rebound short of a 20-20 game and CP was one rebound short of a Triple-Double. The last missed shot went to both of them. I remember think Clint got the board but CP was credited with it
Giannis is just Clint Capela with handles at this point
"It's not as rigid as it used to be, but you're correct ""positionless"" is kind of overblown, what PJ Tucker is doing is completely different than what Clint Capela is doing."
Any site that explains the consequences of a hyperextended knee? He had a 240lb Clint Capela fall back into him while he foot was already planted causing the hyperextension. He should have ligament damage under normal circumstances. Go watch Dr. Sutterer or something.
"Sorry, that's just a terminology difference then.  I use Roleplayer to describe someone who fulfills a role on a team, I would describe people like Joe Harris, PJ Tucker, Clint Capela, etc... as Roleplayers.  Yes Lopez is an important player for the bucks, but at best he's their 4th best player, and his role on the team is focused.  Going from being a top 2 player on a team, and posting large stats regularly with a bad record, to a smaller role with more focused responsibilities, on a team that has now made it to the NBA finals imo is the perfect example of an empty stats player.  Players with those stats aren't bad, but they are putting up those stats on usage rates, and with responsibilities that a winning team wouldn't be able to allow them to have."
Clint Capela is insanely overrated.
*2015-2016 rockets*:  Patrick Beverley   Harden  Corey Brewer   Ariza   Dwight Howard  *2016-2017 rockets*:  Harden  Patrick Beverley  Ariza   Ryan Anderson  22 year old Clint Capela   Both of those teams are worse than the current Mavericks.
Clint Capela was arguably the second best player on the Hawks. He is insanely underrated imo. Elite rebounder and a very good inside defender. He’s also a good lob threat and screener. If he were a free agent he could definitely fetch 4 years/100 million.
"Hm idk, major player is vague and I definitely not mean an MVP caliber player, though I do think Hayes could be an all-star one day if he puts it all together. I mean not the worst playing in the starting lineup of a contender. Someone who starts and contributes to a top 8 team in the league.  Take Clint Capela then add a 3 point shot and 20-25% from the free throw line. That's what I hope to see Hayes become."
"What do you mean by 'major player'? His ceiling looks like Clint Capela, not an allstar or MVP caliber of player"
The biggest issue is his height. He’s awesome in the body and a better finisher than Capela but Clint is one of the best—if not THE BEST—rebounder(s) in the league.
Even if the hawks had won this series you could add Clint Capela to that list too
"Clint Capela is a better post defender than Okongwu, Brook wouldnt have been as good as game 5"
Clint Capela fwoh three!
What happened to clint capela?
"Tyler Ulis, DJ Augustin, Michael Redd, Clint Capela, and David Stern"
"Clint ""ben simmons"" capela"
Clint Capela needs to step up. He’s been so disappointing since the Sixers series
"You don’t do anything that much different and just have to hope he misses a lot more shots in G6 than he did in G5. If Brook Lopez beats you by going 14-18, then you live with it. Clint Capela was a legit ~top 5 DPOY candidate this year so tell him to play better. The other thing you can do on offense is try to drive it at him and get him into foul trouble."
He could play more 'careful' and more like Clint Capela on steroids. Dude is 7 ft after all and still probably good defensively despite hobbled.
"This isn't a ""big market"" thing its a ""disproportionate injury"" thing.  &amp;#x200B;  2019 was huge even when KD was out because there were familiar faces in Kawhi/Steph still playing. The WCF was bad because like... and I say this as someone who watched and enjoyed the games, the casual fans don't wanna watch a Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard. Sometimes its not about the teams location its about who you beat. If the Clips were healthy even if the suns won I don't think the WCF would have low vierership.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm gonna watch because I like watching basketball but whose really stoked to see Brook Lopez vs Clint Capela to decide whose gonna go to the NBA finals?"

"OO has been great, especially during these playoffs. After being injured to start the year, playing behind clint capela, and having a coach for half the year who played him behind bruno Fernando for some reason, he's finally been giving a chance and has shown great promise."
"Everyone is pretty much saying Dwight and I agree.  I just want to add something in light of the effectiveness of small ball this playoffs and recognising that a lot of people on here probably didn't see prime Dwight.   Small ball only works when the bigs cannot punish the smaller players guarding them. It's why Rudy was so ineffective against the Clippers, and why Ayton has been dominating. The former cannot punish smaller guys, and the latter can.  I just want it known that when people say Dwight had no post-moves they don't mean he couldn't score in the post. Yes, it wasn't fancy but he was still more skilled in the post than most big men today. This man dominated inside. If he got deep position it was over. If he got a smaller guy on him it was over. It bothers me that a lot of newer fans seem to think he played like Clint Capela or DeAndre Jordan.   He probably should have played more PnR in his prime (blame Shaq for that one), but he was much better in the post before back surgery as well."

Is Clint capela a ghost or what
Typical Clint Capela having 0 impact on the game
Why don't teams just hack Clint Capela? Seriously.
Clint “Tree Rollins” Capela
They did a player profile interview with clint capela… star power is off the charts for this series
"Off ball movement works against anyone. Clint capela has scored many points being an off ball rim runner. Especially with a player like harden. He could shoot, screen, pass, and score in the paint. Back door cuts would have been helpful when someone like Chris was running the offense. The most off ball stuff harden would do would be a to set a screen to get a weaker defender switched onto him. This idea that Chris got more explosive as he got 2 years older is stupid."
Wtf is Clint Capela on this list ?? Who cares about some role player? And fuck cp3 he ain’t winning shit
"Philadelphia's win percentage the last four seasons:  63%, 62%, 59% and 68%.  Across those four seasons Embiid missed a combined 80 games in the regular season.  Are you seriously suggesting that Philadelphia would have won more games if we'd replaced Embiid with a very good centre?  That having full seasons of say Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela or Nikola Vucevic will make Philadelphia a consistent 58+ win team?  If so, let's trade him now!  But I think, instead, it's showing that ABILITY IS THE BEST ABILITY."
"Yes ofc its Gianniss fault he went up for a shot and fucking Clint Capela landed right on top of him and hyperextended his leg. Nah Giannis just needs to get stronger. Stop with the ""Best ability is availability"" bullshit, it's just luck."
I don't want to start rumors but I heard clint capela did the same thing but 10 times In a row.
Suns need to get the starters out before they have a Clint Capela situation
We’re gonna get a Jae crowder vs Clint capela finals
I'd like to see Clint Capela do that!
"Hawks don’t have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De’Andre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
"The wording makes it sound like they're questioning if Trae Young **is** Clint Capela. There's like a foot difference in height, how do you mix those 2 up?"
"The Chinese names are the best. In China, they call an  alley oop “making pancakes” so Clint Capela is “Pancake Emperor”"
I probably won’t.   If you find Khris Middleton vs Clint Capela appealing to watch then be my guest.

"Clint unlocked a fifth gear in his game after that over the backboard jumper and the basketball gods decided to nerf him the rest of the game. Don’t worry, he’ll be back game 5 and bud won’t know how to game plan around a shooting Capela"
I don't want to believe Clint Capela is a dirty player but the way he planted in Giannis landing position was a dangerous play.
"I don't want to say that this year's title is going to have an asterisk, but...  When a team wins Game 4 of the ECF with its top four scorers being the corpse of Lou Williams, a Bogdanovic, Huerter, and Clint Capela, you can't help but think it."
"Lmk when Clint Capela, John Collins, or Kevin Huerter hit back to back deep pull-up threes late in the 4th quarter of an elimination game pal..."

CLINT “AOMINE DAIKI” CAPELA
"Clint ""Aomine Daiki"" Capela"
"So trae is SLANDERED on his defense, it really has improved from last year but you will never hear it mentioned. He gets steals, and even doubles centers well (see embiid a few times). he also hawks passing lanes to make up for lack of size. BUT despite all this, the hawks scheme a defense entirely around trae in making sure he’s hidden in the corner guarding the “pj tuckers” of the world so he can’t really be taken advantage of. So the lack of having to scheme trae into the defense empowers the other hawk defenders to play a simplified man defense where some of them really shine, see Kevin huerter, cam reddish, Clint capela, and deandre hunter (when he gets a new knee). This obviously helps the hawks defend especially against star players like giannis. The clippers part is just stupid and doesn’t even dignify a response. Sorry bro"
The only one who can beat Clint Capela...  ... Is Clint Capela.
If you told me someone on the hawks hit a shot like this Clint Capela would have been my last guess

Sry I've been in a coma until the last 5 minutes. Is Clint Capela the best basketball player ever?
"Of all people to make this shot, it’s Clint Capela lol"
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
Okongwu has had pretty good stats and shown lots of potential for how many minutes he got. He didn’t get much playing time tho due to Clint capela playing 30 minutes. I think he will be a solid nba player with the right development. This is if he recovers from the injury properly. Really hope he does.
"Especially as a rockets fan. Rockets have had awful picks for like 10 years until this year, which is still too early to tell.  Best picks since the 2010 draft (in no particular order): Clint Capela, Marcus Morris, Chandler Parsons, and Montrezl Harrell.  Granted they haven’t had a ton of 1sts but still."

"Tangential since you mentioned it, but who are the top five shotblockers in the league currently?    Myles Turner   Mitchell Robinson   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Anthony Davis   Rudy Gobert   Joel Embiid   Clint Capela   Robert Williams   Deandre Ayton   Bam Adebayo"
"Rim running, rebounding, and esp shot blocking. Also a solid passer. He’s basically Clint capela. He can jump out of the gym but has been unable to stay healthy so far."
"Very.  Based on current performance, it's a slight overpay.  But, his arrow is pointing waaaay up developmentally.  He has the potential to be a force defensively, and he's an excellent lob threat and decent passer who might develop a more solid all-around offensive game.   Clint Capela is who I've often looked at as his ceiling, but he might be better defensively.  So, I could easily see this contact looking great by years 3 and 4.  And, there's a decent chance he could break out this year and have cost way more if we waited."
"He probably can be a plus player, as in better than replacement level, the problem is he’s getting paid like he’s Clint Capela with a jumper"
Anyone think Clint Capela will get defensive player of the year next season?
KAT needs to surpass Clint Capela before he's in the conversation with Booker or Jokic.
"I don't know why but every time I see the words CC, I think of Ali Siddiq's Prison Riot - Mexican got on Boots. But I agree, Clint Capela is a beast on 2K. Dude is a rebounding machine lol."
"solid answer, and I'd argue he could potentially get even more than 20/20 in the NCAA, he's by no means an elite center but he's slept on right now I think.     That said, on a 16-seed, would he be able to create enough offense for himself to actually be that effective? A 16-seed's PG is going to struggle against stronger teams' defenses, even if Clint Capela is on the receiving end of most of the passes."
"Cant be a shooter, they can go cold sometimes and could reault in a early loss. I'd say somebody that either lives in the paint or a really good playmaker. Maybe a Clint Capela? 15ppg and 14 rpg in the NBA but I would bet both of those shoot up to the twenties against smaller ncaa opponents. Not to mention that Capela is super well conditionee so he could easily play 36 minutes of the 40 total"
Clint Capela- shot blocking
Clint capela sees Kevon looney in his nightmares.
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
"We had one shot creator on our team in James Harden. The rest of the guys are spot-up shooters with little to no shot creation ability. What exactly do you want the Rockets to do at that point? Sure, we could try and run a Trevor Ariza high PnR or go to a Clint Capela post-up, but that's obviously not going to end well. Our team was specifically built to play one way, and that was through Chris Paul/James Harden isolations that led to baskets for those two or kick-outs for open 3s. If you have an issue with the roster construction not providing room to adapt, then that's fair, but you can't make a trade for another shot creator during the middle of a game 7. We didn't have the ability to revamp our offense on the fly so sticking to our guns was the best option we had at winning that game.  We also shot 44 3s which was in-line with our season and playoff averages. It's not like we chucked up 60+ threes and completely ignored attacking the basket. We ran our normal offense and just didn't hit the 3s we took. At the end of the day, we lost by 9. If we only have a horrific percentage from 3 (4/27) instead of a completely catastrophic percentage (0/27) then we win that game."
Are you serious or trolling?   Capela is 27 and Wiseman is 19. James is 100x better than Clint was at 19.
Yeah and Clint Capela &gt; Shaq
**G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** SGA  **F:** Jerami Grant  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Clint Capela
I hate Ben and capela that spacing would be 🤮. Id rather just wait for a different star that actually fits to come available then offer up that for Ben i think bens great with the right fit but that fit isn’t beside Clint.
"It’s not really a problem when it’s your center, especially if they also create a bunch of space via screens and have roll gravity. It’s also just a weird thing people have with Rudy. I don’t think I’ve seen someone say Clint Capela is holding back the hawks offensively (or the rockets before that) and offensively Gobert is basically a significantly more efficient version of Capela."
"Current Dwight is like budget Clint Capela, which is great for the money. Maybe in regards to modern big, OP meant someone who can set hard screens and picks, while being surrounded by 4 shooters. Basically Orlando Dwight."
"Yeah if you take away the Harden trade all he did was get Chris Paul, Clint Capela, and 3&amp;D wings. In conclusion, if you adjust Morey to the level of an average GM, he’s an average GM 😀"
"It was actually 80 million and here’s a list of players making the same or more than him next season.  Bojan Bogdanovic, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Gallinari, Gary Harris, Tim Hardaway, Buddy Hield  It’s honestly hilarious how Pelicans fans think losing a 38% 3PT shooter on high volume that plays borderline elite defense and has great synergy with Zion is a good thing…  That defense is going to be godawful this season.  Who’s your best defender? Hart? JV? Lmfao"
"did you just unironically say you'd take clint capela over KAT?  you're aware that even just a year or two ago, devin booker, who just made the finals this year, was accused of the exact same shit as you said about KAT?   sometimes it's not the players fault, but rather their coaching &amp; situations, you can't just see everything as black or white"
"Not only no but hell no. I think KAT is a likable guy, but he's allergic to winning basketball. I'd blame it on the city of Minnesota being cursed, but Jimmy Butler dragged them to the playoffs. Without Jimmy Butler, KAT has not only been kept out of the playoffs, the closest the Wolves have gotten is still a full 10 wins behind 8th place.  I don't want that curse anywhere near my team. If I have to pick a center for a max contract, I wouldn't just pick Embiid and Jokic first, I'd pick Gobert, I'd pick Adebayo, I'd pick Ayton, and I'd legit pick Clint Capela over KAT if my goal is to win games.  There's the hot take people were looking for. KAT is definitely one of the most talented centers in the league, but I legitimately believe Clint Capela, an excellent starter who's nowhere near All-Star level, would be more of a contributor to a winning team.

I'll play along because I too am bored.

"Malcolm Brogdon Luka Doncic Mikael Bridges Tobias Harris  Clint Capela  No all stars, but a really good team imo"
Most underrated - SGA/Clint Capela Most overrated - Probably Jordan Clarkson.
"No way, just look Clint Capela, he's not second unità guy, and Ben Is an even better defender with more mobility, imagine replace Clint with Ben in 2018 Houston"
Clint Capela
"As a Rockets fan I'd say any combination of 1990 x 2010. Imagine the 2017 Rockets, but instead of Clint Capela, you have the one of the greatest post players and defender's of all time. Chris Paul/Hakeem pnr would literally be unstoppably by any player outside of like Wilt, and you also have James Harden, who can also be an exceptional playmaker and the primary scoring option. You'd have to double-team Harden at the perimeter, and damn near triple-team Hakeem at the interior, which would let them kick out to shooters like Kenny Smith, who shot 43.8% his best year in Houston. On top of that, you'd have (slightly washed) Clyde Drexler, who averaged 22 and 36 3p%. Basically everyone in this lineup is an ELITE shooter except Hakeem, who can completely carry the defensive load on the interior. Drexler is also an elite defender, and Harden can do a serviceable job when pushed."
clint capela
"Uh, yeah if you’re Clint Capela or DeAndre Jordan. Zion makes all his own shots at the rim by himself. This is like saying Shaq and Giannis’ TS isn’t impressive."
Clint Capela. For some reason he’s never mentioned as a top tier center. He’s really good and was arguably the Hawks second best player
Top 100 is just boring in the NBA. I don't really care where Clint Capela falls versus Jusuf Nurkic.   Top 25 is juicy.
Clint Capela was the most impactful player on the Hawks last season from an impact stats standpoint. He was a legit shout for 2 team all defense.

So Ja &amp; Mike Conley are all 1 TIER AHEAD OF FOX while Clint Capela is in the same tier as Fox? 🤦🏽‍♂️
clint capela and al horford above Sabonis is fight worthy
He did this even early in his career before Sabonis became a starter and they played a lot   He doesn’t have many functional offensive skills him in the paint doesn’t do much. He’s become a solid roll man but he’s not a Clint capela Rudy Gobert level type for sure. Can’t rebound. No ability to attack switches. No shot creation or face up game. Zero playmaking. He’s a negative offensive player regardless of role  He is a floor spacer by choice because relative to other 5s he has more skill as a shooter. That doesn’t mean he actually provides any real floor spacing though it’s just the nature of the position the stretch 5 outside of a few cases is all fake
Clint Capela smiling down from heaven
"In regards to no. 7, I agree with the first part but I can’t bring myself to blame Rudy on the second. He has a similar skill set to a Clint Capela who performed fine in the playoffs. He’s a lob threat who can punish switches, he is just never given the ball. He is always better with Conley, that’s down to Conley actually finding him when he can score."
"Skillwise, I think he is a tier lower than that. He was good, but I think CP3 made him look way better than he was. Also his decline was tied to his athleticism, so after the Lob City Clips, he pretty much did nothing.  His offense was rolling to the rim for the lob and offensive rebounds. He couldn't shoot the mid range less the 3 so he needed to be fed.  His defense was good but not great, really good at being the secondary defender and blocking shots, but he wasn't a one on one stopper.   I would compare him to Clint Capela now."
Clint Capela?
"Yeah it’ll ruin his signature look, “Clint Capela from really far away”."
How? Every time I see it i think of Clint capela
Enes Kanter and Clint Capela
He was like Clint Capela in an era with less 3pt emphasis and when the centre position wasn't so situational. So pretty good

Clint Capela is an evolved form of Shrouder
Fuckin Clint Capela on a MLE to back up Embiid type shit lol
Yeah you’ll even see the guys like Dwight Howard and Clint capela raining down 3s no problem
&gt;none of his teammates deserve blame.  Clint Capela: 3-11  Eric Gordon: 2-9  Ryan Anderson: 0-6  Lou Williams: 3-7  Sam Dekker: 2-6
"Ignore the other posts they're vastly underrating those guys to hype Dirk up as if what he did isn't impressive without embellishing.   Kidd = Conley/Lowry type vet PG  Terry = Clarkson if he was a legit passer/rich man's Delon Wright  Marion = Mikal Bridges level defense, similar offensive value even though their games are different  Tyson = Clint Capela but DPOY level, or middle class Gobert  Dallas had a strong ass roster, people just expected them to choke."
.... Are y'all all serious? Clint Capela is the most obvious comp. Maybe Gobert but a worse shot blocker (still good enough to be DPOY though).
Saddiq dyed his hair Clint Capela style and got a lot bigger.
He averaged like 17 or 18 as a rookie. If Skill-less guys like Clint Capela have a place in the NBA then at worst Okafor could be a rim running big that catches lobs
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good.

Miles Bridges over Clint Capela is the greatest dunk in nba history.
"He was really good offensively. He just played no defense at all.  That was the year people finally realized Clint Capela was a defensive monster, so it was a really steep drop off when Faried was on the floor for him."
Clint Capela?
Hawks the deepest imo  Trae Young  Lou Williams  Kevin Huerter  Bogdan Bogdonavich  Cam Reddish  DeAndre Hunter  Sharife Cooper  Danilo Gallinari  Jalen Johnson  John Collins  Onyeka Okongwu  Clint Capela
Is this Clint capela?
"They are different, Zaza had a track record for it, had full vision, and closed in to do it. Giannis was just going for a rebound and beat Kyrie to the spot, they both noticed too late, and Kyrie got hurt. Being salty about it nonstop doesn't do anything for anyone. It would be like me constantly bitching about Clint Capela turning Giannis' knee backwards, despite it being obviously an accident."
Shai Gilgeous Alexander / Jamal Murray / Jerami Grant / Michael Porter Jr / Clint Capela
Lonzo Ball - Jamal Murray - Jerami Grant - John Collins - Clint Capela.
Yes he was smh. I can tell you didn’t watch the series. Clint Capela was shaded toward him every time he got the ball because the Hawks gave no fucks about Taj or Nerlans Noel. Julius was basically forced to take contested jumpers the whole series.
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
"I don’t think the point changes: Clint Capela with his offense right now can’t really be put in a contender that asks him to do a lot offensively, whether or not if that’s with the Hawks.  It’s not that long ago that his offense completely disappeared when Kevon Looney was guarding him.  Plus y’all have 2 more years left on his contract."
"I’m high on James Wiseman because he’s a 19-year old who had to play more than 10 times the number of games he played in high school in his first year as a starting center for a playoff team with Steph. I won’t deny that it was a tad disappointing year for him but a top 3 pick has never been asked to contribute so immediately in the last decade or so other than Tatum and that’s largely because Hayward’s first season as a Celtic didn’t last 10 minutes. I think he’s shown a lot of promise especially right before his second injury so I’m pretty high on him for now. Not saying he’s gonna be All-NBA or an elite starting center in year 2 but he’s gonna be better than what most people make out to be. He already seems to have bulked up and he’s gonna be having training camp now.  I’m low on Clint Capela particularly because his offense is just so limited. We’ve seen that when he played against the Warriors and more clever teams that try to take away his post ups and force him to be a decision maker while also hacking him. People don’t realize it but Capela hasn’t cracked 50% from the free throw line since 2016-17 and that’s not likely to change, meaning a Hack-a-Capela is more than possible, except teams don’t really try it. Once the Hawks get stuffed with cap space by virtue of paying out their young core Capela is gonna be asked to do a lot more, and I don’t think that’s necessarily gonna change. He’s only 26 so there’s room for inprovement, but he hasn’t developed a whole lot offensively."
"There was a ridiculous ""rumor"" by some guy on Nets Twitter that said Marks was trying to somehow get Clint Capela or Myles Turner as part of this. Like it wasn't from any sort of reporter or even blogger, just some fan.   Certain people let themselves believe it and get overhyped for some reason."
You are trying to move the goalposts now and say they have to fit your specific criteria before it meets it. I don't need to because I'm not trying to fit your specific criteria. I don't care about it.   Players have been critical of their teammates forever. So have coaches. From Shaq and Kobe to Jordan and every one of his teammates that he's bullied and chastised. There's a reason why we know about Phil Jackson calling out Kobe and telling him to grow up. There's a reason why the story is out there that Jordan punched Kerr. Whether it's direct or indirect its all the same. They put it out there to send a message to the player to step their game up.  This article also clearly states that Clint Capela and John Collins talked down on Trae's game. Collins confirmed it and then just said that no matter what they're brothers. I'm thinking Collins and his agent put it out there to The Athletic because of how they intro'd him but you can believe what you want. You just sound really young and haven't watched a lot of NBA to see that this is normal.
Clint capela
Yeah the way some people talk about KD on the Warriors you'd think he's Clint Capela or someone who literally only scores if you give him wide open layups
"Nets Hawks Bucks 76ers Heat Bulls    That’s how I rank the top 6 in the east.  It is my opinion that if the Hawks were as healthy as the Bucks or Suns and had Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter in the line up at the same time they would be champs.  Here’s my thinking:   - The Hawks were statistically a top 10 defense in the regular season while Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter, and and Clint Capela were all healthy.  Then injuries happened.   - The Hawks young core was underdeveloped under a terrible coach (LP) and did not have any continuity with 1 covid shortened season and no bubble as well as no offseason program and really no pre season.   -  As soon as a good coach came to the organization the Hawks had the best record in the East from March-July as well as the best 4th quarter point differential in the East.  This all happened while facing one of the toughest second half schedules in the league and without their starting 5 starting a game together until round 1 of the playoffs.  They were I believe the 3rd most injured team during the regular season.  - With an almost full off season and pre season with a good coach, as well as the progress that you would expect hard working players under 25 to make, 3/4ths of Atlanta’s team could theoretically play better than they did last season.  I’m a Hawks fan so call me a homer if you will, but we’re in the golden age of Atlanta Hawks basketball and I’m expecting the best stretch our franchise has ever had over the next 5-10 years.  Last year was already the best team in our history and our core is all under 25."
"He’s about to show up in Atlanta on stilts, claiming to be Clint Capela."
"He got way better on the defensive end and had to adapt to a new role on offense to accommodate clint capela, moving his shot selection away from the rim and more into the midrange. he did a great job remaining productive on significantly fewer touches and more limited opportunities"
"The Hawks statistically had a top 10 defense before Cam and Deandre were injured last year.  If the Hawks are able to consistently roll out line ups with Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter and Clint Capela in the line up together they will be top 10 offensively and defensively."
"If we’re going just based off of skill, I’d say a good start to Bill Russell’s comparisons to more modern bigs would be anywhere from Clint Capela to prime KG (id prob take prime KG but that’s the end range where if someone off the bat tried to tell me he’d 100% be better than prime KG I’d be hesitant that we’d be having a rational conversation.   That’s a big gap but either way Bil Russell would be a good starting caliber player in any era imo. There’s enough game footage imo to begin to have a rational discussion about how he’d stack up even if there were some different rules and no 3 point line. And you can definitely toss in the x-factors of his clutchness, which trend with his accolades without automatically just saying “he’s gotta be top 10 he has 11 chips”."
I like Moses Brown. Dude could be Luka's Clint Capela.
"At this point, Jarrett Allen had a better age 22 season than Clint Capela and furthermore, Allen shows signs of potentially being a stretch 5, which would make him infinitely more valuable than Clint Capela.  I'd rather have a 23 year old Jarrett Allen on 5/100 than 26 year old Clint Capela on 5/90."
Clint Capela 17 mill is Robbery..
20 million a year for a young center like that isn’t crazy. Hes basically a young Clint capela
"Since when is locking up a player on a contract that's at his value currently longer bad?  Clint Capela after his 4th year signed his 5/90 deal and he was playing similarly to Allen.  With cap increases etc and the projections for Allen's improvement you would think it'd be better long term, unless of course Allen doesn't improve or regresses.  Not to mention Allen will only be 28 when this contract ends."
The Hawks are better. Would you trade Clint Capela for Maxi Kleber? Dorian Finney-Smith for Danilo Gallinari? Tim Hardaway Jr. for Bogdan Bogdanovich?
"Lol. I swear people didn't even watch the playoffs and just pretend to watch basketball. Ayton choked a couple games (yes, important games) but had a fantastic run for the most part on both sides of the floor.     People here are saying he can't shoot at all. That's just patently false. In the regular season he shot 48% overall from 10-16 ft. In the playoffs, he shot 61% from 10-16 ft overall.  He has a way better touch than Clint Capela. For reference, Capela shot 25% from 10-16 ft and in the playoffs he literally didn't even attempt from that distance."
"He’s a much better Clint Capela (who’s being paid $17m a year) that’s 22 years old and put up 16/11 on 66% shooting.   If you’re not giving him the max, at least 10 other teams can and will."
Ayton is a classic great defensive center who can't lives off of lobs and drop offs. Doesn't create his own shot or shoot 3s or playmake. He's a better version of Clint Capela in that regard. Only difference is Ayton is pretty good at switching.
Absolutely.   &gt; the skillset of a Clint Capela type of player  lol what
"According to RAPTOR overall ratings, Clint Capela was seven positions higher than James Harden, LeBron James, and Kris Middleton.   Clint is a great player. But he is in no way a top ten player."
"Homie, that stat has Clint Capela in the top ten.   Hold off on your judgement until we see the product on the floor. Basketball is played with ten people and one ball. Not whatever the fuck RAPTOR is."
Yes  They’d be monstrous with a guy in the Clint Capela mould
"Clint Capela, James Harden"
"With the exception of LeBron, all the other stars who you say have had memorable performances have other great complementary players who make up for their deficiencies.  &gt; . Can’t say the same for Harden, the only post season where his numbers got better was the 2020 playoffs.   Just because you don't remember the games don't mean they didn't happen.   - 2015: 45 against the warriors in the wcf against four HOFers. All harden had was Dwight.  -2017: closes out MVP Russ in 5 games with Clint Capela as his second best player   -2018: dropped 44 against the wolves when Chris Paul shot 5-14   - 2019: 41 in an overtime win against KD, Steph, Klay, draymond, and iggy (literally 5 HOFers) with a clearly worse version of CP3 than in the 2017-2018 year.   I literally remember all of these. I honestly don't remember a ""memorable"" steph moment from the playoffs other than his turnover in 2016 in the finals. Kd had his first memorable playoff moment this year when he dropped 50 against the Bucks. Kawhi's buzzer beater obviously is his signature moment."
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"
"&gt; So I guess instead of using the same season you decided to cherry pick your stats. No surprise there.  I literally just used the numbers for everyone the year before they joined the Hawks. That's all I did. The intention wasn't to cherry pick.   &gt; And the not comparing minutes was in regards to your assessment of the Hawks players.  Ok, well that's a different argument. You were very vague on what you were saying because you initially brought up Kemba's minutes and I was mostly referring to the quality of his minutes vs. the quantity of his minutes. Next time you want someone to know what you are talking about try not to just say ""no minutes lol"". I'm fine discussing the minutes.   &gt; Kemba in the other hand is entirely different. Minimal injury that took him out, he had a more significant one this season  This just isn't true. That injury in the playoffs took him out for half of this season. It wasn't minimal, but he played through it. It's weird that you don't think it counts that he has an injury just because he's playing. That happens all the time.  &gt; You literally said 5 guys were better without Trae and then backed that to 4 where you cherry picked stats to back up your argument.  Again, I literally just used their numbers before the year before they joined the Hawks. The Hawks had 7+ guys who could average 15ppg and that's not all because of Trae, like you suggested. Lou Will could do that without Trae. Clint Capela could do that without Trae. Bogdanovic could do that without Trae. Gallo could do that without Trae. That's what I was attempting to say. Collins could do that without Trae too i would guess. Same with Hunter imo.   The stats weren't meant to be cherry picked. I used the same criteria for all of them: ppg year before joining the Hawks.  &gt; So the argument you were making was actually non-sensical and you didn’t have the ability to back it up.  This is a much better thing to say."
"&gt; Who are 5 guys that were putting up better stats without Trae?  That was an exaggeration, but at least 4 of them played equivalent or better in years without Trae. And the rest of the have never played without Trae, so there's no way of knowing.  1. Gallinari: 18ppg in OKC then 13 ppg in ATL  2. Lou Williams: 18ppg in LAC then 10ppg in ATL  3. Bogdan Bogdanovic: 15ppg in SAC then 16ppg in ATL  4. Clint Capela: 16ppg in HOU then 15ppg in ATL  &gt; Hayward played 4/6 games  He averaged 10ppg and wasn't around for the rest of the playoffs to get to that point. Hardly, anything helpful to the team.   &gt; So you are literally pretending Lou Williams was a better player than Kemba Walker.  Wtf?!?!? That's a reach on what I was saying. I said the best players were injured and Kemba was certainly injured and his per 36 numbers certainly show that. Doesn't matter how man minutes he played.  &gt; Yeah your not doing Celtics flairs any favours  Lol wtf does this even mean?"
Russell Westbrook getting the rebound and initiating the fast break is far more valuable than Steven Adams/ Clint Capela/ Robin Lopez.
Jrue Holiday was instrumental in completely locking down Damian Lilliard. Clint Capela alongside CP3 cost HOU the series against GS in 2019
"Yeah it wasn’t if all you know is what the stat sheet tells you. Robinson, SJax, Bowen, Malik Rose and Ginobili were all above average to great defensive players and Parker, Ginobili, and SJax were good enough on offense to match their counterparts in the playoffs.   The Wolves were worse offensively and defensively on paper, the Lakers were imploding and the Mavs were an all offense team that couldn’t match their physicality and defense. The Nets second leading scorer was KMart who was essentially an early Clint Capela and they had a young Jefferson who couldn’t dribble and Kerry Kittles who was about as good as Tony Parker."
"Stopped looking like 10 guys in...Jamal Murray, and Clint Capela impact winning waaayyy more than Siakam and VanVleet who are rated higher. List is trash."
"&gt;Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are great players, no one is denying that, but Brown is coming off of injuries and I don't think he is going to be any better than last season, more of the same with probably a slower start to the season  Brown's injury wasn't major and he got surgery early so that he would be ready for this upcoming season. You're making a bigger deal of his injury than it really is. And Brown has made massive leaps every year (outside of 2019 for obvious reasons, that whole team was a mess).  Jaylen Brown PPG/FG% from his rookie year until now:  2016/17: 6.6/45%  2017/2018: 14.5/47%  2018/2019 (outlier for obvious reasons): 13.0/47%  2019/2020: 20.3/47%  2020-2021: 24.7/48% (both career highs)  It's clear he's made massive leaps basically every year and is still young, it's more likely he takes a leap since he isn't even in his prime yet...He's going to be a much better player this year than he was last year  &gt; I'm not as high on Tatum as most everyone else is, he is a fantastic player, but I don't see him as one of the next faces of the league.  You're underrating Tatum. Not much to say here, but get prepared to eat your words lol. He's 23 and already a top 12 player. This year he's going to be top 10. Keep sleeping on him though  &gt;Marcus smart is fantastic, but I don't necessarily like having him be the guy having to run the offense much at all, but regardless he is still elite defensively and has proven he can shoot to a certain degree in this league  Both Tatum/Brown's numbers were much better with only Smart on the court and not Kemba (they both scored more and on higher %'s) last year. Smart becoming the full time PG is a good thing. He is a mix bag I'll give you that, but Smart is a good player overall because of everything he brings like you said (defense and is a streaky shooter)  &gt;Dennis Schroder is the antithesis of Marcus Smart. He is going to be a negative on defense, but bring in a scoring touch off the bench, but if he shares the floor with the two star forwards, I see him taking opportunities away from them.  Schroder isn't a negative on defense overall. I do agree his defense is overhyped, but to say he is a negative is a little overkill. Guys like IT, Kemba, Trae are negatives on defense, not Schroder. And he's not taking shots away from the Jays lmao, we need MORE good players who can get baskets and create for themselves. I don't think you have ever watched the Celtics lol. Kemba is gone which means we need another scorer who can give us between 15-20 PPG like Kemba did, and Schroder can do that. Schroder off the bench is a major weapon for the Celtics, he's super underrated just because he had a few bad playoff games with an injured Lakers team.  &gt;I just don't like his fit necessarily with this roster.  Again, you don't really follow/know the Celtics lol. We fixed a lot of our issues this offseason. We have a better big man rotation (Horford/Williams/Kanter&gt;&gt;&gt;Theis/Williams/Kornet) which allows us a lot of versatility now because of Horford. With Horford we can start him at the 5 (Smart/Richardson (or Nesmith)/Brown/Tatum/Horford is a lineup that can switch everything on defense and play 5 out offensively. We also have Williams who has a lot of potential and is starting to put it together. He gives us a massive shot-blocking/lob presence on defense/offense. We also have a stronger bench with Schroder as the 6th man and Williams (or Horford) off the bench. We have a bunch of 2nd year players with promise as well (I personally think Nesmith is going to be a key role player for us this year, and maybe Pritchard as well)  &gt;I see potential with Josh Richardson, but I'm not sure if that potential is going to come to fruition with this team nd the role that will be asked of him.  For once, I agree with you. I have no idea how the JR experiment will go  &gt;I am not a believer in Robert Williams either. It feels like he has barely played and the Boston fans are already saying he is a top tier center in the making. I personally don't see anything more than a lower end starting caliber center from him  Once again, you're underrating him lol. Injuries are 100% a real concern with him no question, but his talent/impact is there when he is healthy. He has a Clint Capela career type, and that is not low end lol. He had 9 blocks in a single game in the playoffs last year, he's special  &gt;Horford is a imo going to just be decent for short stretches, the guy is getting old.  He's still good, go watch him in OKC. They shut him down because they didn't want to win games...  I'll come back to this comment once the regular season ends don't worry!"
How many people would say Clint Capela should have been in consideration for all star. No one? Elite interior defense is underrated.
"Steph Curry, Giannis, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Clint Capela, OG Anunoby, DeAaron Fox, DeAndre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Jamal Murray, John Collins      1) Dray brings up the ball, scans for best play   2) Spams Steph + Giannis PnR, because that is literally the best hypothetical play in the NBA   3) Giannis dunk, or Steph 3   4) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), kick out to Klay/OG/MPJ/Murray for either an open 3 or a cut to the basket, as Steph, Giannis and especially Draymond are all capable passers.   5) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), Clint Capela or DeAndre Ayton gets the offensive rebound and dunks it.   6) If half-court sets are broken up by the other team, Fox and Collins go fast, score in transition like brrrrrrrrrrr"
"But the Hawks have Clint Capela,De’Andre Hunter, and John Collins. Also we know that Butler can be absolutely terrible, we saw that against the Bucks"
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Alex Caruso  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Joel Embiid  Bench  LaMelo Ball / Jamal Murray / Austin Rivers / Lu Dort / Jae Crowder / Robert Covington / Clint Capela  I legitimately think this team can go 82-0 if injuries are not a factor.
"&gt;g league rejects  Such as CP3 (a top-5 all time pg), Clint Capela (PER of 23.8 - a limited but still useful stat), PJ Tucker (who was literally a starter on the Bucks team that you claim was stacked in 2021) and Eric Gordon.   Bro clearly you're delusional. That's not all-time talent but it's certainly not a bad roster and it's not far off the bucks who had: Middleton, Bledsoe, Brogdon, and Lopez.  Harden didn't carry alone - CP3 was huge for that team"
"Pg: Chris Paul (all-star)  Sg: CJ McCollum  Sf: Paul George (all-star)  Pf: Kevin Durant (superstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  Bench: Ja Morant, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, Mikal Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Clint Capela,"
Assuming everyone is healthy all 82 games like the post mentioned  PG: Jrue Holiday SG: Bradley Beal (all star) SF: Paul George (all star) PF: Kevin Durant (superstar) C: Joel Embiid (superstar)   Bench PG: Jamal Murray SG: Malcolm Brogdon SF: OG Anunoby PF: Christian Wood C: Clint Capela
"Chris Paul, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Clint Capela.  Plus defenders in every role, 4 3-level scorers.  Everybody can pass and shoot outside the best role player C in Capela."
PG: Curry/Fox/Ja  SG: Shai/Bridges  SF: Paul George/MPJ  PF: Giannis/Collins  C: Karl Anthony Towns/Christian Wood/Clint Capela  Superstars: Curry and Giannis  All stars: Paul George and KAT  Who's messing with this?

"Jrue Holiday, Bradley Beal, KD, Lebron, Clint Capela….    7 man Bench would be TJ Mcconel, KCP, Jae Crowder, Thaddeus Young, Nerlens Noel, Javale Mcgee and Seth Curry"
Thats like saying Clint Capela outplayed Embiid
"Russ is the only one who seems like the odd man out there, Either Luka or Trae takes a hit from not being on-ball all the time there, but you do have the same Spain pick and roll/ double drag action the Hawks already run with Jayson Tatum instead of John Collins and Joel Embiid instead of Clint Capela which seems like a lethal action that they could run as frequently as they wanted."
Clint Capela now a max player
"Ayton averaged like 15ppg he was scoring as much as Clint Capela last regular season, just not a very impactful offensive player vs average teams."
The hawks are a great young team who have a super promising future but there are levels to this shit.  Young Teams do not win nba championships the first time they reach the playoffs.  The sixers were a dysfunctional hot mess that should have still won their series against the hawks.  But give Atlanta credit for winning that series.  For them to have beaten the bucks and the suns to win a title with their oldest starter being Clint capela. That would have been monumental and unheard of
"Clint Capela, Eric Gordon, Lou Williams, and PJ Tucker fucking suck too      You act like his supporting cast was worse than LeBron’s 1st stint in Cleveland"
It's not possible but Gobert fir Jaylen brown and Clint capela would be insane.
i always associate clint capela with 12/12 for some reason
The only realistic trade would be Clint Capela and a bunch of other assets.
"You can't really compare efficiency between players from almost 20 years apart, and 1 whose supporting cast was Mutombo and McKie vs the other whose supporting cast was Chris Paul, Eric Gordon (playing out of his mind), and Clint Capela."
"Like B Rabbit in 8 Mile, it’s also where he’ll predict whether Hasheem Thabeet or Clint Capela will have a better career."
Clint Capela is up there for sure.  He really transformed that Hawks defense.
LeVert Brogdon and Warren are injured all the time  Clint Capela is a defensive rim running big man. Their market value is never gonna be as high as high end wing defenders  Aaron Gordon is a better player than Duncan Robinson imo  Jae Crowder was the closest player to Aaron Gordon in terms of archetype but also does less than AG on offense and have similar defensive abilities. He was also 30 when he signed his current deal.  I feel like people keep viewing the AG deal in terms of a 109M cap instead of a ~120M cap that it’s gonna be when his deal expires.
"Top 10 maybe? Seems too slow to be a great defender. He doesn’t come across as a great athlete to be a run runner. He doesn’t have a jumpshot. Just seems like a player that doesn’t have much value in today’s game, but his scoring potential puts him above most of the leagues big men.  I’d definitely put Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, KAT, Bam, Ayton, Allen and Horford above him.   He’s probably in the Brook Lopez, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela range."
"Clint Capela, Josh Richardson,"
"&gt;his best teammates being Eric Gordon and Clint Capela  Gordon has declined a lot lately, but he did earn that big contract when he got to the Rockets.  I think Capela gets a bum rap, he was hurt and shipped out so suddenly he's another bum?  I think he just proved his worth over in Atlanta and that his early success with Harden / CP3 wasn't a fluke (well, I might have just jinxed him lol).  Dray and Klay are better of course, but people like to talk as if Harden was playing with literal G-Leaguers the entire time in Houston."
"&gt; Harden however has dragged some underwhelming Rocket teams to high seeds in the western conference with some of his best teammates being Eric Gordon and Clint Capela.  Those were All-Star teams compared to the debris Harden dragged to the playoffs in 2013. The other 4 starters were Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, Omer Asik and Pat Patterson. Their 6th man was Carlos Delfino. Someone named Greg Smith was in the rotation.   None of those guys is as good as Draymond or Wiggins, probably not even Oubre. That's a roster that'd lose 70+ games without Harden. They went 45-37."
"Clint can fill that role as a roll man AND as a rim protecting defender. Faried wasnt actually good in that role, and while he never played with someone as good as Trae at point guard...he did play with a Jokic for a couple years, then with Harden, and couldnt get it to work. Capela is just a better player in todays game."
Is there a reason you didn't mention Draymond or Maple Jordan? 2 guys who are clearly a large step above JTA and the previously mentioned Eric Gordon and Clint Capela?
"Effort and athletecism are not sustainable when age makes the player slower and every year younger  faster players enter the league. There needs to be some elite NBA skill to sustain the career when athletecism starts to slip. Otherwise you just stop being an NBA caliber player.   Fareid is also in the archetype of big that loses value VERY quickly when they lose a step. (Undersized and unable to shoot or create offense). Tristan Thompson and Clint Capela come to mind, though Capela was good this year so we'll see if that was a short-term fluke."
"That is exactly correct, Curry got a lot of criticism this season despite his incredible year because his Warriors team didn’t even make the playoffs despite a bad roster with numerous injuries. Harden however has dragged some underwhelming Rocket teams to high seeds in the western conference with some of his best teammates being Eric Gordon and Clint Capela. Curry however just fits so well with other high end talent and 3 rings speaks for itself, it’s hard to quantify his off ball spacing value that makes his teammates jobs much easier. Harden is all strictly on the ball value."
Yeah we can compare them when Luka is pulling Clint Capela and Eric Gordon to top 3-4 seeds every year in the toughest conference ever.
Thought you just compared MJ to Clint Capela lol
Joel Embiid to the Hawks for Clint Capela it is
"I think in today's game it's more important to have a big that can play on the perimeter offensively rather than a lob threat if said lob threat is a guy like Harrel or Drummond.  A guy like Capela is a different story, but Harrel and Drummond are nowhere near that because Clint is quite a bit better defensively."
"Well, he never made the playoffs. And that one time he did, he got exposed by Clint Capela."
"Against Clint Capela, who is a fantastic defender"
"Wow I forgot he averaged 15ppg in that series, was he hurt?  That's obviously not gonna help his cause when he completely dominated by Clint Capela in a playoff series.  And I love Capela, but Embiid absolutely tossed him around like a ragdoll in the Philly series, it was very apparent that he's not a top tier center (which KAT should be)."
Trae can get to his floater and lob it to giannis. Clint Capela does this and giannis is just better at it. They're a 65-17 team
"Best thread was when someone took the 8 mile rap battle quote ""Fuck ThaBeet, I'd go a Capela"" and said Eminem predicted how Clint Capela would have a better career than Hasheem Thabeet lol  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fjkocd/in_2002_eminem_accurately_predicted_which_among/"
"Sure, last thing I'll say is that the main threat is the fact he's able to both dive to the rim and spot up as well, it's already over for the defense if they play it wrong right there. You saying it like that makes it sound like you don't think people like Clint Capela or Gobert are threats running to the rim.  And if/when the help comes he's already in an advantage position so he just has to hit the weakside corner or dump off for easy bucket, or of course he can finish if he's able to"
&gt;wtf kinda take is this.  Atleast fact check before you say things like this lol.   Stats from PBP:  Trae on:  John Collins: 25.7pts/100 65.1% TS  Clint Capela: 27.5pts/100 62.4% TS  Trae off:  John Collins: 21.8pts/100 51.7% TS  Clint Capela 18.2pts/100 39.4% TS
Idk man. I’ve always thought they could’ve waited and instead taking their shot at something like Clint Capela and Robert Covington for about the same price they gave up for KP. Maybe I’m wrong though and they would’ve gotten something far worse as they waited for Giannis. At least THJ has been a great fit
"PG: Trae Young  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: De’Andre Hunter  PF: John Collins  C: Clint Capela   Reserves: Delon Wright, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish, Danilo Gallinari, Onyeka Okongwu."
Clint Capela followed up a 26 rebound game on 1/20 with 10 blocked shots on 1/22.
Clint Capela instead of any other of those C’s would help this team so much more.  The problem isn’t offence rather the mediocre C backing up the paint.
"Grant didn't play center because of the era he played in, he'd be fine today.  Horace was basically the same size as Clint Capela or Amar'e Stoudemire.   With Barkley to bang down low and all the length, athleticism &amp; speed from this roster I think they'd survive just fine even if they're a little ""small"" at the 5."
Miles Bridges dunk on Clint capela
Tobias Harris and Clint Capela
"This makes 0 sense for the Hawks. Clint Capela is a top 10 NBA center now, even if he’s not too highly discussed in the media."
"My guess was the Kings, but since 2011 the Rockets' favored partner was the Timberwolves, with 6 trades:  * Clint Capela out, Robert Covington in * Troy Daniels out, Corey Brewer in * cash out, Alessandro Gentile in * Chase Budinger out, Terrence Jones in * B.Miller/Mirotic/Parsons out, Flynn/Motiejunas in * cash out, Parsons right back in lol"
"He absolutely cannot. You can't point to one game's highlight youtube reel to show this off. Draymond has played the 5 in multiple important playoff series. Not stretches as a small ball 5, Draymond the primary guy against Clint Capela in Houston when the Warriors beat them."
The player you’re describing is like Clint Capela but a worse free throw shooter.
"I'm working my way through this case right now. An early claim is that Rodman has the top 7 rb% seasons. Since that graph was compiled, here are the rb% leaders by year (according to bball ref):  2009-10: Marcus Camby, 22.2%  10-11: Camby, 24.1%  11-12: Camby, 22.8%  12-13: Reggie Evans, 26.7%  13-14: Drummond, 22.3%  14-15: DeAndre Jordan, 24.5% (Drummond at 24.0%)  15-16: Drummond, 24.5%  16-17: Drummond, 25.2% (DJ at 24.2, Whiteside at 24)  17-18: DJ, 26.5% (Drummond at 26.2)  18-19: Whiteside, 25.9% (Drummond at 25.4%)  19-20: Drummond, 26%  20-21: Clint Capela, 26.1%  Now he ""only"" has 4 of the top 9 spots. The author could still have a case for the number of years Rodman was at the top (DJ and Drummond are the only two that sniff him), but the excellence of his peak has nearly been matched in this one stat that started the discussion. The argument actually gets a bit shakier due to the recent excellence: we've recently been raising the mean, which reduces how much Rodman stands out. Of course, scoring has been going up too, so MJ's excellence in that field doesn't stand out as much. Overall, it'd be cool to see this case made again."
"I didn’t think it was possible for a man as large as Embiid to do the things he did during that series. He made Capela look fucking small out there, and for those few times he wasn’t able to overpower Clint, Embiid would just hit a step back jumper or some shit. Dude was unreal."
"Lonzo  CJ McCollum  LeBron  Covington   Clint Capela   Bench: PatBev, Huerter, Ibaka"
https://www.spotrac.com/nba/atlanta-hawks/clint-capela-15377/
"$23m is very reasonable for Capela and what he brings to this team. Not only is he a great lob threat with Trae but he's a fantastic interior defender, which is pretty important when you're trying to hide Trae's defense. Jarrett Allen just got 20m on a deal that ends one year later. I know Allen is younger and has plenty of room to grow but Clint is probably better than Allen in each major aspect of their games right now.       Also the cap will go up significantly by the time this deal kicks in even if the league uses cap smoothing. It's likely that 23m in 24/25 could be the equivalent of 15m contract right now."
" @wojespn Atlanta Hawks center Clint Capela has agreed on a two-year, $46M extension, sources tell ESPN. He had two years left on his current deal and now is under contract through 2024-2025."
"Capela is mad underrated. If Jarrett Allen makes 20M/yr, sounds about right having Clint making 23M/yr"
Clint Capela over Jaylen Brown? Lol
"Maybe Morey is envisioning a 5 team trade where every team fleeces the next team by increasing amounts, so that by the time the trade loops back around the Sixers have Dame, and somehow Portland has Khris Middleton, Clint Capela, Devin Booker, and now Steve Nash is somehow back in the league and Brooklyn is coached by Harden and KD screaming at eachother"
"I agree 100%. The Pistons roster can definitely adjust to the modern game. Ben Wallace wasn't a terrible P&amp;R defender either, and the Pistons can use him like Clint Capela."
Clint Capela-lite
"The Clint Capela disrespect is crazy, he and Gobert are the ones competing for that 4th spot."
Clint Capela just put up 15-14-2 and basically single handedly turned the Hawks from a bad defense(after Hunter injury) to above average.  Clint Capela is just better than KAT.
"I think Walton would be a no-brainer for this list of he had been healthy and had sustained success for his career, but back-to-back seasons of 18 and 13 isn’t enough for me to personally having on my list. Clint Capela just put up 15 &amp; 14 last season, and he’s certainly nowhere near a top 10 all time list.   For me, my view on putting Bill Walton on a top 10 center list is like it is for putting Derrick Rose on a top 10 point guard list. Could he have been on it, if his career hadn’t been derailed by injuries? Absolutely. But there’s so many good players for me that it’s hard for me to account for “what if”’s.   And no worries… I love hearing other perspectives on basketball."
"The OP purposely left out large parts of the article. Other important information  &gt; That accept-the-qualifying-offer, bet-on-yourself tactic—in addition to client-poaching from other agents—has drawn ire from Paul's rivals in the agency world. To be fair, they are often guilty of the same activities; a significant portion of income for larger agencies is generated by poaching clients before a player's next lucrative deal.  &gt;The National Basketball Players Association does not prohibit certified agents from contacting other certified agents' clients, a noted contrast to the NBA's tampering rules, prohibiting team executives from contacting rival teams' talent. That stance has frustrated many agents for years.  &gt;And it's not just Paul.  &gt;Sources told Bleacher Report that Victor Oladipo was influenced to leave longtime representative Aaron Turner of Versus Management for Excel Sports just before free agency this summer. Excel gave Oladipo the same sales pitch: a new agent can deliver more money than the previous one. In this case, like Noel's, they didn't deliver.  &gt;Back in 2017, Robert Covington left his agent Chris Patrick (who helped land the two-way forward his first legitimate NBA stop in Philadelphia) for behemoth CAA Sports ahead of signing a four-year, $62 million deal.  &gt;Oladipo and Covington are merely two of a long list of examples.  &gt;The union has never shown much interest in policing such backchanneling. But a popular solution often mentioned by agents is saving 1 percent of the commission on a player's next contract for the previous representative, which would likely require some form of arbitration.  &gt;""It is wild to see all of it aired out like this,"" another veteran agent said. ""It happens all the time, but it never becomes public. It happens around the draft even. Guys will say anything to convince these players to come.""  &gt;Maybe these headlines do go away and Noel's filing was simply a public gesture against the agent he feels wronged him. ""I'll pay you this 200 grand, but I'm gonna s--t in your cornflakes before I do,"" one representative who previously worked with Noel said.  &gt;The majority of league sources contacted by B/R do expect the union to settle some type of agreement between these two parties, being that a legitimate legal battle benefits neither Klutch nor Noel. For Noel to win $58 million in alleged lost salary, he would seemingly face a daunting uphill battle in a court of law.  &gt;""The truth is Nerlens is not innocent in this,"" another agent said. ""If you're silly enough to turn down that kind of money, that's not on Rich.""  &gt;Paul's defense would be simple: An agent can never be held accountable for accurately predicting the future. He was providing a client with counsel, counsel that Noel did not have to accept, and if Noel did not suffer an injury, he very well could have garnered a richer deal.  &gt;That following summer, in 2018, Clint Capela scored a five-year, $90 million contract from the Rockets, a solid payday for a bouncy pick-and-roll threat and rim-protector of similar ilk.  &gt;Noel's case relies on the argument that Paul did not act in Noel's best interest, that Paul had no part in pitching the center to the Thunder in 2018 or sufficiently marketing him to other teams the following seasons.  &gt;It likely would be very challenging, however, for Noel's defense to find a team figure willing to come forward and confirm that series of events as a witness at trial. It's a sensitive topic that multiple league personnel declined to comment on for this article."

Was he a good rim runner ever? Is he a good athlete? I mean maybe for his size but that’s not saying much because there aren’t many people who are that big. but he’s not a Clint Capela/old school amare type player. He was never that. Maybe he was always going to be Hibbert at best. No excuse to take him that high
Bismack Biyombo  Clint Capela  Rudy Gobert
"Horford and Kanter are upgrades over what they had in the front court and JRich and Schroder can be useful role players, but everyone else that you listed is pretty unproven as of right now. I could see Pritchard and Time Lord making jumps but that happening is far from a given.  As for how they match up with the Hawks, I think the obvious solution for them to slow down Brown and Tatum would be to put DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish on them. I don’t think they’d shut them down but I also think those two combined with good rim protection from Clint Capela would at least cause some problems for the Celtics. I also don’t think the Celtics would be able to slow Trae down. He went against three top defenses in the post season and averaged 28 points and 9 assists"

"No 2K, I won’t resign Clint Capela to a 35 million dollar per year contract."
"I love that. I think Clint Capela at his best is easily a top 10 center and maybe top 5. Few centers effect winning as much as he does when he plays well. He is the prototypical PR guy the league fell in love with who plays end to end with high energy and great defense. He reminds of a Tyson Chandler at times in how good he is at the role he has.   Draymond is just this amazing engine of basketball. He is so, so intelligent on the court. I think he may be one of the best basketball minds there have ever been. He just understands offensive and defensive concepts so well."

"He acts like a child, he constantly pouts when things don't go his way. You see it in his play because he becomes less engaged on the court and the effort he plays with shrinks. If Andre could stick to what he's good at then he'd honestly be a much better player. Problem is that he's always thought that he's better than he is. His basketball IQ is nonexistent. The acrobatic layup attempts. Flashy passes. Boneheaded turnovers. You don't need that from your center. If he approached the game like a Jarrett Allen or Clint Capela he wouldn't be on a minimum deal right now."

"Honestly, it's also Clint Capela.  He's a threat at the rim that makes offensive players second guess going for one of the more solid closing scoring options."
"It was a tough shot to attempt.   It's the power of having a Clint Capela behind you though because Clint's going to just jump up and block whatever you put at the rim. He's too good.  And then you don't want to leave the game at the hands of a two, so it is what it is."

"What's the best (realistic, in terms of contracts/roles/ego) set of complimentary players to pair with Luka, for a team where he is clearly the best player? (E.g., I'm not including lineups where he teams up with other MVP-level players.)  Would you roll out two guards with him, or an extra wing? I feel like a heliocentric Luka team would need to focus on 3&amp;D role players.   We all know Cuban has coveted Klay for a long time and he's obviously the best complimentary piece to just about any star. Who else? Maybe Malcolm Brogdon for 3&amp;D plus secondary playmaking? Then add Robert Covington as a forward and Clint Capela as a defense/PNR dynamo?   Brogdon/Klay/Luka/RoCo/Capela is probably the best ""realistic"" team you could assemble around Luka, where he is the best player/center of the team. Anyone think they have a better one?"
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."

He's nothing more than a younger Clint Capela. I don't know where Suns fans get this idea he's sacrificing his offensive game for the team. He has brick hands. He still hasn't learned to stop putting the ball down low where guards knock it out of  his soft hands. He won't back down smaller defenders. He always kicks it out as soon as he feels someone on his back. Even when he does shoot it its more than likely not going in. His current offensive game is a jumper from the FT line or a fadeway jumper. Just once I want him to back down a smaller defender in the paint and slam it down. Year 4 I'm still waiting.
"Hey man, sometimes you’re the hammer and sometimes you’re the nail. I happened to be the nail today.  To be fair to me, he did face Clint Capela today lol"
"Are you really asking ""could 4 guys help them win as much as employing this one guy did""?  That's a low bar for FOUR PLAYERS. You think that, yeah they'd help.  I like all those guys except Harrell -- he's terrible on D and plays like small Clint Capela on offense, god bless the Clippers for finding a way to make him successful."

MVP TRAE YOUNG  DPOY DEANDRE HUNTER  MIP CAM REDDISH   6MOTY KVON HUERTER   ALL STAR JOHN COLLINS   1ST DEFENSIVE TEAM CLINT CAPELA
[Nugs fans know that the real nemesis is Clint Capela](https://www.landofbasketball.com/games_between/clint_capela_vs_nikola_jokic.htm)
Would a guy like Clint Capela be an accurate comparison?
If he can stay healthy I think he can be Deandre Jordan/Clint Capela with better passing.
"Doesn’t need to be good on offense. Garland and Sexton provide a lot of Offense. Mobley, if he’s as good as we think he’ll be, will stretch the floor along with Lauri. He just needs to be like what Clint Capela is."
Morey ended up having to trade away Clint Capela to create more space on the floor to make Westbrook fit next to Harden.    Lakers obviously aren't trading away Davis.  They're going to have a tough time figuring it out.  There just isn't enough space on the floor if Russ doesn't need to be defended at all off the ball.
"He was billed as an elite offensive center prospect, he's turned into Clint Capela."
Before pre-season I would have said CJ McCollum. He would have been an all star last year if he hadn't broken his foot (thanks Clint Capela).  But the blazers look like traaaaash in pre-season so I'm not so sure now.
"Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis.  Arguably Clint Capela and Nik Vucevic."
"&gt;*Can James Harden do for Nicolas Claxton what he did for Clint Capela?*  To me this is more *'Can Claxton do for Harden what Capela did for Harden?""*  Clint is a big part of the Hawks offense and defense and he's easily one of the best centers in the league. His defensive IQ is high and man can just go up and grab anything. (He can also go up and block almost anything, making players second guess if they want to put any feet in the paint. A great, great power to have on your team!)  And Trae's floater looking exactly like a lob is a damn game changer for Clint."
When was the last time Russ made an adjustment though? The Rockets traded Clint Capela for nothing just so Russ could have space.
"&gt;No better than Clint Capela.   Yeah bro, you're surely arguing from a position of facts and logic.   In the playoffs last year, Capela put up a 10/11 on 59%TS and could not stay on the floor in crunch time because he was shooting a cool 44% from the charity stripe.   In the playoffs last year, Ayton put up a 16/12 on 67%TS, including an excellent for a big man 75% from the charity stripe. He also turned the ball over on half the touches in comparison, and had nearly double the BPM, WS, and VORP of Capela."
"This article seems to agree with you...  **Is Deandre Ayton worth the max?**  Only four true centers in the NBA are making the max: Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. Include part-time centers like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo and the list still remains very exclusive. These are MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, NBA champions, and NBA All-Stars we're talking about here. Thus far, Ayton has not crossed any of these thresholds.  The going rate for centers in that next lower tier down is substantially lower. Clint Capela and Myles Turner are both making less than $20 million this season, and they were meaningfully better regular-season players than Ayton last year. Capela finished sixth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and Turner finished ninth. Ayton didn't receive a single vote. Capela out-scored and out-rebounded Ayton in the regular season.  Of course, Ayton has only played  three seasons, and while his pre-draft pedigree alone shouldn't guarantee him a max contract, it does suggest more room for improvement than a typical 23-year-old NBA player would have. That upside was visible in the postseason, when Ayton grew into the sort of elite play-finisher and defensive anchor Capela was all season for the Hawks. If Phoenix believes he can maintain that form, he's immediately worth more than Capela.  The top group of centers encompasses players who are either elite shot-creators (Jokic and Towns), elite defenders (Gobert and Adebayo) or, in the rare cases of Davis and Embiid, players who are elite in both areas. Ayton might one day enter either or both of those groups, and there might be teams willing to pay him on the hope that he does. For now, he's a tier below."
Lol y'all really think Clint Capela would have gone #1 overall?  He can shoot midrange and create on his own. His role just doesn't give him that much freedom. Understandably because they have Paul and Booker.
"And that led to them slumping out of the playoffs against a team without their best player, because Gobert couldn’t score against 6’8 guys and the team wasn’t good enough playing defense against Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann while Gobert was forced to stand in a corner. Like I said there’s a cap on your teams success. Paying Gobert 40 million means Mitchell has to ascend to a top 5 player to compensate. Whereas when you use your maxes on players who can give you production (Giannis&amp;Middleton/ Bron&amp;AD/ Steph&amp;KD/ Harden&amp;CP3) you can have Kevon Looney or Brook Lopez or Clint Capela at center and be a better more dangerous team."
He’s not a star lol. He’s a role player like Clint Capela
"OKC doesn't, with the dead money from the Kemba buyout and the SGA extension they are nowhere near max space in '22.  So it's really just the Spurs and Pistons.  Which, maybe those teams make the offer but I don't think it's a no-brainer to do that, especially when guys like Myles Turner and Clint Capela will probably be very gettable via trade at much more palatable numbers around then."
"Unproven guy ; was a kinda non factor before Chris Paul , should get Clint Capela money or less"
"Not only that, people saying he’s “basically Clint Capela” usually underrate how good Clint Capela is too. I think it’s just people who like being contrarian/don’t really know what they’re talking about."
"Tristan Thompson, Serge Ibaka, Russ, Patrick Ewing, Jokic, Dennis Rodman, Timelord, Al Horford, Clint Capela"
U made no sense. If I think he’s Clint Capela and Clint Capela isn’t making the max that means I need to check my logic that Ayton makes the max???? U check ur own logic lmao
"If you think he's equal to Clint capela at this poj t and don't think he deserves a max, you need to check your logic.  Capela is paid 25 mil per year. And he just got extended at 24 mil per year.  Ayton is 22 and still improving. You bet on the back end when he's even better that the 35 mil he's making looks like a bargain."
"Ayton is like a low level All-Star at best. It’s pretty easy to find replacement centers in the league. Ayton is not that good of an offensive player and isn’t an elite defender, either. He’s like a more offensively skilled Clint Capela. It’s wise to wait and see if he can show some more this season before offering a max to a high end role player."
"Honestly, I'm not sure where this talk about DPOY-level defence came from. His advanced stats (box plus minus) say he is +0.0 on-off for defence. Other stats say +1.6 on RAPTOR which is good but nowhere near the better centers like Capela at +6.0 or Embiid at +4.6 or Gobert at +7.9 or 201920 AD at +4.3.  His counting stats are at 1.2 blocks and 0.7 steals, which are counting stats but every DPOY center has 2-3 blocks.  No one is legitimately paying him 172 mil when most stats give someone like Clint Capela (~20mil per year) is more valuable by almost all metrics. Even if the Nuggets didn't have Jokic, no-one is crazy enough to give him that offer sheet.  Plus, the post- or declining Chris Paul era is pretty uncertain. And you've just seen Rudy Gobert being played off the court by small ball lineups in the form of the Clippers.  They could've justified offering the max and providing little leeway to improve the roster next offseason. However, I find it perfectly logical to wait it out."
No I said they made it the conference finals also bc Simmons was terrible lol. Yea and like Clint Capela he shouldn’t have a max very similar players. They can be strong pieces but if they were ever left alone to pick up the slack ur team would be miserable.
It’s not tho he’s Clint Capela he can indeed be replaced. And he didn’t prove himself on the biggest stage when going against the only full strength squad in the playoffs he was ho hum...MPJ has the chance to be an elite scorer which is just simply more valuable then being a good defender with limited offensive abilities.
2010 Magic  Jamal Murray (Jameer Nelson)  Caris LeVert (Vince Carter)  Torrey Craig (Matt Barnes)  Nicolas Batum (Rashard Lewis)  Clint Capela (Dwight Howard)
I just don't think he has potential to be much more than Clint Capela
He's not better though. He's Clint Capela if he was a worse defender and somewhat better scorer. They're very similar impact players.
I think it's pretty clear that if he was an UFA he'd get maxed imo. Upside is still there. At worst he's 2018 Clint Capela. At best he's that + a post threat.
"He’s better Clint Capela. People will act like that’s an insult but it’s not. That’s a super valuable player but not worth $172m. That said, they’re going to match whatever he gets in RFA"
"Clint Capela, identical to Ayton, is one of the biggest reasons his team made the conference finals. Without him their defense would be a sieve"
"Letting Ayton walk would be an extraordinarily dumb decision, if the Mavs got their hands on him, or... the Clippers? Wow. This guy's got value we just saw this with Clint Capela. Capable defensive bigs add a ton of value and can win you a playoff series, even if everyone's going small."
"So many guys have balled out once and not lived up to their contract it’s that type of thinking u have right now that leads to it. He’s Clint Capela but on the Suns, unless he shows an improved arsenal that we haven’t seen this year."
"The Hawks now have Trae Young locked up through 2027, John Collins and Kevin Huerter through 2026, and Clint Capela through 2025"
"As a point of comparison, Ayton wants $20M more *per year* than what the Hawks just paid Clint Capela on an extension last month. Is Ayton worth nearly 2X what Capela and JJJ are getting paid? I don’t see it."
If you think he's Clint Capela you're not watching him lol
"I mean it depends how much you will think he can develop   Right now he's basically Clint Capela, a good player but not a max player"
"Clint Capela. He'd be so fucking good on the Mavs, both on offense and on defense. Ayton too but that's too unrealistic"
"Man this made me curious as to just how bad this is. My first shot was to go back to 2014.  They picked Jordan Adams 22nd. Rodney Hood and Clint Capela went in the next three picks. Ouch.   In 2015, the Grizzlies selected Jarell Martin 25th. Two picks later Larry Nance Jr. goes. Wow would this have changed history.   2016 is tough, hard to know who they would've taken at the time but Wade Baldwin at 17 surely was not the answer. Two of the next three picks...Malik Beasley and Caris LeVert.   2017 didn't select anybody.  2018 JJJ! A hit! Sure they could have had Trae Young, but I think they are happy with what they have in Ja and JJJ."
2017 Clint capela was his prime. If you switch DA in that rockets vs warriors series. DA probably gets torched.
"&gt; He was told to subsume his individual stats for the sake of the team. He did. It worked. Now, basically, they're saying he's not worth a max because his numbers aren't All-NBA.  There's zero scenario in which Ayton was going to put up All-NBA numbers. He doesn't have the handles, shooting, or advanced post/midpost shotmaking ability, or passing to run an offense through him in an efficient way. What you're calling unselfish was him just playing the role he's best at while being fed by a top 5 facilitator of all time.  Who knows where he'll be down the road, but right now he's as close (or closer) to Clint Capela as Embiid in offensive ability."
Pretty much. He’s not significantly better than a prime Clint capela.
Like that one pre-season ranking for Centers that put him and Clint Capela above Bam and Kat?
"I'm with you  This guy was basically just the Suns' Clint Capela for a playoff run and people are talking like he just had a 2018-Jokic-type playoffs.  So why would the Thunder max Ayton when they can just wait a year and make a run at Capela or Myles Turner in UFA? Granted those guys are older but the thing is if you need to trade for this type of guy you can (see: Atlanta trading for Capela when they were ready to push their chips in), so you can always cycle another guy in with your million late firsts as whoever you bring in ages out.  To me it makes to keep drafting, see if you find the second guy you want to max, and, if that guy is not a center, then you start trying to bring via FA or trade a guy on that Jakob Poeltl (low-end) / Capela (mid-tier) / Ayton (high-tier) quality spectrum."
"&gt; But he’s not a starter. He can be used in specific match-ups, and has quite limited offensive skills (shooting wise).  There's so much wrong in here I don't know where to start.  Williams is Clint Capela with elite passing ability.  Even if Williams were nothing more than an athletic rim runner who plays above the rim, he'd be a useful force on offense - just like Capela.  But his passing ability adds a huge extra dimension that allows him to space the floor just as well as any big who can shoot.    And even putting all that aside - his defense alone is worthy of 30 minutes a game.  Teams straight up play offense differently when he's in there."
Clint Capela for DPOY
"What was his supporting cast like that season?  - He had Dwight Howard who averaged less than 14 PPG   - Trevor Ariza was solid, but still averaged only 12.7 PPG   Everyone else averaged less than 10 PPG   Patrick Beverly, sophomore Clint Capela, and Donatas Motiejūnas who was out of the league half way into next season.   In terms of a season drop off, Kawhi Leonard took a big jump and the Spurs were great. OKC who was injured in 2015 was healthy"
"I'm not sure why I'd need to pick between Andre Drummond thinking he's Michael Jordan and Andre Drummond thinking he's Ben Simmons.   Knowing your role is a *huge* part of understanding how to play effective basketball. Cavaliers-era Tristan Thompson was an asset because he tried to play like Tristan Thompson, not LeBron2. Clint Capela is an asset, despite his limitations, because he *knows* those limitations.   There's a reason why we never saw Mavericks-era Tyson Chandler calling for an iso on the wing or Clippers-era DeAndre Jordan looking off Chris Paul following a defensive rebound so he could run point on the break himself. Those guys knew their roles.   Whenever Andre happened to have a game where he was able to limit himself from trying to do all the things he's terrible at, he proved he could be an asset. But more times than not, especially late in his Pistons career, dude just couldn't resist a tasty 3-point attempt or one-on-one dual culminating in an off-balance contested banking runner."

"knicks fan as well, honestly it’s annoying to play against but that’s why i liked him. clint capela annoyed me too but he’s great. bogdan was just being gracious about his mistakes the whole series and saying great things in interviews and i could not hate him.   the hawks in general were likable asf and i was rooting for them and the bucks to make it out of the second round and shock everyone. i’m glad it happened."
Feels like yesterday I was telling people Bruno Fernando would be the next Clint Capela. I stand by that take 🐢
" IT's not around the Key, just on the wide edges (unless that'swhat you meant). Its the baseline spot on either side just outside and below the blocks or a step in.  allowing for a guy to have a maximum angle and space opportunity to catch lobs or quick dishes off of penetration.

"How were things any less tough for Wiseman…  He missed all of training camp because he caught COVID, and then he was expected to come in as a starter and help us win games on a playoff team. When he couldn’t do that, we were forced to bench him and then he got hurt and missed the rest of the season.   And even if he doesn’t never end up as good as Ball or Edwards, I don’t see how that automatically means we will regret picking him. At the end of the day, making sure he’s a good player is more important than making sure he’s better than everyone else in his draft class. He may not be Joel Embiid, but if he can end up as a Clint Capela I think that’s fine too."
"Easy  PG: Lonzo Ball SG: Jordan Poole SF: MPJ PF: Myles Turner ( if he was an all star, then OG Anoby)  C: Clint Capela"

Clint Capela lol
"Clint Capela has missed the playoffs once in his entire career, and he somehow always ends up playing with god-tier playmakers."
East:   Sharife Cooper - Bogdan Bogdanovic - De'Andre Hunter - John Collins - Clint Capela 😈

"Lol you think scouts would pick him first overall for basically being Clint Capela?  He has shot creation skills and even decent jump shot. His role in Monty's system is basically just being the roll man, rebound, play defense. That's why that's the only thing that casuals see, but doesn't mean it's all."
let him test RFA. because hes not a max guy. if you get spoon fed by chris paul and booker you get paid like clint capela.
"There's definitely a lot of uncertainty around Wiseman. We need to see both what he's been able to do in this off-season in terms of working on his game while limited (even if it's just watching film until the game slows down), and also what kind of role/minutes the team puts on him. I'd like to see him getting 10-15 minutes a game to start off with, being asked to just run PnR with Poole in the second unit, get rebounds, and protect the paint--basically ask him to play like Clint Capela for a while."
I'd take Clint Capela over Bam if we're only taking about interior defense

"Clint Capela is ninth  It's not about ranking the best players, in this case it's about the impact each player has on their team specifically"
"I’m a Hawks fan and I don’t think Capela is better than KAT. I would rather have Capela on my team, though. Capela is an objectively better defender, and he’s good for 15 a night. KAT is good for 25 and an incredible offensive player. His defense isn’t dogshit, but it’s not good.  I think KAT is more talented, but Capela has more heart and grit and is asked to do a different job. Like when he’s playing against someone like Embiid or Giannis, you can tell they are stronger than Clint, but Clint doesn’t back down and stays in their way and makes them fight for their points."
"I’m a Hawks fan, so Clint Capela"
Easily Capela. LMA and Blake can try to fill Vucs scoring. Nobody can fill the length and rebounding Capela could give. Putting Clint on Giannis would be nasty.
Rockets legend Clint Capela
"#Pass  Would much rather keep Clint Capela as he had a better season offensively and defensively. You could argue the offensive development is a result of playing with Trae Young but its kinda useless to mention that without CP3/ayton.  And although I do believe that Ayton will soon be better, id still much rather have Capela for the next 4 years at $18.5m/yr than Ayton on a frickin max that could be bumped up to $41m/yr if he makes a pair of ASGs or all nba...  What a ridiculous waste of team cap ayton straight up is not that guy (nowhere near it yet, huge gamble to pay him and bet that he grows into it)"
Just play him as a rim-running center. Put him in the pick n roll with Harden and tell Ben to act like he's Clint Capela.
"TLDR: I’m not saying Russell isn’t great or deserving to be ranked where he is. I just meant that if we look at the statistics that are available (which don’t tell us a complete picture anyways), his placement seems odd.  ——  I’m not saying Russell isn’t an all-time great. I’m just saying on the surface level, from what statistics are available, it’s not really obvious why he is placed as high as he is. But that’s part of why I made this post: numbers can’t tell the full story.   He averaged 15 points for his career on below-average efficiency (his rTS is a slight negative). He wasn’t known for his scoring, yeah, but offense is critical and he was bad at it. From what I’ve seen he does look like a smart passer and it shows in his APG numbers.  He is known for his defense, but there aren’t any valuable statistics that I know of available from that era. His rebounding numbers are impressive, but they’re still overrated by a lot of people. As impressive as his rebounding numbers were, it’s not like he was far-and-wide the best rebounder of his era even. He only led the league in RPG twice after Wilt joined. And 22 RPG is very impressive, but I think a lot of people fall into the trap of thinking about 22 RPG from today’s standards. In 1963, 4 people averaged more than 18.5 RPG. The RPG leader in today’s NBA was Clint Capela at 14.3.   I’m just saying it’s hard to say his statistics are amazing when many of today’s defensive metrics/stats weren’t recorded back then. All we know is that he was average, at best, on offense and the 2nd best rebounder of his era."
If Sarver's being a cheap asshole I could totally see Atlanta trying to swap Clint Capela for him
CP3 and Clint Capela aren't bums.
"CP3, Clint Capela and Westbrook are no bums."
&gt;I guess that means by your logic Clint Capela is a better defender than Giannis since Centers defence is more important  False equivalency. For one Giannis is an elite interior defender and quasi 2nd C with more versatility. He literally also plays C often. Capela also isn't even the 4th best defensive C.  Laughable logic.
"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."

"So, it was a mix of three things, mostly, I'll list them in order that I deem importance.  1. Clint Capela was playing very bad. Like, awful. He's always been a slow starter, but he did some rehabbing over the off-season and has only just got into playing shape over the winning streak. He was bad offensively and defensively up until now.  2. Schedule. We played some very tough teams, had a west coast trip against all their best teams with multiple back to backs, all while Clint was slumping.  3. When Hunter was healthy in the starting lineup, while his on ball defense is great, he was a bit of a ball stopper, and it infected a lot of the entire starting lineup. We didn't run an offense so much as we exclusively hunted mismatches. It was pretty bad, but I list it as 3rd because due to talent our offense was still mostly fine. The bigger issue was, missed shot bled into transition points and Clint being bad defensively just exasperated the whole issue.  We're playing much better RN. Also helps Trae Young is absolutely fucking bonkers. He has a real mid range game (I think his shooting % from midrange is in the 60's rn) and his three point shot is falling due to better selection and him just being hot.  On the up swing!"

"? KD's injury didn't impact anything. We won the games he was playing and lost the games he was injured. If he was playing, we would have likely lost too because CP3 wasn't his usual self except the last game and Clint Capela played badly. They aren't excuses if you're criticising the level of play of the players, so I'm not sure what you think we're ignoring. An injury is unfortunate and unlucky, bad playing is something else entirely."
CP3 was washed that year and every game that series still came down to the final shots. Any game could have swung any way but 2019 chris paul wasn’t 2018 chris paul.

Clint Capela had 5 steals tonight. Really take a moment to let that sink in.   Trae is great. Him having a midrange he can bust out is great. Lots of our team has attempted to add to their games during the off-season and it's encouraging to see.
"&gt;It’s funny you point this out in a discussion about a player who you’re defending who has a direct hand in those outcomes.  I point this out because Ben Simmons has been in the league only a few years and has clearly been chosen as the scapegoat for the 76ers' incompetence, which started way before he got there.  &gt;A player who hasn’t shown an inkling of improvement in a basic and fundamental basketball skill in 5 NBA seasons... year after year of NO, I repeat, NO progress in shooting, which culminated into what happened in Game 7.  Do Dwight Howard and Clint Capela also have work ethic problems for not becoming better free throw shooters? Jimmy Butler's 3 point shot has been broken for like 3 seasons, does he have work ethic problems? Prime Rondo was on a superteam and was a terrible shooter, did he have work ethic problems? Some people just aren't shooters dude. This sub's obsession with shooting is so strange.  He has improved his game in other ways, notably taking huge leaps defensively since entering the league. Ya'll (fans + Doc Rivers in particular) ran a 3x all star, 2x all-defense, and 1x all-NBA player out of town because he had 1 bad playoff run and now you have to deal with the consequences.  If the Heat threw Jimmy Butler under the bus for sucking against the bucks and blamed him for getting swept he (and any other star in the league) would have done the same thing Simmons did. So again, this is 99% on the Sixers. They burned the bridge."
"Bingo! I wish more of our fans understood that.   Got people pointing at what Garbua is doing w/ RGV and saying he should've got minutes with the Rockets and, no, that's now how that works *at all*. JC really needs to be sent down to RGV to get minutes at that speed for a season or so, then see how he looks getting rotational minutes with the Rockets.  Sengun was the Turkish league MVP - dude is ready for NBA minutes. Garuba is close, but I personally think he needs to marinade w/ RGV for their season. Christopher is incredibly rough around the edges, but he's the exact type of dude that seems like he just needs some minutes at the G-League level to smooth his game out.  Hartenstein, K.J. Martin, KPJ, Gary Payton II, Montrezl Harrell, Clint Capela, Robert Covington - all those dudes put in minutes with RGV and are starting or getting significant minutes off the bench.

"I think I'm pretty impartial despite being a Rockets supporter. The officiating was absolutely horrendous tonight. Real amateur hour (check the post game thread) but imo they called the fouls equally for both teams.  There were also 2 or 3 deliberate fouls on Harden from the Magic late in the 4th to keep the game clock alive.  So did he earn them? Yeah, majority of them were earned the hard way, a few were from deliberate fouls and then a couple were soft superstar calls.   The Nets offense did resemble the old Houston offense with LMA in a Clint Capela role. This meant the ball was in Harden's hands all game which helps account for the sheer number of fouls on him (like, who else can the Magic foul if no other Net has the ball?)"

"Denver local fans are convinced that Barton is a very good player. I guess only they and 5% of other people in the world  Ballhog who plays terribly defensively and who will give the ball mostly to Jokic (to not upset him) while rarely giving the ball to others. Denver played WCF without Barton. Denver would never pass Utah and the Clippers with him because rarely does anyone play well next to him except Jokic  Murray with Barton-- nothing special  Murray without Barton-- star with 30, 40 even 50 points   Porter without Barton - 20/25 points  Porter with Barton-- very bad   His figures are a mirage, an illusion   Just look at the statistics from his playoff and everything will be clear to you  Denver’s biggest mistake were Millsap and Barton but no one there realizes that  How is it possible that literally all players go backwards except Jokic? It's Barton ballhog effect, next to him rarely anyone will be good in 80% of cases  He will have his average of 15-16 points and some assists, but that is why others will be mostly worse  He is literrary bigger version of Denis Smith junior and no coach would tolerate him except Malone.   I make a screenshot where Barton stands inside next to Clint Capela waiting for rebounds-- while his player stands alone at 8 meters and hits for 3 😁 And then local fans call me hater. Imagine leaving your player at 7-8 meters alone and chasing rebounds? Nobody is allowed to tell him that there. Malone is afraid of him. Murray exploded without Barton, Porter was also much better.

Or is it the superstar trio he drafted in Marcus Morris, Clint Capela and Nic Batum (probably his three best draftees since ‘07)?"
"That's what Hawks fans thought. The team has fixed Bradley Beal, Clint Capela and made Derrick Rose the best player on the Knicks. Westbrook is going to go 4-6 from 3 just watch it."
"That argument was made a long time ago and is becoming shakier due to DeAndre Jordan, Drummond, Clint Capela, among others  he still has a clear cut argument for GOAT status due to dominance and sustained excellence, but calling him better at rebounding than MJ is at scoring or Steph is at 3s isn't as convincing as it was 15 years ago"
"Him being 3 inches taller than the next Warriors player as a start. Really need him if we want to match up with the MVP level bigs like Giannis, Jokic and Embiid. Obviously he'll still get cooked by those guys but it's better than asking Draymond to guard them all night. Plus before he went down last year the coaching staff simplified his role a ton and he began to look pretty playable. Obviously not hoping for him to come back and be Clint Capela but it'll be nice to have."
"No, Curry, KD, Giannis, and Clint Capela are all better"
"[Dispelling Myths Around Gobert’s Defense](https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/)  &gt; Myth #1: Gobert can’t guard on the perimeter  &gt; Let’s start with isolation defense. This year, there were 87 players that guarded at least 50 isolations. **If mainstream highlight reels are your source of information here, you’d expect to see Rudy at the bottom of the pack. Actually, the opposite is true**. Gobert allows the seventh fewest points per possession (PPP). Opponents score an average of 0.71 points per isolation when Gobert is defending. **That’s less than Simmons (0.73), Anunoby (0.76), Bam Adebayo (0.78), Mikal Bridges (0.97), Giannis Antetokounmpo (1.06), Clint Capela (1.07), and Myles Turner (1.08)**. Gobert also allows the third lowest scoring frequency (30.6%), the eighth lowest FG% (32%), and the fourth lowest FT throw frequency (4.7%) when guarding opponents in isolation.  Wait, so you don't think having 4 other meh to poor defenders on your team would contribute to a DPOY centre getting dunked on? How do you think an offensive player gets a chance to dunk on Gobert? They have to first get downhill into the paint, which would mean they blow by their defender in isolation (which happens a lot for the Jazz) or through handoffs/screens. If you have bad defenders, do you think it makes it easier or harder for a player to get into the paint with enough freedom to go up and dunk on a 7'1 DPOY centre? And do you think having bad defenders would hold up an offensive player long enough for a big man to get into help position and ready up for a good contest vs being late on the contest? Defense is a team game, not even Rudy Gobert can single handedly cover up all the issues with the Jazz's defense, issues that aren't on him but his teammates and the coaching staff having a defensive system that is ""let Rudy Gobert just clean up your fuck ups""."
"He was more than just a rebounder, dude was a bouncy bouncy big that blocked shots and caught lobs. Made the dunk contest too lol. He was like what Clint Capela is now, except as a rookie. But he regressed once he made an all star game, it went to his head and he tried to become a superstar when in reality he became a bum"

"The 90s had all-time greats listed here. For Joker's era, it's a lot better so you right, but other Cs that have a shot at all-time greats is Joel Embiid... maybe KAT, and depends on if we want to flub positions for Giannis and AD. Where are we on Clint Capela and Mile Turner?  Joker is pretty awesome, but his going up against greats who had to battle out other greats (and they get the nostalgia boost)  All I'm saying this era makes is weird for Centers."
"Rockets-  CP3, Harden, Russ, Melo, Kyle Lowry, Dragic, PJ Tucker, Dwight Howard, Clint Capela, Marcus Morris, Trevor Ariza, Oladipo, Boogie Cousins.  I think that should suffice."
Best game of the year so far from Clint Capela
Real Story:  Clint Capela looked great tonight. Thats two good games back to back by him. Think he's getting healthy.  Clint doing what he does is huge to this team and i think often that goes understated.
I hear Clint Capela is a decent defensive rebounder. KAT for CC straight up. Take it or leave it.

Clint Capela dunks in front of Grayson Allen
"You literally just made this up LMAO. There was never a time in Capela career where he just “sat at the 3 point line.” It’s Clint Capela.   Because of lineups and because Harden is still good at basketball … if you’re logic is his improvement came at a detriment of the team, then his on off LOGICALLY wouldn’t have improved…think.   You people say outrageous things about Russ and call everybody who downvotes you or disagree “stans.” Meanwhile try to convince others Russ had Capela sitting at the fucking 3 point line. What a joke 😂😂"
"If the trade starts with Capela, they gotta come up with enough to get Karl AND dump Clint!"
Guess they've never heard of Clint Capela or PJ Tucker
"&gt;""A decade of stagnation"" is such a reductionist and lazy take. There's no way we would have extended him for 4/$54m if he was as disappointing as you seem to believe. He's been genuinely brilliant at times for us, and still has value in this league.  I've never doubted he's a good player.  But you seem to think has value = worth a first.  Guys like Danny Green, PJ Tucker, Jordan Clarkson and Jae Crowder have all been traded for less.  Danny Green + offloading 30m in bad money = a 1st.  Ross still has value in the league, but a 1st is a ludicrous price for a bench spark plug.  Why would teams spend a full 1st on a role player when there are comparable decent players available for cheaper?  Would you put Terrance Ross on the same level as someone like Clint Capela?  Because Atlanta only spent a 1st on Capela.  &gt;Him ""realising his full potential"" - whatever that is - is also a moot point. Who cares.  &gt;The only thing that matters is the player that he's become.   100% agree and that's exactly what I've been saying.  You kept saying he could be this, he could be that.    *""I could certainly see one of the main contenders rolling the dice and giving up what would be a late 1st rounder.""*  ...  *""what TRoss could bring to the right team""*   Who cares?  Teams don't roll the dice on 30 year olds. His value is entirely based on his past production. Potential doesn't factor in.  He is what he is, which is decent but still not worth a 1st."
"Clint Capela has visibly lost a step after nursing an Achilles injury all off season and our backup C, Onyeka Okongwu, is out for half the season.  We’re getting obliterated in the paint, over correcting and then getting obliterated on the perimeter."
"Nate Mcmillan changed our whole scheme even though our team was the same from last year  Made Bogie the number 3-4, not getting that much shots for him  Making Huerter not create that many more shots  Going for more Trae-Clint rather than Trae-JC pnrs  And JC going more aggro from three point range, which he is making, but just not used to  And also Capela being terrible"

Being 29th in defense is a big culprit of their slump. Clint Capela looks like a shell of his former self.  Also Nate McMillan has started to…McMillan-ize their offense. There’s no reason the Hawks should be only 13th in offense when Trae is playing like this and they have so much offensive talent on this roster
"You mean Fatsuit, Mini Clint Capela, and the Marsha Brady of the Ball family?!"
Ayton is kind of like Clint Capela. A traditional center who can protect the rim and get board. Lob him a dunk when you’re out of options. I think Clint is honestly better than Ayton still and he doesn’t even get the max.
It gives you flexibility to start building a defense though. Get a Richaun Holmes or Clint Capela type guy and that's an interesting squad
"I wish we had the 2nd pick a year later lol. Imagine Evan Mobley on this Warriors team, whose floor looks like it'll be Clint Capela. His ceiling is the roof"
"Hmmm maybe they consider trading for someone like, oh I don’t know just spitballin here, Clint Capela. Totally random unbiased with no ulterior motives"
" How lucky is Chris Paul with his big men? Had a dominant Tyson Chandler, Deandre Jordan, Clint Capela, and now Ayton, McGee, and Frank on one team! They all deserve maxes"
3pt% is an inherently flawed metric for this because the best shooters shoot more often. Like Clint Capela doesn’t pull down the ATL hawks 3pt% because he shoots zero a game.   But the spacing after we traded Powell was not great
"A center who doesn’t set screens, pass well, post up, or dribble isn’t worth 20 million a year.  I’m not saying he’s a bad player, but he’s certainly not paying as much as a Clint capela or a terry rozier. Anyone who isn’t a major homer would probably agree with me here."

"fans want him out for clint capela and like, a pick lol  we aren't smart"
Not at all. Clint Capela is one of the most athletically gifted players to come into the league shockingly enough. Graded out at 9/10 athleticism scores prior to the draft and has only bulked up since then. Then you combine that with being 6-11 and having a 7-5 wingspan who used to play power forward due to these athletic talents so their athleticism is closer than you would think.
"Do you think Michael Jordan and Klay Thompson have similar physical gifts? No? That’s what comparing Clint capela to Giannis is. Is Clint capela a good athlete for his size? Sure.  Giannis is arguably the best athlete at his size EVER. It’s like him and wilt. No one else has their combination of height, strength, and mobility."
"The issue I have with this argument, and I truly do understand what you’re saying, is that shouldn’t every 7 footer be capable of what Giannis does if it only comes down to size/athleticism? Like you have Clint capela, amazing size, great athlete, shouldn’t he be doing what Giannis does since he has similar physical gifts?"
"Yeah plus Clint Capela pulls rebounds and attacks the rim like a mad man, that's not Ben"
No Mike Dunleavy Jr. bullshit - he picks up his sixth foul midway through the fourth fighting with Clint Capela for a rebound.   https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=703&amp;GameID=0021900015&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Antetokounmpo%20S.FOUL%20(P6.PN)%20(T.Washington)&amp;sct=plot
"My wife calls Clint Capela Mr Toothpaste Stain and I have yet to come up with an explanation for why he looks like that she finds satisfying.  ""He thinks it looks good.""  ""He's wrong."""
Clint Capela is a fucking scrub this year. On both ends of the floor. It’s like the movie thunderstruck
Clint capela on offense
"Most good teams don't need a scoring big like Embiid. I think he has intrigue as a roller and switchable 5, but obv it seems he wants to be more than a mini Clint Capela who can pass."
This is true.  He was in the dunker's spot more than Bjelica the last few games.  GP2 is the Warriors Clint Capela with a better three pointer and perimeter.
"USC fan here, watched every one of his college games. He looks way more capable offensively than I expected. In college he didn't really have a ""bag"" or any kind of counter moves to create his own shot down low other than just being bigger than everyone. I expected him to be more of a Rudy Gobert/Clint Capela type of player on offense whose main offense would be lobs and putbacks. But he looks a lot more polished than I expected."
"Raptor War has had some ""interesting results"" from there metrics;  For instance last year 2020-21 they had Clint Capela 9th and Steph Curry 10th.  They had Mika Bridges 13th and Mike Conley 16th and Nic Batum at 22nd!"
Well it’s certainly not Clint Capela I can tell you that much

Westbrook would've been more highly regarded in the 80s and 90s   Clint Capela would've been a franchise centerpiece in the 80s  Steve Francis would've been a top 10 player in today's league
What can you do offensively Mr. Wood? Aren't you a Clint Capela?

"What are you talking about? Harden had Dort on him who is the best defender of Harden I've ever seen. That obviously impacted Harden. The Rockets won 3 blowouts thanks to Harden and lost two close games.    Harden's supporting cast was Covington, Rivers, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker. Thanks to Westbrook he lost Clint Capela which meant no more pick and roll as well.   Like in Game 6, Harden got Russ a wide open jumper with the game on the line and Russ fucking airballed."
The John Collins to Clint Capela connection is my favorite thing of this new season so far.

"RoCo, Steven Adams, Russ, Furkan Korkmaz, Clint Capela.... technically Gerald Green (FOR NOW HOPEFULLY)... Embiid, Wenyen Gabriel, Jeff Green,  K-Love, Ja, Sabonis, KAT... I think that's most of them. No specific reason just dudes I like"
Big facts. To me he's more like a supercharged Clint Capela.
He’s actually pretty promising. Not like an all star promising but Clint Capela type big with passing promising
So your contention is this team would be a playoff team with a healthy KAT? He’s pretty much played every game for most of his career and the team stayed ass. Then you blame teammates. Only time they even looked normal was when he was second fiddle to Butler. Same time dude was getting outplayed by Clint Capela in the playoffs. He doesn’t impact games like his stats suggest. Never did. This team would be lottery regardless of how many games he plays.
"I may be a delusional Suns fan, but he will for sure get it. Chris Paul has a knack for making every big man he plays with great. Mans got Clint Capela a serious bag from Houston while there"

"??? Does Clint Capela not exist? Sure, JC is no rim protector, but Capela was one of the best defensive bigs when he played for the Rockets last year"
Clint Capela with 12-11-6 after not seeing NBA Action for about a calendar year.
Clint Capela woke up feelin dangerous unironically
&gt;Hox Bigs  Yeah The ghost of Clint Capela and Bruno Fernando are really scary
"Deandre Jordan can not be letting half healthy Clint "" I aint played basketball in a calendar year"" Capela put moves on him"
"I get it, you're very confident in off-brand Clint Capela. My only regret is not making you bet anything because this is the easiest wager I've ever made in my entire life."
"That doesnt have shit to do with who is better. Brons taken 3 different teams to a finals win. Harden hasn't even brought the rockets into the final game while playing with players like Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul. Clint Capela and Eric Gordon when he was actually still really good"
Why do y’all act like he’s Rudy Gobert or Clint Capela lmao?
This is one of the hardest teams to try and reconstruct because they weren’t superstars but they fit really well  Chauncey Billups- Kyle Lowry  Rip Hamilton- Joe Ingles  Tayshaun Prince- Talen Horton-Tucker   Rasheed Wallace- Michael Porter Jr.   Ben Wallace- Clint Capela   The team that I built isn’t as good on defense but is better offensively
"Marc Gasol ranks 4th in D-Lebron this season behind only Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, and Clint Capela.   You can doubt the metric if you want, but this is clearly not a 2015 Peyton Manning situation where every stat is saying this QB is terrible now."
"i mean at the time you had an overweight dude from Serbia who had come off of a good year playing in Serbia and who had averaged 3.5 assists. So basically he was closer to a normal center with good passing fundamentals.   Even in his first year in the league you had a guy that was doing 2.4 assists, and while he was very good, was there indicators of him becoming the kind of player he is today (I didn't watch Denver back then). Like even the per 36 numbers his rookie year didn't show that court vision potential off.   For every Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic you end up with a Darko Milicic or Dragan Bender, it's a total crap shoot dealing with the draft and to call these guys idiots when they still had the idea to draft and pick him up still shows that someone viewed him as a prospect with potential.   You can't predict how a player will develop over time, it's pretty idiotic of you to say that these guys are idiots considering they literally have to evaluate 100+ potential players every year that may be worth picking up. 2014 was a draft of underrated gems, Joe Harris and Jerami Grant were both second rounders, Dwight Powell who just put on a show last night with Luka went after Jokic. Potential 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson went at 46. Clint Capela at 25, there were so many great prospects that were drafted all across the board not to mention guys like LaVine and Julius Randle going later in the first round. Everyone is going to remember 2014 for being the a low key bust for the biggest prospects from Wiggins and Parker when in reality it's going to go down as a sleeper draft where some truly elite players went very late in, likely a very difficult draft to call."
Well said about the Trae-Capela thing.   One other feather in the cap of Clint is his consistency. The dude brings it EVERY SINGLE  night.   He has completely changed the outlook and confidence of this team and I absolutely cannot wait time see what our defense can look like when Clint/Hunter/Cam/Dunn are all out there at once.
"I think it's a meme to say Capela has been better than Trae since he relies sooooo much on Trae's creation, but Clint has basically turned into the idealized version of himself, and is playing like a borderline all-star.  He's having the most dominant rebounding seaaon the NBA the NBA has seen in years, and he might legitimately be the 2nd most impactful defender in the league this season."
Clint Capela and there isn’t another answer
Unbiased opinion   MVP - Trae Young  DPOY - Clint Capela  6MOY - Lou Williams  MIP - Brandon Goodwin  COY - Nate McMillan  ROY - Onyeka Okongwu
I don’t care what the situation is. You don’t lose to a hawks team missing Trae Young and Clint Capela if you’re a playoff contender. Also give more minutes to Iggy putting up a goose egg than Tyler Herro.
You probably think Clint Capela &gt; Trae Young too. Keep wins shares watching casual
Longer answer: Clint N'Dumba Capela
"Yeah, Harden Ariza, Ryan Anderson legit 15ppg player, Eric Gordon, Lou Will mid season and most important Clint Capela had break out year and team had success also due to him and Harden both taking huge step forward. If you take player by player, there are already in this stack of players better and complementary players to Harden than in whole Okc team that year, Gordon&gt;Oladipo, Ryan Anderson&gt;Kanter or rookie Sabonis, Ariza&gt; any other guard/forward in Okc, and Okc has advantage in Adams, Lou&gt;any other guard. And on top of everything else BB reference had Houston  expected W/L : 55-27 , and 43-39 for Okc. Plus Westbrook was leading the league in clutch points(and had 25-15 in clutch games) 6.2 on 45% to Hardens 3.8 on 36% (21-18). And Advanced states except efficiency and WS(that is tied to efficiency) were almost all on Westbrooks like value over replacement. While Harden was worthy of an MVP, Westbrook was more worthy due to a fact that he had historical season."
Clint Capela
"Clint Capela terrifies me  Ofc the heat aren’t an easy matchup, no playoff team is, but I think people are majorly sleeping on the hawks"
"I don't think we win this game if Trae stays in. Hope he's alright - league can't really handle another injury.  Man, we miss Mitch badly. Clint Capela is so underrated."

CLiNt CaPeLa Is OnLy GoOd BeCaUsE oF hArDeN 🤪
I might get ripped for saying this but I believe Clint Capela is the most valuable player on the Atlanta Hawks.
Actual Nephews don't know who Clint Capela is
LOL. This is why KAT needs to leave that dumpster fire of a team. Because you have nephews thinking Clint Capela is better.
Yeah bro Clint fucking Capela was the reason why the Rockets were so good. Not the all time great point god or one of the best offensive players of all time.          That team would have been just as good with Javale McGee
Clint capela and John Collins would both easily be the second best player on the knicks
Imagine thinking Clint Capela is better than KAT.
injuries and toxic fans aside I never wanna see Clint Capela ever again  also bless Thibs for sticking with Quick and not going back to Payton  edit: hope Trae's alright too :|
Julius Randle is my religion.  And I do not want to face Clint Capela anymore.
Clint capela is such a fucking warrior man
Clint Capela elbow.
It's still a big part of his game and isn't going anywhere.   Just less need and opportunity to do so when you share the floor with KD and Kyrie instead of Eric Gordon and Clint Capela.
"You cant compare Kyrie, Harden, and KD to RJ Barrett. These guys have proven themselves, but let me ask u this. Are Clint Capela, Bogdan, Collins role players to you because the offense is built around Trae similarly how the Knicks offense is built around Randle."
I used to think Clint capela was African at first
"Look at Clint Capela man, so inspirational"
Clint Capela should be number two on this list.
"Imagine Harden playing with, idk, say... Clint Capela!"
The Rockets didn't get enough in that Clint Capela trade.

Clint Capela for center
"[I found this site that shows jump ball stats](https://www.otherbasketballstats.com/pages/jumpball/jumpball) and it's super interesting.  Out of players with 40+ attempts Andre Drummond has the best win% (.82) while Vucevic has the worst (.25).  What's also a little interesting is that the leaders for rebound% in the league are average-to-very-poor at winning jump balls:  Clint Capela - 1st in rebound %, wins .47 of jump balls  Enes Kanter - 2nd in rebound %, wins .28 of jump balls  Jonas Valančiūnas - 3rd in rebound %, wins .46 of jump balls"
Clint Capela should definitely be on this list.
He could be a good Big at some point but with Clint Capela dominant in his mid 20’s. They should’ve drafted Halliburton
This season Clint Capela is listed as the 6th best player in the NBA by RAPTOR. It's been 60 games
Clint Capela and Ryan Anderson
Did you watch the Hawks at all this season? Seriously.  Clint Capela might be the number one reason for the Hawks being in the 4th place right now.
"I just think the rebounding argument is a strange one because I’ve never ever heard this brought up as an argument between point guards before.   Like are we looking at harden versus Steph rebounding numbers? I’m willing to concede that if the rebounds luka gets are so important to team success as to make him the obviously better player that he would be, but it just seems kind of tenuous given their role on the court. Luka is taller and he doesn’t have Clint Capela so he gets a lot more boards."
"Advanced statistics absolutely back up him being one of the worst defenders in the league.   Even before Clint Capela, Trae was a piss poor rebounder. Big guards will always clean the boards well. Use your eye test here.   Ignoring that significant difference in the scoring efficiency proves the point. At this point, what does Trae do better than Luka?   You can be an incredible player and someone just simply be better. For example, KAT is an absolute freak and a dominant big man. Jokic is obviously better though. That’s nothing against KAT. He’s just not as good as Jokic."
"Nobody can guard Jokic, he's unstoppable.   The closest any single player has come to disrupting him ironically is Clint Capela."
"As if getting self made buckets off the dribble is all there is to basketball. This team was 20-47 last season because we didn’t have a center like Clint who could defend the paint against anyone AND grab the rebound off the miss almost every time. Literally, going from Damian Jones and Alex Len to Capela and a rookie has gotten us at least 8 extra wins. Trae is not worth that many wins himself. We would be where the Bulls are without him. Without Trae, we’d be hovering where the Hornets are. He’s actually been bad for most games this season"
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."

"Ah, so you never saw the great offensive scheme of Oladipo or Brogdon ISOing on the perimeter before bricking a shot, leaving everyone standing around the preimeter? Shame, it was a truly amazing offense.  Either it's McMillan having Trae fucking Young and Clint Capela as he did with Oladipo (pre-injury) and Sabonis, or he's really taken the time to learn offensive schemes. I'm really glad for him that the Hawks are the perfect team for him to raise the ground. It seems like his biggest weaknesses with us are positives for the Hawks."
A little more of a realistic guy opposed to AD/Giannis would probably be like Clint Capela
"I was devastated when Clint left Houston  He was one of my favorite guys on that team, and the Harden/Capela lob was UNSTOPPABLE (unless your name was Draymond Green)  So happy to see him finally getting real recognition w the hawks, truly"
"Neither was Theis. We didn’t slow either of those guys down lol. Bam went to work against us, but he’s a great player, he is significantly better than Clint Capela."
"That's a solid ranking, I'd argue the case for Clint Capela to be 6th due to his significant defensive impact but can't complain overall."
"I said at the beginning of the season if Clint Capela is healthy, y’all would have top 5 seed potential. Glad to see him making a difference after people kinda brushed off how important he was for the Rockets"
Clint Capela had himself a motherfucking game. Beastin' on the boards.
Shout out to the smooth brain who tried to tell me Nurkic was better than Capela LMAO. Clint puts up stats like this basically every game for us
"Clint capela not being an all star this year was a huge mistake, he is unbelievable"
Clint Capela is super underrated
Clint Capela had himself a motherfucking game. Beastin' on them boards.
"He never had a competent team around him since KD left. Apart from PG and Harden, his best teammates were Stiven Adams and Clint Capela. Hell, he didn’t have a competent team around him since like 2013, but KD/Russ were so good that it didn’t matter."
Holy fuck. Clint Capela is so underrated
"He can develop into a Clint Capela type of player, which wouldn't be too bad"
"ayton is not better than Clint Capela, so add that to the centers you mentioned. Hes nba leader in boards and should be in dpoy contention."
"Don't bother, the goober thinks that Clint Capela is a better center than Ayton.  That alone should tell you that he hasn't watched a single Suns game this year."
Fair enough but I think every fan base does this.   Just the other day there was a lakers thread in which people were acting like tht will be able to shoot 40% from three and 17ppg with just a bit of work.  Some Celtic fans talk about Robert Williams like he’s an elite big man. I saw one Celtic fan this season claiming Robert Williams gives them the same production as a Clint capela but cheaper.
Clint Capela
remember when you guys were intentionally losing games to avoid harden in the playoffs cuz he only needed clint capela to dominate Jokic with a simple PNR?
"&gt;You’re right, Jimmy only had a RAPTOR Rating of +8.1 and Towns had one of +3.8. Jimmy had a real plus/minus of 4.01 and Towns had one of 1.94.

Oh wait he didn't because KAT played all 82 games....   &gt;And it’s true that Towns got shut down in the first round by 18’ Clint Capela of all people  Yeah by a historically great team... who was one of the better defensive teams in the NBA...."

Any stat that says Clint Capela is a top 10 player and Poeltl and Caruso are top 20 players in the league is a stat you can disregard.
Nah the stupidest thing ive heard him say has got to be that Bam's ceiling is Clint Capela lol
"Wiggins is definitely fine. I think Barnes has the better BBIQ, but Wiggins blows him away in athleticism, he's younger, and he's adjusted to the Warriors system the best out of anyone we've brought in in anticipation for this season. He's a good fit.  Back when Houston traded Clint Capella, I was hoping we'd trade for him. Like you said, we don't need to hit a home run at the center position. And Capela is IMO a top 10 center rn.   Doubt Atlanta would trade him away now though. If GSW wanted him they really needed to go after him when Houston was offering."
Clint Capela MVP
Swiss knife Clint Capela. He basicaly plays on all nba/all defense level. At least throw his name sometimes in conversations about best bigs in the league
"I have been ringing this bell all season long, Clint Capela"
"If Haliburton can become like 2014-2016 Shaun Livingston but with a 3-point shot that's a really useful player (in terms of being disciplined, good defender, smart passer)  If Wiseman can be Clint Capela with a jumper in a few years I'll be pretty damn happy with that."

No it wasn’t. Paul is still a very good pg. Hes well out of his prime obviously but he could still be a very good floor general. Clint capela is balling out now just like in 2018. He had pj tucker still. That team was very good. It only seems that way now cause of how destroyed it was so quickly to accommodate Russell Westbrook’s deficiencies as a player.
john collins and clint capela
Rudy gobert and Clint capela are probably the two centers that dominate in the pick in roll

"Yah the guy they making chants about and the literal fucking mayor trash talked, yah that guy is living rent free. You acting like I said Clint capela is living rent free in your heads. It ain't even that serious I have no stake in this series"
Probably not statiscally but 6’1 180 isn’t that crazy at all. Looking at someone at that height is like looking at another regular guy. It’s not like it’s Clint capela or John Collins they talking shit to
Clint capela really ran around for 36 mins and didn’t do much lol.
Clint Capela’s team: *Has abysmal shooting night from 3 in the playoffs*  Clint Capela: “Hey I’ve seen this one before. It’s a classic!”
What shoes are Clint Capela wearing in this game. They look nice af
"Man, imagine if thise James Harden Rockets teams had a real big like Clint Capela? A dude who could rim run and rebound long 3s probably would've made them pretty good"
Hawks evolved their Dennis Schroder into Clint Capela to make the playoffs.
"i know what he was widely considered as- the awards speak to that. He was different than clint capela though. He got lit up in pick and rolls because he was like a statue coming out on high ball screens. As athletic as he was, he didn't use it to cover ground on perimeter players"
"Bro he was an elite defensive talent and was widely considered as such, not the rich man's Whiteside you're painting him as. He was like if Clint Capela gained 40 lbs of muscle. And this is coming from a longtime Clipper-hater."
Imagine if Andre Drummond accepted a role playing like Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert instead of a wanna be Al Jefferson
"Jokic seems to be the natural answer, but he’s got too much scoring on his team  Westbrook if he decides to chase rebounds. He’s only **2.8** rebounds behind Clint Capela who’s the league leader. If he doesn’t start slow, he could potentially lead in scoring too"
"Don't forget Clint Capela, the Swedish Mega-Schroeder."
"Read my other comment down the thread. You cannot copy and paste MPJ's numbers onto Trae's situation. One is there to punish defenses and generate secondary offense. The other is a prinary playmaker creating his own shot, often out of double teams.  The fact is still that taking a 3 + D scorer with no playmaking ability, even if he becomes the best 3 + D scorer in the league, is a shit decision for a top 5 pick. *You cannot build a team around MPJ*. That's the point. Everything that makes him great in Denver as the #2 guy does not exist on a lottery team. He can't pass so he'd get annihilated by double teams, he'd have to take people on isos/off dribble which he has not at all proven he can do, etc.  This is why there is always a ""bust"" or two in the top 3/4. You cannot settle, as a lottery team, for anything other than someone who has the potential to carry the offense of your team. Draft retrospectives are not just about ranking the skill of the players. Someone can be a draft bust but still be the right choice because the team just had to take a chance.  But we're not even talking about busts. We're talking about Trae Young turning the hawks from a lottery team to a playoff team vs MPJ getting great looks from Jokic playmaking. They are not the same situation, and playmaking/self-creation will always trump good defense as a franchise leader. There are always good defenders, e.g. Clint Capela, that you can get to your team. Elite playmakers are tougher. This is reductionist, but the top 15 APG leaders are all max players, whereas of the top 15 blocks leaders, only 3 are max contracts. Defense is easier to pay for than offense"
As someone who as recently as a month ago said “he’s never played with a real point guard! He can be Clint Capela with Luka!” I’m really grateful for these playoffs and hope we don’t touch him.
"The most appealing basketball, for me, is people like Myles Turner and Clint Capela. Violent paint defense and aggressive blocks."
"Just piggybacking off this. Just because AD isn’t always in the low post like an Embiid is, doesn’t mean his work is not done at the rim. Drummond just standing right in the paint all game hinders AD as a roller, cutter, lob threat, and reduces the risk of him driving to the hoop, then making him easier to defend in the mid post as well.  Other low post scorers in this league like JV, Nurk, Jokic, Embiid, Ayton can all step out and at least hit a midrange, so they don’t carry the same issue.   Those who can’t shoot, are athletic and mobile to the point where if you leave them at the midrange spot they just need one step to dunk it on you -like Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela etc.  Drummond is NOT a shooter at any spot. He is not too quick and doesn’t have a high vertical to compensate. AND is not even good in the low post. His touch around the rim is atrocious. He generally has shot under 50 percent despite shooting mainly at the rim."

Kinda weird he's be a fan of Clint Capela. Dude is just like 5 years older than him
"If anything Trae should take as an ego boost. They're saying his name because he's the biggest threat on the team.  They ain't saying ""fuck Clint Capela"""
His favorite player is Lou Williams or Clint Capela?
"if not for derrick rose and taj, clint capela would have the most playoff experience in this series from all his runs with harden"
"Trae Young is gonna score 50 points, Clint Capela will get 30 rebounds, Tony Snell will get 8 three pointers in a row, today is gonna be great."
Want the Hawks to win solely because of Rockets legend Clint Capela.
Only 33 ever: https://ca.nba.com/news/clint-capela-atlanta-hawks-centre-joins-history-in-consecutive-games-with-monster-stat-lines/1jef0dbsgawyp1k7ix7cevzlc2
"Nikola Jokic   Joel Embiid   Rudy Gobert   KAT   Clint Capela   Nikola Vucevic   Bam Adebayo   Myles Turner    I think he’s around top 10, I guess depending on how you classify some guys like AD, Wood, etc.  Are there any obvious centers I’m missing who you rate over Nurk?"
"Nuggets tanked to get the Blazers second round and duck Clint Capela, lost that too. Both were the right call even if the Clippers lose the series."
He’s not perfect in the same way that Clint Capela has no offensive touch and can’t shoot worth a shit but he’s been integral to the hawks team is my point.  Like you gotta gas your dudes up if they’re doing their roll well. They lose today without him
1. Dominique Wilkins 2. Dikembe Mutombo 3. Greivis Vasquez (Maryland fan) 4. Paul Millsap 5. Shawn Kemp 6. Clint Capela 7. Trae Young 8. Ben Wallace 9. Dennis Rodman 10. Derrick Rose
"You'd be leaving the entire floor open to drives from RJ, Barrett, and Quickley. Not even mentioning sucking up extra defenders inside to make up for capela's absence would give shooters like bullock opportunities from the corners.   Trae guarding the knicks PG's with no real defensive presence behind him (collins isn't terrible but he certainly isn't capela) seems like a recipe for disaster imo. In addition, anyone guarding randle is at the highest risk of picking up fouls, so you run the risk of clint getting into trouble since he may be more prone to fall for jumpshot fakes, which randle utilizes quite well."
"Collins is not a great defender. Why would the hawks have capela on randle? His strengths are rim protection. You'd be nullifying that by having randle stay out on the perimeter in man to man.  If you decide to double randle bc he's quicker than clint, then you open up the entire floor without your best shot blocker to protect the paint. RJ and rose would also have a much easier time driving inside."
The nets would straight up be better trading Kyrie for Clint Capela or Myles Turner. I’d be very skeptical of that ever happening though.
I love the framing of this tween. It’s as if Bam not being a finalist was a bigger miss than Clint capela not being a finalist.   Clint’s defense was mutumbo level good this season but no one outside of hawks viewers know that.
Yeah but I'm talking about Worse Clint Capela 1.0 bro.
Well Clint Capela is Clint Capela 1.0 bro
"Yes,yes I know he said Allen is ""Worse Clint Capela 2.0"". I'm asking who then is Worse Clint Capela **1.0**"
"Through 46 games in the middle of 18/19, Harden averaged 39/8/7 on 62.2% TS. In this period, Clint Capela missed 15 games, Chris Paul missed 21, Gordon 10 and Danuel House 18. The only serviceable players healthy in this period were Austin Rivers, PJ Tucker, Gerald Green &amp; Nene Hilario, the remainder were 3rd stringers and G-Leaguers. The Rockets were 29-17.  He's more or less proven he can carry G-Leaguers to a playoff win-rate."
2019 harden   • more 40 point games than the rest of the league combined •more 60 point games than the rest of the league combined (2 were triple doubles)  • 2 61 point games  • 30+ points for 32 straight games  •CP3 missed 24 games  •Clint Capela missed 15 games  •4th seed in the west   How can you read this and not take harden lmao
"im far more terrified of Capela and Bogi in a 7 game series than Trae tbh  obv Trae is their best player, and his game is much more than foul baiting, but Clint and Bogi are the guys that have put them into a position to win against us. Especially Clint, he had fucking TWENTY-TWO rebounds our last match. if we don’t shut those guys down we might as well just pack our bags early"
Capela is 100% worth it and has proven this season to have separated himself from those similar type players. The difference from Alex Len and Damian Jones to Clint Capela is night and day and the biggest reason the Hawks started winning.
I’m honestly not sure. I really wish he looked better as a starter with us. He’s kinda been a potential guy for quite some time. Maybe he could be like Clint capela?
Who is Worse Clint Capela 1.0?
Still upset that Clint Capela outplayed both KAT and Gobert only to get erased by Looney
"Allen's ceiling seems to be Clint Capela and he's not there quite yet so his statement is harsh but accurate. However, in terms of predicting which players will be stars in the future I can think of a handful of other fanbases who are worse. For starters, I'd like to know your original thoughts about Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram and your current thoughts on Talen Horton-Tucker."
Imagine trading a potential star in sexton because of Worse Clint Capela 2.0
"Because he was dealing with injuries/just not playing well, not because of Clint Capela.  He averaged 32 on 52.6% shooting in the entire month of games before Capela got injured. So yes, he could operate him with lmfao."
"I agree. Jump shots are very pretty. In the 90's when it was all post-ups, it was ugly, but now that it's all 3's, it's monotonous. The Rockets trading Clint Capela to add more 3&amp;D guys and just run a 6'5"" dude at center was gross. It's got to be possible to get a balance of the two."
"No way Onyeka drops that far, dude’s had injuries and plays the same position as Clint Capela, he still has the same upside"
"I once made a post about how I’d rather have Nerlens Noel then Clint Capela.   One of them embraced their role and flourished, the other took another few years and is just now becoming playable again.   I was left looking like an idiot."
"Also centers have such a wide range, jokic and embiid’s shot selections are nowhere similar to a Clint capela or deandre Jordan."
"Honestly, it took me a while to figure out what you were saying and not because of poor phrasing on your part.  I believe that you're saying that Danilo Gallinari, De'Andre Hunter, Clint Capela should be listed along with Carmelo Anthony and the rest of that group, but the ""third best on their team"" would be either John Collins or Bogdan Bogdanovic."
"Magic is just ben simmons with aids, MJ wouldn’t survive in today’s NBA without a consistent three, lebron is lebron, duncan is an unathletic clint capela, and KAJ played with cocaine addicts"
"&gt;Most prolific alley-oop duo (credit to lactardenthusiast for the idea)  &gt;**Clint Capela &amp; Trae Young (69)**  &gt;Mike Conley &amp; Rudy Gobert (39)  &gt;DeAndre Jordan &amp; James Harden, **John Collins &amp; Trae Young (32)**  &gt;Deandre Ayton &amp; Devin Booker (31)  Damn!

&gt; any stat that has deandre ayton and clint capela over luka doncic can't have much merit behind it  Like rebounds per game and FG%?

Good luck in the playoffs Hawks. Rooting for Clint Capela for sure.  Been a shitty season for Rockets basketball. IIRC we were 11 - 10 before we ripped off 20 losses in a row. Hope we end up with a top 4 pick or it was all for nothing.
"your 3 best players, trae young, john collins, and clint capela all played 62-63 games 10 more than jimmy butler. but ok. i mean if my team had their 3 best players for 87% of the season i wouldn’t act like my teams other injuries were so impactful"
Young Clint Capela was still 5x better than Sabonis  And Grant’s only skill that year was dunking and defending
"Neither which is the problem lol. I think a big man going 1st gets everyone's mind on Hakeem, Duncan, Shaq etc. Imo his ceiling is somewhere between David Robinson, Aldridge, Marc Gasol, and KG, so best case I think he's still a tier below the top top guys. His floor is probably Clint Capela with a midrange jumper.   There's a huuuuuge range of outcomes in between there, he's probably one of the hardest players to project for the next 5 years and you can find evidence to support the positive and negative sides"
"Lou will was a late season addition and played like absolute garbage. Young Clint capela, sure. Meanwhile the thunder had jerami grant, oladipo,  and sabonis"
"How do you use Giannis correctly? He’s the most unskilled player on the court. If he wasn’t 6’11 he wouldn’t even be in the nba. He can’t post up, struggles finishing vs rim protection in the playoffs, can’t shoot free throws, can’t shoot the three, can’t shoot midrange, just barely an average passer, below average handles…. What does he do well on offense other than dunk?  He’s tricked everyone into thinking he’s some sort of generational player but he’s just an athletic clint capela :/"
on title winning team he is a lob threat and paint anchor surrounded by elite playmakers.     basically he's the french clint capela
"Clint Capela with that -25, yuck."
But I was told he was worse than Clint Capela
John Collins and Clint Capela don't exist?
Imagine getting punked by Clint Capela and Kevin Huerters bitch asses. Sixers better watch out or it's hawks in 6.
"I love seeing Clint Capela and Lou Williams. I am a Rockets fan, so...they are my people."
Clint Capela and Dennis Schroeder tag team and feed you schnitzel wieners until you blow up
We have an MVP caliber player that lost to a two-time MVP finals player.   You have scrubs and the anointed Knicks savior and most improved player and still lost to fucking Trae Young and Clint Capela .   🤣
"The Suns would be a title favourite. In this hypothetical, the Suns use their resources to get a center instead of CP3. No Ayton slander but center, in general, is the easiest position to fill in NBA. Clint Capela was gettable. Myles Turner. Ibaka. Steven Adams. Derrick Favours. Christian Wood. Valanciunas.  Even lower-tier centers like Mason Plumlee would probably be fine on this team, and use those resources to get another wing or playmaker.  I think you can find someone that does 50-75% of what Ayton does fairly easily for his role on this team.  I think you have to look at it from the perspective that they used resources on CP3 because the team needed a lead ballhandler and more permitter scoring and playmaking. Luka is still on his rookie deal so those resources can be used in a lot of different places.  And, of course, there is the obvious. Luka is a significantly better player than Ayton. Anyone who says Ayton is really overthinking it. Luka is on his way to his second first All-NBA team. If I had to bet right now. I would take the under on Ayton ever making a first All-NBA team. That doesn't mean he's bad, but barring a big jump he is significantly below AD, Jokic, Embiid and Gobert in the second tier with Capela and Bam."
theoretically if we drafted luka we probably take Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd round that year and try to sign Clint capela. so we would be pretty good either way
"People have (rightfully) been giving capela credit for anchoring the atlanta defense, but ayton is better than even clint i feel at holding it down in the paint. He fucked up jokic today, almost completely neutralized him. Great showing from him in the whole playoffs so far."
WOAT free throw shooting team         Pg: Luka         Sg: Ben Simmons         Sf: Lebron         Pf: Giannis          C: Clint Capela
"Mavs don’t need KP, they need PJ Tucker and Clint Capela types.   Their front office made a mistake. Probably should try to correct it this season instead of stringing it along."
"Nate was never a bad coach by any means. In fact, I don't think any Pacers fan wish him ill-will. He did a ton for getting our rosters into the playoffs which is exactly what the Pacers FO wanted in the first place.  Atlanta's roster is much better constructed than the Pacers and the combination of Trae Young (an actual star, something the Pacers haven't had) and Clint Capela is the perfect duo for the style of basketball that Nate wants to run.  That being said, you still need to acknowledge that in a decade and a half of being a head coach Nate has only won two playoff series and the most recent win was against an overperforming Knicks team without a true star.   But still, gotta give Nate credit for taking us to the playoffs. I was saying all last season that our ceiling was a 3rd seed and there's still part of me that believes that we have enough collective talent to get to the second round (similar to a manner that the Hawks did this playoff run). But, we ended up looking a lot like the same Orlando team that decided to blow it up finally.  I have no idea what to do with our team moving forward. Firing Nate can be the right decision just as much as hiring Bjork was the wrong one. Part of me wonders what we'd look like if we had gone with Chris Finch instead."
"Clint Capela has been a massive addition to the Hawks. His rebpunding presence allows for all the spacing for their shooters to operate, plus he's a legitimate rim runner/defender."
"&gt;But a 7’0 guy running through a bunch of 6’7 white dudes through the 70’s era doesn’t seem too impressive.   .....  &gt; If Kareem was in the league right now, he would be like a glorified Clint Capela, especially with people guarding him that are actually his size.  Glorified Clint Capela? What the fuck."
Glorified Clint Capela hot damn thats a shitty take.
"&gt; A Clint Capela type would be ideal.  There really aren't many Clints in the league, he's very good at what he does."
"Ball dominant off-guard, three shooters, and Clint Capela?   That would never work."

You honestly don’t even need a pick and pop center if you have another 3 shooters next to Luka.   A Clint Capela type would be ideal.   Powell had great chemistry before tearing his Achilles.

"It it a nice start but there was one case when Embiid went by Capela like a  cone got the board and made the basket and then hacking can get a bit dangerous, I don't get how Embiid overpowered Capela so easy, Clint has to try to do better and don't let him get offensive boards."
"Hawks FO sabotaged the he'll out of the team in Trae's sophomore year to make sure they could get more help on the right timeline. You moved decent players like Tauren Prince for a pick, let go of useful vets like Len and Dedmon who was really good in Trae's first season and rolled out guys like Chandler Parsons, Jabari Parker, Evan Turner, Jeff Teague and the corpse of Vince Carter and that landed you Deandre Hunter who's a perfect fit and on the right timeline. Okwongu was also a result of it this season even if he's a work in progress. Patience and cap space meant you got Clint Capela for pennies, the Trae trade got you Cam Reddish and all those salary dumps absorbed gave you space for the offseason signings. There's intentionality and patience in the Hawks strategy even if there's been one or two misses along the way even if it looks like luck from the outside."
"I’m talking about offense. I already know he is an amazing defender. What more can he do than Clint Capela on offense? The Clippers only have to worry about getting defensive rebounds, making Mitchell work for every shot and contesting/limiting 3s. The Clippers are the best 3pt shooting team in the league. If they 5 out Gobert will not provide any extra benefit 30 feet from the basket. That’s how the Warriors killed him the last time they played."
Yes. Conley is his second best option. Clarkson was cooking off the bench but he’s cooled down somewhat. Bojan is a great shooter also. Gobert is like a better Clint Capela. Royce O Neal is going to have his hands full with Kawhi and PG. I’m not sure if Joe Ingles can contain Kawhi. If the Clippers decide to go small or run Ibaka I think they can go 5 out and run Gobert off the floor and that will give the Jazz serious problems since he’s they’re defensive anchor.
"The ideal players the Mavs need to be looking for right now are slashers who can get to the rim at will and a rim protector/rim runner who excels in the PnR. Obviously these guys aren't available but maybe something like Michael Porter and Clint Capela. Mavs need fewer jump shooters just standing in the corner, they gotta diversify their offense. You could get 2 elite players like I described for the same price as 1 Dame, and I think that would be a better fit."
Start of 3rd quarter:  Clint Capela barrelling into Seth Curry that should've been an offensive foul and his 4th which would've took him out of the game? Then Simmons gets called for 2 soft ones at half court and the sixers had to put Danny Green back on Trae Young.  Refs whistled everything in the 1st half and then decided not to call anything in the 4th quarter.
That ending was horrifyingly close. I love Atlanta hawks basketball. I love Trae Young. I love John Collins. I love Bogi Bogdanovic. I love Clint Capela. I love Kevin Hurter.
Clint Capela has experience though. I'm a Rockets fan rooting for his success.
"NO  &amp;#x200B;  It's Trae Young, Clint Capela, and a bunch of role players"
Clint ‘older brother of Schröder’ Capela
Clint Capela on the Mavericks would be so good. Basically the exact type of player they need this series
where is clint capela?
"Still can’t believe Trae young isn’t an all star this year, still can’t believe Clint Capela isn’t on any all nba this year"
"Clint Capela is better than anybody on the Mavs not named Luka. Based on the recent quality of play by KP, there's also an argument to be made that Collins and Bogdan are too."
"That’s a valid point.  If a team loses, it’s never just what they did wrong or what they other did right. It’s always a mix of both. It’s just like when people talk shot about Randle. They say he shot terribly from the field like it was some mystery that he just forgot how to shoot, but then conveniently ignore that Clint Capela has a history of royally fucking up dudes’ shooting percentages up in the playoffs. It’s very rare that a player who is normally so consistent, like Middleton, to just shoot like garbage for no reason at all."
Clint Capela
"Ignore the flair.  The Sonics are my team.  But I bought a league pass for the Hawks this year *just* to watch Clint Capela.  I grew up watching guys like Hakeem and Dikembe, and Capela is one of the few guys (Gobert being another, but I’ll die before I root for the Jazz) who reminds me of them.  But he’s the only one who *also* reminds me of Rodman; a glue guy that doesn’t need glory to completely change a team.  Joker is amazing at the 5, Embiid is a powerhouse, and Ayton’s gonna be a force.  Won’t call him the best center in the league; but something about Capela fascinates me.  I could watch that dude play all day."
Clint Capela  PJ Tucker  James Harden  Lou Williams  Chris Paul   in reverse order of position
"Oh I agree regarding Stotts. His offense was laughably basic. And you’re right about those guys but those teams had super athletic screen setters/roll men and one of the best passers ever in Harden.   And besides, the high pick is the basis of nearly all modern offense. Jones isn’t setting effective screens so he can’t be in that role and back door lobs are trick plays or side dishes, not substantive parts of an offense. I should have been more specific when I mentioned lobs but DJJ is obviously not deandre Jordan or Clint capela lol"
Hawks in 6 imo. Without Embiid clint capela and john collins can work. The best hope the 6ers have is pray that ben simmons locks down trae
Clint capela was the hawks mvp
"Seconded on Clint Capela. Makes me downright salty that the Mavs didn’t pull the trigger on making that trade with Houston. Capela in the paint would have elevated the Mavs to serious contender status instead of very good dark horse IMO, esp with the way he’s been playing for the Hawks, and also the issues the Mavs have been having in the paint this series against the Clippers"
"I can’t name one, but I’ve got a list: Clint Capela John Collins Goran Dragic Jusuf Nurkic Mikal Bridges Miles Bridges Garrison Matthews"
I also remember a certain someone also saying that Clint Capela was an overpaid bad player and that the Hawks would miss the playoffs.  I wonder who that someone is...
"I'll be happy to answer some questions for you!  &gt;Like, are we SURE the Hawks are good? All we hear is Trae young this Trae young that, but......  ** The Hawks have one of the best records in basketball since Nate took over, i believe its the best record in the East. They have a lot of players that can handle the ball and make threes, as well as a few great defensive players which is a big reason why the Hawks had the best 4th quarter +/- once Nate took over.  &gt;We hear about all this talent, better team, blah blah blah.  ** Correct, now we do. Before the playoffs 16 ESPN analyst went 14-2 for the Knicks winning the series. That was the general perception in the media, Hawks losing in 6. Almost nobody in the media watches our team and when they do they finally see that we actually have a lot of depth and a PG capable of being a superstar in this league.  &gt;Clint Capela? Always outplayed in big games with Houston. The same guy that shrunk against the Warriors is Now apparently Young’s perfect PNR sidekick  ** He's 26 and Harden also got outplayed in big games in Houston. You can say that about a lot of Rockets. Hes been a top 3 rim protector in the league this year and an elite lob threat and rebounder.  &gt;Nate McMillian? Never won in the playoffs with Indiana and Portland  ** Do you know how many series they were actually favored? How many times he got fucked by injury, or LeBron, or Kobe? He didn't win a lot but there's really only 1 or 2 series that he probably should've won but didn't. That's not terrible, and he's also obviously adjusted his coaching style some bc a lot of his criticisms centered around his rotations but its clear hes been more willing to make changes. Your team doesn't have the best 4th quarter +/- if your rotations are shit and the players don't like you so he must be doing something right.  &gt;Bogdan? The guy who put up empty stats on the nets/kings. And BTW That MIL tampering think was bullshit. He should be a Buck  ** Hey you're probably right about one thing, he should be a Buck. But he's not. He has a bigger role in Atlanta than he would in MIL and Nate has Bogi playing the best ball (statistically) of his career. He also had some huge buckets this series against the Knicks and all season for us so I don't think any Hawks fan or player would consider those empty stats.   &gt;John Collins? The guy with that awful dunk contest  ** I will not tolerate this JC slander. There's a reason hes got the nickname ""the Baptist"", plus his initials are the same as the big man himself, James Cameron.  &gt;The Knicks, with a possible COY and MIP and defense and those crowds lose to........  A team that basically quit on Lloyd Pierce  ** LP alienated himself from his players to the media by failing to take accountability and having his players backs on a regular basis. If you lose a locker room in 2 years, and vets as well as rookies can't stand you then you're probably fucking up as a coach. Hes not Popovich, he hasn't won shit and obviously doesn't command the type of respect needed to coach the way he tried to coach. We had lost 11 games this year despite having a double digit lead in the 4th quarter, most of those due to LP's rotations. Hes not a good coach my guy.  And yes you lost to the better team. We have a better coach imo, undeniably more depth and talent, the best player on the court (we had less FT's btw too I'm just saying), a better defensive game plan for disrupting your initiator on offense, a better rim protector, better shooting (yes I know the Knicks had a higher 3pt % but we have more guys that can make that shot which opens up the floor more), and we out rebounded the Knicks and had less TO's.   Does this help?"
bro you got an amazing travel agent in clint capela just relax
"Reducing Clint Capela, an elite defender and top 3 rim protector, to only his offense is stupid. Describing John Collins, one of the best off ball bigs in the league, as the dude with the awful dunk contest is stupid. You didnt even touch on our bench? You didnt co textualize the teams that Nate was coaching? Ugh i usually dont get mad about this type of stuff, but what hawks team were you watching bruh"
I ain't feeling pre-Mega Evolution Clint Capela on the Bulls tbh
Patrick Ewing without a doubt. No coach today is gonna post him up a million times a game because there’s just better offensive sets that get run. 50% from the field as a center is just not good enough in today’s game if that doesn’t include any 3s. His defense would also take a hit with today’s rules and modern spacing. Imo he’d basically be Clint Capela.
"lmao crazy cus the knicks didnt beat miami at all this year. and whats more embarrassing, getting swept by a 2 time mvp and title contending team, or losing in 5 to trae young and clint capela"
Bro I'm saying. He was projected to be a project center in the mold of Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert with the future of a jump shot. I honestly don't know what a lot of people were expecting out of him. Especially considering he's been backing up Vuc.
"Start Beal, Bench Booker, Cut LaVine  ...  Clint Capela, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton"
You could use him as little spoon and Clint Capela as big spoon.
"Gobert. He needs a partner that can contribute off ball and he would solve the Mavs defensive issues instantly. Imagine Luka Gobert PnR alley oops all day and he would have wide open shots from Gobert screens.  Failing that I would say Clint Capela, or any other great rebounder/defensive anchor."
I’m amazed that Clint Capela was able to go on the record and for it not to blow up in his face. That speaks volumes for the attitude and energy that Atlanta has assembled and are able to back up words with action. Could create an interesting situation when they meet Philadelphia
"Trae always gets his against the Sixers, but they survived Beal doing the same thing. They'll probably alternate between Green early in games then Thybulle and Simmons late. The real problem however is gonna be Clint Capela"
&gt;You can get a guy who is straight up better than Ayton in Clint Capela   According to who?
"&gt; Ayton seems like a no-brainer  Unpopular opinon: Ayton isnt' worth a max deal. Not anything particular against Ayton himself, but Centers just aren't that valuable or unique unless they're MVP caliber guys. You can get a guy who gives you 70% of Aytons production on both ends, for like $10m. You can get a guy who is straight up better than Ayton in Clint Capela for $18m. Centers can't affect the game to the degree that primary ball handlers can.   Paying Ayton 33m is just a bad move."
"The Knicks were a paper-thin team in the regular season who thrived because they had a great defensive coach (and defense is one things that EVERY player can do when they try) and they played in the east.   They lost this series because they weren't able to play that same level of defense across the board.   They did a fine job defending Capela and Collins, even Bogdan, but came at the expense of Trae dropped 30+ on them on the road three times.   I don't think it's a 'dreadful' series for Randle: The Hawks didn't have a lot of guys to defend.   Randle is playing in the post.  Who else do the Knicks have there to have to pay attention to?   Their other leading scorers (none of whom are averaging much more than the mid-teens) are all back court/wing guys.   The Hawks can double Randle a lot and get away with it.   I mean... first of all, the Hawks got Clint Capela. That dude is a phenomenal defender.   And he's got John Collins to help out with double, who is no slouch himself.   And it's not like the Hawks don't have other guys to help with doubles. They have a few solid defenders.  I don't see this as a failure at all for Randle. Just a wake up call for the Knicks that they need more offensive players and that they can't get by on defense alone."
"His shot only looked normal in Game 4 and 5. Clint Capela just sat in the paint and the Hawks took away his baseline jumper. The Knicks just simply didn't have the personnel to takedown the Hawks. I don't think Taj Gibson even started on the Thib's Bulls. Without Drose on the bench, our bench became Burks, Noel, and two rookies. Our team just isn't good enough."

(Woj) Hawks C. Clint Capela has been found in violation of league policies regarding Rare Candy and has been suspended indefinitely
"No, I just don't like being harassed by someone over the course of two months. You are a weirdo for A) remembering this and B) replying to a dead thread.  I don't care what you think about my ""take"". I've actively told you to quit it because things in life are bigger than someone practically stalking me over sports.  Nate doing well with the Hawks =/ the Pacers and Trailblazers fanbases both being wrong. Trae Young and Clint Capela are great on pick and rolls. You clearly don't watch the Pacers and just look at the stats.  Firing him was the right decision. He just didn't fit with our system and core."
"Bad rotations, no changes or adjustments, ISO hero ball offense, pick and rolls, failed to deal with double teams, no inbound plays, lost the locker room, outcoached in the playoffs, no 3s, no free throws, too many long 2s, slow pace, didn't involve Turner at all. In general, we just didn't have an offense.  It is possible for someone to improve and reflect on mistakes. He is a good defensive coach, he's always been a defensive guy.  Also, Trae Young and Clint Capela are his perfect monster pick and roll players. Trae Young deserves to be called a superstar, even if he needs to shave his head. I've always liked Capela and felt like he never got credit."
"Jesus dude you're a freak for still remembering this. Like, get a fucking life. It's been a month.  I'm happy for Nate, I'll always back our old coaches and players. Trae Young and Clint Capela are monsters and work perfectly for his system.  Firing him was still the right decision, he didn't work well for our core. Losing Dan Burke was worse for us."
It isn’t. People aren’t putting enough weight in the fact that he has led the playoffs in assists up to this point and averaged more offensive rebounds per game than Clint Capela.
"Trae Young and Clint Capela are his perfect players for that pick and roll offense.  Hawks fans, how did Trae do when the offense turned to ISO? I'd imagine he excelled at that too."
"Ah yes, one good player. It's not like Clint Capela wasn't an absolutely dominant center this year, John Collins showing that he can play well with Trae, and the multiple young and talented players like Hunter or Huerter. Delete this stupid comment."
Good thing Clint Capela is a travel agent and good these scrubs a great all inclusive package in Cancun!

"Clint Capela doing his best ""moms coming, act like you're asleep"" bit after he realizes Giannis is hurt."
"Clint Capela yelled, “There you go!” Nate Mcmillan gave a look of pleasant surprise red velvet belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Lou Williams hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Trae Young hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Clint Capela just standing around
"I mean Julius did shoot near 40% from three and he's better at everything else. If we are talking playoff Gulius then yeah obv I don't want him but that's a 2nd team all NBA player were talking about I think. Most countries aren't gonna have a John Collins Clint Capela DeAndre Hunter rotation guarding him, I think he would be better. I don't think it's a choice based on race I think it's based off of name recognition but either way I'd rather have Randle."
I don't understand how the Bucks are allowed to start Clint Capela and just put him in a #34 jersey.

"I think Jalen Green has a higher ceiling because it's a guard/wing dominant league, but Mobley is the ""safer"" pick. At worst he can be a defensive anchor at the rim who is also capable of switching onto some guards the perimeter. Even as a USC fan, I'm not totally sold on him as being a top offensive option, but defensively he will be elite. Like a Rudy Gobert/Clint Capela"

"Trae’s a better defender this season than last season but he still isn’t good at it nor will he ever be due to his size. He has good defensive metrics vs the Knicks, and was a slight negative vs the 76ers because we could hide him on players who couldn’t create.   I think definite scheme and team defense is normally more important than 1 on 1 defense, 1 on 1 defense will only cost a team if there are multiple players who are bad at it. Unfortunately, the hawks roster is a collection of bad defenders and Clint capela. (Hunter, reddish and Huerter are good defenders but 2 of them are hurt).   The hawks hide trae on Reggie bullock, Kortmaz, and PJ Tucker. It works for the most part. The problem is that Bogi, Collins, Lou, and Gallo are all god awful defenders and Middleton hunted Bogi in the 4th while McMillan had Huerter or best perimeter defender available on the sideline."

"&gt;Giannis has already basically matched Shaq's best scoring season  there are more possessions in today's game and more pussy ass foul calls  Shaq would be avg. 40pts in today's game  Shaq battled against Hakeem / David Robinson / Ewing / Prime Time Duncan  Giannis playing against Clint Capela  Shaq would eat Giannis for breakfast,  lunch and dinner"
What's up with Clint Capela?
John Collins and Clint capela don’t go inside? You don’t know basketball fr and saying that to others don’t change anything lmao virgin
Clint Capela! Pancake Man!
DID CLINT CAPELA REALLY JUST
Clint Capela is actually a beast. Still cannot believe the rockets traded him away in favor of LESS SIZE
Clint Capela Scouting Report:  -Is tall
Clint Capela is a late 90s big man. He lives off of table scraps and outsprinting guys in transition. None of that works in the playoffs.
Lol bucks have shot 15 free throws while Clint capela has shot all 4 of the hawks free throws. Shut up
"Ben Simmons and Clint Capela at the line, they need to make 2 free throws in a row to save your life. Which one do you go with?"
I’d rather watch Giannis take 20 free throws before having to see Clint Capela flick another one up. That was painful to watch
"He ain’t a star. Don’t get me wrong he’s good but he’s like a better Clint Capela. He’s a roll man who can knockdown the middy from time to time, superb defense though"
"JC is supposed to be that guy that'll be #2 for us, but the beauty of this hawks team is we have plenty of players (Lou Williams, Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter) in our lineup that can heat up and be the #2 on any night.  The game will really be fought and won in the back court though, jrue and Khris is a nice duo and we gotta be ready to answer them if they start going off"
"&gt;Ayton is 2nd in the 2021 playoffs in Win Shares and plays well on both sides of the ball. KAT has only made the playoffs once, when Jimmy Butler led the Timberwolves to the playoffs, and the one time we saw him in a playoff situation he got dominated by Clint Capela.   ""both sides of the ball"", I mean if you gave KAT open lobs every possession shit he'd play good too 🤣  And yeah KAT being all NBA that season had no impact on the making the playoffs?  &gt;and the one time we saw him in a playoff situation he got dominated by Clint Capela.   Have you ever checked what Jimmy Butler averaged that playoffs?  &gt;It’s just really unfair to even try comparing WindNo players like Ayton to regular season players like KAT.  Delusional."

"Stat wise? I cop that Trae shot and scored better but you can’t even compare rebounds. Russ had 11.5 to Trae’s 3.9. Russ also averaged 11.7 assists (assist to turnover +6.9) to Trae’s 9.4 (assist to turnover +5.4). If shooting is all that you measure a player by then we aren’t even having the same conversation.   Team wise? The Wizards were ravaged by Covid to where they couldn’t practice, have team meetings or team workouts. Their starting center was hurt for the year. And outside Beal and Westbrook they really don’t have much of a supporting cast. Are you really gonna compte Bertans and Hachimura to Collins and Galinari? Sure Robin Lopez hit a lot of hook shots but Clint Capela averaged 14.3 rebounds this season.   The Hawks were a better team than the Wizards."
Clint Capela (Switzerland)
"It’s not wrong. Westbrook struggled with a more clogged paint near the beginning of the season. They made the trade specifically to get him going.   [Through the first couple months of the season, it almost seemed like the Rockets were winning in spite of Westbrook. Harden was posting absurd scoring numbers, while Russ continued to clank threes from the outside, the duo producing a partnership that was statistically worse than what Harden and Paul did the previous couple seasons. While Westbrook obviously deserves the most credit for his new style of play, Daryl Morey was smart in realizing the team’s current setup wasn’t the best way to get the most out of his two superstars. The Capela trade wasn’t only about Houston wanting to shoot even more threes or trolling people who hate the way the Rockets play, it was about giving Harden and especially Westbrook even more room to showcase their talents.](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/02/27/russell-westbrook-rockets-small-ball-clint-capela-trade)  [This article](https://ca.nba.com/news/stat-just-happened-the-houston-rockets-have-unleashed-russell-westbrook-in-a-terrifying-way/14g2mlhh9upc61mrl3015dvxek) goes into more detail on Westbrook’s numbers before and after the trade.   To their credit, it kinda worked. Westbrook was a completely different player working with all that space. But it came at the cost of rim protection."
"&gt;You clearly think the other 29 teams are just farm teams for the Lakers.  No i dont, I actually hate the Lakers, I just understand that teams want picks every year especially one that is 22 in a deep draft again with the bad faith. Clint Capela went for a 17 pick.   You are probably right that I thought too rashly about the Spurs end of the deal, but Kuz on 13m isn't any worse than Hield on 23m. Yes Hield is better in a vacuum, but he's compensated more and is 2 years older which makes it proportionally equal. It's not a bad deal for Sacramento at all considering Pick 22 is the most valuable thing in the equation, and they get more value by playing Haliburton as a starter  If you dont think Hield is a negative asset then clearly we're never going to agree"

"Except Bogi is playing? Don’t matter if he’s playing through injury, he is still playing. Can’t say Hawks are playing without their 3rd best player when they literally are. Also, what about John Collins and Clint Capela?"
Clint Capela looks like Dennis Schröder after a few cycles
"Jrue Holiday did exactly what he should have done in Game 1; full court press Trae the entire game.   Giannis did exactly what he should have done in Game 1; pounded the paint. Clint Capela can’t stop him and the Hawks don’t have the bodies to build a wall. Even if they did collapse, Giannis can dish out backward to Khris or Jrue or Lopez or Patty Con or Bobby Buckets and make it happen."
Clint Capela has played the entire game and he has 2 points. For the whole game. Jesus.
"Awww yeah, love it when Giannis put the moves on Solomon hill and Clint capela 😎"
"&gt;I agree paying Allen reduces his value but I have no idea what his contact demands even are.  With the current market I dont think there's any way he doesnt get at least 20m/year. Clint Capela was traded for pick 17, and he made less than that at the time. Serge Ibaka was traded for TRoss and pick 25 and Ibaka back in 2017 was considered much better than Jarrett Allen"
Oh so players with high usage rate huh? Ye lets compare them to fucking clint capela
"I get you can't leave Lopez out there because Trae can cook him. But if you're the Bucks you don't want Giannis to have to compete with John Collins, who got 5 offensive boards last night, and the best rebounder in the NBA in Clint Capela for boards all night. Giannis is going to get worn down if he has to carry too much of the load offensively and defensively.  I don't know the Bucks roster, but it just isn't as simple as taking Lopez out of the starting lineup. That's all I'm trying to say."
How does it not mean Kevin walks.  Go look at the books.  John's defense is limited because he's too small to be a true center and too slow laterally to play a four all of the time.  Especially vs small ball.  He's being covered up by Capela.  And he's not even guarding the best front court player.  That's Clint.  If you haven't noticed.  John's a good help defender.  On ball is average.  And he's not a 20/10 guy on a playoff team.  Maybe go look at his stats.
"I am not sure what exactly you mean. But mudiay was born in DRC, so he's not second generation African. second generation implies only your grand parent was born there. 1st would be your parent. If yourself are born somewhere else you would be a immigrant yourself.  Frank ntlinkina is french via Rwanda, Clint capela is swiss via DRC/Angola, Schroeder is German via Gabon."
"Exactly. I remember there being some ""debate"" about Trae hunting assists, mostly because he motioned at Bogdanovic to shoot after he passed up an open shot earlier in the season. I mean it was clear as day he wanted him to shoot because he's open , but people will try to prove their narrative at all cost. This was also during the time when Clint Capela was regarded as the reason Atlanta was winning games. Obviously he's a huge part of the team, but anyone who denied Trae was the best player on this team was just grossly uninformed."
Clint Capela  John Collins  Gallo   Bog  Heurter  Lou Williams  Trae  Lebron’s 2007 team was a junior high school squad compared to this Atlanta team.
Clint Capela is better than Draymond  No @s please.
Lmfao.   A 7'3 shooting guard with a shit injury record + $30m contract.  Or Clint Capela who defends &amp; rebounds at a high level for basically half the money.  It ain't even a fucking contest.

"man, listen, I said this in the pregame thread, clint is legit. Embiid is easily the best center in the league but Capela is probably the third best defense center in the league."
"Dude in those game threads I was like haha yeah they should totally get rid of capela, there's only 26 teams who would pick him up in an instant  Embiid makes all other centers look terrible, it's just what he does.  If you judge capela by that standard then everybody who doesn't have embiid should just go smallball and run a 6'8 center  And look who had the last laugh anyway, hawks defense gets locked in and they are as good as anyone else in the league.   They funnel shots to capela like the jazz do to gobert and clint is just as terrifying"
Getting Clint Capela for the freeski
Clint Capela eats rebounds for every meal
Clint Capela - 19 monster rebounds
"Come on, you can't be serious, it's amazing Luka even gets 10 assists every night. Just think about it, his scoring options are Dorian finney-smith, Tim hardaway, Jr., Josh Richardson, boban and kristaps, all whom forgets how to shoot a ball every other night. Meanwhile, Trae has Bogdan, Danilo, John Collins, Kevin huerter and Clint capela. Can't compare the two, man."
"Not a one man carry, crazy deep team. John Collins and Clint Capela combined for 9 offensive rebounds"
clint capela is a monster
Clint Capela saved the day. Who woulda thought lol
"The Hawks worry me more as a matchup, even though the Bucks have a more complete roster — Clint Capela is a scary dude who robs a lot of Ayton’s matchup advantages. DA has been roasting offensive-minded centers, but there aren’t as many classic “eraser” bigs in the Western Conference as there used to be."
Clint 💪🏼💪🏼 Capela
Clint Capela is a baller fella
Would you consider Clint Capela a star?
clint capela is so good wtf
If Clint Capela wasn’t so fucking lazy Hawks would be up
He called John Collins Clint Capela earlier too
Clint Capela for face of league because he elevated Giannis' legacy
De'Andre Ayton and Clint Capela dont count as good defenders? Do you really think Gobert will give him that much trouble?
"Agreed, just less running around on the perimeter on both ends of the floor. I think the Lakers should just alter their starting lineup/rotation depending on who the opponent is during the regular season. If they're playing Embiid or Jokic, then start Gasol (or whomever their actual big is), but if they're playing against like Clint Capela or something, start AD at center."
"I know all of this, Clint has been injured plenty before, they never traded him because of it.  But being a Rockets fan also showed me that he didn't fit with Russ at all, and the Rockets spent more time making rotations around Russ + Capela instead of Harden + Russ"
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
"It's more to see who is tradable between him, Cam Reddish, oneyka Okungwu, maybe DeAndre Hunter idk.   It may also help them trade away Gallinari in a year or two. Maybe trade away Clint Capela.   To be honest the only guy who is worth the Max is Trae. John Collins is really good but I'm not sure about Max. While Kevin Heurter had a great playoff run he's not Max either. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish haven't shown themes to top players yet. Well maybe Hunter, but not Cam. Cams been too injured so we've only seen flashes.   We don't know anything about Oneyka Okungwu yet. So it gives options"
We used to call Clint Capela Swiss Miss because he couldn't finish shit his rookie year.   He improved over time.   I think Garuba may be able to get there as well.
"I have a feeling you're a fan without having actual basketball knowledge...The main issues the Rockets faced last year in the bubble were that they, for whatever reason, got rid of Clint Capela and were left with no size or good enough shooters to play effective spaced-out small ball. It turned in to Harden and Westbrook trying to iso and either pass out to a 3, where they struggled, or drive into the lane with towering big men in AD, Dwight Howard, and JaVale McGee. Given that LA already stuggles with 3 point shooting and Howard and McGee are no longer there, I don't see them doing much better, especially if AD is continually dealing with injuries. LeBron isn't getting any younger either."
They traded Clint Capela and basically turned russ into a center just because of how bad his shooting was
They already have clint capela
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
I don’t see why he can’t be Clint Capela on crack.
"The 4 out offense with 1 elite rim protector / scorer started in the 90s with Hakeem and saw utility again with the Van Gundy Magic.  Now 4+1 is the standard rather than 3+2 and more teams are going to a 5+0.  This may ultimately be a step towards ""solving"" basketball, meaning talent being equal, 5+0 &gt; 4+1 &gt; 3+2.  That isn't to say Zion Williamson can't thrive in the league.  At this point, it seems bigs are either only as valuable as the playmaker they are playing with - elite offensive engines are generating their looks (lebron &amp; dwight howard, trae young/harden &amp; clint capela) or have the ability to be a high efficiency offensive engine with gravity / playmaking (embiid / jokic).  Gobert is an example of the former and without Conley his offensive value tanked.  He lost the yin to his yang.  The Jazz tried to adjust their scheme by playing more iso heavy basketball.  I know people love Mitchell, but he just isn't efficient enough in isolation to make up for his lack of playmaking and I don't think they can win with him running the offense.  Overall, I think Gobert loses some defensive value in a true 5-0 and he loses some offensive value w/o a true playmaker."
"Browsing a few old Ringer draft guides...  Tatum was compared to Pierce, Granger, and Rudy Gay. That holds up ok.  Doncic got a lot of Harden comps... I can't think of anyone better to compare him to now so I think that holds up.  Josh Hart got compared to Wesley Matthews and that turned out ok, I think.  Robert Williams was compared to Clint Capela."
"# Team USA  * STARTERS:     * Curry, Harden, LeBron, Durant &amp; Anthony Davis * BENCH:    * Kyrie, Lilliard, Tatum, Paul George, Devin Booker, Beal &amp; Zion  # Team Euro  * STARTERS:    * Luka Dončić, Bojan Bogdanović, Giannis, Jokić &amp; Gobert    * BENCH:    * Domantas Sabonis, Clint Capela, Evan Fournier, Dennis Schröder, Bogdan Bogdanović &amp; Rubio"
His potential would be a more versatile scoring threat than Clint Capela is
"Bruh, Clint Capela was a key starter on a conference finals team. The disrespect."
Center is a position that peaks young. What exactly has he done to be considered better than like a Clint capela type
"Yeah that sounds like great evidence if you take out the rest of the trade. They also had to move back seven spots in the draft and gave up an additional first round pick. Memphis didn’t do this because they preferred Adams, they did it to move up in the draft and get the extra pick. NO got the better contract of the two centers and it’s not close. JV is much better than Adams and he’s on a cheaper deal. JV is actually what a premiere utility center on a moveable contract looks like. That’s why I like this deal for the Pels despite what they gave up. And Bledsoe’s contract is not as bad as you might be thinking because the second year was partially guaranteed.  Edit: also Clint Capela is a lot better than Steven Adams at this point in their careers."
Clint Capela and Zach Lavine
"Yeah I even argued the very same thing like 4 or 5 months ago in nbadiscussion. But it turned out that Porzingis just doesn't have the muscle, aggression and point of gravity to be an elite rollman which is a huge knock on his player profile.   I believe the Mavs offense would be historically great in the RS if they just had a guy like Clint Capela instead, a much more limited player that will play hard and catch any lob.   It's crazy how few lob plays the Mavs make when Porzingis is on the floor. The only elite roll-threat they have is Boban but he's unplayable in the modern era bar for 10 minutes per game.   I feel if Porzingis turned out perfectly healthy, maxed out all his talent he'd be somewhat like AD. But his lack of inside presence and refusal to do anything but pop and take a low-efficiency midrange really destroys the comparison."
"What is his ceiling? Clint Capela?   Don't get me wrong, that's a great player but is anybody expecting him to turn into Embiid?"
"The Hawks ""process"" was to introduce veteran talent 2/3 years into most guys rookie deals because that's the most financially viable option.   The team was ass, but that's more because of the veteran's we replaced with actual NBA quality players rather than our young talent underperforming across the board.   Yeah, Hunter/Huerter both took a major step this year, but they were always the plan.   Replacing Alex Len with Clint Capela makes any team better."
"Don't forget Clint Capela, we don't want to rob the lakers"
"Using ORTG as the hill you die on is quite an interesting take. It is such a flawed stat that takes into account lineups -- replacing Beal with a non-shooter has a bigger affect on Russ RTG than replacing Russ with a non-passer.  One of the teams he mentioned -- 2019 Rockets who he used as an example of ""Harden doing great with nothing"" -- had Clint Capela as their ORTG leader at 133. Guess he was more important to the offense than Paul and Harden who only posted a measly 118?  Anyway, Russ has for 3 straight years played like ass until all-star break, then turned it around and played like a fringe MVP. So the point of him being not worth his contract is still a valid take. OP tho is definitely trying to enter the iamverysmart HOF."
I was about to say Clint Capela. TIL Clint Capela is Swiss.
"I hate TS so much. While yes trae went from 58.9% TS in the regular season to 53.9 TS% vs Philly a 5% difference in the playoffs does not mean shit. Joel Embiid went from 63 TS% in the regular season to 58 TS% vs Atlanta, does that mean that  Clint Capela was locking up embiid because he had a 5 TS% difference???  Also even if his efficiency was worse Trae went from averaging 9.4 assists on 4.1 turnovers to 10.9 assists on 3.6 turnovers so his playmaking got better even if his efficiency was done  Ben didnt do shit"
"I don’t think people understand the differences between college and pro athletes lol. There’s a reason college coaches consistently say they’d get blown out by any pro team when they’re asked this. The difference in bodies is just massive. If Lebron played in the NCAA, he’d score as often as he wanted.  The same can more or less be said for any great scorer. Even a dude like Clint Capela would just be so, so strong that he’d be throwing centres out of the gym."
"Maybe 10 years ago. In today’s game there’s like 5 impactful team-leading centers. James wiseman very well could be Clint capela . The odds are more in favor of the wings.  As far as Wiggins, in a hypothetical trade to the wizards he has no value whatsoever.  He doesnt make others better, he’s 25 so he’d be too old for their new group.   It really is amazing how much he’s changed his perception based on  1 year. This sub LOVES Andrew Wiggins. It’s ridiculous"
Wasnt he on the rockets before? Dude has incredible amount of hustle saw him in person n he pushes it like westbrook too bad we had clint capela and then decided to just let pj tucker be the center
"TBH I see Wiseman as a Clint Capela type of player and that ain't bad at all.   Clint Capela in a sense that he's a good at rim running, good at defense, good as a roll man (although Wiseman has shown he can shoot a bit)  and he'll hustle. He can be an all-star if he develops a go-to move or two. Wiseman seems driven and I'm excited for him"
I wouldn't take Mobley until 5. All the Mobley stans are gonna be awfully quiet in two years when it's clear Mobley will be lucky to be as good as Clint Capela.
"Gee I wonder who’s gonna be more successful the fella playing with:  Loul Deng, Dion Waters, Spencer Hawes, Tristan Thompson  Or the fella playing with:  Clint Capela, Deandre Hunter, John Collins, Bogdan, Huerter  Almost like the one with better players around them had more success 🤔🧐"
"Harden would literally stand still on offense when he didn’t have the ball. He pushed for a questionable trade to get Westbrook which is even worse in hindsight. He shot 2-13 from 3 in a game 7 that was completely winnable on a team with a guy who just started and won the finals, a guy in the finals, and a pretty serviceable Clint Capela. Fertitta seems like an awful owner so I don’t completely blame Harden but give me a break. He was hardly the victim."
Never forget Trojan Horse Clint Capela
"Clint Capela up next, lock it in. Ignore my flair, I’m not biased at all."
Go ahead and pay him a max then. No one in the league would match anyway. Dude is Clint Capela with a slightly better mid range jumper.
"All credit goes to the hawks. No excuses. But clint capela is a really really good center, and if our starters were healthy they would have struggled. Tweaked ankle noel and taj Gibson had a really uphill battle there. Plus you guys did a great job game planning us, which i dont think other teams even try to do.    Maybe its wishful thinking but I don't think that was a choke job. You guys were a tough match up that played great. All there is too it"
"PG: Louie Dampier.   Dude was the ABAs best 3 point shooter. He'd kill it now.   SG: Sam Jones  His history details that if you need a clutch shot, you wouldn't find much worse than this guy to shoot them. Completely forgotten about, but would be way more impressive now.   SF: Rick Barry  A do it all guy who never misses free throws and can shoot outside shots? Good luck. Should be higher on the all time lists, IMO.   PF: Sam Perkins  This dude was the prototypical stretch 4.   C: Darryl Dawkins   Picture Clint Capela."
"And only 7 coaches total thought Gasol was a top 2 defensive center, and the coaches thought he was the 4th best defensive center that year.   I guess that means by your logic Clint Capela is a better defender than Giannis since Centers defence is more important"
"He can't create his own shot. Imo he's a Clint Capela level player, I think Capela is an even better defensive anchor and lob threat too."
&gt;Clint capela   Is one of the better rim protectors and paint defenders in the league and he still dropped 30 points lmao
"Superstars can’t be stopped, but let’s not ignore that first timers held Giannis to numbers you can live with in the Hawks series.   Giannis was defended better by Clint Capela and Okongwu in the Hawks series (that’s 2 30+ point games he was held to vs 2 40+ point games and a 50 piece)"
Clint Capela has never shown the passing and playmaking instincts that Rob has.
Clint fucking Capela? What?
I feel like Clint capela usually does well against Jok
That was one year of the Morey era tho and only because we had Russ   We were running Dwight Howard and Clint Capela for most of his tenure
"“The Morey-era Rockets” didn’t have a 6’5” starting center for most of the era. That was literally just one season.   The Morey-era Rockets started with Yao Ming, the second tallest player of all time, at center. And during the Morey-Harden era the centers were Omer Asik, Dwight Howard, and Clint Capela until the final season."
I think the biggest issue with Drummond is he doesn’t understand his role. He still thinks he can post up and be an offensive weapon in isos. He really just needs to take some lessons from Capela because that dude knows exactly what his role is and has gotten really damn good at it over the years and I think Drummond could be a bigger version of Clint.
"For the Mavs, probably Clint Capela? He seems like the 'worst' player that fills our biggest need and vaults us into championship consideration."
"Defensively yes  Offensively Clint Capela literally only looks decent when playing with PGs with elite floater games like Trae or Harden  I think there's a strong case to be made that Trae elevates his teammates more than Luka does, therefore arguably making him a better playmaker  When Luka has the ball the other guys just sit in the corner and do nothing while watching him dribble for 20 seconds"
Clint Capela wich is better than any player in the Mavs squad other than Luka.
agreed. One of them has never won a playoff series or a home playoff game. The other just carried a team whose 2nd best player is Clint Capela to the conference finals.
"It was his 3rd year in the league my dude, and he got significantly outplayed by 23 year old Clint Capela who was only in his 4th year. But keep making excuses."
"Clint Capela on Joel Embiid: ""Whenever you wear him out, everything becomes tougher for him. When the fatigue comes in, it's a different ballgame.""Jun 15, 2021"
"I think that's a product of a gap in the U.S. system of developing big men rather than Europe being especially good at it, since big men with unique skills isn't unique to Europe (see: Joel Embiid), and they're still producing strong players outside of the C (Fournier, both Bogdanovics, Luka) and Clint Capela has a pretty traditional skillset."
"If Simmons would be willing to play the 5 I could see that working, because he certainly can’t play with Clint. But I think Simmons would scoff at playing the 5. And we would need a third team in the trade to take Clint because the Sixers don’t need a center. I wonder what teams would value Capela enough to give up some value for him"
"&gt; He averaged 17 a game in the playoffs, 80% of 17 is 13.6. Excuse me, it is way, way, way easier to find a 13.6 ppg spot up shooter than it is someone that can bring 80% of what Ayton does on defense      Its funny because even when you use a super small sample size to make that statistical argument there still aren't forwards who give you 80% of Porter's production on similar efficiency.       Also you're overestimating Aytons defense, you act like he's Gobert or something.     &gt;  and that’s not even taking into account that Ayton averaged 1 less ppg on better efficiency in the playoffs      You're not taking into account how important spacing is. We see year after year some random low usage lob catching big lead the league in field goal percentage, its not the accomplishment you think it is. No one considers Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, or Jarrett Allen to be great offensive players. That's just what happens when you take most of your shots in the paint as a roll man."
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
So he'll be better than Clint Capela then
"I feel like this is odd choice of words. Did you mean ""Clint Capela with better offense""? Like that would make more sense to me.  But like Clint Capela with better defense? So Ayton is supposedly getting worse offensively while becoming top 3 defensive center?"
He's already better than Clint Capela?
Ayton’s peak will be Clint Capela with better defense.
"I refuse to believe that the Capela trade wasn't half made out of spite because he got Tileman's buy in, and half looking out for Clint and putting him in a great situation with a young passing PG in Ice Trae.   That trade didn't make sense any other way. The hawks gave up nothing and got the best player in a 4 team trade"
"I mean, yeah….  The fourth and fifth men would be pretty much average starters.  Joe Ingles.  Duncan Robinson.  Lonzo Ball.  Seth Curry.  Clint Capela.  Mikal Bridges.  Evan Fournier.  Nance.  Gary Trent.  An average starter would be somebody who’s serviceable on the court, who won’t win you games singlehandedly but contribute to the overall team.  Do I need to continue?  You need to get off 2k and start actually watching basketball, because your take is braindead."
Would you be interested in Clint Capela…
"Did you watch us in the playoffs? PG did well as a kind of point forward with Reggie, Batum and PatBev (now Bledsoe) helping w playmaking. Meanwhile we should've been much better on defense but weren't because we had Zubac as our rim protector. I'd take Clint Capela over Kyle Lowry anyday."

Mobley can already do things defensively and offensively that Capela isn’t capable of. Is Mobley raw? Definitely. But I think if you put Mobley on the Hawks instead of Capela they would be better by the end of the season than w/ Clint
"Capela is very underrated, he’s a top 10 center IMO. I think Clint is better rn but it’s arguable, mostly because Mobley is a better shooter"
"Facts. I don’t regret Green at all  But I was wrong about Mobley, he’s not that raw. His absolute floor is probably Clint Capela. It’s literally impossible for him to be a bust. See a lot of KG/Bosh"
"Bro here are the players that might not even be top 50 players right now(or at least it’s close):  Tobias Harris, Lonzo Ball, Clint Capela.  I don’t know how you can think Donte has that kind of upside."
MVP's don't get played off the court by the likes of Clint Capela and Terrence Mann.
Imma take it a step further and say Clint Capela. People talk about him like he is the basic bitch run of the mill rim running center but he is literally one of the best rim runners in the league AND he makes like 20mil a year idk
"One extremely shrewd but under-the-radar target would have been Jordan Mclaughlin. He’s been buried on the roster with the Wolves, but I think he could be a really good backup PG somewhere.   He’s tiny, but he’s got a ton of bounce (he postered Clint Capela in a game a few seasons ago), is a great ballhandler, solid shooter (36.5% from 3 in his career), he plays with effort on defense (though he’s limited there by his size), and he’s extremely safe with the ball.   As a PG, he’s super aggressive in getting the ball moved around, plays with a TON of pace. Every time he’s in as the primary ballhandler, it’s a shot in the arm to the offense. He may just be too small to play significant minutes in the NBA, but he’s got a ton of attributes you want in a backup PG. IIRC, he was been on two-way contracts his first two seasons and inked a 3 year/ $6 mil deal right before the season started this year."
And Clint capela and Bradley Beal
Is he not 100%? The Trae-Clint P&amp;R was working but Capela barely played in the second half
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
"we have no business boo'ing clint anyway, the guy is straight up demolishing us  we should boo ourselves for being unable to beat clint capela"
"Guys, I'm here from the future with footage of [Clint Capela in the 2nd round](https://streamable.com/em4fe2)"
"Yikes, I looked at your 2019 salary sheet and it's Kemba + Hayward on Max deals, and everyone else isn't making shit. You'd have to trade like 4 players to match salary, completely unworkable trade. You especially can't afford to sacrifice that much depth for him when he wasn't even going to play in the playoffs last year.  I'm starting to see how we got Capela for a low price, only bad teams with dead weight contracts on the books could afford to match salary, give up a pick or 2, and wait on Capela to get healthy in 2020/21. And bad teams usually aren't swinging big trades, it worked out well for us getting Clint and for the Suns getting CP3 tho."
he couldn't stand to look at crowder and ayton for another minute  they are gonna haunt his dreams  just like clint capela is my nightmare
the only reason he was traded was he couldnt match up with the warriors and we had to go small. draymond just totally buttfucked any lineup with capela.  however clint owned the rest of the league including the other top centers in the west in gobert and jokic.      it was really tragic timing the rockets blew up the team and went small ball to go at the warriors from another angle only for them to totally implode a few months later.   otherwise client wouldnt have been traded
"Gud ebening, Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks is one of the best passers in the game. The offense is potent when everyone is healthy, and De’Andre Hunter and Clint Capela are some of the anchors on defense. Cam Reddish is as well, but he is injured currently."
Rondo and Caruso are way better shooters than Simmons. Simmons has the same level of shooting as a guy like Jakob Poeltl or Clint Capela
"Naw, Clint was injured and didn't fit with Russ.  &amp;#x200B;  If he was healthy/if they had kept Chris Paul, Capela stays."
I think you meant to say Clint Capela
i dunno. drose called clint capela by the right name.
Sabonis is kind of the opposite of what they need. mavs need a non ball-dominant center who can catch lobs and protect the rim. clint capela would be a nasty fit.      sabonis at C would make their already bad defense even worse.
"""Who the hell made Clint Capela the tough guy?"""
"&gt; I never talked shit in my life. I'm not going to start now that Clint Capela said something. I'm too old for that shit, bro  Duncan never responded in interviews like this. Duncan was not as emotive and was far more articulate.    Idk how you can read the tweet and think ""wow he's the tim duncan of guards"" lol"
&gt;Physically speaking only another freak of nature can go toe to toe with him and take him out of his game. &gt;   Enter Clint Capela
I fuckin love clint capela and I hope this doesnt jinx us
"Oh, I totally agree stopping Gobert isn’t that impressive on its own, but he was stopping anyone who stepped in the paint, and guarding dudes out on the perimeter. Him soundly outplaying the defensive player of the year on defense, while simultaneously tearing it up offensively on the defensive player of the year just stands out to me more than what he did to KAT, as KAT was still able to have a good quarter or two each game. Clint Capela just demolished the Jazz every time he was on the court, and they had no answer for him."
What’s a Clint Capela?
Clint Capela has had a better career than Randle  He was the third option on a 67 win team that almost beat the Warriors
The only advantage Gobert has is that he's taller.  Capela is way more active and versatile.  We would cook Gobert so hard that the Jazz had to invent a new strategy to deal with it by guarding Harden from behind.  Meanwhile we would let Clint defend guards on the perimeter while Harden chilled in the paint.    Also he probably has the best hustle of any big.
Clint capela 👀👀
"He was hurt for a good portion of 2019, but when he was healthy he was putting up better numbers than he did in 2018.  I remember people saying Steven Adams was better than him, and I like Steven Adams and think he’s fairly underrated too, but Clint Capela is definitely better, and in a pretty big way."
"I agree, Randle has more shit to worry about than Clint fucking Capela atm"
"Clint ""The NBA Travel Agent"" Capela"
Imagine clint capela running at you full speed to clothesline you. That shit would be scary
Clint Capela literally did the finger wag in our last game with no tech.
Clint capela out here cutting a WWE promo for game 5.
Lol I don't think I've ever seen capela say anything like this. Talk your shit Clint
Clint Capela literally had a highlight of him doing the finger wag a week ago  edit: [3 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nncpp0/highlight_clint_capela_gets_the_block_on_randle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
"Tbh RoCo played more of the traditional big man role. PJ would defend the center if he wanted to post up, but RoCo would meet everybody at the rim.  But yes I'm glad that somebody mentioned that Daryl Morey basically traded away Clint Capela just to see if Russ could be successful as a center, and it kind of worked."
im telling u if the knicks did this to Clint Capela
Lmao facts with RAPTOR metric that says Clint Capela is 8th best player in NBA above KD and James Harden.  Carry on...
Bruh Steph had Klay Draymond and KD  Harden in 2017 averaged a career high 11 assists when his best teammates were Eric Gordon and Clint Capela. Due to his efficiency and the fact that he won a lot of games I truly believe he should have been the 2017 MVP
maybe Clint Capela

"Clint Capela is a better free throw shooter than luka as of late, and Capela uses different form each time at the line"
Harden averaged 11 assists in 2017 when his best players were Eric Gordon and a young Clint Capela try again
"Capela clogs the paint, Russ isn’t nearly the shooter trae is, and Russ dominates on driving into the paint and getting to the rim, when trae drives he scores with floaters. The rockets traded Clint to the hawks when the had Russ for this sole reason, Russ and capela just don’t work out very well together, you can even see Westbrook’s numbers explode after capela is off the court. And yeah westbrook is an elite passer but he’s not the playmaker trae is, trae gets trapped and double teamed more than any other player in this league except for luka, and that’s where the hawks having so many shooters provides an advantage, Russ doesn’t do that. Also traes floater game which is arguably the best in the league is what allows capela and Collins to be such big lob threats, Russ also doesn’t do that at nearly the level trae does. This team was built for traes playstyle."
"Clint Capela is a good Embiid stopper, scared of that matchup?"
"Yeah, people acted like it was some blowout, because they're filthy casuals. That was with that meme-worthy 'guard Harden from behind' defense that everyone clowned on. It actually fucking worked for the majority of the series, insanely.  Houston completely controlled the series, don't get me wrong, but Utah shot like 20% on a fuckton of wide open threes. Jae Crowder, Ricky Rubio, Royce O'Neale, and even Ingles and Mitchell were essentially ice cold.   Hence the last couple years of Utah moves. All offensive based, Conley, Clarkson, Bogdanovic, and adjusting to building even more of the defensive scheme around what Rudy brings to the table.   But Rudy was never played out of a series. It's not like Clint Capela was pulling him out of the paint, or like Harden was constantly getting Rudy on a switch. Wasn't happening like that."
"Clint ""I want the Warriors"" Capela"
"Bam is the perfect fit for him, essentially a better Clint Capela"
"&gt;if not then you're big for nothing.  Imo this is why shooting bigs are overrated. If you just need a guy for spacing, you might as well go small and switch everything instead of having Lauri or KP anchor your defense and get hunted in the PnR.  A stretch big would be nice if they could also play defense, but I'd rather just have Clint Capela than a stretch big with no defense"
Clint Capela
Clint Capela is exactly like I’ve always imagined basketball players to be as a kid

I would do so many things to have Clint Capela on our team
"The revival of Clint Capela has been a fun story. Goes from being a big part of Houston, to not knowing his role in Atlanta, to becoming one of the biggest parts of their playoff team."
exchange Porzingis for Clint Capela and the Mavs are title contenders
"he honestly doesn't need a second star, he literally just needs like Clint Capela lol"
Did Clint Capela also save 15% or more on Geico?
Yeah. The Hawks aren't going get FTs when we're making Clint Capela look like prime Amar'e Stoudemire with all the open rim runs and oops. We're getting outplayed on both ends and giving up wide open rim runs.
Clint Capela deserves All-Defense honors. He’s so good
Francis Ford Clint Capela.   Knicks shitting the bed.
"looking at it now. Clint Capela #10, Fred VanVleet #17 (above Beal), Mikal Bridges #19 (the highest Sun), Jakob Poeltl #21 (one above CP3)... needs some work"
Why does Clint Capela shoot less free throws than Anthony Davis? He’s rim running.
Clint Capela
"The top individual defenders against Jokic this year in no order were Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton (but mostly just in the 3rd/final PHX matchup), Clint Capela (in the first matchup with ATL, not the second), and ROBIN LOPEZ of all people. That's really been it this year."
"Tl;dr: No I’m not. I think this years performance was expected given fatigue, injuries, and covid - the first two I assumed would be a problem before the season started. People expected the Celtics to be way better because they assumed certain things about the team’s health that didn’t end up happening.  Kemba/Smart/the Jays have played less minutes together the entire regular season than they did in the bubble last year. Our ideal lineup in Kemba/Smart/Jaylen/Jayson/Rob Will has started only 7 games together. We went 6-1 with our only loss being against Philly and we beat teams like the Bucks and blew out teams like the Nuggets.  Only three guys have played at least 60 games: Pritchard has the most with 66 then Tatum with 64 and Grant Williams with 63. Every other team with a rookie leading the team in games played is in the lottery.   In this scenario, especially given that we are a top heavy team, you get things like Mo Wagner as a starting center, Jaylen Brown playing out of position as the starting point guard, or starting our two way player at point guard with our rookie point guard coming off the bench.  Atlanta, despite the many injuries, had John Collins, Trae Young, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon Hill all play over 60 games. The Knicks had RJ and Randle play 72 and 71 games respectively plus all of Bullock, Noel, Quickley, Payton, and Obi play at least 60. Miami’s probably had the closest situation to us but their rookie was at least fourth in games played as they had Robinson play all 72 games and Bam, Iggy, and Precious play at least 60. Bucks had Lopez and Forbes play 70 games and Pat, Middleton, Donte, Portis, and Giannis all play over 60.  There’s actually a ton more reasons I’m very optimistic about our future after having lower expectations than most this year but this is already way too long. I’m happy to share if you’re interested though."
Clint Capela is ahead in DWS and DRAPTOR. Defensive stats aren’t really the best way to compare players though. I’d like to see the Blazers with a different coach as well.
"He did... in year 1. Then Monty Williams got hired and he stopped using him in the post. Watch Ayton highlights from his rookie year. Even last year, at least he took mid-range shots. It’s tragic how he went from a imposing post and face-up threat to a Clint Capela/ Deandre Jordan type player.   Monty Williams, as great as he is, needs to be held accountable. There needs to be a middle ground in adjusting his role for current success and developing his game for the future."
They would’ve traded for James Harden 100% probably Clint Capela too
"Clint ""Charles Smith"" Capela"
how do you not know Clint Capela? and that's a genetic thing
CLINT CAPELA IS JUST SWISS THON MAKER
Giannis will end the night with 75/25/15 and in response Clint Capela will retire and the Atlanta Hawks will disband their franchise
&gt;!So does that mean Clint Capela is gonna eat Giannis in the middle of the series?!&lt;
"yeah because Chris Paul and Clint Capela make comparable amounts of money  the rockets last year would've literally had no use for ricky rubio, ty jerome, kelly oubre or jalen leque so i dont see where they get capela in all this  i just dont get how you think Luka and Capela is better than CP3 and Ayton, especially when you dont have to worry about the biggest problem with Luka and Booker - who's the first option? Luka is a ball dominant guard, Book's a ball dominant guard - just seems silly to me, especially when Ayton is as good as he is at such a young age  Capela grabbing boards isn't enough to anchor a championship-level defense, and neither is two ball-dominant superstars - basketball teams arent JUST about being good at scoring, they need to be versatile and having CP3, Ayton and Booker makes the Suns a more versatile team than if they had Luka, Booker and Capela"
Clint Capela is not going to be a championship contending center into his 17th NBA season...  He is an energy center that isn't an offensive threat. He's good on the defensive end but a clear downgrade from Ayton. He's already hit his potential and plateued.   Ayton is a potential star center who's got just about as much small ball center potential as you could ask for in today's game when you factor both sides of the floor.
If they had Luka they could’ve traded for Clint Capela instead. Luka-Book-Clint is a core that’s challenging for chips for a decade.
"1. Middleton, Giannis, Lopez and Holiday are four above average defenders. Embiid, Simmons, Thybulle are three above average defenders and one of them has the job of running the whole offense (Embiid). Bucks have more balance among the starting 5 and the perfect guard to make Trae work in Holiday. Work, not shut down. 2. Ben Simmons' D was actually decent it's just he was a nothing when it came to shooting, and it impacted how everyone else got played. Jrue Holiday is going to make Trae Young work on D when Trae gets switched onto him, that might fatigue Trae Young a bit.  3. The Bucks defense just put a beatdown on every Net not named Kevin Durant, Middleton makes a lot of clutch defensive plays, Giannis can be awesome as a second rim protector, Lopez has a ton of veteran experience to man the middle and knows his role. I think this team makes Clint Capela work a lot cause Gallinari is gonna be a liability more IMO."

Clint Capela deserves a max
"Barely anyone has said this. We all know what his issues were and we stand by them. Of course we're going to wish him the best, he's a nice dude.  The only people who are saying they never criticised him are people who barely go on the sub, and thrive off of negativity. We have like the most negative sub, every game thread had typical people who would complain and blame for no reason.  If you actually pay attention and go on our sub, you'll see that the main belief is that it was time to part ways.  Y'all motherfuckers don't watch us play.  Dude never utilised our shooters. We were 30th in 3-point attempts and I think 30th in FTA. He spammed PnR, even when Brogdon was driving into Bam. He liked ISO hero ball, with Oladipo handling the ball for 20 seconds before taking a long 2. He made no adjustments and let runs go on too far. We collapsed every 3rd quarter. He lost the locker room. He had no inbound plays, Brogdon even complimented Bjorkgren on drawing up plays. We never played our young guys, just look at Alize Johnson, Georges Niang, or Edmond Sumner.  His system works for Trae Young and Clint Capela, but it didn't work for us. You build a system around your players, not the other way around."
Clint Capela effect
"So in your opinion   Bam Adebayo is also completely useless right?   Gobert for sure, Clint Capela, etc"
"Ur getting downvoted, but I see your point. So far the Bucks strategy has been to outrebound the opposing team, score in transition and get in the paint. I don’t see them getting as many boards or paint scores in this series because this time they actually have to face a top 5 rebounding centre in Clint Capela. I don’t think that the Bucks will get 17 offensive boards in a game like they did against the Nets. One thing Mke have going for them is Jrue and his defence, which will be essential against Trae. Then again, Trae can easily switch to facilitating when his shot isn’t falling. Then again, who the fuck is guarding Giannis in this series?"
Clint capela = giannis killer
"Yeah the only guy his size on the floor for most of game 7 was Trae, and that was Ben's assignment since game 2. Every other player he could guard had over 5 inches on him (pause), could shoot, or was Clint Capela"
"bro what? Clint Capela tried that, he reverted back for a reasonn"
Hawks literally traded the 17th pick in the nba 2020 draft (Aleksej Pokuševski) for Clint Capela. That’s a steal if you ask me
I love Clint Capela ❤️
why would he go smaller vs Clint Capela over bruce brown and blake griffin
"Been a fan since he owned Gobert in the playoffs a few years ago. Twice, by the way.   Interesting fact: as a starter, Clint Capela holds playoff series wins over Gobert (x2), Embiid, Randle and KAT."
Lmao I was literally at that game and I know that’s not true. Clint Capela and Trae Young were called for fouls in the first quarter i know that for a fact.
Clint Capela with Stephen Curry's shooting accuracy and De'Aaron Fox's speed.
"Out of curiosity I ranked players by PPG to see how many have a negative AST/TO. The only players with negative ratios in the top 100 are:    Embiid - 2.8/3.1   MPJ - 1.1/1.3   John Collins - 1.2/1.3   Clint Capela - 0.8/1.2   DeAndre Ayton - 1.4/1.5   Rudy Gobert - 1.3/1.7   Darius Bazley - 1.8/2.2   Lauri Markannen - 0.9/1.0   Brook Lopez - 0.7/0.9    That’s the list. 91 other players are able to shoulder a scoring burden without having a negative ratio, regardless of their position or role in the offense.   The thing all these guys have in common? No handles. I think if Embiid wants to take another step towards being the most dominant player in the league has has to work on his handles and reading the defense when he’s double-teamed in the post."
"Clint Capela, leading rebounder in the NBA, will not stand for this take any longer. Give him some credit."
Capela is a good comp at the moment but Ayton is bigger and younger than Clint is right now.
"What's more interesting is how little of what that 2014- 2015 team became assets for them:  * The following left in free agency for nothing: Al Horford, Paul Millsap, DeMarre Carroll, Thabo Sefolosha, Pero Antic, John Jenkins, Elton Brand, Austin Daye (waived in his final season) * Adreian Payne traded that season (his rookie year) to the Twolves for the pick that became K'Von ""Red Velvet"" Huerter  * Following were traded for things that didn't matter: Mike Scott  (a 2nd that did not convey), Shelvin Mack (traded for washed up Kirk Hinrich in his final season), Korver (traded for a retired Mo Williams, Mike Dunleavy Jr. in his final season and a 1st that did not convey). * Schroder was traded for a pick that conveys next year plus a whole bunch of nothing. *  Jeff Teague traded for Taurean Prince and a pick that was packaged with other picks to get DeAndre Hunter. * Kent Bazemore and a future first eventually became Clint Capela.   So in summary, from that roster they only really got Clint Capela, Huerter, and DeAndre Hunter. 4/5 of the ""NBA Player of the Month"" team left for nothing. I remember there was a lot of criticism of the Hawks for not getting assets for their players, but it didn't really matter. Schlenk did a good job of rebuilding through the draft and free agency."
"This is crazy I just looked up the stats for that game and the Timberwolves held Trae Young, Kevin Heuter, Clint Capela, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdonavic, Lou Williams, Oneyeka Okongu, and John Collins to 10 points combined that game.  It's almost like they are two completely different teams and at that time the Hawks did suck."
"Haha, but you have watched Luka play, right?   “I’m not saying Young or Ayton are better but it’s definitely interesting to see their teams have success…”  Come on bro, it’s not that interesting.  Ayton is the third best player on a stacked roster. Booker is a king in waiting and CP3 is CP3.   Luka is throwing lobs to Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith.  Trae is throwing them to John Collins and Clint Capela.  When shit breaks down Luka might have KP to rely on, or he might be hurt. In that case, Tim Hardaway Jr is their next best threat.  The Hawks have Bogdan Bogdan, K’von Huerter and Danilo Gallinari to score the ball if Trae is cold.  I know that no one was big on Atlanta this year, but I thought the roster upgrades were that of a playoff team, and they are clearly a much, much better team than was expected. They are a much better team than the Dallas Mavericks.  Luka might have a bad attitude in some respects, but I don’t recall Michael Jordan being a joy to interact with.  Luka Doncic is one of the best three or four players in the league already. He gets to the basket so easily, he’s so big and strong. He’s an incredible passer, a clutch shooter, and a great competitor.  If the draft happened again, TODAY, Luka Doncic is the unanimous number one pick. Tell me I’m wrong."
Offensive JUGGERNAUT Clint Capela with a double digit scoring average
"Honestly I see him as the perfect replacement for Clint Capela. They both have the exact same level of offense, but Ben would be great on pick and roll defense. Most teams run the PnR with their big to get the switch. Not going to want to bring Ben over to guard your guard because he can actually do it.   Also imagine how crazy their offense would be with Ben grabbing the board and immediately pushing the ball up the court to all those shooters. You’d get a lot of 5 on 4’s because no other big in the league could run with Ben after he grabs the ball and goes."
The wizards barely had a starting caliber center. The Hawks have Clint Capela who is one of the strongest and best defensive centers in the league. Ben would have gotten slaughtered by him
PG = Patricio Garino  SG = Si Green  SF = Sharrod Ford  PF = Phil Farbman   C = Clint Capela   Why the fuck did I do this
"**PG: Paul George**  Unfortunately, there appears to be no PG in NBA history with the initials PG. I'm gonna cheat and slide Paul George in there.   **SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander**  Fits perfectly  **SF: Sherell Ford**  Never heard of him. Only small forward with the initials SF. He played one season in his career. Started one game, where he played 14 minutes and put up 2 points on 1/6 shooting along with 0 rebounds, 0 assists, and 1 steal. Liability in our lineup.  **PF: Phil Farbman**  Dude played in the 40s lol that's how desperate we are. According to basketball reference he was a forward. Doesn't have his position other than that, so we'll count it even though he was 6'1. Didn't play in the NBA either. Put up 3 points per game in the BAA in 1949 though!  **C: Clint Capela**  This seems fair"
Trae: Hi Ben I’m Clint Capela  Ben: Oh fuck no  Trae: Jk lmao
One of the old members from Rockets will win championship   Suns Chris Paul  Clippers Pat Bev  Hawks Clint Capela  Bucks PJ Tucker
"this Hawks team is Trae Young, playoff choker Clint Capela, and a bunch of random role players"
"It's not the teams, it's the conference. Would Kawhi and PG get roasted and toasted by Clint Capela?"
"Thank Shlenk for that as well. This roster is so well constructed; my favorite thing about this rebuild is the clear vision our organization has carried.  We get Trae and John Collins to build around; together, they are a well rounded pair that can collectively shoot from deep, play in the post, and run an offense. Then you grab a traditional center in Clint Capela, who can anchor your defense and get rebounds. Drafting well in Deandre Hunter and Reddiish, while Okongwu is proving to be developing nicely. Finally we have shooters off the bench in Bogdanovic, Gallo, and Huerter.  If Trae can't get 30, he can just get assists. If he is having trouble in that, we have other ball-handlers to help out. It's weird being happy with an Atlanta FO, but the Hawks have been doing great in that regard."
imagine Chris Paul and Clint Capela in the finals while Jim Harden watches from ~~home~~ the scrip club
What did the Hawks trade away to get Clint Capela?
The Trae Young/Clint Capela floater/lob RPO strikes again.
It's the Clint Capela Dunk Game.
"Man I love this Hawks team. And they probably have TOO many young pieces when healthy. They’re loaded   Porzingis for Deandre Hunter/Cam Reddish, Okongwu, and Clint Capela. Who says no?"
he plays the role of a Houston clint capela but he has a lot more talent and he shows flashes of it at points in every game. I really hope he grows into his own as an all star in the future because right now he is absolutely killing it
Happy Father's Day to Clint Capela. I know your son Joel is proud of you
"I’ve never seen Luka play offball once in my life, also Booker and Luka would clash egos. There’s no chance the suns org hands the keys to Doncic without Book leaving.  CP3 isn’t the future of the Suns, Book is and always will be.  Clint Capela is honestly much worse then Ayton and a backcourt of Luka and Booker would be one of the worst defensive backcourts in the league.  That team you just suggested would be a second round exit for sure.  Also you are just nonchalantly glossing over the leadership CP3 instilled into the team. Terrible take."
Lol. They wouldn’t have CP3 if they drafted Luka. Luka and Booker could fit the same way that CP3 and Booker fit. Use the money/assets spent on Chris Paul for Clint Capela. That team would be absurd and suggesting otherwise would be nonsense. Luka doesn’t play off-ball because the only real chance the Mavs have of winning is for him to be the playmaker as often as possible.
"Mitchell Robinson is our best defensive player on our team who was top 3 in defensive rating. He’s also probably the best lob threat in the league and considering that Clint Capela was able to sit in the paint all series against the Knicks, there’s also an argument about the massive impact he would’ve had if Clint had to worry about the lob and not just play up high without any regard. You’re also just assuming the Knicks are going to look completely the same next season and you’re also completely disregarding the fact that this is a young team and that young playershappen to take leaps from time to time"
The fuck did Clint Capela do to you???
"I mean there was nothing else HOU could do. Warriors were playing physical defense in the paint and HOU was getting 0 calls so they switched to perimeter shooting and their shots just didn’t fall. There’s no gameplan that can prepare James Harden, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Clint Capela to beat Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green... especially in a shootout"
"1. Yes pretty much  2. Pick two of John Collins, Clint Capela, or Gallinari. Gallinari is pretty much the only other shot creator for the team."
"I don’t think a lot of fans here are old enough to have watched and appreciated Orlando Dwight. Yeah he wasn’t a great go to guy in the post in an era where coaches loved throwing the ball down low to even the worst scoring bigs, but had he been in his prime now he’d be like Clint capela but a better defender. There’d be no Dwight post ups, he’d screen roll and beat his man to the basket on fast breaks. He was an amazing athlete and he was an incredible rim protector with better defensive instincts than he was ever given credit for."
It’ll be Hawks v Clippers like everyone predicted. Clint capela finals mvp.
"His play. Stop taking threes until you learn how to shoot  Stop taking turn around jumpers  Stop dribbling  Be a legit big man  Run the floor, set screens, run the floor  If he just acted like Clint Capela with a mid-range game (where he's shooting designed plays, again, not this turn around, step back bullshit giannis thinks registers as a mid-range game) he'd win an MVP every year  But nah, I gotta dribble for 7 seconds and take a step back jumper for ****REASONS**** and odds are extremely high I'm going to brick the fucking shot and then do it again in 7 minutes  and more importantly, learn how to fucking shoot free throws"
At worst he would be a significantly better Clint capela
"&gt;offensively, what does he do more than someone like clint capela?  Nothing, Clint is a better offensive player. But he also has the advantage of playing with one of the best passing guards in the league."
"&gt; He is better offensively than most think  he's decent on the pnr, but only when he dives to the hoop.  otherwise, he's pretty limited offensively, definitely not worth 200mil.  he doesn't really post up, has limited range, and doesn't attack the offensive boards like that.    offensively, what does he do more than someone like clint capela?"
"Could Giannis replicate Rudy Gobert on defense through sheer physical similarity, or is there more to Gobert’s defense?  So if we took another lanky and lean athletic beast like Giannis, and put him in Gobert’s exact defensive role (let’s assume he also gains Gobert’s offensive ability), are the Jazz worse or better?  I’m just thinking, there must be something about Gobert than actually makes him a 3x DPOY, right? Or else Clint Capela would have multiple DPOYs as well, and so on. What really distinguished him from others? IQ? Even better athleticism? I ponder about that a lot"
Clint Capela has a higher approval rating right now over the top two in DPOY voting lol
"He's not a guy who can just create for himself though, the offense has to utilize him in the PnR and they are giving him almost no touches, even when he's open on the roll. A lot of this has to do with coaching and system. Think James Harden tossing lobs to Clint Capela a few years ago, they need to execute more sets to get him involved"
"It’s really funny. I was getting down voted too. I said the Clippers would win because they have more star power and the Jazz don’t have Wings to stop PG and Kawhi. I also called the Clippers 5 outing and Gobert being a glorified Clint Capela who’s only making 15 Mil. Just to get down voted and called a casual too when I watched Utah struggle against the Warriors and Rockets, 2 perimeter centric teams."
"Clint ""Ben Simmons"" Capela"
Honestly Okungwu has been much better than Capela this series. We could probably survive less Clint minutes if OO could guard Embiid without fouling him
"“Joel Embiid, you’re not gonna cover Clint Capela tonight, you’re gonna go one-on-one…. WITH THE UNDERTAKER!”"
"For starters, rebound. How is Clint Capela the league leading rebounder but he’s getting sinned by embiid"
Granted it's a hard matchup but Clint Capela hasn't been very good for us this series
Clint Capela has been hot garbage for at least 3 games straight now
"Sixers offense sucks, Joels hurt, (sort of) Hawks offense is pretty great, Clint Capela will do an okay job guarding Embiid, and of course Ben Simmons is an offensive liability.   So basically, no"
Looks like he has all the making of becoming a Clint Capela type roll man with a good PG.
You know who else is an offensive liability? Kemba Walker. Moses is still young and can potentially fill in his frame a bit more and become a solid player. He reminds me of very very young Clint Capela.
Very very high potential. Reminds me a lot of Clint Capela when he was really young at Houston. Loads of potential but super raw at the moment.
"He's the stereotypical decent defense, cant score outside of 3 feet from the hoop, amazing rebounder type center. Think Steven Adams/Clint Capela lite, he's very young and has potential to improve but his skill set is fairly easy to replace. He's got starter potential on a playoff team and he'd be a quality backup at absolute worst."
Lightning can't strike twice. Easy 4-3 win for the bucks. I wonder how Giannis will be against Clint Capela.
Some of my favs:  AD  Bam Adebayo   Facundo Campazzo  Clint Capela
"Ask anyone just 6 months ago if they’d rather have Clint Capela and John Collins or KP and Josh Richardson on /r/NBA and everyone would say the latter. Luka is a great passer and playmaker but Trae’s ability to run an offense and raise a player’s floor is on another level imo. I believe that’s more the reason for discrepancy between the teams than actual talent.  Also, the Clippers successfully exploited Luka on defense far more than either Philly or New York has to Trae, so the defensive argument doesn’t hold water. Any competent front office would rather have a deep playoff run from their young star than All-NBA awards, hell, it might be seen as a positive given they don’t have to pay him a supermax contract."
"Not one second did I believe that Clint capela, John Collins, Lou Williams, Gallo, Huerter, Hunter, Reddish, fucking Bogdanovic  Is worse than Kleber, Brunson, THj, Josh Richardson, Dwight Powell, DFS.  Not one fucking second. Every GM would rather take the hawks core then and now, just like they would take Luka instead of Trae if they could choose right now.  Your just on a fucking mission and you fail to see how weirdly you spin your take. The mavs players are shit, their boxscores look ok because of Luka, and you then put the Luka inflated role player stats to say his team is better. Whatever  Trae is fucking lit anyway"
Clint Capela has completely psyched out Embiid
Clint capela is a black hole that sucks in the D better than a hooker. Add in Traes range and the two are an unguarded match made in heaven
"&gt; Embiid, who was accused of fading over time by Clint Capela after Game 4, ran out of gas again after a monstrous first half.      🤣"
"Lol the Sixers fans were so fucking mad at Clint Capela for daring to say that their gold boy gets fatigued as the game goes on and gives us a chance to get back in it. Embiid heard the clip and came out and fucked Clint Capela up and down the court the whole first half. And then guess what happened? The third quarter hit and he got fucking fatigued and we got back in it. Clint didn't play well and it was actually the defensive stops of Okongwu mixed with the shooting of Lou Will that turned it around for us in the late 3rd/early 4th, but Clint was absolutely right that Embiid once again got tired and early and the team crumbled when he did."
last year his third scoring option was Jabari Parker..until the trade lol and Atlanta had a 43 year old Vince Carter on the floor with Trae Young sometimes. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish were rookies and weren't they running DeWayne Dedmon/Alex Len for center? it's almost like..you put a true superstar floor general with a real roster and suddenly things like this start happening. Last years Hawks didn't even play a minute of Clint Capela after the trade
Nah he should be the one person that doesn’t deserve criticism tbh  He’s playing with back issues and a torn meniscus and still had a great game yesterday aside from the FT’s. This is against Clint Capela too who is one of the best defensive centers in the league  Also it’s not like he has great spacing to work with Hawks basically just triple teamed him in the paint and hacked him on that final play
Clint Capela is about that life
Clint Capela; Swiss defensive anchor. LMAO  Lost job to 6’6” SF.
Are you suggesting that Ben Simmons is a better center than Clint Capela? You're smoking crack bro 😂
"I said this to a friend as a joke, but this team would be insane if ben simmons could turn himself into a much better passing, more athletic clint capela. At least in terms of their roles."
"Yeah I think he could play the 4 or the 5 pretty well in a different system that has a playmaker, especially Chris Paul. He would be great as a roll man, sort of like Clint Capela, but a major upgrade because he can dribble and pass out of the post, but still initiate the fast break if he gets a rebound."
