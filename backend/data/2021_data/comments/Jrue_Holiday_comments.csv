Jrue Holiday gets no respect.
"I don't think so. Gordon is one of the best true 4s that plays both sides of the court in todays game that could space the floor, and although he hasn't played it at all due to personnel on Orlando and Denver, has the tools to be a good small 5. Tbh he's reaching pre-2018-Jrue Holiday level of underratedness."
"2009 got to be the worst; James Harden, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday and even Jeff Teague (had an all-star appearance!) and the only one he went for was Ricky Rubio."
"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
&gt;Luka is a very rare talent but he needs another super star to really be a contender.  And Giannis doesn't? Khris Middelton and Jrue Holiday are both way better than anyone Luka has
"Jrue Holiday got no fouls called him in the playoffs, pretty sure the refs will just decide on a game by game basis how much contact is allowed."
Jeremy Lamb?  Jordan Poole?  Jrue Holiday?
The same people that just watched Jrue Holiday win a chip with his excellent defense. No reason to act like it isn't very beneficial to a team to have a top flight perimeter defender.
"&gt; The 04 Pistons?   I like how I said about 19 of the last 21 and you just respond with a team and a question mark. What about all the teams with superstar scorers?   &gt; Look, the NBA pays role players to play great defense while providing minimal scoring. There are guys sitting overseas and out the league who can only score, while guys like Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday make top dollar.  Lol it's because scoring can be a lot easier outside of the NBA. A borderline bench player should average at least 20ppg in China. Duncan Robinson just got a $90M contract so acting like guys don't get paid for shooting and scoring is ridiculous.   &amp;nbsp;  You also ignore that both of the players you mentioned had major injuries and are on the wrong side of 30. Another issue that Melo had to face was dealing with his change of role. You mentioned him getting blacklisted but he is in the league for his shooting and scoring."
"The 04 Pistons? Look, the NBA pays role players to play great defense while providing minimal scoring. There are guys sitting overseas and out the league who can only score, while guys like Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday make top dollar.   Guys on the out at one point or another like IT and Melo were both blacklisted over defensive concerns. This is very basic basketball knowledge. Draymond Green can’t score at all and he’s flirting with a max bc of his defense/IQ."

"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
"It's like saying that kobe is overrated by looking at the stretch between the shaq dynasty and the pau years. It's OK to point out the obvious. What's annoying to anyone who watched those teams are ppl acting like the team was actually pretty good. If I could create a modern version of that team for visualization:    Josh Richardson AI MKG Bobby Portis (No good dikembe comp, imagine an older gobert where his jumping diminishes).  6th man (mckie) like a poor man's jrue holiday.    Like yes, really effective defensive team, but holy shit, zero spacing and all players liable to get extremely cold at any given time at the other end. What made AI so great despite the inefficiency was that he would still put pressure on the defense regardless every possession so there was never a play off even if there was a scoring drought causing the opposing team to be alert and extend energy, and he always racked up fouls bc he wasn't afraid of going inside and getting hit."

You’re citing advanced defensive metrics that are pretty much entirely team based. Donte plays on a team of elite (and I mean elite) defenders. DPOY and arguably the best defensive guard in Jrue Holiday. Brook Lopez is also a great rim protector. No shit his defensive metrics are gonna be through the roof. Nobody who watches him play believes he’s an elite defender.   &gt;better than OG that season  He’s not even better than OG in his rookie season defensively
"1.	Robert Covington, Klay Thompson, Joe Harris, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges are both better 3 point shooters and better defenders than Lonzo 2.	He has never impacted the defense like an elite option has before. Sure, hes a good defender, but Jrue Holiday is so many tiers above him and didn’t get a defensive award in 2020. Why would the Pels get such a terrible defensive rating on the perimeter if Lonzo was actually “elite”. 3.	He is not an elite playmaker in the half court. In fact, he his below average for a point guard. There’s a reason he was relegated to 3&amp;D over fucking Eric Bledsoe. He doesn’t have handles and cannot create his own shot. He was the secondary playmaker when Jrue started as SG. 4.	please tell me how he’ll be better than Zach Lavine, DeRozan, Lowry, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, LaMelo, Trae, Harden, Butler, Garland, Sexton, etc to get an all star vote. Especially since he’s the 4th best player on his team"
"&gt;KD was just very unsuccessful against Giannis.  While I wouldn’t deny this in general. In OT of game 7, Giannis didn’t guard KD on one shot attempt. I don’t think Giannis was why he was unsuccessful these past playoffs especially since Giannis did not spend a lot of time on him. It was Jrue holiday/Khris/and even Brook Lopez who caused him issues in that OT"
Bol bol is more popular than nba champion jrue holiday
Is he a role player ? Because with his new contract we may as well be calling jrue holiday a role player if Ayton is considered one
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"
"Jrue Holiday shot 36/26 splits and Middleton shot 36% or worse in 4/7 games in that series. You’re conflating what should have happened on paper with what actually happened in real life. Yeah we only barely beat a hobbled Nets, had nothing with do with Giannis who absolutely dominated outside of game 2. The struggle was Middleton and Jrue being garbage compared to what they should have been on paper. Meanwhile the only game KD actually won by himself was also the only game where he actually got significant help, because when it was genuinely him against the world he couldn’t win a team game by himself."
"That game wasn’t Bucks vs Nets, it was Giannis and Middleton vs KD Bruce and Kyrie with a Guest appearance in Jrue Holiday at the end of the game"
"It was an awful series lol. No argument  Doesn't mean it was worse than butler. He was 8% higher TS% while being doubled by Anthony Davis and Jrue holiday all series, instead of being dared to hit wide open shots lol"
"Middleton was an allstar in 2020 and 2019, Jrue Holiday is the best perimeter defender in the league. Let’s just pretend Giannis carried scrubs then. Teammates aside, Kd’s just a more skilled and clutch basketball player. I definitely give Giannis the edge on defense tho. They are close btw and I could understand someone saying Giannis is better."
Yeah definitely 1. Steph Curry 2. Chris Paul 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damien Lillard 6. Mike Conley 7. Jrue Holiday 8. Trae Young  9. Malcom Brogdon 10.De’aaron Fox
"Go listen to the Jrue Holiday interview on JJ's podcast, they were grasping at straws at how to slow down KD lol they were trying to do a lot of things. But I think trying to insinuate that Giannis intentionally let him get by to ""funnel"" him to Lopez is just a reach. He got crossed up and beat off the dribble."
Thanasis has more followers than:  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  James Harden  Kawhi Leonard  Rudy Gobert  Who's the GOAT now?
We gonna act like Jrue Holiday isn't the best perimeter guard in the league?
"Sorry my point didn't come across clearly - I'm not criticising Gobert's defense, I'm criticising the defense of the perimeter players on Utah. They had been bad the entire season, especially when Conley sat, and it was exposed against a top tier team in the playoffs. You replace that with Portland, where nurkic is competent as a defender but not close to Gobert and RoCo playing out of his optimal defensive role. I just don't see them being a good defensive team against any specific team.  The Bucks also had a DPOY, jrue holiday and middleton. Tucker and to a lesser degree Brook are more specialist defenders but with those three as the core your defense is going to be good against basically any team."

"To use an example, I'd be satisfied with Blake Griffin or John Wall with #1 picks. But the average value of the first pick is probably lower, like a Jrue Holiday, but I wouldn't happy with that at all."
It depends what standard you are applying because nobody can guard Jokic or Embiid one on one in the post. Lebron can (or could) definitely guard the 5 for short stretches and do a decent job. Being able to guard 1-5 doesn't mean he is Hakeem at the 5 and Jrue Holiday at the 1.
"Jrue Holiday, Passionate Sandwich Connoisseur"
"&gt;It's because ESPN forced the narrative that you squandered AD's career  Do you feel like they didn't squander the years they had with AD? Even if you discount the horrible acquisitions via trade and the bad contracts they handed out during those years (Omer Asik anyone?), at the very least they shouldn't have waited till he left before signing a dedicated medical and training staff for the team.   Up until AD left [they had been using the football specialists from the Saints to monitor their basketball players.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/01/08/report-pelicans-medical-staff-panned-for-being-too-football-centric/amp/) That's most likely what led to the Pelicans always being among the league leaders in games missed due to injuries every year. Guys like Eric Gordon (173 missed games in 5 years in NO), Jrue Holiday (159 games missed in 7 seasons there), Ryan Anderson (98 games missed in 4 years there) and Tyreke Evans (45 games missed in 2.5 seasons there) were routinely missing half the season every year with injuries during AD's time there.   It seems to me like the narrative that they squandered AD's career there is a perfectly valid one rather than something ESPN made up. Even former commissioner David Stern said that they were a poorly run team and that [Dell Demps was ""a lousy GM""](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/david-stern-pelicans-dell-demps-a-lousy-general-manager/) who would probably lose AD due to his incompetence. This wasn't just something ESPN invented."
Blake’s cheap shots compared to giannis and him injuring kyrie and poking several other players in the eyes! Same with pj tucker! Y’all delusional.  Obviously the playoffs get dirty but y’all really went for it. You won against injured teams (cp3 got a surgery right after the champs) and think you’re hot shit. The only reason why I’m happy for y’all is bc Jrue Holiday is the shit and deserved it. Carry on
Closest thing would probably be if Steph Curry played defense like Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday likes this comment.
Yeah that makes no sense.   KD was the NETS best defender  But better defense over Jrue Holiday or Giannis?!? No

"Au contraire, the Bucks PG is Jrue Holiday and the Lakers is Russell Westbrook"
Jrue Holiday: Fullcourt Defense
"Jrue Holiday is the modern-day non-HOF version of GP. Combination of good PG playmaking, scoring and overall defense."
"is this post a troll or something? they got rid of adams and bledsoe, but they were so bad they had to waste their 10th overall pick to do it. pelicans keep on downgrading at pg, going from jrue holiday, to lonzo ball (who has become a good defender and shooter now), to bledsoe, to end up with devonte graham. how is this an excellent pickup? he doesn't play defense and shoots the same percentage as lonzo from 3. so griffin decided to flip lonzo to lose his defense and gain what? nothing lmao, lonzo is also a better facilitator than graham because he has chemistry with zion and is an excellent passer. graham will need 2 years at least to build that same level of chemistry. pelicans cannot maximize both of their all-stars without a superstar who plays defense. and this team doesn't have a single defender, so i think they're going to suck even more this year. they will get to the play-ins only if san antonio, sacramento and other teams do worse than them. no way they're getting into the playoffs"
"&gt;that was a while ago and things are different now.  It was a little over a year ago, not that long lmao. But I mean yeah, now the Clippers are worse and the Nuggets are even better lol. Even in that same series Murray averaged like 30 a game against Pat Bev, PG and Kawhi so I really don't know what you're talking about. When was the last time Gobert or Embiid stopped Jokic? Unless you're a Jrue Holiday type defender, I'm not seeing too many people that can slow down Murray or many guys that can contest a 3 pointer from MPJ.  &gt;tons of players who will pick on your front court to hell  Again, we have AG who can effectively guard anyone 1-4, but is at his best when matching up against bigger wings. PJ Dozier is probably our best guard defender so he (assuming he's healthy) can match up with the likes of PG or Booker.   Team defense is a thing and overall I don't think we're any less equipped to handle a team with good offensive players than any anyone else, especially of the teams/players you mentioned."
"Lmao easy lakers sweep, Bucks could barely beat KD and a bunch of fucking bum role players. Jrue Holiday was literal garbage on offense all playoffs i would trust Ben Simmons at the FT line more than Holiday with an open 3."
Part of the reason the Nuggets were ready to get rid of Gary was because they have faith that PJ Dozier can replace the Harris role on defense while being a somewhat better shooter on way less money. The POA defender is probably the most important position in the Nuggets defense because we give up so many floaters and mid range shots that you need someone like Gary(who’s Jrue Holiday level at getting through screens) to stay on the ball handlers hip when they drive and force them to make a decision with Jokic’s massive plodding body standings in front of you and a great defender in Gary on them. Like you said Gary coming back probably saved us vs Utah because we had a guard who could get through screens and let us play defense the way we wanted to. Mitchell couldn’t split the traps or get straight line drives and pull-ups when Jokic dropped every play like games 1-4
"JJJ is the one for the Grizz, this is a big year for him to prove it. Otherwise he’s in the same tier as Bagley (and the same goes for marvin)  Unless Dillon brooks becomes jrue holiday 2.0 in which case that backcourt is gonna be great"
"Jrue ""Mentally Penetrated"" Holiday"
"If Jrue Holiday had more points, assists, rebounds, blocks per game on better efficiency with a higher +/- than Giannis, then yeah he would deserve finals MVP. That’s literally how much Durant outperformed Steph in the series."
Jrue Holiday 2021 Finals MVP for sure lolll
Smart’s been selected for 1st team all defense twice (each of the two seasons before this one).   Other guards currently in the league who have 2 first team selections include  * Paul George * Rondo * Jrue Holiday * Ben Simmons   The list of guards who’ve made more than 2 is  * Chris Paul  That’s it. So no I don’t think there are that many guards out there who have Smart’s skillset.
"I mean, fan favorite or not. Derozan clearly wasn’t going to be the one to get the Raptors to the Promised Land. That’s why most people at the time agreed with the trade from the Raps perspective, despite the risk.  The Jrue Holiday trade on the other hand wasn’t as kindly viewed by most. Just check the threads on this sub when it happened. It was viewed as an overpay and not enough to get the Bucks over the hump, but it still paid off. With Giannis yet to sign his extension, probably the bigger risk all things considered."
Was Jrue Holiday the best player in your team? He's not even the 2nd best LMAO.
"Jrue ""anustart"" Holiday"
Was the Jrue Holiday trade a crazy AF move then too? Both good regular season teams in non-traditional markets that gave up a lot in assets for a singular player to help get them over the hump without the guarantee a long-term contract. Jon Horst = Masai Ujiri
Your name is crazy too! Shoutout to Jrue Holiday!!
"The same arenas who called Kd the best player in the world? Jrue holiday/Draymond as well lol. You have to be a delusional Harden level Stan to think Kd doesn’t make others better, the Nets offense is literally better with Him than it is with harden. He literally almost knocked off the bucks by himself lol, Harden would lose in 5 games"

*The Man (KD) Inside Me* by Jrue Holiday and Tobias Funke
"It depends how you go about it.  What Philadelphia did was shameful and lazy. You shouldn't undersell your assets (Jrue Holiday) because they make you too good. You shouldn't treat multiple seasons an open try-out. You shouldn't have a plan to score the number 1 pick and think that'll save your franchise.   Having a one-two year plan of not ""being competitive"" is fine, but anything that requires more than two seasons to start being competitive is a shitty plan. And being competitive doesn't mean signing 30+ year old players or making win-now moves, it means trying to win with the core you have built and building the team off that."
Last time I cared about any accessories related to basketball was the season when they banned the ninja-style headbands that Jrue Holiday was rocking. Those were sweet.

"&gt;	his value as an elite transition player with playmaking and strong isolation defense.  His transition points obviously don’t translate in playoffs because teams limit that type of play. And his playmaking isn’t helpful when opponents sag off of him.                &gt;	He also should improve over the next 4 seasons, given a standard development curve.   Ben hasn’t really improved much outside of defense in the past 4 years. Expecting a standard development curve out of him at this point is just setting yourself up for disappointment.               &gt;	He is significantly more valuable than Jrue Holiday.  Significantly? Probably not.           &gt;	He is less of a player than James Harden, but he is much younger and locked into a contract he cannot escape from.  Alright, imma head out."
"On the Kings sub, most of us are thinking Jrue Holiday is his best case scenario.  Mitchell has offensive game and point guard skills."
You had me until “more valuable than Jrue Holiday”
"For a couple decades now every year offense gets better and defense gets worse. Last year the Mavs had the best offense of all time. Statistically that offense from the Mavs last year wouldn't have broken the top 5 this year and would be 8th best in the league. Regardless the point still stands, both Jrue Holiday and AD have multiple first team all defensive teams and the Pelicans were trash on defense. 1 or even 2 players can't carry a defense."
"3x all defensive team player. Matches Jrue Holiday.  Edit: although jrue had 2 first teams while pbev only had one, but still! I know ppl are pissed at him for his behavior but he played pretty well going up against guys like Donovan Mitchell and Dbook in the playoffs"
Kyrie or Westbrook or Jrue Holiday. So multiple time all-star.
"I'm conflicted - the lineup data with Simmons does indicate his value as an elite transition player with playmaking and strong isolation defense.  He also should improve over the next 4 seasons, given a standard development curve.  RPM data also puts him in the top 20 players, winshares, plus/minus, is all very similar.  On the other end, I have characterized him as a borderline all star before, which really means I can't figure out what he is or how impactful he is within the context of a championship offense.  The error bars on his actual value is the highest Ive seen in awhile.  We falsely characterized the 2011 heat mavericks finals as a breakdown on the part of lebron, when really it was at least 50% about the mavericks unusual zone lineup adjustments that didn't really have a counter until 5 out offenses became more predominant later in the 2010s.  Even then, it is clear that series might have played out differently if it was a best of 15 rather than best of 7.  I don't know what the fuck happened with Simmons during the hawks series.  You can point to individual plays, but the number of shots, his inability to be coached to throw the ball at the rim if he is within 5 feet and to see what happens, and the lack of any form of shot development is really odd.  Is he really just living off natural potential and is lazy off the floor?  Does he have an undiagnosed, untreated anxiety disorder and we are bashing him inappropriately?  Is Doc Rivers a toxic coach? Im not sure anymore.  What I do know is most casual fans are severely underrating him right now.  He is significantly more valuable than Jrue Holiday.  He is less of a player than James Harden, but he is much younger and locked into a contract he cannot escape from.  But I also don't know where he can go, because a player like Simmons shouldn't go to a rebuilding team in the modern era, because he does have championship equity...  And his hypothetical fit, even if the lineup data doesn't always agree, means he needs to go to a team with elite shooting.  The most obvious fit however, the warriors, already has Draymond Green and its extremely unclear whether these two players could play cooperatively next to each other or if their skill sets are not additive.  Basically the Simmons hate may or may not be warranted, but a player can't just move on when he feels like it when under a massive contract and the team he is on cant get something in return."
"It’s kind of like how jrue holiday probably isn’t worth all the draft picks and money in a vacuum, but he was 110% worth it for you guys. The heat need shooters and wasn’t going to find a better one for better money than Duncan."
The only time off the top of my head I really recall Dame shitting the bed was his series against the Pels where Jrue Holiday clamped him and the Pels trapped him
"Lol look at his comment below this too. Dude really just read the box scores, even if you watched zero games and were on Reddit you would know Holiday pretty much neutralized CP when assigned to him   Shit, you could listen to literally any podcast that covered the Finals for five minutes and know Jrue locked him up"
"Cmon man that last comment makes me feel like we watched a different Finals.    Jrue switched between CP and Booker from game to game as needed. When we needed CP neutralized, Jrue did a crazy job of forcing terrible passes that led to turnovers. The Suns needed the offense to run through him, and Jrue taking out his passing game was a big part of the end result being the way it was.    Conversely, when we needed Booker to cool off in key plays Jrue stepped up huge, most notably with a few massive steals in crunch time. Make no mistake, Jrue pretty thoroughly locked up whoever he was supposed to, those last 4 games especially. His shooting was pretty ass outside of game 5, but if we had a slightly less elite defender than Holiday we would’ve been fucked.   I get that this commenter has been an ass but his last few points on Jrue were pretty spot on."
"&gt; Id love him on the bucks ngl  Bro... Smart, Jrue Holiday and Giannis would be a defensive nightmare for any offense."
"That would be the high-upside risky #16 pick and the D-league throw in, yeah ? Milwaukee's anti-Process picks.  Jrue Holiday, Brooke Lopez, Pat Connaughton and Donte di Vincenzo plus two random old scorers and an offensively limited second round big get you 40 odd wins and into touching distance of #8 in the East."
"Norman Powell, Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, Hayward, Randle, Jarrett Allen, Hield, Norman Powell, etc you gotta overpay your key rotation guys a lot of the time, even if they're not your traditional superstars / All-Stars."
"i watched the entire thing at 6x speed. it's not THAT bad of a list  how is andre drummond #165? how is he above al horford, bradley beal, jrue holiday, john wall, KAT, brad daugherty? kevin love over yao ming? billups over reggie miller? moncrief over miller?"
"Dude don't let the hindsight and narratives fool you, Wolves made the right picks at the time, many warriors fans wanted Johnny Flynn too, as well as Brandon Jennings, Jrue Holiday, etc, and MANY were pissed off by the our pick.   You can look up the comments from back then."
"Tyrese Haliburton  Wendell Carter Jr.  Deni Avidja  As a Celtics fan... Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford and Payton Pritchard  I still believe in Markelle Fultz... he won't ever be a superstar in the strictest sense of the word or the best player in his draft class but he has a Jrue Holiday type ceiling  Jamal Murray I think his ceiling is a lot higher than probably most people think. I wanted the Celtics to draft him 3rd in his draft"
"Jrue Holiday &gt; Trae Young I was coming into the playoffs preaching this one, but Trae was so good in the playoffs that even tho Holiday won the title, I pretty much had to flip on my own take"
"I miss Eric Bledsoe on the Bucks...He was the best player for the HEAT in their bubble series, despite not playing for them. 9 games played in that years playoffs, 11 ppg on 39% shooting and 25% from 3. Def won us some games with that efficiency. Replacing Bledsoe with Jrue Holiday may go down as the 3rd best move in Bucks history, after drafting that Lou Alcindor guy (and keeping him away from the Harlem Globetrotters million dollar offer in 1969 money!! Thats 7.5 Million today) and drafting Giannis."
"Right? Like even when he had his best series against the blazers and finally got out of the first round, Jrue Holiday was the most impactful player on the floor cause he LOCKED Dame up that series."
Oh yeah I get it or like when everyone was saying Jrue Holiday is underrated which means he's not because everyone agrees.
"luka doncic, jrue holiday, jaylen brown, brandon ingram, anthony edwards, deandre ayton, SGA"
Fvv&gt;jrue holiday
"The 2004 team (the one you're talking about) was quite alright. Coincidentally, the one time the Wolves managed to put a decent supporting cast around him, KG won MVP and took the team to the WCF, losing to the Shaq and Kobe Lakers after Cassell got injured. But generally speaking, yeah those Wolves teams were *terrible*. Think about it, the best player KG played with on the Wolves was 35 yo Sam Cassell. It is the golden standard of ""great player weighted down by a bad team/org"".   And it is also why I find it somewhat funny when people say players like AD had to carry trash teams and that's why they left. I'm just left thinking, dude, KG would have *killed* to have someone as good as prime Jrue Holiday on his team, gtfoh. And it makes it all the more baffling that KG was as loyal as he was. It's the only reason people rate his that low and it sucks, but at least Wolves fans will always adore the man."
"Y’all got to clowning Bledsoe so much for not being Jrue Holiday, that y’all forgot he was actually better than Beverly smh"
"I lost $800 on a sports bet in the finals because Bud subbed Holiday in the game with 3 minutes left…when the Bucks were up 19  (I bet under 19.5 or something points for Jrue and he had 19, scored an easy bucket during garbage time which put him at 21, fml)"
"&gt; I didn’t see anything from This bucks team that makes me confidently say they could beat the 2019 Raptors.  That's fair - my argument really is that I think this Bucks team is better than the 2019 team (Eric Bledsoe -&gt; Jrue Holiday alone is a significant upgrade, and we unfortunately didn't get to see the improved Donte due to injury) and there's an argument that the series hinged on an extremely close Game 3, Bucks go 3-0 up and those later 6 point losses might be different.  &gt; Also another point, they’re a lot better because they had time to grow and their players improved. If the 2019 raptors had that same chance with Kawhi this wouldn’t even be a discussion.  Also fair - but it's against the framing of the question. It's specifically asking if the 2021 Bucks could beat the 2019 Raptors."
"Yeah, I'm not saying he wasn't a part of the issue, but he was frequently the only non-shooter on the floor. The spacing issues are massively overblown.   Ben obviously deserves some criticism, but boiling down losing multiple massive leads at home to one guy bring afraid to shoot is insanely silly.   The wasn't some foundational issue that made the Sixers lose, they just collectively sucked, especially down the stretch of games. Ben was afraid to shoot, Embiid was tired and either bricking or turning the ball over, Doc was running random full-bench lineups that hemorrhaged points, and Tobias Harris didn't step up whatsoever.   Ben gave Trae by far the most trouble of any defender in the playoffs, and that includes Jrue Holiday. Ben was also the best playmaker, and arguably the only meaningful playmaker the 6ers had.   The guy could've played better, but the lack of accountability for anyone else while dumping everything on Ben is nuts."
KD was listed at 225 for this years Olympics. Jrue Holiday was listed at 229 pounds despite the NBA having him at 205 pounds since like his rookie year Lol
"Can't argue with any of that. Well except being elite in everything except shooting. We know what elite in everything except shooting looks like in Giannis. Simmons is not great at finishing around the rim or getting to the basket at half court. And contrary to everyone else's opinion, I don't think he's a great playmaker. He's a good passer with great court vision and he makes good plays on the break. But playmaking to me, is well, making plays. When your team is having a hard time generating an offense, an elite playmaker will find a way. Like Luka or Trae does.  But I digress, I don't mean to come off too much like a simmons hater. We already have too many of those lol. I agree pretty much that this is more on the whole org than on simmons. I actually understand that simmons believes he's the player that he is and shouldn't be convinced to be another type of player. The team should have traded him before last year, or have completely built around their stars accordingly. I mean come on, trading for tobi and drafting thybulle?  Anyway, slight tangent. Since you mentioned it, i really hated those comments from philly fans that there is no way they would trade Ben for CJ. Sure Simmons SHOULD have more value, but his current stock is through the floor, and selling under market price to get a player like CJ is a good deal. Same for Brogdon. They use Jrue Holiday getting so much in exchange as comparison even though I would argue that Jrue is the better player. The only reason any team would pick simmons over jrue is potential, and we already know how much value Ben's potential really holds lol."
Happened to Jrue Holiday too. He came back with more tape study a bit better prepared.  I think the best defender on Luka is still Ben Simmons though. He's athletic and big enough to just bother the shit outta him. It'd be INTERESTING to see them in the same conference
Extreme dark horse: Jrue Holiday
Height means literal 0 when it comes to post defense. All about your base Robinson had great position and made Ben move exactly where he wanted him to and Ben had no moves in his bag to counter it. That’s why Marcus smart can guard the 1-5 in the paint and also jrue holiday guarding KD and kyrie look at certain possessions and you’ll see
"What does Jrue have to do with this dude lmao  Like what, you brought Jrue Holiday in a Joe Harris shooting thread"
"Does KD win with Middleton and Holiday if Giannis gets Kyrie and Harden? Your premise doesn't actually prove anything because it's not like it creates a fair playing field to compare them -- it creates an unfair one for KD because KD has another MVP on his team and Kyrie Irving, who most people would rate higher than Jrue or Middleton."
"Celtics have never had a great free agent superstar willingly sign since the big 3. Kyrie was traded to Cs and then lied and left. Al Horford was never that big of a star and they couldn’t retain him. Hayward was barely a star when he joined. The only guys staying are the Js who are coming off rookie deals. In all honesty, unless Jayson Tatum stays long term the Celtics are an organization with a storied past that may not be reflected in the future. Why would anyone willingly want to be based out of Boston?  Also the Pelicans, good lord, the sheer amount of talent New Orleans has had and to be this bad still. Once again, why would anyone logically choose the Pelicans of their own free will if they didn’t have other opportunities. Zion is already unhappy, how bad does an organization have to be to be to sour a relationship that quickly. The biggest signing was Jrue Holiday as a FA. Good lord, you look at the Spurs today, no one shits on them and yet there are already talks of “how will they ever find a rebuild”  Milwaukee and Denver have top 5 players and no FA is running to join them. How often did a superstar think of joining SAS big 3? Role player Pau? LMA? Market always wins, org is literally just “who is the least annoying”. Orgs thinking they are special..these stars make hundreds of millions of dollars, they’d rather have their own doctors."
Jrue Holiday is on a max extension
&gt;Jrue Holiday (1.3) — #50 in turnovers (2.2)  that's crazy
"If giannis and KD were exactly equal than ofc a healthy nets team would win in 4 or 5, they have harden and kyrie. Also, jrue holiday was not good against the nets."
"&gt;“House… I got another trade for you. Who says no.?Who says no? What am I saying? they both say no! but who hangs up first?! Marcus Smaht and either Scary Terry or the rights to Rasheed Wallace’s weird hair spot, for Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. What if we throw in Enis Kantah?”   *Proceeds to make a comment on Turkish politics that somehow references him being half-Italian.*"
"We never had a number 2 like Middleton, definitely never had a number 3 like Jrue Holiday, I just strongly strongly disagree"
1. Donovan Mitchell (1.3) - #27 in turnovers (2.8)  2. Jrue Holiday (1.3) — #50 in turnovers (2.2)  3. Khyri Thomas (1.2) — ? in turnovers (1.2) — only played 5 games  4. Jimmy Butler (1.2) — #51 in turnovers (2.1)  5. Russell Westbrook (1.2) — #1 in turnovers (4.8)  6. LaMelo Ball (1.2) — #25 in turnovers (2.8)
"the wrong personel moves, those matter and shape your career. So yes, Stan Van Gundy was the wrong hire for a young up and coming team. It would make more sense to get someoen to let them loose offensively, take advantage of the youth and atheticism, let them flourish offensively and then when they are ready to take that 1-4 seed step get a vet with those defensive principles.  then the lonzo situation.  Zion has gone a long way to praise lonzo and htey compliment each other perfectly. Lonzo is amazing in the transition, always looking to push the ball, perfect lob or p/r option for zion and then he fits zion as a playmaker as he can play the 3/d role, they just let him go, got another un proven rookie and a vet who has seen his best days behind him for jrue holiday.    they've jumbled up the surrounding him the right way and then in temrs of player health thats always a debate and a battle.  do i think zion is acting too soon? Sure, but pelicans have not done a good job of showin they are an organization that will build a winner for his unique talent opportunity.   so how can he show this? Not sign the extension, ti will cost him a good amount of money to take the qualifying offer nad then go on his way, if he chooses this route then its better for pelicans to get something rather than nothing.  Griffin was supposed to be a new culture and he was promising, but if you read the article the rest of the staff are not sold on his ways either.  they did this beforer him with AD and rondo too. they finally had playoff success, Rondo and AD sung praises of playing together and rondo even said hed look at a discount to stay and run it back but they never called him, replaed him with elfrid payton bc they looked at a box score or something and that was the final nail in the coffin for AD.    These guys careers are done in a flash, before you know it, and they are judged by wins in a team sport.  so the sense of urgency is there bc the status quo is changing."
A) Chris Paul  B) Mike Conley  C) Kyle Lowry  D) Jrue Holiday
"&gt;Your answer is just for small market teams to… be better.   Well obviously being better is good advice for anyone. But how about just ""don't be terrible"" as a standard to try to meet? Keep in mind, the Pelicans went years without a medical or training staff dedicated to the team, and they just fired a coach after one season. And that's before even getting to the stupid signings and trades they've made.   &gt; The truth is, large markets will always be able to draw way bigger talent   This is definitely an advantage that big markets have, but this doesn't mean small market teams are incapable of competing. There's really no substitute for great ownership and management, and big market teams definitely do not have a monopoly on that.   &gt;Most teams don’t get to turn Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, and a couple of draft picks for an MVP candidate  Two #2 overall picks, the #4 overall pick, two unprotected picks and two pick swaps is some kind of shit return now?  &gt; LeBron is already there because of the brand opportunity.    #1 the Lakers deserve all the credit for building that brand, and they did it through great ownership in Dr. Jerry Buss and great management in Jerry West, and they did this over decades. It didn't just magically appear. #2 the Lakers didn't just have ""brand opportunity"" they also had two max cap slots and the assets to trade for a third star. That's the kind of situation that is appealing to lots of players, even if the team isn't in LA.   &gt;Players don’t force their teams hands to leave for Milwaukee or Sacramento.   Like Jrue Holiday? He just wanted to go to a place where he could win, and after being traded from one small market in New Orleans to another in Milwaukee, he immediately signed an extension, and the reason is because the Bucks are run well.   My basic point is this: the Pelicans can't keep being poorly run and expect good players to want to play there. This is true for any team, even the Lakers. When Jim Buss was the Lakers' GM they were rejected by a whole slew of free agents and had Dwight Howard walk away in free agency. So even the Lakers can't expect to just get whomever they want if they're a poorly run team."
"Let me guess:  &gt;!Player A: Chris Paul!&lt;  &gt;!Player B: Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley!&lt;  &gt;!Player C: (I had to google for this one so no submission, got it wrong.)!&lt;  &gt;!Player D: Jrue Holiday!&lt;  &amp;#x200B;  My ranking before knowing who it is:  A, B, D, C  My ranking after knowing who it is:  A, D, C, B"
Guesses:  A: Someone  B: Kyle Lowry  C: Eric Bledsoe  D: Jrue Holiday
"And nobody used that rationale cause it leads to the complete prioritization of 3 and D players. For example, I’m pretty sure 90% of teams would take brook lopez over valancunis, Capela, Vucevic and co. Would you consider him a better player ? Most teams would take a jrue holiday, Malcolm brogdon or Kyle Lowry over Russ. Are they better players ? Just wanna see how consistent your logic is.  And white is a pretty average 3 point shooter."
"Paul George had 2 years left, he’s better than beal and it was a very specific situation with kawhi. And jrue holiday did not go for a massive package IMO."
"Jrue Holiday and Paul George aren't superstars either but had huge packages for them very recently. Beal was basically co-scoring-champ this year on very respectable 59 TS% (very good for this volume, and with Westbrook on the team.)   Assuming he says he'll re-sign with the team he's traded to, it will be a big deal for him."
"&gt;The players already have to sign with whatever team drafts them, and they have to wait five years before they'll have the first chance to exercise any freedom of choice to leave, and that's only if they're willing to forgo their first extension to do so.  You answered your own question. Now all Silver has to do is punish people who try to breach them.   Zion wants out? Okay, he loses his contract money and the league suspends him till it would have ended. Think he's gonna leave?  &gt;Face it, there are no ""rules"" that can be implemented to prevent players from being unhappy in certain situations. Players seem to be perfectly happy on some teams though, even small market ones like yours. Jrue Holiday didn't want to stay in New Orleans either, but was extremely willing to sign an extension in Milwaukee. No league intervention was necessary, he just needed to make his way to a competent team is all. Same as Zion. If the Pelicans want this shit to stop happening, then hire a competent GM and a competent coach and get a proper culture going there.   All completely off topic. Player's happiness is not why we have the draft."
"What ""rules""? [""You must be happy or else it's a fine""](https://i.imgur.com/ySnKvL8.jpg)?

Looked like Jrue Holiday or Gary Payton.
"&gt;I thought the Jrue trade was great.   It would have been if it had just been that straight up, but he made it instantly worse by folding in the Steven Adams deal along with it (especially since he was already taking back a negative contract in Bledsoe).   Here is what the actual trade wound up being from the Pels side:  * **Out:** Jrue Holiday, Sam Merrill, Zylan Cheatham, Joshia Gray, Darius Miller, Kenrich Williams, a 2023 2nd round draft pick and a 2024 2nd round draft pick   * **In:** Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 1st round picks, and swap rights on Milwaukee's 2024 &amp; 2026 1sts, which most likely won't be used (and now New Orleans has had to send out one of the picks they got from the Lakers in the AD trade just to get rid of Adams and Bledsoe)  So basically they traded Jrue, two 2nds and a bunch of random players and got back two late 1st round picks and two negative value contracts they had to attach a pick to to unload. That's not very good in the aggregate."
"You're selling Middleton, Jrue, and even Lopez short. When Giannis was down, his 2-4 options smacked the shit out of the Hawks for two games. Griffin is still okay but come on he has has been a shell of himself from the mid 2010s. Harris is a good shooter but nowhere close to the overall level of talent of Khris and Jrue. Giannis/Holiday/Middleton/Lopez is honestly not any worse than KD/Kyrie/Harris/Griffin"
Kyle Lowry &gt; Jrue Holiday in everything except defense and even in that category he's not far behind. Jrue's height and strength gives him the advantage in that category.
"Jrue honestly fucks the comparison all up by having an amazing regular season then struggling on that end in the playoffs. If we're talking regular season 2020-21 Jrue, he's better than most (not all) of Lowry's all-star years. *Especially* the back half of the season once he recovered from Covid and figured out the system. There were three starting point guards last season who had a .500+ FG% and 15 ppg; LeBron, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday. Remove the 15ppg requirement and the list is the same but Ben Simmons is there."
"All-star? How? If he stays in the East, is he going to beat Jrue Holiday for the spot next year? I doesn't even worth considering it in the West"
"Jrue Holiday wasn't the only move we made. PJ Tucker, Portis and Forbes were all amazing contributers that series."
Jrue Holiday was instrumental in completely locking down Damian Lilliard. Clint Capela alongside CP3 cost HOU the series against GS in 2019
"Giannis had Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday, both all star caliber level players. Granted no one expected Brook Lopez to turn back the clock"
I mean Jrue Holiday was the difference between the Bucks sweeping and losing in embarrassing fashion the previous year
"Joel Embiid is in the Giannis superstar class. He's a different sort of player, but if you took the gang of useless scrubs Joel has and put them around Giannis, then he also bounces out in the playoffs.  Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, Donte diVincenzo and  Pat Connaughton backing up Joel ? And Brook Lopez on the bench for when Joel needs to sit down ? Yeah, I can see them winning a championship."
"The problem with thinking like that is teams can get better faster than you think.  For example, the *first* player shopped in The Process was the final piece in the Bucks' championship winning team, who is also the player who would best compliment Joel Embiid right now - Jrue Holiday.  The future comes at you faster than you think, and crippling your team by paying a max to a non-shooting player who may not be able to finish a game is a mistake."
"We couldn’t even get guys to come play with Iverson.  You think keeping Evan Turner, Thad Young and Jrue Holiday was going to attract free agents?"
"his team played the third slowest pace in the league in 88, so adjusting for pace to the average in the league (about 100 poss per game, of which jordan played about 87.5 per game), and Jordan did the 2021 equivalent of posting 35/8.6/8.6 with 3 stls every game.  That'd put him 5th in assists, first in points, and 17th in boards per game, with almost double the steals of 5th place Jrue Holiday, and the same league adjusted TS% as Deandre Ayton."
"Sure, but when you also have Middleton and Giannis who can bring the ball up, it's not as essential to have true PG players on the roster. Which is why I didn't understand why they were playing Teague for the minutes they did. In some rotations he was on the court with Holiday, dispelling any theory that he was trying to rest Jrue. Bud being Bud, I guess."
"He hasn't had a good and healthy playoff run since 2017. He's better than ""most other players"" because he's a top 20 player in the league, but he is a worse and more unreliable playoff performer than other various players of similar caliber. He's also on a team that is loaded with iso talent already, and any possession where anyone is in isolation other than KD or Harden is a possession that probably shouldn't happen.  If you flipped him for Jrue Holiday straight up, the Nets' title chances improve and the Bucks' go down."
"He's more of a Jrue Holiday level facilitator though, in that he's a solid playmaker but if he's the main guy you are relying on to facilitate a half court offense, you're not going to have an elite offense. Jrue works so well now with the Bucks because both Giannis and Middleton are solid playmakers who can create for themselves and others as well."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
I mean in game 7 harden arguably had the most impact out of everyone not named KD and Giannis and that was with him having jrue holiday smothered on him all game. Imagine how much better he’d be able to help KD out against that cavs defense
Passes the eye test but doesn't put up great stats: Draymond Green or possibly Jrue Holiday(although his stats aren't exactly bad per se)
you have lebron and smart over Jrue holiday. what a joke lol
"You gonna mention a random role player and not NBA champion *Jrue Holiday*??  Hell, even Buddy Heild"
"Not concerned about the Raptors because that team doesn't exist, nor does a starting defensive 5 with that level of skill at all positions. Few teams in the league even have the defenders at the 4/5 to slow Giannis down.   Not concerned about the bubble Heat because that was a once in a century season during a global pandemic where the league adapted purely to make up some lost revenue. The Bucks were terrible in chemistry at that point and looked bad in the bubble, looked beatable against the Orlando Magic. Bud has made tons of adjustments on both sides of the ball now, and we run much more varied offense beyond the Giannis ISO that includes a new PG in Jrue Holiday. This is allowing Giannis to play off ball and to run pick and rolls interchangeably. Better role players too. Giannis has also expanded his offensive game and he's a better passer now too. Completely unfazed the ""Butler and the Heat"" after sweeping them. I'm not really worried about any team in the East defensively at this point. The greater concern for the Bucks will be getting stops on defense and limiting the super powered Nets offense. I think if teams are expecting run and dunk man they will be in for a surprise. And I imagine all teams have scouting reports a bit deeper than ""run and dunk"" man and the memes that the nephews post here. They are probably not focusing on the bubble playoffs, but how to scheme with the personnel they have."
For a big men al horford. Hes been a simple yet effective and winning player his whole career. He can pop out and hit a 3 or start the offense at the top of the key or in the post. He knows how to move his feet so he rarely gets cooked on switches and is strong enough to handle most guys in the league. I think hes a great guy to look at since hes not an uber athletic/skilled center but still more than gets the job done. For wings id say gordan hayward plays basketball like every coaches dream just a shame hes never healthy. He almost always makes the right play and doesnt have any holes in his game. Shooting guards it has to be klay. A sniper that gets his looks moving off ball and is a pest on defense. And for pgs kyle lowry. Lowry is small and hasnt always been an amazing player but hes gotten better every year and has really made himself to be one of the most effective guards in the league at both ends. For guys a little taller jrue holiday.   Tldr: guys that play both ends and dont force it on offense
"are you just picking players that are versatile? Jrue Holiday is the guy most guards don't like playing against.  edit: and definitely not top 5 or even top 30, but James Harden is decent on guarding bigs when there's a switch."
"I'm agreeing with you, and Jrue Holiday is ranked at 6 (way above Simmons)."
"&gt; the Hawks were 1-1 against the Bucks with both healthy.  Sure, and for all we know the Bucks win the next 3 and take that series 4-1, they were massive favorites after all and crushed them in Game 2 and made Trae have his worst game of the playoffs. We saw the power of Jrue Holiday in the playoffs defensively, does anybody really think it was going to get *better* for the Hawks as that series went on?   &gt; they also beat a very good Sixers team. the best team Celtics 18 beat was a mediocre raw Sixers team.  Conveniently ignoring that the Hawks had their best player for this series and won in 7 games I might add, whilst the Celtics won in 5 despite missing Kyrie and Hayward.   The overarching point that I'm trying to make that you're ignoring by trying to argue semantics here is that what happened in last year's playoffs is irrelevant as far as predicting what will happen in the next year."
"Mike Conley  Patty Mills  Jrue Holiday  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Boban Marjanovic  Is your list a joke OP? Derrick Rose said some kind of messed up stuff at a trial, Steven Adams has been voted one of the dirtiest players in the league, Bobby Portis punched a teammate, and a lot of people don't like how much Luka Doncic complains about calls."

"Middleton is a great #2, and one of the reasons why they won this year was by having one of the best #3s (Jrue Holiday) in the past few years."

"I think its a stretch to say that hes better than jamal murray and jrue holiday RIGHT NOW, those guys are proven and have performed at the highest levels, but i feel like a lot of nephews here saying that hes the worst out of the players you listed are only saying that because they either a. dont watch the grizzlies whatsoever so they have no frame of reference or b. they only watch his highlights, assume that people think hes good only because his highlights are flashy, and convince themselves they are basketball analysts because they somehow ""know"" he doesnt have advanced stats numbers that matchup with the flair he has for the game.   People that actually watch games and grizzlies fans know that ja is special, and I would even go as far to say i think he will have a better career and be a better player than zion. Ja was the spoon that stirred the drink for memphis this season, and actually led his team to a playoff berth. Furthermore, along with zion, hes one of the most efficient players to come out of college since the likes of lebron james, steph curry, and anthony davis.    Yea he is still young, but put some respect on the guys name. De aaron fox is good, but I dont think he is on the level morant is even now, never mind in the future."

KPJ can drop 50 while being guarded by Jrue Holiday. Highway robbery my ass.
"Kpj, the starting pg who just averaged 16-6 in his first season and dropped 50-11 on jrue holiday and khris middleton? For ben Simmons? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
100%. Our defensive rating without Rudy that series was like 135 or some shit. There’s not a damn thing Jrue Holiday is gonna do about that.
"&gt;Playoff rondo, jrue holiday, Mirotic, AD, prime boogie  Mirotic doesn’t belong in that group. But I agree with your point."
"If had if stayed healthy I honestly think they could of gone 6 games at least with GS. Playoff rondo, jrue holiday, Mirotic, AD, prime boogie. That’s a nasty lineup"
Give me jrue holiday as a defender over anyone in the league
Jrue Holiday plays better defense than Giannis but Giannis is the only one of the 2 that has a shot at winning next seasons DPOTY. The award goes to the dominate bigs.
Lmao stop and be objective for a minute man. When people say he didn’t have help we mean relative to the competition. Having Kyrie half the series is not the same as having Khris Middleton for the whole series. Blake Griffin is not comparable to Jrue Holiday. Bruce Brown and fucking Jeff Green going off in one of the four games he was healthy enough to play in is not comparable to Brook or PJ lol. They were so desperate they let Harden play absolutely terribly on one leg for 4 games for crying out loud. Like try and be objective for a second. That is not a good supporting cast.
Damian is a beast on offense but Jrue Holiday got the starting position over him on the Olympic team. Defense = Wins
They kept bargain shopping for player no other teams were particularly high on.  They never made their Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler trade(Bulls-Wolves trade) where they had to give up actual value for someone that could raise their ceiling.
Damian Lillard is an Amazing PG. He averaged 34 PPG and 10 APG in the playoffs last year. Why did Jrue Holiday start at PG for the Olympic team over Lillard? Is it because defense equals wins?
Is Jrue Holiday just a joke to you?
Jrue Holiday
"Jrue Holiday  NOP: Usage 23.1-28.9, TS% 50.5-55.5  MIL: Usage 22.2, TS% 59.2"
"I mean, if Jrue Holiday can’t win it, I can’t see any other PG/undersized guard winning it in the modern day."
"Giannis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton and Paul George/Bradley Beal/Donovan Mitchell/Klay Thompson would be favorites there dude. They would have better shooting and defense pretty handily, and could play great zone with Giannis and Brook Lopez to force shots from the nets"
"You'd need Jrue Holiday-level defense from Simmons to justify his piss poor performance when his team needed him. And spoiler, he ain't even close."
How about the point guard of the champions Jrue Holiday???
"Idk i dont think they get the full 3 picks for him. I think 2 is okay.     Jrue holiday got 3 1st round picks right?? I think id still rather have jrue than ben on any given team, dude plays allstar defense and can score in the playoffs.     Id be fine with 2 firsts, beasley, and prince and i think thats fair."
Jrue Holiday has a long history of injuries.
Just clone Jrue Holiday and tell him don't be terrible on offense half the time
"The list of people who they have ranked as worse prospects than Elfrid is pretty epic. Embiid, Giannis, Paul George, Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Rudy Gobert, Bradley Beal, it just goes on and on and on, lol."
"Oh okay, they were just saying that Elfrid was going to be better than Blake, Giannis, Embiid, Paul George, Jrue Holiday etc. Much better."
Jrue holiday
&gt;He didn’t do enough to be a reliable first option on the playoffs   Just like your guy up in Portland. Oh Wait- Melo actually almost went to the finals and went toe to toe with peak Mamba while Lillard got swept by Jrue Holiday
"KD, Lebron, Harden, and Curry are definitely better than AD, but I don't think you can make a case for Westbrook and Lilliard as easily.  For one thing, AD beat Lilliard in the playoffs when they faced each other and Westbrook never carried a team past the first round as the #1 guy, and lost several bad series when he was paired up with another star.  AD has had worse teams around him than both of them, the best player he's been with is 1 time All Star Jrue Holiday, or a single healthy season of Demarcus Cousins, or Rondo.  Lilliard has had CJ with him for basically his entire tenure, and Westbrook has played with KD, Harden, and PG13."
Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday.
"Saying OG is a ""way better defender"" is like saying Rudy Gobert is a better defender than Jrue Holiday. It makes no sense because they play completely different positions. Lonzo's shooting gets better every season too.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm taking Lonzo over OG"
"Klay Thompson, CP3, Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Trae young, and more are ALL &gt; Westbrook"
"Chris Paul  Smart/Schroder  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons   Kyle Lowry  Harden (or Kyrie)  Lonzo  Conley  Dejounte Murray  Devonte' Graham  Jamal Murray  Patrick Beverley  Brogdon  Rubio  Terry Rozier (or LaMelo)  Lillard  Westbrook  Luka  Sexton  who here is Curry objectively a better defender than?  because if he's not better than at least 4 or 5 of them, he is below average.  that is how average works lol"
"This is my hottest take I guess but I don’t think KD was undoubtedly the best player on the floor, he and Giannis were roughly equal.  KD *looked* better because he was hard carrying and taking all the shots while the Bucks were still playing team ball and that’s what people focus on but the results were very similar. People also *wildly* overrate the disparity in support casts because KD was doing so much and the Bucks should have been much better on paper, but again as far as actual performance goes there wasn’t a big difference.   We had two bench players play themselves out of the rotation because they were so bad while also missing a starter, it was Lopez’ worst matchup and consequently worst series of the playoffs, Holiday played great defence but he was doing it on an injured James Harden who wasn’t doing much anyway while he put up Bledsoe-tier shooting splits, and Middleton disappeared every time we played in Brooklyn.  On paper Jrue/Middleton/PJ/Lopez/Portis/Connaughton takes the fattest shit on the cast KD had around him, but all those dudes fuckin sucked and while KD’s cast certainly didn’t turn into world beaters they played alright. And in the one game KD actually won without Kyrie he had Jeff Green and Blake Griffin absolutely turning into world beaters for the night.  Giannis carried the fuck out of the Bucks in that series, it’s no coincidence the one actually bad game he had we lost by 40. But in the modern NBA nobody gets credit for a carry job if they’re not spending half the game isoing at the top of the key and their support cast still looks ok on paper."
"Curry faced every single 1st team All NBA player in 2015. AD, Gasol, LeBron and Harden. Just because he didn't face Jrue Holiday or Mike Conley doesn't mean he had an easy ring lol"
The bucks adding jrue holiday was a mere fluke too
"I think it’s important to think like 5-6 years down the line. Say OKC hits on a top pick (I.e Chet Holmgren) and they become a perennial threat in the west once again. Could anyone possibly imagine Sportscenter, First Take, etc. running segments still discussing whether it was the right move and whether it was bad for basketball? There’s no way it would happen, I can’t see a scenario where they get scolded for this strategy no matter what. But 7 years later, despite the fact that tanking gave several low picks chances to become key players in the NBA and landing large contracts (Jerami Grant, Covington, TJ McConnell, etc), it is still discussed seemingly once a week about how the sixers method was a disgrace. It seems like it does really just come down to the market, as for a half decade prior to The Process, the sixers were completely irrelevant and no one gave them a second thought, but for some reason trading Evan Turner and Jrue Holiday from an 8th seeded team sparked a decade long debate.  I guess time will tell years from now about how the media will respond when the thunder picks are said and done, but both teams imo handled their respective situations the right way. The sixers had the Andrew Bynum debacle, and the only way out of that seemed to be to restart, meanwhile OKC lost several MVPs and had to do the same. They’re similar situations but it seems there’s no doubt media market size plays a large role."
"Like most of the starting lineup. KD himself will tell you all about how much he hates dealing with Jrue Holiday despite the size difference, meanwhile we were wasting him on a one-legged James Harden.  It’s not like PJ played bad defence, he didn’t. It was good. It just didn’t matter, because KD is one of the greatest scorers the world has ever seen and poured it in anyway. We have plenty of guys who can have jumpers hit in their face all day."
"So the bucks didn’t improve as a team ? They added jrue holiday, bryn forbes, and portis meanwhile the heat lost Ariza and oladipo was hurt. Let’s not act obtuse the bucks were a much better team than the year prior"
"Sure, but 2 seasons is still a better sample than 5 so it’ll take a while for those assessments to be incorrect.  And while I wouldn’t say the Pelicans have the most dire future, the constant questions regarding Zion definitely play a role in that. Between the constant rumours that he wants out, him being reported at a pretty absurd weight, being injury prone, etc.  And you gotta admit David griffin has made some questionable decisions over his time with the pels so far. The AD trade was great, y’all had little leverage but still got a haul for a disgruntled star entering the last year of his deal. That big jrue holiday trade? Meh. Y’all got Bledsoe Adams and 2 picks from a contender. Bledsoe and Adams were awful fits with the team even before they played together, and the team then extended Adams on an overpay of a contract before seeing them play together. Then he traded both of those bad contracts with a pick to move down in the draft and get valancunis, who also doesn’t fit at all with Zion. Jaxon Hayes seems like a whiff with a top ten pick and I’m sure either Darius Garland or Deandre Hunter would’ve been better than him + NAW, and you had that pick in the first place. Then you let Lonzo go, who’s become pretty much the perfect role playing point guard with room to grow and was close with Zion.   Far from the most dire future but plenty of questionable decisions that will naturally draw scrutiny"
He said everything he needed to with the return he got for Jrue Holiday. Even when you consider the leg injury Hinkie hid from New Orleans.
"The difference is that the Thunder weren't actively selling assets at a loss or making picks that left even casuals wondering the hell they were doing. Look at the return the Sixers got for Jrue Holiday. Look at them walking out of 3 straight top-6 picks with Noel, Embiid, and Okafor. Plus Presti has a proven track record at drafting with KD, Westbrook, and Harden."
"Griffin really destroyed that team. Had a backcourt of Zo and Jrue Holiday, Ingram who was already capable of 20ppg, Zion, and an enormous amount of first rounders and cap space. Every subsequent move after was almost a worst case scenario of how to build and manage a roster."
"The future comes at you faster than you think.  Jrue Holiday was shipped out of Philly to start the Process, and he helped Milwaukee win the championship."
Justin Holiday is easy if you know what Jrue looks like. Imagine a 10% vertically stretched Jrue Holiday and you're basically there.
Last year I asked the same question and Pelicans fans said Lonzo is not a fit because his shot is not good and his defense is questionable. So they essentially went from Jrue Holiday + Lonzo to just Lonzo to now Graham. This kind of tells you how well Griffin is doing.
"I get what you're saying, but if you choose ""ingram for 33m"" does that mean you have to give up 33m of contracts? If a bucks fan says they want ingram, is that implying theyre willing to give up jrue holiday or middleton for ingram?"
"Bobby Portis and Semi Ojeleye are back tonight and will be playing; think that just leaves Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday and Donte DiVincenzo on the injury list."
"They got one more first round pick than Jrue Holiday got.  These firsts are all fools gold. There's a very decent chance not a single one of them is in the top 10. People just list them out like ""14 in 7 yrs"" as if it means something. They didnt get Allen and LeVert....they dumped them. That's on them that's not part of the return these are just rationalizations. KPJ has nothing to do with the Rockets deal and ignoring the real reason why he was available for nothing is hilarious. This deal did exactly what Tillman wanted to do.....sell false hope, sell picks that sound way better than they were and kick the can down the road. Deflect from any real expectations. By the time all thse picks can be evaluated and people can see how bad they are itll be like 2027 and people will have moved on no one will care anymore. Mission accomplished."
"ESPN had AD ranked as the #2 player before the 2020-21 season, ahead of Giannis. Embiid was #14 behind Bam. Davis has always been an overhyped Robin and Embiid was a goofy Batman that people really just started taking seriously last year.  If you consider Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons to be roughly equivalent players, then it’s clear to see how much more Embiid has accomplished with PHI than AD did with NOLA"
"The trade tree for that deal might say otherwise. The Denver 2nd (57) was part of the trade back from 4 which lead to its own plethora of assets.       The Washington 2nd in 2020 was converted into Utah's 2nd next year.        The Milwaukee 2nd in 2020 was sent back into the Jrue Holiday trade.       The Washington 2nd in 2021 turned into a Blazers 2nd in 2026.       If you put together the trade trees of Davis, Mirotic, and Jrue, it becomes absolutely massive with plenty of overlapping pieces."
Jrue Holiday is also an incredible person.
"Well. Yeah. When Jrue Holiday, a 6”4 guard is 3 blocks away from being 4th all time in franchise history, your franchise is unestablished."
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
First question on Middleton’s AMA: “Do you and Jrue Holiday scissor?”
Jrue Holiday rules I'd go on dates with him too
Your defence didn't cause D'lo to turn it over every time he touched the ball. Graham ain't Jrue Holiday blood.
well i mean as a pelicans fan i think it's only right to say jrue holiday. but generally speaking though i've always loved roses game. prime or not his moves are always just so cool to watch
Jrue Holiday
"“Broken sixers” lmao way to discredit their entire team cuz simmons didnt dunk. Simmons still has elite d and they have thybulle. And did you forget there was a Bucks series in which they have khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday? Im not aware we only went against the Knicks! Forgot about 2 other series with elite defensive teams. Oh shit wait thats Ja, only one playoff series in a gentleman’s sweep.    Lemme discredit the jazz by saying rudy go ert a scrub he broken"
"Exactly. At one point Otto Porter Jr (got a max RFA offer sheet) was being paid a higher salary than John Wall and Bradley Beal while on the same team. But somehow the ""others"" are being screwed over in this system... lol  Giannis is only making about $5-10mil more per year than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. He is drastically underpaid bc his salary is capped by the CBA"
My lineup of these players would be this:  PG: Ben Simmons and Steph Curry(pretty obvious)  SG: James Harden and Jrue Holiday(Again pretty obvious)  SF: LeBron James and Kevin Durant(maybe the most and least ball dominant superstars)   PF: Kristaps Porzingis and Zion(Guy who is 7 foot but only takes jumpers vs. guy who isn't but scores everything at the rim)  C: Jokic and Embiid(Great playmaker meh defender vs. great defender meh playmaker)
"Jrue Holiday, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Karl Malone, Robinson for his Navy background would be my choices. Kawhi from LA i know he’d piece up golden boy from akron"
"The bucks, Middleton &gt; lowry, holiday &gt;&gt;&gt; siakam kyle lowry was at the end of his prime and is only better than Middleton at playmaking and I don't think siakam can be a second option but we know jrue can because of his time in New Orleans"
Lol what did Jrue Holiday ever do in New Orleans?  The team looks stacked because they have a 2 time MVP
"You can think about this two ways imo. Who has the highest ceiling? Mobley. But Barnes is with a much better development team which gives him a better chance of reaching that absolute ceiling in my opinion. So while Mobley arguably has slightly more potential, I can see Barnes having the better career.  Suggs is nice but I don’t think he’ll be a perennial all-star. Jrue Holiday type build."
Makes me glad the most notable moment in his career to this point is getting punked by Jrue Holiday
"Kawhi Leonard is 30, Simmons is already 25. Plus, Simmons is an objectively worse defender than Rudy Goebert, who’s 29. Simmons also averages less than 1 block per game at 6 foot 10.   He has quick hands and feet but doesn’t noticeably slow down great offensive players the  way Lu Dort, who’s 22 years old, Jrue Holiday, whose 31 years old, or even Davion Mitchell at 23 years old do."
"When Top 75 players of all time like Anthony Davis can't consistently lead their team into the playoffs as the guy, playing with NBA champions like Jrue Holiday, who is Jimmy Butler to be criticized for one really bad playoff series when he's never been on a sub .500 team, even when playing with questionable rosters?"
"&gt; On ball defenders don't really bother Curry  There are definitely a few defenders who bother Steph more than others. Especially ones that are smart, physical, and have the reputation with referees to get away with more contact (like Jrue Holiday). Though when he's on, even the best defenders feel helpless. Steph (and Warriors ball in general) also has a tendency to commit more turnovers with all the complicated ball/player movement (as well as Steph liking to get creative to enjoy the game, which ends up backfiring at times), which can be taken advantage of. I watched Dort guard Steph last season and Steph didn't seem to be bothered much, but the Thunder had a crap roster and were tanking. In any case, it'll be interesting to see how Dort handles guarding Steph this season, and obviously I'm excited to see what Davion Mitchell can do as a rookie."
Dionte Christmas  Pretty sure him and Jrue Holiday played on the Sixers together
Yeah they definitely weren’t helping in the post but were totally collapsing on Jrue Holiday. Jesus christ this sub
"1.TJ Warren  has always been known to be a ""random scorer"" i say this as someone who has followed His career since he was with the suns 2. PG has always been bad in the Playoffs post injury he hasn't done well except last postseason not to mention that Clippers team was simply outmatched by the Nuggets (you know what matchups are like yes?) Trez is an undersized Big both Murray and Jokic bullied not just PG but the whole clippers team including Kawhi last Playoofs PG had someone to bounce off him And take the pressure Reggie Jackson was an underrated signing that turned out well for them  and the addition of versatile players like Nic Batum And Ibaka did wonders for them   3. The Heat made the finals that year because they were one of the favourites everyone knew that any of the Bucks  Heat and maybe even The Celtics or  76ers would make a competitive run for the finals once the bucks was out of the Picture the east was wide open for the taking and once again this was a matchup advantage for the Heat Against the Bucks Bledsoe was unsurprisingly disappointing in the playoofs and  Giannis struggled against The Heat not to mention Middleton was the only legit shooter they had Everyone else struggled to shoot which meant Giannis struggled to Drive and kick the heat lost this year because The Bucks actually had a legit good player in Jrue Holiday and they revamped their roster not to mention the heat struggled with health issues through the season With a lot of their players catching Covid Butler was awful but that was only because the Bucks actually had a better roster similar to how the Clippers managed to make a Run to the WFC because of a better roster... It's not rocket science my dude 4.The suns  namely Booker Ayton and Bridges always had potential they only needed one missing piece and that piece was CP3 it's no coincidence CP3 wanted to be traded to the suns He saw what they had if  anything  that bubble run by the suns was foreshadowing of what They could do with a Veteran precence that could also playmake Ricky Rubio obviously wasn't gonna cut it... Not only that they also had Monty Williams they actually had a legit coach in the bubble and the suns this year we saw what they could With A legit coach in Monty Williams And a Vet precence in CP3 and Cp3 has always been one of the best PG's in the league so the bubble run was a foreshadowing of what Booker and Ayton could tho with a legit Point Guard lol and here i thought everyone already knew this"
"&gt; Jrue Holiday looked like **the** star player.  That's implying Jrue looked like the only star on the team, which is ridiculous. Jrue played like an All-NBA player that series. AD played like an MVP."
The disrespect to Jrue Holiday!
"You mean the Jrue Holiday that was always injured around AD? the Randle that wasn’t good until season 2 in New York? The Christian Wood who’s not really all that anyway? Plus most of the time his supporting cast was injured, like Eric Gordon, Tyreke Evans and Ryan Anderson when they were actually good."
&gt; the one series I watched Jrue Holiday looked like the star player  Yeah AD was ass that series.  33-12-1-2-3 on 65 TS% and shutting down the Dame PnR with his high traps. So garbage.
"Dame's also made the playoffs every year as a number 1 option on his small market team, AD led his team to the playoffs twice (once also to get swept), acting like 4 games makes a difference between the two is peak reddit bad faith arguing. Also Jrue Holiday won the Pels that series not AD. AD has certainly not done more than Dame other than prove he can't lead a team and bail to go play second fiddle to Bron. Acting like him winning the bubble title makes him automatically better is hilarious   Dame easily walks to a title playing with Lebron too"
DeMarcus Cousins when healthy is bounds ahead of Jrue Holiday. Are you serious?
I tried to watch the Pels playoffs back in the AD era and the one series I watched Jrue Holiday looked like the star player. Absolutely pooped on McCollum and Lillard.
"Klay is an above average defender and one of the most efficient shooters in NBA history. I don't think anyone says Klay is a ""historically"" good defender.    But how many guards that made the all defensive list this past decade would you elect to sign over Klay Thompson?  A list that's basically voted on by reporters who read player stat sheets and vote based on blocks and steals.  Chris Paul sure...arguably Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler..  But how about Matisse Thybulle?  Tony Allen?  Patrick Beverley?  Eric Bledsoe?  How about Ben ""Lebron 2.0"" Simmons who defers a layup in the playoffs?  You want Oladipo or Roberson instead?  John Wall?!?  And how is John Stockton a 3 &amp; D player at all?  A 38% 3fg shooter that averaged less than 2 attempts per game compared to Klays 42% on 7 attempts per game?"
"Unpopular but Embiid can end up top 15 along with Durant/Curry/Giannis. Imo he is on the cusp of an MVP/DPOY year... he just needs the 6ers to place in a high seed and stay out of injury trouble to properly get recognized.    People are sleeping too hard on the 6ers, and imo that includes Morey. Trading Simmons for a non-all star PG absolutely moves the needle for them, Morey is full of shit. If Jrue Holiday (1x all star in 2013... barely counts) was the 6ers PG, that's a championship contender easily. Lowry is an all star but he's barely a top 10 PG, and he would've been plenty enough to make the 6ers a contender too. Both of those guys were available.   If the 6ers trade Simmons, imo I could see them winning the chip this year and they are running it back with the same squad next year... Embiid could be looking at 2+ rings before he retires. If he does that including MVPs and DPOYs, FMVPs... his ceiling is def top 15.  1st tier  Jordan Lebron Kareem  2nd tier  Bird Magic Wilt Russell   3rd tier  Shaq Kobe Hakeem Duncan  4th tier  Curry Durant Giannis Embiid   That would be top 15 all time, so Embiid's ceiling is in that 4th tier."
People forget AD was stuck on that dumpster fire of a franchise in NO and still swept the blazers without his second best player while dame in that series got out played by jrue holiday. Like come on man make it make sense🤦🏽‍♂️.
"Jrue Holiday is a better player than CJ McCollum. Not sure what this discussion has turned into, this is a top 75 list not a 1-75 list and both of them made it."
"Heat fans celebrating like they won the chip after beating the Bucks in a regular season game without Jrue Holiday, Brook Lopez, Donte, Bobby Portis, Semi, and Rodney Hood 😭😭"
Ahhh I watched every game and Jrue Holiday played one of the best series from a defensive standpoint I’ve ever seen. Obviously AD was there but Jrue deserves most of the credit for locking up Dame
"You’re acting like Jrue holiday and Khris Middleton are role players and aren’t stars. Your point basically proves moreys point. And yes we don’t need another super star but we need another star pg who can distribute and shit create. What role players do we need? We are stacked on role players. We have a very solid bench. Korkmaz, Isaiah Joe, Andre Drummond, Niang, Thybulle. Thybulle and Drummond provide good defense. Drummond provides good rebounding. They are all solid at defending. Korkmaz brings the shot creation and ball distribution, Joe and Niang are very good catch and shoot players. And then in our starting lineup we have three very solid role players, Curry, Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey. So which role players do you propose that make us into a title contender huh? 1-2 solid role players and we are just pushing out players like Joe and Maxey who are developing very nicely. The fact is we need another 20+ ppg player who can be relied upon on the perimeter in the fourth"
"Just Jrue Holiday/Rondo things, not to mention peak DeMarcuse Cousins and AD"
Jrue Holiday  Cuz Mccolum   OG annouby  Bam  Jokic
PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Mikal Bridges  SF: Tobias Harris  PF: Draymond Green  C: Nikola Jokic  This team can switch on anyone for defense and almost everyone is a spot up shooter.
Jrue Holiday  CJ McCollum  Mikal Bridges  Draymond Green  Nikola Jokic
AD didn’t sweep Dame—the Pelicans did… and he wasn’t even the best player in that series—Jrue Holiday was.
"Do it in the playoffs, then talk. [Until then...](https://www.mykhel.com/img/2021/10/jrue-holiday-21-khris-middleton-22-and-giannis-antetokounmpo-34_xsmpvvvivhjf1tpiz7v8avwkw.png)"
Jrue Holiday could never do what Murray did offensively
He had jrue Holiday
"My favorite thing about the playoffs was the flip flop every other game on Middleton and Holiday. First it’s Middleton and “Jrue Bledsoe” are overpaid, then it’s two all star caliber players the next game. People just shift it to fit their narratives."
Jrue Holiday is not a role player. He’s a great pg in the league and extremely underrated. Almost any team in the league would want him.  I’m sure if they were able to trade for him they would do that in a heartbeat but none of the trades that have been “proposed” include a player on his level.   Morey even said today the only trade offers are for role players.
"Jrue Holiday is very very important, and he's not playing"
MIL got Jrue Holiday. The exact type of player the sixers need. I would love if we could follow that plan. We got shooters if that’s your point but we need a point guard that can hold it down if we want a chance.
As the number one option on their team dame has made the playoffs every year since his rookie year while AD made it twice in 7 years. Jrue holiday is also better than any player dame has played with since Aldridge in 2015.
"So a couple things:   1. Time is lost by waiting.  Obviously not a day or a week, but if the season goes by without a trade, that is a lost year and Embiid, while enormously talented, is not a star player I would be patient building a team around.  He has very serious injury considerations that could limit the Sixers window.     2, The other thing that is lost is Simmons' potential fitness.  There have been guys who if they've been away from the game a certain period of time, they show back up out of shape and may not be the same player.  After the 98 lockout, Shawn Kemp gained a ton of weight and was never really the same.  Dennis Scott too, fwiw.     3. The alternative is not peanuts.  If Lillard doesn't want to be moved, its not like the alternative is just to trade Ben for some second round picks.  Other teams have younger players with some upside who could fit well with Embiid. If the Spurs for example offered Derrick White, Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson for Simmons and Curry, that seems like a good match.  Sure none of them are all stars but they could fit very well with the Sixers as it stands. And that dovetails into my last point:     4. The Bucks just proved you don't need a 'superteam' to win the championship.  They won it with an MVP player and other rotational players that fit very well with Giannis, and then they went out and got Jrue Holiday without giving up a whole lot in terms of talented players.  They got him with mostly draft picks.  So getting rotation players that fit with Embiid doesn't foreclose on the Sixers chip hopes."
"Warriors faced the Pelicans without Jrue Holiday, Grizzlies without Conley and Tony Allen (series was tied 2-2 before Allen went down), Houston was missing Patrick Beverly (lol ok ok), Cleveland didn't have Love and Kyrie.  Yeah, I'd say they benefited from their opponents missed games."
jrue holiday  jklay thompson  jandrew wiggins  jraymond green  joel embiid
"Thats BS speculation. Even if those players were 100% healthy you have no way of knowing they would beat or finish higher than the Suns. Coulda, woulda, shoulda.  Nets fans do the same thing, if we only had Harden or Kyrie ... They had KD and Harden a couple nights ago and the Bucks stomped them into the ground. Two top 75 players of all time at 100% and they still can't beat the Bucks.  On paper that game shouldn't have been close, Nets should have crushed them. Instead they lost by 23 in a game that Jrue Holiday only played 17 mins."
"The NBA is an exhibition league for individuals. The team has a very short history of (since replaced) cheap ownership or completely catering to individual players who feel and act above the team. That's not what the people of the area will buy into. It has nothing to do with the Pelicans but everything to do with the who has come in and out of its doors and the way the NBA is. Ask any Pelicans fan about Jrue Holiday. People love Jrue. He always played hard, he and his wife bought into the city and area and played for something more than themselves and he is the most loved player in the short history of the Pels. The organization hasn't put together that group who buys in and represents the team and city over individuals like Memphis was able to with Grit n Grind. It's not representative of the culture of the city and state. Its why they haven't completely bought into Zion either. The way reporting around him has been they need to baby him, keep him happy, do everything for him to keep him in New Orleans. That doesn't vibe with the people down there when he hasn't shown the same towards the city and organization."
Are there any better role players you can ask for than jrue holiday and Evan fournier
"2011-12 Sixers: Jrue Holiday, Jodie Meeks, Andre Iguoadala, Thad Young, Elton Brand  Without Ben, that might be an interesting matchup. Embiid has his way with Elton obv, but it’d be a watchable series."
How you gonna talk about not knowing basketball and then saying every PG sucks horribly at defense except two games and have Avery Bradley of Jrue fuckin Holiday
"It’s 1.5% TS gap, which paired with the point gap is decent. Not substantial but that’s comparable to the difference between say, Julius Randle and Devin Booker in terms of scoring numbers.   I was referring to stats like raptor with the lack of public explanation. BPM just doesn’t mean much cause it focuses solely on box stats. VORP is based on BPM with a few other factors. Box stats have little correlation with actual impact so it’s a flawed premise that creates a flawed stat with little use. RPM is the best of those stats based on its premise but it’s flawed. RPM suggests dame is substantially more impactful than jrue holiday is defensively for example.   I don’t think Garland is that much better than RJ, I’d like have them both in my 70-80 player range. I just think he’s better. He has edges as a scorer too, that matters more than the rebounding differential since rebounding doesn’t matter. It’s essentially the playmaking vs defence gap.   And no I said garlands playmaking edge shouldn’t be dismissed simply because of his position. Likewise Barrett’s defensive edge shouldn’t be dismissed because of his physical advantages. Their games and skills speak for themselves"
Man. What about Jrue Holiday averaging 9 assists in last years finals? Stop it. There is no connection between high assists and not being able to win.  Sure it would be nice to see lebron in a movement system. But he has never had a coach to implement that or teammates who are good enough to play like that. Westbrook would still be a disaster if he played for the Warriors for example.
Bucks lost Jrue Holiday relatively early in the game no'?
Then Horst made a genius all in trade for Jrue Holiday and secured the extension for his superstar which is something Masai failed to do
Jrue Holiday trade? Giannis extension?
If you're the third best player on the team and you need a ton of shots to get into rhythm that's probably not a good sign. The best supporting stars are guys like Jrue Holiday or Pascal Siakam who make up for their lack of top-tier shot creation by doing all the little things and being able to finish plays well.
"Jrue Holiday:  2× NBA All-Defensive First Team (2018, 2021)  NBA All-Defensive Second Team (2019)"
*DDV &amp; Portis AND Jrue Holiday for over a half
Khris Middleton is a 2-time all star and Jrue Holiday is a first team all-defense player. Like yeah keep reinforcing my point
Before 2021 no one had any respect for kris Middleton or jrue holiday. Kd has the leading 3pt percentage shooter in joe and a fantastic blake griffin and a still great assist and floor general james harden. You can say anything you want but KD wasn't good enough
Jrue holiday played lol. But definitely a good win for the bucks
This is a post about Jrue Holiday not returning due to injury. You responded to a comment about the Bucks already missing some of their players due to injury. Nobody here is talking about Kyrie but you.
Jrue holiday isn’t choosing to sit out. Big difference
Hope nothing serious for Jrue Holiday 🙏
I will forever and always be a Jrue Holiday stan
Then and weirdly when Jrue holiday came out. I just love Jrue so much and I am so happy for him
Jrue Holiday is better than every other player that's been offered to the 76ers.
"I would absolutely correlate the Bucks ship to that. If not for Giannis ask/demand to get him some help, they probably don't give up the farm for Jrue Holiday, which along with other moves, ultimately proved to be a good move.  Same for the Clippers, the LA rivalry was non existent before Kawhi and George got there and helped bring in a bunch of pieces. The last two decades really just were LeBron's. I wouldn't say that's a ding still."
"Bucks biggest move is losing PJ Tucker because who will guard KD????? Bro we have a DPOY and Jrue Holiday on our team what kind of crack are you on? And Yes I know Historically Giannis hasn’t guarded the opponent’s best player, but that doesn’t mean he cant do it if he needs to."
"I mean, it's not on Russ. Kanter sets great screens. If you leave him on an island guarding a Dame PnR, he's going to get burned. Doesn't matter who it is.   Even Jrue holiday wouldn't be able to guard Dame if his big was a PnR liability."
"I don’t why I hate the Process so much. First, it short sells us Jrue Holiday. Next it takes Simmons over Ingram."
no bucks have to add in khris middleton and jrue holiday to get the goat tht. Alas sacrifices
"I agree with the 3rd option part I see him as a Jrue Holiday type of player we need a true superstar hopefully we land the 1 or 2 this upcoming draft. WCJ is really good try watching some Magic games this yr he was good with us, Okeke for a role player will be good too like Battier just plays the game the right way on both ends."
"Jrue “42% TS, playing elite defence on one-legged James Harden” Holiday sure carried that Nets series."
"So what defines a role player? Being a scorer? Draymond was crucial as a DPOY, game-breaking anchor. If Green is a role player, then Thompson is too, being an incredibly impactful facilitator and defensive superstar is not a ""role"". Jrue Holiday isn't a role player, neither is Draymond, not scoring well =/= being a role player..."
Ayo does that make jrue holiday Kuroko to Giannis’ kagami?
Jrue Holiday actually outplayed CP3. He was the X factor.
Forgot about Jrue Holiday. That guy fucked us up bad.
"Oh man, can you imagine a team having Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday, with Monty Williams as their head coach? Bare minimum that's a playoff team every year. I bet they wouldn't do anything stupid like trade for and sign Omer Asik to a massive contract."
"$228M for 5 years = ""I'm broke""   Now we know how [Jrue ""Big Money"" Holiday and Khris ""Khash Money"" Middleton](https://youtube.com/watch?v=78Xe5BlsEFk#t=3m14s) felt now."
"Teammates plural?  Our third best player is Patty Mills lol  Other title contenders' third best players are Jrue Holiday, Klay Thompson(when he comes back), and DeAndre Ayton  We have the much better #2 of course but thanks to Kyrie we pay a big price for that from #3 on down  If anything you seem to be obsessed with reiterating that the Nets are favorites just so you can clown us if we lose"
We need Harden to actually play like an MVP though  Right now he's playing around the same level as last season's version of Khris Middleton(much better playmaking but much worse defense) and given we don't have a Jrue Holiday that could be a big problem against a team like the Bucks  It says a lot that in the thread about who should be the other All NBA 1st team guard alongside Steph his name didn't get mentioned until like 4 or 5 names down the list
"Well his TS% isn't particularly good for a player in that role either.  We can quibble with which stat to cite, but none of them paint a good picture.  56.2% would be solid for a guy creating shots consistently, e.g. Jrue Holiday, but it's pretty bad for a guy who only spots up off the league MVP.  He's in PJ tucker territory with that volume/efficiency"

"I don't know if this is what you're looking for and he's not an all time great but Jrue Holiday. Last year after game 5 of the ECF series against the Hawks, Charles Barkley was saying how Jrue could've been the next Gary Payton if he had a more aggressive personality."
"The Pelicans do not have a shooting coach. Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Jrue Holiday, and Jonas Valunciunas all had their shot naturally improve as a result of the humid weather and spicy food here in New Orleans. Please stop referring to and inquiring about some guy named Fred (who I can assure you I've never heard of)"
yea i think we understand but when pace is used it tells you a lot more (like per 100 possessions).  For example the Jrue Holiday Sixers were almost definitely not a worse offense than the 2013 process sixers with MCW even though they scored less.
"Yeah there was some report before the beginning of last offseason where it was reported that we were interested in Jrue (using Kemba + picks), and that was also during the time of Hayward's FA, where it looked like we could've turned Hayward into Turner + Aaron Holiday in a S&amp;T with Indiana where Hayward wanted to go and the Pacers were ok with that swap.   It's fascinating to think of what that potential team could've looked like, Jrue/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Turner is like, the best defensive 5 in the NBA by such a wide margin it's ridiculous, however the offense would be very challenging, that Jrue/Smart backcourt is great on defense, but there's also a lot of bricks on offense."
"The only season he's shot above 33% from three was last year, in a generally inflated shooting environment (see: Julius randle, jrue holiday, et al). I need to see more consistency from him before I buy that development"
I was also thinking Jrue Holiday. His defense is beast and he is a particularly underrated scorer.
I remember watching a video on Avery Bradley guarding Steph curry and he explains that you throw all the fundamentals you’re taught out the window. Example being when your off ball on defense you’re supposed to be in between your man in the basket but Bradley explained he’d stay behind curry(or on his right hip/shoulder) to get over the screens quicker. Jrue Holiday also said something similar about have to guard him so differently.
"Jrue Holiday, so underrated, i assure you so underrated, most underrated player  Before that Mike Conley for sure, underrated"
"Only argument I can make is Giannis. He’s now doing things he was doing in his MVP season after a rough start for an injury plagued team. Now he’s barely playing any minutes and still blowing teams out. In a playoff series, Jrue holiday and good team defense is an answer for Steph. Draymond is not an answer for Giannis."

Have the Nuggets ever really had that elite perimeter defender to guard these guys? I’m sure if they had a guy like Jrue Holiday or even Ben Simmons they’d be fine.
"He has the better record and team, but Durant is still better. Steph couldn’t get past the Lakers and MEMP, Durant took on Jrue Holiday, Middleton, Giannis, PJ, Lopez as the sole star and nearly won"
He's gone from below average to above average but this sub would make you think he went from above average to Jrue Holiday
"Everybody who dosent watch the games and only sticks to narratives always clowns me when I say Curry has become a legit good almost great defender. He is always playing with high effort and IQ, he has active hands, quick feet and he has gotten so much stronger in recent years it’s harder to just play bully ball with him    There have also been a few possessions this year from Curry where he straight clamped guys up like he was Jrue Holiday. Currys defensive improvement the last few years has been nothing short of insane especially considering he has played his best defense star 30 years old"
Not even close. I’m saying Davion Mitchell isn’t on the same tier as Jrue Holiday or Ben Simmons. My comment wasn’t referring to Steph at all.
In Kobes era guards like T Mac and Marbury dribbled the air out of the ball for 20 seconds before 3 pump fakes and taking a fade away. In which on ball defense was way more important for all players really.   I'm not sure how you think off ball defense for guards is more valuable than on ball. Even for the best guards today. What type of sets or plays are happening where you think a player is making great off ball defense on the perimeter? It's just straight up not as important for guards as it is for forwards and centers. Who need to rotate to close off the paint and prevent layups.  Only example that comes to mind is Kyle Lowry taking charges in the paint. But it's not like Steph or any other guard is really elite at that. Maybe Manu as well.  But Kobes defense was outstanding. If anything it's underrated by the 14 year olds on here who were still in diapers when he was 1st team all D.   Prime Kobe was as good as Jrue Holiday or any of the top guard defenders today.
Have you met Zion? Is he really that big? What’s jrue holiday like? He seems chill af.
I don’t know why I can’t imagine jaygup being good unless he becomes Jrue Holiday. I feel like Garuba can definitely have a Ibaka like career though
Middleton was an all star snub and Jrue Holiday is a smidge below an all star in ability.  Wildly different to this Mavs team or 2011 Mavs team.
"If were being honest, that steal by jrue holiday on booker at the end of game 5 i believe was clearly a foul. Suns would have been up 3-2"
I think Curry’s has implied Jrue Holiday is the best at guarding him
"Personally I think it’s pretty clear when you factor in defense. He does things on that end the other two can’t come close to, especially Curry. Of course he can’t shoot, but he’s so unstoppable at the rim he’s putting up similar scoring numbers to the other two.   The Bucks record is the main thing throwing people off, but we started off the most injured team in the league this year. Now that Khris and Jrue are back we’re going on a nice little run now— Giannis/Khris/Jrue are 8-0 when playing together so far.   I will say I understand that the Warriors record is hard to ignore, so it makes sense why a lot of people are rating Curry so highly this season. My mind is personally made up however— even if Steph became Holiday-esque on defense Giannis would still arguably be more valuable because of his size   Edit: This isn’t to attack Steph fans or anything, I just think there’s a clear top 3 right now and the better player is a decision of minuscule margins."
considering the extent of his injury the contributions he actually made while being guarded by jrue holiday were more then enough. Stupid take.
"&gt;Tim Duncan played with multiple hall of fame players in the most egalitarian offense of the era.  Uhhh...the Spurs of the early 2000's were not the most egalitarian offense of the era. In Tim's best scoring season (2001-02) he was playing with 19 year old Tony Parker and 36 year old David Robinson. He scored more than double the next closest player. He's frequently praised for carrying those squads for a reason. Per possession, it would have ranked as AD's 7th best scoring season.  &gt;I'm sure this AD numbers are from his pelicans days where his best offensive team mate was..... Ryan Anderson? Jrue Holiday?  That makes it even more impressive to me that AD scored better than Duncan given how often people say he can't create his own offense.  &gt;Also, show me the playoff numbers. When Duncan needed to put up 40… he'd do it.  Duncan was excellent in the playoffs...where he still scored at lower volume on lower relative efficiency than AD.  Duncan's best statistical 4 year playoff run (04-07): 33.6 pts/100poss,  +3 rts%.   AD's: 36.3 pts/100poss, +7 rts%.   Duncan's clearly the better player, but it's because of his consistency and defense, not his offensive production."
"Tim Duncan played with multiple hall of fame players in the most egalitarian offense of the era.  I'm sure this AD numbers are from his pelicans days where his best offensive team mate was..... Ryan Anderson? Jrue Holiday?  Also, show me the playoff numbers. When Duncan needed to put up 40… he'd do it."
"It doesn’t really matter, they’re both PGs and both bad. Guard defence matters even if it’s not as much as bigs but we’re not talking about the difference between Jrue Holiday and Isaiah Thomas here. Swapping out one for the other will have pretty close to zero impact on your chances of winning."
Jrue or Holiday?
"He is very, very good. Like a young Jrue Holiday"
What's going to be their Jrue Holiday trade?
Dort turning into Jrue Holiday has been a nice addition for us.
"Personally I'm seeing your take everywhere on this sub recently and am starting to think on ball defense is becoming far too underrated. The most important factor imo in a successful offense is getting past the first defender to force the defensive team to make rotations, whether that comes from breaking down your man 1 on 1, passing to a cutter or a pick and roll. Therefore reliably keeping your man in front of you removes one of these points of attack and is very valuable to team defense. When you look at the Jazz, who have the best off ball defender in the league in Gobert, widely known as the most impactful defender in the league. You see that in the playoffs fans mistake his defense for being worse or overrated, yet the reason is his guards/wings are getting burned on the perimeter all day long and he cant guard everyone. No matter how good you are at off ball defense/rotations, being forced to rotate will always end up in open looks at some point.  The step further to this is what guys like Dort, Jrue, Dejounte do which is not just keep them in front but actively pressure and disrupt the offensive player. This makes it harder for them pass and in the case of lead guards, orchestrate offense, which limits even more options (see Holiday on Paul in the finals). This type of defense I think is incredibly valuable and as I said appears to be underrated now in favour of off ball defense. Which is strange to me because people often call it team defense, which it is, but team defense is so heavily affected by coaching that I think it's hard to always give an individual player credit for it.  P.S. My comment isn't really directed at you, I just wanted to get my thoughts written out once your comment got me thinking about it lol"
He turned into Jrue Holiday so I love him
"if you think Jrue Holiday is the best wing defender in the league.. man.  He's a phenomenal guard defender but you'd rather Jrue on LeBron and KD, than Bam? Your comments make a lot more sense now."
"I promise you Bam Adebayo is not the best wing defender in the league, that would be Jrue Holiday, or Ben Simmons. Hes your boy though, so I get it but lets not take it too far"
"Pg: jrue holiday  Sg: Dort  Sf: kawhi  Pf: giannis  C: AD   The Dort disrespect is incredible. People forget he locked down harden in the bubble. Also, kawhi &gt; bam for so so so many reasons."
"Hes “on track” but that’s assuming everything falls into place for the rest of his career, which is unlikely. He’s got 7-8 more years of his prime left to win some more rings, but a Khris Middleton ACL tear, Jrue Holiday decline, or a lack of development from anyone else can rule him out from winning a title for the next few years. Ontop of that, we saw what happened with the Warriors, and any dynasty team can emerge out of nowhere. The league changes fast and it’s naive to guarantee the Bucks winning a couple more titles.   He needs more MVP’s, and it’s really easy for that to not happen. If Lebron doesn’t win MVP this year, he’s gone 9 seasons without winning one. It’s easy to argue he was so dominant in that 9 year stretch that he should’ve won at least 2 MVP awards, but looking year by year, that argument becomes near impossible.   Basically, he has one of the best resumes at 26 that we’ve ever seen, but that’s far from being on track for GOAT, so many things can happen, and so many things need to fall into place."
"Spurs with DeRozan  Raptors with Lowry  Jrue Holiday and Pelicans  Marc Gasol and the Grizzles  Chris Paul on the Thunder  There’s definitely a few, most of these all parties, player, organisation and fans all wished the best and thanked eachother…"
Nobody on the T Wolves was as good as Jrue Holiday.  Jrue Holiday is a top 30 player in the league right now and he was better on the Pelicans than he was now.  KGs best teammate was mid 30s Sam Cassell.  Quit the cap and do some fucking research.
True but IMO those are the least important qualities for guards  And like you said Luka being a better defender is more a case of him being less bad than of him being Jrue Holiday or someone on that end
"&gt;For example, would you rather have a 25ppg player who is only healthy for 40 games (1000 total points) or a 22ppg player who plays every game of the season (1804)?  that's not as clear cut as you think as even if you hold all else equal statistically if they're both healthy for the playoffs and I have a solid team around them I may take the 25.   Using totals tells us a cross between durability and skill, but durability is pretty perfectly measured in simple games played. Using totals to make points leads to foolish stats like this [https://twitter.com/djvhagg/status/1462071839988011022?s=21](https://twitter.com/djvhagg/status/1462071839988011022?s=21)  We also have to consider how early it is in the season. Totals may hold slightly more weight when you look back towards the end of the year, but this early if Jrue Holiday played even one more game there's a solid chance he'd be tied with or past Giannis. A stat that could completely fall apart by not even next week isn't so great.   To me what's more impressive is how 4/5 of these hold up into per-game"
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. DeMar DeRozan 4. Blake Griffin 5. Jrue Holiday 6. Danny Green 7. Jeff Teague 8. Ricky Rubio 9. Patty mills

"Casual take, injuries ruined last year otherwise it’s a different season, and when he was in the championship situation (aka the finals) he did his part and helped win. What’s he supposed to do win every game by himself with Lebron out? (hard for any team to win without its best player, let alone Lebron) It almost seems like playing with better players leads to better results? What’s he supposed to do? Go beat the warriors with Jrue holiday? lol"
Mark Jackson doesn’t get enough credit for the Warriors defense.   You are underrating or under appreciating Jrue Holiday my friend. He deserves that contract.
"Remember when the Pelicans had both Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday and the number 1 pick in the Zion draft? Oh how bright the future seemed…"
"Yeah if Smart could be a slightly better scorer, he's not far off from being in that Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry tier of point guard. I like that he's focusing more on 2-point scoring, I like his mid-range game in the post and he's a good decision maker if he draws 2."
"The biggest issue is they don't have a PG that can run an offense. Neither Jayson or Jaylen is great at passing and Smart is pretty mediocre as well. JB snd JT barely average 5 assists combined. They need a player who can get the rest team shots as well. They both make Kobe look like Chris Paul. Not saying you trade either, but they need someone. Lonzo or Rubio would have been a great pickup, but in truth they need a Jrue Holiday or CP type to pair with those two to truly contend."
That sounds like a (offensive) jrue holiday special lmao.  :( at least this season
LOL give me james harden &amp; jrue holiday/middleton over whatever the hell we put out there last year. U think KD and Giannis gona do shit with a compazzo/rivers backcourt? nah
"A lot of people will say that he is what he can defend, position wise. Offensively, forget about positions nowadays. But who can he defend?  He'll get bodied like hell from guards like Lowry or Jrue Holiday. And forget about him spending time down low.  I could see him as a floater playing help d, defending the rim as a helper. But 1v1 will be rough until he put on weight"
joe harris isnt the first player to underperform. you cant rely  on star players either. jrue holiday had a terrible series against us and so did klay thompson many times for the warriors. curry choked in 2016 and so did klay. lebron in 2011. westbrook over his entire career. people have bad series.
"Yea but during a 5ish year stretch they drafted Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Dario Saric, Zhaire Smith, and Nerlens Noel all in the first round. Of those picks only Embiid has worked out for them.   At the start of the process they traded away Jrue Holiday who is a 15-20 ppg perennial DPOY candidate now. He’s no Embiid but the process is ultimately a failure, as they are looking to ship out Simmons and build up a new team. Ironically Maxey looks like a future all-star and they got him with the 21st pick.   Yes I’m being petty but I’ve relished in their failed drafting and I think that Hinkie is overrated and actually got out at the perfect time. I’m a big fan of Embiids game though and hope he wins a ring at some point (with them or somewhere else). I hope OKC follows a similar path."
"I don't get what you're refuting here. They played with those guards. They still carried and led the team. Guards are ball-dominant by nature. Every team needs a guard to bring the ball up and pass the ball and facilitate the offense. I listed examples of players who were not ball dominant but still carried their teams.  In fact the fact that there are other ball dominant guards on those teams who might be all star caliber players but STILL weren't the team leaders or offensive team leaders is the very essence of my rebuttal.  Maybe I'm not conveying this properly, and maybe it's my poor semantics. My point is this:  - Karl Malone played next to John Stockton. Karl Malone ""led the team"". He won the MVPs, not John Stockton.  - Giannis played next to Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, whatever. He won the MVPs and FMVPs, not Jrue or Khris. He ""led the team"".  - Shaq played next to Kobe, one of the most ball-dominant guards of all time (albeit in in the triangle). Shaq won the FMVPs, not Kobe. Shaq ""led the team"".  - KD played with Russell Westbrook, another ball-dominant guard. KD led the team.  The excuse that AD isn't in a position to ""lead a team"" solely due to his role in the offense in that he doesn't bring the ball up the court, handle the ball, playmake for others, is bullshit. Because of those examples.  You said here ""Luka, Trae Young, Dame"" are in the position to do so, and so they unfairly get more credit. This makes no sense. Because of those examples. AD should be good enough and has played alongside enough talent to be able to lead a team and carry a team to playoff contention."

lol you think if you replaed Jrue holiday with CP3 the bucks still dont win?  Winning a championship is more than one person
I feel the same way about the 2018-19 Bucks.   They were a decent team but they didn't really get serious until the Drew Bledsoe / Jrue Holiday swap.

"&gt; Yes, because Curry can't guard star player one on one.   I agree that Curry can't guard star players 1 on 1, but my point is that no one else can as well. Obviously, there are exceptions like Jrue Holiday, but even Jrue has Giannis / AD (in the past) ready to rotate.    &gt;That is why GSW made their name on defense by switcing, to cover for Curry lack on 1 on 1 defense.   Every team in the league switches. If you don't switch, you're most likely giving up a wide-open 3 or a free drive to the basket."
I also think /Giannis/Bam/Butler/Gobert/Jrue Holiday/PG13 are all extremely close to Draymond green defensively. Draymond is great but he isn’t worlds above any of the guys I listed above and it’s not even close

"Yes they played with ball dominant guards. But they were able to take over or lead teams regardless. Point and fact is, any of those players can lead a team, create for themselves without the need of some great ball-dominant guard. Establish position at the elbows inward, and get the ball over to them. Did they play with great guards? Sure. Makes sense to complement. Did they need them to “lead a team”? Nah. Put another way: could any of those “great guards” that they played with be described as the players leading the team? Nope. It’s the players I’ve listed.  Put another way, pair Jrue Holiday, Rondo, etc (your examples), with any of those players and they’re contenders.  Regarding your other point: why does position matter? Thank you for the other examples, which would ADD to the argument, not detract from it. However, I didn’t list those players because their roles in offenses have indeed been to create for themselves and for their teammates. They would fit into the example you’ve described — doing something purely by virtue of the position they play in the offense.  Additional examples listing off the top of my head: Giannis for many years. Karl Malone. Charles Barkley. D Rob.  The counter examples happen to be bigs, but point is plenty of players out there don’t need to be bringing the ball up, distributing and facilitating, and being primary ball handler — and they’ve certainly led their teams to great success."
"Penny hardaway, Kobe, Wade,TP, Manu, Clyde drexler, Kenny Smith, Sam Cassell, Marbury, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Westbrook, Curry, Kyrie, Harden. Those are some of the ball dominant guards those players you listed played with.   AD has played with Jrue Holiday, Rondo past his prime, Jimmer Fredette, Austin Rivers, Tim Frazier, Quinn Cook, Eric Gordon before he left the Pelicans. You also just compared him to the greatest centers of all time, so that's a pretty high bar. Also putting KD in that list pretty much destroys your entire argument, might as well throw in Kwahi, Bron and TMac if you're just throwing in wings as well."
"Not sure how Jrue Holiday fits into the equation, but ok."
Pat bev Draymond Jrue holiday
"Don't know about best, but I'd throw in a nomination for Jrue Holiday (if he doesn't win any more rings that would get him in.)  If he was on a big team for the prime of his career instead of in ~~witness protection~~ New Orleans, he'd probably have a bunch of All-Defense selections and at least a handful more All Star appearances, which combined with the ring could have been enough.  Instead, he has almost no accolades, beyond having so many opposing players saying he's the hardest defender they faced."
"Deandre Ayton was the third option on a Finals team. Jrue Holiday was, too. Wiggins isn't better than either player."
Jrue's last year in Philly vs current Maxey:  |Player|Season|MP|FG%|3P%|2P%|FT%|TS%|REB|AST|STL|TOV|PTS| |:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Jrue Holiday|2012-13|37.5|.431|.368|.446|.752|.496|4.2|8.0|1.6|3.7|17.7| |Tyrese Maxey|2021-22|35.6|.524|.421|.557|.868|.613|3.7|4.6|0.8|1.2|18.4|  Uhm...
"Yes it is. You guys got a good one. His confidence and intangibles are astounding for a 19 y/o rookie, and he seems even much better than Green so far.  If you guys just planning to keep on losing, Silas gotta play him more. Hoping that your teenagers like Garuba and Christopher would be included in the rotation also because those two are your franchise' future foundation. Garuba is too good to be benched with that Draymond Green-like defensive potential, just needs to improve the offense. And Jaygup seems good also and has a chance to become a productive two-way player a la Jrue Holiday  Trade CWood in the deadline (preferrably a team who needs a big like Charlotte), move KPJ in sixth-man role, tank for Banchero, and hire a development coach (sort of Kenny Atkinson)"
"Dort's supremely physically talented. He's a solid 225 pounds, and he has freakish lateral quickness and recovery that rivals even Jrue Holiday. Outside of Holiday and Smart, there aren't really many other guards with that combination of bulk, athleticism, defensive instincts, and recovery ability.  He's a very athletic guy, who is strong as shit and can effortlessly get up off the floor too.   As a rookie in the playoffs, he was regularly checking Harden 1 vs 1, and he had many stops on him. The fact that he already has those kinds of instincts, foot speed, and the defensive IQ to guard players like Harden in his first year, shows how extremely talented he is as a player."
"Damn, those are Jrue Holiday numbers"
"...Jrue Holiday is a superstar, he's just underrated by fans. I'd much rather pay Holiday the max than some others who deserve it.   Playing two way ball very well or being head and shoulders above everyone at one way is what superstars do. Jrue is in the first camp."
I think Dorts absolute ceiling (and probably like 5% likelihood) is like Jrue Holiday. Which don’t get me wrong is incredible but not quite superstar level.
"Because we overpaid both of them. Jrue isn't a player that's worth 40m/year especially when he'll be 35 in his last season and has a player option and all money guaranteed. Khris didn't deserve a max when he got it. Not even Bucks fans wanted us to give him the max, but since WE CAN'T SIGN FAs, it was either him or nobody. The FO knows that too and gave him a max.  Well if it's like that, again, why has no small market signed a big FA ever? Other than LeBron who decided to go back home. Look at the big markets / nicer cities in the league and the FAs they have been able to sign. Now look at the smaller markets. How can you not see the difference between signing PG, Kawhi, LeBron, KD, AD, Kyrie without giving up anything, and giving 160m to Jrue Holiday, for whom we gave up Bledsoe, Hill, 2 1st round picks and 2 FRP swaps."
If my goal is to win a playoff series I’m easily taking Jrue Holiday over Lamelo Ball    I like Lamelo more long term but as of now I think Trae still clearly had the edge
Jrue holiday ???
"At the very least, all-nba defensive team.   He deserved it last year too, but since he wasn’t a starter, he wasn’t part of the conversation.   He’s proven himself to be in the same level level defensively as guys like Thybull, Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday."
"Giannis out his own mouth said he doesn’t make friends with the rivals in the league so what are you talking about? Harden came to the Nets because of KD, who came cause of Kyrie who grew up a nets fan which he admitted. You acting like superstars keep coming to that trash ass franchise LMAOOOO. Your also strapped on what you can do cause of this little thing called market cap and the Jrue holiday trade. Btw the book has been debunked several times over for a lot of what it said according to the nets fans all over social media.   You whining like a bitch cause a poverty franchise finally got lucky after pulling themselves out of a dumpster fire that was the billy king trade? Bottom of the east, can’t even tank. No love in your own city, free agents didn’t come to you out together a decent team? I much rather you talk about the lakers than complain about the fucking Nets  like come on it’s the **FUCKING NETS**"
Jrue Holiday
Why does it have to be an issue? Sometimes you make the wrong decision even if it made sense in your mind. We act like even great GMs never fuck up rofl. And maybe they’ll turn it around. People were also moaning about jrue Holiday all fucking season and playoffs last year.
"Thought the Bucks gave up wayy too much for Jrue Holiday, they gave up a lot but it has clearly paid off"
"Compre them to UCLA guards tho. I’d take UCLA over Kentucky.   Westbrook, Lavine, jrue, Aaron holiday, lonzo, norm powell, Ariza, etc."
"I'm a nets fan since Jason kidd, Kenyon Martin, and Richard Jefferson. Why would I be bitter, I'm not playing and losing the same way you aren't playing and winning lol. But you can carry Currys one ring ahead of kd. Tough road. Played the pelicans without jrue holiday, jazz without connelly, and cavs without love and kyrie. Curry really showed those back up pgs who is boss"
"Hell even Trae was snubbed of one. I would say Jrue Holiday could be an optimistic peak for him. Then again I think it’s very realistic that he and Cole Anthony wind up being very similar in terms of skill level, which sorta makes his drafting a bit of a disappointment for a pick so high in a stacked draft. We won’t really be able to accurately say for a few years though."
"Not really. Steph actually has a better motor on D than all of the guys I mentioned even before this year. Good at playing passing lanes. All small PGs not named Jrue Holiday, Pat Bev get picked on a lot on switches due to size. The PG position by nature is the weakest position defensively."
"Curry is not a top 4 guard defender in the league and even he knows it. The fact that people in this thread are taking this seriously is embarrassing.  He'd have to beat 6 of Jrue Holiday, Butler, CP3, Vanvleet, Thybulle, Bridges, Dort, Jaylen Brown, Caruso. Would be a joke if he makes all-defense, but voters love him so who knows."
"2020 - Maxey, Joe, Reed  2021 - Springer, Petrusev, Bassey  I'm hoping Springer develops into a Jrue Holiday."
Yeah I don’t think Suggs is a bust or anything. I liked Orlando’s draft. I was just personally not super high on Suggs as like a top 5 pick and thought he should go mid-lottery. He’s shown flashes and he’ll probably slowly develop. Optimistically he could be a Jrue Holiday type guard in his prime. What’s funny is I don’t know what Orlando will do if they have to chose between him and Cole Anthony who’s playing really well and looks like he has real potential too.
"Jrue Holiday had 41 to sweep you guys out of the playoffs. Career highs being regular season only makes no sense, you scored 41 in an NBA game, that should be your career high, regular season or playoffs."
"That seems like a crazy good defensive lineup.   Jrue Holiday, top-tier guard defender  Donte DiVincenzo, apparently a decent perimeter defender  Kris Middleton, great wing defender  Giannis Antetokounmpo, reigning DPOY  Brook Lopez, elite paint protector  How does anyone ever score on them? Hopefully I'll see tonight, lol."
By that logic AD owns dame because he's 8-1 against him in the playoffs and Jrue Holiday does too because he's 4-0
I still won’t forget when r/nba said it would be mutually beneficial if the Nets swap Kyrie for Jrue Holiday lol

"Nah, We looking for something on the level of that Jrue Holiday package or else I’d rather keep Vooch"
Yea remind me the last time Jrue Holiday has done anything in the playoffs. Harden nearly beat the Kd-Warriors in a 7 game series with the Rockets.
counterpoint: I would not.   Downgrading from James Harden to Jrue Holiday for a median level starting C who plays a replaceable as hell role is not good
"No Jrue Holiday will win you playoff games, James Harden will win you championships."
Kyrie irving for jrue holiday who says no
Welcome to the Pelicans’ fanbase. We run on logic. That’s why Jrue Holiday is more loved than Anthony Davis.
The Bucks got Jrue Holiday for 3 picks+ 2 swaps and some decent filler. We've got worse filler but we can offer salary relief and as many as 4 picks+3 swaps and 2nd round picks.
"Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Lu Dort, Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons"
"Don’t be surprised, this sub thinks Jrue Holiday for Kyrie is a mutually beneficial trade."
"They're like a Jrue Holiday and a better coach away from being able to bust anyone's ass on any given night. Idk if it's a championship team, but they just need a veteran, a defensive identity and some direction on offense."
"100%. I remember thinking it would have taken like 5 years of team revenue for harden after the holiday trade. The bucks panicked and its apparent now. People talk shit on ainge for not pulling the trigger but this is a crazy league and you never know when an ""untouchable"" star will become available and you don't want to have used up everything you've got for a guy like holiday. I love jrue btw and its not his fault that they gave up a kings ransom for him"
"I don't think holiday is the issue. Hes an all star caliber player, but I think that the bucks could have used the assets they traded for jrue to acquire someone who would fit their team better or someone that is just a flat out better player. The package they parted with wasn't that far off from what the nets sent for harden. Harden and giannis would be absolutely perfect together"
I think the way he gets to the restricted area to make the shot is a big part of the equation. Like Jrue Holiday and Eric Bledsoe are not typically breaking ankles on the way to the rim like Kyrie is.
"This is a classic example of trying to play basketball on a stat sheet. Kyrie’s ability to finish at the rim is unparalleled. If you’re telling me you genuinely think that Jrue Holiday or Eric Bledsoe are better finishers than Kyrie Irving, then I know you haven’t watched any 3 of those players for more than 5 minutes, total."
"One Iverson made enemies in every front office outside of Denver and that's questionable if he didn't in Denver. Two Westbrook hasn't shown an unwillingness to go to the bench as was what many thought of him when he was drafted. Three he's a three star recruit that lucked out because circumstances got him in good positions. He wasn't going to be in UCLA until Farmar left, 2 Kevin Love came to the Bruins his sophomore year, 3 he could've stayed but that would be detrimental to his draft stock since Jrue Holiday was coming and UCLA may not have given him the minutes or attention, and lastly Sam Presti wanted him more than what scouts thought. They had Brook Lopez over Westbrook in many mock drafts. So in many respects he's overachieved his entire career now comes can he adapt once his max contract is up."
Those same days where he left because Jrue Holiday was on his way
"-The Bucks defensive scheme is what makes then defend the 3 poorly  -Giannis' inability to shoot a midrange or free throws wouldn't be as bad of a problem if they ran an offense that didn't require him to carry the ball, Jrue Holiday is an top tier playmaker and Giannis could be one of the best PnR partners in the league. Do something about it   -Bad depth is whatever I guess, most of the Bucks' ""depth"" were not good in the playoffs anyways."
"Well for starters our defensive scheme regularly gives up 20+ threes a game. It’s not an anomaly at this point we leave everyone open. It would be a great scheme 20 years ago when no one shot 3s but it’s not feasible anymore.       Secondly we have a good offense that stagnates in the clutch for several reasons. One issue is we traded a huge package for Jrue holiday, who has been great, yet he has the second lowest usage rate of his career (behind his rookie year) and even crazier Bledsoe had a higher usage rate last year. Another blaring issue is Giannis just isn’t a good FT shooter at all so it can just be hack-a-Giannis when he beats his man.       Finally we have very little depth. Portis is pretty much our only good bench option while guys like Forbes and DJ Augustin have played poorly.      Idk there’s not too much to inspire hope in this team rn that we’re legitimate contenders but the good news is we know as well as anyone that the regular season is more or less meaningless so hopefully we’re just experimenting with lineups or something."
-28 for the 8 minutes Jrue Holiday was not playing.
Jrue Holiday is shooting like he plays for the Charlotte Hornets
Nets should trade Kyrie for All-World Jrue Holiday.
"I do it every day from multiple computers and Twitter and I always go Beal, Jaylen, Tatum, Bam and Holiday. I am a Celtics fan, but would kill to have Beal, Bam or Jrue—I love them all. I know it’s not realistic but maybe one of the three will get a reserve spot  West I never vote for Luka, or AD just to change it up. Dame and Donovan, Jokic, Williamson and Lebron."
"Yeah you know maybe he wasn't talking about rudy, but he did say DPOY...rudy was just who everyone was saying he was talking about. And the major point of discussion was jrue holiday not making all nba defense.  https://youtu.be/BUAsPUbbc20"
Kung Fu Jrue Holiday
Check my post history for r/NBA users saying they feel “kinship” with white people in the thread about Jrue Holiday donating to Black businesses
Maybe Jrue Holiday wasn't worth all the draft picks
  Is KP appreciably worse than Jrue Holiday? Or CJ McCollum? Or Clint Capela?   When AD missed the playoffs in NOLA you guys put it all on him. You would do the same if Lillard or Trae misses this year. Why is it different with Luka?
Eric Bledsoe &gt; Jrue Holiday apparently
"If the Bucks lose early in the playoffs, it will 100% be Giannis's fault. We have seen Jrue Holiday perform in the playoffs and last year Middleton and Lopez balled out. Giannis since becoming an MVP has wilted under the pressure of the best team's playoff defense, against Toronto and Miami.   With no Bledsoe to fuck up shit even further and having 2 all star caliber players aside him and a DPOY caliber center who can space the floor....there is no excuse left. Giannis performs like his regular season self, Bucks might 4-1 every team in their path. Otherwise, they will go home early due to Giannis's lack of half court offense."
"Agree, Jrue Holiday is not gonna bring you to the finals."
"Honestly, the addition of Jrue Holiday *and* the subtraction of Eric Bledsoe can go a long way."
Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley for co-MUPs of the year

"This was always very telling about his floor raising ability:   2015-19: Anthony Davis with no Jrue Holiday: 4180 min  -3.12 net rating 107.02 offensive rating.   Jrue Holiday no Anthony Davis 2929 min: -2.41 net rating 109.38 offensive rating   I know he did a good job in the playoffs at this when he was hitting way above his career norms on jumpers but [by and large the story with him in the minutes without LeBron have been largely much of the same](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&amp;Season=2020-21,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=2544,203076).   AD is a great player but any situation where he is cast as having no 1 offensive burden type responsibility likely isnt conducive to him being a serious MVP candidate."

"Kevin Love, John Wall, Dreymond Green, Jrue Holiday, and Nassir Little."
Jrue (and his brothers) holiday
"So then you mean that in the offseason he can force off lopez, and then call up Jokic and say ""sorry buckaroo, you're coming here no matter what you say"" Also, have you ever heard of a man a Mr. Jrue Holiday?"
"Injury also played a factor. He was carrying in a lot of those years so that took a toll on his body. Heck even Jrue Holiday barely completed any season with New Orleans. They were successful when both were healthy. That organization just sucks in terms of health. Probably the water, food, or whatever since up to now they’re like that in terms of injuries."
Heat but it will be closer with Jrue ‘not quite as good as Malcom Brogdon’ Holiday this year
"Bucks, because if Jrue Holiday replacing Bledsoe is not enough, then what the hell more do they need?"
"He was never snubbed... here are all the diff PGs in the NBA that made a All Star game during Conley career (2007 - present) whom were BETTER than Conley when they made the All Star team or where playing equally as well, but played in the East...  West - Nash, Tony Parker, CP3, Steph, Westbrook, Dame, Kidd, Deron Williams, Iverson  East - Kyrie, Rose, Rondo, Deron Williams, Arenas, Billups, Kidd, Joe Johnson, Iverson, Wall, Teague, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba, Dragic, Trae Young  Only these 4 guys can you even argue that MAYBE Conley was more deserving than, but again all these dudes played in the East...  Devin Harris, Mo Williams, Joe Johnson, Jrue Holiday  Sooooo, yea.. never snubbed... never really deserved it. All Star is best of the best... not best solid consistent players"
The Jrue holiday trade completely screwed with people's ideas of a fair trade. Jrue was a desperation trade to get Giannis to stay. Lakers aren't desperate for Beal or LaVine
"&gt;there was no overcorrection to call him underrated even when he wasn't anymore  i'm talking about being the mislabeling of him when it no longer applies  there's nothing to argue here, just read what i said about overcorrection and drill it into your head  jrue holiday got called underrated so often that *everyone* calling him that, the label became meaningless  dame was underrated because he didn't get his recognition, he's not continuously called that because he's recognized as a top 10 player by most now  again, there was no OVERCORRECTION"
Jrue Holiday is so cold
"Jrue Holiday, Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday and Public Holiday"
Not too much but jrue holiday a bit when people say he and smart are by far the best guard defenders in the league(smart is clearly better imo).  I saw someone in preseason say mills defense would get worse partially due to going from Bledsoe to holiday and they look right so far.   ik mil is trying some things on defense instead of just dropping every pnr but still think too many assumed holiday would be an upgrade defensively too.
"Jokic, he's by far the best player according to impact metrics which are designed to tell you which player helps the team win the most. Now with MPJ back Jokic's play will translate to a bunch of Ws again. Joker's putting up massive numbers but they also are as valuable as they look.  Historically guys like Andre Kirilenko and Iggy fit the bill. Iguodala rarely had standout boxscore seasons but impacted the game like an All-Star for many years. Jimmy Butler comes to mind if we look at the past 2-3 years. Draymond is another good example. Chauncey Billups is another one. Jason Kidd put up unspectacular numbers but was a high impact player. Lowry is another great example as you mentioned. Honestly any Top10 player fits the bill as well, strictly speaking. Harden Bron AD Giannis Kawhi KD have the highest impact in the league and so their impressive boxscores are also the opposite of empty stats. Jrue Holiday is another guy that has more impact than his statlines suggest. Generally great wing defenders fit in that department since their value is hard to capture through traditional means."
The Jrue holiday trade was a punt on this season - they’re worse than expected but we’re never slated to be a top 6 team in the west maybe
"David Griffin constructed a poor team around Zion. Lonzo's been in the league for 3 seasons now. If you were expecting him to save you from the 3 pt line, that's your fault because there's nothing about watching him that makes you think he's ""suddenly start missing threes.""  Griffin could've gotten better shooters in the offseason but didn't. The only reason Steven Adams is a positive for your roster is because you literally don't have any other centers. You guys have no worthy bigs besides him. And then he picked Bledsoe over George Hill, again which could've helped your shooting. He didn't get shooters for Jrue Holiday. This is not a well-made team for Zion."
"It really is insane how much this sub overrates him. I love a good role player (was one of the few defending guys like kcp on the lakers sub the last couple years) but the love for Rubio truly puzzles me. The dude is a decent passer and defender but other than that he brings nothing to the floor especially in the playoffs.   There’s a couple players this sub vastly overrated. Mike Conley, jrue holiday, Rubio, and Jeremy Lin were all treated as some sort of secret super stars being held back by their teams. Make no mistake Mike Conley and holiday are great players, and Lin/Rubio were good role players but they weren’t some sort of mistreated super stars"
"But the Nets should trade Kyrie straightup for Jrue Holiday, right r/nba?"
Very Jrue Holiday-esque in that respect. Jrue is very slow but walks in and uses his body to make space and get shots.
The dumbest part is I saw AD hugging Jrue holiday last game
"It’s very funny to me how before this season people were like - ""Bucks have Jrue now. They got that missing piece.""   And now narration is - ""Middleton and Holiday ain’t good enough to be sidekicks on a contender. Imagine if Giannis played with Kobe!""  I’m glad that finally people start to realize how biased this sub is about Giannis."
"I’ll double-down on my point.  He’s 28 and having a really really bad year and worse thing is he’s getting paid 24m.  He’s too old to be rebuilding with a young core to meet their timely e and contenders can’t afford 24m for his limited skill set.  Sure he can help teams within 8-12 seed like the Knicks or Magic, but why would they give up young core or future 1st round picks, how does it help their future to win the championship?  Buddy might be an elite shooter but lacks consistency in finishing at the rim 43% last year and 37% this year He also lacks ability to get to the line averaging &lt;2 FTA per game, this shows in his true shooting % which is extremely low for a guy who is an elite shooter.  His defence has been arguably his weakest points, having one of the worst defensive BPM and defensive rating amongst the Kings roster in the last two years.  RAPTOR impact metrics put his season currently at 224th out of 250 players who played over 200 minutes or bottom ~10% of the league this year. It’s scary and contenders aren’t going to risk it.  If you’re getting paid that much on a team trying to contend you should be either 2nd option like CJ, Kemba/Brown or 3rd option with elite defence or other skill sets  like Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons.   To put it in an example, 76ers could use shooting but they’ll have to give up something like Danny Green + Seth Curry (having a career year) + young asset in either picks or Maxey, Shake or Thybulle? Hard to make an argument for any package for Buddy   Money’s tight when going for the chip."
"If the coach doesn't trust Jrue Holiday to run PnR (your claim, not mine), then that coach is the problem. And coaches absolutely can be the problem even on a good team (see Jackson, Mark)."
"&gt;you don't NEED two superstars, you need a star level player and Middleton is that, and Jrue is an allstar caliber player next to him, that's a great 1-2-3  Outside of the raptors, pistons and mavericks, you won't find a team in the last 20 years that has won with 1 superstar and a guys like Middleton and Holiday who can give you 20 but don't do much else for you offensively."
"Middleton and Holiday are two guys who can score 20 any night, but neither is a legitimate #2 on a championship team. They don't create plays for anyone else. They'll give you 20 but can't get anyone else open looks.   Holiday is a combo guard, Middleton is a nice scoring wing. Neither of them makes the game easier for anyone on the court offensively. They're pretty good at getting their own shots and playing defense but I don't think they help anyone offensively.  These guys are basically CJ Mocullom clones. Can CJ put the ball in the hoop and give you 20 every night? Of course. In an idea situation is he your number 2? Hell no.   People understand that CJ is not a legitimate #2 on a championship team but because Khris and Jrue also play defense,they are magically considered to be legitimate #2s."
"It's really the Bucks offense as a whole that needs to get better. Giannis has one of the [lowest Pick and Roll usage](https://go.nba.com/nkwg) in the league even though he would probably be one of the best PnR roll partners in the league, I would expect a top tier playmaker like Jrue Holiday to make Bud want to run it more but it doesn't seem to be the case.   Also, against the Bucks both the Nets and Lakers shot like 50% from three and only like 30% for the Bucks and the games were still extremely close, if they can get that up to normal too that would be awesome"
Jrue Holiday is unbelievably overrated.
"Such a good point. His agent’s name is Jason Glushon and the list of other players he represents or once did is interesting - Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, and Jaylen Brown are his 4 big contracts all over $100 mil. He also represents Dinwiddie who just signed that $32 mil Bitcoin contract. All his other clients look to be vet min guys but hard to believe he never got Jeff Green paid more."
Redick was pretty damn good last year and wasnt far off his best seasons. We were just stacked with young talent and had Jrue Holiday still which made it harder for him to be a focal point and played 5 mins less a game than he did in Philly because of it  Shot like 45% from 3 with a pretty healthy amount of attempts. He just fell apart this summer
He’s better than Jrue Holiday
Do people really think like this?   The article is just saying use him more off-ball. You have Jrue Holiday and Middleton who are great playmakers
"Despite what people will tell you, it's encouraging. There's been visible tweaks to the offense and defence but the bad habits from the last couple of years sometimes do creep back up such as this in this Lakers game, Bud completely losing his mind with rotations or not using Giannis on the other teams best player but I honestly believe we are a better playoff team than before and matchup well with every east contender.  Also Jrue Holiday is the GOAT."
"I get frustrated when I see that. Or when people talked about Middleton last year not being a traditional 2nd guy. Like what is a traditional 2nd guy? I mean, he isn’t as good as AD I guess. But is as he as good as Paul George? It’s close! This season he averages 22/6/6 on 64% true shooting and good defense. Is there any weakness there? He’s averaging 52/44/92 on 22 a game and 6 assists, where’s his offensive weakness?   And Jrue holiday was constantly spoken of as the most underrated player in the league, a guy who could get you 20/5/7 on all NBA defense. That’s the ultimate 3rd guy. Jrue is better than the 3rd best player on the Lakers, Clippers, 76ers, Heat. Jrue isn’t as good as Kyrie, but the Nets have their own problems."

jrue holiday a pretty man
I might be mistaken but I'm pretty sure he also called Jrue Holiday Earl in the opening minutes of the game tonight.
We lost Jrue Holiday. Maybe in your head you're not realizing just how fuckin good at defense that dude is.   If we're at the same-ish level without him? That's fucking astounding defensive improvement. Maybe frame it like that and it will help you have more patience.
Dort  Gary Trent Jr   Jrue Holiday.   All in the convo too
Jrue Holiday is a pretty decent guard that can shoot and also play defense. They should trade for him
"That Jrue Holiday trade lacks context, they had to bring a good player in to get Giannis to resign. They were pretty much desperate at that point and i’d assume the teams around the league knew that"
Lonzo Josh Hart Melli Bledsoe and Hill for Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday. He’s known in the league as one of the best wing defenders currently.
Unless you think Giannis has made concrete improvements this year I don't see it.  Sure Jrue Holiday helps but he's at most a slight improvement. Giannis is the only one that really can make the team take off.
Jrue Holiday is a huge upgrade over Bledsoe but who knows
Man fuck these blue jerseys...I was like “when the hell did the mavs pick up jrue holiday?” Lololol
"Kyrie at 1, I’m going to put Holiday over Kemba bc of his defense.  Ky   Jrue  Kemba"
"Jrue ""not that much of an upgrade over Bledsoe"" Holiday. Amiright?"
"Yeah, I definitely got too caught up in the jrue holiday addition to see the regression on the bench lol"
Failing to reach the ECF would be catastrophic after what they gave up to acquire Jrue Holiday. It looks like they're a 60+ win quality regular season team again so that'd compound the disappointment.
He was SO NASTY on those teams. Those Sixers teams in general were so fun to watch. The 2011-2012 year in particular was one of my favorites to watch. With a young Jrue Holiday and Lou Williams and Thad Young. Even Vucevic had some good run with that team back then. Plus Elton Brand helping to anchor the inside.
Depends on if they're matched up against Jrue Holiday too.
Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis
Offense:  -	Steph Curry -	James Harden -	Kevin Durant -	LeBron James -	Nikola Jokic  Defense:  -	Jrue Holiday -	Kawhi Leonard -	Ben Simmons -	Giannis Antetekounmpo -	Anthony Davis/Rudy Gobert
"Offense: Steph, Harden, Lebron, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez Defense: Jrue Holiday, Kawhi, Giannis, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez  I feel that this is the only correct list"
Didn’t he have Jrue holiday ?
AMEN! I’ve also noticed a level of new aggression on defense that I think is the Jrue Holiday effect.
"Zach Lavine this year IS better than Jrue Holiday. Hot take?? Maybe, by the end of the season, still maybe lol. I am a Zach Lavine stan tho."
"Udonis Haslem , Rudy gobert, Thad young , Jrue holiday, Rajon rondo , James Johnson"
Again lol. Is scoring your only argument. Well i guess that means that Zach Lavine is way better than Jrue Holiday.
"You could say the same thing on the other end, Jrue Holiday couldn't stop Curry"
No no no. The man who couldn’t even run and was being face guarded by jrue holiday is supposed to go for en efficient 30 every game.
"That’s what’s so crazy to me. If KD’s foot is an inch smaller, who knows what happens to the Bucks organization. Bud likely fired, Jrue Holiday receives major scrutiny, maybe Middleton trade talks, etc.  Bucks have looked so much better these last few games, and as a casual fan I really don’t know what changed for them."
Imagine trading jrue holiday and then next season trading for jrue holiday
"This isn’t context it’s just rationalizations, word context is just devoid of any meaning on here. The rockets had James harden under multiple years left. Not one multiple. Hell Jrue holiday only had one year left. Contenders overpay for stars LAC did for Paul George also which is part of why this is such a joke yhe nets are a win now set up you have an advantage there and instead you get back this junk. Harden had 2 years left 2 years is a lot plenty of contenders can role the dice on 2 years suggesting otherwise is foolish. His list doesn’t matter nearly as much when it’s 2 years left   All teams who trade super stars have compromised leverage to an extent. Houston wasn’t unique. Hell Paul George asked OKC for a trade and they still got a good return. All this is Tillman kicking the can down the road giving himself years to sell false hope and duck the tax. By the time it’s like 2028 all the picks are in and people can see how much this deal sucked nobody will care anymore and people will have moved on. He knows exactly what he’s doing"
The harden return was beyond a joke so they better hope for more it’ll likely go down as the worst return I’ve seen for a superstar in my lifetime. People are just badly overvaluing future nets picks because of the nets/Celtics trade. Literally getting one more pick and one more pick swap than Jrue holiday got back for James harden lmao
Jrue Holiday is toooooo thicccc

Jrue Holiday. He’s still rated highly by fans. But the way I hear someone like KD talk about him makes him sound like the true DPOY.
"so i actually think there’s superstar, star, and all star/all star caliber  superstar - year in year out before the season you could make a case they can win MVP, so lebron, kd, kawhi, steph, harden, luka, jokic, embiid, giannis, dame, ad  star - just below that tier, for example: kyrie, PG (i know he was third that one year but it’s not year in year out from him) jimmy, tatum   allstar/allstar caliber - sabonis type, the lower tier allstars, and then players like jrue holiday who don’t make allstar teams but are the same caliber of player and value as the lower tier allstars"
"Well yeah, booker will probably never get back to the finals.  Kobe would not have let jrue holiday strip him like that smh."
"Just gonna quote a comment of mine from the other day because I don’t wanna find it all again…  &gt; He put up 40/13/5 on 15/24 shooting in game 7 against the Nets, including 7 points on 3/4 in the fourth and one of the Bucks’ two made baskets in OT. Meanwhile the rest of the team shot 38% from the field with Middleton and Holiday combining for **14/49**.  &gt; He scored 31.2% of the team’s points in that series (to KD’s 33.8%), grabbed 23.6% of rebounds (to KD’s 24.4%) and created 19.8% of assists (to KD’s 25.1%), as well as being the team’s defensive anchor. And of course, he won. Despite KD’s best efforts, but it is worth noting for all the carrying he did the only game he won without Kyrie was when Jeff Green and Blake Griffin combined for 44 points on 15/26 shooting (so, the only time he got serious help).  We can look at the rosters on paper forever but in practice, a) KD had Kyrie for three and a half games and that’s where two of their three wins came from and b) Jrue couldn’t hit a layup all series and Middleton came right by the end but looked like total shit for half the series. Forbes and Portis played themselves out of the rotation and Lopez spent most of his time getting abused defensively.   For all our superiority on paper Giannis was the only guy who actually showed up with any consistency and the sheer volume of his contribution shows it pretty clearly."
"Jrue Holiday has been highly rated by other players, with them claiming he is one of the best defenders out there, even tho the media doesn't give him enough love."
"Man you're trippin'  First of all, Butler got covid this year and lost tons and tons of muscle &amp; weight because of it. So its not even like this year is an accurate depiction of his skill.  Second, this guy is clutch, plays good defense. And has shown he can single handedly carry his team in the play offs. Literally having multiple 40 pt games in 1 series . Carrying a team no one believed in to the finals.   Jrue Holiday my ass. Holiday is great but Butler is definitly better.  If Bucks had Jimmy Butler instead of Holiday. I'm pretty sure they prob would have swept the suns"
"The Suns so obviously have no answer for what the Bucks/Bud are trying to accomplish; Jrue Holiday clamping CP3 for 94 feet all game, letting Book’s dumbass score a bunch of points off hero ball thinking he did something, and forcing Ayton to create for himself while also getting him in foul trouble early. All the while Giannis is so incredibly dominant averaging an insane 32/13/5/1/1 with less than 2 TO’s a game on 61% from the field."
"AD drafted by Pelicans. Had Jrue Holiday in his prime. Only made playoffs twice in 7 seasons. Won a ring as a second option in LA.  3/10  KG drafted by Timberwolves. Was MVP, DPOY, Division Champion, Made the playoffs multiple times in his 12 seasons there. Won a ring with the Celtics Big 3. 8/10  Giannis drafted by Bucks. Been MIP, MVP (twice), DPOY. Been conference finalist twice. On the verge of possibly his first ring in his 8th season, aged 26. 9/10  One of these 3 is not like the others. I'll let you figure out which. Good luck drafting"
Lol you don’t go 53 minutes and get to the line 10 times in a playoff game if you’re not even 50%.  Yes definitely wasn’t himself but some of that was Jrue Holiday doing what he does.  Just a discredit to the Bucks to say both were out.
"TJ McConnell recently said that when he plays against Jrue Holiday, he (TJ) feels like a middle schooler trying to get passed him."
Don’t underestimate the ability of Pelicans to screw things up. We had Chris Paul—we did not build a team around him. Same thing with Anthony Davis. Same thing with Zion. We traded Jrue Holiday to the Bucks in some wacky deal also involving the Thunder.
"KD, Lillard, PG, CP3, and many other stars have all said Jrue Holiday is the toughest guard defender in the league. I’ve never actually heard any NBA player say anything negative about Jrue in general.   But then you ask r/nba about their opinion on him as a player, and it’s a completely different story.."
I only started watching the NBA three seasons ago and the first game I saw was the Pelicans. Jrue Holiday went off and has been my favorite player since day 1. I feel like I’ve cheated your rule lol.
I'm sorry does Jrue Holiday play for the Lakers? What does this have to do with literally anything
I watched Jrue Holiday play full court press on Chris Paul as well. That shit tires you out. If you don't play basketball just say so.
Jrue Holiday in a defensive stance. Because Fuck it. There's nobody else.
"Jrue Holiday, not Jew holiday."
"Crazy part is, Jrue, Holiday and Booker will all be joining team USA in like a week lol."
jrue holiday and khris middleton
"Did people really forget game 1 of this series when Chris Paul went to the bench and the trainers surrounded him with towels and then Malika asked him after the game about the injury and he said ""I have no idea what you're talking about"". The dude fucked up his wrist and that's on top of the finger/ligament injury suffered in the other series. Like you said, a top 5 all time point guard doesn't just forget how to dribble a basketball because Jrue Holiday is guarding him lol"
"First off Jrue Holiday is the reason I’m rooting for the Bucks I love that guy.   But he plays hard defense and refs try to set a tone early. He probably should have just had one foul coming out of that, but it is what it is. They did the same thing on Booker early in the game where he should have fouled out 8 times, because they had a quick trigger early and stopped calling things late.   Again, I’m not saying that’s good officiating, but it’s not biased officiating directed by some sinister outside force.   Do you really think if that were the case they would just get Jrue Holiday, who a lot of people would argue is your third best player (#1 in my heart), two early fouls then stop calling them on him the rest of the game?  You can bitch about officiating, lord knows I do all the time, but we gotta stop with the conspiracy nonsense around here."
stealing this from another thread but i really like the jrue “federal” holiday nickname. since he’s shutting everything down.
Wouldn’t that just be ultra-Jrue holiday
"Well DBook is holding opposing players to 45% shooting on 13 defended FGA per game in the Finals, which is better than PJ Tucker (48%), Jrue Holiday (49%), Middleton (53%) and Connaughton (49%) but keep going off with your rancid takes  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PORound=4"
"I’m saying that claiming Giannis is unpolished or unskilled isn’t that wild or that far off when his own contemporaries seem to have the same opinion. And I trust those opinions more, like when they say that Jrue Holiday is one of the toughest defenders in the league, I’m like damn, Jrue must be that kinda good despite not getting any 1st place defensive player of the year votes. Cuz whose opinion really matters? The guys they play against or some sportswriter? For me its the guys they play against."
"Well the result is from the act it’s like when Jordan stripped Malone the strip is not all that impressive, but it’s the whole play. Devin Booker drives he is doubled he turns out to look for the pass and instantly is ripped saying he couldn’t handle the double is dumb. Jrue Holiday made the play and that’s that give the defense the props he risked it all for that play. He leaves CP3 wide open to try and make that play."
"Outside of the 1st game and the 4th quarter last game, he has not made an impact on the series. Jrue Holiday has had a far greater impact than him, and that shouldn't happen."
Jrue “The Glue” Holiday.  This is the way.
"Wasn’t no damn all-time play lol The result was but not the actual act. Meaning, you save your type of explanation for when someone else just does something you can’t. Or if you play tough D but he just makes a tough shot.   Ie Lebron coming out of nowhere to block your shot bc he simply runs and jumps faster and higher than you is out of your hands. Giannis blocking Ayton’s lob is out of Ayton’s hands. Jordan hanging in air while Ehlo can’t is out of Ehlo’s hands.   Jrue Holiday plucking Booker isnt the same. That’s  just bad instincts and tunnel vision. It’s not a ‘well nothing you can do about that’ type of play."
"I'm not saying the Suns are healthy - I'm corrected the argument OP made that the Suns are victims of inexperience facing healthy teams, because they are not facing a healthy team right now. I'm not starting injury one-upmanship, or claiming any dis/advantage, I'm just correcting the statement.  If the Clippers had Jrue Holiday on Chris Paul then I must have missed that. Pat Bev did a great job holding Booker's efficiency low in a way that other players haven't been able to replicate; individual players are individual defenders."
"I didn’t say anything about lying, but the Source is JJ Redick, his own words on his own podcast: https://youtu.be/rujD8EXrXeo  Starts around 10mins in   “Back in November I made a trade request, this is me not my agents”  He wants to go closer to home so wants to be traded. He could have just signed somewhere closer to home in the first place, as he just signed a year prior, but it’s understandable from a human standpoint to want to go home. From a business side, the Pels didn’t get any offers for trades because he was hurt and looked washed. From a business side, they are trying win and build a winner, and he wants them to eat his salary so he can go home. What he should do is retire IMO.   “Jrue is the reason I signed in New Orleans ... i was excited to play with Zion etc ... well truthfully the contract was the best offered to me in FA but the real excitement was to play with Jrue”  He goes on to say the reason is that Jrue can cover for his bad defense, literally.   He asks for a trade once Jrue is gone, Griff says come for a month, if you are still unhappy we’ll get you to a situation you like. Important to note, this is all he says about what was promised. He doesn’t say he was promised a location or a buyout, and he says in the pod he thinks Dallas is a great team with a coach he respects and a place he’d love to play for. But this isn’t desired for him because he’s not prioritizing basketball he just wants to go home. Again, it is my opinion that if that’s the case he should retire and stop chasing buyout money on a contract he signed just a year earlier.   Redick goes on to say he’s handling it directly, not his agents. He says Griff obviously did not honor his word. He thought he’d get bought out if not traded.   From his side, he said it best. He just wanted to see his family on an off day. That’s, again, understandable from a human standpoint. He says he was probably naive about the whole thing (which he very obviously is). The only offer the Pels got for him was from Dallas, so they took it. They didn’t do anything wrong by doing that and for him to go on his pod and call the FO dishonest is pretty petty when they literally shipped him to a better place for the last few months of the season (the Pels packed it in and didn’t make the playoffs vs the Mavs who have an older, more established team in the playoffs) and if he wanted to be home he could have just signed near home, or retired. He makes the point at least 3-4 times that Dallas is a good desirable basketball situation.   He goes on to answer a question about honesty and integrity (clearly a soft pitch Q) and says it’s not an opinion that you won’t get honesty out of New Orleans’ FO and his agents and agency will never trust them again. This is just silly and salty, given that he made the point multiple times that he tried to do this without his agents.   The Pels clearly worked with Jrue Holiday, who also requested a trade, to send him to a contender, yet he says it’s not an isolated incident with the Pels FO.  His standpoint is understandable, but his criticism of the Pels doesn’t have any legs IMO and his public criticisms and Twitter antics are petty."
"Even people on this sub have been saying it for years.  Jrue Holiday is the easiest ""how do I know you watch/follow basketball"" test."
"If Chris Paul's team is playing great and the teammates he dishes out to make their shots, then everything is fine. When the team is struggling however, he rarely has the ability to take over. Again, unfortunately his size plays into it.  Defensively, he's smart but his size and lack of length compromises him on that end as well. It says a lot that Jrue Holiday has had a larger impact on the series than he has..."
They said Jrue Holiday beat the Eric Bledsoe allegations😂😂
It’s so weird to think that if Durant was just a hair further back Bud is fired and we are spending the summer calling the Jrue Holiday trade a failure and “what’s wrong with the bucks” is a big offseason storyline.
Kd prolly wouldve won with a jrue holiday and middleton level player vs not playing but occupied salary space

"If you're the Suns, losing two straight games where the following things happened is just brutal:  -Booker over 40 pts both games  -20/42 on 3s over both games  -Jrue Holiday shoots 20% on 20 shots (4/20) in G4  -Bench players shoot 16/28 over both games  You just can't come out of a stretch like that 0-2"
"I'm trying lad i reall am lol how about you give us Jrue holiday for frank Kaminsky the 3rd? sound like a fair trade?????   I'm just salty lol congrats if you win it in 6 you'll have definitely deserved it if you do in fact win it🤝, i pray you don't tho lol"
"giannis is making it sound like jrue holiday is terminally ill and only has days to live, “it takes a lot out of his body”"
"Because they had to be playing incredible basketball to go up by 16. The other things (intangibles) are the Bucks bread and butter. During our series against them it became annoyingly clear that they don’t win from offense. They are all good on the glass their entire 1-5 starting and then Bobby Portis off the bench all crash the glass very well, they are known for their defense with not only Giannis but Jrue Holiday, Lopez is a certified paint protector (not bpg but ofg% in the paint) by holding opposing players to an entire 11% below their averages around the rim. They are a huge team and Pat and Tucker both are those types of dudes willing to give everything they got every single possession ( loose balls, offensive rebounding, straight hustle dudes ) . I’m not sayin there is no chance for the Suns, but so far the Bucks haven’t been playing their best offensive basketball - compared to what we saw against ATL - and are still up 3 - 2 because of the intangibles. This is why I said what I said, because if you’re going to beat the Bucks, it will not be because you out hustles or outrebounded them"
"Your franchise is trash and you’re going to lose Zion just like you lost AD and Zion is going to win a championship as soon as he leaves the garbage Pelicans just like how AD and soon to be Jrue Holiday did before him. Lonzo Ball is gone next year and no one is going to take trash Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe off your books, enjoy being a fan of a trash franchise and stupid as hell you said 25% and then said “oh he improved to 36%” aka you don’t even watch the games of the team you support cause that’s the only reason you would be incorrect about how JJ Redick has been playing all year LMAO."
you had me at:  &gt;arguably the greatest actor of all time Nicholas Cage.  Jrue The Cage Holiday
I'd rather have good players on good contracts when I trade away Jrue Holiday. I am just not gonna let you act like it's somehow a win if you lose 2-4 1st rounders trying to turn Bledsoe/Adams into positive contract contributors that fit the team.

"I was like 8 when I saw Michael Cooper play live. I really loved him, though, despite being a Celtics fan. The coach on our youth team had a schtick where he compared  everything to Michael Cooper. Be a team player like Michael Cooper. Be a good sport like Michael Cooper. Always be moving when you play defense like Michael Cooper.  Anyway, watching these finals, Jrue Holiday makes me think of Michael Cooper. I don't really know if that's my childlike-impression, though"
"Yup, guys like jrue holiday and kawhi come to mind. Not being able to get pushed around is such an overlooked defensive trait."
"Superteams have existed since the beginning of nba history.   Plus, you're only talking about Giannis/Booker. Tell me how the Bucks got Jrue Holiday? Khris Middleton? How did the Suns get CP3?"
"A superteam hasn't won since 2018.   Both these current teams in the finalls basically have their own big 3s, and Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and CP3 are not ""loyal guys"" drafted by these teams."
G - Mike Conley  G- Jrue Holiday  F- Andre Iguodala  F- Andre Kirilenlo  C -Tyson Chandler  Nobody's scoring on this team
&gt;I love Jrue Holiday but he is the classic example of the guy that is only good when he's interested.   Mind explaining this one?
"Bucks were also penetrating at will when Ayton sat and later when he was on the floor too. Jrue ""Literally Bledsoe"" Holiday, according to Suns fans, was having his way with anyone who was guarding him and the Suns were whining to the refs rather than getting back on D anyway."
Everybody always looks at Jeff Hornacek and overlook him. I love Jrue Holiday but he is the classic example of the guy that is only good when he's interested.   But you make a good point.
"Trying to avoid the young guys like Jaylen Brown or Trae Young who will almost certainly get another AS nod.  C: Kristaps Porziņģis  PF: Meta World Peace  SF: Josh Howard  SG: Jrue Holiday  PG: Goran Dragic  &amp;#x200B;  Great defensive team. Okay spacing, MWP and Howard could both hit 3s and Holiday and Dragic are decent 3PT guys, All Star Porziņģis was a 40% 3PT shooter and averaged 23 ppg Dragic has shown he can be a 21 ppg guy, let him go off. Everyone on this team can shoot the 3, you have two ball handlers, a great rim protector in Porziņģis and elite defenders in MWP and Holiday. If healthy (big if with Josh Howard, and Porziņģis) this team would win 60+ games IMO."

Jrue Holiday is my spirit animal
Jrue Holiday is a fringe all-star and hasn't made one in like 10 years. Even Middelton isn't a certified All-Star. Let's not go down this route.
You know it's bad when Jrue Holiday is going to make an impact on this team and not dame
Jrue Holiday is going to make a huge impact on this team.
"Jrue Holiday, Donte DiVincenzo, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez.   Jeff Teague, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis."
Does anyone really care about all time rankings outside of the top 10? Like who would take pride in Jrue Holiday being top 150 ever lol
I mean shit the star power is so lacking this year that Khris Middleton and Booker going 40 to 40 every game is just an example of how ASS they are. Then you got Jrue holiday stepping up recently but who cares cuz Kyrie lol. Giannis averaging 40 and 12 and getting Lebron type blocks every game but who gives a shit cuz we like the sound of KD vs Bron 🤩
"It's quite hard not to be bias and defnisve when you feel like it's you vs the majority of nba sub redidit and twitter, and please dont act like ginnias has never fouled or did something Dirty his whole career I just want the same energy for everyone man, jrue holiday is a cheat code also lol dude  kept them in that game"
Jrue Holiday was the missing piece. I'm really rooting for the Bucks to close it out. There's no one on that team that I don't like.
"Yeah, nor should they. That kind of play happens all the time and the refs never call fouls on it. It's the same thing as plays that lead to jump balls being called, where two players are fighting for the ball. This idea that there should be absolutely zero contact between the two players or else it's a foul is silly.   Booker made a mistake by dribbling into traffic and not noticing Holiday coming from his blind side, so when he turned into Jrue he exposed the ball and got it stripped. That was great defensive anticipation by Jrue and a mistake by Booker. The last thing we as fans should want is for the refs to punish that good defense and reward a mistake on offense."
"&gt; The refs didn't provide an explanation.   They don't provide an explanation on the vast majority of calls and especially don't do so on no calls. Were you looking for them to stop the game and make some kind of announcement as to why they didn't call a foul there?  Just accept that it was a clean strip, as any other clean strip is. Booker dribbled into trouble and when he turned he didn't see Holiday there and he exposed the ball and Jrue ripped it away from him. I know you desperately wanted your team to win, but if the refs start calling a clean strip like that a foul then that will ruin the game. Booker made a mistake and Jrue played great defense. At some point you need to look to your team to just play better rather than hoping and expecting the refs to just give it to you when it isn't deserved."
"I’ll never forget 13 years ago when jrue holiday single handedly decimated our high school bball team when we made the state semi finals. Being the same age &amp; witnessing him live, I’ve followed &amp; watched him get better every single year. Now he’s on the verge of being a NBA champion in which he’s contributing an immense amount. I’m proud as hell!"
"The Clippers didn’t even try to guard Luka with Kawhi or PG until late in the series... not to mention the Bucks are a better defensive team (regular season and playoffs). Jrue Holiday, Giannis, and PJ/Middleton to help is kinda okay I guess???   The point is that at 24, DBook is putting up legendary performances IN THE FINALS. This sub stroked Luka for weeks after his amazing performances in the first round. People hate DBook for whining to the refs and getting calls, Luka is the worst in the league at that stuff. There’s clearly a massive dissonance there somewhere."
Lol yeah the Bucks just need to have Giannis Jrue and Middleton all drop 30 and they can barely squeak out the win due to a steal from Jrue Holiday. Shit ain’t happening again bud
"Again with the Bud hate, you amazing fans don't deserve a ring just because of the pure brainlessness on shitting on a coach despite not knowing a single thing about coaching  Bud made Jrue Holiday go 4/14 and 7/21, Middleton 5/16 right?   I bet you will say some generic shit like adjustments now"
"Man im so happy for the bucks. When they got Jrue, a lot of people were clowning them for giving up so much, for not trying hard enough to get Chris Paul, for the whole Bogdanavic situation. People were talking about how it could be a bad fit ith Holiday's shooting struggles at times.   But I always loved Jrue's game, always love how Middleton plays, and how can you not root for Giannis? The guy is very likable and such has such great rags to riches story for him and his family.   I really thought Jrue Holiday would be a great fit for them, and I really wanted them to prove me right. And they absolutely did. Luck is involved in every postseason, but the Bucks just have so much talent."
Jrue holiday had one good 9ffensive game in this finals and people lose their minds. Klay defends like that and scores 20-25 on good efficiency..
Here's a list of all stars that were drafted by small market teams in the past 20 years (MVPs in bold):  * Zion * Donovan Mitchell * Bam * Sabonis * KAT * LaVine * **Jokic** * Oladipo * **Giannis** * Gobert * AD * Lillard * Drummond * Middleton * Kyrie * Kemba * Vucevic * Kawhi * Isaiah Thomas * Cousins * Hawyward * PG * **Harden** * Tyreke Evans * **WB** * Love * Hibbert * Lopez * Dragic * **Durant** * Conley * Roy * Rondo * Lowry * Millsap * Bogut * Deron * CP3 * Granger * Dwight * Emeka Okafor * Deng * Jameer Nelson * **Lebron** * Melo * Wade * David West * Mo Williams * Kyle Korver * Amare * Caron Butler * Boozer  Here are those drafted by big markets (top 10: https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/)  * Trae * Tatum * Ben Simmons * Ingram * Jaylen Brown * Porzingis * D'Angelo Russell * Embiid * Randle * Siakam (I think Toronto is a pretty damn big market) * Beal * Dray * Klay * Butler * Wall * Griffin * **Steph** * DeRozan * Jrue Holiday * Jeff Teague * Rose * DeAndre Jordan * Horford * Noah * Gasol * Aldridge * Bynum * Lee * Devin Harris * Iguodala * Al Jefferson * Bosh * Kaman * Josh Howard * Yao Ming  **A lot more all stars and a lot more superstars were drafted by small market teams.**
Booker should have robbed an armored car and bribed Adam silver with the stolen money to call the officials so they would call it a foul on jrue holiday.   But hindsight is 20/20
Jrue Holiday can play fucking ball
&gt;Nicholas Cage has starred in the movie National Treasure. National Treasure is a movie about stealing the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence was adopted on the 4th of July. The 4th of July is a federal Holiday and you know what else is a Holiday? Jrue Holiday. Some would say this is destiny  this logic is as flawless as the National Treasure movies  great post
Jrue “Federal” Holiday   Reggie “Big Government” Jackson    John “Bicameral Legislature” Collins
"Lebron choking 2011 is the extreme, not the standard.   &gt;Choking isn't guys who are now guarded at the highest level and each shot is tough   If you can't grab a bucket when your team needs it, you are choking. ""Jrue Holiday played excellent defense on Chris Paul, that shouldn't be ignored."" Fuck outta here. The best players get criticized for not being able to score when the team needs it the most. There's none of this ""I did my part. I was just guarded very closely.""     I'm surprised someone who went to medical school lacks the brain stem to understand competition. Just goes to show any idiot can be successful in society"
"The defence hasn’t been anything special jrue holiday has just been missing easy open shots, especially layups. He just seemingly made them this game"
"Also, that loss has to hurt bad for Book. He played out of his mind, young man with back to back 40+ games in his first finals appearance. That's greatness right there. To lose the ball by getting stripped by a veteran jrue holiday and to ultimately lose the game when clawing back to being down 1 with 20ish seconds left hurts BAD. Expect him to go nuclear again next game. Actually I'm gonna go and bet his over on points now that I think of it."
"Jrue Holiday was getting some shit in the series against us because sometimes the eye test against him doesn’t hold up like it does against Giannis, but my god do stats love this man"
Jrue holiday is pretty good at basketball
"What a silly, stupid comment at the end. Drafting a generational player like Giannis and KEEPING him during his prime is extremely challenging for small markets when big time free agents don’t sign with you ever. They had to trade a shit ton just to get Jrue Holiday, and the result is that they might scrape by in the most injury plagued playoffs in NBA history."
With all due respect Jrue Holiday locked the fuck out of Booker in the 4th. I mean you are somewhat right about Paul and Ayton but Tucker  can be a better option because he can switch better on Ayton then Jrue. You guys already switching the Ayton screen anyways. Tucker can’t keep up with Booker but he can keep up with Paul better and use his size to contest the mid range. I mean it’s working because when Booker drops 40 y’all are winning. It just sucks that If Bud put Jrue on Booker the whole game he would not be as dominant.
"What, because Jrue Holiday made an all-star game one time 8 years ago? You know damn well that's not comparable to the level Kyrie and Love were at in 2014, why pretend?  Honestly I'm surprised this is controversial, are there really people who thought Lebron/Kyrie/Love wasn't a superteam? Next you're gonna tell me Miami's big 3 wasn't a superteam."
You’re welcome. The Jrue Holiday trade started the process for the Sixers. And now he’s about to win it all.
"I agree. Even if the Bucks win the title it was due more to luck then actually front office consistency.   They f ed up the offseason in 2019 but 1 not being willing to pay the tax. They could of gotten everyone back including Brogdon. And they can get a trade exception.   They go into next year with Bledsoe, Brogdon and everyone back. Minus a few bench pieces we didn't need. They probably lose again.   You can make the trade for Holiday and keep Brogdon at SG. Use Donte instead for in exchange the first Rd pick Indy gave them.   They also screw up contract stuff not knowing Jrue has contract incentives and that blows up the Bogi trade.   Then they make an assanine signing off 34 year old DA.   They got lucky Portis turned out well and Donte took a small leap.   If they are Daryl Morey they have a starting 5 of Brogdon, Holiday, Middleton, Giannis, Brook  And a backup of Portis, Tucker.   That's a hell of a lot better what they have now.   Plus they get there 2nd back.   Am I cranky at Host yes. Does this play out like it does in my mind probably not.   But if we didn't have cheap fucking owners and a decent GM this team is in much better spot for competitive title window."
"Pro or not, Jrue looked like prime MJ vs some highschool kids,   Anyone in the video stood out to you? Ye same here, Jrue Holiday did."
Shit man you can say that about any player Jrue Holiday cost the Bucks 2 games if hey play an average game the series would be over.
"Jrue? They just got him this year, but regardless the offense runs through Giannis. You might want to check the usage stats. Even Middleton handles the ball more than Holiday."
"Kawhi, Draymond Green, Jrue Holiday."
Somebody needs to make a Jrue Holiday chief keef pasta
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."
"small sample size theater &amp; also games vs. the #2 overall defense in the NBA, PG13/Kawhi/Pat Bev, Jrue Holiday &amp; a 48 point blowout of OKC where Dame played 25 minutes"
"Doncic teammates let him get the boards to pad his stats. Doncic is not a good rebounder. Doncic is a great passer and good at getting to the bucket and scoring. Doncic is not a good shooter. There are plenty of players who can do what Doncic does but I'll name 5 other than Russell Westbrook for you. Ben Simmons, SGA, LaMelo Ball, Jrue Holiday, Ja Morant."
Jrue Holiday or Caris LaVert.   Athletic guards who can both shoot the ball &amp; defend. Both starters as well.
Ninja Headband Jrue Holiday
"Jrue Holiday and Pat Bev missing in a sweep and gentlemans sweep lol. And Conely with the mask, if that's what you're talking about. The only significant altering difference that could have been made was in the Finals tbh."
Jrue Holiday and Andrew Bynum
no worries Im that way with any Holiday brother other than Jrue
"&gt; process without tanking  I mean they traded away their best players similar to Sixers, it's just that their cupboard actually gave a return. The Sixers had Jrue Holiday and nothing since the Bynum trade took every other good asset."
"Fine, call him a 2.   Jrue. FVV. Jaylen. Jimmy. Danny Green. Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2--is it Holiday now? Josh Richardson. Will Barton. Rozier. Derrick White. Lonzo. That's 13.   Sterling Brown, if you count him as the Rockets 2. I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson, too.   Depending on which guy you consider a team's 2, the list changes. If you want to go just ""wings"" in general, it's even harder for me to consider him in that top-24 (because so many of the worst defenders in the league are starting 2s)"
"Jayson -----&gt; Jaylen -----&gt; Randle. What next, Jrue Holiday?"
&gt; If last year we got AD and John Wall with a solid group of role players you telling me they can't win it all vs that heat team?  They would either miss the playoffs or lose in the first round.  AD and Jrue Holiday won 34 games in 2017 and Holiday was light years ahead of where Wall is today.
"Have you ever considered that the super teams have been forming exclusively to beat Jrue Holiday? Think about it.   First, Holiday is drafted in 2009 onto the 6ers. Naturally, due to the threat his existence posed to LeBron, he made the most hated superteam of all time in order to have a shot at taking him down.  Then, in 2013, he moved west. Naturally, due to the threat Holiday posed to the western stronghold, KD made the bitchiest move of all bitch moves so he could have a shot against the Jrue. Finally, this year, he moved back east. Because of this, KD and Kyrie spam called Harden until he requested a trade to finally put a stop to Jrue."
"What superstar hasn't played gm though? lebron and harden have both forced teams to trade costars for them, steph famously recruited kd, giannis got jrue holiday after meeting with the bucks owner. Superstars in the NBA consistently are more able to distill their talent than other sports because they have the leverage."
Can someone give me a breakdown on how Jrue Holiday would do this?
"The best teams just have good midrange shooters, I don’t think there is a correlation. Clippers- Kawhi and PG, who are very good at the midrange. Suns have cp3 and book. 76ers have Harris and Embiid. Nuggets have Jokic and Murray. Bucks have Middleton and Jrue holiday, and Bobby Portis is also shooting the midrange for them"
Tbh two of those were against the prime warriors and nurkic was out for 2019. Man got straight outplayed by Jrue holiday in 2018 though
"Different standards and different expectations  However if i have to say anything, its that Jrue Holiday is better than both of them"
Is Wiseman better than Jrue Holiday?
the gap between curry and trae defensively is about the same as the gap between jrue holiday and curry defensively lol
"I thought it was funnier that he said ""that's why he says he's the greatest defender that's ever lived, if you can guard a guy like jrue holiday..""  Jrue is a very good player but that shit was hilarious"

Pelicans should've stolen him while they had the chance last year with Jrue Holiday. I know Denver was reluctant but after the bubble he had the worst PR. Denver has a great core and they will be scary.
"What we all missed is how he got Jrue fucking Holiday doing a 360 before buttfumbling and still draining the 30-footer, didn’t even touch the net."
Jrue Holiday was giving me Vietnam flashbacks
"Against really tough defense from Jrue Holiday all game. Even with Draymond out at the end of the game, Steph carried this team to victory.   Steph is just relentless."
jrue holiday is so fucking good its unreal
39 pts on 20 shots while banged up going up against Jrue Holiday  Not bad
Jrue Holiday
"Wait, are you implying Simmons is better then Jrue Holiday?  So random lol"
And we came back from 18 down against Bucks and defended Giannis pretty well. They needed Jrue Holiday to kill us with 2 seconds left. We lost to them by 1.
Yeah I think Jrue Holiday can do this better tho
2009:  Steph Curry  James Harden  Demar DeRozan  Blake Griffin  Taj Gibson  6th man: Jrue Holiday
That was a very Jrue Holiday-esque move
Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley the most underrated players of all time if you look at the definition of underrated you see their pics.  So underrated
I need to get me a Jrue Holiday jersey. Forever one of my favorite non-Knicks in the league.
Jrue Holiday
Jrue holiday not taking someone that's useless in half court
"He’s not better, Jrue Holiday is an elite defender but is also a capable scorer/shooter. Simmons size and playmaking advantage don’t make up for those gaps in talent."
"If you think Lillard is better than Curry than you need to stop talking about basketball forever because that’s an indefensibly bad opinion to have   Lillard finally has 1 season almost as good as Curry in the regular season and people forgot about all the previous years, the previous years of absolutely destroying Lillard in the postseason and Lillard getting clamped by Jrue holiday   As recent as 2019 Curry with no Durant/Barnes at the small forward spot, an older a slightly declined iggy and the worst depth in the NBA still swept Lillard and his blazers and it wasn’t even close     Lillard is a top 7-8 player and awesome but he has quite literally no argument over Curry."
"They are about even. After Jrue has a good game, he’s ahead of Simmons and then Simmons has a good game and overtakes Holiday"
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
The year is 2071. 80 year old Jrue Holiday suits up for his 3700th game.
"I see you couldn’t provide source?  Go take a look at individual RAPM seasons, and you’ll see that massive amounts of outliers. The 19-20 season all has Aaron Holiday, Jrue Holiday and Siakam ranked in the top 10. AD the guy who was first team all NBA is ranked in the 20s after Lou Williams at 13 and just after Kevin Love at 19. And that’s just a few. No model is perfect but that is ridiculous.  I could go on. No one. And I mean no one uses single seasons rating of RAPM to mean anything. The RAPTOR guys recommend no period less than 5 years. Goldstein said minimum 7.  And no one said any of these stats are perfect. But the whole point of RAPTOR and Lebron is that they use shorter time to stabilize. Lebron is ranked poorly defensively in both of them.   Yeah there is pretty big difference between 9 and 1 buddy. Being the 6 best defensive center in the league and being number 1 is pretty fucking different.  I mean if he says LEBRON is an elite defender when none of the advanced models say so, then he is saying his own (and everyone else’s) models suck.  Why would you take your own eye test? Are you an NBA scout? Do you watch the all 10 footage and know what the defensive plays are, and who messed up? You are the one who said to compare it to the eye test not me."
"Will be the 15th highest paid guard next season, name 15 guards better than Jrue holiday"
"worth every penny, Jrue mfin Holiday"
"bucks fans are a little too quick to say he's only making 30-32 mil and he wasnt getting the full 4yrs 172mil supermax from anyone but decent chance he doesnt make the 4yrs 160mil either.  It all depends on the incentives which could be easy or hard.    Unless jrue falls off a cliff, mil should be a contender for 2+ years.  At least for those 2 years, holiday's deal only is bad for the owners and the luxury tax and they wont regret much.  I dont think giving him a bit less money creates any room to make moves in free agency.    It could definitely be bad by year 3 but by then khris is an expiring and might still be tradeable for a better player but even if he's not, it's just 2 bad years til holiday expires and then bucks can retool around giannis.  Ofc you wish holiday was a bit cheaper since that makes him more tradeable too when you get to the last year or two."
&gt;JRUE HOLIDAY IS NOT WORTH 40 MILLION A YEAR  He is if he get all NBA and wins multiple championships which is the only way hes getting $40M a year.
"Different situations  Small markets always pay up and Milwaukee had no choice of not maxing out Jrue after the ransom they paid   Iggy specifically chose to go to Golden State, if he wanted a bigger role &amp; money, he would've gone somewhere else.   Could've done that decision in the off-season, instead of *in the middle of a playoff series*, but it's all good  Also Jrue Holiday is a fucking killer. When stars call him the best on ball defender in the league, they're not lying. That dude deserves to get compensated"
"While I agree, I think this is a little bit different of a case because you have players comparing two players in the nba at the current time, both of which guard the players making this statement.  It’d be one thing if there was a bit of a split among the NBA players, but it seems pretty forward when Lillard, Durant, Beal, McCollum, Chris Paul, etc, all come out and say Jrue Holiday.  That being said, I do agree with your statement about nba players having some opinions on the goat debate that don’t make sense.  I think this jrue/Ben statement though has a little more basis for an argument since you can really 1:1 compare them with who they play against and those players opinions on that."
interesting considering 30 year old jrue holiday who’s not any better than iggy just got a 4 year max.  as if iggy didn’t deserve more at 30 lol.  and by interesting i meant ironic
"He also could’ve held Horst’s feet to the fire to get that money from us. Jrue knew that a) we would have to and were planning on paying the tax for him and b) we mortgaged our future on him staying, and basically had to pay him whatever he wanted.  In a situation where he had 100% of the leverage he left between $60-100m on the table to stay here long term and not hamstring the franchise.  I fucking **love** Jrue Holiday."
Jrue Holiday just got 160 because the Bucks are capped out after Middleton got 140 because the Bucks were capped out.  Schroder has the Lakers by the balls.
Absolutely untrue. Who acknowledges that? Where was all this jrue holiday hype before the trade to Milwaukee? There wasn’t any. And I’m a fan of him and his game.
Well Jrue is playing better since the break and just got a 160 mill deal so of course everyone is going to say him lol  All seriousness rn maybe Holiday by a hair if that. But all together Ben is the more valuable player/assets is much younger and more versatile with way higher potential.  Jrue isn’t better than Giannis because he can shoot? Similar with Ben. Ben not on Giannis level of impact but similar builds and unicorn ability.
"They should trade Luka for Jrue Holiday. Giannis, and Luka. I would want Jokic, but I feel like Luka and Jokic are both great passers, maybe they work great. Not a basketball savant. However, I do not care what team those 3 on, just that they are on the same team."
Back in his rightful conference. Back to reclaim his throne. The Jruth. Jrue Holiday.
"Shut the fuck up. Remember when the Blazers won 3 titles? Me neither. Also I assumed you meant Iguadola because I was talking about 2019, where Kevin Durant was injured for 3 of the 4 series that they played. Should I bring up how Lillard got outplayed by Jrue Holiday and lost to the Pelicans?"
Fred Vanvleet or Jrue Holiday?
"if someone gave Jrue Holiday a quarter of a billion dollars, they may have reassess their financial decisions in life"
"&gt;The 3 pt% for Ingram doesn’t matter much on so few attempts.  Yes, it does.  A percentage is a percentage, and it is not easier to shoot less frequently.  In fact, it's way easier to shoot when you are the unquestioned number one option on a team, and cannot be benched -- both luxuries Ingram never had in Los Angeles.  &gt;Ft% is the best indicator of shooting and he jumped from high 60s in la to 85% in no.   Not if the player still misses from the field at the same rate.  The best indicator of shooting is the percentage the player shoots -- Ingram's effective FG% rose less between his 3rd and 4th seasons than between his 2nd and 3rd.  &gt;They be deeper but not better offensively. Ball and hart don’t add that much offensive value and are taking away minutes from others.   Ball ( 12/7 on 55% effective ) is an upgrade over Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Alex Caruso, and Dion Waiters.  Hart ( 10/2 on 53% effective plus 7 rebounds ) is better than a couple of those guys, too.  &gt; New Orleans but he didn’t have great help most years outside jrue   Anderson/Evans/Gordon/Holiday should be enough for Davis to reliably make the playoffs.  It was not.  Most years, they weren't even close.  &gt;  If ad misses a buzzer beater it’s 3-2.   And if he shoots better than 11 for 23, a buzzer beater isn't necessary.  More to the point, there's no reason Ingram, Ball, Hart, or some other Laker could not have hit those shots.  It's not like Davis is a good three-point shooter -- he's worse than all those guys.  &gt;There is nothing to outbid for Miami, butler got a max contract with them.   There was still a trade that required matching or beating.  The point is, Butler would've been a Laker if Davis wasn't.  And no one was beating James + Butler + Ingram + the deepest team in the league.  They might've swept the playoffs.  And that team would be even more unbeatable this season, and for years to come, and would still have most of their draft picks.  &gt; traded is irrelevant, brogdon wanted to go there.   Apart from a few years of the Kobe Bryant era, no player has ever not wanted to be a Laker.  In the unlikely event that Brogdon did not, the Lakers still had tons of depth and assets to trade for a litany of other players."
Jrue Holiday is the main reason you *shouldnt* vote us out lol. He’s like the most wholesome human being in the NBA and you’d be an asshole to vote his team out
"Him and Jrue Holiday blow my mind when they play slow like that. I'm trying to think of other guys who do it regularly. They're not actually slow, they just understand positioning and what defenders have vision of, and take advantage of it instead of trying to outplay people with pure forehead athleticism."
"You're essentially using a 8 game stretch to justify why he's worth more than $30 million plus. Let me ask you this way: is Jrue Holiday the 32nd best player in the NBA? I'd say that's about where he resides, hence fair contract. There are better players making less, and worse players making more."
"I love the dude and im happy to heae it, but i think the Bucks miiiiiiight regret that when a 35 year old Jrue Holiday is getting paid ~45 mil in the last year of that deal"
Remove the max contract. Jrue Holiday making as much as guys like Harden and Curry is so fucked.
"Bruh the Bucks aren't winning anything, Jrue Holiday isn't boosting their chances...u do realize that right?"
Lmao Jrue Holiday is the perfect PG for the bucks and you saying that shows you haven’t watched them at all.
"For fuck sake, setting aside that CP3 is very obviously a more valuable player than Jrue Holiday...when CP3 signed his extension, he was playing on a team that a lot of people thought could've took down the superteam Warriors without him goin down. He was the second best player on that team. The only issue was injuries...there was a realistic expectation of a good shot at a ring.  Paul now has one year left on that deal and is still highly valuable, currently helping boost the Phoenix Suns, who missed the playoffs last year...to a top 2 seed in the West and contender. This is rudimentary"
"30 years old is supposed to be this big scary age for a NBA player now?  Kawhi is gonna be 30 in 2 months, what idiot team is going to MAX him?  Anyways, the Bucks are fine. They have their 3 best players, one an MVP and two All-Star caliber players locked up.  They will try to assemble the best team possible around them for the next 3 years.  And they have no 1st rounders to deal because they dealt them to build the team. That's obvious.  ""They need those FRP to deal for a player like Jrue Holiday"""
For Jrue holiday? Milwaukee are wilding.
"Is it controversial to think that current basketball skillset/ability goes to Jrue Holiday?  CP3 has some intangibles in leadership and IQ while not being a slouch on the court himself which makes him arguably more valuable/a better player.  But if you just had, like, skill sliders for players, Jrue's would be higher"
"If Jrue wins this, I nominate Jrue Holiday to replace Ben Simmons for the neverending who is better Ben Simmons or Player X series."
"I said “not *as much* of an overpay” lol  But small market teams have to pay a premium to keep guys. Plus they’re over the cap anyways. It sucks, but it’s how it works. Jrue Holiday is a hell of a player though."
33 million a year for Jrue Holiday isn't overpaying? Lol
"When I think of guys who feel like they're been around forever and yet aren't that old, Jrue Holiday is the first name on that list."
We need to start putting Jrue Holiday in these conversations
&gt;And jrue can't be a third star.  Lmao how many teams have a better third star than Jrue Holiday?
"Mentally I'm still used to 2014 salary cap where the highest paid players made 20-24 million per year so every time a great (but not elite) player like Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton and now Jrue Holiday gets a bag this big, my mouth always drops."
Jrue Holiday is a fantastic 30 year old PG in the middle of his prime.  That's why they're not letting him walk.
"Jrue Holiday played in the WEST in its peak of guards like CP3, Curry, Klay, Lillard. I guarentee you Jrue would be a multiple time all star if he was in the east. Its irrelevant, Jrue is better."
"&gt;the owners where loosing money  I've yet to see any numbers to show the Process Sixers were actually losing the league significant amounts of money.  The Iguodala and Jrue Holiday teams were not major draws, home or away, and didn't get many national TV games during that time."
"Jrue signing the contract has 0 correlation to other PGs  It never matters, contracts don't get compared like that   It's team, player and context depended, in this case Lakers are hard capped and losing Schroder for nothing is bad because they can't replace him, that's the reason he will get more money not because Jrue Holiday who was traded and was  maxed  before this as well signed that contract"
FVV has never been on the same level as Jrue Holiday.  Quit wasting time
With that sort of money he can go on a jrue holiday
Jrue Holiday a ‘star’... 👌🏼
"in what world is Jrue Holiday at 6'4"" as valuable as Ben Simmons defensively? you're underplaying Bens DPOY level impact to fit the narrative that Jrue is worth taking 10/10 times. Jrue is better than Ben Simmons on how many teams in the NBA out of 30? I think more teams take Ben than Jrue. like 18-12 or so."
"Pelicans fans understand the impact of Jrue Holiday... especially as a small market team. Worth every penny, and I can’t wait for the world to see him shut down the best opposing player for a full series."
Paying $40 million for Jrue Holiday in his ages 33 and 34 seasons is disastrous.
I'm giving Siakam 30m well before I'm giving Jrue Holiday 40m....
"Why? Let’s say Butler is retained, KAT is traded for Jrue Holiday.  Now let’s say Butler and Jrue push into playoffs, but come short.  Now, wolves have opportunity to win the 2019 NBA draft in tournament form. Oh, hey, they win and draft Zion.    It’s easy to make up shit and consider how this could be an interesting model."
So when it's all said and done Jrue Holiday will have made $300 million+ from the NBA...  a guy that made 1 all star team and plays All NBA level defense.  Is it a bit weird that Jrue Holiday might end his career with more earnings than Harden (yes Harden did turn down a $50 million contract)
because jrue holiday is a better basketball player than chris paul
"If not for the Malcolm Brogdon trade, there wouldn’t be a 2020 Pacers 1st round pick for the Bucks to trade for Jrue Holiday."
If jrue holiday is a bum then you’re subhuman
Even if it spikes I still don't see paying Jrue Holiday 40 million as a 34 year old being a steal.
he makes 25m/year what are you talking about?  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/milwaukee-bucks/jrue-holiday-6316/cash-earnings/
"Jrue Holiday, 40 million a year  Just say those words out loud"
Schroder is closer to Eric Bledsoe than he is to Jrue Holiday
If youo want damian lillard youre gunna have to give up a lot more than just jrue holiday
Jrue Holiday
The difference is that Giannis isn't playing on one leg and missing Jrue Holiday.
Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt; Jrue Holiday
Pat Bev just did what Jrue Holiday was doing to Harden last night... fouling a dude with a bumb leg at half court. Literally made no sense. lol
"He is not being exploited in this series though. He is way more efficient than the rest of his team.  His team is shooting 50% TS, he shoots 57%.  His play style seems the least exploitable when compared to his teammates'.  You mean the system he plays in is exploitable. In that I agree, because no way are Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday shorting in thiers 40s (TS) under any other system."
Y’all swear up and down that Jrue Holiday/Milddleton aren’t good enough to be second options and think Seth Curry is 2nd option good?
Jrue holiday has been bad on offense this series. His defense has been great.... but airballing mid range jumpers and the amount of turnovers he has is disappointing
"Giannis suffers from some weird iteration of relapsing/remitting dumbfuckitis.   Sometimes he’s a fucking closer beast that dominates the entire game and lifts the value of everyone around him.   And sometimes he gets a perfect iso matchup and decides to take a low% fade away midrange over a notoriously not great defender that’s literally hobbled, turns the ball over at the worst moment, and let’s his team fall apart around him.   Bud however is literally the worst crunch time adjustment coach in the NBA. PJ Tucker was contributing *nothing* on either side of the ball and played for 33 fucking minutes. 33 minutes, *zero fucking points*. Patty Con had more points and played tougher defensive minutes than Tucker did and he’s *Patty Con*. Bobby Portis didn’t play at all, at least he could have scored a couple buckets.   “PJ was out there for his defense and to get under KD skin.” Yeah it worked really well, KD had the third greatest playoff performance in NBA history. Shit I’m 6’4 and I think *I* could have played tougher D on KD.   Jrue Holiday hasn’t been lights out, but fuck he only played 30 minutes that whole game! Khris and Giannis each played 40+, the the fuck isn’t Jrue out there for 40+ if he’s supposed to be your 3rd option playmaker guy that’s an insanely good defender?   When the Bucks lose (and they’re gonna lose), it’ll be 80% Bud’s fault and he should be fired promptly. Even if by some fucking miracle we win game 6 and 7, beat the 76ers or Hawks, beat the Suns or whoever the fuck rolls out of the West unscathed and win the title… *still fucking fire Bud*."
" Giannis just didn’t grow up playing enough basketball and it shows. Some will say but what about Joel Embiid who also played basketball late? But Embiid consciously modeled his game after Hakeem. In this series there’s a visible skill and basketball difference between Giannis and others like  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. Giannis is truly a rim attacker, utilizing every bit of his physical gifts and strength. However he lacks that fluidity and handle to constantly create his own shot. He’s also not big enough ala prime Shaq to dominate a packed paint. So the shots defenses give him are the 3 point shot and 1 vs 1 mid range and those just aren’t his strengths. His free throws are atrocious too. I really hope Giannis can develop that outside stroke and dribbling. Lebron didn’t have much of a shot but he ended up doing shit like Lebronto.. hopefully Giannis can too"
Yes. 1000% coulda got Myles Turner and a buncha other stuff from Indiana for Jrue seeing as they already have the other 2 Holiday brothers and Myles’ value last offseason wasn’t all that high. It’s a shame what Griff turned this roster into and Pels fans fall for his speeches so they just blindly act as if we had no better options
Jrue Holiday said it's the first time he has had a coach in the NBA that really seems to genuinely care about his players.
"It's tough because on the other hand, Jrue Holiday cited Coach Bud specifically for his reason to sign the extension with the team. A lot of the players seem to really like Coach Bud."
"ok look, Griff has made a few very bad decisions. But judging his work at this stage would be a bit like judging Hinkie two years into the Process imo. They missed on a lot of draft picks, made some moves that didn't work out, and also traded Jrue Holiday.  I think this year was designed to be a growth year more than people realize. Also think our books aren't nearly as bad as ppl have made them out to be. The most important thing beyond Zion and BI is we have a few good developing guys and a lot of draft picks on the way. We're positioned to make aggressive moves right around when Zion should be ready to contend."
"Yeah the two egregiously bad decisions he's made so far are  1. Taking back Eric Bledsoe instead of George Hill in the Jrue Holiday trade. Zion plays almost the same style of ball that Giannis does, but Griffin didn't get the message that the Bucks were literally trying to dump Bledsoe because of how egregiously bad he was in the playoffs. I'm pretty convinced that they could've easily had HILL considering he was just redirected to OKC anyways. Hill's contract was much more manageable and he was a much better fit alongside Pelicans' core (spacing + decent defense) 2. Bringing in Steven Adams instead of Myles Turner. Myles Turner, while he is not as good at rebounding/boxing out, is a better rim protector and can actually space the floor on offense for Zion. One of the reasons the Bucks exploded was because they brought in Brook Lopez to clear out the floor for Giannis. Myles Turner was VERY AVAILABLE. The Celtics were exploring a market to redirect him and found that few teams valued him. The Pelicans coulda had him last offseason for super cheap  The team David Griffin is building around Zion, in spite of the fact that they have a shit ton of assets, is so bad that I'd be worried that Zion would take the qualifying offer just to gtfo  Pelicans need to fire him if they don't want Lebron 2.0 on their hands"
Let’s not forget about the Jrue Holiday trade. Just gave up one of the best two-way guards in the league right in his prime. Three late firsts is never gonna replace that.
"Based on their listed positions, you have Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, and Jrue Holiday contending for the two spots in a hypothetical 5th team. One of those players is going to be relegated to the 8th team All-NBA. The guard talent in the NBA is insane right now."
Of course his presence was important.  The Bucks had Jrue Holiday cover him down the stretch.  Lets say Mike James was out there.  Durant gets doubled.  The Bucks then dare Mike James (or Landry Shamet) to beat them.
Ben Simmons is the best perimeter defender in the league. Jrue holiday is also 6’3 he’s not doing anything to KD lmfao
"Durant was facing the DPOY, a great defender in Middleton, supposedly the best guard defender in Jrue Holiday and a solid paint protector Brook Lopez"
Bud probably legit thinking they did a great job defensively on Harden since he shot 1/10 even though they wasted Jrue Holiday guarding him and threw double teams.
Wasted by the organization lol. At some point people are gonna have to stop blaming the coaches and front office and look at the players. Giannis can't even dribble the ball or hit a free throw in crunch time. He can't create his own shot let alone a shot for someone else.  Everyone talks about jrue holiday being disappointing but they're asking him to do too much and be someone he's not bc they can't go to their best player when they need a bucket.
"That's one of the things I hate most about NBA coaches. I don't give a fuck if they are in foul trouble. Sure, you want to make sure they don't foil out and can be in in the last 2 minutes of a close game.  You know what's better than having Jrue Holiday guarding James Harden up 2 with 2 to play? Jrue Holiday being fouled out and being up 10 with 2 to play.  There is absolutely no way that sitting a star with 3 fouls improves your chance of winning. No way at all."

"Yes last night during the clutch jrue holiday was face guarding harden, he demands respect regardless"
You value defense more? Lol. Than Jrue Holiday is better than Kawhi. Lolololololll
"Jrue ain't here, he's on holiday."
Drag out Jrue Holiday and keep him from helping on defense also his playmaking.
"Dang, the turnaround on this sub haha. Weren't people sucking off Jrue Holiday last week? Something about how he plays the best defense in the universe?"
Could be talking about Jrue Holiday
seems that bud never had a vision for the team beyond putting shooters around giannis.  can someone find jrue holiday though? giannis and middleton badly need a point guard to get them easier looks but he’s nowhere while giannis is forcing these awful shots
Jrue  holiday signed a max contract lmao
Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are both over 30. This core isn’t getting any better.
Jrue Holiday might be one of the most overrated players in the NBA and he will continue to get a free pass. He's having a horrible series and he can't even take advantage of a one legged Harden.
Don’t even start on Jrue holiday. He played like his money was on the Nets.
"Long time Hornets/Pelicans fan here. Its gotta be the age kicking in man. Love me some Jrue but his defense early in his career lasted more than 8 quarters a week with no decline in performance. Now, you get 4 quarters a week with severely declining offense AND defense. All of this is compounded in a playoff series against the same opponent.  addition: Again, LOVE Jrue Holiday. Bless this dude"
What happened to Jrue Holiday he should of been going around Harden all game
"Agree, they shot their wad on .... Jrue Holiday? Definitely not a big enough upgrade and I honestly have no clue where they go from here."
Yeah he was a pressure release valve for KD and an extra ball handler. And for some inexplicable reasons the Bucks stuck Jrue Holiday on him most of the game when Pat Conaughton probably could have checked him
"I mean, if you told me that Bledsoe &amp; Jrue Holiday freaky friday'd for this series I'd believe you.  Jrue has been BRUTAL"
He’s still a great floor general and kept Jrue Holiday on him the whole game
"Why can’t you guys understand this. Yes, you’re right, he could barely shoot tonight. But the fact of the matter is that Jrue fucking Holiday was guarding him the entire time like he was the normal James Harden and this was huge for the Nets. Wouldn’t even matter if he had a broken arm, as long as Bud is getting Jrue to guard him like that, Harden needs to be out there."
He absolutely was getting doubled at times. Plus he basically took Jrue Holiday out of the game defensively.
"no, but it is Budenholzer letting Giannis, Middleton and Holiday all iso on loop for an entire half letting the Nets come back from down 20. it is Budenholzer deciding that after an entire timeout to draw up a play in a crucial part of the game, his genius play call is to run 1 incredibly predictable Giannis-Jrue pnr and when it obviously doesn’t work not having any backup plan except letting Holiday iso against KD. it is on Budenholzer to be absolutely allergic to making any sort of adjustments ever in any game that he basically has to completely rely 100% on his best players to just carry them through by making tough contested shots on isos. yes Giannis had a couple unclutch plays at the end, but those certainly aren’t the story of the game. truth is it should’ve never been close in the first place."
"That’s Khris* Middleton’s job, but for some reason they went to Jrue Holiday in the post against Harden, which is arguably  where he stands out the most defensively."
"It's insane how many people don't understand why giannis is a good defender. Giannis is good at playing help defense and protecting the rim. Giannis absolutely cannot guard KD. He is not quick enough laterally and he sucks trying to get around screens. Of course giannis isnt going to guard KD when there are at least 2 better options on the team in middleton and tucker. Even jrue holiday would be a debatably better choice.  Defense isn't so simple as your best defender guards their best player. You wouldn't have rudy gobert guard KD either, or kawhi for the series hes in, and hes the actual DPOY  I expect dumb ass takes like this from reddit analysts, but not from actual nba players"
"Nah it's bud, they should have switched onto harden every single second he was on the court, they didn't do that except for jrue holiday but I mean that has to be the gameplan. Bud seems like he can't think under pressure very well, almost no adjustments ever"
Took up the attention of Jrue Holiday defense.
damn they already drawing up jrue holiday mock trades 😭😭
Jrue Holiday is a much better player than CJ.
Jrue Holiday simply isn't a lead ball handler/playmaker and he's forced into this role because the Bucks don't have an actual playmaker.
"Not to mention taking Jrue Holiday out of the game on the defensive end. If harden isn’t there, who’s Jrue gonna take? Jeff Green ain’t scoring 26 if he was free to guard him."
On the last KD bucket Jeff Green and Harden were in the same corner doing nothing as KD boogied on Kris Middleton in iso with Jrue Holiday just watching and not doubling.  Wtf are we doing.
The two Jrue Holiday isos late in the fourth was when I knew it was over lmao
"That was honestly one of the worst coaching performances I’ve seen in a playoff game.   His defensive choices (dropping Brook, refusing to match up Giannis on KD, having Jrue check a hobbled harden) were abysmal, and that was absolutely brain dead offense. Just nonstop iso-ing but doing it when not even trying to exploit matchups. Like, you should not have Jrue Holiday iso on a locked-in Kevin fucking Durant when Harden can barely move out there."
Im one of the most critical people of his flaws and think they will always be big issues in a playoff series but this game was on Jrue holiday doing idek what with broken harden on him
How much help does Jrue Holiday need?
Giannis is getting a lot of hate but I don’t think this loss is on giannis. Giannis was super efficient this game the rest of the bucks were just bad starting with jrue holiday   Also bud doesn’t put him in good positions
Jrue Holiday is so tough man.
Jrue Holiday channeling his inner Eric Bledsoe
Giannis with Joe Harris on him and instead Jrue Holiday with a terrible iso shot over Durant. Bucks are fucked man.
Jrue holiday with the quietest 17 I’ve ever seen
Jrue Holiday is lost lol
There’s way too much jrue holiday isos right now
Jrue Holiday is lowkey a low IQ player on offense. It's easy to see why he couldn't make the playoffs with AD in most years.
Jrue Holiday is without a doubt the dumbest PG in the league. What a scrub.
Jrue Poo Holiday gone and taken vacation
How did Jrue Holiday trick people into thinking hes an all star
Jrue rly wants that holiday eh
Giannis playing 2 v 5 rn. Jrue holiday has been shitting the bed except for the shot at the end of game 3
jrue holiday is so bad
"Lol, let’s be honest. Brooklyn is getting away with a lot of contact on defense. Regardless, Milwaukee is a fucking joke. How do you even let the game get to this point. Jrue is actually ready for his holiday."
"Lmao. No he can’t. He teamed up with 2 other superstars &amp; was exposed for half this game until the refs were gifting him fouls. Adam silver would rather send KD, harden &amp; kyrie to the ECF than giannis, Middleton &amp; Jrue holiday."
Jrue Holiday choking hard
Jrue Holiday with your average r/NBA user shot there.
I guess Jrue Holiday wasn't the answer
every jrue holiday iso has gone poorly why does he keep trying to draw it out and 1 on 1? lol
Jrue 3 1sts and swaps Holiday
Jrue Holiday flies by Harden for an easy layup  Bud: Let’s not do that again
Jrue Holiday is not a good point guard lol
Jrue holiday dribbling for 20 seconds is epic offense.
"I understand completely but:  Jrue Holiday, Middleton and Giannis should be enough to overcome Jeff freaking Green having a good game."
Jrue Holiday is a god. No more to say but that. Jrue Holiday is a god.
Imagine letting Jrue Holiday score in 2021
skip to my jrue holiday then harden buys a basket
Bucks without Jrue Holiday lost to the Heat  Bucks with Jrue Holiday smoked the Heat  You can make the case that they overpaid but if they make the finals for the first time since 1974 will anyone really care?
Didn’t the bucks sell the farm for Jrue holiday lol
jrue holiday impact is mostly under-appreciated imo
damn jrue holiday gonna go off
Jrue is on holiday this series it seems
With stats out of the way lets actually do some comprehension  Is Joe 1/11 Harris better than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday?
"I think Chuck made a great point about Jrue, you can't let a guy who hasn't practiced in two weeks come in and show you up.    Harden is an all-time great offensive player but Holiday was picked up for a reason, and he has a reputation for being a great defensive guard.     This has to be his game. This is what he gets paid for."
Philly’s bench isn’t Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.  Also just so ya know I’m not reading the novels you’re writing right now lmao
"I’m sure conditions that were the exact same for both teams contributed more to our loss than you signing a top 25 player in basketball and us losing Jae Crowder. The mental gymnastics you’re doing to make The Bucks the victims here are Simon Bikes-like. I am happy with our finals run last year, and annoyed that we got worse as the Bucks got better, and are being called frauds because there was a different result when two completely different teams faced off (seriously. Everyone’s talked for years about how great and under appreciated Jrue Holiday is, and then the second the Bucks beat the Heat they acted like he doesn’t exist so they can push their “bubble frauds” narrative in order to reconcile with their team’s lack of postseason success last year)"
"Why you living in the bubble then?   &gt;4th seed  Hey look you’re wrong some more.   &gt;better this year with Jrue Holiday   You mean the 1st Team All Defense with Giannis, Jrue?"
No. It’s the very next season. In the second round of the playoffs. What were the Bucks this year the 4th seed? I thought they were supposed to be better this year with Jrue Holiday
"Dude really has nothing in his arsenal offensively in the half court. Can't score anything outside the restricted area.    When he posts up from the left he's always going for that runner hook shot with his right hand and when he posts up from the right he's doing the spin baseline drive, again with his right hand. His father fucked him by forcing him to shoot with his left for some reason as he's clearly a natural righty and in no way ambidextrous like i.e. Jrue Holiday."
They have 2 all Def players this season. Giannis finally guarded butler and we got jrue holiday. Bubble probably had something to do with it too but a lot of people were saying the bucks were gonna lose again
Because one has Joe Harris as their next best player and the other has Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday
"I'm expecting Jrue Holiday to step up offensively big time in the series, now he doesn't have to keep Kyrie/Harden on lock"
"Lowkey Vucevic on the Hornets would make them the 4/5 best team in the east along with Miami. Depending on what they give up of course. Given the precedent set by the Bucks and Jrue Holiday for FRPs, how many would Vucevic cost?"
"The problem is Jrue Holiday got such a massive haul that any team is gonna as, for at least something li,e that for players better than Jrue.  Bucks really screwed the market in that way."
"Jrue holiday got two picks and two pick swaps. Not four picks straight up. Part of that value was also getting off bledsoes contract.   I don't think you'll be getting 3 firsts for lowry. Maxey, PHI 2021 first and NYK 2021 second probably."
"You’d be stupid to take just a single first for Lowry.   Jrue Holiday went for four picks, and I’d argue he’s a worse player overall than Lowry. Accepting anything less than 2-3 future firsts for Lowry is just a bad trade for us."
"He is not Harden, we aren’t gonna get offered Simmons for him.  He isn’t even Jrue Holiday in terms of value. Lowry has half year on the deal and is 4 years older."
What makes Jrue Holiday on an expiring worth 4 FRP but Lowry isn’t that valuable? Lowry is the better player
Holiday was playing at an all star level before COVID and is 5 years younger. They essentially only traded one more pick and one more swap for Jrue when looking at what the Thunder got for Paul.
"Maybe I should make an entire post on this, but it just occurred to me that Jrue Holiday is a free agent after this year, and since the Bucks just gave up a huge haul for him, they pretty much have to give him whatever deal he wants."
A Jrue Holiday package of picks.
That 0/10 from 3 game against the Pels last season has to be up there (Jrue Holiday for DPOY)
"The Warriors are just bad luck for the TWolves come draft time.   1989: Wolves select Point Guard Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick. This allows Golden State to select another Point Guard by the name of TIM HARDAWAY. Shawn Kemp and Vlade Divac were also available.   2009: Wolves use two First Round picks on Point Guards: Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. Unfortunately, this paves the way for Golden State to pick up a PG of their own: STEPHEN CURRY. DeMar DeRozan and Jrue Holiday were also ripe for the taking.   2011: Timberwolves draft Derrick Williams at 2nd overall. A total bust. Not like the guy that went to Golden State at Pick Number 11: KLAY THOMPSON. They also missed out on Kemba Walker and Kawhi Leonard. Woof."
"Thats definitely fair. There's also things like NBA experience vs Age experience, etc that would prevent it from being perfect.       This range technically does catch Randle in his year with NOP where he would be third fiddle to Anthony Davis/Jrue Holiday. Definitely not exactly the same, but could help balance the comparison"
Covid is legit and players will struggle when they comeback you have to give them time jrue holiday Seth curry and tatum have all look not as good since covid
"Curry, Ball, Holiday, Morris, and Lopez brothers would make a pretty dope team.  Steph/Jrue/Zo/Marcus/Brook  Melo/Seth/Justin/Markief/Robin  This could be a top 3 seed in the east"
"Come on now Jrue holiday had no chance as a guard getting into the all-star game in the west Curry,Westbrook, Lillard,Chris Paul,James Harden,Klay,Kobe Bryant, ect. Plus he missed a year dealing with his wife."
"Compare the stats to the Miami big three. I'm not saying Jrue holiday is Dwayne wade but statistically, they give you the same thing. I'm not saying kris Middleton is Chrish bosh but statistically he giving you the same thing."
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday can’t play this poor come playoffs.
Jrue Holiday playing worse than DJ Augustin isn’t ideal
"The sad part is Jrue Holiday is a good enough playmaker to be capable of pairing well with Giannis but the Bucks' offense is still ""Giannis drive to basket"" even though it could be so much more"
"Ben Simmons, Dort, Giannis, Myles Turner, Gobert  Jrue Holiday, Royce O'Neale &amp; OG Anunoby should be on the 2nd team"
Jrue and Justin Holiday reunion with Lonzo
"Jrue Holiday. I miss you 🥺  Favorite player that has never played for my team, maybe Butler."
"Here's an *amazing* hypothetical trade - Khris Middleton for Kyle Lowry straight up.  As a Raptors fan, I would love this trade. We would get to see the start of our 'rebuild' by trading our aging top-10 point guard for a great piece to build for the future in Khris Middlleton. Khris Middleton can be kept if the Raptors want to stay middle of the pack in the East. Steady Freddie would take the rain as the de facto playmaker of the raptors - a role he's ready for. The team would lose a bit of playmaking, ballhandling and leadership from Kyle Lowry, but Khris Middleton would give us better shooting and Middleton isn't a bad playmaker himself. Raptors could trade Middleton too for 2 or 3 first round picks if they wanna rebuild harder.  Milwaukee fans: wouldn't you like this trade? You would get first an amazing presence for the team's culture. Kyle has shown he can work great with coaches to develop an amazing culture; with Kyle and Mike's brains working together, the Bucks could come up with some super high-IQ offensive schemes. Next you would get improved playmaking and ballhandling from Lowry. Him and Holiday would be an unreal guard duo. Lowry knows how to use his body extremely well so there would be little loss on defence despite his deceptive 6 ' 0 frame. And last but not least, Lowry will give you an efficient 18 a night - only a 2 point loss from Middleton.  Their salaries match pretty evenly - maybe Milwuakee would have to throw in salary filler - but other than that the trade would work pretty evenly. As a Raptors fan I am sad to see Lowry go - he was an amazing leader not only for the Raptors but in everything he does. Lowry will always be an icon in Canada. This represents a win-now move for the Milwuakee Bucks. With the offensive versatility, culture, and defence that this team will have led by the Big 3 of Giannis, Kyle Lowry, and Jrue Holiday, this team will be enough to beat any other team in the East. I would bet that Big 3 and the Bucks depth to win over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and their depth. I would easily see this team beating the 76ers.   Let me know what you all think!"
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Bruh, I'm not gonna be making any cases for LeBron this year, especially since I got my own dog in this fight, but Jesus Christ, are you seriously putting Jrue Holiday and goddamn Anthony Davis in the same sentence here?  Like I'm trying to come up with a comparison to put it into perspective how hilariously dumb this take is, but I legit can't."
Harden has gotten to play with a never ending rotation of other superstars. The best players Giannis has gotten to play with in his prime are Middleton and now half a season of Jrue Holiday.
"“Jrue Holiday, Norman Powell and Jaylen Brown are overrated”"
His name is Jrue holiday
"Jrue Holiday... constantly one of the most underrated players in the league. Eric Gordon who just mailed it in in NOLA and suddenly became integral for the Rockets. Rajón Rondo in the playoffs. Boogie Cousins before his achilles robbed him. Nikola Mirotic who was solid. The big misses were Omer Asik's disease, Solomon Hill &amp; Etwaun Moore overpays. Stop acting like because we ain't have a top 2 all time player to pair with him that we had horrible roster construction. Boogie doesn't get hurt and the Pels are a force for the next 5 years.   Oh well. Seeing how him and Toni forced their way out, I'm happy with the core we have now. Top 15 3&amp;D guard and solid backup big away from having a force. With the assets to move whenever that guard becomes available and BI / Zion / Zo start hitting their peak."
People underrate Jrue Holiday a ton. He was a great running mate for AD and they formed one of the best two way duos in the league  Sucks him and the rest of the players the Pels got struggled with injuries
"His handle and finishing are by far his two worst parts of his game. He's good at literally everything else and his FT shooting has become solid now. If he can work on his handle and especially finishing, he'll be a very complete player with All-Star potential. He'll likely never be a superstar or perennial All-Star but I can see him becoming a Jrue Holiday level guy."
"Yea but his second best player was Jrue Holiday (no disrespect dude can ball), but to have Ingram backing you up is a different story. Plus NOLA ain’t even sniffing the playoffs rn so it’s not reflecting well on Zion’s case. Freak athlete? Yes. Future HOFer? Most likely. Superstar? Not yet."
Bledsoe is Marcus Smart being given Jrue Holiday responsibilities
we havent had a good combo guard since jrue holiday 9 years ago.  Shake is the closest thing to it and hes not out of the oven yet
The Celtics' struggles underline just how important Smart is. Boston is going to have to learn how to play without their longest tenured player just like the Pelicans have been learning how to play without Jrue Holiday.
"To offer a somewhat serious reply - it's difficult to judge the recent picks too much. For one, 2nd round picks rarely ever pan out, and so there's no surprise guys like Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters aren't anything noteworthy (shoutout to Semi Ojeleye though, who's actually a contributor). And even first-rounders don't carry a high guarantee of success.  As for his first-round picks, Romeo Langford has been injured more than not, and that's never a good sign for any player's potential. But when he did play, it did look like he belonged in the league. Time will tell what becomes of him once he returns.  Speaking of time, Rob Williams is a pretty underrated prospect. Yeah he's already in his 3rd year and is 23, but he was always a project to begin with, and this year he's definitely shown a lot of improvement with his defense. His minutes aren't very high, but that's supposedly so his hip problem doesn't flare up too soon into the season. If he can put everything he has together, he'd definitely be outplaying his #27 draft selection.  Grant Williams is okay, it's hard to see him getting a 2nd contract at this point, but he looked better last year, so there's hope he can revert (his 3P% is up at least).  It's way too early to tell with Nesmith, but he's definitely not a James Young kind of player. His career will rely on being able to knock down 3s consistently.  As for Ainge getting better results from these draft picks - one could certainly argue for that. What was once a treasure trove of picks has now resulted in a lot of uncertainty. It didn't help that both the Kings and Grizzlies played above expectations (they were seen as surefire top 7 picks prior). But in order for him to sell those picks, there had to be buyers - and not a lot of buyers want late lottery/mid-20s picks and nothing else. Ainge was definitely targeting someone like Jrue Holiday, but the Bucks' offer was simply too much for him to match.  I do think it's unfortunate so many players left the C's without compensation, such as Horford, Irving, and Morris. Rozier and Hayward as well, sort of, though we'll see how that TPE and Kemba's knee turn out. I just think his draft assets - combined with the success of Tatum/Brown -  got way overhyped."
"I hate saying things like this because they’re so annoying to hear but I would’ve tried to package the picks and make a play at a guys like Myles Turner, DeMar Derozan, Steven Adams, Bogdan Bogdonvic, Jrue Holiday, Harrison Barnes. Or if I was really confident in my draft skills I wouldve made more of an effort to move up in the draft in either 2019 or 2020"
"This. What made Milwaukee so good the last 2 years was that their 2nd unit was much better than other 2nd units. Last year, George hill, divencenzo, Marvin Williams, and Robin Lopez was a really really good 2nd unit. And that doesn’t include Pat Connaughton, Kyle Korver, or Ersan. But none of that matters in playoffs. Cause your depth guys aren’t playing against other team 2s anymore. And you shouldn’t be going 10 deep in playoffs (bucks did). Part of the bucks current “struggles” is that their 2nd unit now sucks at defense. DD is a starter, Williams retired and Lopez and hill both on new teams. DJ Augustine, Bobby Portis, and Forbes are just not good defenders. While Holiday And DD are only slightly better D combo than Bledsoe and Matthew’s (much stronger O combo though). I’m still optimistic for bucks being better in playoffs if Bud commits to playing Jrue-Khris-Giannis as much as possible while Augustine, portis, and Forbes just fill in for points off bench."
I hope you were joking. Jrue holiday is 100% better than lowry (lowry might be a better leader).
why not?  I mean jrue holiday netted new orleans a ransom and we should be doing the same seeing as almost 35 year old lowry can still ball.  and the sixers' championship window is not really that wide open considering it'll always hinge on embiid being healthy.  no better time than the present with the east as uncertain as it's been in a few years.
Jrue Holiday (no bias)
Eric Bledsoe is like Jrue Holiday if Jrue Holiday fucking sucked
"Even if Kawhi was going to leave the year after in FA, then getting a haul of picks and a young player(s) would have been the better choice. Think about this. You got Demar (Older, poor spacing, team ratings are worse with him in), Jakob and a late first rounder and you  actually threw in a good player as well in Danny Green. You could have negotiated atleast another first rounder, a young player who would now be an all star, etc. I mean Kawhi a top 5 player in the league and Porzingis, Jrue Holiday, Harden, AD, Tobias, etc all got more assets lol"
"If that is the case, then getting a haul of picks and a young player would have been the better choice. Think about this. You got Demar Jakob and a late first rounder and actually threw in a good player as well in Danny Green. You could have negotiated atleast another first rounder, a young player who would now be an all star, etc. I mean Kawhi a top 5 player in the league and Porzingis, Jrue Holiday, Harden, AD, Tobias, etc all got more assets lol"
jrue holiday and mike conley only because they won teammate of the year lol
"Jrue Holiday made it in 2012-13, then no one until Embiid made it in 2017-18"
"It’s interesting that other than on/off and team record, Conley has near identical stats to Jrue Holiday with worse defense. Could it be that Conley isn’t as good as the stats make him seem?"
"If we’re doing current players, then why not include Jrue Holiday, Trae Young,  etc...?"
Jrue Holiday Danny Granger Andre Iguodala Zion Williamson Kristaps Porzings
Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday?
"Mitch and Noel are actually pretty ideal as far as being rim protecting bigs who can slip screens and (less so in Noel's case) get their hands around the ball so long as it's in their general area. A Jrue Holiday-type PG is probably the biggest need, someone who can play on and off ball, limit the amount of energy he needs to expend on D, and swap slightly between 1st and 2nd option depending on the matchup."
"Dort is still pretty elite off ball but I guess people really only look at that with reflections and steals. His positioning and IQ is absurd.   Ben shouldn’t be top 5 on off ball either. Jrue Holiday is CERTAINLY top 5 on ball as well.   Also, shouldn’t Gobert be here on off ball? Just naturally as the best rim protector? That’s technically rotations and recovery as well right?  Edit: nvm the Gobert stuff. Saw your explanation for bigs."
Jrue Holiday would like to have a word for on ball...
On ball  OG Dort Marcus Smart Aaron Gordon Jrue Holiday  Off Ball  Giannis Davis Gobert Embiid Jonathon Isaac
It's funny because slow and unathletic are not the Bucks problems. Jrue holiday being out for 6 games and lack of depth are the Bucks problems lol Hopefully that shouldn't matter come playoff time.
Jrue Holiday?
"Personally I’d like to see the Bucks win it all.  I like Jrue Holiday and would like to a player like Giannis win it all in a small market, rather than building a super team in a prime location.  Also anyone but the Nets"
"Again, Tatum and brown are only 22 and 24. U should absolutely expect them to continue to get better, players rarely peak that young. And as we've seen good players are available all the time so they shouldn't jump the gun when they still have time. Like the bucks sold the farm for jrue holiday, that might make sense for a team on the verge of losing their star player who is really in the middle of his prime, but it doesn't make sense for the Celtics. Lastly, it's not true that they don't exercise their assets, they made a great trade for kyrie Irving with one Nets pick and essentially used the other two to draft Tatum and brown."
"Just take just some sorta risk, they should’ve been in the butler or Jrue holiday sweepstakes. Just some sorta gamble, I’m sure they could’ve beat out the Nets package for harden or maybe the raptors package for Kawhi. I think their best shot at a chip was in 2018, I think their gonna start declining."
Jrue holiday missed games and bucks lost like 5 in a row or something and they got the reigning 2x mvp. You wanna know why? Look who the fuck was replacing jrue holiday who isn't even considered a top 25 player. Similar situation to the lakers except Schroeder and AD have been out
Ben Simmons  Jrue Holiday   Marcus Smart  Khris Dunn
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
"Its pretty shitty timing with your recent skid but yeah obviously you would be heavily favoured in that series, but the matchup actually isn't ideal for you.  Our weakness is true centers that can take advantage of our lack of size inside. That's why we struggled against the Wolves of all teams, we just have nobody who can physically match up with KAT. Giannis on the other hand is someone that Siakam or OG could reasonably check, and Brook Lopez is completely unplayable in that series as he wouldn't be able to guard Siakam Anunoby or Boucher, and he's just not the offensive player he used to be where he would burn us on the other end (Boucher was able to block his shot several times when we played). Middleton has also struggled against the Raptors historically, and Jrue Holiday won't have slow footed defenders to attack in the pick and roll, as he's going to see Anunoby Siakam or Boucher on the 1/5 pick and roll.  Again, on paper you *should* still win, but that was true about your last two playoff outings so we will see. I think I'd be more confident in the Bucks once I see how they bounce back from this recent skid"
"Imagine you're the GM of the Bucks or 76ers.  Holiday and Lowry cost the same package in assets.  You're worried about re-signing both of them in the offseason.  You can have a 31 year old Jrue Holiday who has played 67 and 61 games the last two seasons for 33M X 3 years + player option.   or   You can have a 35 yr old Kyle Lowry 58 and 65 games who wants 20M X 3 years + a Team Option  Which would your rather have?  Lowry is likely to decline faster, but he's also going to be cheaper and it will probably be a team option in the last year.  Younger guys cost more.  Jrue will be more expensive and he's not as good as Lowry but he will probably decline slower.   Second question, if both signed 3 year deals, which one do you expect to play more games over the course of three years?"
"Those guys are mentioned all the time on NBA radio and all the podcasts.  Everyone knows they’re good, otherwise the Bucks wouldn’t have traded so much for Jrue and been praised for it, while everyone thought Utah would be awesome last year since Conley was going there.   Holiday was talked up so much he had me wondering why he didn’t win several rings with AD lol"
"Something tells me that Masai and Lowry have already had discussions about this, and if Lowry really wanted out, he would have been traded by now. Think Griffin and Jrue Holiday."
It makes sense for Philadelphia to target the hometown guy in Lowry. It makes no sense for the Raptors to trade him without a Jrue Holiday level return.
Jrue Holiday is a free agent after the season
Still way less than what bucks paid for an expiring jrue holiday
"Jimmy Butler, Vucevic, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley. All bad men. All players who rarely get the recognition they deserve."
If Jrue doesn’t want to remain in Milwaukee a Holiday/Kemba sign and trade might be good for both teams
"Lol, you guys talk up jrue holiday like he’s Scottie fucking pippen at pg. when this is all over we’ll all have a good laugh at the excessive Jrue hype (ftr I been a long time jrue fan, not even hating)"
"The Raptors have the ""hope Jrue Holiday isn't playing"" strategy down pat"
They might want the Milwaukee package given up for Jrue Holiday for Vuc. I probably wouldn’t do that if Milwaukee I would give up a couple top 5 protected firsts though
"The trade value of Vuc should be on par with Jrue Holiday; so basically a floor of 3 late FRPs. I don’t know why BOS doesn’t give that offer now with their huge TPE that will expire worthless in 3 weeks. Fournier I think is worth 1 decent FRP as an expiring. You’d have to feel out his wishes so far as, will he re-sign with the new team. I look at the Magic’s roster and don’t share the optimism of some of their fans on this sub. Very little shooting. No stars. Players with health issues (as a long-time Fultz bag-holder, he’s got “will never reach his potential” written all over him). I’m not sure what OKC’s grand plan is, likewise NO’s. They’re kind of shadow operators because of Presti or Griffen think next season is one in which they want to actually compete, they could be buyer’s for Vuc or Fournier as well. And they both have all the picks in the world to trade. So it’ll be interesting how the market develops but I have no idea why they don’t blow it up. The Nets, Celtics, Sixers and Raptors aren’t going anywhere. MIA and IND are lurking. That’s the top 6. All look to be solid for the next four years. CHA is better than ORL even when healthy. Seven. So you’re competing with CHI, ATL and NYK for the 8th seed...and I’d pick your roster last of those four. To me that’s blow it up territory."
"Simmons, Smart  Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown (categorized as guard in All Star)  and my homer pick, Matisse Thybulle. Throw in Beverly, Gary Trent Jr., Paul George, Gary Harris, etc.  I’m not saying all of these guys are better than Vanvleet, I’m just saying he’s not one of the top 4."
How do you feel about a sign and trade for Jrue Holiday?
"Sign and trade for Jrue Holiday, calling it now"
"What’s the difference? Jrue Holiday, Mirotic, Rondo and Boogie for part of the season wasn’t enough help? Honestly, Giannis’ supporting cast has not been that great. He makes a top 40 guy look top 20 in Middleton. That’s also something AD couldn’t do."
Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday got traded for 4 first and he's worse than Simmons and like 6 years older.
"Let’s go through a list of some notable players who refer to Jrue Holiday as one of the game’s best three defenders or as the league’s most underrated players:   [Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams, Joe Ingles, JJ Redick.](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2020/9/9/21428836/jrue-holiday-giannis-lebron-james-ja-morant-all-defensive-pelicans-bucks-clippers-beverley-bledsoe)"
"Surely you aren't leaving off Jrue Holiday, Brogdon, LaMelo, Murray, Wall, Clarkson but putting westbrook here right?"
"There’s also how well Tatum has performed in the playoffs. He’s excelled when it matter most, and when defenses are totally locked in and specifically game planned for him.   I know Lavine has been on bad teams, not trying to get into the argument of whether he contributed or elevated them. But Lavine has struggled against locked in elite defenders the types he’d face in the playoffs. The New Year’s Day game this season against the bucks, jrue holiday really took it to him on the defensive end. And I’ve seen Ben Simmons and Thybulle really lock him up as well as the Boston defense. Don’t get me wrong Lavine is a very very talented offensive player. Even in game against sixers other night Thybulle kept him from really going off but Lavine still scored 30, he was 9 of 28 from the field.   Tatum has missed time and all in this weird season and this particular season itd be hard to argue Lavine has played better so far. But his playoff performances hold way more weight for me."
"Bledsoe was supposed to be Jrue Holiday lite but has just not figured out how to assert himself. The bench is crazy bad. The offense keeps evolving from the trash they put out opening night but is still a work in progress, and teams just don't fear our closeouts coz 4 of the 5 guys off our bench are 6'4"" or under."
"It’s true. We literally tried to rebuild after the Bynum trade blew up, and we got so much shit for it. We embraced sucking for draft picks because it was the only way to get good in a city with dubious attractiveness to high caliber free agents.   The NBA doesn’t incentivize being mediocre. You’re either a contender or wasting your fans’ time. Thad Young, Lou Williams, Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, and Jrue Holiday weren’t going to win a championship or be bad enough to get them into position to win one. Gotta draft talent, get good and hope they stick around."
"I said potentially my guy.  Also, Harden is the best of them all so that maybe factors into the equation as well.  Aslo, the Pels got Bledsoe, Adam's, 2 firsts, and two swaps for Jrue Holiday.   We got fleeced."
Nerlens Noel and what eventually became Dario Saric for Jrue Holiday was a great move. Getting rid of Asik's contract for Nikola Mirotic was another one. Pels made a lot of dumb ass decisions but they've been snake bitten too.
I think a good chunk of it is just bad opponent shooting luck. That should straighten itself out a bit. Losing Jrue Holiday for two weeks exacerbates that problem because they've been playing DJ Augustin more and he's literally one of the worst defensive players I've ever watched. He's the type of dude that can singlehandedly tank your defence.
"No he didn't destroy Lillard, Jrue Holiday did. Thats just re-writing history, AD being mobile obviously helped but anyone watching that series with a brain knew that Jrue Holiday was 90% responsible for putting the clamps on Dame"
"Dame was also leading bad and injury riddled rosters to the playoffs in 6 of their first 7 years while AD missed the playoffs in 5 of those 7. If you're gonna look at that one 4 game series where Jrue Holiday was actually the one that neutralized Dame, you gotta also point out how Dame took a team that was seen as a bottom of the conference roster after losing 4 of their 5 starters in FA to a 5 seed and 2nd round berth.  Bad injury luck and roster is no excuse when the debate is AD vs Dame, Dame is willing injury riddled squads and squads with perceived lack of talent into the playoffs year in and year out while AD was missing the playoffs almost every year of his career."
"Not really lol they’d have traded away some of there guards for more inside help and still had dwight/javale.  What do you mean when he has a “guard”, you mean when he has lebron, literally the greatest player ever? Because he had Jrue holiday and didn’t do shit.  What do you mean the nets will never be a real contender, they’re second in the East and will easily make the finals. I don’t care about kyrie but harden **is** as impactful as the numbers suggest, and actually even more. Have you even been watching him play?"
"Or because the Clippers were significantly better? The best PG's on defense are clearly Simmons Smart and Holiday, but the Pelicans weren't good enough for Jrue to be considered, so the next batch of high level defensive PG's (the Lowry's Bledsoe's and Beverley's) of the league got the votes even if they weren't as good as Jrue, he's on the Bucks now he'll probably get his respect."
I haven’t personally looked up all the exact stats but I’ve heard enough people that care to do it claim this and have seen examples of it myself.   For the most recent example just look at the bucks this year. It was so genius last year to let teams bomb 3s and protect the rim at s legendary rate and now this year they’re getting absolutely squashed by that style.   They add Jrue Holiday and now they’re perimeter defense/ability to defend the “right” perimeter player is....way worse? Unlikely.   The truth of it is last year opponents shot league average on 3s against them even though the bucks made it a point to let them shoot while this year opponents are shooting 43% on these easy shots being given to them.   Last year they got lucky and this year they’ve gotten probably slightly unlucky but the numbers make more sense in relation to their scheme.
"Yeah, sure, but apart from that...  Honestly think they'd be in Playoff contention right now if they'd just kept the same team from last year. Jrue Holiday is such a glaring omission and, don't get me wrong, I LOVE Steven Adams as a player and a dude but his fit on this team is just weird."
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
"i love shake but im just saying hes probably the best combo guard we have had since Jrue Holiday 9 years ago.  It is between him and Ish Smith, we just dont get guys that do normal guard things so its a big relief that we have shake."
"Got drafted by the Pels on 2k. Also, my pro mode player was Jrue Holiday (He was in 76ers then). Once, I started understanding the game, CP3 was my best player (I was just moving from soccer, where Paul Scholes was my favourite player. So CP3 kinda replaced Scholes for me).  Once I got serious about the NBA, I saw Jrue moved to NOLA, and CP3 was formerly there. I just gravitated towards the team."
"Defensive coach with no chance to have practices due to nature of season with games every other day. Lack of prep through film too. A bunch of guys who just all want to get their offensive stats and be all stars. They don’t have a smaller guard like jrue holiday was who can defend other lead guards like dame lillard and cp3. Lonzo is good but gets destroyed when screened through pick and roll and pels defensive rotations are horrible. Bledsoe is not even starting caliber as a guard tbh. They don’t trust each other, they allow the most 3 pointers in the league, and they are the worst defense bc they lack effort and a solid rim protector. Steve adams does not cut it. Zion and Bi are both offensive talents but if you watch them they do not put any effort on defense in order to help carry the team on offense. These are not winning habits or winning players. I’m a lonzo fan, not a pels fan. I want to see lonzo join a winning team with good defense where he can flourish. He plays the right way and is a player that makes winning plays."
"That team didn't have Jrue Holiday tbf  And the heat don't Have Crowder anymore   If I know bud from his time with the hawks, I think hes actually striving to be able to play the heat in the first round"
JRUE HOLIDAY!!!😤

So was that a Jrue Holiday or Donte Divincenzo assist? Lol
"Including New Orleans Hornets as well  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Jrue Holiday  SF: Brandon ingram  PF: Zion  C: AD  6th Man: Boogie  Others:   David West, Baron Davis, Peja Stojakovic, Jamal Mashburn, Tyson Chandler, and idk, maybe David Wesley?"
Jrue Holiday.
"Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, Donovan Mitchell, Brogdon off the top of my head."
I know you’re joking but I bet they give it to Jrue Holiday this season
"Yea the Pels worked with Jrue Holiday, who asked for a trade, and was moved to a contender. They took care of him. The thing about trades is it takes 2 to make a trade. No one wanted JJ where he wanted to go."
Maybe Jrue holiday will win it?
I remember him saying that he went to NOP in the first place because of Jrue Holiday.
People saying Jrue Holiday clamped him but gave 38 next game
Jrue Holiday is ∞-0 for DPOY in my book
Of the Holiday brother Jrue is definitely the MVP.
"Gonna go out on a limb, but I don’t think the Jrue Holiday trade worked out either..."
The Jrue Holiday invitational
There is a way to do it. Jrue Holiday seems to have his number
"We're getting to a trash point of defense in the NBA where mfqrz think just cuz they try hard they DPOY. Theres no evidence Jrue Holiday is anything other than an above average defender who tries hard but he's not disruptive to offenses in a way that he has to be planned around.    No one's afraid of Jrue Holiday, they just know its gonna be annoying to play against him."
Just rename it to the Jrue Holiday award and give it to the best defender who isnt him  Jrue gets to feel hes the best and the rest of the players get a chance to win it
"It’s not like he’s not an all star? Plus he’s getting paid at a super max. Obviously the Jazz could not afford to lose him. And rn, the Jazz are doing great bcuz bogdanovic has been on an absolute rampage.   I have guys like Jrue holiday/Mikal bridges/ Tobias Harris/ demar Derozan as much more underrated."
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
I’ll do this era  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: AI  SF: Danny Green  PF: John Collins  C: Myles Turner  I tried to make it semi-realistic but I don’t know how realistic it would be. I tried putting 3 good defenders around (and John Collins isn’t terrible) as well as having good spacing so AI can have open lanes. Collins is also a great lob threat for him
Jrue Holiday (for perimeter defense) - prime AI (scoring + hustle) - late Lebron (dominant ball-handler along with AI) - KD (before last injury -&gt; great defense) - Rudy Gobert/Ben Wallace (or another great rim protector..maybe Mutombo..that way this team will be closer to reality=)
"My own answer was the 2018 Rockets but swap out CP3 for Jrue Holiday, and AI for Harden. A buncha 3&amp;D wings w/ an elite rim protector under MDA.  edit: so  Jrue  AI  Tucker  Ariza  Capela  w/ the same bench of EG, Gerald Green, Moute, and Ryan Anderson."
"The 2018 Rockets but swap out CP3 for Jrue Holiday, and Harden for AI. It'd be a worse version obv but I think that's the ideal situation, a buncha 3&amp;D players, elite rim protector, all under MDA."
"I'm German and I played NBA Jam as a kid on my friends sega mega drive. He liked the Bulls, but we also often played the Sonics, because they had Schrempf, the only popular German in the NBA back then.  (Or did we play against each other and I was the Sonics? - i don't really remember..) As it was his game, he got to play Schrempf, so I was the reignman, of whom I thought, he was called the ""rainman"" back then (sidenote: another friend of mine explained to me, that that was his name, because of the angels crying when he dunks). So it was the Sonics and Shawn Kemp for me. Then I lost interest somewhere along the way (I believe it stopped being on TV in Germany after Jordan retired for good), but before that I had watched all those playoff games and the Jazz vs Bulls finals as they were on TV when I came from school.  Then I got back to the NBA some years ago. There was no Kemp and no Sonics anymore, but I had heard and seen some plays of this other freakish power forward named Anthony Davis. I also played 2k (career mode) that year as a PG and when the Sixers didn't want me, because I was too greedy, I needed a team with good bigs and the Pelicans picked me up. They had a really great team that year and that freak power forward I already knew and a good center too (Cousins). But in reality I especially came to like Holiday (and playoff Rondo). He is just a pleasure to watch and he was always showing effort, which, to my surprise, seemed to be pretty unique in the league. Rondo and AD were soon gone, but Jrue was still there and became my absolute favorite.  Now he is gone too and with the new players the dynamics of our sub somehow have changed. I often find myself annoyed by all the drama and the overall tone, but we somehow again have a great (and a lot more exciting) power forward, that is also a really likeable dude and also some young guys I like (especially Hayes, Kira) and we have some really likeable grinding guys in Hart and Adams. So I'm staying, but I'm also miserable most of the timebecause of it and sparsely feed on hopes of the brighter future. Guess I've become a true fan, lol. But the team somehow still is more fun then it has ever been during my time (except for maybe the season when we got Mirotic and played the Blazers and Warriors in the playoffs).  Another big reason is that the everyday hustlin pelican video is just objectively one of the best things on the internet.  &amp;#x200B;  tldr: (schrempf), KEMP, ad, JRUE, Zion and the future"
"Great point, not enough people recognize the necessary moves that small market teams need to make to attract talent. Tbh I wasn’t a huge fan of the Jrue Holiday trade at first but when you acknowledge the fact the Milwaukee simply won’t attract the same free agents that LA or Brooklyn will, it becomes much easier to understand and actually see as a solid move."
"Well, first of all he signed with New Orleans because of Jrue Holiday. Jrue had apparently recruited him to go to New Orleans with the hopes of really competing for a playoff spot. Then Zion got hurt that first year and it just kinda fell apart in the bubble. Then they traded Jrue. So that was one problem. Then with the covid restrictions and playing in New Orleans, he could hardly ever see his family which is understandably hard. He just wanted to go to a team closer to his family in New York."
Players like Coach Bud but his late game decisions are often questionable... Come playoff time Jrue Holiday will be crucial and I am all for that. He’s been amazing locking down the other teams’ best guards beside KPJ lol
The biggest reason Harden gets so many steals is [because of how often defenses attack him and go after him](https://go.nba.com/zjuq). Being that high on the list when you are Jrue holiday always guarding the best player 1-3 or 1-4 every night is one thing....that’s not what is happening here. Puts him in position where even if you get beat a lot you’ll end up also getting steals  People have overcorrected on the harden defense thing. He’s a slight negative when engaged and can be a lot worse when not. He still gambles and yes switching is important and a big reason you switch with him is he can’t get over screens or move his feet. But the biggest reason he’ll never be more than what he is defensively is in transition. As an ex here is the opponents on/off differential in terms of points/play in transition the past 3 years   2021: +9.2 points/transition play   2020: +13.2  2019: +18.1  Even if transition is only 15% of plays consistently being this bad where it makes it hard for your team to have a good transition defense when you are on the court will bring down your value considerably
"&gt;We pretending Klay/Dray didn't exist? A team of 4 all-nba players in their prime is unprecedented. Three max contracts on the same team, plus a DPOY-level anchor.  Sorry if I worded it wrong. What I meant was that Curry was the top engine behind what made them a superteam. Him and KD were unequivocally the top 2 players on that team, and were the main drivers of that success. It's different if Steph was the #3 on that team because it'd be fair to wonder if he really was that good without a superteam. But it's hard to discredit Steph considering his status on that team.  &gt;Out of \~1000 GSW playoff minutes, only 260 had an opposing starting PG. And yes, I'm counting Jrue and Conley's minutes in full even though they were notably injured. Then you have other starters out, such as Montiejunas and Kevin Love in full.  Fair point. But look at the context of that too. The Pelicans whether Jrue played or not weren't 2015 Jrue Holiday away from avoiding a sweep. So were the Rockets. They're not a Patrick Beverley away from a gentleman's sweep. Conley and the Cavs were really the only instances of injuries actually making a possibly decisively different result. And the Grizzlies were more so undone by playoff adjustments.  &gt;Not to mention the biggest threat in the West had injures to both superstars to barely miss the playoffs. Show me another year that even comes close.  It's not like they got healthy the next year and lost.  &gt;Sure. Except that I keep hearing about KD's rings not counting while Steph's do. That Kobe was carried by Shaq due to FMVPs, but Curry made things easy for Durant's FMVPs.  Considering that this thread only has me and you on it, it's unfair on my end if you keep bringing up other people's opinions on the matter because I'm not those other people.  &gt;You're using SRS to discredit Lakers being a 4-seed early in the season, so I'm saying the Warriors should be higher due to easy SRS after allstar break. Keep the same energy.  And the Lakers ended with a 37-45 record. The result wouldn't have been that bad if they weren't so shafted with injuries, but that's also a hypothetical on how good they would have been if they all played healthy. The Warriors ARE a better team once the schedule turned. They were 4 games below .500 at one point and are 3 games above .500 now. They went from like 22-27 to 36-33. You don't think the schedule had anything to do with that? I'm keeping the same energy man, unless you expected the Dubs to be a top tier team in the West. My preseason predictions had them as a 6-8 seed and it's averaging out now.  &gt;The entire discussion around 2019 Lakers vs. 2021 Warriors is a clusterfuck.  YOU started this. My original comment was:  &gt;And everyone would agree Bron and Curry makes their teams a lot better. Lakers without Bron in 2019 or Warriors without Curry in 2021 are bottom feeders rather than playoff/fringe playoff teams.  These are facts. These teams without their superstars would be shit. That's all I was trying to say. And yet you replied with:  &gt;LeBron's core was baby Ingram/Lonzo/Kuzma while Curry's is Draymond/Wiggins/Oubre. Curry has the better core who are all healthier, yet his team is an 8th seed.  Where the fuck in my comment did I ever start the comparison of the two other than they both elevate their teams, which is a fact btw? You're the one that started comparing those two even though they're completely different contexts outside the fact that they have 2 superstars who did/are doing their best to get them to the playoffs.  &gt;They're not similar situations and you're trying to pigeonhole the discussion as a told-you-so on LeBron's biggest disappointment since 2011 finals.  YOU'RE the one who brought it up, not me. And since there's no way to accurately compare them since they're so different, I even mentioned that:  &gt;but that's a moot point either way.  As in comparing them is moot other than saying that Steph and Bron elevated these really bad teams to playoff level heights. How the fuck was I supposed to compare them then since YOU brought it up? Using end of season stats was imperfect, but considering you chose to compare them then there was no other way to do so. Then you came guns blazing arguing how Steph has been lucky and how he was on a superteam.  &gt;SRS nitpick already covered above.  What nitpick? Those are facts.  &gt;I say Lonzo is a rookie, you say bullshit (he's a sophomore). The point is LeBron was running with an inexperienced core with significantly more injuries. All of this should be obvious.  And the point is he was also surrounded by vets. The injuries are what really make this an uncomparable situation. This should be obvious, yet you started bringing up supporting casts after all I said was Bron and Steph made their teams better."
"i mean its always a sellers market other teams don’t care what the Warriors motivations are because it will be a bidding war regardless, look at what PG, AD, Harden, Vucevic, Jrue Holiday all just got traded for, if you’re bargain shopping for a star you almost definitely wont fond one the only exception has been Jimmy Butler"
"I feel like guys don't want to put out their mental approach or how they see the game. I mean if you're Jrue Holiday, you'd probably use that info to better guard players like DLO."
Khris Middleton &amp; Jrue Holiday.
"lmao what? the pels FO surrounded AD with jrue holiday and prime boogie and rondo as well, along with decent shooters. unfortunately boogie had a career altering injury and there was obviously zero way they beat the KD warriors, which is out of the FOs control. Literally the next season, the pels added julius randle(didn't fit with the team but obviously a talented player) but boogies injury pretty much fucked them, and then AD went a requested a trade midway through the year"
Didn't expect to see Jrue Holiday slander here
Curious how this sub claims Jrue Holiday is better than Ben Simmons and at the same time says AD had zero help on the Pelicans and Embiid had a better supporting cast by far
"Giannis Jrue Holiday &gt; Embiid Simmons Tobi. The Bucks trio at worst should be 3 and at best should be 2. Also 8,9,10 are better than the Heat's trio imo."
He didn’t have success before because he always faced the warriors with Jrue Holiday as his second star.
"I'm not saying he is bad though. There is no doubt that Giannis being ""one dimensional"" in a way has hurt the Bucks in the playoffs. Teams tend to pack the paint and bother him. AD had worse teams around him most years when he was on the Pelicans in a tough Western conference. His big help was Jrue Holiday, who happens to be on the Bucks now as the 3rd option."
Jrue Holiday is a good enough second option that he should have been able to make the playoffs more than once in 6 years without another superstar
"Jrue Holiday is definitely good enough to be the #2 on a good team. AD is just a trash floor raiser relative to his overall skill level, does nothing to make his teammates better"
Because people's histories effect how we perceive their actions.  If Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday did this nobody would be debating if it was dirty either.
Eric Bledsoe struggles in the playoffs. replacing him with Jrue Holiday is going to make a huge difference for the Buck's offense come playoff time
"U gotta be trolling, right? Mikal Bridges, Oladipo or Jrue Holiday dont play better defense than Wiggins?"
not over jrue holiday
"Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley, Andre Iguadola, basically if you were a 2nd or 3rd option floor general and plus defender that wasn't a real rim protector that didn't rack up stats or accolades people are gonna look at you later like a bum."
"yeah exactly. out of Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday, Steph is the best PLAYER to not win DPOY. It’s simple."
I mean sure but that’s a stupid distinction. You could say Steph is better for DPOY than Jrue holiday or something then.
"Jrue Holiday against the Celtics in the Bubble series. The defense would be there which was crucial in that series, plus he could add the much needed offense we were sorely lacking."
Jrue Holiday to the Bucks over Bledsoe against Toronto
"Can confirm, he had a Milwaukee Jrue Holiday flair"
"Yes it is dude, he had a Jrue Holiday flair.  I genuinely don’t know what your taking about."
Bro he had a Jrue Holiday flair...  and I probably got to get off Reddit.
Jrue Holiday to the 15-16 Thunder instead of Roberson   Russ - Jrue - KD - Ibaka - Adams
I mean to be fair they also added jrue holiday and regressed in the regular season. Tbf I would have had him in the conversation but I wouldn't have given him his first mvp either. Problem is the league is stacked with talent so players are just going to get nitpicked to the death in comparison to other studs.
He's very confident in his ability to stick with anyone when he turns it up. Here he is dogging Jrue Holiday for an entire possession by himself: https://twitter.com/TomWestNBA/status/1385386173250605057?s=19
"One of the most annoying things this subreddit does is just point to a random moderate-high usage scorer on a terrible offense and try to psych itself out into believing that they are somehow better than players that are actually objectively better.   Like yeah dude, Nikola Vucevic on the Magic was totally better than Jrue Holiday."

"I get you but I haven’t made any of those strawman arguments in my replies. Just simply refuting this notion that he is one dimensional. FYI I’m a curry hater and I don’t rank him top 1 or 2 in PG all time. I couldn’t stand the guy saying he’s one dimensional is all.  I rest my case lol what I can request is you reevaluate how you assess passing or rebounding in general. Melo isn’t an elite rebounder but he is not an “average rebounder”. Fans standards are usually skewed against star players or hall of famers. There are 280 plus other players in the league with way “worse” skill sets. But these guys that u call bums/below average are actually elite compared to an average joe. You don’t get to be elite with very glaring weaknesses. I would argue that in your assessment, your definition of above average passing comes from borderline top all stars or mvp candidates. Rubio is an elite passer he is not above average. He is able to orchestrate an offense even as a sub 40% non scorer/shooter. Above average passers are someone like Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Draymond (his bball iq and timing make him an elite playmaker but he’s still an above average passer, similar to Steph) and the like."
"Yea I agree, they could use those trade assets to get a really good supporting player, maybe even someone as good as Jrue Holiday   /s if that wasn't obvious"
I think people forget some of the dog shit rosters the Pelicans had during his time. Everybody seems to think he had prime Jrue Holiday the entire time.   I was in another thread a couple days ago and somebody posted his game in 2016 that had the 8th highest game score ever in the NBA. [The starting lineup consisted of:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201602210DET.html)  Anthony Davis  Dante Cunningham  Norris Cole  Bryce Dejean-Jones  Omer Asik
"Michael Carter-Williams had 22/7/12 with 9 steals in his first career game   He played 70 games that season. Assuming he played 70 games for 8 years, while maintaining those numbers he’d have 12, 320 points   That’s more than Al Horford and Jrue Holiday"
"Absolutely awful coaching hire, into an awful Jrue holiday trade into an awful Adams extension. Ruining the relationship with Lonzo by trying to trade him at every opportunity he had when Lonzo's value was at it's absolute worst at the start of the season and now risking Lonzo walking away for absolutely nothing if one of chicago/knicks decide to overpay him. The roster construction is nonsensical. I mean I don't know what am I missing here? The bucks' super late first round picks that will magically turn things around? The mystical block buster trade that he'll make with said late round picks? Did anyone expect the Pelicans to miss out on the play-in with all the talent that they have? Was this season just an elaborate botched tank? What's the plan here, continue fostering a losing culture for years to come and pray you hit a home run 1st round pick? Are you sure BI won't get sick and tired of losing every single season of his career and decide to dip? I guess if paying attention is closing your eyes and being biased then yes I am 100% wrong here Griffin has been doing amazing, GM of the year material."
"Let it be known that the Rockets, led by KJ Martin, Kelly Olynyk, and DaQuan Jeffries are tied with the Bucks, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday after the first quarter."
"FWIW Luka plays with Porziņģis, Kleber, Finney-Smith and Richardson in the starting lineup, while LeBron plays with Schröder and KCP (both guards) and Harden plays with Kyrie Irving an actual PG.   Porziņģis, Kleber and Finney-Smith are all forwards/bigs and do not ever bring the ball up. Richardson is a guard/forward who can dribble here and there but is never asked to bring the ball up. It would be different if Luka was playing with Irving or Schröder who are true guards. Luka brings the ball up every play, and guards opposing guards/wings. He is 100% our PG. Now if we were able to get a player like Paul, Ball, Holiday etc... it would be more of a debate, because he'd share ball handling duties offensively, but would not be guarding opposing guards, thus making him a point-forward.  I think that's the goal going forward, heliocentric offenses hardly ever work in the playoffs (see 05-10 Cavs or 13-18 Rockets). We need a secondary ball handler. Someone like Jrue Holiday, Lonzo Ball would be great to pair next to Luka."
I think it’s more about the fact that the Lakers are going to be in trouble without a leader. Even in New Orleans he had Jrue Holiday for the bulk of his time there. He’s going to need a true number one to play with.
"A key piece is, just as you say, we started with Jrue Holiday. That was, quite literally, it. We didn't have the luxury of starting off with a MVP to trade like the Thunder did (and I love when they are doing, don't get me wrong)."
I don't think a player should get extra credit because he's doing it in the West. Jrue holiday too was injured for a period of time. The east is also a lot stronger than in the past.
KD is more than 2 ppg better than jrue holiday lol answer your own question   Idk what I expected from someone with a picture of Anthony edwards as their avatar  Edit: KD also averages like 3 more rebounds so you’re just spewing garbage at this point
ok And? Jrue Holiday is better at playmaking rebounding and defense than KD does that mean hes better than KD? And Yeah sure Lamelo does better but dont act like scoring is all that edwards can do
"Exactly. Bucks twitter and even Bucks fans here on reddit are screaming for Coach Bud to get fired with pitchforks, and yet Jrue Holiday said Coach Bud was one of, if not, the main reason he signed the extension with the Bucks."
"James harden and trae young have improved recently but still aren’t as good as people say they are. Trae is still a liability and harden is not an elite defender like some nets fans and skip bayless say he is. Also jrue holiday is one of the best perimeter defenders in the league when he’s giving max effort but lately he hasn’t been trying as hard, like when KPJ dropped 50 on him. Also  gallinari is one of the worst defenders in the league and nobody talks about it."
It was Jrue Holiday.... JRUE HOLIDAY!
"wrong, but then again the bucks proved that.  The nets offensive efficiency near the end of a close game is much better with harden distributing the ball.  And kyrie is much more dangerous when he can concentrate on what he does best, breaking down his man on the wing.  PG an be very physical, Id rather have Jrue holliday trying to guard harden as that wil wear holiday down instead of holliday wearing down Kyrie.  Ask KD, you dont think he knows that?  He knows more than any of us how the pieces fit.  Kyrie has never averaged more than 7 assists a game in 10 seasons.  What he does do is score with tremendous efficiency.  What harden does do is run the most efficient offense, the nets get lots of production out of guys like claxton, joe harris, and bruce brown.  What kyrie does best is breaking down his man in the clutch, better he has energy in the 4th quarter."
"yes, I agree, when you look at productivity and efficiency of guys like bruce brown, Nic claxton, jeff green and joe harris with harden running the offense its notably better.  Harden distorts the defense from the point, and finds these guys for easy shots.  Kyrie and KD score regardless of harden being on the floor, but even they are more efficient when harden runs the offense.  And opponents have to double harden, guys like Jrue Holiday do well against a smaller less physical Kyrie, but harden is a beast physically so holliday has his hands full, leaving a better mismatch for kyrie in that one case.  If harden doesnt come back healthy, I dont like the nets chances against the 76ers or Bucks.  You really want simmons and Jrue Holiday guarding harden, not kyrie.  this forces thybulle or others to guard Kyrie and I really like that matchup a lot better."

Somebody please get Jrue Holiday and Donte DiVincenzo some help! With a third star I think they could really make some noise in the playoffs
"First of all, we are arguing semantics...I said if Gobert is your primary player, the team would be bad..I was referring to primary offensive player since thats what people mean 99% of the time when we talk about team's best player. I don't agree with you that he is the Jazz's best player, I think Mitchell is, but you're free to think that he is.   Second, how the hell do you have any statistical basis for saying he is having a top 5 individual defensive season ever when its widely known defensive stats are terrible for tracking that type of thing? For the best advanced defensive stats I know of (DPM, DWS, Defensive rating), Gobert is no where near the top of the list of historical seasons for any of them.   [DPM Best Seasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dbpm_season.html)  [DWS Best Seasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dws_season.html)  [Defensive Rating](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/def_rtg_season.html)  &gt;Regardless of his individual offensive limitations his skills have translated to consistent, winning basketball and have allowed the Jazz to build a consistent, winning system around him.  He is surrounded by a deep, talented, well coached team..and has been for most seasons of his career...idk how you feel like you can just pin that strictly on him, he is a complementary player and clearly not your best player...nor would you be able to build any successful team with him as your best player.   You probably think Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday and other defensive specialists are the best players on their teams too...I guess someone should tell Giannis and Tatum that their bum asses are being carried."
"Jrue Holiday, while underrated on offense, is probably slightly overrated on defense.  Some of his effort can come and go a little bit on that end, some matchups sometimes give him trouble.   That said, he is very skilled on defense, so I am interested to see if he elevates his play in the postseason, cause I think he is capable of that."
"People talk about Dejounte Murray like he's amazing on defense and while he does play amazing defense occasionally, for the most part he's average to slightly above average. Just the last game he played, he was constantly letting Joe Ingles blow by him. Guys like Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday are far better defenders than him."
What makes Jrue Holiday specifically a role player?
They really put Jrue Holiday at 24?
"Maybe I’m just biased, but why is Jrue Holiday in the “No” category lol?"
Jrue Holiday &gt; Kyrie Irving confirmed
"I think people just get really amped up about players that they like on Reddit. Lonzo seems to be a player a lot of people are rooting for here, but anyone with functioning eyeballs can tell you that Lonzo has a long way to go to match the two way impact Jrue Holiday can bring to a team."
"u spitting facts... he had positive ""on/off diff"" once in his carrer... and this year he is in 1 percentile in defensive on/off stats, with derozan on the floor spurs allow 12.3 more points per 100 possesions.... Jrue holiday &gt;&gt; derozan"
All of a sudden jrue fuckimg holiday is chump change compared to Tobias harris or what?
"Yeah, Bam has had Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro, Andre Igoudala, Dwyane Wade on his team, while KAT's best form of help in his entire career is Andrew fucking wiggins. It's like saying Jrue Holiday is a better player than Lavine because of success"
"I hope so, I've been trying to get a Jrue Holiday Bucks jersey but the Bucks shop only has like one available and its the plain green one."
"I'd like to imagine that if i was good at basketball I would be like Jrue holiday. He is such a great person, a versatile player and a good leader. He's one of the players that inspires me the most."

First Jrue Holiday is more than just a “solid role player”. Second In general the term role player is pretty general and describes 95% of the league (I mean it ranges from Draymond Green to Ish Smith). Knowing this there are better comps for Lonzo besides Jrue because their games are so different.
“He’s a guard in New Orleans that has some defensive skill. He HAS TO BE Jrue Holiday”
Jrue “Jrue Holiday” Holiday
"The voting process for the All Team selections is pretty garbage. Like l stated, it's a popularity contest. There's no reason a guard like Jrue Holiday only has 2 All Defensive team selections when players all over the league (Damian Lillard, KD, JJ Reddick, Andre Igudola, etc.) say he's the best perimeter defender in the NBA.  Same thing with Jonathan Issac, Tony Allen for some early years, Jimmy Butler, Avery Bradley, AK-47, Robert Covington, and plenty of other players who were shafted in place of bigger names.  An NBA game is 48 minutes star players typically play 75% of that at 36mpg which is also where most of a games production occurs. If he is playing 20+ mpg  during productive stretches on the best team in his conference, which is also a title contender, l don't see how he isn't in the conversation. He plays ~10 minutes less than Ben (DPOY candidate) and Joel (an MVP candidate). That's less than a game's quarter. He has a plus / minus that shows his impact and it's all on the defensive end.  Dejounte Murray played roughly the same amount when he was selected. Tony Allen and PatBev had similar minutes as well in their years.  Don't look at other NBA outlets and analyst, see what the people he guards say about his defense. I presented the stats now go listen to his peers."
Jrue Holiday is the man
"He is 3rd for total deflections by a guard according to NBA.com/stats, behind FVV and TJ McConnell. He is also 5th for deflections per game behind Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, TJ McConnell and Fred VanVleet. If you consider Jimmy Butler a SG instead of a SF that pushes Thybulle to 6th."
"He is 4th in total deflections (193), tied with Ben Simmons and behind Fred VanVleet (194), TJ McConnell (217) and Robert Covington (229). Per game, he is 10th with 3.1 per game, behind OG Anunoby (3.2), Smart (3.3), Jrue Holiday (3.3), Larry Nance Jr (3.4), Butler (3.5), TJ McConnell (3.6), Covington (3.6), Ben Simmons (3.6) and Fred VanVleet (3.9)."
"Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker. Surprised there are Nets fans up this late, considering it's a school night and past your bedtime"
"I think Turner's value went up after everyone saw what Ayton did this post-season, but I have the feeling they want something close to the Jrue Holiday package, good luck, no one's desperate enough to do that."
"It's still pretty ridiculous, but the ""but not all"" part seems important. I would imagine they're requiring an all-star level player if the pick swaps are from teams that aren't super likely to convey and not requiring it if it's a team they think will convey the picks.  At any rate, still too high but we kinda went through this with an admittedly better player in Jrue Holiday, but also a much older player (and Simmons is very good in his own right too, not to mention already locked up long-term). Everyone freaked out about the price the Bucks paid for Holiday because it was reported as 5 first round picks or whatever when it's most likely ""only"" going to end up being 3 late first round picks."
Who would prefer him to Jrue Holiday?
"No lol  New Orleans Pelicans starting PG Jrue Holiday was limited to 55 minutes total and missed one game of the Warriors' sweep entirely coming off a stress reaction in his right tibia. Memphis Grizzlies starting PG Mike Conley missed Game 1 of the series with Golden State because of a facial fracture, and starting SF Tony Allen played just five minutes over the last two games because of a sore left hamstring. The Houston Rockets played without starting PG Patrick Beverley and backup F/C Donatas Motiejunas, while starting C Dwight Howard played through a torn MCL and torn meniscus suffered during the Western Conference finals. In the NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers were without starting PF Kevin Love because of shoulder surgery early in the playoffs and lost starting PG Kyrie Irving to a fractured patella late in Game 1."
"yes. Kyrie, PatBev, Mike Conley, and Jrue Holiday all had injuries."
"$34 million a season for Ayton? No, he’s not worth that. Not even close. You can throw Tre Mann or Jrue Holiday on him in the paint and they give him trouble.   He’s good when he’s open.. but so was Luc Longley."
So would Steph's first ring be seen in a better light if Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley each played 1 additional game?
I think they fared okay last year. And correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t the Bucks end up getting Jrue Holiday because they missed on Bogdanovic?
"In case you missed it, Holiday and Middleton did shoot like shit a lot of the time, and they still found ways to win. Lopez and Portis would feast against the Clippers if Jrue and Middleton were locked up."
"That's fair. I personally don't think Chris Paul or Jrue Holiday raise the ceiling for the Clippers as much as Paul George does (we saw the carry job he did against the Jazz and Suns after Leonard went down). Not only did Jrue get a huge extension and Chris Paul is in line for one as well but, SGA is extension eligible this summer so he's gonna start making even more money than George now.   Also it's not as simple as you're putting it. Teams with high level assets get those leveraged in most trades they try to discuss. It's why in Lowry deals you saw Masai (rumored) asking for Simmons and Maxey and/or Thybulle from the 76ers, Herro and Precious from Miami, but only THT and Danny Green from the Lakers.   Im sure the Nuggets have been going through something similar with Michael Porter Jr.. Opposing teams know what assets you have and they're not going to let you be stingy lol"
"Jrue Holiday went for 2 picks and 2 swaps, but wasn't even that expensive because they sent back the garbage Bledsoe contract which probably accounted for at least one of the FRPs just to get rid of him.  Chris Paul went for 1 FRP and a couple role players.  And loads of high quality role players have been traded in the past couple years that you could've easily got with just one FRP or less.  Plus there would be plenty of teams willing to part with good players if you offered them multiple firsts."
Jrue Holiday was
"I got it wrong, it looks like after the trade was agreed to then the Bucks lowered their offer to Bogdonovic after the Jrue Holiday trade.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/01/report-bucks-lowered-offer-to-bogdan-bogdanovic-due-to-jrue-holiday-trade/"
"I see people saying this, yet names never appear. Unless you are LA, NY or Miami, you won't have a bevy of All-Stars wanting a vet min to play with you just because they love Hollywood or South Beach or whatever. Jrue Holiday was the difference maker in a lot of Bucks games, he is being paid 26M and his stat sheet is 19/6/4 on a slightly above league average TS%.   If you are not a FA honey destination, you will need to overpay people and bank that they will improve. On this, Lonzo is a really good player to bank, specially if you already have your superstar averaging 25ppg. Good defender, good perimeter shooter, has BBIQ, has vision. He doesn't need to slash or crash for rebounds if he gives your #1 time to breathe and improve the looks for your #2."
More athletic Jrue Holiday
It was also due to jrue holiday playing very very good defense on him
"Suggs more of a combo guard like Jrue Holiday and Malcolm Brogdon are  He’s gonna be a really good on ball defender, over all help disruptor off ball too. He can operate PnR better than Lonzo because he’s a better driver and finisher, he can hit some really sick head pass in transition nicely too.   What he lacks is off dribble shooting, handles not tight at all or good enough to be a lead guard like Morant or Fox or Trae Young, and his passing accuracy is not that good to be the primary facilitator either."
"Oh, you're one of those. Yea the team would be much better off it they had built around Jrue Holiday as a #1 option  Ask Robert Covington and TJ McConnell how much they hated getting a real shot at NBA minutes"
"Lowry on the pelicans is so funny to me, like they just traded  Jrue Holiday, like they do the same thing"
"BTW, a key part of the Bucks' recent finals run was the first victim of the Process - Jrue Holiday was shipped out of town for the Nerlens Noel pick.  Note that he was on-sold by New Orleans to the Bucks for a decent pile of picks, plus the ghost of Eric Bledsoe ..."
I don't think it's a Ben Simmons situation where they're actively shopping him.  More like a Jrue Holiday scenario where they're listening to offers and won't say no to an overpay.
I mean you just saw it against Chris Paul with jrue holiday for 6games. It’s hard for players to do it for 82 games the. Then playoffs. These tournaments are quick so they can choose to do that
"Wifh Jrue Holiday getting traded Zo had the chance to become the lead guard. Griffin then hired SVG who wanted him off ball and paired him with another PG in Bledsoe who was a dogshit fit. Then he went ahead and drafted ANOTHER pg as his insurance policy, tried to shop him mid season, called him a rotational piece and now he will just match and welcome him back with open arms?  Cmon man, this shit sounds ridiculous  Zo wants to play PG, thats why he wants to be im Chicago and not in Nola under Griffin"
"max player doesn't mean superstar.  &amp;#x200B;  Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are not on the same level as Giannis, Harden, KD, and Kyrie Irving. They're great players, to be sure, with their own strengths that Harden and Kyrie may not have, and you'd rather have them in some situations (defensively), but they aren't superstars.  &amp;#x200B;  The league has a salary cap. If the NBA had a free market Kyrie and Harden would be making a lot more money than Middleton and Jrue."
"Jrue Holiday nor Kris Middleton are ""above average role players"". Those are 3 all star caliber players that were also elite defensively, ""elite defensively"" being the key factor. The point is, this Celtics franchise will be no more or less successful relative to a championship with Evan Fournier, and at 4/80 or 3/60, there's a lot better argument that our odds increase if we don't match an offer like that."
That's hyperbole lmao. Jrue holiday is an amazing bird option
"John wall, ty lawson, Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, Eric bledsoe."
that jrue holiday fellow could easily lock down a midget senior citizen point guard in the nba imo
"Not a chance, they're both similar in terms of skill (AD the better shooter) but Giannis is much more of a leader and is way more durable than day-to-davis. Curious to see how AD would've fared with a Khris Middleton type player in 17-18 and Jrue Holiday"
This is as idiotic as the Khris Middleton is the batman take  Sure he closes but Giannis is still the main guy  Jrue Holiday did the exact same thing for the Bucks this year he clamped up CP3 in games 3 and 4 and Booker in game 6 where's the love for him?
he had one consistent player through the years who missed a lot of games and never was a all-star in Jrue Holiday.
I got called a misogynist because I said Jrue holiday is a better athlete than his wife.
good thing jrue holiday didn't lock up kevin durant lol
You could say the same thing about Jrue Holiday against KD and all those other guys he clamped.
"The problem with Clippers Bucks is that with Kawhi Injured, i thought that the Bucks could easily beat them, especially with perimeter defenders like Jrue Holiday and to a lesser extent, P.J. And Khris."
"Kyle Lowry still won and proved he is a winner, tbh not just Lowry but I would also take Jrue Holiday and Rondo over CP0 because they can actually win when it matters"
Trae Young   Steph Curry   Damian Lillard   Jrue Holiday   Kyle Lowry    *Their rain of threes shall blot out the sun*
"True, but  jrue holiday shot 4-19 and 4-20 in those games. The bucks aren’t the best the eastern conference has to offer either it’s only going to get harder for the suns. There won’t be as many injuries to superstars next year. This was probably their best chance with chris Paul and I just feel the suns are really limiting themselves with him."
"&gt;He can be much more efficient.  That doesn't change the fact that he's already efficient?  Taking out Game 6 of the Bucks series when he was injured, he put up 29.8ppg on 56.2% TS with 9.5ast/3.9tov. That's with playing the 10 of the 15 games in the sample being played against Ben Simmons and Jrue Holiday who are the two best perimeter defenders in the NBA. The other 5 were against the Knicks, who were #1 in opp ppg in the regular season, and 3rd in defensive rating in the regular season.   You always *can* be more efficient, but dropping 30 a game on good efficiency while running about as hard of a gauntlet as you could run as the lone star on a team makes critiques of his efficiency ring pretty hollow."
"You are delusional if you think he is a top 3 PG. Lillard, Curry, Trae Young, Kyrie, Jrue Holiday, CP3 and Luka are all much better. And I would still prefer a healthy Jamal Murray, Lowry and Ja Morant above Russ."
"I would definitely take Jrue Holiday before Westbrook now, especially in the playoffs."
"The Bucks are the second closest to a superteam. They literally have Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton to play with Giannis, plus more defensive support from PJ and Lopez. Other superstars like Dame, Luka and Harden would have loved to play with players like that. They’re better than the 2019 Raptors. A real championship team are the 2011 Mavs or the 2015 Warriors."
Fun fact: Team USA didn't look like Team USA until NBA CHAMPION JRUE HOLIDAY AND NBA CHAMPION KRIS 'KASH' MIDDLETON SHOWED UP IN JAPAN.
"Ayton and the Suns got ate up because no one in the league can guard Giannis IN SPACE one on one. That’s the big difference from this year and previous years. The Raptors and Heat were comfortable leaving Eric Bledsoe and helping on any Giannis drive. Additionally, this Finals Connaughton and Portis shooting the lights out were swing factors in the closing games.    Shooting percentage isn’t exactly equivalent to spacing. No matter how similar their percentages are Jrue Holiday and Eric Bledsoe will never be guarded the same. Middleton could be 1-13 but I don’t think any good defense would want to leave him open from 3."
"It's easy to know if the process was a success or a failure if you know what the objective was when it started.  It was started because the Sixers couldn't get past the 2nd round of the playoffs.  The process started in earnest when they shock-traded their superstar point guard Jrue Holiday away to New Orleans.  That guy now has a ring and was an integral part of his team getting one, and the Sixers haven't gotten past the 2nd round of the playoffs. The answer is obvious.  Especially if you were there when ""The process"" started."
Jrue holiday did it vs booker in the finals
"That’s odd to me - given that there are bigger non-US celebrities like Naomi Osaka, Luka Doncic or Usain Bolt that the general public would recognize over a Jrue Holiday.  Or non-basketball celebrities from the US like Simone Biles or Michael Phelps."
"Ah, I knew they had one natural pick from before Hinkie was hired and then another pick which they got for Jrue Holiday, and that it was Nerlens Noel. I thought it was #11 instead of #6 though."
"Correction for 2013: The Sixers traded all-star Jrue Holiday for pick #6 in that draft which was Nerlens Noel.  That was the move that really kicked off the Process, so you should look at #6 in those other time periods rather than #11."
"Right now, Russel Westbrook is not a better player than Jrue Holiday. Pretty much all teams in the League would preffer the later over the former"
"Right now, Russel Westbrook is not a better player than Jrue Holiday. Pretty much all teams in the League would preffer the later over the former"
"I would consider them one but they are a super team done right, Kris Middleton averaged more points than AD in last years finals and they had Jrue holiday who is an elite defender. Not to mention a pretty solid bench even though some good pieces were injured. Definitely not a super team by names alone though like Kylie Harden and KD"
"I would consider them one but they are a super team done right, Kris Middleton averaged more points than AD in last years finals and they had Jrue holiday who is an elite defender. Not to mention a pretty solid bench even though some good pieces were injured. Definitely not a super team by names alone though like Kylie Harden and KD"
"I like both KG and Dirk and can't really separate the two, but the fact that he is using AD to back up his argument is ridiculous. AD had to join Lebron to win his ring or have any playoff success whatsoever. AD was paired with a top 25-30 star in Jrue Holiday and he did fuck all. The other top power forward of this generation had Jrue for 1 year and they won a NBA championship."
"Oh my bad. Misinterpreted the chain. Yeah Beasley and Bledsoe packages would be about same value for sure.  I agree w the other guy saying the value of Simmons and Jrue isn't comparable in terms of what they'll get traded for though. You say they could be at least comparable - and yes, they can definitely be compared. But I just don't see Morey of all people giving up an under 25 All-Star, DPOY candidate (who, yes, does have a lot of flaws also) whose under contract for many more years, for the same package that an aging Holiday who was in his last year of a deal. I think Simmons will command a lot more than Beasley + filler + picks personally."
"Be aware that the first player shipped out in The Process was Jrue Holiday, who was an absolutely key part of the Bucks championship this year.  Arguably, the Process Sixers had their best shot in 2019, with Jimmy Butler.  The future comes at you faster than you think."
Jrue Holiday is not and has never been even close to an MVP caliber player
Westbrook is not a better player than Jrue Holiday ...
How did they prove that? Jrue Holiday is a much better shooter than Westbrook....unless you were making a joke about Giannis being their point guard
"The way I see it I think both Sengun and Garuba are high potential and they both can be *really* good. Nothing needs to be said for Jalen Green either, that guy has superstar written all over him.  I just think the most vital thing here is time. The Rockets need to let all four of their draft picks this year as well as Porter Jr. and Wood to get a solid 3-5 years to gel and see what they have.  Fans got to be patient here and not call for any players' heads so early - that's how you give other teams championship players. Look what happened to AD and Jrue Holiday for example. New Orleans had both and all they had to do was add another piece or two, not blow it up."
"I still wouldn't want him over Lillard or Holiday...it's honestly absurd to me that I would even consider it.  Trae's greatest asset is that he can get open looks for people who cannot get them for themselves, and while that is a tremendous asset, it isn't one this olympic squad needs. They can all get their own quality looks, so Trae's strengths aren't as relevant. At the end of the day, Lillard is a better scorer, better defender, better passer, more experienced guard and while we can go back and forth comparing the offensive merits of Jrue Holiday, his defense is why he's there and Trae is lightyears behind Jrue as a defender.  Substituting Trae in for any of the guards he could conceivably replace makes the Olympic team worse."
"Yea it's because you're delusional. Kevin Durant is currently the best player I'm the league and NO ONE, thinks Davis is better than Harden. Davis is an injury prone center who's won 5 playoff games as a first option. Harden carried literal bums to deep playoff runs year after year and nearly beat the best team of all time. Anthony Davis couldn't even make the playoffs every year with Jrue Holiday before he bailed out."
"I'm concerned about the overall offensive output for the Raptors too, but by all accounts Suggs wasn't going to be that guy himself. He's more like a Jrue Holiday kind of archetype."
"They simply don't have chemistry because they lack continuity in their programs and covid makes it even worse. Even the core of the ""Redeem"" team went back and practiced every summer. Other teams have a core that have decades of experience playing with one another. It is incomparable to Jrue Holiday joining the team on the day of their first match."
"No, Brandon Jennings was DRAFTED by the Bucks with the 10th pick, they had to use him to acquire Middleton. Giannis was DRAFTED by the Bucks. Jrue Holiday was traded for DRAFT picks.  Without the draft the Bucks best player is Brook Lopez. The Lakers would have LeBron and the Nets would have KD/Kyrie.  Honestly, at this point I am gonna assume you are trolling."
"Yeah I really like the Jrue Holiday comparison for him. Hopefully a decent enough shooter but not a flamethrower, smart player who can run an offense if needed but probably works best as a secondary ball-handler, and an absolute terror at both guard spots on defense. Dejounte Murray also comes to mind."
lakers were desperate to make a move. Thats like looking at the jrue holiday trade in. a vaccuum and saying oh jrue went for X and someone else went for Y.
I think it’s more like if he switches on the perimeter he can hold his own against some 3s/4s a la Jrue Holiday  That’s the optimistic take anyway
"I can make a list of point guards better than him and then add on other guys as well from other positions and he's clearly in the 30 to 40 range as a player.  Off the top of my head.  CP3 Steph Dame Trae Young Jrue Holiday Ja Morant Kyrie Irving are all point guards better than Russ.  You can argue Ben Simmons (I won't) but that's the range where Russ is.  And then we have players who are better like Beal, Bam, Butler, PG 13, Middleton, Booker, Tatum, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Gobert, KAT.  And then you add Harden Lebron Jokic AD Giannis Luka Kawhi Donovan Mitchell so yeah he's in the thirties clearly."
"He would have had more home runs like Jahlil Okafor and Michael Carter-Williams? The Jrue Holiday - Nerlens Noel trade?   I'm not saying it can't succeed, but I'm saying it's the easy part of a GM's job, to sell everybody, to take in bad contracts.  And it's a way to sell hope to your fans."
"I don't really understand this logic fully. All we need to do is be the highest single bidder on whatever trade, is a team going to not take our highest bid just because we have a lot more assets to give up? I understand it doesn't work perfectly because we don't have 100% knowledge of every bid but I don't get how people think having so many assets will all of sudden become more of a disadvantage than it is an advantage in these trades.   We have enough to make 3 Jrue Holiday style packages immediately without giving up Shai or Dort and still have a normal amount of picks leftover. The last two seasons have been about taking high ceiling guys and accumulating future picks and then next offseason we'll start slinging these around and every all-star that comes on the market we will be in the conversation for."
"He’s at the bottom tier of fg% no doubt.  So Dillon Brooks, Christian Wood, Jrue Holiday, Porzingus, are volume shooters?  Edit: is Tobias Harris a volume shooter too?"
Scottie Barnes will be Andre Iguodala  Jalen Suggs will be Jrue Holiday
Yet jrue holiday wasn’t a candidate for dpoy and Simmons was
Yea and cp3 struggled against jrue holiday and pj tucker what do u think Ben Simmons gonna do to him who a top defensive player this year.
what are you on buddy? why are you so mad over a simple question? lmfao jesus  Khris Middleton is a 42% career 3 point shooter  Jrue Holiday is a 39% career 3 point shooter  PJ Tucker is a 36% career 3 point shooter  Lopez is literally the only one who's shaky at 34%  Why the fuck are you cherry-picking finals stats to try and prove your dumb take?   So many questions...
"Jrue Holiday only shot a blistering 30% from three in the playoffs.  He wasn't that good from 3 that it made such a big difference, his defense on guys was the difference maker."
Aaron Holiday is to Justin Holiday what Justin Holiday is to Jrue Holiday
Gregg popovich best bet to win gold this year is  Pg jrue holiday or dame  Sg khris Middleton Sf jayson tatum  Pf draymond green or Keldon Johnson  C bambam or javele McGee
"&gt; He'll miss a game here and there, but people acting like he's constantly out half the season are just wrong. Most of his absences happened early on when New Orleans was still using the Saints football staff to take care of their basketball team, and it wasn't just him who was out a lot, it was everyone (Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Tyreke Evans, Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, etc).  &gt; I know you guys all have your hopes pinned to LeBron and AD suffering season or career ending injuries on opening night (great look for you, btw 😬😬), but it's not like that's a lock to happen. Sorry.  Nope, he only referred to New Orleans..? Nothing about a shortened season."
"* 2016-17 - He missed 7 games all year  * 2017-18 - He missed 7 games all year  * 2018-19 - He missed 5 games before his trade demand, then the Pels sat him out a ton to protect his trade value  * 2019-20 - He missed 9 games all year  He'll miss a game here and there, but people acting like he's constantly out half the season are just wrong.

I know you guys all have your hopes pinned to LeBron and AD suffering season or career ending injuries on opening night (great look for you, btw 😬😬), but it's not like that's a lock to happen.

"On the bright side for me, I've been a Scottie Barnes stan since before OKC fell to #6 in the lottery. Toronto's development team will probably prove me right about him. He's going to be great. Less sure about Suggs now, oops. I still think he'll be great, but he might be more like Jrue Holiday at his peak than a legit multiple-time-all-star type of player. But hey, I mean shit, Jrue's a champion."
"I do think they shouldn’t have taken another guard, but I think davion can be a smaller jrue holiday. Some of the best on ball defense I’ve seen in college and lightning quick with handles"
"I like the player but I'm unsure about the fit.   Davion Mitchell: A 6’2 guard coming off of a NCAA National Championship. Mitchell has a good combination of speed and ball control that allow him to create driving lanes and separation for pull up jumpers. Mitchell developed into an above average 3 point shooter (44% on 141 attempts) in his final season at Baylor. His questionable free throw shooting presents a question about his shooting though, did he just have a good year? As we all know free throw percentage can be indicative of shooting potential. Regardless Mitchell has the potential to be a 3 level scorer in the NBA at the guard position, exactly what every single team in the league is looking for. I believe Mitchell can be a player who can thrive with control of the offense for stretches but I would like to see him on a team that has multiple options for ball handlers, he is a playmaker but appears to be a scorer at heart.    On the defensive end Davion Mitchell provides strong defense on the ball but may have a limited ceiling on this end due to being a smaller guard. That being said there is definitely a place in the league for a guard that can excel playing on ball defense against other guards, as we recently saw with Jrue Holiday. I’d like to see Mitchell land somewhere with established wing scorer that can take some of the playmaking responsibilities and allow Mitchell to be a scoring guard.  &amp;#x200B;  More words here: https://www.picknscroll.com/2021/07/2021-nba-draft-3-prospects-to-watch.html"
The second coming of Jrue Holiday hopes every Sacramento fan
"Seriously. Suggs and Wagner are winning players. Those are guys who fit right into playoff rotations all around the league, assuming Suggs ends up resembling Jrue Holiday like he's supposed to and assuming Wagner ends up becoming a do-everything-switchable wing/forward like he's supposed to. I say ""like he's supposed to,"" but these are both high floor guys."
I think Suggs can be a Jrue Holiday/Mike Conley hybrid if he hits his peak
"They hit like six threes a game because they were scoring inside...because the court was so spaced. You don't stop guarding Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday and Pat Connaughton just because they're cold."
"Didn’t the Bucks just get Jrue Holiday last year and Brook Lopez played on the Bucks for only 3 years, he was on the Nets for a decade. If anything teams like the Hawks are the ones you should be cheering for"
Jrue Holiday-esque
"Again, I have to disagree there. And I want to be clear I think he's a great defender, but he's not among the best of the best.   Excluding centers to me only really takes out Gobert, Bam, and Embiid (unless guys who can toggle to that position, like Dray and Giannis, are discounted, but I feel both end up on the perimeter enough to make it comparable). But to be clear I'd take all 3 over Ben.  The Warriors were just a step behind the 6ers on D, with a lot less in the way of quality defenders at every position but whatever we say Dray plays. Even if they were comparable in on-court quality (and I think Dray is a cut above because of his versatility and anticipation/ability to blow up plays), what Draymond brings in terms of organizing ability, communication, on the floor coaching, accountability, etc are so large a contribution it puts him at another level. He's damn near a whole system unto himself.   Giannis can toggle between wing and big defense much better than Simmons, is a much better as a help defender and as a rim protector. To me more than makes up for him being behind Simmons on the perimeter.  And he stepped up his defense under the most pressure, and that counts a lot for me.   Similarly, I think Jrue Holiday showed what he could do on D at the highest pressure moments. I'd take him over Ben on D, though I'd say this one is much closer, and if you take Ben fair enough. I'd be hard pressed to call him much more valuable than Jrue tho.   But again, I don't even think Simmons is better on the perimeter than Thybulle."
westbrook is less valuable than jrue holiday and kris middleton so...
"&gt; Are you leaving Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker and Lopez wide open for 3?  Middleton definitely not, everyone else you do. They got plenty of wide-open shots and bricked lots of them. Bobby was great at making wide-open 3s this season, problem is he only shot the wide-open ones and passed up many open looks."
"Are you leaving Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker and Lopez wide open for 3?  They shoot well enough to space the floor appropriately for Giannis.  Jrue, Khris and Giannis can create their own shot.  They meet the criteria easily"
"Bad deals will always be masked by wins. The opposite is also true. Bad deals will haunt you with losses.   What Jrue Holiday proved, even when streaky offensively, his defense got them over the hump. Everything up to that point didn’t work. Giannis also took a big leap in the Finals. That 50 burger and 17/19 from the FT line is the stamp he needed to go along with the chip.   The Suns enduring the gentleman’s sweep is rough. At this point, CP3 will likely never win a chip. Some players are just cursed that way. Knicks and Ewing would have won a chip if they didn’t have to fight through Jordan. The irony is that Ewing made it back to the Finals in a lockout year, and he was just a shell of himself. Houston and San Antonio were just the better teams."
"I might be an idiot but what happens if a pick swap turns out to be useless? For example, the Bucks gave the Pelicans 2 future first round picks and 2 future swaps to get Jrue Holiday. If the Bucks are better than the Pelicans in those years, are those swaps useless or do the Pelicans get something else for compensation?"
"Jrue Holiday hauled Adams, Bledsoe, two FRPs and two swaps. Ben Simmons value may be low but some people think we can do a player swap for Kyle Lowry and that it seems fair lmao. I just want the situation to be over with so I don’t have to listen to the the armchair GMs anymore."
Because it's not true lmfao. Replacing Green and Thybulle with Lowry hardly moves the needle for us in terms of a match up with the Bucks.   An aging Lowry being defended by Jrue Holiday would not end well for us
"&gt; Trading Jrue Holiday while team is trying to win now while taking back Eric Bledsoe  this was not the situation at all, but ok."
"i realize Jrue Holiday and getting off Bledsoe warranted five picks, but Daryl's crazy if he thinks any other team is ""one Ben Simmons away"" from resigning a Giannis-esque player and winning a chip lol there is zero chance if the asking price remains SEVEN picks and a DeJounte Murray or Derrick White level player."
"Jevon Carter. I’m telling y’all when he can get to a team where he can really flourish off the bench, later on he can finally become a starter somewhere. He’s with the nets right now and just left the suns, his defense is insane he can be a Kawhi or Jrue Holiday type defender. He’s also a better shooter than most think. That’s just me"
"Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum, Jrue Holiday"
"Hasn’t player yet, but Davion Mitchell. He’s legit the best on ball defender I’ve ever watched in college and I think his improvement in his jumped is legit and it wasn’t a fluke. Had him right there with Suggs in terms of draft rankings. Also has very under appreciated play making. Dude is Jrue Holiday 2.0 if you ask me"
"Pre-draft people were comparing Davion Mitchell to Marcus Smart, and god do I hope that pans out—I fucking LOVE Marcus Smart.  (The Jrue Holiday comps are cool too)"
"Uhh, the bucks? Jrue Holiday had more assists than anyone in the playoffs."
Lol 1 first team all nba defense for Jrue holiday  Kobe really conned people into giving him NINE first team all nba defense selections because he played good defense in like 2000 and 2001. Even though Phil Jackson in his book in 2004 called him out saying he had just been coasting off reputation on defense for years even by that point forget about the years after
"Jrue Holiday WAS very underrated until people saw the kind of elite defense he played in the Playoffs. Top 5 perimeter defender. Streaky offensively, but … still underrated"

"You're on point with the conferences but AD has always had Jrue Holiday (though he did get injured in 2015) who has proven to be able to help you win, Joel would probably kill for Jrue instead of having Ben."
"""Jrue Holiday is so underrated bro"""
Jrue holiday hands down like 6:30
"If we’re doing hypotheticals, if Jrue Holiday shot close to his regular season splits during the playoffs, the bucks title run would look dominant"
"Rudy Gobert Nikola Vucevic until very recently, Jrue Holiday"
"I don't know who it is right now, but I know this award belonged to Jrue Holiday"

jrue holiday /s
Menacing!!!!  His stand: Jrue on Holiday
Who on the Nets was going to contribute? No one lol. Everyone that could contribute did.   Let’s ignore than Jrue shot 5 of 23 (21% from the field) and 2 of 9 (22% from 3) and Khris shot 9 of 26 (34% from the field) and 2 of 7 (28% from 3) but yeah they definitely helped Giannis didn’t they? Aside from 2 buckets in the 4th Holiday wasn’t doing anything besides defense and aside from a few buckets in the 4th and one in OT Khris wasn’t doing anything.   That’s how those two played most of the games in that series aside from one or two good performances from   Khris. But yeah you’re right Giannis didn’t carry that team by himself.
I feel like 6’2 or under being the qualifier was meant to get rid of Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday is listed at 6’3’’ so he’s close and he’s arguably the best defender in the league
"They don’t have the same personnel as the raptors heat did, but I’m really confused why they didn’t switch it up at least a little. It’s not like they were playing the nets with sharpshooters all over the court, pj Tucker is a bad shooter at this point and jrue holiday shot 4-19 and 4-20 in games they won.   If I’m Monty I’m kicking myself for not switching it up."
"??? Giannis arguably had a better game statistically.   KD scored 8 more points on a whopping 12 more shots. Giannis was much more efficient, rebounded much better (predictable but still worth mentioning), and hit a bunch of clutch shots including the game-tying bucket.   If we’re bringing up supporting cast, Khris and Jrue played well below their standard offensively. Middleton shot 9/26 and Holiday shot 5/23. It’s legitimately and argument and this game, while impressive for KD, proved absolutely nothing in a KD/Giannis debate. Giannis really couldn’t have played much better than he did that game."
Jrue Holiday ran 2.82 miles per game back in 2019 that led the leauge..

"I can’t remember exactly who said it, think maybe it was Jrue Holiday, but they said during the playoffs, to stop Steph from going off, they basically try and foul him as much as they can and see what the refs let them get away with(ie. A lot) because there’s no other legitimate way to stop him"
"I'd argue he ""regressed defensively"" due to how easy it was to score on the Pelicans as a whole.   BI, Zion, Steven Adams, and Eric Bledsoe were literally training cones on defense and no matter what Zo did alone, his numbers were slated to drop. He's not Jrue Holiday levels because he doesn't have the strength to match up with the top scorers but his team defense overall is top tier in my opinion. Dude is almost always there defending the right play or at least in the vicinity of where he should be. Once he muscles up and gets a bit more physical I can see him going back to being top 3 in advanced defensive stats"
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

The 2019 Bucks with a 26 years old Giannis instead of his younger version of him in his first big series of his career AND Jrue Holiday instead of Bledsoe they beat the Raptors in 6 or 7 games so in the end it doesn't matter.
Other than sweeping the team we choose to root for about half a dozen years ago   I'm still really 🧂y olshey didn't find a way to get Jrue Holiday alongside Dame.

Jrue Holiday with the Sixers..  He was so good they couldn’t not compete with him... had to get rid of him in order to start the Process.
Jrue holiday started the renaissance Trend. Others jumped on afterwards
I think the 2 time dpoy is the best help defender in the league and amazing at defending the rim.   That does not mean he is great at playing lockdown defense. He gets caught on screens because he's so big and isn't quickly to go over them laterally in the same way as Jrue Holiday.  Best an amazing defender doesn't mean you're amazing at everything on defense and not being amazing on everything at defense doesn't mean you're a fraud.
Not to mention NBA champ and Gold Medalist Jrue Holiday whose trade arguably started the whole process in the first place
"I wouldn’t say you can just automatically consider them better, but fine to not compare them until they’ve had a consistent run in the NBA. Idk how KPJ can drop 50 points on Jrue Holiday and have several nights of 12+ assists and say he’s not as good as them because he hasn’t been in the league as long… It’s like saying Jared Dudley is better than Cade or Green because he’s been in the league longer"
"Right Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are superstars, my bad. So why weren't they allstars last season?"
"Ok, you don’t have to give a shit if you don’t want to. I do, therefore it affects my opinion. The Suns were marginally better than the Grizzlies. From a defensive standpoint I would definitely choose the Grizzlies which is more important when we’re discussing their effectiveness as primary scoring options.  &gt;use your eyeballs man  This is just something people say when the stats don’t agree with what they’re saying. Would if help if I said my eyeballs told me that Giannis was a good, not great playmaker in the finals? Your eye test is no more reliable than mine. Yes, I’m going to use statistics to back up my argument and no, you pulling the “eye test” argument doesn’t do anything for me. Jrue Holiday averaged 9 assists per game in the finals btw. Giannis was third in assists per game for the Bucks. Kawhi was first for the Spurs."
"Zion needs spacing. This is obvious, but it's a bit of a conundrum  when you realize he ALSO needs a defensive big alongside him. As another commenter mentioned, a player ala Ibaka could do the trick. Next to that, you would want to copy the Giannis model with the Bucks and get a 3 level scoring wing ala Khris, the secondary offensive option, the closer. It is absolutely vital that this wing can shoot well in the clutch and is super dependable at the line. From there, honestly, Jrue Holiday would be perfect at PG. A defensive behemoth who can score, rebound and playmake. Since he isn't available, a pure playmaking PG that can stretch the floor, and a SG just goes to a big shooter."
"I bet Jrue Holiday would be a good fit, imagine the alley oops from someone like Lonzo, probably try to get a rim protector like Derrick Favors too, maybe a shooter Reddick maybe(would prefer someone younger tho)"
"Shooters, star guard who can defend/shoot/ facilitate a bit and a defensive big along side him.  Basically you guys should have kept Jrue Holiday."
Jrue Holiday was literally Michael Jeffrey Jordan for 4 games
&gt;I’m not sure they do the trade for Jrue Holiday if they got Bogi.  Jrue trade happened a day before Iirc.
"Blessing in disguise for the Bucks.   I’m not sure they do the trade for Jrue Holiday if they got Bogi. Jrue’s defense helped them get over that hump for the championship.   Bogi is overrated af, so I’m glad we didn’t re-sign him. Just wish we got something in return"
"Great list, SG position is in a good place right now thanks to them.   No superstar here, yet. Donovan might get there. D.Book is a generational scorer who will get better and has a high ceiling. Beal has peaked on bad teams. Lavine is impressive but needs to be on a winning team being clutch and buying in defensively before he can climb above the other 3.   I feel bad for Beal because he's older and in a bad situation with the Wizards. Lavine will be the reason the Bulls fail or succeed, and I don't think he's ready to be an elite competitor that wins playoff series against good defensive squads. He can get there though but i don't think he's a good enough 2 way player/leader.   Long story short, Booker and Mitchell have the potential to alter the NBA landscape in a way you almost need a top 10 player to carry you through a playoff run. I don't think Lavine and Beal have that same potential. I could see Beal being part of a Cinderella run and winning one, but not on the Wizards, more like the missing piece if he got traded. Would be a perfect Middleton replacement on the Bucks for example. Also, huge shout-out to Jrue Holiday, definition of a winner. Not getting enough credit for being a true difference maker because defense matters more than we speak of it.   1A Mitchell 1B Booker 3 Beal (at least as good as D.Book right now, but older &amp; worse situation) 4 Lavine   Apologies for the rant and thanks for making it this far."
Jrue Holiday  and Jeremy Grant
"Reverse the draft, best teams draft first.  Kills tanking, stops sending the best prospects to the worst situations to screw up their careers, puts a twist on the 'here's four firsts for your best player' trades because they could be really good picks (think Jrue Holiday trade).  And lets face it, dynasties and big market bullies are good for the league, sending a top player to Cleveland to die every season isn't.  Reward bad teams with more cap space or something.  You want to get out of the basement, pull out your checkbook at prove it."
"Bucks winning a championship this year is going to be worse long term than losing.  -The FO is OK, nothing spectacular. Not bad either.  -Coach Bud is bad. Watching the offense in the Finals was depressing. He let Holiday play out of control. Over and over again.   - Middletons offense will age well, but his defense will slide fast. He isnt fast to begin with, so any loss of foot speed and its over.  - Jrue is a fantastic player, but I think his defense is slightly overstated and his offense game needs more refinement   - they won't ever get an easier path to the Finals again.  I think Giannis losing would have pushed him more. He needs to become a below average shooter to make that next step.  I love the Bucks, but I dislike Coach bud a lot. Hes lucky he had the roster he did.  I wished they had lost and Carlisle would have gone to Milwaukee."
Right but a lotta the reason for the success the bucks had this year in the playoffs was deciding to use giannis in a more secondary role as a pnr partner and rim roller with Kash money and jrue holiday being primary ball handlers
"sorry this is the internet and we're strangers, i genuinely didn't think anyone in this entire thread was being hostile at any point, including you and me lol  &gt; And Ja Morant is in a tier above Brogdon and Lonzo and definitely not average   if we say ""above average"" is the top-10 pgs, ""average"" is the 11-20 pgs, and ""below average"" is the 21-30 pgs, that would mean that Ja is a top-10 PG?  so better than three of:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  which three here would you take Ja over for a game today?  i'm not disagreeing or being hostile i'm genuinely curious."
"maybe because people don't understand how words work, but how many fans if they sat down and thought about it would say he's better than at least 4 guys on this list:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  Brogdon  Sexton  Lamelo Ball  Lonzo Ball  Ja Morant  I think he is definitely worse than all of these guys, and he would need to be better than three of them to even be ""average""."
"If God, AD, and Jrue Holiday were triple teaming Curry he’d still hit it"
God AD and Jrue Holiday double teaming you? It's okay just shoot it from 35 feet.

Jrue Holiday will eat his lunch
"Not a good playmaker. Dude you dumb as rocks, DLo is not only a good playmaker, he's a great (but not elite) playmaker. He's a comparable or better playmaker than Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De'Aaron Fox, Jrue Holiday, Donovan Mitchell, and Brandon Ingram. Some of these guys benefit from having a more aggressive scoring game and being the clear focal point of their team (Dame, Ja, Fox), and some of these guys numbers are depressed because of the team and system within which they play (according to my eye: Donovan Mitchell for sure, maybe BI)."
"Luka should be paired with someone like Jimmy Butler or Jrue Holiday.  If we’re taking bigs, maybe Bam."
"I think that Tier is around where Holiday should be if you factor his regular season. You can say Tier 3B instead of 3A.   Jrue was good in the regular season, he was a monster defensively in the playoffs despite offensive struggle and was clearly impactful by the numbers. Ayton was worse than Jrue in the regular season and not as impactful in the playoffs overall imo."
"Reasonable people can disagree with any single placement on the list, but i think youd be hardpressed to find a more thoughtful and transaprent (in terms of assumptions made) list of the best players in the NBA.   I think Holiday (Tier 3A) and Conley (Tier 3B) are too high -- especially Holiday. We're like two all-time Giannis games away from calling him Jrue Bledsoe for the rest of his career, but alas it's not that big a deal"
i mean that's still a ridiculous thing to say. NO ONE jrue-sized guards like jrue. lower center of gravity isn't some magical quality that allows small guards to defend bigger ppl. jrue holiday is what allows jrue holiday to guard ppl so well. he's hella strong and his technique is genius. every single other guard in the NBA has a lower center of gravity and none of them can do this.
"I was at the game.  Josh Christopher is playing like a man on fire, as good as Sengun was tonight, Josh was on the same level.  His shot selection in the first game was atrocious especially in the beginning, but he is making plays on offense and defense.  I don’t know who he thinks he is, but he’s upset with EVERYONE that he’s being called a throwaway pick.    His handle looks smooth, and he was distributing the ball better than any tape I’ve seen.  Dude is going to be trouble.  Locking down Cade like he was Jrue Holiday."
I wasn't aware there were any good defensive stats. Can you please explain why Steph Curry has a higher DWS than Jrue Holiday?
"I think after watching what Jrue Holiday did in the finals those last four games, a lot of people probably respect what a great on-ball defender can do at the point of attack for a team. Mitchell has that same mindset on defense. He'll carve out a long career even if he never becomes an all star."
Kind of like a Jrue Holiday if he develops really well
Jrue thickums holiday
"There’s a video of Jrue Holiday recovering and blocking a shot that has to be seen to believed. Like he was *BEAT* off the dribble, soundly and does some superhuman shit. I consider myself to be pretty athletic and we’re the same size. No way I could’ve gotten to that.   https://youtu.be/icBYTc0ty6A"
Jrue Holiday - in the post defensively   Zinger - in the post offensively
"His ceiling to me is Jrue Holiday, who is an all-star point guard. His floor is a better Pat Bev"
Jrue holiday and porzingis
"&gt;The wild card is health, which is stressful given their shortened bench and AD's history  AD's ""history"" is really overblown. He had a bunch of knick knack injuries early in his career, but that was back when the Pelicans were using the medical and training staff from the Saints rather than a dedicated basketball staff. Back then virtually everyone on those Pelicans teams was always hurt, not just AD. Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, etc were regularly missing half the year with injuries due to the Benson family being too cheap to hire trainers that specialized in basketball players.   AD got hurt this year, but it was his first real injury in five seasons, and it came after the shortest off-season in pro sports history. AD never had a chance to recover from the bubble run and get ready for this past season as the Lakers only got 6 weeks off. He probably should have just sat out the first two months, but the league needed him to be there for their opening night game against the Clippers and the Xmas day game against Dallas, so that really wasn't an option. And I don't need to tell a Jazz fan this, but basically everyone got hurt this year, it wasn't just AD. I'm comfortable thinking last year was an anomaly rather than what we should expect going forward.   As for the Lakers depth, they're not at all thin on the bench like you're saying, but rather have many, many options there. A lot of their players are older, but they're all rotation caliber guys who can be counted on to play 20ish minutes per game if needed. I wouldn't be surprised if the Lakers lean on their depth along with their top end talent to let both LeBron and Westbrook rest a lot this year. I could see the Lakers spacing their minutes out so those two don't share the floor much, and so each player maybe only plays 30 mpg. The rest of the guards (Monk, Nunn, Bazemore, Ellington) should be able to fill in the remaining 66 guard minutes, while Melo and Ariza can fill in for the bench forward minutes. Dwight and Gasol can probably play 30ish center minutes combined between them. I think the Lakers regular season rotation is going to be just fine."
Thats a better resume than Jrue Holiday yet people on the Olympic thread were calling Jrue a Hall Of Famer
"Jrue Holiday did a great job defending him, I'm not worrying. I don't think he is going to play with big 3 at playoffs because of his defense. At least Lakers didn't get him."
Huh?? Of course a rooks with a couple summer league games isn’t going to look like a top 5 all time pg.  weird comparison to make IMO.  Think Smart or even jrue holiday might be slightly better comps
"That's going to become a thing of the past pretty soon. If this free agency has taught us anything (and also 2019 with KD to the Nets and ESPECIALLY Jimmy to the Heat) it's that sign-and-trades are the name of the game now, and anyone can basically create cap space to aquire talent if there's mutual interest. Moreover in the age of everything from players to picks to cap space being an ""asset"" (and GMs who may not be in line for championship at least looking to ""stockpile assets"" just in case it becomes their turn to trade for a disgruntled star or absorb some salary in a sign-and-trade) you'll be able to find 2, 3, even 4 teams willing to jump in to make a convoluted deal happen. Look at the Harden trade, look at the Jrue Holiday/Bledsoe/Steven Adams deal. The Russ/Dinwiddie/Etc monstrosity is only the latest. We're kind of in a weird new era where the GMs have caught up to player empowerment, and it's gonna be easier than ever to dump ""bad"" contracts and get the talent you want no matter how over the cap you are. There's no such thing as an ""untradeable"" contract anymore, so long as you can attach ""assets"" or get other teams involved. Wall, Wiggins, Russ, CP3; they've all been traded, and it wouldnt be surprising to see them get moved again."
"Bruh you can literally watch Davion defending against Cade Cunningham already. He knows how to stay connected to and disrupt shooters. We just watched Jrue Holiday shut down Devin Booker on the biggest stage. Davion's height is a disadvantage but not a disqualification. You can't not draft an elite perimeter defender because he ""might struggle against Kawhi or KD"""
What are the odds lu dort is the next jrue holiday
I thought Tatum with his size and athletic ability would be a better defender with his long arms but he’s a cone on defense. People just go right around him. I don’t understand why he isn’t like Giannis or AD. Hell even Ben Simmons. He’s close to their height with similar athleticism. Defense is really all heart and effort because some guys have all the tools to be great on that end and other guys who aren’t the tallest but  fully commit are great like Jrue Holiday at 6’3.
Dude is going to be Jrue Holiday 2.0.
Keep Jrue Holiday
"That doesn't take away from what I said at all. You don't think CP3 would be even better if he was 6'6 instead of 6ft? You don't think if he's getting defended by Jrue Holiday, he'd have an easier time seeing over him with an extra 6 inches?"
"LA: Westbrook, Harden, Paul Pierce, Kawhi, Kevin Love. Jrue Holiday, PG, Brook Lopez, Tyson Chandler, Baron Davis, Reggie Miller, Klay, Gilbert Arenas off the bench"
"No. He would have to be elected to many more all stars (5+ IMO) and a few all-nba teams to even be considered. Ben Wallace is a 4x DPOY, multiple time all star and all-nba player, nba champion, and still had to wait quite a bit to make the HOF.  A DPOY for Jrue Holiday won't change much."
"If Jrue Holiday somehow wins a DPOY, you think he has a chance?"
"So have you just never heard of Jrue Holiday before round 2 of the playoffs then? His offense is generally pretty damn good, career numbers fully back that up.    If anything this postseason was an anomaly compared to a nearly decade-long career. Look up the numbers for yourself, or watch his last series with the Pelicans where he clamped Lilliard and outscored him at the same time. The information is all out there for you, stop pretending that poor shooting is the norm for him"
He dropped 50 and 10 on Jrue Holiday lmao this so disrespectful for no reason.
"I doubt even that would get it done. Obviously at this point Halliburton is a better prospect than Wiseman. But if the rumours are to be believed the Raps turned down a package of two lottery picks, Wiseman, and salary filler for Siakam. Which is insanely good value for his caliber of player. Raptors are probably looking for a massive overpay ALA Jrue Holiday (though obviously that worked out for the Bucks)"
It’s not talked about enough just how putrid Jrue Holiday was on the offensive end last postseason. I get that his defence was great and winning cures all but a 48.2 TS% is legit Markelle Fultz numbers.
Go ahead and grab Jrue and Justin Holiday while you're at it
Yeah if AD had someone like Jrue Holiday
It worked for Jrue Holiday so why not?
Well KPJ scored 50 against Jrue Holiday.... let’s see how Green does in an actual game.
Jrue Holiday
Think he just wasn’t built around properly like his help was Jrue Holiday or like half a year of Cousins
"I 2nd the Kawhi vote. I think that guy is a fit in any era.  That said, Jrue Holiday had an all-time insane play-off run defending the perimeter this year: Trae, Booker, CP3, KD, Kyrie, Harden, etc. and was in my opinion the biggest difference maker between this Bucks' team and last year's.  Imagine if you gave these two the more physical defense hand check rules of the 90s. Some players would be absolutely finished once they put their hands on them because of their strength, lateral speed, quickness and overall feel."
"Jrue Holiday locked down Booker for the most part in the finals. Granted, Booker isn't on the same level as KD but he was being talked up as a star of the league. Even by KD if I recall right."
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good. My favourite ""firm"" that operate in this particular sector of the game is ""The Ball Index"" ([twitter](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index)). They posted their own Three All-Defensive Teams ausing the G/G/F/F/C format and . I would like to bring them here!

"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
"I mean the Jrue Holiday trade seems very controversial on here at the time (though partly because it was reported as 5 FRPs which it really wasn’t).  People saw it as a good move but not enough.  And obviously we got lucky with the Nets series, but if we hadn’t traded for him, we lose that series.  That trade not only helped us keep Giannis but we won a title."
Gobert as the big man.  KD and Jokic as the forwards.  Patty Mills and Jrue Holiday as the guards.
who is better than jrue holiday on the sixers?
Giannis won DPOY and got embarrassed by the Heat. added Jrue Holiday and win a title. what position does Jrue defend? lol
"No he ain’t. He’s wildly overrated and inconsistent in the playoffs. Remember that he got swept by the AD Pelicans with just Jrue Holiday and a past his prime Rondo. The only arguments people have for Dame in the playoffs are “buzzer beaters”. Other than that, he ain’t anything special as a first option in the playoffs"
Who is second??? Cause I know you’re saying Jrue Holiday performed better lmfao
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De’Aaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I’d rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D’Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"So the only dimensions are offence and defence? Both sides have equal value ? Shooting, slashing, playmaking and all of those majorly important and impactful parts of offence all translate into one dimension that’s worth just as much as defence ? By your logic again, half the stars in the league are one dimensional. Harden Kyrie Steph Beal Mitchell Booker dame towns Jokic etc. Is Ben better than all them ? Hell why isn’t jrue holiday #6?"
"Steph, Dame, Kyrie, CP3, Russ, Ja, Jamal Murray, Jrue Holiday, Luka, Trae, Lowry, Conley. Not in that order but they are above Ben Simmons. So probably 13-14. It’s a tossup between him and Fox since both of them have non-existent playoff performances anyway. In the RS, Ben has Fox beat in everything except points. So probably Ben but by a tiny margin."
"I think this is more commonly taught now, in the NBA at least. Jrue Holiday has basically perfected it."
"The Pelicans had a partnership with the Ochsner hospital - the largest hospital in the gulf south usa. Ochsner has an entire sports medicine wing, the doctors and training staff there cover high school, college, and pro games. Their staff cover the Saints yea, but they aren’t “football staff.”   The training staff isn’t the reason Ryan Anderson had a freak neck injury because someone on the nets ran into him.   The training staff isn’t the reason Jrue Holiday couldn’t stay healthy (the 76ers played him while injured and hid it from the Pelicans in the trade. They were sued and lost in court BTW and had to pay damages to the Nola owner and the league has since changed rules regarding the transfer of medical records). They also aren’t the reason he missed over half a season because his wife had a brain tumor.  The training staff wasn’t the reason AD kept getting little injuries (just look at his time with the Lakers, nothing has changed).  The training staff isn’t why Eric Gordon refused to rehab his knee.   I’m tired of this take making the rounds."
I guess Jrue Holiday is better than Kyrie then
"Assuming this is ""guards that didn't make the All star team last season but are really good"" (MPJ makes no sense of course), let's put Jrue Holiday in for MPJ.  1. Young 2. Fox 3. Holiday 4. Murray 5. SGA 6. Ja 7. LaMelo  Though LaMelo isn't that far away.  And if you add Colin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon and Derrick White, I still have LaMelo at 7."
"The list:  1). Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  2). Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  3). LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4). Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  5). Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets  6). Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  7). Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  8). James Harden, Brooklyn Nets  9). Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers  10). Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers  11). Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat  12). Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  13). Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns  14). Chris Paul, Phoenix Suns  15). Paul George, LA Clippers  16). Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets  17). Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  18). Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz  19). Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards  20t). Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat  20t). Zion Williamson, New Orleans Pelicans  22). Khris Middleton, Milwaukee Bucks  23). Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz	  24). Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics  25). Jrue Holiday, Milwaukee Bucks  26). Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves  27). Russell Westbrook, Los Angeles Lakers  28). Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies  29). Julius Randle, New York Knicks  30). Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers"
"But GSW would still have room in cap space so they would probably sign someone else, i mean not as good as KD but Jrue Holiday, Hayward, Ibaka, Gallo, Cp3, Blake Griffin... Were all free"
"Yup and I was one of them making fun of booker, that’s how I know people don’t hate booker and it’s just a suns fan being defensive. Anytime I posted anything anti booker I got downvoted lol.  People were way more concerned with CP’s bad performances, jrue holiday shooting 4-94 and Giannis being insane. I feel like people are kinda indifferent on booker, he’s a great player but kinda annoying, I don’t think many people care much either way."
"No im not ben simmons doesn’t move the needle for Portland. What’s he going to do, lock up Jokic? Guard Steph Curry? Cj is needed for them to beat the Warriors and Nuggets and Clippers and Lakers. Simmons is a liability on offense and he’s not a lockdown defender. I’d rather have jrue holiday"
I thought it was Jrue Holiday?
Jrue Holiday literally put the clamps on 2 All-NBA caliber guards in the Finals this very playoffs mate.
"""Jrue and Lauren Holiday ..."" in a headline is the opposite of seeing a troubled athlete's name and wondering what poor choice did they make now.   When you see Jrue and Lauren you expect something awesome."
"It was not a half decade. Actually, in the last decade, the sixers only had a 5 year playoff drought compared to the Lakers’ 6.  Hinkie resided over 3 seasons, roughly. Three. His starting assets were: Jrue Holiday, Spencer Hawes, Evan Turner, Thad Young. Missing future firsts that the previous regimes had thrown away, too.  They win 19, 18, and 10 games respectively - only the worst team in the league once during that time. Hinkie gets shoved out the door, Big Collar Colangelo comes in, Embiid debuts (in a season in which they lose true rookie Ben Simmons due to a freak foot injury - thanks Shawn Long!), losing years effectively over. 3. Whole. Seasons. In which we discovered gems like Richaun Holmes, TJ, Jerami Grant, Covington, etc."
"Lol k, simple Reddit search and...  &gt;[\[Charania\] Team USA's 12-man roster for the Tokyo Olympics: Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Zach LaVine, Kevin Love, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Jerami Grant](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o6jsxw/charania_team_usas_12man_roster_for_the_tokyo/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)  Oh, there's an announcement of the roster... is Love's name...

Jrue Holiday rules and you can tell him i said that
"Jrue Holiday is a pretty amazing guy.  His wife is also more badass than him, which is also cool."
"Well yea. Defense is a team thing. Stats for it are unreliable. Its hard to judge individually, especially since the actual game impact of your defense might not be felt. Jrue Holiday is a better defender than Eric Bledsoe, always has been, but Bledsoe made all defense over him multiple times because he was on a great team and Jrue not so much."
"Ben Simmons can’t shoot for shit pardon my French.  Magic had a 30.3% 3PT shot while Ben only has a 14.7%.  It’s a worlds of difference, especially when you factor in that 3 pointers are a much bigger part of the game now-a days.  I’m not super knowledgeable about the NBA, now or in Magic’s time. But someone that really comes to mind is Jrue Holiday, he plays good D, can shoot similar to Magic’s %, and is good at assisting. Obviously, the guys not in Magic’s tier but they’re similar IMO.  The only thing that really stands out to me when comparing similarities between Ben and Magic is the height as a guard."
"We really drafted Michael Jordan and Nikola Jokic, Draymond Green and Jrue Holiday in one draft"
"&gt;Bucks had a slightly better record vs the west than Mavs did.  Of course, they don't play the same teams.  If you compare the regular season schedule of the average western team to the average eastern team its laughable.    &gt;They were also a clearly better defensive team who could put Giannis, Jrue, Tucker on KD for multiple posessions with Kyrie and Harden playing injured... He was the focal point of the defense.  Irving played the first 4 games &amp; Harden was still demanding defensive attention when injured.  PJ Tucker &amp; Holiday are midgets, Kawhi has eaten these dudes alive in the past.    Who did KD have to guard?    &amp; the Clippers almost beating the Suns showed how good they were, they beat the #1 seed."
"maybe it has more to do with era, but AD could never lead a team anywhere in the playoffs.  the best he's done as the lead guy is an 8-seed first round exit, and a 6-seed where he lost in the second round.  KG led the Timberwolves to the playoffs each of his first 8 seasons in the league.  behind his MVP campaign, he led them to the #1 seed and the conference finals (where he lost in 6 games to Shaq/Kobe).  and it's not like he ever had a very good supporting cast, I would argue Jrue Holiday was a better #2 than anyone KG ever played with in Minnesota.  and the Western conference was just as great when KG played as when AD played.  so these are all impressive accomplishments KG has that AD has never even sniffed.  also AD is amazing but he's definitely way way softer than KG.  he's not as comfortable banging down low and is pretty injury-prone.  KG was an absolute iron man before his ACL tear.  so sure, in a vacuum when they are both at their peak and completely healthy, it might be close.  but AD is often not playing at his healthy peak."
"Jrue holiday I definitely agree with. One game he was poppin, next he couldn't do much offensively"
Klay Thompson (more so can get hot than both hot and cold) and Jrue holiday offensively this year was that way.
I feel like the jrue holiday trade was a pretty big trade too.
"They also dont want to come to Milwaukee, but they managed to get Jrue Holiday and develop Middleton."
"&gt; I'm sure you said the same shit about the Suns and Bucks this year.  No I didn't, because those are two squads that actually had the balls to make big trades.  Bucks gave up approximately 9 zillion picks for Jrue Holiday and then paid him the GDP of a small island.  And it worked. But you guys won't trade Dame or Nurkic because they're Dame's friends and Dame wants to win with his guys.  You guys stick with the same core guys all the time, switch out role players, and then wonder what went wrong at the end of the season.  That's a team that needs a big move.  But they won't make one because they don't want to make Dame upset when his friends are included."
"&gt;  He's a fantastic on ball  This is taking it too far, he's a good on ball defender who's best asset is probably in the post, he's not at some Jrue Holiday level or anything.  The off ball defense stuff is all considerably more important, if you're going to be a space cadet off ball it's a big problem. He hasnt been a net positive defender on the Celtics for multiple yrs now. Just ask Spoelstra or Nick Nurse they gameplanned to attack his off ball defense in the playoffs."
"Do you think Giannis will re-sign with the Bucks again in 5 years? He's way younger than the rest of the roster, Middleton is 30, Jrue is 31, Brook Lopez is 33... And the Bucks traded a lot of picks to get Jrue Holiday and they aren't exactly a big FA destination.  Giannis seems to be the kind of guy that is loyal to a franchise, but at the same time Bucks probabily won't be good enough to contend in the last years of his prime."
I’m actually really confused as to what you’re trying to say. I don’t think any calls Steph a good defender by any means but he’s not definitely not a bad defender like many people think. He’s got great fundamentals with the occasional reach in that will sometimes result in steals. No one is arguing that he is Jrue holiday. I would really like to know who’s saying that curry is great at defense. As for Durant he has just never had the reputation of being a good defender and it wasn’t until Golden state when he showed his impact. I also want to point that some of these awards are granted by the media and some are by players/coaches.
"After watching Jrue absolutely harass CP3 and Booker in the finals, it's hard not to respect the hell out of the man's defense. There were so many plays in that series where his on-ball defense really limited the Suns' offensive options.   You can hold whatever opinion you want, but Holiday was so integral to the Bucks defense in the finals that I think he deserves respect for his impact defensively. His defense directly caused so many turnovers even though he didn't get steals himself. It was fun to watch."
"He is actually right around average in defense, check his drtg and dbpm. If you watch him play, he ain’t no Kawhi Leonard but he’s no Trae Young either. He has a quick first step, way above average height for his position so he can flexibly defend 1-3 and have the height advantage, and he has excellent mobility for his size. He does have issues with defensive effort, doesn’t put in 100% every possession and he doesn’t treat every person he defends with the same attention. He clearly doesn’t do any of that Jrue Holiday, Draymond Green shit where they study tape and specifically practice how to guard each all-star level player on the opposing team. His cardio isn’t elite enough to have that much offensive load while also putting max effort into defense.   But by all metrics I’ve seen, he’s right about there, some show slightly below or slightly above, but he’s not a turnstile on defense. His average defense is actually why he’s just so much better than Trae, because while Trae is an offensive weapon, he’s a massive liability on defense. To the point where he’d be specifically targeted every other possession for the switch, and he’s just not athletic enough or tall enough for even many PGs, 2s and 3s will straight up ignore him and shoot over him. People used to criticize Steph for his lack of defense but he’s actually league average most seasons too, he just got targeted since he used to be the weakest defender out of the starting lineup. And people would see that and critique him for getting shitted on by LeBron or Kyrie."
"I really have to disagree - and I guess it's more to do with the term ""champion level PG"" than your comment in particular. The starting PGs since 2010 of NBA Champions are:  * Jrue Holiday * Alex Caruso * Kyle Lowry * Steph Curry (x2) * Kyrie Irving * Tony Parker * Mario Chalmers (x2) * Derek Fisher * Jason Kidd   This list goes to show ""champion level PGs"" vary wildly. Also shows that if Ben Simmons had a jumpshot and replaced the PGs in the list, he would've been an NBA Champion more often than not."
"Definitely. There are only a few sets of brothers trios to play in the NBA to start with. I can only think of:  * Will, Caldwell, Major and Charles Jones * Frank, Campy and Walker Russell * Jon, Brent and Drew Barry * Luke, Tyler and Cody Zeller * Jrue, Justin and Aaron Holiday * Giannis, Thanasis, and Kostas Antetokounmpo"
I thought this for a long time until I heard JJ Redick talk about Jrue Holiday and it changed my world.
I'd say Jrue Holiday
Yeah. I didn’t understand this ban either. Myles Turner and Jrue Holiday really rocked them well. There’s no reasonable except then NBA don’t like the look.   Either that or they think it’s a slippery slope to other things players intend to wear.
&gt;he just got to play with arguably the best player he’s ever played with in Jrue Holiday  Are you on crack? Kris Middleton literally made all star teams while Jrue has 0.   &gt;If Giannis had Rich Paul as his agent he probably would’ve left Milwaukee years ago.  Give me one Klutch player that has forced a move that isn't named Anthony Davis.  &gt;AD couldn’t get the job done so he gets a free pass to LA to play with one of the GOATs?  Yeah fuck him for not winning a championship with Jrue Holiday and the 2018 version of Julius Randle.
"How many years has Giannis been on the Bucks and he just got to play with arguably the best player he’s ever played with in Jrue Holiday, and they won! everyone got to experience Giannis get a ring with the Bucks which was awesome. If Giannis had Rich Paul as his agent he probably would’ve left Milwaukee years ago. AD couldn’t get the job done so he gets a free pass to LA to play with one of the GOATs?"
"That 18/19 Pels team’s second best player was Jrue Holiday. The third best was Mirotic.   7 years with AD, Holiday was the best teammate they could get him in that time. They had Boogie right before he broke down, too. Bonus points, I suppose.   They traded draft picks for players who didn’t help. Missed drafting Hield over Jamal Murray for example.   These guys do have agency over where they go. They are the product, not the old white guy cutting checks. They can orchestrate their destination via free agency or trade. At least in a trade, they’re letting their old team get something for their departure.  Unless you’re Ben Simmons and you’re now worth less than a Tyrese Halliburton."
"In the game Kyrie that went down at the end of the first half, the Bucks won and tied the series at 2-2. That was with Jrue Holiday playing super ass and Khris Middleton playing pretty terrible for the most part as well outside of one game (which they won). The fact of the matter is that the series was tied going into game 5 when KD finally had neither Kyrie or Harden even though the Bucks were not even playing close to their best basketball. It wasn’t like the Nets were playing great defense or anything either, the Bucks were just missing open looks. I think it’s too short-sighted to say the Nets would beat the Bucks easily even without Kyrie."
Jrue Holiday
"Brand definitely owns the Simmons contract, no doubt. The GM circus in Philly is also partially to blame since no one was there long enough to act on all the data about Embiid and Simmons being a bad fit in time to sell high on Simmons. The ""experiment"" phase has been over for a couple years now with it being clear that Ben clogs the paint and limits Embiid's offense more than a standard guard would have. Had the GM situation been stable enough, perhaps the Sixers are able to get Jrue Holiday away from the Pelicans last year?   Still, Morey owns unique blame as well. He was new to the job and decided to run it back, but in retrospect he missed the window to sell high at the trade deadline and it bit him in the ass. His mentality of refusing to trade unless he's fleecing someone was a problem then and now it has exacerbated the current schism because each outlandish trade request has further humiliated Simmons by dragging this situation out longer than necessary.   Not enough has been said to know exactly what went down during the Harden negotiations. It's safe to assume that the Rockets would've made Morey overpay. Rumors were that he balked at a package including Simmons+Maxey+Thybulle. In retrospect, he should have overpaid and lost the trade for a player of Harden's caliber who is clearly an ideal fit next to Embiid. I say this not just out of hindsight but also because it was known at the time that the other contenders for Harden--Brooklyn and Miami--were both in Philly's conference. By not going all-in, Philly allowed the Brooklyn superteam to form, which makes a title run during Embiid's prime pretty unlikely."
Jrue Holiday
"Giannis Overrated  Since one of yo giannis fanboys want to delete my post I’m gonna repost it.  Giannis has no skill whatsoever  - He can’t dribble   - He can’t Shoot  - He has no IQ (decides to take a fadeaway on JAMES HARDEN)  -Overrated defense he’s regarded as an all nba 1st team defender yet was scared to guard kd and he has no permitter defense average at best he only has decent post defense   -He’s not clutch every time the game is on the line guess who gets the ball not Giannis MIDDLETON because giannis is not to trust in the clutch  Now let me get on with this overrated ring he got.  -the whole western conference was injured they played the worst team   -would of lost to the nets   -claims he doesn’t have a super team(great team) yet bucks beat hawks without him   - kd by himself took them to 7 games   - choked last year, only reason there doing so good this year is because injuries and the addition of jrue holiday was major to there success   - jrue holiday and Middleton don’t get enough credit the media acts as if giannis carried them, if giannis is not showing up Middleton drops 30 and they jrue holiday to lock up the other team guard like he did with booker  - all the times dropped over 35 he averages 17 free throw attempts   - he was dropping big numbers on one of the worst defensive team in the suns which is why against the heat he only averaged 24 against the heat  -he averages over than half the amount of the suns highest ft player with 85 attempts   -the idea over the casuals is that the bucks team wasn’t good and Giannis carried them they have jrue holiday, Middleton, brook lopez who saved them with the block on kd, and they got Bobby portis nowhere near a bad team actually a great team  -lost 2 games to a overrated suns team   - both his mvp he got were undeserved harden should of got it then Lebron   -Giannis also averaging the most free throw attempts in a series since Dwade in the 2006 FINALS.    Stop being bias and look at the facts when you put it into context you see how unimpressive it looks."
Jrue Holiday is also an All Star and I have no recollection of Hill being a Knick 😔
A lot of players and especially guards rely on their quick first step. Luka is super crafty.  I will never forget this [play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieJNazQE71o) against Jrue Holiday
MVP: Paul George MIP: Tyrese Haliburton 6MOY: Jordan Clarkson ROY: Cade Cunningham  DPOY: Jrue Holiday
"im not a philly fan mate, i think they’re a bum organisation with bum fans.  I dont care about whats expected of the non number 1 options, this whole thread is basically about media slander.  Ben Simmons in sixers vs hawks game 7, Awful.  Jrue Holiday in bucks vs nets game 7, Awful.  Kyle Lowry in sixers vs raptors game 7, Awful.  Theres only one reason that only one of these games has been talked about literally every day on this subreddit since it happened and the other 2 performances went under the radar, and that’s because only one of them lost"
"It was evident as a role player's tool. Steve Kerr and John Paxon were on his team shooting 3s, Jordan didn't have to do it.  The ""elite"" 3 points shooters of the era like Reggie Miller shot 4 of them per game. FOUR. Do you know where that would put the greatest 3 point shooter of the 90s? Somewhere between PJ Washington and Jrue Holiday.  The league was built around shooting high FG% not high eFG% or TS%. The goal was entirely different.  So I'm accusing you of being obtuse."
I need to see defense at least some.  Offensive stats are nice but that’s depends.  Is one harden level or Jrue holiday level.   Lol
Jrue Holiday because amongst NBA players he has always been respected.  Also he has never underperformed even though he has been moved to different teams.  So his legacy winning a championship is huge.
"I don't know.  But I hope Rich Paul is smart enough to maximize the marketing potential of 3 of his properties (Lavine, Simmons, Maxey) by having them join forces with Joel Embiid.    Jrue Holiday was in the same position, and his agent got him to Milwaukee to play with Giannis.  Worst outcome for Klutch Sports is Ben Simmons traded to small market Minnesota,  Lavine stays in 6th-9th seed Chicago, with Maxey trying to carry hollowed out Philly.  May seem far fetched, but give me the scenario where Klutch Sports makes out better?"
"If Westbrook is healthy hes a walking 20/10/10 with super high energy.  Hes also an above average defender. Jrue is a great defender but u don't know what ur getting from him offensively on a day to day basis.   Westbrook is def better than holiday its not even a question lmaoo  Westbrook may have weakness but basketball is a team game. Just like jrue had giannis to score 40 pts every game and play defense, Westbrook has lebron and Anthony davis and a bunch of shooters.   Lakers really got the last 2 assist leaders surrounded with all elite shooters. Not to mention the lob threat of ad lebron and Howard, even Jordan now as an end of the bench guy just incase."
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
"Is that an advanced metric? According to that logic, Jrue holiday, Rudy Gobert, and Ben Simmons are all shitty defenders as well. You might be mentally challenged my guy. 9 year olds know nothing about ball these days LMAO"
"So many players get forgotten. Look at random all star rosters from the 90s and each one has a guy or two that makes you go ""oh yeah, that guy was pretty good, forgot about him"".    So like, Mike Conley will be forgotten by non-memphis fans. Jrue Holiday will probably be forgotten. Even someone as good as Beal, if he never moves teams, nobody outside the DMV will have any idea who he was in like 2046."
"Charles Barkley is just like any other oldhead. They’re presenting him with facts and he’s just saying no because it’s different from when he played. The fact is Embiid is more skilled than Shaq but Shaq was more physically dominant. Shaq wants every Center to avg 30+ &amp; 15 or they’re a “Bum” in his mind. Embiid has to shoot a couple of threes per game for spacing because his “PG” won’t even shoot a midrange jumper let alone 3s. Three 3pointers per game while shooting 37% is good for a center in the modern era. He’s not shooting too much Ben isn’t shooting enough! If Embiid played with any all star caliber PG like a healthy D’Angelo Russel, Jrue Holiday, CP3, or any other nice PGs who weren’t afraid to shoot he could play the post more. Ben’s defenders double him because they know Ben won’t shoot. He ruins the floor spacing for Embiid and everyone else."
"&gt; Lastly, professional oddsmakers are giving the team +400 odds to win the championship, imputing a 20% chance. If you're going to call a team with 20% chance of winning the chip at the beginning of the season a ""superteam,"" then there are several superteams every single season.  Yes, it's just that the Nets are a better superteam.  &gt; A. Davis: as the best player on his team before joining LeBron, his squad made the playoffs only fucking twice in 7 seasons, R1 and R2 exits, none of which can be blamed on major injury loss. His first Lakers season, the team was 6-2 without him.  You can give **some** context to his Pels run though. His 2 best teammates during much of his tenure was Eric Gordon who didn't want to be there and missed around 30 to 40 games every year. Then he had Jrue Holiday who had serious injury issues and missed a bunch of time because of his wife's illness. Never had 1 even decent wing in the team, they sign stupid contracts all the time and even had their brand new center, Asik, got Chron's disease.   The Pels before 2018 where run by the same FO as the football team and where an after thought. Worst runned team in the league. When they got their shit together, Cousins goes down with a career altering injury. MVP level CP3 won only 1 playoffs series thanks to the same organization.  This was the starting lineup with whom AD played in 2015 playoffs against the Warriors:  Quincy Pondexter - Eric Gordon - Tyreke Evans - AD - Asik  He has been a All-NBA 1st team in 4 out of the last 5 seasons before 2021 when he was injured, has finished top 3 and 5 in MVP voting before and has an All-Time great postseason with the Lakers in 2020 before getting fucked by the short rest for 2021.  Completely sad that I have to even defend AD to a Lakers fan, WTF. Kind of done with this combo if you don't even respect your players and want to underestimate them like that."
"Having Facu Campazzo, Monte Morris, and Austin Rivers as the first line of defense and Jokic as the second line is not going to go far in the playoffs. With Jokic, we really need to surround him with talented defenders to stay afloat against the best. Obviously, he is a powerhouse on offense who gets the team there in the first place. The Nuggets really need a Jrue Holiday and OG Anunoby type at guard, if they want to survive a CP3 pnr."
"And was guarded by on Jrue Holiday, well, in some possessions, but still impressive"
"Would you rather vote for Ben Simmons or Jrue Holiday if you had a choice next year as a coach?  My guess is neither makes it, but they have the same pros and cons, but one guy actually helped his team when it mattered and one didn’t."
You ignored how good of a screen navigator he is. He doesn’t blown them up and steal/stop them like Jrue Holiday or anything he more shades them into help. The fact that there are guards that play man to man defense as good or worse than Steph yet have worse off ball defensive awareness is what makes Steph be average for his position. You just care about man to man defense more when Steph isn’t horrible at it he just isn’t good at it he’s ok.   He’s bad if he’s at an island in a good iso possession but you ignore the other way offenses operate on ball. He’s a good team defender if there’s an unwise decision the dribbler makes he stops or shades them to help.   I think you’re overrating how good other point guards are on defense.
"The Pelicans got a great return for both AD and Jrue Holiday when they traded them, but it's just reality that they've already squandered a big portion of what they got, and it started almost immediately. The Lakers gave them the 4th pick in the 2019 draft, which they could have used on DeAndre Hunter or Darius Garland, but instead they traded it for Jaxon Hayes and NAW. They've now let Lonzo go with an extremely questionable return, and they traded away another first round pick they got from the Lakers to unload Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe. This was after wasting picks and other assets to get Steven Adams in the first place, of course. They're a poorly run team so it's no wonder their star players always want out."
"That analogy is completely way out there. AD wanted out of New Orleans because they were wasting his prime years. He gave them heads up of where he wanted to go and where he didn’t want to go. He wanted to play ball for the Pelicans but the Pelicans insisted on benching him so he didn’t get injured and tank his trade value. Pels trade AD to the Lakers, they get a great return. They now make dumb moves like trading away Jrue Holiday, acquiring Eric Bledsoe or sign Steven Adams for a long term contract, or fail to re-sign Lonzo. Now Zion isn’t pleased and we’re close to square one,"
&gt;Jrue Holiday isn't the difference between winning or losing a championship.  Why do you say this when he was one of the difference makers this year for the bucks.
"This sub overrates 3 and d players pretty hard because the archetype fits the nba meta. So for this sub I’d say oj, lonzo, jrue holiday, Covington are all pretty overrated in terms of impact - they’re decent roleplayers but they arent the difference between winning or losing a championship."
I still have my 2 Jrue Holiday jerseys on ice in case he ever returns lol
"Dear Dumbass,  Brook's iniital Bucks contract was minimum wage.  And the coward Ben Simmons direct equivalent is Jrue Holiday, who we did back the truck up for."
"I did watch the Finals. I also watched regular season and playoff games too, which is a larger sample size.  He had plenty of good defensive possessions in the Finals, by the way. The only reason he’s on the wrong end of some Jrue Holiday highlights is because he held Jrue to some terrible numbers for three quarters and then clear got worn out and Holiday took advantage. It’s why him and Middleton had so many good fourth quarters after having terrible first halves."
"Or even just a stat.   Like Isaiah Thomas being ""the worst defender in the NBA"" literally came from a single Reddit post citing he was dead last in specifically DRPM at specifically one point midway through the season [\(Russell Westbrook actually finished dead last for the full season\)](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2017/page/12/sort/DRPM).   [The season before he had tied with Jrue Holiday.](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2016/page/7/sort/DRPM)  This entire sub turned on a dime when that post came out and suddenly everyone was saying ""you just have to watch him to know it's true"" and ""he's too short to actually have any impact"".     [It got to the point where Nate Duncan was coming out to dismiss the rumour.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/626vxf/isaiah_thomas_is_not_the_worst_defender_in_the_nba/)  He was never a great defender, he was never even really a good defender. However, he was never as horrible as people suddenly decided he was. He was bad in the way other star PGs were bad (Har_en, Westbrook, Lillard and Kyrie).  He also wasn't really holding our defence back in a major way. We had a top 7 defence for more of Isaiah's tenure than not."
steph does it well compared to who? jrue holiday? seth curry and dame?
"Because maybe some players are good defenders if they try?   People don't realize that no player can drop 30 points and play amazing defense (Giannis is the expection). Team defense is much more important. Jrue Holiday was amazing on defense this playoffs, but he was complete ass on offense, Kawhi was amazing on offense, but didn't give his all on defense(DPOY level).   Rudy was the DPOY and got outplayed by Terrance Man,  The Sixers had 2 top 5 DPOY candidates and 3 all defensive team members and they got cooked by lou williams  it's stupid to ask every star player that's the main offensive point of the team to play hard on defense, I'm sure booker, luka and harden could chase guys around screens and hustle more, but is it worth it if they get gassed on offense then?"
the raptors alternative was win a chip with Kawhi. Our alternative was a Jrue Holiday/Evan Turner/Thad young core.
"Yeah, as a Kings fan I agree. 76ers can already play 5-out with 38%+ 3pt shooters: Curry, Kork, Green, Tobi, Joel. Everybody loves another 3pt shooter, but if they trade Simmons for even more spacing without getting back a PG that can start in the playoffs they will get significantly worse. Imagine Seth Curry trying to drive and kick against Jrue Holiday.   The Buddy to the 76ers rumors started when Simmons was still presumed to be a part of their core. In a vacuum Philly would love to add him for spare parts and late 1sts, but if they send Simmons out, they need Fox, Haliburton, or a 3rd team's starting-caliber PG to come back."
Jrue Holiday. Who would be really good on this team
Nerlens Noel? It was a draft day trade that saw Jrue Holiday going to the Pelicans.   Hinkie wasn't some savant GM.
"The third best players on the last three title teams are Pascal Siakam, KCP/Rondo, and Jrue Holiday. Ben is definitely better than all those guys  I know his value has fallen off but not *that* much"
"Compete??? Giannis has Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton. That’s a tough team to beat without an equal roster. Durant, Lowry, and Derozan would be an equivalent squad to that."
"A fourth option averaging that is insane kid. I’m sorry but if your fourth option is a mike Conley/jrue holiday level guard you’re stupidly stacked. Why not go through contenders for the past decade and see how many teams you can list where their fourth option is averaging two steals, 8 assist and double digit points. I promise you that list will be very small   No you’re a hater because you’re purposely trying to discredit lebrons competition so you can bash him."
Rondo was averaging 11/8/5 with 2 steals a game and great defense as the fourth best player on the team. That’s like having jrue holiday or mike Conley  as your fourth option lol  This is real rich coming from a hater lol
Salary filler + pick compensation. Something south of the Jrue Holiday bucks trade.
that's the only reason i can think of that the guy hates jrue holiday so much
"bruh wtf is your beef with jrue holiday, by all accounts he is a great player and even better human being.  Before you answer, **HALT**! are you maybe:  **H**ungry  **A**ngry  **L**onely or  **T**ired?  Whenever you feel especially grumpy, one of these four *very common daily problems* could be to blame. Good luck!"
That’s on dell demps being a bad gm. I think he traded away every first round pick every year AD was there besides the one that netted them Buddy Hield. The only W those trades nabbed was Jrue Holiday
"Dude, if you're a shorter defender, you're done for against KD. I saw Jrue Holiday play some of the most fundamentally perfect man to man defense on KD in the Nets and GSW series, only for him to rise up with 3 seconds left on the shot clock and make every single shot over him"
"Was that NBA champion, gold medalist, 1x all-star, 3x all defensive (2x first team), nba teammate of the year, nba sportsmanship award winner, Pac-10 All-Freshman Team, Gatorade National Player of the Year, First-team Parade All-American, Third-team Parade All-American, McDonald's All-American, California Mr. Basketball Jrue Holiday ?"
You'd assume they would be spun off to other teams for win now pieces. Which makes sense in asking for so much. wiggins + 3 firsts even crappy firsts should be able to get a jrue holiday type player.   If they rehab wiseman + picks they get another.
"Even when you say it like that, it’s an absolutely overpay… the bucks got jrue holiday for 3 almost seconds and a horrible Bledsoe contract"
Every big except for Jokic who led his team to a better win percentage without Murray. And you act like AD didn’t have Jrue Holiday for 6 years. AD also only made it to the second round of the playoffs once in 8 years. I didn’t say he was good but it doesn’t matter if you are a big if you can’t carry a team you aren’t worth that much as a first option. Notice how I said first option there’s zero chance the Lakers make that trade if they didn’t already have Lebron to be the number 1 option.
"Definitely well-below average compared to other championship teams.   It's hard to even say who their 3rd best player was. Probably KCP, because he was the only player that could consistently hit 3s. But nobody would have ever predicted KCP would be the third best player of a championship team.  Compare them to this year's championship teams. The third option for each team was Jrue Holiday and Deandre Ayton. Those are both All-Star level players.   That said, the Lakers had ridiculously good chemistry and had a lot of versatility. And the role players all stepped up. That doesn't always happen."
"Hey that team doesn’t make the playoffs without Tyreke, he was a work horse that season. Sucked that Jrue Holiday missed the whole season basically."
I am the only starting point guard that ever put up a TS% higher than my regular season average in a playoff series against a team with Jrue Holiday in the 2010s. (min. 4 games)  &gt;!Was that the series after we beat the DRose-less bulls? I remember him hitting 2 dagger 3s and wondering when he learned to shoot!&lt;
I personally would take Booker. He was dropping 40s in the finals going at it with Giannis but CP3 was in jail from Jrue Holiday. They’re both great scorers but I’d rather have the 6’5 SG over the 6’1-6’2 combo guard. They’re both avg rebounders and playmakers for their height. I think Booker has a higher ceiling than Mitchell because of his size.
"Plenty come to mind, Kawhi and Giannis for sure, even Paul George and Jrue Holiday.  Anthony Davis, Gobert, Bam Adebayo.  Those are just the good defensive players who are also much better offensively.  Soo many more who are average defenders but way better offensively, which helps more in todays NBA.  Draymond does have 3 rings but as stated those are mostly due to Steph, Klay and KD.  We saw how 2019-2020 went without those 3, but with Draymond."
Imagine thinking fucking lamelo ball is currently capable of carrying a team to the playoffs…    This isn’t “20 guys on rookie contracts who are better prospects”. It’s 20 guys who are the best players in the league right now and will win you the most games. Half the fucking list he gave can’t even make the playoffs as the best guy on the team and the other half are 3rd option specialist like jrue holiday. None of those guys are actually better than Westbrook right now.
"Steph, Trae, Kyrie, Dame, CP3, Lowry, Westbrook,  Morant, Fox, Jrue Holiday, Luka, Ben Simmons. I like Lamelo too and I also think he's more than just a supporting piece but top 10? You're tripping."
"Yup. Most of the really good defensive guards have a crazy wingspan. Makes contesting shots and getting deflections that much easier.   Josh Okogie has a 7'0 wingspan, but is only 6'4. Reggie Jackson is 6'3 with a 7'0 wingspan. Jrue Holiday is 6'3 with a 6'7 wingspan. Etc."
"I mean, AD has had LeBron. Not to mention Jrue Holiday, Boogie, Rondo, etc.  And while Giannis does have the team built around him, it’s hard to say Middleton and Holiday 2.0 is a super team or anything. Hell, AD won one playoff series with Jrue."
Rakeem Christmas Jrue Holiday Denzel Valentine
Jrue Holiday - Takes you out on a Holiday and buys you dinner. Kind guy.
Ben Simmons  Marcus Smart  OG Anunoby  Giannis  Anthony Davis  Bench:  Jrue Holiday  Draymond Green  Rudy Gobert
Jrue Holiday. Didn't take a holiday after finals and went to play at Olympics. 😶
"If your point is that Jokic is more durable, it's a fair one to make and I won't argue that. But I'm just talking about when they're both healthy. Again tho, it is fair to point out AD's fragility   &gt;Jokic can be the best player on contender. AD cannot be relied on to do so.  That doesn't make any sense. A lot of players can be the best player on a 'contender'. And AD in NOLA went to the second round with Jrue Holiday and they got sent home because they played the superteam Warriors. I could also make the case that the Nuggets haven't actually proved to be a legitimate title contender yet  &gt;Jokic has an MVP and one of the best seasons from a big man ever. AD does not.  AD has had some phenomenal seasons...Jokic also doesn't have a playoff run as good as AD's in 2020. Saying someone has an MVP over another isn't a great argument because MVP seasons are relative..I mean Westbrook has an MVP and there are a lot of guards without one I'm taking over him. Having an MVP isn't the be-all lol"

Jrue Holiday.
"so is Jrue Holiday this year, what’s your point? rondo still wasn’t better than AD or Dame. was he better then tatum? butler?"
Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday missed a whopping 1596 games to injury
"No offense dude but it's clear you didn't watch young LeBron if you're talking about having more success. That dude carried a team with one of Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Boobie Gibson, or Big Z as his second best player to an NBA finals appearance at age 22. Giannis has played with Khris Middleton his whole career and couldn't make it to the ECF until they added Jrue Holiday and won a ring during a wacky covid/injury-ridden season. Giannis is absolutely exceptional, don't get me wrong, but LeBron was just different."
"So the overall story is the struggle of the Bucks.  Firstly, the Bucks are a small market. This is a term used to describe teams that originate from lesser known and less popular cities. So for example, LA is a big market, and the consequence of this is that 1) Refs usually favour LA and 2) Free Agents always go to LA because it's a big market. Free Agents are unsigned players, and they always pick LA.  Second, in 2019, Giannis got his first MVP, a regular season award. This was a contested MVP and lots of people say he didn't deserve it. Still, he got it. In 2019, the Bucks were one of the favourites to go to the finals but they failed, and lost to the Raptors. It was a dissapointment, but eh, the Raptors were great.  Then, 2020 happened. In 2020, the Bucks lost to the Miami Heat in the 2nd round. Now, the Bucks took a MASSIVE leap in 2020. Giannis had his best season yet, the Bucks were better than ever, and the Heat were a 5th or 6th seed that nobody noticed. Yet, the Bucks lost in 5 games out of 7 to the Heat, and got demolished. This was awful for the Bucks, as they were the MASSIVE favourites. It was worse because Giannis lost in the exact same way as 2019. A bunch of good defenders built a wall to stop Giannis from getting into his spots and he couldn't do anything about it. Now, Giannis was hated by seemingly everyone and was a choker.   Then, the 2020 offseason. In this offseason, 2 big things happened. First, the Bucks traded for Jrue Holiday. In this trade, they gave up a TON of assets and picks, essentially screwing their future just to get a chance to win a championship now. This was their way of telling Giannis ""We're putting our faith into you."" Giannis responded by signing one of the biggest contracts in NBA history. Now remember what I said in point one. The Bucks were a small market, so it's hard for small markets to get superstars. In the past 10 years, 3 superstars had ditched their small market teams for big markets. Giannis re-signing was MASSIVE for the Bucks, and Bucks fans. They got to keep Giannis for sure for another few years. With Jrue and Giannis back, that's the beginning to their road of success. They also got other additions, for example, PJ Tucker, who became very important later on.  Now, the 2021 regular season. This season was different for the Bucks. Giannis and the Bucks didn't care as much. They didn't try so hard to get the best record, because the priorities had shifted, it was all about the playoffs. Playoffs come. Round 1. Bucks vs Heat, the team the Bucks had lost to miserably last year. Bucks get their revenge, and DOMINATE the Heat, beating them in 4.  A sweep, no losses.  Next match. Another thing I didn't mention, in the 2020 offseason, superstar MVP James Harden had demanded a trade to the Nets to form a superteam with KD and Kyrie. Yet another superstar ditching their team, as mentioned.  This Nets big 3 was the easy favourites. In the first 2 games, the Bucks were decimated, but they adjusted. The Bucks supporting cast, specifically Jrue and Khris as well as Giannis were being doubted heavily. In this series, Kyrie got injured and so did Harden, but Harden stayed in the series, while limited, with KD and the rest of the team. The Bucks clawed their way back in, and finally got to game 7, in which Giannis carried and they defeated the favoured superteam Nets. Next series, against another underdog, the Hawks, who had defeated the Sixers in an upset which has led to all the Ben Simmons nonsense, but that's unrelated.   Hawks vs Bucks, in this series, there's one key event for this story. Giannis gets injured, badly. He literally bends his leg INWARDS. He's out for the series but the Bucks supporting cast carries.   Good time to talk about the Bucks supporting cast. Jrue, Khris, Bobby, PJ, Lopez, Pat, literally everyone performs spectacularly. PJ had his moment against the Nets, guarding KD well. Khris was amazing throughout, but he struggled a bit against the Nets here and there, still clutch. Jrue's moment was to come.  Giannis is back for the finals against the Suns. Despite BENDING HIS LEG INWARDS he's back within like a week. Game 1 loss. Game 2, he drops like 40 and loses. They're down 0-2 again. Then, the Bucks change. Game 3, Giannis has 40, they win by 20. Then, Game 4, they tie the series as Giannis has a fantastic game and Khris has nearly 40 points. Also... Giannis has one of if not the greatest blocks in a finals game ever. Then, game 5. Remember Jrues moment? With 20 seconds left, Booker about to take a shot to take the lead, Jrue steals the ball from Booker, pushes the fastbreak and throws an insane lob to Giannis that Giannis somehow finishes.  Then, game 6. But before that, I'll quickly explain Bucks in 6. So, during the early 2010s, Lebron left the Cavs in one of the most famous moments in NBA history to join the Heat. They created the Heatles, one of the greatest teams ever. That didn't matter to Brandon Jennings, who was in the 8th seeded Bucks team. He kept insisting that they would beat the FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR favoured Heat in 6 games. They didn't, and they got demolished, but the Bucks fans never forgot Jenning's perseverance, so they kept the phrase up, Bucks in 6. The Bucks beat the Hawks to make their first finals in 50 years, in 6 games. Another key note. Giannis throughout this run had been struggling with his free throws. He'd absolutely brick them and his long form made it so crowds would chant and count, to show he took too long on his FTs as he missed.  With that said, game 6 happens. Giannis drops 50 points, 13 rebounds and 5 blocks and closes the series, while shooting 17/19 from the free throw line, beating the Suns and winning the finals in 6 games for the first time in 50 years.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Yeah that's it. Copy and paste if you want."
"MIP has historically been 2 kinds of players in the last 10 ish years. Since Kevin Love won it, it’s been either a first time starter making the playoffs or a first time all-star. On player to do neither was Dragic on a 48 win suns team.  I’m thinking it’s going to be an Eastern Conference guard. With Ben and Kyrie both likely not making it, there’s 2 all-star spots available. There *are* some vets going to be looking for that spot though. Lowry can maybe get back and I think Jrue Holiday has a chance if he gets some media help."
On jrue holiday of all people
"These what-if scenarios that attribute success of failure to random stuff are annoying. Like, we could attribute their success to the bee that stood on the windshield of the team bus for one second because it made the driver speed up ever so slightly and that made Jrue Holiday get distracted from his podcast which took his motivation to shoot more threes in game four and resulted in them gaining momentum and winning the series."
"Trae Young. Ja Morant. Van Vleet. Jrue Holiday. Deaaron fox, jamaal Murray.   That’s 13 right there before getting to lamelo or Conley both who also have case as do a few others."
"Jrue Holiday was terrible on offense for most of the Bucks championship run. Super inefficient and inconsistent. Now of course D Rose can’t play defense anywhere near as good, which is why Holiday was so crucial. But offensively Rose probably does better on the Bucks than Holiday did this past playoffs.   Rose could be a 3rd option if the top two are all stars or better. For example on the Nets, or the 76ers, or the Warriors, or Nuggets, or Clippers. Assuming health, Rose would be a great 3rd option behind those teams all stars."
"he isn't consistent enough to be 3rd player on a championship team. look at jrue holiday, drose is nowhere near his level"

"Before this offseason I’d agree with you, but the organisation has made some extremely questionable moves since the lottery balls rolled their way in 2019.  They let Lonzo walk as a RFA for no reason whatsoever. They made his replacement a guy who has never shot above 39% from the field in his NBA career and a massive downgrade on defense. Overall they paid more draft compensation in the two deals than they received while simultaneously receiving the worse bundle of players both now and five years in the future.  My grievances with this team don’t stop there. They traded for a non-shooting big in Steven Adams knowing full well that their star’s main offensive weakness is perimeter shooting. They gave up George Hill, a first and two seconds in that deal. They gave up *Jrue Holiday* of all people for Eric Bledsoe, Hill, and a bunch of picks. They had the option of taking De’Andre Hunter and instead flipped him for Jaxson Hayes (again, not a bad player at all, but still a non-shooting big next to a guy who attempted 14 threes his whole rookie season) and some guys who immediately got flipped for seconds. As an OKC fan, I know all too well the importance of hoarding draft picks as a bad team, but *the Pelicans were not a bad team*. They finished 4 games out of the play-in spot in the bubble, were only 2 games out last year, and I guarantee that their 23rd-ranked defense would’ve improved if they had someone who made the All-Defensive 1st Team playing next to another All-Defense caliber guy in Lonzo in the backcourt, possibly enough to even lift them out of the play-in group. Long story short, the Pelicans have had plenty of chances to make the playoffs since Zion landed in NOLA, and they have capitalised on almost none of those opportunities.  To be clear, **I don’t believe Zion is nearly as unhappy as the media make him out to be in New Orleans, but there are certainly lots of reasons why he wouldn’t be totally happy with the team that drafted him**."
The bucks championship was like 85% Giannis so let’s not go around acting like Jrue holiday was the main reason the bucks won and the sixers were foolish to trade him
Jrue Holiday was slow to recover from COVID and said it affected his conditioning for a while
"He was traded away for Jrue Holiday, and now he's back"
"&gt;Small point guard defense is heavily overrated,  It is? Someone tell NBA Champion Jrue Holiday, he didn't get that message!"
"Ben Simmons made an all-nba team as a non-centre who's a much better defender than offensive player. He's a rare case, but there's certain realities about how valuable a defensive focused perimeter player can be.  I don't think it's a coincidence that the years Iguodala's impact stats went way up is when he moved into a significantly smaller role where opposing teams weren't focused on him as much and he was against worse players.  The more your volume goes up, the harder it is to be efficient.  Part of the struggle of superstars is teams gameplanning and loading up to stop you, taking the brunt of the opposing team's efforts. It's easier when someone else is carrying that load.  Carmelo was the second star, Stoudemire was already there. Kawhi is a prime recent example where he tied his going to the Clippers with them getting a second star there. PG doesn't go there without Kawhi and it's questionable as to whether Kawhi goes there without a second star signed on. AD to the Lakers, Harden to the Nets etc.  The point isn't that it works every time, getting one superstar doesn't guarantee a second. But generally when stars move they move to be with another one.  &gt;Not trading Jrue Holiday.  And then what? What's the overall vision? Make Jrue Holiday Iguodala 2.0 and run back more years of being of ok to good? How is that going to lead them to a title?  However Atlanta got there, they ended up drafting high and got what looks like a franchise cornerstone, and without Trae Young their future would look nice but meh. Hoping to be unintentionally bad one year isn't really great strategic vision.  Lebron and his teams by that point had become pretty notorious for regular season coasting.  With all due respect to Sefolosha, I don't think he's the difference between them getting swept by the Cavs and beating the Warriors."
"&gt; He's never made an all-nba game for example, it's not about offense vs defense, it's the overall package.  But that's the point.  We say things like ""the overall package"" but what we really mean is ""offense, and maybe if you're really good at offense, we'll also count your defense.""   Yeah, Andre never made an all-NBA team, absolutely true: and based on every measure we have of actual production on the court that accurately reflects defense, that's a huge mistake. He was CLEARLY a top-12 player in the league during that period. The fact is that defense as a whole is hugely undervalued (less so today, but even still it is today) and shot creation is over-valued.  We deem players who are worse than Iguodala was in that period ""superstars.""  e.g., Westbrook. I guess what we mean by ""superstars"" is ""floor-raising offensive players.""  I mean, that's what gets your all-star nods and all-NBA nods.  (Interestingly enough, I remember an interview Iguodala gave about this. He basically said that in terms of giving advice to his son, or to another young player, that he wouldn't recommend that they took the path he did, because scorers get all the accolades and thus way more money. He won more, taking his path, but he left a lot of money on the table.)  The only defense-first all-NBA players you ever get are centers, and that's because in some years there simply aren't any great offensive centers. I mean, look at the all-NBA teams - where are the great defensive non-centers who weren't also scoring 18+ppg in that season? Are you saying no such players exist? (And bear in mind, some of those guys who made all-NBA teams were really bad at defense, while Iguodala was NOT really bad at offense).   In any event, if the point is that the conventional wisdom vastly underrates elite defense that isn't coupled with volume scoring, especially from non-centers, then pointing to all-NBA teams doesn't really argue for much since all-NBA is voted on by the media that largely represents the conventional wisdom.   &gt; The realities of player movement is stars want to move to other stars. If you get the first one then it's easier to get the second or even third one. The hard part is getting the first one.  The Knicks were never able to build around Carmelo. Portland's never been able to get a second star to go with Dame. Dallas never found a second star to go with Dirk, and to date haven't managed to do so with Luka. Indiana was never able to get a second guy next to PG. It doesn't seem like people have been lining up to play with Giannis or Kawhi.   &gt; What strategy should Hinkie have followed that was better?  Not trading Jrue Holiday.   &gt;  Their long term title chances are better now after they bottomed out, picked Trae Young really high.  Atlanta never said, ""let's trade a great young player to bottom out.""   Atlanta was in a position where they lost some guys to free agency, some of their free agency acquisitions weren't as good as they hoped, and they suddenly found themselves with no good players.   That's the difference between all these other teams and what Philly did. Atlanta wasn't in a hurry to get good, and they weren't averse to letting guys go for assets, but their philosophy was ""draft upside guys with star potential - get the 19, 20-year old kids who might grow into something special.""   And they got those guys, and put them in a system to try to get them working together, building something.   Also, I think you're under-valuing Atlanta's title equity in 2015, when they were 3-1 against the Cavs in the regular season and then the NYPD broke the leg of guy the team was counting on to make LeBron work for it. (LeBron was 24-5-6 with a -10 pts/100 differential against the Hawks in the regular season. 30/11/9 with a +15 pts/100 differential in the ECF). But of course, Thabo, as a defensive wing who doesn't score a lot, was not seen by the general public as a significant loss despite literally being the front line of their defense against LeBron)."
"it was a move that was too criticized for how it affected the team.    sign and trade Brogdon net us RJ Hampton, Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill.    RJ Hampton was traded alongside George Hill, Eric Bledsoe and picks for Jrue Holiday.    not having Brogdon on the contracts (under the tax) allowed us have MLE to sign DJ Augustin and Bobby Portis.    DJ Augustin was traded for PJ Tucker.    Sam Merill was traded for Grayson Allen.    in all comes down to hindsight, but not signing Brogdon has 1) still allowed us to win a title, 2) go over the tax and have a core of Giannis-Khris-Jrue for the next ~4 years, and 3) netted us Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen, and Jordan Nwora who will all be in the rotation going forward.     on the other hand, if the Bucks had extended Brogdon, we still may win a chip in 2020 or 21 (not guaranteed obviously) but is that with Brogdon as the starting PG, or was he traded anyway for a higher tier player (could be Jrue, could be CP3)."
" &gt; Why not trade your starting 5 and your 1st rounder for DLO? Lopez was an impending free agent, and they liked DLO more than Kuzma. This cleared cap space for a potential FA.  A lot of this wasn't about cap space for a potential FA.   The point was that Brook Lopez, at the time of the trade, was 28, and the Nets correctly realized that they were a couple of years away, and by the time the rest of the team was good he'd be in his declining years.  With Levert, they were giving up Thad Young, who, similarly, was in the second half of his 20s, and likely out of his prime by the time the Nets were competitive.   That's really different from what the Sixers were doing trading away *a 22-year-old all-star Jrue Holiday* for Nerlins Noel and (eventually) Efrid Payton. The Nets were acquiring guys who they thought could be 22-year-old all-stars (D'Lo), not trading them away for two mid-lottery picks.   That Jrue trade was a classic ""A draft pick could be anything! It could even be Jrue Holiday!"" move. When you're valuing asset accumulation is more important than 22-year-old all-stars, you're doing it wrong.   The ""multi-year intentional suck to get good"" has resulted in zero titles in the past 40 years. Yeah, teams have sucked. Yeah, teams have even tanked for a season. Instead, the ""get as good as you can while maintaining flexibility and looking for opportunities to add pieces"" has resulted in titles for the Bucks, Raptors, Warriors, Spurs, and Heat in the past decade.   (The one exception might be the Lakers. I'm open to the argument that the Lakers were stealth tanking by giving Kobe his final extension, they're also one team which is playing by fundamentally different rules than everybody else.)"
"&gt; [Alliteration] The same season that Jrue Holiday wins a championship, the core of the process implodes.  The same season Jrue Holiday scales summit, Sixers staples stumble and separate."
"That skill is so underrated.   LeBron, Harden, CP3, Dame, Luka, Trae, Kyle Lowry, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley etc.   There's a reason why all these guys, their team's offenses don't go through lulls and are built for the playoffs."
"Not even..remotely.  [Alliteration] The same season that Jrue Holiday wins a championship, the core of the process implodes.  [Cacophony] The same season that Jrue Holiday wins a championship, the core of the process implodes.  [Onomatopoeia] The same season that Jrue Holiday wins a championship, the core of the process implodes."
"Worst game I ever saw was in the 2009 Summer League in Orlando.  It started with both players whiffing on the jump ball, and at one point the announcer made some joke like, ""I never expected something involving \[Dionte\] Christmas and \[Jrue\] Holiday to be so depressing."""
"&gt; He's good enough offensively even without the shooting to be the no1 option on a championship team.  No, he's not. He can't self create well enough and without that threat, he doesn't draw the gravity to get easier shots for his teammates, offenses where he isn't playing with LeBron/Jrue Holiday have been terrible.   AD is an outstanding play finisher, one of the greatest of all-time.   All the #1 options on a championship team are SIGNIFICANTLY better with the ball in their hands running an offense than AD.   AD's limitations of self-creation on offense wouldn't matter if Westbrook was in his prime or hell even if LeBron was just a few years younger."
"When Kawhi was plotting his move to LA in 2019. Kawhi reportedly asked Kd, Jimmy Butler, Jrue Holiday, and PG to come to LA. PG said yes."
What's crazy is there are not many more things more difficult in the NBA than being injured and being defending by Jrue Holiday who is 100% determined to win a championship.
"Depth can be gotten easily.  Guys like Jrue Holiday, Cameron Payne, Jae Crowder, Booby Portis, Brook Lopez who make the rest of the roster of championship level teams are traded, waived, or developed all the time.  Lakers won a championship with Caruso starting game 6, with guys like Rondo and Dwight Howard filling major roles on the team.    Philly should have said ""Take anything from our team except Embiid"" for Harden, and then built around those two."
"&gt;Never said they have to get rid of Wiseman, they can keep him, they have all their picks to trade.  Yeah, but what are those picks likely to be worth?   You have to think if an all-star moves it's for something better than the Jrue Holiday package (3 picks, 3 swaps, where it's highly likely none of those picks will be in the top 20). The Jrue Holiday package only looked tempting because of the possibility that Giannis wouldn't sign the extension and would leave in a year. I honestly don't think NO does that deal if they know Giannis is signing.   You've got to think the team is very happy with Poole on a cost-controlled contract this year and next, and when he's due for a raise the Wiggins contract is up.   I don't know if they'll be able to successfully juggle the youth movement, but with Jordan stepping up, I think they're going to be strongly inclined to stand pat. Sure, if Wiggins, (Kuminga or Wiseman) and picks get them something, they'll think about it - but if they send out Wiggins (necessary for contract matching) and Poole for an all-star, you're trading two major-minutes players for one, and those forces guys like Iguodala (who you really don't want playing more than 15mpg, and even that might be optimistic) or Lee (borderline non-rotation guy) into major minutes.   I don't think they want to do that."
Where are Jrue Holiday and Middleton? Bucks don’t win with replacement level guys in their place.
"I have no idea why anyone would rank Rudy Gobert over guys like Zion, Jrue Holiday, Zach Lavine, etc."
"Ben Simmons believes he's in 'same conversations as championship caliber point guards like Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, and Jrue Holiday."
"Dejountae Murray, Jrue Holiday, and Antetokounmpo trio is such a scary defense"
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
Point blank layups???? Fam gimme 100 3 pointers contested by Jrue Holiday and I still dominate Steph.
"This...is a pretty massive over simplification. Jrue Holiday showed pretty clearly how valuable an elite, on ball perimeter defender can be at disrupting the other team's offensive game plan. The counter play to help defenders is also pretty underrated, Giannis does have weaknesses to exploit like how quicker guys in the league with strong pull-up games can switch onto him and exploit his tendency to drop.  All in all, yes, Giannis is still the correct answer, Kawhi specifically was never the best PnR defender and that's an exploitable weakness of his, but it's a little more nuanced than a lot of people here are making it out to be."
"Floor: How good a player can immediately make a team by virtue of his own skill. Most floor raisers are typically bucket-getters or defensive monsters that struggle to do much else.  Ceiling: How good a player can make his team when taking into account the other 4 players on the court. Ceiling-raisers are usually versatile (offensively and defensively). Draymond is probably one of the best examples of this, as is Jrue Holiday."
Unbiased but  Cade: Luka  Green: MJ without the defense  Mobley: AD  Barnes: Draymond Green with a jumper/handle  Suggs: Jrue Holiday   Floor  Cade: Kyle Anderson  Green: Malik Monk  Mobley: Jabari Parker with D  Barnes:   Suggs: Cory Joseph
The bucks added jrue holiday and then won the chip. Who is going to be the jazz's acquisition that will put them over the top?
"Trae wins mvp  Jrue holiday wins DPOY  Tyler Herro (as much as I can’t stand him, he’s just balling right now) wins 6MOTY  Kyrie never gets vaccinated and bucks somehow beats them in a very close game 7 which causes Kyrie to get traded and then he retires.   Bucks vs Nuggets in finals"
jrue holiday went 2-23  kenyon martin went like 3-23 in the nba finals once  and the infamous john starks game
In terms of impact - big jrue holiday with worse playmaking and more consistent scoring.
Jrue Holiday
"Jrue is one of my favorite players but he is not a great scorer. He can do it when he needs to, and was a better scorer when he was in NO. If Nwora is really as crazy as his coaches seem to think, he should already be past Holiday. Not that he's a better player by any means, but Jrue Holiday as a measure of scoring threat is not a great measure."
"It didn’t have to be MCW and Tony Wroten. The “process” was ditching guys like Jrue Holiday and Thad Young who ceiling’d out as a 1st or 2nd round playoff team to end up with Embiid and Simmons.   The theory is sound, but the cost was great (a team with Wroten and MCW) and, as we see, the result still not guaranteed."
"If you’re team has to bench you at the end of a playoff game because you literally refuse to shoot the ball you’re not a top 25 nba player.   This list is not in an exact order, it’s just players who are better than Simmons.   Ben Simmons sucks  1. Lebron  2. Curry  3. Giannins  4. Kd  5. Jokic 6. Ad 7. Kawhi  8. Westbrook  9. Lilliard 10. Embiid 11. Luka  12. Harden 13. Kyrie  14. Tatum  15. Beal 16. Paul George  17. Trae young 18. Jaylen brown  19. Jamal murray 20. Devin booker 21. Chris paul 22. Kris Middleton  23. Jrue holiday  24. Zach lavine 25. Pascal siakam"
Michael Jordan  Chris Paul  Stephen Curry  Jrue Holiday  Charles Barkley
"&gt; his defense is worse than people tend to think  compared to who? comparing him to Jrue holiday, yes, Steph is a much worse defender. Compare him to scoring PGs like Lillard, Kyrie, Trey Young, etc, Steph is a better defender imo."
I'd give up a Jrue Holiday like package for Ben Simmons. Perhaps a bit less considering how he played during the playoffs.
It sounds like they are starting from jrue holiday and trying to increase from there
"The chain of comments is based upon prime Westbrook … the comment that started this is about MVP Russ.   Regardless, it doesn’t matter. Jrue didn’t have some super amazing playoff run and there’s more than enough signs that Westbrook healthy as a third option can perform better all while clearly being a better floor raiser.   Just saying “he hasn’t been outside the first round in 5 years” isn’t a very strong argument when compared to Jrue holiday who was failing to make the playoffs with Anthony Davis lmao.   When it comes to Westbrook, the argument just turns into narratives which is why I hate discussing him on this sub sometimes. Westbrook has factually proven he can adapt, Jrue being a third option isn’t an “insult,” it’s acknowledging the gap between prime Westbrook and prime Westbrook teams to current Jrue."
"Okay? He was outclassed in two of those, played  below his standards in one of them, and played garbage in another one (although hobbled)  That isn’t the debate. Westbrook’s career didn’t start in 2017. The question was about being able to be a championship guard. Westbrook in some part of his career has proven that no matter if you choose to believe it or not.   This debate is getting ridiculous. I’m not going to compare Jrue Holiday to the career of Westbrook because he beat up on mid/injured playoff teams and won a ring as a 3rd option while averaging hurt Westbrook efficiency numbers lmao.   Hes underperformed before, just as Jrue has with those Pelicans teams. They just aren’t as notable as his successes."
"It literally says nothing when you actually acknowledge context fuzzy butt scratcher.   In how many of those years were Russ teams the favorites to make the finals? 2012 and 2013 only, the year they made it and the year Russ got hurt.   Every other year he wasn’t favored to make it out of the West especially with PG or Harden. You just listed names when in reality, what has kept him away from the finals is injuries more than anything else.   Now if he had the injury luck of say, a Jrue Holiday …"
"Jrue Holiday has a higher AST/TO ratio than Jokic, Harden, Trae Young, etc.   Well I wouldn’t believe anything you said regardless, look at your Reddit name lmao.   And every single advanced creation and playmaking stat has the same names at the top: Trae, Russ, Luka, Harden, Bron, CP. All of them."
"which player can be the point guard on a championship team, Russell Westbrook or Jrue Holiday?"
Definitely Jrue Holiday.
This sounds right. I heard Jrue Holiday say that Giannis lifts heavy during the season lol
"I don't even think it's an argument, I think it's clear. Here are the PGs who have carried a team through playoff runs and won them series: Curry, Harden or Kyrie (whichever is a PG), Luka, CP3, Lillard, Trae, Lowry, Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jrue Holiday.  After that, there's a huge drop off in talent. This is the top 10."
"I literally said Holiday brings elite defense and basketball IQ to the table. The only reason i brought up shooting at all is because Ja Morant literally cannot make 3s at all, not some shooting slump that Jrue had."
He’s the guy but he got like no criticism for getting clamped by jrue holiday
They were Mike Conley Jrue Holiday level players. They don't matter?
Jrue Holiday has gotten a lot of gas after his 48 TS% playoff run.
"Replace Morant with Holiday and the Grizzlies aren’t close to the play ins. Jrue is great, but he’s not a floor raiser"
Yeah jrue holiday or Lowry could never be a championship point guard good point
He could be the next Jrue Holiday
"Jrue Holiday has always had a special place in my heart, but now he’s ascended to one of my favorite players ever. I just love the guy. I try and model my game after him by playing defense and missing layups lol 😂"
Luka and it's really not that close. Lillard is too small and got clamped up by Jrue Holiday and Rondo. They basically got swept because he got shut down. Kawhi and PG aka two all nba level defenders couldn't do anything to Luka for 2 years.
"He had a career year but its a long season. The top 4 teams in the bubble all played poorly. It's just that the Heat are less talented than the Lakers, Boston and Nuggets so Jimmy had to do more hard carrying and Bucks just focused everything into stopping him. To buck's credit, they threw Giannis, PJ Tucker, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday at him at all times."
"For most Pelican franchise records, you'll find 4 names. Paul, David West, Jrue Holiday, and Anthony Davis."
Bucks match up with the Clippers incredibly well. Clippers love there small ball 5 out lineup and Giannis at the 5 would decimate whatever the Clippers would try to throw at the Bucks.  Paul George also said his toughest matchup in the league is Jrue Holiday. PJ &amp; Khris would’ve done just fine on Kawhi too.
"Steph Curry, Giannis, KAT, Embiid, Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum, Mike Conley, Malcolm Brogdon…tons of really intelligent and thoughtful people excel in this league. The Kyrie Irvings of the world are just always louder.  I really wanted to put the Lopez twins in there too but the list can’t be all Bucks lol"
Remember when a few players like Jrue Holiday wore the ninja headband but then it was banned? That was still one of the worst decisions of the past decade by the NBA
"Yeah I see that exact same thing and I’m not sure if it’s going to. He has all the tools, and he deserves this trust at this point. He was a top 10 pick so we will see if he can blossom into that 3rd guy for a championship team. If he can do a Jrue Holiday type thing then the Celtics will be trouble for everybody."
The next Jrue Holiday
And baby Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday was traded
"The Suns need to stop thinking about this for fair market value and think about it solely from the standpoint of building a championship roster.  If you think having Ayton on the roster is critical for winning a title over the next 3ish years, then pay him what he wants even if you think you are over paying.  Last offseason everyone was saying the Bucks overpaid for Jrue Holiday both with draft picks and contract extension $.  Now they are the champs and every cent that they paid to construct their roster was worth it."
Jrue Holiday
"Yeah he’s not convincing me of the defensive aspect, not when the Bucks were out there blowing 30 and 20 point leads.   Scoring helps your defense.   So when Giannis just jacks up threes at an inefficient rate he puts pressure on his defense. Long shots mean long rebounds, and even if the other team doesn’t score in transition, it’s still hard on your team to get back and get the defense set.   Giannis, as much as he carried the team to the championship also probably caused them to play series longer than they needed to.   Individually he’s good at defense and give him credit for that, but defense has a lot to do with your team and scheme, whereas a great offensive talent can simply dominate. PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday on your squad really help you out."
"&gt; Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever  Bobby Portis rebounded and hit his open 3s, how is that not having an impact? Hitting your 3s is the best thing you can do on a Giannis led team.   &gt; Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind)  Lowry is a much weaker defender than Jrue. And Jrue on the Bucks moves the needle more than Lowry on the Heat because the Bucks are a more talented team with a generation talent on it. We only needed Jrue to be the 3rd/2nd guy on any given night to loosen up Giannis and Middleton. Lowry being better than Jrue on offense doesn't mean anything.   &gt;  Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points.  Yeah because y'all quadruple teamed him and he passed it out to our shooters. That's why the series was one sided. You couldn't counter attack once we actually hit our 3s and you rolled over. Giannis didn't have to score.   &gt; Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then.  So Bam will suddenly outplay Lopez because *you* expect him to in your homer mind? No facts behind it, just because *you* a redditor ""expects it"". Okay.   &gt; Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat.  So Bryn Forbes being gone is a loss for us and a factor. But his much better replacement (who could even start over Donte) is a non factor? Tell me how that makes sense."
"Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever. Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind), so I expect him to have the same impact Jrue had for the Bucks. Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points. All Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then. Khris Middleton did have good series. Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat."
"&gt; Was jrue holiday the difference in damn near getting swept in second round to nba champions  No the bubble was the difference. Our team was 5 months removed from the cohesive, contending basketball we were playing prior to shut down and our players never wanted to be there."
"So Jrue Holiday and Bobby Portis weren't good that series? That's ignoring the key players who weren't newcomers that we still have btw, Giannis, Middleton and Lopez.We also have a player than Forbes in Grayson Allen this time around, so that point is absolutely moot.  Heat didn't only get swept, they got blown out badly in of those games. Lowry doesn't change that."
i meant more of a versatile type guard or wing that the sixers have lacked almost in entirety since 2012 with Jrue Holiday.  All those guys have their role for sure but they are mostly one skill players that can only do a little of everything else.  Sixers have been dying for someone like maxey for a decade.  Theyve been down horrendously bad in that department so we really need maxey to be the truth
"He’s not Jrue Holiday or anything, but Curry has been underrated on defense for the better part of a decade"
"Playoff basketball is not the same as regular season...he ran out of gas when he had to face Giannis, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday guarding and double teaming him at all times."
"unsure for now but it is definitely encouraging and hes learning on the job because hes never been a point guard before but his passing has been evolving.  The sixers have had a gigantic hole in their roster of a dynamic ""regular"" guard that can drive and shoot since having Jrue Holiday in 2012.  Its just such a breath of fresh air especially since its been obviously our biggest need that we wanted to add to Ben and Joel since forever ago.  Sixers jjust find it impossible to get any capable guards"
Jrue Holiday was better in 2018 than anybody else on the Heat.
"Bucks literally added a non-all star in Jrue Holiday (the definition of a solid player, which is what everyone is arguing the 6ers should trade for), and that's what they needed to win a chip. You're wrong. The challenge is finding an all-time player like Giannis and Embiid. The easy part is surrounding them with solid players. For some reason, the 6ers are burning Embiid's prime by struggling with the easy part."
Jrue Holiday is not even an all-star and he was the difference that was needed in order to elevate his all-time teammate to a chip. You're objectively wrong.
"Is Patrick Beverly on a Mac, is Jrue Holiday, is Marcus smart? That is some terrible reasoning by you, if Ben Simmons gets a mac then it means you can’t give one to a good offensive scorer. Draymond doesn’t have a max because he doesn’t score.  Golbert is on a Mac because he gets points and plays defense, same with Giannis."
Bro you were blaming 6’1” Rondo for not being able to guard 6’11” because AD can’t fight over a Jrue Holiday screen lmao.
"I mean he never had great teams but they weren’t exactly dogshit either. He had a team with a pre-surgery Cousins, rondo and Jrue Holiday - that’s not dogshit"
"Umm, Jrue Holiday, Rondo, and Cousins were pretty good teammates. Remember this is Cousins prior to surgery."
"Look at their latest downfalls too.  Lost Lonzo Ball for nothing. Julius Randle for nothing.  Jrue Holiday for Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee).  Steve Adams for Valcunius, Eric Bledsoe to clear salary cap space to sign nobody.  Unable to keep Zion in game shape, Zion has repeatedly shown disgust with the team and is likely to move on when his contract is over.  Brandon Ingram will probably leave too."
"I can easily think of 30 players better than Simmons (I'll exclude Embiid from the list)  In no real order: 1. Lebron 2. KD 3. Giannis 4. Curry 5. Luka 6. Jokic 7. Harden 8. PG 9. Cp3 10. Kawhi 11. AD 12. Lillard 13. Tatum 14. Zion 15. Butler 16. Beal 17. Trae Young 18. Donovan Mitchell 19. KAT 20. Zach Lavine 21. Booker 22. Bam 23. Jaylen Brown 24. Jrue Holiday 25. SGA 26. Ja Morant 27. Rudy Gobert 28. Middleton 29. DeRozan 30. LaMelo Ball  Also Kyrie Irving if he actually wanted to play basketball  There is probably some you could make arguments for one way or the other and obviously fit comes into play so I doubt they're trying to trade for say Rudy Gobert, but I also probably forgot some players you could add to this list as well.  That being said you're also probably not getting a 1 for 1 trade for Simmons with the current situation. So I guess you hold out and hope the situation improves"
"Besides centers (Jokic, Gobert, Adebayo), other good players are:  CP3, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley, Siakam"
"I mean of you consider lowry, siakam, middleton, and  jrue holiday role players than 95% of the league is role players. Those 4 are all much better than anyone on the sixers"

"He has the potential to be a better Jrue Holiday one day, although I don't know if Dort will ever develop Jrue's playmaking skills."
This is the game we also likely win without LeBron if Anthony Davis wasn't such a coward. Shying away from defending Giannis late in the game so he could over a struggling Jrue Holiday leaving Russ and THT left to cover 7 foot tall Giannis. Bullshit stuff.
"He had fucking Jrue Holiday containing dribble penetration for him in NO. And he's been awful on d the entire year so far, not just recently."
Jrue Holiday is incredible on the court but man he looks terrible on offense sometimes
Giannis dominating in small market with Jrue Holiday while Anthony Davis rots in LA surrounded by scrubs is some poetic justice
"To be fair, David Griffin had to let go of Lonzo Ball and Jrue Holiday to be able to get the right players around Zion. Their money could’ve gone to the right guys, could’ve even signed someone like Lonzo Ball or Jrue Holiday!"
Jrue Holiday and Kris Middleton are leagues ahead of Tobias and CJ lmao stop it
They were 20-11 between mid December and the end of February that year and that's despite Jrue Holiday being hurt for most of January. It was absolutely reasonable to say they were in the playoff mix as a healthy team.
I was about to say that lol. A spiked up derozan who can shoot the 3. The athleticism of Zach lavine. Defense of dejounte Murray or jrue holiday.
"You're honestly not completely wrong, and it's definitely not one sided as people make it seem. AD has been struggling in the past year so it's really the recency bias that's kicking in.  Give Anthony Davis a team consisting of quality starters like Jameer, Hedo, Rashard, etc instead of Jrue Holiday + trash and he'll have some good playoff runs as well. Prior to joining the Lakers he averaged 30/12 across 3 playoff series while being the backbone of his team's defense."
Bledsoe and 2 useless picks is an overpay for Jrue Holiday?
"Yeah, he's in that zone that Jrue Holiday was in back in like 2016, playing winning ball for a losing team. Unfortunately I think he's probably a little to old to secure the bag like Jrue did barring some accolades, he is an incredible value for 10mil a year but he'll be 31 the next time he hits FA. Contenders should be calling about him."
"...With the way coaching is going it's gotta be someone whom stars respect. As insane as this is, my guess for good coaches would be...  Rajon Rondo, Steph Curry, Seth Curry, Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Udonis Haslem, Spencer Dinwiddie, Fred Van Vleet, Lonzo Ball."
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
Ben has gotten significantly overrated. He's a good defender but the idea he has as much impact as Draymond or Gobert is just silly. He's more of the Jrue Holiday / Marcus Smart type. Great but not carrying a teams defense either. And those guys don't cripple your teams offense
Ig you are new to the nba but Ben has always been labeled this lmao like you do realize this is the guy afraid to take a 3 and memed to death since his rookie year ? You do know these things right lol and that’s cool if he really has mental health problems he can take time off like Jrue holiday did but he won’t get paid so you know that’s not happening lmao mental health is important but not as important as money is what Ben Simmons is proving
Bet lol tell Ben playing with college kids when the NBA szn is active isn’t a good look lmao dude is under a contract he signed right ? Why doesn’t he do what jrue holiday did and take some Time off lmao
"Jrue Holiday had 1 season above league average true shooting with AD, was constantly injured, and was only a good fulltime starter after 2016."
A.David is most overrated of the NBA in 2000s. He fucking sucked with so many seasons with NOP. He couldnt make playoffs many years. Pelicans had Jrue Holiday-Cousins- Rondo in different seasons. In terms of making playoff appearances he is probably not better than A.Drummond’s Pistons or KAT’s TWolves
Pelicans fan chiming in. AD is not a leader. That was the biggest problem on that Pelicans team. AD nor Jrue Holiday would ever take over the team. Injuries and lack of leadership qualities is AD's worst characteristics.
"Not everytime, Most of the time. Jrue Holiday was locking Dame up in the 2018 series."
"Mobile wings with length. No one's shutting him down but players like Giannis, Simmons, AD, PG, Kwahi and Bron if he's trying. Also defensive specialists with a low centre of gravity like PJ Tucker, Jrue Holiday and CP3 even. Shout out to Tony Allen as well."
To be fair KD has said the toughest defenders on him have been:  Tony Allen (6’4) PJ Tucker (6’5) Jrue Holiday (6’3)
"I agree with your point, but you shouldn't exclude KG, Jokic, or even Giannis really. They only ever won anything when the guard play around them was great.  KG made the conference finals with the wolves when they had Spree and Cassell. After that, he had Pierce and Ray Allen in front of him.  Jokic made the WCF when Murray was playing out of his mind. Otherwise it's just been fine enough guard play to get a respectable exit in the second round.  Giannis has always had Kris Middleton, and as soon as they got an elite level guard in Jrue Holiday to get it to the rest of the shooters - bah god that's larry O.B.'s music!  AD had Jrue but ran into the Warriors - that's all you can do against an unbelievably stacked team. But his rosters were not constructed to win."
AD's career doesn't even touch Dwight's. AD has never done anything as the best guy on his team. Even his best series against the Blazers I would argue that Jrue Holiday was the reason they won
"Jrue holiday , k mid , and no dominant team/ lots of injuries and a very good supporting cast n built team. A team that stays positive without you the last few years BEFORE ADDING JRUE. Very comparable to trying to beat kd warriors. Said by a warriors flare too fuvking hell. I like Giannis but this shit is stupid af to compare"
Jrue Holiday might be the *best* teammate Giannis has played with
Jrue Holiday is the 2nd best teammate AD has played with
"They do when you're trying to argue that AD carried the team to a title, not to a finals appearance. And no, he wasn't 'undeniably' the best, he just had the best boxscore which is the same for you.   Like it's literally mind boggling to compare *LeBron James* to jrue holiday and khris middleton. AD could always afford to not be the best player on the team, as he did in the last 6 games. That was never an option for Giannis."
That was more due to the fact that Jrue holiday put Lillard in the torture chamber...that series Jrue was the MVP. So in AD's best series as a pelican...he wasn't even the best player on his own team.
"Ah yes jrue holiday who averaged 8.7 assists and 2.4 turnovers during the playoffs last year, what an absolute donkey of a pg"
"&gt; Hell, it took Giannis having a combo of Jrue and KMid to win.    Yeah, if Anthony Davis ever played with a great star guard like Jrue Holiday, he'd be super successful. At the very least, he'd make the playoffs consistently for sure!"
Jrue Holiday is really good lol
Yeah. You're right. A big man could never win the title as the best player on the team with (checks notes) Jrue Holiday as his starting PG.
"Kawhi was god in this series and no player would be able to stop him. Also, he hunted Luka in order to tire him out, because Luka was cooking Clippers as well. You can make a video of even Jrue Holiday getting sloppy on D.  Luka is very strong and mostly does a good job staying in front of his opponent."
"guess we have a different understanding of a word *incredible*, that's it.          I wouldn't argue Jrue Holiday is an incredible defender, but Deni Avdija being called *incredible* defender is (in my opinion) a reactionary take partly caused by those recent comments from Unseld Jr. about his defense."
"I agree with him and I'll try explaining it how I think of it. Anthony Davis is a top 5 talent in the league, maybe provides top 5 value in the league when he's on the court, but he isn't a top 5 player in the league. It's somewhat hard to distinguish those from each other.  When he's on the court his numbers don't ever not look good. He has an unbelievable midrange game, he can run the floor, catch lobs from anywhere, and then on defense clamp any 4 in the game, play great defense on most 5s not named Jokic or Embiid, and play elite help defense.   But there is something that is critically lacking in his game and it's hard to pinpoint. It's too cliché to say killer instinct, or heart, or silly sports platitudes like that. But AD is very evidently a player who can just will you to wins night in and night out. At times it seems like he doesn't even want to do that.   It's not normal for a player who is putting up 28/12/2/1.5/2 on 50% from the floor to miss the playoffs. It isn't normal for someone to put up those numbers and only get to 34 wins in a season, and especially because AD is clearly not a ""great stats, bad team"" guy. He's not an empty stats guy which is very much what KAT feels like right now. He can get those stats on a championship level team all the same, and give you valuable possessions on both sides.  A team with Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, sniper years Ryan Anderson, some ok but not very good guard/wing back ups like Toney Douglas, Tyreke Evans, Tim Frazier, James Ennis, and then some solid back up bigs in Ajinca and Asik shouldn't be 12-26 at the All-Sat break if you're the best player at your position in the league.   James Harden as a 23 year old pulled a starting 5 of him, Chandler Parsons, Omer Asik, Jeremy Lin, and Dontas Montejunas to 45 wins and took OKC to 6 games; and that was with Kevin McHale as coach. Then half that damn Pels team ended up going to Houston eventually too.  KG's running mates were Terrell Brandon, Wally World, Anthony Peeler, and Rasho Neserovic and he pulled into the playoffs in an even more competitive West.  Hakeem didn't have a single All-Star with him as he kept making it to the playoffs each year in the West.   Dirk the same thing, he took a team to the finals and lost in 6 (refs willing) that was starting Jason Terry, Josh Howard, old Jerry Stackhouse, and Erick Dampier.  Jokic won a playoff series last year against a high-powered Portland team with his top 4 guards out, one other guy who could score but not defend, and then a mix between 5'9"" rookies, just signed players, two way guys, and the reanimated corpse of Paul Milsap. This year without MPJ and Murray, and now Barton, Jokic is leading the Nuggets while putting up even better numbers and a top 10 defense...and they will sail into the playoffs.   But with Jrue Holiday and a bunch of 3pt marksman, Anthony Davis had years where he didn't even sniff the playoffs.   That just isn't normal. If you put any of these other guys on that team they're going to find a way into the playoffs, even if it's the 8 seed, even if they get swept. They're certainly going to win more than 30 games.   I think it speaks to Anthony Davis at his core is just a right hand man type of player. He may very well be the best ""2nd option"" of all time. He's this generation's Scottie Pippen who people sometimes even have as a top 5 player in the 90s. But AD just doesn't have that drive in him, or the specific skill, or desire, or whatever it is, to pull teams to wins. Pull them into the playoffs. Just find ways to get it done and get there. He isn't that guy...even though he obviously has all the talent in the world to do that, and has always put up numbers that SHOULD do that.   I mean damn even Carmelo took a team with a guard rotation of Pablo Prigioni, Ronnie Brewer, Raymond Felton, and a 39 year old Jason Kidd, 7ppg Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith, the decayed husk of Kenyon Martin, Steve Novak, and Tyson Chandler to round 2 of the playoffs. And Carmelo is not a better player than AD, whatsoever, in any way. But he is the kind of guy who is a bonified #1 option, who has the drive and will to just find wins and go for broke trying to get them in a way AD doesn't.  AD kind of always seems like he's holding back a little bit. The other night vs. I forget who, but AD was red hot the entire game and WB was...not, and to take the game winning shot what happened? They ran 1-4 flat with Westbrook who took a contested 30ft 3 and bricked it. AD was standing in the corner just watching it.   Now you could say that has something to do with coaching, and maybe it does, but not even Vogel is that bad. It's not like this was some misdirection play or a match up thing either. Also if you're that guy, if you're an All-NBA 1st team player, if you're this HOF two way incredible 30ppg dude...you should be demanding that shot. Especially when you are just draining jumpers all night. But he didn't, and that isn't the first time he's seemed to shy away from pivotal moments like that.   So in that sense AD is a ""very good"" player, but not a great player. He's an absolute incredible talent, incredible scorer, incredible defender, easy choice for the HOF. but as a ""player"" there is something that is critically missing from him. Something that you can find in almost all of his All-NBA 1st team peers from LeBron, to Jokic, to Embiid, CP, Dame, Curry, Doncic, Harden, KD, Butler, Trae, Morant, Mitchell there are so many of these guys who have that extra part of them. Even guys who haven't been All-Stars like Jamal Murray, Fox, Ant, Bogdanavich(s), grab hold of that moment more willingly and firmly than AD.  I mean good lord it's in Russ--that's half the reason he's so good at basketball--but AD should be the person taking that situation every single time. Not just over Russ but maybe over LeBron most of the time too. That's how good he is. Not just a single shot but just down the stretch in general.   AD is going to be one of the 5 greatest talents of this generation, and he's gonna pick up a lot of hardware, but there is just such a distinct generation between him and these other HOF peers of his when it comes to drive and will to win. Maybe AD is just apathetic, maybe he doesn't care that much and is just insanely good at basketball, I mean he is notoriously lazy about his workouts in the offseason which also isn't normal. I don't know. But there is absolutely something to it."
"I think this is the ideal lineup:   PG: Jrue Holiday   SG: Jimmy Butler   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Jerami Grant    C: Dwight Howard   That team is filthy defensively, then you have a bench of Horford, Wood, Holmes, McConnell, Fultz, Ish Smith, and George Hill. If we're ranking off of talent alone, Hill/Horford/Wood arguably have higher peaks than Jerami Grant, but Grant is needed to fix that very tenuous spacing, plus he's a more versatile defender who fits alongside Dwight."
"They wouldn't be the best by any means, but you could build a solid team from former sixers. A lot of the process guys turned out to be damn good elsewhere.  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Butler  SF: RoCo  PF: Jerami Grant  C: Christian Wood  Bench: Richaun Holmes, Fultz, Dario, Nerlens Noel, Iguadala, T.J McConnell, Thaddeus Young"
"It's weird the people defending the Pelicans are not mentioning them going all in on Lowry and whiffing.  That's THE reason they let Lonzo walk. So they'd have money for Lowry. It wasn't that Lonzo wanted more, it's that the Pelicans wanted Lowry more than Lonzo. That's the bet they made, and they lost.  The Pelicans have just made countless poor free agent choices.  Signing Bledsoe. Signing Adams. Then having to get rid of both and shipping off draft picks to do so.  When you think about the haul they got from Davis, they've squandered a ton of it. All those draft picks are all low first rounders. They've already lost Lonzo. Ingram, Hart and Zion from the draft are what is left. Zion is probably on his way out with the way things are going (or the dude is gonna gain so much weight his rehab will take forever).  And the Jrue Holiday ""haul"" ain't much. Two unprotected 1st round picks in 25 and 27, and can swamp in 24 and 26. Giannis will be in his prime when these picks begin to convey. The unprotected picks will be low 1st rounders, and the Pelicans will not swap picks for an even lower pick than they will probably have. And I think they've already traded one of these picks to get rid of either Bledsoe or Adams.  Maybe they find a steal there, but they probably won't.  David Griffin has just screwed up this whole thing.  I hate it when star players force their way out of town, but Zion would be well within his rights to leave. This ~~team~~ franchise is a dumpster fire."
&gt; Stars asking out is straight luck of the draw  Yeah totally not their fault at all they keep losing stars over and over. Just the luck of the draw.  &gt;But you’re still entirely missing the point. Windhorst is bitching that the currently constructed Pelicans want a Holiday-type player and they could have had one if they didn’t let him go.   I think he's blaming the Pelicans for losing Jrue. Are the Pelicans not to blame for being so far away from competing that Jrue asked out?
"""They seem to think the Pelicans could've kept Jrue Holiday if they wanted to, via extension. Likewise, Lonzo Ball was restricted.""     They obviously didn´t. What they are trying to say is that they lost both of those players without getting adequate value out of it"
Also Demar Derozan and Jrue Holiday.
"pick swaps are useless when you are a perma dogshit team vs a contender with a 26 y/o 2 time MVP...  so they got 1 washed Bledsoe and 2 first picks, if you wanna look at it that way and not include Adams, which prolly makes it look even worse as they either gave up RJ Hampton or a Nuggets first round pick and 2 second round picks... For that fucking contract. Just fucking unreal..  The only thing that might have value in that trade is the 27 Bucks draft pick (or ofc they somehow luck themselves into a good late first round pick in 25, which is unlikely as their best draftee (outside of the obvious pick Zion) in recent years is NAW lol)  https://www.nba.com/news/pelicans-acquire-steven-adams-eric-bledsoe-in-4-team-trade-jrue-holiday-to-milwaukee"
"This might be homerism but Ball is a midrange move away from a max deal after this contract plays out. Great defender, great passer, solid from 3, horrible inside the arc so far. Get to average from there and he's Jrue Holiday plus 3 inches."
"I went to the Knicks/Bucks game at MSG.  Giannis had 3 points at halftime, not exactly what you hope to see as a neutral fan who spent money on tickets to see Giannis do crazy stuff.  Middleton was out that game.  He was the only other dynamic threat on that team.  Jrue Holiday is a solid, but unspectacular player.  So the Knicks just keyed in on Giannis the whole game, who had no room to operate.  He really needs Middleton to help pull defensive attention away."
Good in the context of Steph isn’t anywhere in the realm of a Giannis or other elite big men though. Steph could be Jrue Holiday level on D and still not impact the game close to the level the Freak could

Sooooo what you’re saying is Jrue Holiday is an overrated defender?
You still have all defensive teamer Jrue Holiday. It's time to stop the excuses
This is with all defensive teamer Jrue Holiday guarding him btw  Gentle reminder: The apologies need to be as loud as the disrespect was
"&gt;Come on People hunt Steph all the time. He's perfectly fine for a PG, but he's not a good defender.  Steph Curry is actually a pretty good defender, the only reason he's hunted is because he was surrounded by 4 all nba level defender in Green, Klay, Iggy and KD.  You could put KCP or Lowry in that lineup and they would still be  hunted by the likes of Harden, Lillard, Kyrie etc. Modern NBA offenses systematically target the weakest link in the opposing teams defense but that doesnt automatically imply your a bad defender just because you get targeted, if the weakest link in your defense is steph curry then you're doing pretty good.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Guards just don't have that much impact on your defense in the modern NBA - that's why Klay missing doesn't matter   Tell that to Jrue Holiday or Marcus Smart lol, Jrue defense on CP3 was one the biggest reasons the bucks beat the suns  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The vast majority of modern defense is scheme + having mobile big men that can protect the rim and so play high in the PnR.   But guys who can execute a wide variety of defensive schemes are known as impactful defenders, having strong defensive anchors are obviously important but you still need high level perimeter defenders if you want your defense to hold up against high level offensive teams. You can have AD anchoring your defense and it wouldn't matter if he's surrounded by the like of JR Smith or Luke Kennard"
"Giannis choked a lead. Bucks said ayt, we're sending a boatload of picks for Jrue Holiday, grabbing Crazy Eyes and getting PJ Tucker."
Jrue Holiday but better in every way except 3pt shooting.
"No. It's already a dumb idea comparing eras but I'll just say that I would never take GP1 over PG in today's game. PG is already built for the modern game, a switchable wing that can shoot the 3 at a high clip. GP1 was just an okay shooter and you can argue he'd have more practice but people never take into account that perimeter defense was literal dog**** back then, with teams actually happy when you take an open 3 over an open midrange. A guy like Jrue Holiday puts up similar points per 100 (and minute adjusted) as GP2 but on higher efficiency and can shoot the 3, he's also far more experienced preparing for modern defenses. Modern defenses is a lot more complex than the 90. Unless GP1 turns out to be some elite shooter if he hypothetically played in this era, I'm taking PG 100% of the time. And there's other top 10-20 players that have similar arguments. The reality is competition is tougher in modern era more physical freaks."
"Maybe top 60? He would be similar to Jrue Holiday, idk where most people rank Jrue, top 50 at the highest I would imagine"
"Same reason CP3 and AD wanted out, the same reason they singed Asik to 5/50mil, the exact same reason they couldnt get a single starting level wing for 6 years while AD was there. It happens to be the reason why they gave Solomon Hill 4/50mil or how they traded Jrue Holiday for a horrible fit center, a rental who didnt want to be there and 2 late first round picks, which happens to be the same reason they gave 3rd string level center in Avidja 4/20mil contract. And that reason is the same reason why they traded down from the #4 pick to the #10 to get yet another horrible fit center with dogshit attitude, who plays progressively less mintes every year. Utter and complete incompetence."
At this point I’m confident in saying that Jrue Holiday is a better defender than Damian Lillard.
Reminds me of a bigger Jrue Holiday
"AD made it out of the first round while the second best player on his team was out with a torn Achilles. He swept a 50 win Blazers team while being the lower seed, with his only competent teammates being Jrue Holiday and an old Rondo. Lowry, Derozan, Beal, Booker, Wall etc have never done anything remotely close to that."

"I can’t tell if this is joking or not, in which case this is a whoosh moment for me. But in case it’s serious, then I’ll say this:  Just going off of PG defenders you can easily say jrue holiday and Marcus smart are better defenders, as well as dunn. FVV is probably better as well defensively. Beverly.   If you expanded it to guards in general then obviously LU dort and thybulle overtake steph as well.   Steph is a good defender but there are better PG and guard defenders in the league for sure."
"And jrue holiday, mike conley, and patrick beverly. Didnt face a single healthy PG in 2015"
You are correct and jrue holiday is just too tough to score on
"Jrue ""Brain Fart"" Holiday"
Celtics in a battle with Jrue Holiday and Bucks bench at home
"I do and I can also remember thinking Holiday was going to be a beast as he popped off a bit in a playoff series vs Boston in 2012.   Even though BOS won that series, Jrue was a difference maker that year for Philly.  Also, that series was awesome to watch as a basketball fan.  One of my favorite things in sports is listening to athletes talk about underrated/lesser known players.  KD and Iggy showing that much respect for Jrue’s game is pretty awesome, and it shows that stats don’t always necessarily reflect a player’s impact.  As I mentioned before, that playoff series back in 2012 really gave me a glimpse of the kind of player that Jrue would eventually be.  I’ve always enjoyed watching him play, and it also helps that he’s a great person."
"Steph was Doritos ankles for the longest time.  And Jrue Holiday was that guard with potential who kept getting stress fractures.  Bledsoe was that mini-Lebron athlete couldn't keep a meniscus intact.   It's hard for me too to see these guys as ""old"" now."
"Handchecking has always been legal, you just need the reputation of a good defender and you're golden  Jrue Holiday, Kawhi, Marcus Smart handcheck more than people did in the 90s, Kawhi especially in the DPOY years his signature defending move was to put his massive hand on someone at all time"
"He'll always be exploitable due to his frame but someone claimed that during the 2018 WCF, the Rockets had a lower offensive rating when they tried to attack Curry.   Now he is capable of playing stellar defense for a point guard. Its not Jrue Holiday or Davion Mitchell or even CP3 levels but he clearly gives effort. Stark contrast to other offensive juggernaut guards.  If you watched that game against the Hawks, he dogged that team on defense for some reason."
"Lmao. Just look at the list bro. You can’t just look at the top 5 exclude everyone you don’t like and just go  “Well that looks alright”  The list a fucking mess of weird shit. Brandon Davis is ranked above KD who is somehow ranked 21. Jrue Holiday is ranked over Nash, Kidd, Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis.  You know who else is ranked over Davis? Nene. Fucking Nene is ranked above Anthony Davis.  And that’s just with a click glance at the top 30."
Disagree. First of all Jrue holiday is better than brandom ingram so...
"Even worse than that-- an Ace pitcher only sees the game every 3rd or 4th game, so their ability to affect the success of the team is limited. Additionally, the games are so much more low scoring that the variance in outcomes is much higher. That's why the best teams in baseball win 60% and the worst teams win 40% of their games. There's just so much more variability and a single player can only improve things so much.   The most impactful recent trades in the NBA was Jrue Holiday, AD, or Kawhi, all of whom essentially were the missing piece to help their team win the title."
"Part of it is that the salary cap, guaranteed salaries, and salary matching requirements for NBA trades basically mean there will ALWAYS be players moving on both sides of a trade. Not necessarily true for MLB or NFL. Since that's the floor of the trade, you start seeing picks get tacked on in order to make the side trading away the ""better"" player(s) feel like it's balanced.   The Lakers needed multiple players on smaller contracts to match Westbrook's contract, and since Washington had the leverage in that situation (and was perceived as getting three nickles for their quarter), picks were tossed in.  Add to that, the ability of one elite player to change a team in the NBA where rosters are smaller and fewer players are on the court versus the other two where teams are larger and there are more active players on any given night. So going all in for someone that can dramatically change your scheme and your success rate (like Jrue Holiday or Anthony Davis) is a smaller gamble."
man I wish we could get jrue holiday or boogie
"well, I think there are teams where you can hide him on defense well enough. those teams would not be the warriors or wolves though, he would have to be paired with a lock up D, off ball guard like Jrue holiday or…Klay. not easy to come by but i could see that being ideal for DLo"
"And KD didn’t do anything in the playoffs without Russ when he was hurt. KD also played bad games and took shit shots in that finals series. KD has as much blame for 2016 as Russ too.   You bring up the ring like thats the only thing that matters. Jrue Holiday has a ring and he’s not better than Russ. Raptors ONLY got that because of Kawhi and Klay/KD going down. Kawhi was FMVP. Not Lowry.   Russ is much more impactful for his teams. He’s a better scorer and finisher. Has a better Vorp and PER.   Lowry’s best year is 22ppg and a career 14ppg. Hell, he’s barely at 10ppg this year and Russ still has a better PER."
"they need to draft better and pick up value among free agents. Milwaukee gets a lot of props for Giannis and Middleton. I would say the Timberwolves are not significantly worse than that first year of Middleton/Giannis. The problem is that it is easy to say ""sign the next Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis, draft the next DiVincenzo and Connaughton, trade and long term sign for the next Jrue holiday "" but it is quite difficult to do.  &amp;#x200B;  If I were them I would target Christian Wood as he only has next year on his deal, see what it would take to get Jerami Grant on the team, see what you could get for Rubio. They really need to hit at least two home run signings.  &amp;#x200B;  If they do trade KAT they need to get a mountain of picks back and hit on almost every one of them"
"&gt; My point was that you're being dense if you really believe there are no non-all star players the 6ers could get that help them. They are literally 1 piece away from being a contender RIGHT NOW.  So again, who are these above average pass-first PGs that are available and would work in a deal for Simmons?  &gt; but you can't really act like Jrue was a proven player before he went to the Bucks.   Just because you didn't know anything about Jrue Holiday doesn't mean nobody knew anything about Jrue Holiday, friend.  &gt; You underrate how good Embiid is. He was 2nd in MVP voting last year and if he played more games he may have actually won it.   He would have, but he didn't. Also, when was the last time a team won the championship whose second best player was of the caliber of Seth Curry?  &gt; He doesn't need another superstar, just like how the Suns and Bucks did not.  Your argument is that Giannis/Middleton/Holiday is a similar caliber lineup as Embiid/Seth Curry/Tobias Harris? Or, to your (unrealistic) example, Embiid/Rubio/Curry? Really? Same with CP3/Booker/Ayton?  I don't really care to debate the definition of the term ""superstar"", but I also never said he needed a superstar. I said mediocre role players wouldn't cut it, which is pretty objectively true. Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are both a tier above ""role player"" even if they're a tier or two below ""superstar"".   &gt; If Morey can't find a trade for a non-all star like Jrue or some other player like him, and the 6ers don't win a chip with him doing whatever the fuck he's trying to do, I think we gotta reconsider if he's that good of a GM...  I _again_ ask where these players are that are of the caliber of Jrue Holiday that are available for Simmons? I think you're really underrate Jrue Holiday. Like a lot."
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
"&gt; DRose, Brogdon, KCP, Dinwiddie, Smart, Rubio, Rozier, Conley, or even Lonzo Ball - all these guys are guards who definitely can contribute to a winning team, and you wouldn't need to give up more than just Simmons, at worst add a depth player or pick, to get even 2 of them.  I'd be surprised to find any of these players were being offered for Simmons. For a bunch of reasons.  &gt; All of those guys move the needle for the 6ers just like Jrue Holiday was the difference the Bucks needed to win a championship.  Milwaukee gave up Eric Bledsoe and some picks and got an elite defensive guard to be their 3rd-4th option. Do you think that a 4th option moves the needle for the sixers? Seriously?"
I'd rather have Wiggins than:  John Wall  Russell Westbrook  Tobias Harris  Pascal Siakam  Ben Simmons  Jrue Holiday  Kristaps Porzingis  D'Angelo Russell  Gordon Hayward  List goes on
Jrue Holiday?
"LEBRON JAMES' ARRIVAL in July 2018 upended Ingram's role, as it did for every Laker. Ingram would play more off the ball. The Davis trade rumors overwhelmed the team starting in December. Ingram knew he would be part of any Davis deal. Even so, he averaged 18 points before the discovery of a blood clot in his right arm ended his season in March 2019.  ""The [trade rumors] were tough on him,"" said Josh Hart, Ingram's teammate in both L.A. and New Orleans. ""Before LeBron got there, he had been given the keys. And then people in L.A. were killing him: He's not as good anymore. He's not a great No 2. pick. The rumors became part of our lives, all year. Thank god I don't have to deal with that s--- anymore.""  Ingram and Stackhouse discussed how Ingram might fit in New Orleans months before the trade. When it happened, Stackhouse predicted Ingram would excel. ""You're in a place that fits you -- more similar to where you grew up,"" Stackhouse said. ""He was collateral damage, but in a good way. I was ecstatic.""  Ingram's father feels no resentment toward the Lakers, or regret about his son's path.  ""If we went back to draft day, I wouldn't have it any other way,"" Donald Ingram said. ""The L.A. experience helped him become a man.""  On Ingram's first day in New Orleans, Fred Vinson, an assistant with expertise in shooting mechanics, introduced himself and went right into a lecture. He said he knew Ingram was entering a contract year, and warned the organization would hold his poor shooting -- about 33% on 3s, 66% at the line -- against him. Vinson said he would be in the Pelicans' gym the next morning if Ingram wished to work.  Ingram showed up. Vinson told Ingram he was pointing his right foot inward upon his release, sapping power from his legs and throwing his body out of alignment -- another voice offering to repair Ingram's game. Vinson slapped tape onto the floor and would not let Ingram shoot unless his toes were straight across the tape. Vinson stood behind Ingram, reaching his arms up, warning Ingram not to bring the ball back so far as to hit him.  Ingram and the other young players then left for some summer time away from the team. He asked Vinson for notes and drills to do. Vinson emailed them.  When Ingram returned in September 2019, his jumper looked so good, Vinson pulled aside Trajan Langdon, the Pelicans' GM, and asked if Ingram had played some sort of trick on him, officials recalled.  On road trips, Ingram asked Vinson to arrange for a gym to be ready for him to shoot when the Pelicans landed. Ball started joining them. In 5-on-5 portions of practice, Ingram sometimes refuses to be subbed out. ""He'll tell me to f--- off and get someone else,"" Hart said.  Ingram tripled his 3-point attempts last season. He hit 39% from deep, and 85% at the line. Vinson wants more: at least seven 3s per game, and more pull-up 3s. Ingram is 12-of-33 on pull-up triples after making just 19 last season. If that becomes a reliable shot, there will be no foolproof scheme for Ingram on the pick-and-roll.  It would help to get Ingram the ball on the move so he is not operating from a standstill. That has been slow going, as Ingram and new teammates hammer out timing. ""He's still a slight player,"" Griffin said. ""If he gets the ball at a dead stop, it doesn't take a lot to keep him from getting momentum.""  Ingram has a nascent post game for use when smaller guys switch onto him, though he needs more force there, too. His defense has improved, in part because the Pelicans have him guarding wings instead of power forwards who can bulldoze him.  Two weeks ago, Stackhouse texted Ingram after one game and suggested he could get lower in his stance. Ingram replied that he agreed, even if he will always be more of an upright defender who makes up ground with length and speed. The Pelicans are on Ingram to stop peeking behind for oncoming screens, and to always find someone to box out.  Quiet by nature, Ingram is easing into a leadership role after showing deference to Jrue Holiday last season. Another 3-on-3 game with special rules required Ingram to shout the name of every teammate he passed to -- a method of bringing out his voice.  ""It helped me get comfortable,"" Ingram said.  Ingram is popular in the locker room, and coaches last season began using him as a conduit to deliver messages to Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Jaxson Hayes, and other young players. If they heard it from Ingram, it might carry more weight.  A more outgoing Ingram said he might one day accept more endorsements. His representatives wish he would. ""He's got a beautiful smile, but he's not about that stuff,"" Stackhouse said. ""He just wants to hoop.""  There is still a huge gap between the present and where Ingram thinks he and New Orleans can go one day. Other confidantes have heard Ingram state similarly lofty goals to the one he once told Redick. ""It's almost eerie to hear a kid say, 'I want to be the best ever,'"" Stackhouse said.  The Pelicans are 5-7, their roster a bit of a mish-mash. But Ingram's belief is unwavering.  ""I know,"" Ingram said, ""that we are building something special here."""
"That doesn’t make sense.   Giannis ranks among the top in the league at 1-on-1 defenders for bigs in the entire league. You can say he isn’t a special perimeter defender, but as a 1-on-1 defender for 4/5’s in the league he clearly ranks among the best.   To call him “about average” because he isn’t an amazing perimeter defender would be like trashing Jrue Holiday for not being an amazing low post defender."
"Currently purely looking at statistics, he hasn't been a top 15 player this season YET (he started a bit slow). But he's played much better in the last week and he should get into top 10-15 range by seasons end. Even then among eastern PGs, it can be argued that only Brogdon, Jrue Holiday and Trae Young are having better seasons (although Kyrie should get into the mix soon)"
"does jrue holiday count? He's elite at certain aspects, but i don't consider him a star."
That's unpopular?  They traded Jrue Holiday.
I am all in on the Dort- Jrue Holiday comp
I think Giannis is underrated as a playmaker but shouldn't be the #1. luckily Khris has bumped up his assist numbers from 4 to 5.5 and Imo Jrue Holiday is better than good but worse than elite so Imo there set on playmaking
"Jrue Holiday is very good, as well as the fact that I don’t expect the Bucks to make the same mistakes they did last year. Also, Miami lost Jae Crowder who was instrumental in defending Giannis"
"Was revisiting old NBA content I listened to when i was getting into the NBA, circa 2014-15 and I have 2 random Process thoughts:   1. My god what a nightmare to tank and bet all the chips for the 13, 14 and 15 drafts, 13 they absolutely bet on the wrong guys in a bad top 5 draft (MCW in the long term, I know he won ROTY), 15, its Hinkie's worst pick in a draft, and 14 was just a landmine of hurt and coming-up-short guys. Getting Embiid wasn't just their best pick, it was the process saving pick, if they had taken Exum or Vonleh or whoever, they're low key fucked. They did eventually get to the 16 draft but what a terrible slate of years to tank in  2. Tearing down that overachieving Collins team to tank was correct, and they got decent returns. But my god, in hindsight, what a trainwreck the Jrue Holiday trade is. They traded an All Star, All D guard who was only 23 (so he would've been 27-28 for the 18 playoff team, not at all incompatible), and of course hindsight _but still!_ but got Noel who was basically a nothing who wasn't good enough to play over or with Embiid, and eventually Saric, who was fine but not nearly the same value. I'll grant you, Hinkie did get his '17 1st back with the Payton-Saric trade, but the value gained from the Jrue trade, when you easily could've just kept him and pocketed him as a young cornerstone, ages poorly  Ademdum: you also could've used Holiday's injury history to both keep tanking and get a more team friendly extension. This is all with hindsight but hindsight is fun"
jrue holiday &gt;&gt;&gt;
"It annoys me most that he's making the assumption that the Bucks traded him because he led the wildcat strike in the playoffs. No, they traded him to get a great player in Jrue Holiday. The whole team rallied around Hill in the bubble and is still very outspoken about social issues."
Unlike George Hill who has been bashing the Bucks ever since the Jrue Holiday trade LOL
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
Jrue Holiday is one of the best point guards in the east so you clearly don’t know what you’re talking about
"Seriously, since when is it a controversial opinion to think Kyrie Irving is a better player than Jrue Holiday? This sub is fucking nuts sometimes, lol."
"Lakers are probably a better matchup for the bucks because their paint defense is great (though the lakers 3 point shooting has been deadly so far)   Jrue holiday and Co. aren’t even that bad of perimeter defenders, but the bucks defensive system allows for a lot of 3 pointers which isn’t great against a team with KD, Harden, Kyrie, Harris, among other great shooters."
Jrue holiday is so good on defense
Jrue Holiday is really good
I feel like every year I say Jrue Holiday is the most underrated player in the league
Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday wasn't an all star with New Orleans.  Smh
I've never liked Jrue Holiday. And everyone seems to love him.
Did Jrue Holiday forget that he’s a good basketball player? He’s too passive
Jeez jrue holiday is such a good defender
"I think both teams are very happy. If zion didn’t have a set back medically and miss a lot of last year (does not mean he’s injury prone) then he probably would have been rookie of year if you just look at the regular season games he played.  I love both, I wish the pels would have traded jrue holiday and #4 to Memphis for the #2 pick last year."
"Well, Jrue Holiday isn't carrying a team to a title either. Your second point is true, but ""who is a better player"" and ""who would you rather have on your team"" aren't the same question."
"Giannis and AD are locks. I think Marcus smart will get there. Normally I think ben is a better defender than smart, but Ben's kinda in hot water and if this narrative keeps up I could see someone like Jrue holiday or PG-13 over him. I think Bam or Embiid get it over gobert this year."
Doesn't want that Jrue Holiday smoke.
"I mean, yes &amp; no.  Now with the zone defense rules coverages are more complex and you have to play great team defense to thrive, it's still a big part of the game, just in a different form.  Also, it makes the accomplishments of a Jrue Holiday or Marcus Smart that much more impressive, they're putting the clamps on dudes nightly without actually being able to physically put the clamps on them."
"Think about it another way.  How many picks would Ben Simmons be worth he Morey decided to trade him alone?  Jrue Holiday, who is 30, just went for 2 firsts and 2 swaps, so you’d have to think Simmons would go for at least 3 and 3.  So the Rockets were asking for 3 first plus a guy worth 3 firsts plus additional players.  That’s way more than they got from the nets."
"Agree - there is a chance the Nets completely implode and a couple of those picks end up being great. But its unlikely, and even if they do implode, the picks could still be in the back half of the top 10. KD and Harden are likely going to be leading the Nets to playoff births for the next 3-4 years minimum.  Adding it all up:  Simmons by himself is obviously worth more than 3 first rounders - Jrue Holiday was traded for 3 firsts and his contract expires next year. Maxey's worth at least a first rounder.   The demands from Philly and Boston just seem so much higher than what Brooklyn ended up paying."
"He's 1st in the league in [DFG%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100).  His defensive rating is [102](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747) which is better than Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embid, aka literally every other player except Rudy Gobert listed on Op's all-defense teams.  &gt;He's actually not in the top 20 for DBPM  Wrong he is 17th. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html"
"Because you outscored them due to unsustainable shooting lmao. Not because you showed literally any ability to stop them.   You had a 115 DRTG last playoffs (120 against the Jazz). Both of those marks would have ranked last in the entire league for the regular season.    It's called Pick and Roll man. The ball handler has a huge advantage in it. That's why it's the most used play in basketball. Unless you have a marcus smart or Jrue holiday tier player, they're likely not going to be able to do shit about it but go over the screen and try to contest from behind  That's why it's so important for bigs to be able to defend the PnR. Jokic can't. Gobert can't (it's why people say he isn't worth his deal). Jokic just makes up for it with offense."
6 draft picks for James Harden is nothing...Jrue Holiday got 5 himself lmao
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
Simmons will imo be a Lonzo Ball/Jrue Holiday/Kevin Love type player on a contender.  He just doesn’t have the all around game to be a 1st/2nd option.
"A player not scoring and a player being worth 3 1st round picks are not mutually exclusive. Simmons is a young all-nba/allstar, 1st team all-defence star. Pelicans got 2 1st round picks and 2 future 1st round swaps along with Adams n Bledsoe for Jrue Holiday the 60th pick and a bunch of bench guys."
AD got outplayed by Jrue Holiday in his only playoff series win before without Lebron LOL
For players all currently in the league I can think of   Jrue Holiday  Justise Winslow  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid
It’s not the fans it’s the FO  Report came out a few weeks ago MPJ was one of the young players houston had targeted as wanting. Look the package houston took for harden they could’ve gotten at any time the reason they waited this long is they wanted a coveted young player and a bunch of picks they didn’t get what they wanted. Zach lowe even said if Denver had been willing to throw in MPJ presumably they could’ve been a legit bidder for him. The package houston took was basically the Jrue holiday package plus one pick two swaps and a better expiring. If Denver offers MPJ that alone is way better than any asset in that. You offer MPJ and like 2 unprotected future firsts your giving houston what they said they wanted to a better degree than what they ended up taking. Denver was never even a bidder for harden no buzz at all which in and of itself is bad
"I mean I’d argue the Pelicans team with AD, Boogie, Rondo, Jrue Holiday, and Mirotic is better than any supporting cast Harden had other than maybe the CP3 team that went to 7 games with GS."
Jrue Holiday &gt;
"He is just built solid in addition to his effort and IQ and skill/footwork. He kind of reminds of Dwade in body type. I think the other very good example is Jrue Holiday. Strong, long and a lot of skill and effort. It helps when you don't have to do too much on offense, i feel like there are a lot of guys with similar body types and potential but just have to do much more on offense."
"The thing I don’t get is giving Adams that contract is a win now move, but if you were planning on trying to win and compete now then why trade Jrue Holiday for a worse player in Bledsoe? Makes no sense  I love watching Ingram though"
I would add JRue Holiday in there too.   Levert is going to be a perfect fit for the Pacers.

"How can he be if not given the opportunity to play point.  At no point in his career have he been the point allowed to make mistakes learn and get comfortable.  La first year isaih Thomas,  second year lebron and rondo Third year jrue holiday and BI and bi is the point guard,  this year BI bledsoe. Come on now."
"I think it is important to also have a high level of anticipation/feel for guarding the ball handler, and for the other defender to give a soft hedge. Watching Milwaukee tonight, jrue holiday is great getting through screens as well but it seems like he pressures the ball handler heavier when a screen is coming, giving him more room to get around the screen. Specifically the last few possessions guarding Luka, he did a great job staying in front, even through a screen.   Either way, Dort is going to run through the screener if he doesn’t have room to get around him lol."
"PG is certainly better right now but you could have acquired other players with all those picks, eg. Jrue Holiday, and had Shai and Kawhi still."
So give credit for Jrue Holiday for forcing that rather than shitting on Doncic
Mans is boutta fetch us the Jrue Holiday package of assets /s
"bruh POST UP LUKA, jrue holiday is one of the best guard defenders in the league but luka has at least 3-4 inches on him    edit: the second I say that they do it and dropstep layup, no shit"
Can we stop fucking ignoring Jrue Holiday on offense????????????
It is INFURIATING that fucking Thanisis is more involved with the offense than Jrue Holiday.
"That has literally nothing to do with my point.   I said AD's case was different because his best teammate was Jrue Holiday. They never put pieces around him. Unlike Harden, who got to choose which stars his team went after only to toss them a couple years later."
"Jrue is a way better slasher and more versatile defender than CP3, CP3 still gives up size and strength in comparison to Jrue who’s 6’4 and basically can do switch 1-4 if need be... Holiday and Harden make up for each other strength and weakness really well in that sense"
Jrue Holiday and James Harden are my dream backcourt I hope it happens one day. Syngery wise it’s a match made in heaven
"I'm not downvoting you but yup, it is an important caveat. Your argument would be exactly the same if it were about Marcus Smart or Jrue Holiday.  Betts is in an elite MLB tier that consists of basically him and Trout. Jokic is great but he's not that. You make it sound like you're comparing Betts and Jokic but you're not, you're comparing MLB to NBA."
Was the news that Jrue Holiday can play D?
"Their worst matchups in my opinion are the Lakers, Bucks, Clippers and Sixers (in that order) and theres a world where they have to face 3 of these teams in one playoff run. Their biggest problem, at least in my opinion, is rim protection so its important to look at the teams that will feast at the rim.  The Lakers will absolutely be able to feast against the Nets at the rim and it gets even worse when you think about the minutes where they will have to have a backup center in the game going up against Monrezl Harrell. Can you really trust a guy like Claxton against not only Harrell but against the other players coming off the bench for the Lakers. Not to mention that Lebron/AD will be playing most of the game and theres nobody on the team that can defend AD at all. Tough matchup for the Nets and I feel that they would have a better time in next years playoffs if its against the Nets.  On the Bucks it is entirely possible that Jrue, Giannis, and Khris work together to contain James or Kyrie and negate some of the guard offense that Brooklyn will be reliant on, but even if they don't there isn't anyone on the team who can stop Giannis. They're going to have to build an even tighter wall than we've ever seen and this will allow Middleton and Holiday to put up big numbers. This is a series where Deandre Jordan could foul out easily in every single game and leave the Nets scrambling for extra paint defense. Honestly an incredibly tough matchup, but one where I can see the Nets coming out on top because of their absolutely insane offensive potential.  The Clippers have as ideal of a lineup as you can ask for against a team with an elite offensive PG, SG, and forward. Beverley, PG, and Kawhi on Kyrie, Harden, and Durant is about as good as you're going to find in the league and with a guy like Serge Ibaka backing them up that's going to at least present a bigger challenge for the Nets than 95% of teams can present. The issue with the Clippers is honestly the same with the Nets. Both teams are going to be reliant on guys who disappear in the playoffs, guys who are prone to injury and on a team with guys who understand the heaps of pressure being put on them. The Clippers and Lakers being the two western favorites is pretty much the least ideal situation Brooklyn could ask for.  The 76ers are basically the anti-Nets. They're super defensive and play above the rim. Theres a world where Simmons is on KD, and then you figure the rest out from there, with Embiid locking up the paint. Who can guard Embiid on this team? This is a series where Dwight Howard can actually put up 10 pts, 10 rebs off the bench and Shake can average 13-16 ppg off the bench. I would bet the house on the Nets winning this series but there is a world where we see the Sixers looking completely unstoppable at the rim.  I would bet on the Nets getting to the finals and losing, then looking better next year after getting more front court depth."
"Jrue Holiday was injured with the pelicans.  Cousins played maybe a season with them they made the playoffs but Cousins went out with a major injury.   Mirotic played a total of 60 games with the pelicans, 30 games in one season and 30 games in another.   Wood played 8 games with the pelicans.   Elfrid Payton is trash.   Holy crap you literally listed players without any context lmao wtf."
"&gt; I mean did the New Orleans organization really do enough to build around AD?  They traded for an All-NBA Center so he could play the 4 more? Also got Jrue Holiday.  They certainly didn't do enough, but they didn't exactly do nothing."
"Is Lowry &gt; Danny Green + Maxey in terms of impact, not just this year, but in future years going forward? That's the question Morey's gotta ask himself. I like Maxey a lot, he's going to be good, can envision him being the next Jrue Holiday, or at the very least, better Eric Bledsoe.   A 2-for-1 swap leaves you with a 9-man rotation of:  Starting 5: Lowry/Shake/Simmons/Harris/Embiid   Bench: Seth/Korkmaz/Thybulle/Dwight  That's a damn good team and has higher upside than the current team does right now."
"J Holiday underrated af. Never leaves a man unattended and pulls up rarely missed clutch 3’s whenever opponents start to shift momentum. He and Aaron always find each other seamlessly, almost like they have played together their entire lives.   Jrue, wya b? Mom and dad are tired of traveling. Come play nice with your brother’s."
"I feel that way some days, other days I see victor Oladipo and 7 picks vs DeRozan, Poetl, and 1 pick. I like our young guys. I'm just disappointed because teams get so much more for so much less. Rudy couldn't grab a first from someone who needs a 4? LMA couldn't get us a late first last year when he was making his 3s? Of course we don't know. I don't think the Lakers deal was real because they felt they would get him in FA. It just makes me sad because we traded a top 5 player for way less than Jrue Holiday."
Same guy who shit talked and got swept by jrue holiday?
"Not entirely true. At one point the pelicans had Jrue holiday, AD, Demarcus cousins when he was the best center in the league, rondo, nikola mirotic. That team was derailed by injuries, but still swept Portland in the first round and lost to the warriors. They fell apart and cousins didn’t resign cause he thought they didn’t offer him enough, that had a lot to do with AD leaving. We never even got to see what those guys could really do together. It’s ok though cause I like our current team better.   Also ad was here for 7 years"
"so you really think that jeff green, austin rivers, ben mclemore, danuel house, etcetc are better than Jrue Holiday, pLaYoFf RoNdO, Boogie, etc?  &amp;#x200B;  or that harden shoulda been able to do more with an injured russ or an injured cp3? lmao harden did way more for the rockets than AD did for the pelicans"
"&gt; Harden is a player the fans love a lot more than GMs. There's no way you give up someone like Michael Porter, Jaylen Brown, etc. for him. I'm willing to bet there's at least partial relief in Philly that they're keeping Simmons.  This all comes back to are you serious about wanting to win a title or not. Or are you cool with just being a good small market team who won’t part with guys like Michael Porter Jr and then whine about how the league is so unfair to small market teams and they can never win? I’m not referring to you specifically I’m talking about these teams. Because not being willing to trade any of these guys for harden is code word for you aren’t serious about wanting to win a title. Title windows don’t last 5-10 years in the nba they last 2-3 and you retool and regroup. If you aren’t willing to live with the fact you’ll only get a 2-3 year title window again it just means you aren’t serious   About the harden choker thing this all comes back to expectations and price. Harden gets held to superstar expectation: if you hold Jaylen MPJ Simmons etc to those expectations at any point in their career you’ll be far more critical of them. And then finally it’s about price you aren’t giving up the price associated with a superstar. You are giving up basically one more pick and a better expiring than the Jrue holiday price. So when that’s the price it doesn’t matter if harden underperforms vs GSW relative to top 3 superstars. You aren’t giving up close to that kind of value here   Which if an owner just wants a good team and doesn’t want to take risks ok. But this is what being serious about wanting to win a title means it means taking a level of risk to get a substantially better player than any of those guys you mentioned will ever be. None of those teams are in great title positions right now they are all just in the tier of always being good to very good"
"&gt;Fans will have long moved on by the time anything in the Harden trade ends up panning out and no one will really remember.  Yeah this is another good point and way of looking at it, if your trying to dupe a fan base then this is another good approach, there's no actual accountability. Tillman may very well have sold off the team by 2029 or whenever those last picks can be properly evaluated and people can realize damn what a joke this trade was.   We've gotten to the point where people have overcorrected for the ""never trade an unprotected pick no matter what!"" type takes. Being cautious about unprotected picks is cool when it's a washed Paul Pierce/KG or even Jrue Holiday........unprotected picks when it comes to trading MVP caliber players in the grand scheme of things dont mean squat unless you know for a fact the team will be atrocious the years you are getting those picks(which you very rarely do)."
 I don't think people realize quite how bad Bledsoe was. He is the definition of a playoff choker. Jrue Holiday will make such a difference for them.
"When I first got into the nba, my parents wouldn’t let me stay up late enough to watch the western conference games so what made me fall in love with the association was the eastern conference circa 2009-2012  Celtics: Loved Watching Rondo facilitate to Kg, Paul, and Ray Bulls: D Rose was an exciting of a player as I’ve ever seen, plus I loved the way Joakim Noah played  Magic: Prime Dwight Howard killing shit with Hedo, Vince Carter, Jameer Nelson, and Ryan Anderson Heat: LeBron, Wade, Bosh were on another level Pacers: Paul George, David West, Roy Hibbert, Lance  Sixers: Young Jrue Holiday and Andre Iguodala  Knicks: Melo and Amari    Even liked watching the not so good teams like the Cavs with Young Kyrie or the Wizards with young John Wall"
Must be so butt hurt he signed that extension to stay with Jrue holiday 🤣
That's why Dwight Howard is making 26 million this year while Jrue Holiday is making league minimum
Only if it were necessary to keep Tatum happy. So like a Celtics version of the Jrue Holiday trade.
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
"Low key a Lakers vs Nets matchup falls on how annoying Caruso and Schroeder can make Kyrie's life. Can't stop him, but can you make him work?  I can even see the Bucks beating them with Jrue Holiday doing Jrue Holiday stuff, just enough to annoy Kyrie and keep the ball out of Harden's hands, which is a win, that's another discussion for another time."
Jrue Holiday
"&gt;AD signed long-term. PG signed long-term. Jrue Holiday is going to sign long-term as soon as he gets the chance. And so will Harden.  Maybe I've just lost all trust in Harden, but are there any sources out there suggesting this is inevitable?  From my POV, Harden played GM with the Rockets, made a lot of shit happen behind the scenes and then bounced when he saw it wasn't going to work out.  How do we know he won't up and leave Brooklyn if he doesn't like the way things are going?  Maybe Marks can keep him happy long enough to re-sign.  I'm not sure.  Seemed like he was happy in Houston until he wasn't all of a sudden."
"it's 1 more FRP and 2 more swaps than Pelicans got for Jrue Holiday, a one time all-star with no all-nba appearances who is also on an expiring deal"
"It's fair for the Rockets to ask for that, and it's fair for the Celtics to say no to doing that deal.   Ultimately, like with all these stars, you give up all the picks when you know the player is signing long-term. AD signed long-term. PG signed long-term. Jrue Holiday is going to sign long-term as soon as he gets the chance. And so will Harden.   And what all 4 of those teams have in common is they already had a Tier 1 player on board, the Lakers have LeBron, the Bucks had Giannis, the Nets had KD, and the Clippers had Kawhi's commitment if they made the PG trade. They also know that all 4 of those players (LeBron, KD, Giannis, Kawhi) are likely not going to go anywhere long-term, Kawhi is the only question mark, and does anybody really think he is going to leave Los Angeles? Giannis could ask out for a trade in the future, but why would he sign the super-max in the first place if he didn't want to stay there? At the very least, he will be in Milwaukee for a few more years and they will get all the draft pick compensation from somebody else in the same way they just gave away with Jrue. The other players don't really seem likely to leave Los Angeles or New York."
"Jrue Holiday didn't ask for a trade, and Pels only got a huge package because Bucks were somewhat desperate, and Jrue is probably the best non-superstar second option for Giannis.  Also, Herro alone worth around 2-3 FRPs."
Shouldn't have traded all your picks for Jrue Holiday then. shit all those picks + Middleton would've probably gotten them Harden
"I think patbev should be classified as a small guard, jrue holiday a power guard. KD is a shooting forward"
"It’s ok Giannis doesn’t want to win anyway. If he did, he wouldn’t have stayed with the bucks and asked for Jrue freaking Holiday."
"When you compare the return Houston got to the return NOP got for Jrue Holiday it puts in perspective how wild it is. Talking 1 extra first, 2 extra pick swaps and a better expiring contract for a guy who's never made an All NBA team vs a guy who finishes top 3 in MVP voting every single season. Still cant believe nobody in the NBA was willing to beat that BRK offer petty Tillman's not trading Harden to where he wanted to go if he couldve avoid it"
"Jrue Holiday... 2 1st round picks 2 1st round pick swaps, Adams, bledsoe on an expiring."
It's just insane to me when you compare it to the Jrue Holday compensation Jrue Holiday got 3 picks(2 unprotected) 2 pick swaps George Hill and Eric Bledsoe while James Harden got 4 unprotected picks 4 swaps and Victor Oladipo. I dont buy the leverage thing either everybody knew NOP wanted to trade Jrue last offseason also.   The Denver thing to me you just cant pass up an opportunity like this at this price if you are a small market team. If MPJ or Murray are off the table in a Harden discussion it just means you arent actually serious about trying to win a title.
I fully agree with the “you don’t get kyrie on the court without kyrie off the court”. Except I don’t think that Jrue Holiday is the closer/bucket getter on a championship team  Edit: Jrue Holiday is definitely an upgrade from Bledsoe in the half court but Kyrie would be a giant upgrade from Jrue
That's what I'm saying. 3 late firsts makes sense as a swing for a guy like Jrue Holiday. You expect significantly more in return for a top 5-10 player.   You really expect something closer to the AD trade where you get a nice mix of young players + picks.
People really acting like they don’t have jrue holiday and kris Middleton
Pels even got a AD style haul for Jrue Holiday.
Exactly. You guys gave up 3 firsts for jrue holiday.. I don't see this as a haul at all.
Jrue holiday got three firsts.   I would be expecting a haul closer to AD for Harden tbh.
"Is it though?  They don't want LeVert (who they turned around and flipped to Ind for a rental of Oladipo).  So its basically 4 1sts and 4 swaps, at least 2 swaps are guaranteed to be useless- and likely more b/c Hou is unlikely to be good 3 years from now.  Plus a starter in Jarrett Allen, who could have trouble playing with Wood.  The 1sts are a total question mark.  But Bkn is going to be a fuckton better than they were with KG and Pierce- who were already breaking down.  It's roughly similar to the Jrue Holiday haul."
"I just said he’s all star talent  Not everyone with all star talent is an all star  (CJ McCollum, Jrue Holiday, Lavine) not that I’m saying he’s better than any of those guys."
"Holiday season for Curry...first he victimizes Jrue some days ago,  now he targets the rest of the family..."
"If I'm looking for a #2 to LBJ, 100% yes and it's not even close.  If I'm looking for a #1 to lead a team, I would say it's close between peak Wade and peak AD. AD is a bigger impact on defense, Wade is much better at getting his own shot, but AD is by far the better 3P shooter.  It's hard to make the argument for AD leading a team but he never had any All-NBA level talent to play beside him in NO. Jrue Holiday is the only teammate he had to ever make an All-Star team (once) other than Boogie who had serious injuries to the point where his tenure didn't really count."
Jrue holiday on dame a few years back
Jrue is also the first player in NBA history named Jrue Holiday and the first ever Jrue Holiday to have multiple 25/10 games for a single Bucks franchise
"AD didnt want to be there so in the context of trading one year of AD playing with a rookie zion and Jrue Holiday (maybe a fifth seed in the west) it was absolutely a win.   they got a solid pg, an all star wing, a good role player, a fourth overall pick, and the potential to have any Lakers pick from 2022-2025 which with Lebrons age and AD’s injury history will have a chance to be a high pick one year."
"Two franchises that entered the league together, tied by the red string of fate when they had the coin flip for Kareem. The Bucks won and the Suns got Neal Walk instead.  PJ Tucker, former fan favorite Sun guarding the guy he would rave about in practice (Booker).  Bud and Monty, Bud chose the Bucks over the Suns in 2018.  Torrey Craig, discarded by the Bucks at the deadline, now a contributor on their finals opponent.   Jrue Holiday came to the Bucks in the Bledsoe trade. Bledsoe was only on the Bucks because of his famous “I don’t want to be here” tweet that happened at the nadir of the Suns’ history.  If Donte was healthy you’d have Donte and Mikal, former Villanova teammates now Finals rivals.  And then all of the narratives for individual players like CP3 chasing his first ring. Even without Giannis, the narratives are all there for a compelling series."
"I think the counter is that allows players like Joe Johnson, who are good players but just don’t really pass the smell test for being a hall of famer.  Doesn’t that really dilute whether it means anything at all?   I would argue if Joe Johnson is a hall of famer, players that just prob shouldn’t be in there are a candidate: deandre Jordan? Heck even jrue holiday which in my opinion shouldn’t even sniff it, but isn’t he a better player than Joe Johnson?...amare stoudamire? The list of players just goes on and on when we dilute it like that."
"I still have KAT&gt;. Ik Ayton is a much more balanced 2 way player as he’s both offense/defense and he’s currently in the finals while timberwolves are at the bottom. But here’s my reasoning. In this era, I will always value offense&gt;defense, that’s why I have jokic as the best center in the league and not Bam or Ayton or embiid and that’s why I have Curry as the best point guard in the league and not jrue holiday or Chris Paul. Ayton is an extremely efficient scorer (and I’m not saying this is the only way he can score) but most of his points are coming from standing in the dunker’s spot and having someone drive and give him a wide open layup. Is he good at it? Absolutely but I believe that this wouldn’t work if he was the main option on his team. If this team had no Chris Paul or devin booker, he would be in the same situation as KAT. The thing about KAT is that he’s much more capable of creating his own shot, more so than ayton. If the defense number 1 priority became ayton, and they started double teaming/face guarding him, I’m not sure he’d be able to do anything. That’s just my two cents. Obviously ayton is very good and I’m not taking away what he’s doing"

Jrue Holiday limited edition street wear jersey
Jrue Holiday has talked about how players with reputations for being good defenders get away with way more on defense. Pat Bev definitely benefits from that and because he’s smaller. But that’s not a knock on him imo - he uses it to his advantage
"It feels like people forgot Portis was literally a starter level player, Jrue Holiday is an All-NBA worthy starting guard, Khris Middleton is an All-Star caliber forward, and Brook Lopez is still capable of playing at an elite level, if anything improving his defence since he was an All-NBA post player"
"What are you talking about? This was absolutely without a doubt, one of the basketball games we've seen this playoffs.  Jokes aside, Trae Young is much more integral to Hawks' offense than Giannis is to the Bucks' and it showed. Not sure how the Hawks can bring this back. Even when Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis Jr aren't popping off, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are much more consistent scorings options than anyone on this Hawks team. I just don't see a good answer from the Hawks to the Bucks dominance in the paint either."
"Huh, guess I've never heard Jrue Holiday talk. He's got a nice voice."
"Score one for apocalypse bingo: Brook Lopez dominating the game and leading his team one game away from NBA Finals.   Seriously though, massive respect to Bucks front office for identifying players like Jrue Holiday and Bobby Portis to acquire in the last couple off seasons that have become the X-Factors to them going beyond their previous heights even without Giannis."
"Lol, I don't give a fuck, I want the Bucks to win the title even if they don't have Giannis. What's crazy is, I think they might be able to do it if they can contain CP3. I'm not sure who can defend him better than Jrue Holiday.  Brook Lopez/Jrue Holiday/Khris for finals MVP, fuck it"
"A better question would've been *""How has Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton showed their leadership in the absence of Giannis?""*"
So FMVP....Jrue Holiday or Middleton?
Sarcasm: Jrue Holiday might be the best PG in the NBA  Trolling: Jrue Holiday might be the best PG in the NBA
Who is the buck's MVP today? Brook Lopez or Jrue Holiday?
Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton combined have the dumbest shot selection in the league
"You also have three players shooting what feels like 100% from the field, Jrue Holiday is clamping multiple players already, and you're even getting fantastic defense from Brook Lopez. I think this is realistically the most you can ask for out of these guys."
Imagine having Giannis as your main ball handler instead of Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday really illustrating why Trae is such a better ball handler than Lou Will.   He can barely get it across half court right now
Jrue Holiday finally realized he can bully players in the paint instead of shooting bad jumpers
The bucks looks a lot better when Jrue Holiday is allowed to handle the ball instead of stand around waiting for Giannis to operate from the top of the key.
JrUe HoLiDaY iS bLeDsOe 2.0
Old ass Jrue holiday more physical in the paint than all of Atlanta 😭
this the jrue holiday i know
This is the jrue holiday I know
Hey....it's Jrue Holiday
I don’t think Suggs will be the elite championship-leading PG as Chauncey. He reminds me more of a Jrue Holiday type player.
You mean Jrue Holiday
"Bucks can absolutely still win if Holiday doesn't keep playing like shit but I don't trust him and Bud compared to the Hawks coaching and Jrue ""All Defensive first team best guard defender in the league"" can't lock up Lemon Pepper Lou"
"Honestly, gotta disagree. I feel like he's extremely worth it for teams like the Timberwolves and OKC.    Getting a vet in there that your talented rookies respect enough to listen to, someone who can set team culture standards that players will actually follow, is *incredibly* important.   Say you're the Timberwolves and you're debating picking up Chris Paul or Jrue Holiday. Maybe Jrue will provide more value per dollar on court, but if Jrue tells Ant/D'Lo/KAT to stop playing call of duty and wake up earlier to work out do you think they're going to listen to him? If there's a disagreement over the way to play a matchup defensively, are they going to swallow their pride and defer to Jrue to resolve things? Are they going to spend 2 hours a day in practice learning to run the pick and roll exactly the way Jrue wants them to?    IMO Jrue is the type of player you want on a contender, and CP3 is the kind of player you want next to young talented guys who are still learning how to play winning basketball. The suns just happened to be in both positions at once. For a team that is trying to turn around their culture or build up an identity (which is most rebuilding teams) having a guy like CP3 is great, and their impact can stay around a while even after their contract is up."
"One of E'Twaun Moore, Jrue Holiday, and Solomon Hill will win a Championship after Anthony Davis"
&gt;Jrue Holiday has the capacity to lock down guards like CP3 and Booke  Does he really tho? Trae scored 48 and 11 with him as the primary defender. People overrated the fuck out of 1v1 defense. He may slow them down be he doesn't lock them down by anymeans. People act like that means they're not going to score.
"Bucks. Even without Giannis, Jrue Holiday has the capacity to lock down guards like CP3 and Booker.   I still take the Suns in that series tho, they have much more depth."
"Warriors in 2015  1st round: vs. Pelicans, injured Jrue Holiday  Semi-finals: vs. Grizzlies, injured Mike Conley &amp; Tony Allen   Conf. Finals: vs. Rockets, injured Beverly &amp; Howard  Finals: vs. Cavaliers, injured Kyrie &amp; KLove  and in those same playoffs; they avoided Spurs- defending champs, Clippers- prime lob city, AND Thunder- KD/Russ, ALL powerhouses of the conference, didn’t even play them. Look at the teams they beat: Pelicans, Grizzlies and Rockets 😭 all injured (then a cavs team with Dellavdova as the 2nd best players in the finals.)"
Anyone who puts his defense on the same level as Marcus smart/jrue holiday is a casual. Guy is objectively dirty and the nba let’s him get away with it
Jrue Holiday for New Orleans
"Bucks may not need Giannis to make it a tough series. If Jrue Holiday is in form, he could do damage while locking up CP and Book."
I think bucks would still have a small chance because of their size and athleticism. Plus Jrue Holiday aka Clamps Holiday could lock up either Book or CP. It’d be a tough tough task though
The fact that Reggie Jackson is outperforming Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday these playoffs makes my blood boil lol
Don’t forget they had Rondo and Jrue Holiday in the backcourt. They were the scariest team in the West that year.
Jrue holiday
"Suns have a more consisting and better shooting, and they're a 5 man team offense, and a 5 man team defense. Bucks are not. Ayton wouldn't stop Giannis, but would get less damage than what the rest of the suns can do to the rest of the bucks.  Jrue and Middleton are good but not consistent, suns guards are (they're scoring zero now because they're against the best guard - defense team in these playoffs probably, since all the other top defense teams were top that good because of their big men, but looking at the guards, the clippers have literally the best defense on earth) . And Jrue Holiday can't guard both booker and CP3.  Plus they have Payne and crowder, which I'd say, when it counts, are way better than the other bucks starters.  Clippers crazy defense on the shorts is now simply making people underrate sun's scorers ability to be honest. Suns would - not easily - but they'd have good chances to take on the bucks."
"Exactly.  These people have no idea - they are just regurgitating a narrative.  The Bucks are in just their third year with Bud as a coach. Their first year with Jrue Holiday, for Pete's sake! They spent a bunch of time this season working on new shit.   They are 2-2 in the Eastern final. It's such a silly talking point."
moe harkless/zach collins on AD vs jrue holiday on damian lillard. They dont even matchup so its not “completely outplaying”
"I am not sure that the bucks will beat the hawks. Middleton should be the best player in the series with Trae and Giannis out but he is very inconsistent. I am also not sure that Jrue Holiday can be trusted as well as he can also be inconsistent. If Trae comes back in the series, Atlanta will win the series. Even if trae does not come back, Atlanta can still win this series with the way Huerter and Bogdanovic playing in game 4."
Never said he was but he can fairly easily be hidden on defense majority of the time.  He is however a way better defender than people give him credit for and he isn't the worst defender in the NBA.  He does a good job of playing his role in the scheme and fights thru screens and helps over at appropriate moments. [Like this](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=11&amp;GameID=0042000303&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Holiday%20Offensive%20Charge%20Foul%20(P1)%20(S.Wright)&amp;sct=plot).  He led the entire series for both teams with the Sixers in steals with timely strips of Embiid when helping.  Also Jrue has not been attacking Trae all the time.  A) the eye test doesn't support it. B) [None of the tracking data supports it either](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612737/matchups/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PORound=3&amp;sort=DEF_PLAYER_NAME&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=OFF_PLAYER_NAME*E*jrue).  Sure when they get matched up Jrue does well but it isn't often  Again I ask have you been watching?
"I’m 36 so I grew up watching him and yeah he’s definitely the GOAT. The best way I can describe it is he was just good at every single aspect of the game. He really had no deficiencies. When we think about modern players today, we typically talk about them being the best at ____.  Westbrook/Prime D Rose: Most athletically gifted/first step. Jordan was the most athletic player in the league for nearly his whole career. He could blow by anyone.  LeBron: Amazing court vision and strength. Jordan had that.  Curry/Reggie Miller/Durant/Dirk: Best shooters/shotmaking ability. Jordan had that. Every shot he took you expected it to go in and it just would. I remember watching the Knicks/Bulls ECF in 1993 and MJ just made ridiculous fade aways and crazy shot after shot against one of the toughest defensive teams I’d seen. The only place you could maybe knock him was he was not the best 3 point shooter his whole career. Reggie Miller/Curry have him there, but he had ridiculous 3 point games (see Portland finals lol)   Kobe’s killer instinct: That literally came from emulating MJ. The man left it all on the court and was hyper competitive. If LeBron had this he MIGHT have a chance to surpass Jordan but I don’t see it in him.  Harden: Midrange, drawing fouls, FT shooting. This was Jordan’s bread and butter. Best fade away of all time and literally unguardable. Great FT shooter.   Gary Payton/Jrue Holiday lockdown D: Jordan had that. Won DPOY. Most modern stars don’t play defense really, although the game has changed quite a bit to be more offensively focused.   Lillard: Clutch shooting. Jordan is probably the best clutch shooter of all time. Never afraid to miss.   Kyrie: Best handle/finisher. Jordan’s handle was also nasty, but not Kyrie level. Finishing though MJ could score in any way he wanted around the basket and the “hang time” meant he could literally float in the air and manipulate his body to get the shot or hand he wanted.   As you can see, his game literally has no flaws. All these modern guys are really good at a few things (some are good at a lot, like Kawhi/LBJ) but there is no other player as well-rounded + ridiculously gifted offensively as MJ."
"Blaming everything on coaching is very shortsighted and ignores the giant flaws with this Bucks team. Tbh the biggest issue is that this Bucks team needs consistent perimeter creation and have to rely a lot on Holiday and Middleton, both guys are simply not good enough and are widely inconsistent. Jrue has proven this playoff run that he's not good enough to be a top end playmaker"
Agree 100%. Bucks coach is running such a clunky looking offense and he doesn't use Jrue Holiday at all. Isn't he a max player? He's like an invisible man out there.
Jrue holiday as well

"On the whole not really, but each team had a guy to slow Steph down (in theory at least) that was missing. Jrue Holiday missed round 1, Conley missed game 1 and played through for the rest of the series, and P Bev was out in the WCF."
"I mean, if you’ve been watching the games, Jrue Holiday is just missing shots he is fully capable of making. Unless the bucks and Bud completely change the system and his role between the playoffs and the regular season, it is hard to explain the large drop off in TS%. Tougher defense in the playoffs I understand, but every player is up against it as well, so that shouldn’t be used as an excuse."
"If Trae doesn't come back or the Hawks lose:  FMVP might be Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Deandre Ayton, Paul George.  Never would have expected those candidates, George is the best player there but we never thought he had a chance at it due to Kawhi being there and now gone."
"Well, you're acting like CP3 being a good defender matters a lot. Jrue Holiday is a better defender than Trae but I don't see anyone arguing he's better than Trae. Having a good defender PG is nice but it simply doesn't impact winning that much.   I actually said 'offensive impact' and I'm not even talking about individual skill when it comes to offence. Trae being on court forces other team to adjust their defence and creates a lot of space for other players. CP3 doesn't have the same impact. He will keep your offence tidy and ticking but nobody's going to overreact if he's got the opposition big on an island. It's hard to explain but Trae's impact is closer to Harden or Luka's and a level above CP3's."
Warriors didn't play any teams missing their best player. Houston was missing Pat Beverley and NOLA was missing Jrue Holiday. They played every All NBA first team member. This season has way more injuries to stars.
"Hate to say it but Jrue is 31, Khris turns 30 in a month. They have no picks after next year. They have one year basically to restock the shelves. Honestly should consider trading those two next year. Denver wouldn’t do it but a Jamal Murray trade might make sense for both teams. Gordon/Murray and other salary for Middleton and Holiday. Bucks tank a year and hope to get two guys back healthy. Nuggets probably become title favorites. I’ll probably get downvoted for that though"
"Would Bucks fans even want to keep Jrue Holiday if Giannis is out next year? He would be 33-years old in the finals if they make it in 2023, and at that age the risk of a decline is getting pretty big."
Khris Middleton  Jrue Holiday  Bud
Jrue holiday is playing horribly. Had like 2 good games the entire playoffs so far.
"Middleton should age decently and can take over playoff games. I think he should be good to compete for the next 4 years or so.  Bucks need to explore using Holiday to upgrade the roster. Not sure what type of trade they can get, maybe something to swindle the Blazers out of CJ McCollum, but Jrue doesn't look like a great playoff player."
Middleton and Jrue Holiday are going to be under the microscope now. Budenholzer should be fired.
Jrue Holiday isn't as good as this sub thinks he has horrible shot selection and decision making
This is by far the worst I ever seen Jrue Holiday in Playoffs  He was dropping 40 for multiple games his last run in New Orleans
Shooting a combined 12/34 (2/7 from three for Holiday and 0/7 for Middleton) with 8 turnovers -- it's abundantly clear that Jrue and Khris left their games in Milwaukee.
"Jrue Holiday got injured in January ffs His team made the playoffs without him that's no excuse at all.   Mike Conley missed game one. They had him when they were up 2-1. Games 4,5,6 he averaged 11 points on less than 40% TS.  Dwight Howard played 35 mpg and played ever game in that series."
Jrue Holiday was hurt for the Pelicans. Conley missed games for the Grizz (and Tony Allen got hurt in game 4 or 5). Rockets were missing Bev and D-Mo (who was their 2nd best player in the regular season) and Dwight tore his MCL in game 1.   There was that narrative that Steph played all backup PGs en route to the title.
"I mean they got to play the Pelicans without Jrue Holiday, the Grizz and Conley/Tony Allen got hurt, the Rockets who had Bev/D-Mo hurt and Dwight tore his MCL in game 1 of the WCF and the Cavs lost Kyrie/Love.   The whole narrative was that Steph didn't play vs anyone's starting PG during the whole run.   With that said this year is significantly worse."
"If there is ever a time for Jrue Holiday to step up, it's this game."
nah thats jrue holiday
Jrue holiday wasn't worth the picks
"Maybe I'm getting old but this aint the Jrue holiday I remember 😭, played way better on the pelicans imho"
Jrue Holiday has been trash all playoffs.
Jrue Holiday cannot exploit a cripple in a wheelchair
"More a function of who he's always been behind, like Paul, Young, Andre Miller, Jrue Holiday, even Kyle Lowry.  3x 6th man of the year for a reason, though."
Trade Jrue Holiday for Ty Lue and the Bucks win the championship this year.
"I swear to god the Bucks are playing against the Hawks, the refs, the crowd, Bud, and Jrue Holiday"
Bucks need so much work on fundamentals of passing. Jrue holiday and Middleton can’t feed the post to save their lives. It’s a turnover most times.
I'm being serious is Jrue Holiday even better than Malcolm Brogdon?
You don't like Jrue Holiday stepbacks and fadeaways.
Bro am I tripping or has Jrue Holiday legit missed the past 40 shots he’s taken????
You can't compare a massive sports town like Boston to Milwaukee dude.   When was the all Star free agent signing besides Jrue Holiday did you guys get that actually made an impact in getting to the play offs?  Or even winning the championship?  I hate it too but what else can we do? I am just stating what happened. If Giannis was all luck then let teams roll the dice until they get one.
The Bucks were able to get a guy like Jrue Holiday for Eric Bledsoe. There are deals to be made if the GM wasn't such a hack.
Jrue Holiday looks completely lost out there.
List of point guards who are 100% better than Reggie Jackson (in no particular order):  1. Curry 2. Lillard 3. Kyrie 4. Cp3 5. Trae Young 6. SGA 7. Jamal Murray 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Jrue Holiday 10. Mike Conley  11. Westbrook 12. Lowry 13. Kemba 14. Brogdon 15. Ja Morant  and that's not even including big guys that technically play PG like  1. LeBron 2. Luka 3. LaMelo 4. Simmons
AD Boogie and Jrue Holiday were indeed a pretty legitimate team. But then injury happens to Boogie and small city team.....
"He's led his team to the playoffs and won series more than AD did. If only AD wasn't playing 1v5 and had guys like Jrue Holiday, Rondo, Boogie. And before you whine about how terribly impacted by injuries those pelicans teams were im reminding you that every single season Tatum has to deal with one of those aforementioned stars breaking their fucking leg"
Top 10 Active Players Remaining:  1) Giannis  2) Paul George  3) Devin Booker  4) Trae Young  5) DeAndre Ayton  6) Khris Middleton  7) Jrue Holiday  8) Chris Paul  9) Reggie Jackson  10) John Collins
"Fr. Curry against the Nets would average like 10 TOVs, he'd make Jrue Holiday look like a defensive demigod"
"Called Crash for that reason. He got injured often doing that. He'd be a good 3rd option although I think guys like McCollum, Jrue Holiday, and Middleton are better than him. Got an All Star due to a weak East talent pool. Closest comparison would be Warriors Iggy, which was elite roleplayer level although he would never win FMVP."
"76ers-Jrue Holiday, Seth Curry, Andre Iguodala, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid,"
Milwaukee. Chris Paul and Jae Crowder are super dirty players and I just can’t bring myself to root for them. Plus I’m a huge fan of Giannis and Jrue Holiday.
"I mean there’s a lot that goes into defence. Rotations, on-ball, off-ball, etc. And he’s just not a smart defender who gets exposed in a lot of ways.  He’s certainly not a “great” defender unless you think there are 100+ “great” defenders.  OG Anunoby is a great defender. Jaylen Brown is great. Jrue Holiday is great. Ayton is great. Wiggins is just good."
"Yeah I remember a shooting foul on Jrue holiday in the Nets series on Durant where he jumped straight up with his hands up, didn’t move them at all, and still got called for a foul."
"I’m… a little bit of a closeted CP3 fan. I’m big into fundamentally sound and unselfish players who can make big plays in important moments, like Jrue Holiday."
Hes better than jrue holiday
"who at #7 though, id say that dude from baylor kind of reminds me of a jrue holiday or kyle lowry type"
"It was a poor decision to iso when you have 40 points on 50%+ shooting ?   He got stripped by Jrue fucking Holiday. He didn't ""choke"""
The way jrue doesn’t even react to holiday pushing to try and make room. What a badass defensive player. Dude is the best defensive player on the bucks.
"It's actually 2 picks and 2 swaps, I think. Which makes it all the more better.  I have a feeling we might have went for it if Kemba didn't have that regenerative knee surgery or something at the start of the season, and we might not even need to give Smart away.  A lineup of Smart-Holiday-Brown-Tatum-Williams III would have been a defensive nightmare for other teams.

"&gt;It’s more that there are millions of people on this su  i honestly don't know if people like /u/ubiasedhoodfriend are being serious and can't comprehend that fact. on that jrue holiday thread, another user is saying something about people criticizing jrue the other day.  even if we only account for the online users at any given time and not the total subbed , more often than not it dwarfs the number of upvotes a post/comment gets  one side becomes more vocal and the other lays low (or lock their sub), it's that simple."
"Or you could acknowledge the fact that Jrue Holiday is an elite, all-world defender in his prime. He is making it hard on CP3."

Refs win it for Jrue holiday steal/foul that would have put Suns up for the win.
"You’d take a back to back mvp over a one time all star to build a team around? What a hot take buddy.   Of course giannis is a better player. Jrue holiday is a top defensive guard in the league though, and is extremely valuable in this particular matchup where the suns best players are in the back court."
and suns fan are griping about the intentional fouls  they commit on giannis all night to keep him going to the free throw line and also claiming jrue holiday committed some atrocious foul when he ripped the ball away.  its actually absurd.   i guess i shouldnt say all suns fan.  but the bandwagon guys who dont understand the game are.  and thats a large chunk of phoenix fans rn
My boy Jrue Holiday from UCLA!!
He was tryna find someone to pass to after being stopped but he end up facing jrue holiday at the right spot
Jrue Bledsoe and Eric Holiday?
Jrue Holiday redemption arc
"Jrue Holiday... I'm just speechless at how amazing this guy is. He can score from everywhere, defends like the best of them, throws lobs, assists, doesn't make many costly turnovers, runs the offense perfectly. He's not as flashy as Trae, Steph, Ja, or Lillard but this guy is a beast."
Sometimes his adjustments are random. Obviously today he got absolutely saved by Jrue Holiday going nuts in the 2nd and 3rd quarter but playing Teague was a game losing move
Ah crap you're right  Brain completely farted and confused Jrue Holiday with Darren Collison
"on the bucks Giannis is the only one deserving to win it,not “several”.Jrue and Holiday were terrible in first 2 games"
This is a pretty typical Jrue Holiday steal. Booker tries to body him to make that space to dribble around him but he just doesn't budge. He's still there swiping at the ball. Too strong.
The Jrue Holiday in that series was amazing but that was the only playoff series AD ever won at the time. We’ll get to see if AD makes the jump to the next level in the coming years. But btw there’s no shame in being the 7th-10th best player in the league and that’s coming from another lakers fan
&gt; I don’t think AD can do that like the others  AD swept Dame with Jrue Holiday as his best player (and he wasnt the Jrue we saw tonight) I don't think hes better than Giannis or Harden but to act like he can't lead a team to victory is a casual take
"I’ve heard someone call Gary Payton’s son Mitten haha. Seriously though, I think Jrue Holiday might be the best pg defender I’ve ever seen since The Glove."
"You can't be a bad coach if you're coaching a team who came back from 0-2, mind you that it should've been 1-1 but Khris and Jrue Holiday played like ass"
"That‘s what I'm thinking too. Not to mention, age is always a factor with prospects and he is already 22/23. Unfortunately I don't get to watch college bball, so I can't really evaluate him. But based on what I've seen from highlights and analysis, I think there's better options for us, like packaging the picks for an all-star caliber player. Even if you try to justify taking Mitchell with the 7th pick because ""he's a win now type of player"", there's no guarantee for that. And with us having Curry, he would come off the bench anyways. Definitely reminds me of Jrue Holiday though, atleast defensively."
"Look, shitcunt.  Jrue Holiday is one of the best, if not the best, lockdown defender in the league. He also dropped a bunch of points on the Nets heads today.  Similarly, in this Finals series, Khris Middleton has done more than Harden ever did - and with a whole lot less cheating as well.  So you can take your whining about the quality of the players in this series and shove it.  Oh, and on the other side - it's a coming out party for Booker. He's played amazingly.  And if you can't see that, then you're a LA Lakers fan, which is to say you're a self-obsessed fuck with with zero respect for the game or it's history."
Jrue Holiday just ripped the Larry O’Brien trophy out of Bookers hands with that steal.
"Jrue Holiday was taking his usual shot + some Hella tuff one but this time, he hit those."
"right? you think history is going to be kind to jrue fucking holiday taking over this game? no shit if multiple top 100 players and a couple top 20 all time were playing in the same finals, and it was going this way, people would be all over it. You cant compare khris middleton to james harden or devin booker to even kyrie"
Jrue holiday proving himself frfr
"I mean, yeah. They didn’t trade for a championship though, they traded for Holiday. Realistically, 3 picks and 2 swaps for a guy who could move the needle on a championship roster makes sense as a price because of their relative value. They didn’t trade for a championship, just for better odds; the question then becomes how much Jrue improves those odds to determine his relative value. Honestly, I don’t think they paid a ridiculous price for him given context, but I also can’t imagine any other situation Holiday brings in a haul like that. Definitely an interesting situation value-wise though, no doubt."
"Well allow me to be wrong. And in the spirit of being wrong I’ve decided to be thoroughly and intricately wrong. Let’s begin.   We start with Kareem and Giannis. We all know Kareem is the career scoring champion but not for long. Lebron will soon dethrone him. And who dethroned Lebron? Why, Giannis of course. By this logic alone Giannis is better but if we get down to the details statistically Giannis is a better player. He provides similar defense and scoring with the added passing and fast break scoring dimension to his game. Also Giannis doesn’t play against plumbers (except Joe Ingles).   Next we have Worthy and Middleton. Middleton won’t have a better career than Worthy I’ll give you that. But right now he’s at his peak and his peak sent a full strength KD and choke job Harden home sans Giannis. One could say KD is a poor mans Khris Middleton. One could say any shot KD can hit Middleton *will* hit. And one will say (that one being me) he’s the best player in the playoffs. No exceptions. Khris ‘bug-eye/deadeye’ Middleton is better than Giannis and thus is better than Kareem who was better than Worthy.   Any questions? I didn’t think so.   Finally we have my most controversial (wrong) take. Magic bricked so many jump shots you’d think the guy had AIDS. He’s an all time great point god sure. But you know who else is an all time great point god? CP3.  Now I love CP3 but I hope State Farm has an ass insurance policy because Holiday has proceeded to rip CP3s ass off just so he can hand it to him. But that doesn’t mean Jrue is better than Magic it means he’s better than CP3. And in all honesty he’s not. But the edge I give to Magic is erased by Magic’s tenure as a GM. You can’t be that bad at building a basketball team and continue to call yourself a basketball player.  In conclusion (aka **tl;dr**) Kareem can’t pass like Giannis, Middleton is the 2nd best iso scorer in NBA history and Magic Johnson GMd his way out of even qualifying as a basketball player."
"People have been saying for years Giannis and Middleton could be the foundation for a championship team. They just couldn't get over the hump. Jrue is the piece that might get them over the hump.   Giannis, Middleton and Holiday are a serious unstoppable threat when all three guys are on. This stat just backs that up."
Again. Suns lost this game — and not because of this play. But lots of casual fans getting married to the narrative here.  [You can use your own two eyeballs (unless ya got one) to see that Jrue Holiday grabs Booker’s wrists and tugs him downwards here.](https://streamable.com/g2wfqf).  Know how I’m wrong? Man I’m not asking for your opinion.  Lol how is that wrong? 🤣 It’s 2021 man — we got replay.
"He was the primary defender on Jrue Holiday &amp; rotated late on 2 wide open 3s. Dude might’ve scored 40 but he gave up a shit load too. Plus with how much he had the ball in his hands, he only had 3 assists ? &amp; you can’t even use the excuse that “Suns didn’t hit shots” when they all shot a better % than he did. It’s hard to understand but there’s more to basketball than scoring. But good for him 40 points is cool 👍🏼"
Jrue Holiday has been terrorizing me ever since I accidentally set him to 99 overall in 2k11 before starting my player and he won mvp and dpoy in 5 straight seasons
"Imagine telling someone in 2013 that Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and Giannis Antetokounmpo would be a Big 3"
"Jrue ""Back From"" Holiday!"
"Jrue ""back from"" Holiday at it again"
Brandon Jennings possessing Jrue Holiday to make sure Bucks In Six happens
"Jrue ""Puts Them Over The Edge"" Holiday"
Take my upvote you bastard. Good W. Jrue Holiday had the game of a lifetime. I’ve always been a fan.
Jrue sending The Sons on Holiday
Jrue decided it's time to send the Suns on holiday (even though there's another game left lol)
"Today, Holiday went from Drew to Jrue."
KD airballed a 3 due to fatigue not no fucking Jrue holiday my guy come on now. Khris has had bigger QUARTERS than Jrue’s entire game output some nights.
"Grow taller, box out. It's one thing for Giannis to outrebound your team, it's another when it's Jrue Holiday"
"Same. I also have a sweet spot for Middleton cuz now it’s satisfying to see him playing like the opponents are the Celtics, and you can’t possibly hate jrue holiday. Honestly the entire bucks squad is p likeable imo."
i still remember playing pickup in 2008 or 2009. [jrue holiday had played a local high school team in the CIF playoffs. he had like 29 and 15 and 6.](https://www.maxpreps.com/games/2-22-2008/basketball-winter-07-08/campbell-hall-vs-st-joseph.htm?c=QfTT9F1C70Wp9_n9pXaeMw#tab=box-score&amp;schoolid=)  one of the kids that played against him was playing pickup with us talking about he wasn't even that good. lmfao.  always remember that shit when jrue balls out.
"Because its a lot harder to move the ball around when the other team has Giannis and Jrue Holiday.  Same thing with Utah vs. LAC, when there’s two DPOY candidates on the other team making long passes become much less possible. Or at the very least the fear of doing so plays a large factor."
Can't make it any less cliche but the but Bucks just executed way better at the end.  They got stops and they made the big buckets.  Jrue Holiday redeemed himself bigtime this game especially on the defensive end.
"Jrue ""Dwight Howard"" Holiday"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo continues to be one of the greatest European players ever! Also, Jrue Holiday played well"
The no timeout call this game wasn't bad. Phoenix had so much momentum and the Bucks were crumbling...until Jrue Holiday flipped the switch
"Jrue Holiday was close to perfection out there tonight! Finally found his groove on offense making, distributed the ball at a high level, &amp; we you need him most to get a crucial stop he delivered. Game ball goes out to Jrue with an exceptional performance tonight!"
Jrue holiday has those Sam cassell balls
"You fuckers better take back your Jrue Holiday slander. The man regularly takes on the hardest defensive assignment on the team and is always active on both ends. Even when his shots aren't falling, he's an asset to the team. When his shots *are* falling, he is the best player on the floor."
HOLY FUCK MAKE JULY 17TH A JRUE HOLIDAY!!
Imagine if the Suns got a defensive monster on their team.   What about that Jrue Holiday guy? He’d probably be a good get.
JRUE HOLIDAY FUCK
Why is jrue holiday never in the conversation for DPOY? This guys different on defense. He's locked up cp3 all series and makes massive plays. 3 steals and a block in a must win finals game.
*jrue holiday foul and giannis dunk in game 5
Jrue Holiday playing like he’s Luca’s Italian Seamother throwing children into a fountain.
"Jrue ""I'm the reason for Bucks in Six, where's my respect"" Holiday"
"When Jrue is defending Paul, Paul doesn't look like he belongs in the NBA. When Jrue goes on Booker, Paul is looking like a borderline all-star.  His offense has been hit or miss, but Holiday has been a monster this series on the defensive side."
How about Jrue Holiday putting the clamps on DBook to win the game? Such a tough defender.
JRUE FUCK MOTHERING HOLIDAY
What a straight up incredible game.  Jrue holiday with the game deciding steal and fastbreak.  This is why we watch basketball nephews.
JRUE HOLIDAY IS A BEAST
THE JRUE HOLIDAY GAME
"Games 1-3 may have been kinda mid but those last two? Worth every second. Jrue fucking Holiday, man  anyway bucks in 6 i guess"
Jrue fucking holiday man. 1 more to go the bucks 😎
"Jrue holiday carried giannis. Doesn’t count, sadly"
"Had he contributed earlier, maybe they wouldn't be in this scenario? Oh yeah, Jrue Holiday made him look like a 2nd string bench player the 1st three quarters."
Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are the most clutch players of all time
Jrue holiday said not today
These Bucks are too much fun to watch. Jrue Holiday playing like defense is going out of style.
ITS THE JRUE HOLIDAY GAME EVERYBODY
Jrue” Michael Jordan” Holiday Showed up tonight.
Jrue Holiday is literally better than Micheal Jordan
LEGENDARY Jrue Holiday game absolutely LEGENDARY
So is Jrue Holiday the greatest player in the NBA..
Jrue Holiday is who Paul George thinks he is.
Jrue Holiday slander has now been cancelled.
"I’ve been wanting CP3 to finally win a title, but Jrue Holiday and Giannis are really winning me over. It’s hard not to root for them"
I just want to say that Jrue '' I'm going to send the Suns '' on Holiday is the best two-way guard of all time.
Jrue Holiday was well worth trading all those picks and players. He and Khris both have been clutch in late-game situations.
JRUE HOLIDAY!! BUCKS IN SIX!!
Hot Take: Jrue Holiday is good at basketball
"JRUE ""I AIN'T ERIC BLEDSOE"" HOLIDAY"
Got to feel good for Jrue Holiday. Man got his name dragged through the mud all series and comes out clean on the other side with a career game.  Good for him.
JRUE FUCKING HOLIDAY!!!!
EVERYONE SAY THANK YOU JRUE HOLIDAY
Jrue Holiday deserves every penny hes being paid.
Love how Giannis calls Jrue Holiday just “Holiday”
Jrue Holiday is the missing piece all along
JRUE HOLIDAY
Jrue holiday is a basketball player.
JRUE FUCKING HOLIDAY
Pretty sure Jrue Holiday made up for the entire rest of the postseason tonight
Jrue Holiday got DBook so shook.

"But imagine being this mad that fans post highlights of there favorite player.  Hi, if you think Jrue Holiday or the Kings deserve more highlights maybe you should post them instead of sitting here whining."
Jrue holiday is very aesthetically pleasing offensively
"&gt;Jrue Holiday went 33 pts (14/23), 7 reb and 11 ast; a higher GmSc. I've seen exactly zero posts about him tonight. While KAT gets like 5 posts. Silliness.   Because KAT was playing the top team in the East and Jrue was playing the Kings...."
"&gt; Those teams also have accomplished nothing.   Exactly my point.   &gt; And Ja certainly had plenty of highlights during his rookie campaign.   Is KAT a rookie?  Also:  Jrue Holiday went 33 pts (14/23), 7 reb and 11 ast; a higher GmSc. I've seen exactly zero posts about him tonight. While KAT gets like 5 posts. Silliness.   KAT's never been a winner. Well, maybe in HS? I don't know."
6 offensive rebounds on PG Jrue Holiday is not a number I expected to see when I woke up.
"Sixers didn’t really have anything to blow up, other than Jrue Holiday. But we had little talent after that and had multiple future picks traded away. He traded away *overvalued* players like MCW but he also held onto Embiid, Noel, Covington, Saric, Grant, Holmes, and McConnell who are all solid players right now.   OKC was a legit playoff team, almost won a playoff series, and ended up gutting half their roster just to tank. I don’t see how that’s any better."
Both teams traded those players to tank.  Hinkie blew up a Jrue Holiday-Evan Turner core.  And somehow that’s worse?
"I agree. It’s fair value for a player like Jrue Holiday but had a lot of risk involved (well more risk than usual when giving up several firsts) seeing as Giannis' extension was looming and Jrue is set to be a FA this offseason I believe if he declines.  Giannis has extended and Jrue will likely stay, it’s not really an overpay."
Jrue Holiday
"Giannis out, Middleton cold, Jrue Holiday steps up and plays the main man to steer the ship home. What an unreal performance."
 Jrue Holiday is a monster...look out for him come playoff time.
My nba comparison for Suggs is Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday
"&gt;He's really like the perfect PG to pair with Luka.  He's definitely not the ideal PG to pair with Luka. A Jrue Holiday type guy would be more ideal. A large, defensive minded PG/SG who can also serve as a good secondary playmaker and ball handler who can create their own shot when needed.   FVV is another good example. That's what we want Brunson to be but defensively he isn't there yet. But maybe he can really make a leap on that end of the court in the next year or so."
&gt;No you're right. Home court advantage with a packed stadium doesn't matter. That's why every playoffs I'd played six months after the season on a neutral court with fans watching from their home on giant tv screens  and players are quarantined from their families for weeks on end.  What would you say the difference would be in this scenario? Is the crowd going to bully Giannis into being effective outside of 3 feet?  &gt;O and of course Bledsoe and Jrue are the exact same player and one absolutely doesn't make up for almost every single flaw the other had.  They’re not the same player but neither player solves the Buck’s main concern. Jrue is a serviceable shooter but nobody leaving Giannis in the paint to close out on Jrue Holiday. They’ll still have the same concerns offensively.   &gt;Just incredible basketball analysis. You're such a smart boy.  Thanks! You aren’t. You should really learn how to accept criticism of your team without being defensive. Discussing basketball becomes a lot more fun with that one simple trick.
"It could happen, he’d just need to play with guys the level of Draymond or Jrue Holiday"
I disagree and I also disagree with the “overall checklist “ type of argument. Jrue Holiday probably has more of an overall game than Steph Curry but Curry will always be more valuable.
"Statistically Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, Rondo/Boogie, then you get into the new line-up.  IDK if Chris Paul/David West count"
"Whats the obvious alternative? There isnt one. Klay and Draymonds contracts are massive anchors. Wiseman isnt going to be moved for any value even close to his draft pick status, ie., you’re not getting Brad Beal, Jrue Holiday type guys for Wiseman+Oubre or something. Like, I get Wiseman hasn’t been good but its not like trading him fixes what ails the warriors. On top of that, isnt he very available? They definitely tried to move the #2 pick before the draft but couldn’t."

Jrue Holiday in Lakers
"Look at literally any actual basketball analysis and the 2015 warriors are one of the best teams of all time.  Keep your narratives but if youre gonna tell me Jrue Holiday, pat Bev, Mike Connelly, and Kyrie Irving would have stopped this team at any point... well, believe what you want dude"
I’d like to nominate Jrue Holiday and Robert Covington
"Not to be pedantic, but he is the best, not one of them.  The only other player that’s close is Klay, and he’s not playing right now.  Honorable mentions to JJ Redick, Kyle Korver and Jrue Holiday."
Jrue Holiday in 2019. Jimmy Butler in 2018. Both defenses were statistically pretty dang bad and they made it.
Just waiting for the mods to give me back my Jrue holiday flair and lying low with the Kings flair.
"Oh lol I didn’t even realize it switched back.  Dancing Queen is the best ABBA song ever, so I switched to it, but forgot it reverts to the Kigns afterwards. I’ll keep it on until I can get the mods to make my flair Jrue Holiday again"
"Milwaukee could have offered Jrue holiday and more, Blazers are stupid into thinking CJ and Dame can win a chip. They coulda gotten a deal done."
"Manners bro. More than half the teams he mentioned had no avenue to make that trade happen. think Milwaukee or portland. Players and their agents know what is possible well enough. Milwaukee just traded all assets they had for jrue holiday. Portland showed time and time again, that they won't break up their backcourt, as McCollum and dame are close friends.I argue some of the preferred teams they mention are just tokens and the players know they can't end up there. AD did the same, he added the bucks to his list of teams after all."
"Coaches and other players also think Kobe has a case over Lebron. Which is absolute nonsense.   Almost no one is combing through old take with painstaking detail and judging the full scope of subtle defensive mistakes or impact. Players will swear by Jrue Holiday being the a top 3 defender in the league when that’s clearly not the case.   DPOY voting is clearly nonsense and narrative based, for gods sake Andre Drummond received votes for DPOY.   Ben Taylor is the only guy publicly out there who has made use of the best available advanced metrics that go beyond DWS or individual DRTG, as well as looked at that much footage.   You can disagree with his opinion but he’s put forward the most well formed assessment out there specifically on this."
*jrue holiday
I like your *username lol  *Edited. Jrue Holiday/Iggy era Sixers were pretty cool
"He specifically stated he wanted to play with Jrue Holiday, and that was the reason for NOLA. Then, they traded Jrue. So he wanted to leave."
Jrue Holiday
The fact that you said you guys built around lebron better than Houston built around Harden automatically discredits your whole argument. Especially considering that warriors team Harden and cp3 almost beat swept lebron 2 years in a row even when he had kyrie for one of those years. Lebrons teams in his first stint wouldnt win one game against them while the rockets were a cp3 injury away from making it to the Finals. Also Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are better than anyone those Cavs teams had other than Lebron the disrespect is insane to call them a “role player”.
"Jrue is posting career highs in pretty much every efficiency metric, counting stats may slip when you play with Giannis but advanced stats go through the roof.  Lopez, Portis, and now Holiday have all gotten a serious bump sharing the floor with him. Brogdon’s numbers cratered when he left."
"Yea, and with the play of Jrue Holiday of late I think voters will attribute less credit to Giannis and more to Holiday since he's the thing that changed on the Bucks.   If Embiid is really coming back this weekend, then he's the most obvious threat to Jokic's chances. The 76ers stayed a float while he was out but were just bad enough to make the case that Embiid is really valuable to to the team. Like, I think you would have seen some voters trying to discredit Embiid's chances if the 76ers had gone like 11-1 without him or something"

"I like Jrue Holiday a lot. Honestly might be my favorite player in the NBA, outside of AD and Bron as a Lakers fan."
Didn’t know Jrue holiday bullying Schroeder was on the menu tonight
Jrue Holiday is such a massive upgrade over bledsoe it isn't even funny
I say it every game but the upgrade from Bledsoe and Hill to Jrue Holiday is insane
"I mean compared to where we before? With a 22 year old Jrue Holiday as our best player, no other young talent, down a ton of picks? Yeah I’ll take it."
Remember when this sub said Jrue Holiday wasn't that much of an upgrade over Bledsoe.
Jrue Holiday is the clapper of worlds
If Jrue Holiday really doesn’t want to stay in Milwaukee a Jrue/Kemba sign and trade could work for both sides
they were a lot better when he signed; they had Jrue Holiday
Eyy he said Jrue Holiday instead of Justin Holiday everyone has to drink
"I am not buying what he is selling here.  He signed to the Pelicans on July 15th, 2019.   Zion was drafted by the Pelicans on June 20th of that same year.  If you couldn't see the writing on the wall regarding the possibility that Jrue Holiday could be traded in the next couple of seasons, I don't know what to tell you other than you ARE naive, which, surprise surprise, he tries to paint himself as such as the story goes on. Way too convenient.   JJ is not, in fact, this naive. He took the biggest contract that he could, and then Covid happened. Like a good family man (which I think that he is), he asked if he could be bought out or traded to a place that was closer to Brooklyn. Nothing wrong with that at all!  The front office said we'll try, couldn't make it happen, and took the best deal possible. Nothing wrong with that either!  &amp;#x200B;  JJ is spinning this as though he came to the Pelicans to play with Jrue Holiday and chase a title and then ""aw shucks, the FO pulled the rug out from under me on that one and then covid happened and they did it again with my trade request...Poor naive me, they are a bad front office!""  If he is this naive, I will stand corrected."
"But that is my whole point.  Do you think the other hundreds of other basketball players in the NBA don't also have situations change for them on a team that they would, in retrospect, have gone to another team?  Like this is the job.  And JJ is not a big enough star to be asking for all these concessions for a team to trade him where he wants or buy him out.  Like I'm sorry I just don't see how New Orleans has any obligation to cater to him like that.  They did try to accommodate him and it didn't work out.  Oh well, that's the job.  JJ isn't AD or Lebron or even Jrue Holiday for fuck sake.  The whole thing is just way overblown."
"Obviously money plays a role but, part of the reason he originally wanted to play in New Orleans was Jrue Holiday"
"Underrated: Jrue Holiday, the dude gets some props but he’s honestly a beast"
I did not say jrue holiday
You clearly haven’t seen Jrue Holiday in the playoffs. The bucks are a real contender
"PG -- Chris Paul   SG -- Jrue Holiday      SF --  Brandon Ingram   PF --  Zion   C -- Anthony Davis    BONUS: 6th Man: David West     Literally everybody else would have some sort of Asterisk of ""Well, but...."" I'm pretty sure Shoeless Joe Jackson might qualify as our 7th man."
I feel like “young girl” is the wrong way to describe Lauren Holiday. She was literally playing college soccer at the same time that Jrue was playing for their college bball team.  I’m not saying you’re making him sound like a creep going for “young girls” but I’m just clarifying for ppl who may understand. He’s not Karl Malone.
"Chris Paul, Jrue Holiday, Glen Rice, Anthony Davis, and Alonzo Mourning starting with Larry Johnson, Zion, Brandon Ingram, Baron Davis, and Dell Curry (I guess I don't remember too many more Pelicans guards tbh) as the second unit. The Pelicans all time team would be fun."
"He was an all-star when Sixers traded for him, you included Iggy so why not Tobias?      Is big market Milwaukee trading for Jrue Holiday somehow more okay than Golden State trading for Iggy?      You're acting as if Denver wouldn't pull the trigger on big time trade if they had the assets. Market isn't as important as you make it look like, it's about whether the team can contend or not."
Have they tried throwing Jrue Holiday at him?
"That Pelicans team was also missing Cousins who was on an MVP like rn for 40 games before he got injured. People said that the team ran at a better pace with him benched but they could've really used him in that Warriors series to take advantage of their lack of size.   Like Rondo,Holiday,Mirotic,AD, and Cousins? With hill and Moore coming off the bench? That was a championship level team and they showed it by dismantling the blazers(Jrue Holiday balled tf out.) and taking a game off the warriors without their arguable best player."
"Didn't the Bucks try trading everyone not named Giannis to get a second star in Jrue Holiday? On paper Jrue Khris and Giannis seems like a really solid core on both ends, is it just not materializing the way you guys had planned?"
"Jrue Holiday was approached by a young UCLA fan asking for his autograph. The little girl thought he was Collison, so he explained who he was. Holiday’s future wife saw the interaction and said he was cuter than Collison. So, Collison indirectly brought the 2 together"
He’d be like a poor mans Russell Westbrook mixed with better version of jrue holiday. Top 5 pg.
"The Jrue Krewe half-season was the most fun I had watching the Pelicans in over a decade. The sweep against Portland the previous year was great, but it was just so much fun watching those guys competing. All the assets from Davis and Holiday are nice, but there's a part of me that will always wonder what would have happened had we run the Jrue Krewe with Zion."
"I mean Collison wasn't a slouch, but between this and Jrue Holiday meeting his wife, I'm starting to wonder what the hell was going on with Collison at UCLA."
"18 first rounders is a ton, and I think you have to take into account just how random drafting can be. One thing I did that I found quite interesting is just pick any 7 year stretch and use a random number generator to randomly pick a list of 18 first rounders. Almost every time, you end up with a great, multiple time all-star, player.   I did it once from the 2005-2011 draft and got a team with DeMarre Carroll, Joakim Noah, Jrue Holiday and Steph Curryand then did it again with 2012-2018 draft and got Jaylen Brown, Micheal Porter Jr, Jonathan Isaac, Jamal Murray, Clint Capela, and Dennis Schroder.   18 first rounders doesn’t mean that you automatically win a championship, but it definitely means you get a top 10-15 player. You have to get really unlucky to not stumble into at least one elite player."
"He has to get lucky in the draft at least once. Most likely it will be with one of the rockets/clippers picks.   Unfortunately No superstar is clamoring to be traded to OKC now or in the future, so any trade will prob look like an overpay. Eg multiple firsts for a borderline all star similar to the Jrue Holiday trade to bucks."
"Exactly. Like the Pelicans series where they got swept, the dude had Jrue Holiday as his primary defender, and they basically double or triple teamed him on most possessions. It's no wonder the dude struggles when he has 2 guys on him nearly every time down the floor"
"Luka yes, AD no chance. AD is arguably the best defender in the league and also can literally do everything on offense, whether it's shoot, create for himself, take it to the rim, play post or screen. Dame is a talented offensive player who has historically struggled against double teams or super long perimeter defenders (like jrue holiday), while being probably one of the worst defenders in the league"
1. JRUE HOLIDAY  ————  2. Steph   3. CP3  4. Westbrook  5. Dame  Honorable mention: Kyle Lowry
"Mike Conley, CP3, Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic. I'd rather have these guys than pay Dennis 20M+/year"
People usually think the most underrated player in the nba is someone who is a star that doesn’t get enough shine. Like Jrue holiday. The truth is the most underrated player in the nba is someone like Melton. A very good player that no one outside of Memphis has ever heard of.
"This conversation has been had 1000 times. Anyone still ""arguing"" is doing so in bad faith trying to gaslight how bad the trade was for the Rockets.   There is no way to spin trading 2 years of Harden for Levert, 2 bad picks, 2 ambiguous picks, and at best 2 pick swaps in a market where Jrue Holiday fetches 3 FRP"
"Jrue ""cheeks"" Holiday"
LeBron lowkey ass. Steph should go to the Bucks and team up with a real player like Jrue Holiday
"Positionless basketball though.  Finding talent on the wings is definitely the hardest but I can't specify a single position.  Consider the top ten point guards and compare them to the top ten SGs or SFs and you'll start matching up dudes like Joe Ingles and Kelly Oubre with Jrue Holiday and Trae Young.  Then look at the big men who got bought out.  The wing is the hardest place to find talent for sure, what position you call it is up to you."
Did you see what Jrue Holiday went for?
"It probably has to do with the growing narrative around how to build teams (FA or trade or draft) and what options are really there. The only marquee free agent I can remember Houston signing is Dwight, and looking at some surface level research, that's accurate for the last 30 years. For whatever reason (and multiple owners were involved) no one wants to sign in Houston. So they pretty much have to build through trades (tried that got close) or through the draft. They seem to be going for the draft route now (although with the new draft rules this is a worse path). Simmons won't get them a championship and they have no resources to build a competent team around him, so there is really no reason to trade for him (they were good for 8 years, nothing Simmons does would elevate them above that and more likely they would be sitting in the 8-10 spot in the west).   Now, could they have gotten more for the trade, possibly. It would appear that Simmons would have garnered slightly more return than Brooklyn's poopoo platter, especially if they waited until the offseason to complete the return leg of the trade (granted risk of Simmons getting hurt) judging on the Jrue Holiday trade. The league would be much more balanced though and this buyout bullshit wouldn't be quite so loud."
"Not a transcript but the big points of this major story are:  1.	⁠AD is playing COD, but it’s his last game (liar!!!!), asks if LeBron is jumping on 2.	⁠LeBron will not be jumping on and is at Dud’s (Dudley?) house and treating his foot, just called to check in 3.	⁠LeBron comments about Jrue Holiday going off"

I have it on good authority that Jrue Holiday is worth at least three late firsts and two pick swaps.
you try beating the god warriors with jrue holiday and a bunch of crackwhores
what jrue holiday clip you think he reacted to?
What did he say about Jrue Holiday?
2nd best pg in the league behind Jrue Holiday
"Are they really better? Jrue Holiday is a more valuable player than McCollum, especially prior to this year.  I’d say Dame being embarrassed had a lot more to do with Jrue and the Pels scheme.  Either way Dame has been on a mother level the past season and a half from then.  I’m not a huge Dame fan either, I agree his defense is an issue, but when you’re the better offensive player an argument can definitely be made even with AD’s defense."
"We're 8th for defensive rating, from mid-twenties near the start of the season. We've been regularly switching between zone and man defense and getting practice against good teams with both. A number of bench players have improved hugely on individual defense, and we have Jrue Holiday and PJ Tucker.  This level of self-pity is weird. We lost a game against a good team having a great shooting night."
"well yeah, it's hard to do well when your superstar (jrue holiday, terance mann) is sitting"
Find someone that makes you feel safe the way Jrue Holiday makes the Bucks feel safe.
"I know this comment isn't directly about this post, but why didn't anyone tell us Jrue Holiday was so good?"
That’s on the Rockets though.   They opted to take a package that’s slightly better than what the Bucks gave for Jrue Holiday.   The League couldn’t possibly veto the trade. And the Nets had to give up a lot of their roster.... just none of them went to the Rockets.
"He doesn’t need to guard him 1 on 1 to have made his life hell, again, if you couldn’t understand.  His defensive numbers were insane in all those rounds. Even Jrue holiday Didnt guard him 1 on 1 in that infamous series, it was ADs hedge defense that made it possible anyways"
"&gt; Lol guards can't even guard Dame or Kyrie, FOH.  I seem to recall CP3 eating Dame's lunch in their matchup in 2016, in fact when CP3 got hurt was when Dame actually played well in the series. Jrue Holiday also guarded Dame exceptionally well in their 2018 matchup, so yeah, hardly ""unguardable"".  &gt; Do I think Draymond is the best defender of all time? It's literally an impossible, and pointless, question to answer.  No it isn't, as his claim isn't backed up by awards (there are countless all-time great defenders who are more decorated than he is), by stats (Draymond shockingly has never led this league in DWS and only led it in DBPM twice) or by the eye test. Dwight Howard won three straight DPOYs, led the league in blocks twice, led it in DWS four times in a row and in DBPM once. Also, the eye test CLEARLY showed that Howard was WAY more impactful than Green was on defense.  &gt; team defense, switch ability, recognition/awareness, communication, etc etc all matter.  Yes, let's act like Draymond Green is the only all-time great defender that has those skills, as if Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwight, Pippen and many others didn't have all those skills AND were more athletically gifted with better individual defensive prowess.  &gt; Yeah Draymond is gonna get burnt by some guards  Tell me one instance where Draymond Green has successfully guarded an elite NBA guard for an extended period of time. You won't find it, because Klay takes all the defensive assignments on guards and when Draymond gets switched on to them, he is neither fast or athletic enough to stay in front of them. Draymond couldn't guard Kyrie, Dame, Mitchell, Murray, you name it, he simply doesn't have the athletic abilities to guard a quick small guard.  &gt; Once again, not saying he's the best defender of all time.  You don't have to, he isn't even close. Ben Wallace was CLEARLY better (backed up by stats AND individual awards) than Draymond Green and anchored an actual all-time great defense on a team that didn't have the greatest offense in NBA history, so they actually had to hold opponents to less than 80 points to win."
"**2020-2021 Trades**  Jrue Holiday - 3 FRP  James Harden - 4 FRP, Caris LeVert  I’m skeptical."
Jrue Holiday
"You don’t know what I mean by saying he’s not Jrue Holiday on defense but he’s not Trae Young either? It’s a pretty common way to compare things, you use one great example and one bad example to show where your comparison fits.  Like, this player isn’t as good at D as Jrue is, but he’s better than Trae Young at defense.  It’s no different from saying “I’m not rich (Birdzier’s defense), I don’t have as much money as Elon Musk (Jrue’s defense), but I’m not poor because I have money than that homeless man (Trae Young Defense)”  It’s really not that hard to understand, I don’t get what tripped you up there."
Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday
"Yeah no shit. In the end, it's nothing serious, and people just wanna trash talk and say stupid funny shit on Twitter, like bubble frauds and bubble guppies. Anyone with an eye and a brain know that the Bucks got significantly better with Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker, and Bud actually making some adjustments."
"People keep acting like these are the same two teams from last year, which is not the case. Most notably, Jrue holiday has been extremely valuable to the bucks, an incredible addition"
"Bucks played great defense, it was so fun to watch. Jrue Holiday and PJ Tucker we’re huge additions for them.   On top of the great defense Butler missed shots he normally hits, that happens in basketball. It’s really not that crazy to see great players or teams go on cold streaks. The Heat just happened to play bad at the worst possible time, it happens."
Just close down useless posts like this. How do you even think Jrue holiday is a top 5 point guard. There are 5 better PGs in the west....
"Bryn Forbes &gt;&gt; Kyle Korver (way past his prime)  Bobby Portis &gt;&gt; Robin Lopez (another rim protector that can shoot the 3)  Jrue Holiday &gt;&gt; Eric Bledsoe (need I say more?)  PJ Tucker &gt; Eran Illyasova (more defense, and more corner threes)  This bucks team is KILLING it with their depth."
"Both can be true. The bucks look great this year. Getting jrue holiday really changed things. HOWEVER, the heat also had massive expectations this year considering they made the finals. They beat top tier teams during the regular season as well. They choked this year, plain and simple. They didn’t win a SINGLE game. You can say the bucks deserve praise but the heat deserve ridicule just the same lol"
"This is so stupid, I hate posts that try to say one thing is 100% wrong because some other thing is 100% correct. There’s never any nuance on here. As always, both things are true.  Going from Bledsoe to Jrue Holiday is a ridiculous upgrade, the Bucks are clearly much better and more dangerous than they were last year. Bucks-Nets could end up being the best series of the whole postseason.  But just the same, Jimmy Butler was awful this year in the playoffs. Tyler Herro went from an up and coming star (which was stupid at the time) to just “a guy”. Bam also went from a dominant force to a guy who was afraid to shoot a 10 foot jumper."
I'm just here to read the Jrue Holiday praise
"While you’re right, this is as empty of a statement as saying Miami are frauds.  Present your evidence!  It’s bountiful.  We learned what the game looks like when Giannis guards Jimmy - Jimmy struggles.  Tyler Herro is not playing anywhere near the level he did in the bubble and I don’t think anyone is sure why, but it’s a huge factor.  Jrue Holiday is a huge acquisition and I didn’t check this for sure, but I’ll bet he led the Bucks in +/- this series.  He’s a huge upgrade over Eric Bledsoe who honestly really struggled with anxiety and pressure in playoff games.  You say “getting punched in the mouth made them hungrier and angrier” but I mean, that’s just something you say in hindsight that doesn’t really mean anything.  They prepared more for playoff basketball this year and learned a defense that switches everything.  They’re playing different basketball from last year."
It's that damn Jrue Holiday! He's so hot right now!
"And I would much much rather have Dame. I cannot overstate how much better Lillard is on offense. Lillard is far better than Holiday at everything on offense but finishing at the rim. Lillard makes his teammates much better and spaces the floor 10 feet behind the 3 point line at least. Lillard is adding at least 15-16 more points on offense each game than Jrue is, and Jrue definitely isn't making that up on defense.  I don't know why I even have to argue this at all. We're comparing a 1 time all-star who hasn't made the team in 8 years vs a guy who is likely going to be 1st or 2nd team all-nba for the 4th year in the row and is consistently a top 10 MVP candidate. Jrue is borderline top 30 while Lillard is borderline top 10. They aren't near the same tier..."
It is weird that no one wants to mention upgrading from Eric Bledsoe/George Hill to JRUE HOLIDAY as a reason to think these Bucks might be more successful
"I was gonna make a thread on this. Milwaukee has the best chance to beat the Nets out of any team. Including the Lakers, Philly, anyone …  1- Nets biggest weakness is size. I trust Giannis the most to completely dominate and use his size. Far more then I trust Anthony Davis to. I trust Embiid , but…  2- Bucks have the combo of scorers/star power  and defenders. Philly has the defenders, but with Simmons being a non factor offensively there is no way Philly matches BK’s scoring with a big 3 of embiid, Harris, and …..Seth Curry? Not enough.  3- Jrue holiday. In this day n age it’s practically impossible to “shut down “ a high level offensive  player. One of the few cases of it being done is Jrue vs Dame a few years ago. And then he swarmed Kyrie earlier this year. I’m a believer in him at least neutralizing Kyrie/harden. From there it levels the playing field somewhat and Giannis can cause enough headaches for BK that the bucks shooters go apeshit  So imo the bucks will either win this series or it will be the Nets hardest series remaining. My heart wants to say the lakers can beat BK, but I have no faith whatsover in AD’s frail, fall on every other play, soft, jumpshooting, ‘I don’t wanna play the 5’ shenanigans. Lebron will be Lebron but at age 36 he’ll just equal KD’s output at best. Cant expect him to outplay all those  dudes. AD would need to be the difference maker and I don’t trust him…but I trust Giannis to at least fully exploit the mismatch"
Holiday and Tucker were basically perfect acquisitions for them. I clowned on them for trading away so many picks for Jrue but he’s just overwhelmingly better than Bledsoe.
Jrue sent them on an early Holiday and as a great man once said “Don’t play with your food”
"Let's be real here, Jrue is by far the biggest difference maker, and I say that with so much love for what PJ brings. It's just hard to overstate the upgrade from Bledsoe to the best Holiday brother, arguably the most underrated player in the game, in late game situations on both sides of the ball."
"Yeah. We lost some key role players, and I think by this point everyone understands Jrue Holiday is like a top 25 player. Bam’s problem is that he just wasn’t enough of an offensive presence. Not in the paint, on the boards, or shooting. He was scary worthless that series."
"Only jrue holiday should be up there.. the rest is seriously lol. Take Chris paul out, he is widely known to be one of the best ever."
"Not a Heat or Bucks, but I was predicting the Heat would win in realistically 4 games...or possibly 5 games. Never did I imagine the Bucks would win, let alone sweep the Heat. Last year, I was predicting the Bucks would beat the Heat in 5 games but they got completely manhandled. It was embarrassing to watch and I’m not a Bucks fan but I was so confident they were the better team. So for this year, I noticed how nothing changed. Same players, same coach = same result. Well, I was wrong. There were some changes: Jrue Holiday is a much better player than Eric Bledsoe. Home court advantage does matter when it’s not in a noiseless bubble. Jimmy Butler and the Heat started very slow this season due to injuries. Butler never seemed to be 100% or half as good as he was in 2020. That goes to show the wear and tear, the duress and extended postseason has on you.   Most importantly, it really goes to show the importance of those first two games. Last year, Miami dominated Milwaukee and won some close ones against the Bucks which affects your psyche. This year, that Game 1 OT win by the Bucks really changed the outcome of this series. I think if the Heat had won it, the Heat would’ve won this series. That Game 1 win by the Bucks finally gave them the confidence that they can beat the Heat. Meanwhile, it was a blow to the Heat for losing a gut-wrenching tightly contested game. The Bucks gained more confidence, the Heat lost some...and that dictated the rest of the series. And it can’t be oversold, Jrue Holiday is a much better player than Eric Bledsoe."
"Jrue “not Bledsoe” Holiday deserves some love, his plus/minus was INSANE."
And here we see all of the people who say Jrue Holiday is “underrated” unwilling to rate him any higher than what he’s normally rated
The Jrue Holiday effect.
"The power of good GMing! Jrue Holiday, Forbes, Tucker and Portis were all great additions."
Jrue Holiday made Tyler look like he was playing in BDSM.
And their starting PG isn't Eric Bledsoe. The Jrue Holiday effect vs Eric Bledsoe is like going from Kwame Brown to Tracy McGrady
Also Should have cursed Jrue Holiday with dark magic to act like Bledsoe
I still think Spolstras one of the best coaches in the NBA. This is just a different Bucks team with jrue holiday
Idk man.  The difference between this years Bucks and last years Bucks boils down to 1 Jrue Holiday. I think the difference between Lowry and Herro is &gt; the difference between Holiday and Bledsoe
"It wasn't fake, that shit happened. Bucks also added Jrue Holiday and gave Bledsoe the boot."
you don't care that they replace ERIC BLEDSOE averaging 12/6/5 on 33% FG and 24% from three with Jrue Holiday??   instead of Korver (retired)   Marvin Williams (retired)   they had Portis and PJ???
"Everyone should give the Bucks credit for improving and changing the gameplan instead of this narrative of ""bubble flukes."" Jrue Holiday over Bledsoe is a world of difference and Giannis and Lopez have been much more dominant in the paint. Jimmy Butler got straight up exposed though I can't front."
"&gt;a Jrue Holiday  also starring Bobby Portis  also starring Bryn Forbes,   executive producer much better coaching"
"From The Athletic:  &gt; **“We dogs,” Tucker said. “That’s all we talk about. That’s all I ever talk about. We gotta be dogs. People’s perceptions of us and what people think in the past, we’re erasing all of that. We’re coming out every night focused, not shying away from moments. I wasn’t here. Jrue wasn’t here. Bobby, we got a bunch of new guys in addition to everybody that’s been here. We’re just bringing that mentality and that’s what it’s about. Carrying that mentality every game, every possession, every day.”**  PJ Tucker has helped transform this team - we are dogs now.  [source (paywall)](https://theathletic.com/2618656/2021/05/28/jrue-holiday-and-a-mentality-change-is-whats-different-about-the-bucks-this-year-we-dogs-thats-all-we-talk-about/)"
"He is so steady, underappreciated everywhere and underrated that I almost thought he is from San Antonio Spurs.  Hell, Jrue Holiday also deserves huge praise."
"Damn, Heat fans gonna get clowned for this but the Bucks were just too damn good with Jrue Holiday"
I had a friend that’s a heat fan tell me Jrue Holiday wouldn’t make a difference smfh
"The Bucks are for real, and I think they're now the favorites in the East, and maybe to win it all. Adding Jrue Holiday has transformed that team  I've been skeptical about the Bucks the last two postseasons, but I think they're proving it right now. Don't sleep on them"
Jimmy Buckets should be Jimmy Cuckets. Getting outplayed by Jrue Holiday. Yikes.
Jrue Holiday cancelled their cancun holiday....
Jrue holiday is so nice.
"The Bucks have a great defense to handle Jimmy, and Brook Lopez pitching a tent in the paint. Context matters. Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Giannis, PJ Tucker, Donte Divicenzo, and Brook committing a defensive 3 seconds every possessions will kill any star without a 3pt shot."
Jrue Holiday  Kyrie  Durant  AD  Bam Adebayo
"Biggest changes I can think of:  -Butler less effective as a scorer with Giannis and Tucker on him -Brook outplaying Bam significantly this season after they were fairly evenly matched last year - impact on both the glass and rim scoring -Brook playing inside a bit more  -Jrue Holiday has been Bucks best player this series, much more effective than Bledsoe.   -Middleton more efficient with a smaller offensive load, due to Jrue taking over a lot of the ballhandling Middleton did last year.  No longer does Middleton have to initiate so much offense and so he can focus more on attacking mismatches -Heat are much colder from the perimeter.  Honestly doesn't matter so much for outcome - Heat were still much hotter than the Bucks in game one, but the Bucks margin of victory in games two and three helped by Heat being much colder -Portis struggling on defense just like Marvin Williams did, but PJ Tucker probably better than Connaughton was last year.  Very foul prone by Tucker, but tough to score on -Heat issues have snowballed and they have looked less confident than last year, less hot from the field, role players not playing as well.  Dragic has been solid this series, but much worse than last year, Herro not making any impact with Butler being limited as a playmaker -Ariza a big downgrade from Crowder and Forbes has been able to hide on defense due to poor offensive play of Ariza.  Giannis is still struggling vs. Heat defense, they still have found a way to make him less effective on offense.  Bucks just less reliant on him and Middleton due to addition of Jrue."
Jrue holiday would make so many teams contenders man the more I watch him the more amazing he is. Id kill to hv him w Murray in our back court but alas
Jrue holiday is a dog
Jrue holiday man. Elite defender and don’t have to rely on Giannis which we have weapons against. Middleton as the third option is just deadly. That’s being said Heat in 7
Giannis less on ball. Jrue holiday way better than Drew. Middleton can make big shots. Portis is excellent off the bench. Heat are bubble boys.
I believe the biggest difference is replacing one Eric Bledsoe with a Jrue Holiday
Yessir you make a great point   *Goes to sleep dreaming about Udonis Haslem Crossing up Jrue Holiday Banking a halfcourt game winner in Game 7 of what has somehow became the NBA Finals Against the 98 Bulls*
"Lol jrue holiday and rondo as defenders, ad at the rim. Cj and nurkic invisible. Yes it’s all dame’s fault"
"I would definitely say in the 16-19 range. A lot of this really depends on a team eyeing a specific player. For example: let’s say the Rockets had picks #23 and #24 in the 2009 draft and they really wanted to draft Jrue Holiday. They would instantly pull the trigger and trade those 2 picks to draft their guy at 17. (Jrue Holiday actually was drafted with the 17th pick by the way in 2009). But even if he was available at #20, the Rockets would still trade #23 and #24 to get Holiday if they felt a team would take him with picks #21 and #22.   The value of the picks also depend on how deep the draft is too. This upcoming draft is being hyped up to be one of the deepest drafts in decades. So it may be tough to try and snag the 15th pick in this draft with so much talent in the top 20. Teams may value the 15th pick higher than the 10th pick in last years draft. Btw last year the 10th pick was used to get Jalen Smith and the 8th pick was used to get Obi Toppin.   Sorry for the long post, I hope I made some sense."
Jrue Holiday would prob lock up your favorite  player lol...so underrated smh
Definition of insanity. The fact that dame has basically proclaimed that he'll never leave also doesn't help. Look at what the bucks did to ensure Giannis re-signed. Jrue freaking holiday who has transformed the team.   Dame needs to put more pressure on that franchise and quit with the loyalty nonsense or both parties ain't winning shit.
"I didn’t push him over Kobe. I gave you a fact but you’re a hater so of course you’re looking for reasons to justify why you have ho tendencies.  Surely you’re not saying Pat Bev in a gentleman’s sweep is major. Surely you’re not saying Jrue Holiday in a sweep is major. Surely Mike Conley missing one game and coming back to play better isn’t what you’re talking about, but you are. You see I watch games and know the context. Why were they not the favorites if it was so obvious? He beat everybody else on the 1st team that year on his way to his first ring.  Surely Tragic Bronson never happened, surely the Lakers Pistons never happened, surely the Heat Mavs never happened. None of these players great anymore according to you ?  Surely signing the biggest free agent is something literally any team would do given the opportunity right ?  Averaged 32PPG on efficiency Kobe literally never saw in his career and you want to knock it because of what ? Because you hate him and discredit everything he does. You deny it because you recognise it’s stupid af lol. Why not just stop ?  Kobe was my favorite player from 02-09. You see I can appreciate great play because I love basketball and actually played it.   You’re a casual my man. Imagine having nothing but disdain for a guy with a career as incredible as this man lol. And then claiming to be a knowledgeable basketball fan. Clown shit."
"Lol. You went from elite to now great? The gap between passing between KD and Kyrie and Giannis and Jrue Holiday is NOT large enough to substantiate your argument.   A good offense is a good offense, and the Clippers good offense has kept them in games where they shouldn’t have been considering Mavs are shooting HISTORICALLY well from 3 right now.  Sure, if your argument comes down to creation in the clutch. But the Clippers struggles have been with stopping Luka. If they could do that, they would be CF bound easily."
"Jrue Holiday is a good passer, not elite. The Bucks have one of the best offenses ever.   The Nets before Harden have one of the best offenses ever.   And the Clippers do as well. In fact, the issue with the Clippers isn’t really their offense. Their ranked 2nd these playoffs. It’s their defense.   Ooof…"
We're all capable of recency bias. The matchup last year weighed heavily in people's mind.  Add the perception of fucking up the Bogdan sign-and-trade with 'overpaying' for Jrue Holiday. I do believe there are more people picking the Bucks but they would just keep adding the context of it's going to be close series.  I have blind faith in the bucks because I think they are a good team that was poorly coach the last two years. The East was always a three-team race between the Nets Philly and Milwaukee. It sucks to lose Donte but they have a good shot as anybody to make the finals.
Jrue Holiday and AD combined for 88 points Game 4 2018 against the Blazers
Jrue Holiday is gonna put Kyrie in solitary
Imagine Jrue holiday on the Celtics instead of kemba man   Smh
"Holiday is our best (if not our only) bet against Harden. You're hilariously ignorant. Whoever isn't guarded by Holiday (either Kyrie or Harden) will feast, we don't have solid defensive guards other than Donte and Jrue. Do you understand why this injury is a problem now? dO yOu wAtCh bAsKeTbALL? Clown."
I wouldn't say he's really loved but I've never seen anyone hate on Jrue Holiday.
"Seriously we mostly all have the dude somewhere  12-15. He’s having a bad series against a top 5-7 player in the league and a team that’s been the one seed for the 2 years before and added Jrue Holiday.   This series eliminates any outside thought I had of him entering the tier of the top 11, but he’s still done more than anyone in his tier. I had him 12th, but I probably slide Kyrie over him now because I think Kyrie has improved his defense and efficiency this season as well."
Jrue Holiday is really just an absurd upgrade over Bledsoe and the Bucks robbed NO. Everyone who thought it was the other way should eat some crow.
"&gt;Nets don't make the finals after a loss to Philly in ECF  Nets lose to Bucks in 2nd round. No one on the Nets is able to slow down Giannis. Bucks have 3 great defenders in PJ Tucker, Jrue Holiday and Giannis."
"Before LeRef support, A.Davis was not able to lift his team to playoffs for so many years even though he had Jrue Holiday, prime-Cousins with him. NOP roster was not great but it could've do better if A.Davis had the same REF support."
"dude has gotten noticeably softer on court when reacting to hits while tougher dealing with injuries off the court and willing to fight through them. it's not salt it's just a statement of fact.   on the other hand jrue holiday requested a trade from my team and he's still exciting to watch. it's nothing to do with leaving / off the court, it's everything to do with on the court."
"Jason Kidd was like 37 and Khris Middleton is still in his prime. He’s putting up better numbers this year then he was in 2019 when he did make the ASG.  Same with Jrue Holiday, he’s much better this season then he was the year he made the ASG. But to be fair it was a pretty weak All-Star selection and it was way back in 2013.  Point is, making the ASG don’t really matter when May/June come around."
Damn those are jrue holiday numbers
"I think the best on-the-ball defender is Jrue Holiday, I genuinely don't think Kawhi has been that great defensively for years now."
"Yup, my sentiments as well. For Bucks, who the hell is gonna stop Jrue Holiday? KCP can't stop him, and I doubt Schroeder will either. If you put AD on Giannis, and Bron on Middleton, and either Gasol/Drummond on Brooke Lopez. Now that Divenzo is out for playoffs, Bryn Forbes is gonna probably start and that mofo can shoot lights out. I ain't gonna lie, I'm rooting for Lakers, but hope they get Nets rather than Bucks, because Nets defense is not on par with Bucks."
The other side of the coin was that we have more offensive threats than we did against Toronto.   Giannis was neutralized that series so it was Middleton as the only player who could get his own shot.   Now we have Jrue Holiday and Portis and other effective offensive threats to share that load
"Its sometimes disheartening though, if you talk to a casual fan of basketball not from Milwuakee, New Orleans, or maybe Philadelphia about Jrue Holiday youre more likely to get a ""who?"" Response than anything. I wouldnt be surprised if Kyle Kuzma had more name recognition, which is sad, bc a calender year ago he was a net negative player. Jrue's not the flashiest guy but has a really smart, physical game. Hope the Nets series can really make ppl aware of him if he can pull a Dort on Harden while hitting some clutch baskets."
You gotta have Jrue “not Bledsoe” Holiday on this list. His plus minus is INSANE and he’s not Bledsoe
"Simply put, Jimmy is not having a good series. Jrue Holiday has been the difference… as Bledsoe isn’t there to give the heat some possessions off this time around.  I hate the direction this team took letting Kelly, Bradley, Crowder (started last postseason) go and putting too much value in Tyler Herro. He should’ve been a part of a Harden, Beal, or even a Vucevic type offer this season.  Oladipo would’ve made a little difference on offense, but Bucks traded the assets necessary and it shows."
"Jrue, Aaron, and Justin Holiday would ball out together"
"&gt;In the real world it's hard to point to ways that they definitively should have done this or that and then actually be able to prove that they could have done that thing if they wanted to.  This is kind of the problem people look for definitive proof of ""Well they couldve done this specific thing"" and if its not 100% concrete then they use the idea of plausible deniability of ""Well we dont know for sure if that couldve happened"". Which before long people run with and turn it into ""there is nothing else they couldve really done in this spot"" because that's convenient.   Reality is over the span of 5 yrs their track record speaks for itself. Gave out awful free agent contracts in 2016 that crippled them. Have been content running back largely the same core for 4-5 yrs. Never been viably involved in trade talks for any really good player(not even a Kawhi but a Jrue Holiday type). Their big ""all in move"" was trading for Robert Covington. Have never shown any interest in actually seriously trying to pursue a title in Dame's prime. Which guess what that involves risks, but not even trying and being content running back dead end 47 win teams isnt it at all.   You can nitpick any specific move and say ""Oh well circumstances were this and this"" and ""that's why it wasnt that bad"" etc. Over the course of 5 yrs however the evidence is what it is and doing this is just not living in line with reality."

"Jrue ""can make a three unlike bledsoe"" Holiday."
"Embiid vs Jokic is such a fun debate. On one hand Embiid is a superior defender, but on the other hand, Jokic is an offensive engine who elevates his teammates' games. If your team has someone who can dictate the pace and flow of an offense a la Jrue Holiday or Mike Conley, then I see how you pick Embiid. On the other hand, if need someone who can elevate the players on the floor to that next level with a team being primarily composed of shooters, defenders, and no primary playmakers, I see how Jokic is an easy choice. It's a treat for us as fans to have two supremely talent but unique centers playing at the same time."
Jrue Holiday has converted me to a believer. What a baller
I am not big fan of the bucks but I love Jrue holiday very underrated player.  Trading for this guy has to be one of the best of season move. He will be great help against the Nets. Can see him bother kd or harden. Dude is a stud
He did have 25 in game 1 and 18 in game 2 though. Going up against Jrue Holiday is rough for the 35 year old.
And people still want to pretend def and offense us a 50/50 when it's really more like 80/20.  You know who else we're supposedly elite def wings? Kawhi n pg and what is luka doing? Oh right.  Giannis is the 3rd best player on his team right now in this series. Jrue holiday and middleton are destroying the heat.
"W jrue being more ball dominant, this series they were able to put giannis on jimmy without worrying ab him expending his energy too much on offense.  Fucking jrue holiday I hate jrue holiday. The perfect point guard to have on a championship team"
"I love Jrue Holiday, and I'm not even a Milwaukee or Pelicans fan"
an actual god. i am building my jrue holiday shrine immediately
Marv: jrue holiday needs to be quicker on these free throws
"Jrue Holiday decided it was time for the gentrification of Heat Culture, and moved the Bucks in."
Jrue Holiday has a blood pact to return to New Orleans to seed the next generation of basketball legend via ritual orgy and goat sacrifice
"After whatever next game brings for Miami (undoubtedly another L) I will be rooting for jrue holiday. Dude is just an amazing player and , from everything I hear, an amazing person. Super excited to see a bucks vs nets match up. after the huge let down for Miami Im still excited as ever for play off basketball"
"No? We're just saying he was important, especially against the Bucks. He was integral to our Giannis wall and was hot from 3. The other big thing if the Bucks have Jrue Holiday instead of Bledsoe."
"Yes, the upgrade from Eric Bledsoe who absolutely sucks to Jrue Holiday who is an All Star Caliber player is a big deal.  The loss of Jae Crowder is also a really big deal.  Not to mention Miami just got really hot at the right time, that wasn’t who they were all season."
Jrue Holiday was +41 tonight.
Jae Crowder and the Bucks having Jrue Holiday instead of Bledsoe.
Jrue Holiday and PJ Tucker have made the Bucks an absolute defensive juggernaut
"Jrue Holiday is an upgrade from Eric Bledsoe in *literally every way* and it makes the Bucks a much better team than they've been in years prior.   Nets vs. Bucks could really end up being the best series we get all playoffs, and it's coming in the second round lmao."
"It’s terribly sad how underrated Jrue Holiday was coming into the season. People were questioning whether he would be sufficient upgrade from Bledsoe when, in reality, Bledsoe’s *mere absence* would be a plus for the Bucks in the playoffs. Of course they would improve with Jrue."
Well you added Jrue Holiday which is playing a big role too
Jrue Holiday.
Hot take. Alex Caruso is a better perimeter defender than Jrue Holiday. Holiday overall better defender because he can bang down low. But still. Bald mamba no respect.
Jrue Holiday. Big man.
"How should this nets team be good enough, if you neutralize giannis and KD the bucks have the 2 next best players in the series. Unless you mean to tell me Joe Harris and Blake griffin is comparable to Khriss Middleton and Jrue Holiday."
"Aged like milk my dear casual nephew   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard"
"So my dear Casual nephew, as I told  Here the results   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard  https://mobile.twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1404574866418900999"
YESSIR JRUE HOLIDAY!!
"You really don’t realize how good young Gary was becoming do you? Elite defender, elite cutter, 40% from 3 and a clean midrange game for a young player, he want that different from Jrue Holiday at the same age. His career completely collapsed after that, but how soon you casuals forget.  He was the 2nd best player on a 46 win team at 23, he was pretty good man."
(Not in any order): 1.Dame 2.steph 3. Trae  4.Luka  5.kemba 6. Lowry 7. Ben Simmons  8. Brogdon 9. Jamal Murray 10. Kyrie 11. Paul 12. Ja morant 13. Mike Conley 14. Lamelo ball 15. Jrue holiday  16. Shai Alexander  16. Fox &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Westbrook
Bruh what.    In what world is the (non-Kyrie/Harden) Nets supporting cast better than Jrue Holiday and Middleton?!
"Bullshit lol. If Grayson Allen did this the sub would be at his throat. If Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday did this, there’d likely be a similar reaction to Jokic, with the majority questioning if it was truly worthy of an ejection. It’s about reputation and the history of a particular player, but I guess that doesn’t sound as profound as writing it off as a symptom of grand societal racism. Maybe you could argue that subtle racism can influence a player’s reputation and you might have a point, but pretending this sub thinks white player commits an intentional foul=clean and black player commits an intentional foul=dirty is pretty laughable."
&gt;sees something with the Bucks?  I see 2x MVP and 1x DPOY  2x all star  and Jrue Holiday.
I love how over possessive Pelican fans are about Jrue Holiday.

Giannis lets jrue holiday guard KD because hes scared to get his ankles taken. Bucks are frauds against real contenders consistently
"I was going to go with Jrue Holiday is top-5 in blocks for the franchise, 3 behind Chandler for 4th, and 65-ish behind Emeka Okafor for 3rd, but yours works to."
"&gt;As Jrue Holiday admitted, a defender with a good reputtion gets away with more.  Not always. I’ve seen guys like Thybulle rack up 4-5 fouls in 20 minutes of play. Dort did too last season.  &gt;There is no consistency in the NBA, regardless of whether you think PJ 'knows when' to be physical (literally the most vague statement ever).  I’m not sure how that’s vague. Great perimeter defenders don’t exert 100% of their energy at every stage of a play. They know when to swipe without handchecking, jump the passing lanes without getting burnt, stay lateral without getting overpowered, etc.  I assumed this was common sense."
"An interesting twist of fate that after starting his career with the Bucks, Tobias Harris could end up playing against them in the ECF. And vice versa for Jrue Holiday."
"Lmao keep repeating this bullshit. There are clearly defined rules in the NBA on where you can touch the offensive player. As Jrue Holiday admitted, a defender with a good reputtion gets away with more.   Also PJ got called for soft first two fouls yet didn't get called for more physical ones. There is no consistency in the NBA, regardless of whether you think PJ 'knows when' to be physical (literally the most vague statement ever). Refs manipulate the game all the time using this grey area, they can call soft fouls based on the rules and they can also let hard fouls slide based on the typical 'playoff, let them play' excuse."
"KD, Blake, and Joe Harris                  Or    Giannas, Middleton, and the immortal Jrue Holiday"
"&gt; he's always hurt and in street clothes. And it's a fact. Guys consistently injured every year.   He's really not. He might get the occasional minor injury here and there, just like many players in the league, but this idea that he's ""consistently injured every year"" is just false. He had a bunch of injuries early in his career, but so did virtually everyone on those Pelicans teams (Eric Gordon, Tyreke Evans, Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Ryan Anderson, etc), and it's probably because the Pelicans were the only team in the league that didn't have their own training or medical staff. Instead they were just borrowing the football guys from the Saints to handle that, no joke.   AD's injury this year was not only the biggest injury of his career, but was his first major injury in 5 years, and I'm guessing the 6 week off-season probably had something to do with it. People just want to laugh at the Lakers is all this is."

No one asked for this but here are some nicknames I have given to players:  - Robin Lopez: Caveman - Brook Lopez: Cavebrother - PJ Tucker: Uncle Tuck - Cauley-Stein: Prison Fresh - Jrue Holiday: Lil’ Yachty
"Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday"
KD you’re 7 feet how you gonna let Jrue Holiday block you?
Bucks and Pelicans fans   🤝   Respect for Jrue Holiday
"""*I'll give myself my own low five.*"" - Jrue Holiday"
"Idk how people can watch Jrue Holiday play basketball and be like ""Yeah, he's nice""."
As with all things even the Nets lights out shooting was going to regress to the mean. Now if only Jrue Holiday could get going
Jrue holiday is just an elite defender.
Mike James outplaying Jrue Holiday this series
Jrue Holiday is not a star and we’re seeing why right now
gonna be real awkward when Jrue Holiday puts up worse playoff numbers than Eric Bledsoe
Giannis' supposed lack of skill &amp; Bud's coaching have been the stories of this series but Mike James outplaying Jrue Holiday has somehow flown under the radar. That's why he isn't and never will be a star.  A star PG would be getting slaughtered by the media &amp; fans.
Because he’s being guarded by Jrue holiday.
Jrue Holiday is not it
jrue holiday has an underrated handle
Jrue Holiday is a more aggressive Eric Bledsoe.
"Yep. Unless you're pelicans or okc a la Paul George, jrue holiday, or Anthony davis"
Bucks have a big 2. If that. Jrue holiday in this series hasn’t scored more then 17 points and hasn’t had more than 6 assists. Not even all star level if you ask me. And Jrue is supposedly a defensive specialist but has been getting cooked all series. Sorry but he ain’t “Big 3” material
"Jrue Holiday, DeMarcus Cousins, Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, Austin Rivers, Rondo, Lopez.   He wasn’t playing with all scrubs lmao"
"What’s difference between the bucks trading for jrue holiday and nets trading for harden? Lmao  Both teams went all in on who they thought was worth it   Also sixers could have had harden   Bucks was on harden list   They went all in on jrue holiday and sixers didn’t wanna trade maxley   Who’s fault is that?? Not the nets   The suns traded for Chris Paul, if they had kept assets they could have traded for harden   Blame the teams involved for lack for incompetence not the nets lol"
"The series is still 2-1 so you can claim that they have some chance against Nets. The problem is Nets having a healthy Durant. People don't talk too much about this but the way he showed up against Bucks, **KD is the best player in the NBA**. He showed that against Lebron before when he shot 3s in the NBA Finals against lebron's face. Even with one leg he was going to beat Kawhi and Raptors if he didn't get that achilles injury. Fortunately,  he is back again and still playing at elite level.  Harden has led his team to WCF many times by himself. Kyrie is known to be clutch in playoffs. Even Blake lifted his team to playoffs before with Clippers and with Detroit (2019). So arguably, Nets have actually co-stars that carried their teams before. Jrue Holiday struggled to make playoffs with AD-Zion. Middleton can not be trusted to lead team scoring, or creating offense. Nets roster seem to have that elite talent, and Bucks had the second-tier ones.  So for a playoff series, when the things got hard, it becomes hard for Bucks to win over Nets roster. I don't think any other coach would change this fact."
"Ibaka is done for the season with some kind of surgery. The clippers wouldn't beat them even if they had him. The way I see it, you need someone that can have huge performances, with the other starters chipping in. The suns AND jazz both have that, but I would take the jazz. Mitchell was thought of as a good player, but now he's capable of getting 50. If he averages north of 35 while the starters getting 55-65 points, it could work. They can't lock Mitchell down, just like they can't lock KD down. Kyrie is looking kind of average rn and jrue holiday isn't even nullifying him, so if its anyone its the jazz."
Nah that guy blows too. You need to get a solid player like jrue holiday or Derrick rose
"Yep, New Orleans *finally* hired their own training and medical staff back in the summer of 2019 after literally years of just borrowing the football guys from the Saints. I've always felt like them not using actual basketball experts was a big part of why so many of their players got hurt every year (Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Anthony Davis, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, etc).   As for the Suns this year, I think at least part of the credit for their health should go to the long layoffs they had last year. They had 113 days off from the stoppage in March till the bubble training camp started in July. Then they had a month of training together, played two weeks worth of games, and then got another 131 days off until this season started. Between having 9 months off like the teams that weren't invited to the bubble and only getting 6 weeks off like some teams in the bubble, I think Phoenix had an absolutely ideal setup coming into this season."
"Tony Allen, Jrue Holiday, Pat Beverly, Avery Bradley,"
As much as a like Lowry the guard position is stacked.   Curry (50/50) Dame (very likely)  Booker (likely) Beal   And one might argue if they wanted a defensive guard they’d take Jrue Holiday.
He pushed PJ in order to get in between him and KD the same way that Bruce Brown and Jrue Holiday did. He was more aggressive about it but he also shut down the confrontation immediately. Once the bodyguard got there PJ immediately went into “hold me back” mode but directed at the guard instead of KD. Isn’t that the job?
you people gave AD shit for not being able to beat the all time warriors with jrue holiday and filler. Lets see what the tone is like when giannis loses to the nets with jrue AND middleton.
"Here's what they each did FWIW.  **Carmelo Anthony**  &gt; Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade created the Social Change Fund in July 2020. The organization works to address social and economic issues facing Black communities. Anthony is also a member of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition.   **Harrison Barnes**  &gt; Before the 2020 presidential election, Barnes worked with Be.Woke.Vote, a voting campaign aimed at historically disenfranchised young people. He also pledged $200,000 to organizations and foundations that combat police brutality and racial inequality. The 29-year-old also is partnered with a Black-owned finance app and opened savings accounts for 500 students in Dallas and Sacramento.   **Tobias Harris**  &gt; Harris awarded $300,000, through the Tobias Harris Charitable Fund, to The Fund for the School District of Philadelphia to recruit teachers from historically Black colleges and universities. He also created the Tobias' Top Teachers program, which funds professional development workshops and purchases classroom supplies for teachers to help recruit Black male educators.   **Jrue Holiday**  &gt; Holiday established the Jrue and Lauren Holiday Social Impact Fund in response to COVID-19 and global anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd. The fund provided grants to 50 Black-owned businesses and Black-led organizations in New Orleans, Indianapolis and Los Angeles.   **Juan Toscano-Anderson**  &gt; Toscano-Anderson created the Journey to Achieve Foundation to help Black people across California and Mexico. He was also a part of the Warriors' Voters Win campaign during the 2020 election."
"They need a guard who can create. It's glaring. Imagine if they had a Chris Paul instead of Jrue Holiday or Middleton. Those guys are good players, but a Giannis team needs a creator - because he can't do it."
First people who come to mind would be Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday
Tobias Harris or Jrue Holiday.   Wish they called it literally anything else but the “Social Justice” award. That’s a trigger phrase so unnecessarily for a lot of people.   These guys all do good shit for communities and do it in the right way. But I think Jrue and Tobias stand out.
he has absolutely destroyed jrue holiday in the post this series. thats the type of guy who gave him trouble earlier in his career (tony allen/cp3). He gets super low and just bodies them and then shoots his turnaround.
"I usually never watch games, since the time difference is too big but for this game I decided to watch it, since the stakes were so high.  Needless to say, Milwaukee was ass. Giannis may have put up 30+ but some of the shots he was taking were just awful. Every time he pulled up for a three, I cringed. The only bright spot for them in this game was Middleton and god knows what's up with Jrue Holiday on offense. This is probably the luckiest win I have ever witnessed, and it basically took KD to have his worst game ever for the nets, alongside bruce brown and harris just bricking every shot imaginable."

"Ayy, it's Jrue Holiday.   He got hoes on hoes   And they out of control  Ayy, it's another way   All these bucks on the go and he hope that you know it     He can't even close his eyes   Or Giannis lets it fly, guess he don't like surprises   He can't even stay away from the game that he play   They gon' know him today, yeah"
Jrue holiday is absolutely a reliable playoff scorer
"You aren’t reading what I’m writing clearly   Bryn Forbes+Connaughton+Portis 40 minutes, 6 points   Is it unreasonable to ask them to put 15 up?   Is it unreasonable to Lopez and Tucker to combine for 20 points? Jrue Holiday to score more than 9?"
Neither team deserved to won but good job Jrue Holiday for scoring that big bucket
These bums fought back down from 21 just to give up a game winning spinning layup to Jrue Holiday
Jrue holiday saved our day
Jrue Holiday deserved to let loose like Sam Cassell with the big balls
Jrue Holiday had been doing is best Eric Bledsoe impression up until this possession.
JRUE HOLIDAY GAD DAMNNNNNNN
bucks legend jrue holiday
JRUE HOLIDAY
Jrue Holiday
WHAT ABOUT JRUE HOLIDAY BEING ANOTHER BLEDSOE?!!
Jrue holiday playing so scared it’s hard to watch
All I know is…  Jrue Holiday is doing his best Eric Bledsoe impression. The Bucks offense seems to be dependent on his rhythm.
"Holy shit did somebody tell the bucks it was Halloween before this game? Cause they came to *brick-or-treat* tonight!  Also Jrue Holiday's last name is holiday, and Halloween is a holiday. Just imagine I worked that shit in there too somehow."
Jrue Holiday has been so disappointing offensively
Unfortunately. Jrue Holiday ISOs
jrue holiday
I dislike Jrue Holiday so much lol. His game is stupid.
jrue holiday has been complete garbage all game
You guys weird. Darling of this sub Jrue holiday shooting the bucks almost out of the game but Giannis ans Middleton getting the hate
"Jrue Holiday is just a glorified Bledsoe. Maybe it's Bud's trash system, but it's just wild that it all falls apart in the postseason no matter who they add. Must be a detriment on their star players and coach."
Not sure if thats jrue holiday or eric bledsoe??
Is that Jrue holiday out there or Bledsoe I can’t tell?
People were swearing Jrue Holiday would be the reason after Giannis that the Bucks would win a chip lol
Jrue Holiday Garbage Tonight
Jrue Holiday sucks lol
Jrue Holiday and Bledsoe no-showing in the playoffs for the Bucks after getting contract extensions
Milwaukee traded 2 first round picks for PJ Tucker. And 3 first round picks for Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday taking a holiday this series
Jrue Holiday has been nothing this series.
And about Jrue Holiday.
The fact Giannis has attempted more threes than Jrue Holiday tells you everything you need to know about the Bucks
jrue holiday morphed into eric bledsoe
So why did Jrue Holiday sign that extension?    If I was him i woulda dipped to an LA team or Philly cus if Akumpo your first option in the playoffs u gonna be in a world of pain
Jrue Holiday with 5 pts on 8 shots. Where you at bro
"For bucks fans - as a pelicans fan I love Jrue Holiday and think he’s a fucking amazing player. Avoiding knee-jerk reactions after a subpar performance so far today, do you think Jrue was the piece you needed to win rings?   Obviously this series looks tough atm, but even if you go out, how would you feel going into next year?"
Jrue holiday has been so bad this game
"Jrue holiday seems overrated tbh. Giannis and Middleton showed up, everyone else is ass."
Jrue holiday step the fuck up !
So jrue holiday isn’t really making much of an impact like everyone expected with when they got him. Not doing much on offense (like they need) or defense (a big surprise/ contrary to reputation).  What’s going on there
But can he do it against Jrue Holiday in the playoffs?
"**First year after drafting AD:**  Traded for Ryan Anderson  Matched the Suns offer for Eric Gordon  Traded for Robin Lopez  **Season 2:**  Traded Nerlens Noel and a 1st for Jrue Holiday  Traded for Tyreke Evans  **Season 3:**  Traded a 1st for Omer Asik  Traded for Quincy Pondexter and Norris Cole  **Season 4**  Re-signed Ajinca, Asik, and Dante Cunningham to long term deals  **Season 5**  Signed E'Twuan Moore  Signed Solomon Hill  Traded for Boogie and Omri Casspi  **Season 6**  Signed Rajon Rondo  Traded for Nikola Mirotic  **Season 7**  Signed Julius Randle  Signed Elfrid Payton  ----  Many of these were not successful for various reasons through injury or our coaching staff just mis-judging the potential a player had who then failed to reach it after a huge contract.  But we made shit tons of deals and signings to try to surround AD with people who the coaching staff thought would be contributors.  Saying ""Free Agents dont want to go there"" is the entirely wrong conclusion to draw."
This one I think is also considerably more indefensible than 2012. Harden basically went for 1 extra firsts and 2 more pick swaps than Jrue Holiday it's kind of normalized now 5 years from now people will look back at that with the proper level of amazement
"Bucks are contenders right? Regular season is all about getting set for a run to the finals so, no, it’s not “ignorant”.  You know it was Kawhi who coined the phrase right? Maybe consider what I’m saying before you jump on me to defend your fraud team.  And DJA is and always has been trash. Your FO vastly overpaid for (the legend of) Jrue Holiday and had some hand in the BB mess. The rise of the bucks is directly attributable to Giannis reaching next level god status.   It’s fine for benches to be streaky athletes but you need leadership off the bench and a good 6th man should be able to credibly start and contribute. Y’all got nada. Pat and Portis? Lolz."
"They absolutely could have, but Jrue is a better fit next to Giannis and young enough to play with Giannis for the next 4-5 years. Jrue is a good defender and doesn't need the ball in his hands.  He's a shooter.  The other guy they wanted was Bogdan, another shooter.  Paul is more of an on-ball guy and would have taken the ball away from Giannis (which maybe wasn't a bad thing since it would have given them a second option in the half-court when Giannis was sitting?)  It wasn't insane, they were trying to surround Giannis with 4 shooters (Lopez, Middleton, Bogdan, and Holiday) and then run everything through Giannis which is exactly what everyone told them to do.  IDK, maybe they can still get Eric Gordon?  He should be available and shouldn't cost the moon. He's still young enough to pair with the other guys. He's not too expensive either.  Maybe Oladipo?"
Jrue Holiday
Shouldn't be singlehandedly depending on Jrue Holiday to get a win with an all star and a borderline all star starting every game pretty much
"Yes, how the hell does signing Jrue Holiday convince you to sign your career away"
"Ok, so now Giannis is stuck on a team that’s ceiling relies on Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday, 2 guys that are not all-nba caliber players, with zero bench, zero cap space, and zero picks. If they are subpar, that’s kinda it for the Bucks. They have no freedom moving forward. I shit you not, that massive trade for Jrue would have pushed me away from re-signing because now I know exactly where the team stands moving forward. I think it was a desperate move. They could very well be a 2nd round exit for the next 5 years."
"Do you not think it would have been reasonable to say to Giannis “hey, we are willing to put together a great package together for a player, right now Jrue Holiday is available, but in 6 to 12 months, someone who’s much better is likely to become available for a similar package”? ... I have a hard time thinking he said “yup, go all in for Jrue Holiday. That’s what will keep me here”.  It’s like not like Jrue Holiday is this proven playoff threat. You can seriously make a case that the team will do worse."
"Jesus christ stop spreading this narrative that just because Dame got swept by the Pelicans and Warriors his accomplishments are diminished. In the Pelicans series he got doubled on every single possession by Jrue Holiday, and in the warriors series we were missing Nurk (and the Warriors were the Warriors). In fact after the Pelicans series he became more skilled dealing with double teams and became an even better player hence why the year after he went to the western conference finals. As a blazers fan who watches all his games this is just a terrible take."
"If Jrue Holiday leaves, what are the Bucks going to do? They're missing their 2022, 2024, 2025, and 2027 first round picks, have no picks in 2026, and their team is somewhat older."
Their choices:  1. Give a 31 yr old Jrue Holiday 30M/yr   2. Thye're completely fucked.
"In a superstars league, Jrue Holiday is not a superstar and might not be worth trading all that depth and future flexibility with trades for."
"Solid defense from a 23-year-old. Not elite yet. I wouldn't put him on Simmons/Schroder tier, or anywhere near Jrue Holiday-tier, but I think he's a natural on that side of the ball. Zo can be a downright pest at times.  The difference to me between 'naturally great defender' and 'elite' is honestly... *tape study, tape study, tape study*.  I think Jrue studies the shit outta his matchups (he definitely made adjustments next time he met Luka) and from what I've seen of Schroder, he seems like he does too. You can't rest around those kind of defenders because they read you too well. Rodman/Dray kind of elite defensive BBIQ."
Dont forget that they have to pay Jrue Holiday this summer and he has all the leverage.
"&gt; Get Giannis his Robin. It's not Jrue Holiday. It's not Khris Middleton.  I mean they don't really have anything to give, so they'd have to lure somebody there via free agency and clear out a bunch of cap space.  It's not just those guys, Giannis is likely going to go into the playoffs with the same glaring flaw in his offense that he's had for two full seasons now.  I don't understand how that's not a huge problem."
"I respect Giannis decision to stay in Milwaukee but now that he's committed, they need to step it the fuck up. This is clearly not a contender as currently constructed when you are facing teams with LBJ + AD, Harden + KD + Kyrie, or Kawhi + AD. Get Giannis his Robin. It's not Jrue Holiday. It's not Khris Middleton."
"We've only been telling you guys for years that no team is going to win s championship with Khris Middleton as a #2 then y'all traded a superstar package for Jrue Holiday and depleted your bench 🤷🏽‍♂️  But hey, at least Giannis won't be asking out because there's no pressure on him anymore because no one expects the Bucks to get past the Nets. So there's a silver lining in all of this."
"If Jrue Holiday leaves, this could be the worst trade in the NBA in the last half a decade"
So is there a chance Jrue Holiday doesn’t resign?  That would be crazy after the package Bucks gave for him
"Which of the Jazz's recent wins actually look good or great in hindsight? The Celtics are not very good, especially away from home. The Bucks are not very good at all without Jrue Holiday. The Heat clearly aren't very good. The Sixers just barely beat the Rockets, and that was with the MVP candidate."
Oh wait Jrue Holiday is out  Bucks still have hope
I don’t know if Jrue Holiday will fix the Bucks’ issues guys
"&gt;rarely any hate   If I had a dollar for every time someone brings up the Pelican series, Jrue Holiday himself, the Golden State sweep without KD, I'd be a rich man. I'm not saying any of the hate he gets is undeserved because there's plenty he can be criticized for, but this idea that he never gets hate or and criticism is brought up so much that it's an oxymoron at this point."
Bucks unprotected their 2022 pick (owned by Cavs) so they could trade the picks they needed to get Jrue Holiday
If you're gonna invoke the pelicans at least have the decency to shout out Jrue Holiday smh
"Yea dude the Clippers without their two stars. The 76erd without Embiid. The Bucks without Jrue Holiday.  And the struggling Heat and Celtics aren't exactly the strongest test on the planet.   I can tell you don't watch basketball and just saw Clippers, Bucks, Heat, 76ers, and Celtics and thought they were in a blood bath.  Context is important. Wouldnt expect much from a Celtics fan tho."
"Jazz have beat:  *@ Blazers  *Clippers  *@ Bucks  *Bucks  Celtics  *@ Spurs  @ Nuggets  *Warriors  *Mavericks  *Mavericks  @ Pacers  *Heat   *Led by 20  Only Marcus Smart, Goran Dragic, and Jrue Holiday are meaningful players that missed a game here. Jazz were missing Mitchell in both Dallas wins, Conley in the @ Pacers, Heat, Milwaukee, and Boston wins.  Jazz beat the spread in all of these games. Jazz beat the spread tonight. Jazz were missing Conley tonight again."
Dame saw we didn’t have Jrue Holiday anymore and decided he was gonna go off 😭
Boy do I miss Jrue Holiday more than ever.
the pels could use jrue holiday rn
"I'm not a Houston fan, but it was bad for them. Even though he was a cancer to the team, they still traded James Harden for Levert and 3 picks.   They should have traded for Simmons or waited until the offseason and got a haul. They ended up with Jrue Holiday value for a top 5 player."
"he has jrue holiday syndrome - he was underrated, but then people talk so much about how he's underrated that he becomes overrated  He's an ATG but he's definitely overrated now"
They're missing Jrue Holiday aren't they
Caruso is below average but he hustles.   Like wtf are you just disrespecting dudes who are actually balling out but have played on crap teams? Yah let's trade Jrue Holiday for him I'm sure he'll lead the Bucks to a title.
"Totally. When you see 3 first rounders and 2 swaps for Jrue Holiday, it gives an impression on what the smart GMs think of them. Great player and all, but the idea you just call up any team and swap a few 1sts for an all star is absurd."
The nba needs to see Jrue Holiday on the Pacers.
"It's not that offense is more important than defense, it's more so that an individual can usually impact offense more than an individual can impact defense. Every basket Curry scores or creates goes on his team score board. Jrue Holiday could legit hold his man scoreless and the rest of the team could bleed points anyways.   This is why for centers defense is more important because they usually have more impact on more plays. An elite rim protector makes it so teams struggle to score inside and reputation wise they make it so teams stop going inside period allowing more aggressive perimeter defense from teammates."
[Fking Jrue Holiday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ef9fdd/jewish_woman_at_blazers_game_on_hanukkah_night/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
But it doesn’t work against Jrue Holiday
"I keep calling out this sub for the Bol Bol infatuation when he gets garbage time highlights posted for just grabbing a rebound and starting the break or hitting a 3 and it's completely fine. Even to the point where this sub was pushing this narrative that Bol Bol and Gary Harris is enough for Jrue Holiday.  But then when the THT stuff was happening in preseason, this sub was getting so butthurt over his posted highlights."
You think jrue holiday is solving all their problems?
"That might be because Donovan is a more popular player and his best playoff moments are highly memorable (popping off vs the Nuggets, taking out the Thunder as a rookie) while the Bucks are known for their playoff disappointments. In reality, both guys have their share of gems and duds in the playoffs.   The Jazz haven't clinched the best record in the league, so until then Middleton has two more seasons of being the second best guy on the team with the best record. And from watching both of them this season, here are my takeaways.  * Khris is having his best season from an individual standpoint. He's shooting a little sharper, his defense is about the same, but his playmaking has taken a massive leap so far. Their record isn't as good because that's what happens when you trade your depth for Jrue Holiday. A lack of depth is exposing Bud's coaching before the playoffs this season especially since Jrue's missing some time.   * Donovan is about the same, maybe *slightly* better than last season. Maybe a Jazz fan will debate me here, but the Jazz improved so much because Gobert and Conley are playing better than they ever have. Snyder's system is also working to perfection and they're getting the most out of every role player.   * Don't have the time or IQ to articulate everything but Khris is a better shooter, playmaker, and defender. Mitchell is more explosive, a better high volume scorer, and has higher highs. It's quite close but I'd pick Middleton over Mitchell in a vacuum with some confidence."
"Agreed, but that isn't the point, haha.  See my other comment, my whole point is that you have very, very good players in this league for several years who are not multi-time all stars.  Lavine, Conley, Gobert, Booker, Jrue Holiday, etc. who are not multi-time all stars   It's never easy to be a multi-time all star.  To say it would be easy for Kevin Porter if he just gets his head figured out implies he is WAYYY better than those players from a basketball perspective which is just silly.  It's not easy for anyone to be a multi-time all star, and KPJ isn't such a prodigal talent that it would be true for him."
"I mean who would they trade giannis for? A 26 year old back to back MVP on a max contract with a team built around his skill set seems as untouchable as they come, no?   Edit: I disagree they aren’t trying to build around his skill set. They have a ton of shooters and traded for Jrue holiday who’s a really great fit with him."
"Jrue holiday, kemba, Middleton..."
Jrue holiday has shown he's pretty overrated. And James Harden looks like the best PG in the league.
Yeah I like Jrue but would you consider him a top 20 player?  That deal was similar to the Anthony Davis deal and  Brooklyn gave up less for Harden.  And I don't want to shit on Holiday he's a very good defender What I would consider a B level All Star.  And they gave future assets and this iteration of the team Isn't better than the last.
They have literally NO CAP SPACE while Kemba is on the Boston Celtics so it makes no sense not to add a player of Vuc’s caliber who could potentially get them to the finals. There’s not other available player with that talent available. And when you have the Jays those first rounders are meaningless. Look at MKE traded the next five years of picks for Jrue Holiday. Both of those players are likely to be all stars this year or close.
Wow I just looked it up and it's true that's pretty odd that a serb and a croatian.  Two countries that hate each other have these two guys that have damn near the same name and aren't related   Either way the results are still the same the Bucks gave up Way to many assets for jrue holiday and basically stripped away most of their bench depth and when the bagdonovic deal fell apart left them vulnerable. But if you want to believe one Serbian role player would be the difference then more power to you.
You need Jrue Holiday to beat a garbage tanking team missing 3 rotation players with Justin Jackson and Kenrich Williams starting? Lol
Dude put Bev over Jrue Holiday and Kris Dunn
i miss jrue holiday
It definitely would which is why I would be willing to live with alot of his limitations like defense and how he has issues vs higher level competition. But those medical red flags are just too much for me tbh I believe the reports that the Celtics tried to sell him this past offseason while they still could and were willing to attach the 14th and 23rd pick with him for Jrue Holiday. I think they know that it's probably gonna be trending down from here.
Jrue Holiday has entered he the chat
"The NBA wants more offence because it makes them more money. They would never do that, though I do think it would be very entertaining to watch a player like Jrue Holiday guarding a guy like KD with these rules"
Not sure about this but Jrue Holiday
"Yeah because there's no point in comparing them.  Anyone with a brain can see Jrue is the best Holiday, and Mason is the best Plumlee."
"There’s a massive difference between PG, AD, Westbrook compared to Jrue Holiday in case you didn’t know."
"Not really, I mean just look at what Milwaukee had to give up for Jrue holiday, a sub all star on an expiring contract, just to get Giannis to re-sign. The odds are always stacked against them."
Possibly yes: Brook Lopez for Joe Harris  Possibly no: Jrue Holiday for Mike Conley
Jrue Holiday/Bobby Portis
"&gt;past the AD  Jrue Holiday missed the series.  &gt;the Grit'n'Grind Grizz  Mike Conley missed the series.  &gt;and Harden and Howard in Houston  Pat Bev missed the series.  The Warriors were a team with an MVP at PG that didn't play a single healthy starting PG in the whole postseason, that's pretty fucking lucky. I had the Warriors winning headed into the playoffs anyway but they weren't only lucky playing the Cavs, everyone else they played was banged up just as severely in the position that mattered most."
"Really missin Jrue Holiday, fuck covid"
Jrue Holiday is way better than Bledsoe
I’ve been saying this. Jrue Holiday is not an All Star.
Yes and Malcom Brogdon is better than Jrue Holiday
I was just making a joke at trading Jrue Holiday lol
So we're talking about KAT last year pre deadline and I think his stock was a bit higher then than it is now. I do believe you could get a significant package (though somewhat smaller than AD) for KAT. You might be forgetting that KAT was chosen just a few years ago as the player GMs most wanted to build around. I think a team like Miami would easily have traded Hero + massive pick haul for him. Mavs could have done KP + a few picks and you could flip KP for a few more. Regardless it only takes a few GMs interested and you can go from there.   If Jrue Holiday is worth 5 picks to the Bucks what's KAT worth? Donte + 7 picks? Possibilities are endless because he's locked up for 5 years. Hell a team like the Kings could do Fox + picks. It'd be stupid but Valde was the GM so that sounds plausible.
I don't like jrue holiday
"AD and Pels made the playoffs that one year when they had Jrue Holiday and pre-injury Boogie. And still they sucked, 8th seed and got swept in first round."
"Just for clarification, I wasn’t ranking the best point guards. Just ranking the PGs I named. I believe Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday, and most Starting PGs are better than Patrick Beverley + Kemba Walker"
Bill declares the Jrue Holiday trade hasn't worked out lol. Picks from the Holiday trade go out until 2027.
NBA players say Jrue Holiday is the best
"i have really never seen anyone do that well on Dame in a long, long time. probably since jrue holiday in the 2018 pelicans series."
Jrue Holiday in the Playoffs.
Yall aren't even going to mention Jrue Holiday?
Jrue Holiday is a damn good on ball defender. Tough call between him and Simmons.  Simmons got the size I will give him that.
Jrue Holiday would beg to differ
"Jrue Holiday has been labeled a Point Guard for a good amount of time in his career. DiVincenzo is a 3rd year player and has never had Point Guard duties and ran the offense.  I’m not saying that the Point Guard has to be the player leading the team with Assists. But damn, they should average over 2.6 a game. Kyrie is at least still averaging 5.9 a game."
DiVincenzo averaging 2.6 Assists per game is the starting Point Guard and not Jrue Holiday averaging 5.4 Assists per game?
"He's arguably one of the quickest guard in the league.  His jumper has been great.  And his athleticism has been a crazy good surprise.  He's also not afraid of contact and can finish duty both hands.  He straight up challenged Embiid, Gobert and Myles Turner.  Even Conley couldn't stay in front of him, and Jrue Holiday struggled against him.  I think all signs are pointing to him being a star."
"&gt; I hate how “by themself” means on offense. Do the great defensive players on that team get credit for carrying the defense the way AI carried the offense? Nope.  I mean, that's just the nature of basketball. One guy can't carry a defense the way 1 guy can carry an offense. Not one thinks Gobert is more valuable than Jokic either, or that Marcus Smart or Jrue Holiday are more valuable than Curry and Dame."
"&gt;The NBA does not reveal which players test positive for COVID-19, but Milwaukee’s Khris Middleton said earlier this week that Bucks guard Jrue Holiday tested positive for the virus. That would make Holiday the one player in the NBA’s Wednesday announcement."
The Jazz blew this Bucks team out in Milwaukee when they had Jrue Holiday.
"In a blistering 13 game sample size, 4 of them being a not so great defensive Blazers team and even then he had Jrue Holiday who could at least create his own shots and Mirotic was very good at opening the lane up for him Drob didn’t get any of that. If you look at small sample sizes for Drob he has some monster series’ as well.  1991 where he averaged 26 on like +20 rTS with 14 rebounds and 4 blocks.  1995 against the Lakers he averaged 30 a game with 16 rebounds 4 blocks and a steal."
Jrue Holiday. Middleton slipped up and said he tested positive.
1. James Harden 2. Bradley Beal 3. Devin Booker 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jrue Holiday 6. CJ McCollum 7. Victor Oladipo 8. Seth Curry 9. Danny Green
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They’ll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn’t fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they’ve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won’t be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
"Over the offseason I remember seeing those rumors/rumblings that Danny offered Kemba +14th pick + 30th pick for Jrue Holiday and thinking that was insanity and that it had to be total bullshit. Looking back I believe it, that wasnt the only rumor of a Kemba deal either his health situation had been worse than fans were probably led on they knew the deal and tried to see if they could get ahead of things. Itll be better than the past 2 games with him it cant get any worse but this is gonna continue to be a problem."
"He is playing next to Giannis, reigning defensive player of the year and also Jrue Holiday who is arguably one of the best guard defenders in the league. I think his defense will be just fine. Can't be worse than Korvers."
Perks of being a Laker. Kuzma and Caruso are a lot more popular than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
"Jrue Holiday got 4 picks. Lowry’s just better. Idc if he’s older, if you’re trying to win Lowry will help your team more for the next 2-3 seasons."
"I just checked out the box score, I can see the problems for Nuggets:   \- Millsap and Barton are 30 and 39 minutes. Millsap is 35 year old, he's not the same player as decade ago. Barton has been horrible and he is a negative net.  \- Murray and MPJ are inconsistent. I think the injury is still nagging Murray and he scores 11 points without Jrue Holiday. MPJ is too raw as fuck, he's very young player and how little he got to play at NBA level.   \- They have no good single NBA caliber SF. Should they have traded Beal when Murray's value is high and MPJ was still value. Unfortunately, Murray's contact has a little trade value.   Nuggets should try to make a move like trade for Beal or something."
"As someone who thinks that Jamal Murray isn't a good enough second option next to Jokic, the Nuggets losing to a Bucks team sans Jrue Holiday is only throwing more fuel on that fire."
Chris Paul  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  Jaren Jackson Jr  Kristaps Porzingis
"Ah yes I'm sure we'll trade our franchise player  for a bunch of salary filler, to the fucking Clippers who have no draft capital. In a world where an expiring Jrue Holiday yielded 2 frps and 2 swaps, there's just no way Lowry goes to the Clippers. How much are the Clippers paying the guy who wrote this?"
"Yeah even in New Orleans, it's not like people were rabid AD fans. He was their best player, but I would bet that most of the fans out there would have rather had a Jrue Holiday jersey. Maybe that's a crazy hot take though"
"And you don't think Jrue Holiday can do that? And on top of that, in terms of versatility - P.J. Tucker??"
"Ugly game from both teams honestly, Suns looked tired. Book this week has been hounded by Jrue Holiday, Matisse Thybulle and then Marcus Smart. Thankfully he’ll get a rest when playing Brooklyn since they have no one who can guard him lol"
"I’m just gonna say that while they have Simmons and Embiid had good defense as well the bucks have the reigning DPOY and Jrue holiday, not to mention Brook is no slouch of a rim protector."
If its only for defensive stop:  Ben Simmons and its not close  But if its to score also on the other end:  Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday is the most underrated player in the league right now
"Philly is really good, but they remind me a lot of how the Bucks were last year. Dominant player in Embiid/Giannis, but they’re really lacking a great halfcourt creator. I think they need their Jrue Holiday, and it’s sucks because Fultz was supposed to be that guy."
"assuming he extends, they might get a jrue holiday type of haul if a contender gets desperate and the team decides to cut assets in a year or two. randle is extremely tradable"
Yes because 47.6%.win percentage Jrue Holiday is better than 60.1 win % westbrook
"What? Gary Payton is always brought up in discussions of the best defensive players ever. Ask some of these nba players now and former players who played against him and ask if he would be a good defender nowadays. IMO Gary would be Kawhi level of defense in 2021 for a guard size. Look at Jrue Holiday,Cp3, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart and Eric Bledsoe to name a few"
All my takes are aging like fine wine   I said the Suns would be a 4 seed. They’re actually at 2.  I said the Mavs were widely overrated. They are   I said the Hawks would arrive and be a 4 seed. They looked bad at first but now they are ....a 4 seed   I said Jrue holiday isn’t a needle mover. He aint.   I say all that not to hype myself but to point out that all those takes were mostly downvoted. R/nba groupthink doesn’t mean shit. All of our b-ball knowledge is not equal and for the most part ‘popular ‘ takes are just casual fans way to stay safe and not expose themselves
"&gt;passes a much different eye test than Kyrie did  And that's a very valid point and kind of what I was trying to show.    Defensive stats in general are very goofy. Brad Stevens: *""When I get an e-mail that has defensive metrics in it, I delete it.""*   Advanced stats like DRTG really don't show much of anything besides the team is good.   Raw stats like steals/blocks/rebounds don't show enough of the picture to actually declare a player is even good defensively.  * Steph Curry has led the league in steals  * Hassan Whiteside had led the league in blocks  * Andre Drummond has led the league in rebounds  I'm not saying Matisse is bad (he's obviously a very good defender), but DPOY is such a high bar to clear. Jrue Holiday, Marcus Smart and Chris Paul have never even cracked top 5 in votes. As an undersized defender with limited team-wide impact, Matisse has no real chance at DPOY.  Plus DPOY is a term we see thrown about by Philly fans.   * Embiid is a DPOY candidate (although he actually is) * Covington was a DPOY candidate * Simmons is a DPOY candidate * Thybulle will be a DPOY candidate  You can't just label everyone a DPOY candidate."
Only guy who has come close to what Thybulle did on Booker yesterday has been Jrue Holiday.
Havent seen many surprises. Gotta wait till the playoffs  The 76ers are better than I thought they would be. I was right about the Celtics struggling. Took one look at the roster and saw that there was a serious talent deficiency. I knew Jrue Holiday was better than Bledsoe but I didnt think the gap was that large.
"It's not that simple. If his teammates were better, Giannis might have a ring by now. If just Giannis was better, he might also have a ring by now. Giannis is the super-duper-star, it's his responsibility to put his team over the top. So far, he hasn't shown the versatility on offense to carry a team through multiple playoff series. It's too easy to game plan for him.  I still think the Bucks are gonna make the Finals this year, but that's more because of what Jrue Holiday brings to the table."
Did you even watch the game lol that's absolutely not what happened. You think curry drops 40 on jrue holiday but gets clamped by westbrook you trippin
Thybulle is nuts. He might be surpassing Jrue Holiday as the best at guarding Booker
Rudy Gobert  David Thompson  Joe Dumars  Jrue Holiday  DeAndre Ayton (mostly relative to his draft class) or Draymond
"Their offense is fine. Their defense sucks. Adams brings the only identity the Pelicans have with his rebounding threat. Screens and offensive rebounds from the 5 consistently creates more space than 3 point shooting. The team didn't go often Bledsoe, he was a salary match for Jrue Holiday that came with an extra pick.   We're also in the 2nd year of a massive rebuild, immediate success was never expected."
Yeah but Ingram has to take way tougher shots this season despite putting up roughly  the same numbers and efficiency as last season. Think he really misses Jrue Holiday setting him up like last season. A benefit of this change is that he’s been taking waaaay more off the dribble and pull up 3s at a pretty good success rate. If I’m Griff I’m letting the league know everyone is available besides Ingram and Zion. Can’t piss away seasons “developing” players around them. Hoping Beal requests a trade in the summer and we go on hard for him
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
Saying that Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are all-stars is like saying the Lakers had all-stars Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard last year.  By this logic DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin are all-stars for the Nets and they have 5 all-stars.
"&gt; he'll have a cap hit of $38m in 2023/2024  With the cap in '23-'24 being predicted to be around $119.2 million, $38m for a good second guy is really not a problem. He'll still be on the right side of 30. I'd be more worried about guys like Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum, Tobias Harris, Draymond Green, Gordon Hayward, etc. who all have big contracts the same lenght as Siakam's but who are older."
"Well said, man.   With that said, holy shit, Jrue Holiday played the best perimeter defense that I've seen this year. Book had to work his ass off to get the slightest bit of space all night. I don't think fans realize how valuable it is to have a guy that you can pretty much guarantee to come in and clamp the opposing team's best guard/wing/perimeter shooter while also being a versatile offensive presence. Jrue is the fucking man."
It is there. Some people have jobs. Watch him push off that the 3 point line be for dribbling 2 times. It was why jrue ( first all nba d team) holiday wasn't guarding him and pj's elbow grazed him running by
"As much as people wanna blame Stotts.  This is a GM issue.  People have been calling for a CJ Trade for years now. Trent looks like a great young replacement, you trade him for an older similar player.  You know your defensive star bigman has a lengthy recovery. You don't draft, trade for or sign a defensive athletic big.  Management never strikes when it's time. Last year, with Trent on the rise and teams like Philly, Houston New Orleans Milwaukee looking suspect they should've tried to move CJ and a package for another more complimentary player.  CJ, Collins and a ton of picks probably could've got them a Ben Simmons. Or something lesser maybe a Jrue Holiday...idk they never go for anything substantive."

"This but unironically. There’s no world in which Bev deserved All Defense over Jrue Holiday last year, outside of just his team’s record  He’s a *good* defender (not elite), but mainly on ball as a pest. His reputation allows him to foul so much and get away with it/praised for it and he’s not quite as good as Jrue, including last year"
Draymond Green to the trailblazers would be a very interesting fit. I also think that Jrue Holiday to the Mavericks would be a really good fit.
It's honestly a relief to watch Jrue Holiday play such good defense on other great guards in the league. He gives Lillard hell. Shitty ending especially after some crazy good defense.
I was not expecting that from Jrue holy shit.   Can’t wait to see some one post that highlight on here with the title “Jrue Holiday DETONATES on the Suns!!!” Despite it being wildly untrue
Getting one supermax player makes other players want to join them like Lebron and AD. Also Kawhi and paul George. They were trades tho. But AD specifically limited his teams and it was known he wanted to join his idol lebron.  Also paying for a 2nd star keeps the first stsr on the team like bucks acquiring jrue holiday.
"Lol the nets don't play defense, if the bucks play decent on offense unlike last year they already have a chance. Jrue Holiday is one of the best wing defenders on the planet, and Giannis is obviously Giannis in the paint. This is coming from a hawks fan, no bias here. I could easily see a scenario where the nets shoot poorly in the playoffs from three and get swept by the bucks. Plus they are always hurt their big three drives and draws so much contact I would be very surprised if one of them doesn't get injured in the playoffs."
First actual point guard we've had since Jrue Holiday
"“Steph’s about to hit 30 again”    “Rather watch Jrue Holiday drop 15 and 4 with solid defense and a couple spot up threes, please and thank you”"
Jrue Holiday &lt;3
Jrue Holiday or Tobias Harris
"Ignoring Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, the Nets, either Lowry or Siakam, and the fact that Suns, and Jazz aren't considered contenders by anyone."
"They are CLEARLY a worse team than 1-7 in the west. Clearly. You wouldn't take them over any of those teams. They are within \~5 games of every team 8-13, that's MEM, GSW, SAS, NOP, SAC, OKC. Like I said, they prob should have won a couple more games, but they are a fringe playoff team and they belong in that group.      Everything points to that. The best player on the team is 20 years old and hasn't played a full season. The are one of the youngest teams in the league. They are a piss poor 3pt shooting team. They are a piss poor defensive team. They've lost rotation pieces to injury. Last year they were a fringe playoff team, and since then they lost Jrue Holiday, Derrick Favors, and JJ Redick when he was still good."
Jrue Holiday on the Pelicans? I can only imagine..   Can someone photoshop him in a Pels jersey??
"They need to trade Bledsoe, they’ll probably have to attach picks. Maybe target a guy like Jrue Holiday."
Why would they not want to keep Jrue Holiday?
Jrue Holiday
"Considering he’s a starter (more difficult assignments rather than coming off the bench) and lower is better, how is that a bad thing? He has a better defensive rating than Jrue Holiday who people call an elite defender. According to Statmuse (your source) he has the second best DRTG behind DPOY candidate Ben Simmons.  Thanks for proving my point."
They trade Zion to the Bucks for someone like Jrue Holiday
"They honestly have all the pieces to make it happen as Giannis is the best piece the East has at neutralizing Embiid. Jrue Holiday will occupy Ben Simmons, Middleton is another great playoff performer, and both teams have solid benches. I'd take the Bucks in 7 if it wasn't for their coach being notoriously bad in the crunch"
"People also forget how Mozgov missed the game winning lay up at the end of the 4th.  If Mozgov hits that shot, Cavs steal game 1, do NOT have to play an overtime where Kyrie ends up getting hurt, and I think with LeBron playing like he was and Kyrie, the Cavs end up winning.  Every team Golden State played in 2015 had major injuries:  - Jrue Holiday missed the first round for the Pelicans  - Conley missed the second round for the Grizzlies  And then you face off against LeBron, a trash bench and no Love or Kyrie."
"There were also a number of solid players they could have chosen over Hasheem. Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, Patty Mills, Brandon Jennings, and Patrick Beverley to name a few. Hell, even Ricky Rubio would have been a better pick."
That's because Jrue Holiday is the best wing defender of recent years.
I’ve seen footage where star players claim Jrue Holiday is one of if not the best wing defender. He seems like today’s Tony Allen. Might not win a lot of big awards but always gets the job done.
"Anthony Davis is a baby back bitch and is a LeBron nut slurper. You seriously telling me a team of AD, Zion, and Jrue Holiday couldn't be considered a threat for a chip?"
"True story. He'd easily be number one on my Wizards. Sixers will be fun to watch they are really hungry this year.   Seems like the Sixers have a great eye for elite perimeter defenders (Iggy, Covington , Jrue Holiday, Matisse, Simmons, and even Jerami Grant )"
has jrue holiday ever had a 20/20/20 game
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going.

"Maybe when he played with new orlenas. He had Darius Miller, Ian Clark, and nikola mirotic shooting well as options outside of AD, boogie, and jrue holiday"
"That literally mean nothing. We have enough of a sample size of the players careers to know what they are.   We had a nice lil run in 2018 without Embiid. That doens't make a starting lineup of Saric and Amir Johnson at the 4-5 a good team lmao.   Meanwhile AD had Jrue Holiday and Mirotic. Are you really going to argue that Sixers team was better??   It isn't shitting on the Sixers to say Embiid hasn't been playing next to elite level talent. It's reality. That's why we traded away everything for Butler, but that lasted half of a season.   In fact, Embiid has never played next to another 20 PPG scorer, the way AD has."
"And today we see Jrue Holiday, not an all star, completely dominate him"
Mans was definitely playing injured. Jrue holiday had clamps tho
Trae stayed the night at the Jrue Holiday detention center
Trae has missed some of his usual easy buckets but people are underestimating the impact of having Jrue Holiday breathing down you neck on defense
"the team never gave it a name, that was the fans.    And who did the sixers trade away that they should be missing now or then?  Can we name one dude outside of Jrue Holiday who they got a Kings ransom for?  And was needed to start the whole thing?  Hinkie oversaw 2.5 seasons before Jerry Colangelo was injected into the organization so cut your timeline in half bud."
"Lillard got put in a straight jacket by Jrue Holiday in 2018 lmfao, he’s not beating the Cavs in 2016."
"No they didn't. Their tank started when they traded Jrue Holiday. 5 years after that they had 52 wins and the season before that they were trying to win, Embiid just missed over half the season and they got 28 wins. And they didn't really rest players like teams have been doing, they traded them away."
"&gt; he did it on horrid splits the first time against the warriors  In the 2015 First Round, AD put up 32/11 on 54 eFG%, 61 TS% against the Warriors, with an injured Jrue Holiday. I'm not what you mean by horrid splits lol."
"see, you get it. CJ is a great player, but someone like Jrue Holiday or Tobias Harris might fit better because they're less ball dominant and a better defender."
Jrue Holiday and Jared Dudley
"who did the sixers trade away that they should have missed either then or now?  Jrue Holiday is the best player they traded away and that was needed to kick things off, everyone else was average to below average.  People always say this but lets hear some names.  It comes off incredibly insincere when people bemoan moving guys like Thad Young, Evan Turner, and Spencer Hawes.  Hinkie also very very rarely spoke to the media at all, Morey is on record saying he probably could have saved his job if he did.  Hinkie is on record saying he didnt control the narrative surrounding the tank.  This sounds exactly like the opposite of what you are saying."
So is his teammate Jrue Holiday.  Bucks have locked in on those 2. It will be hard for them to put anything else around Giannis.
"i'm saying players that are seen as worse than Ben in the RS you'd rather have in the playoffs over him   like Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Fred, Jaylen"
Bucks were one OT away from going up 3-0 on the raps  And that Sixers team is had Butler who they lost  While the Bucks added Jrue Holiday
"His screen setting ability has nothing to do with his bulk. Hes not a good screener cause he can wall off a dude like Capela or Steven Adams, he's a good screener cause the guy guarding him his so focused on staying attached to him that they completely forget to switch. Look at the play from the end of the last Dubs-Bucks game where Wiggins gets a free drive and dunk in the final minute. Jrue Holiday was on Steph allllllll game long and on this play Steph just momentarily blocks Middleton from the play and Jrue doesn't even think to switch. That's where his ability comes from and tbh nobody else in the league exploits that specific situation as well as he does."
Jrue Holiday
"What is ""very rarely""? and when does it become not rare enough for you that it becomes serious? Tatum, Jrue Holiday, and Tristan Thompson have all stated that they have felt long lasting effects of COVID. As of Jan 21, 2021, little over 100 players have tested positive in the NBA, adding on the time from then to now, and the 3 month break when they weren't tested, let's very liberally suggest 200 NBA players have tested positive. That would still be a 1.5% of the most fit people on the planet who experienced quality-of-life altering symptoms (at least in the short to medium term). And that's just the players who have come out and stated their battle with the virus. To put this in perspective, the AZ vaccine has caused blood clots in 0.0004% of patients, that is orders of magnitudes lower than the aforementioned 1.5%, and the vaccine was suspended (at least in canada and denmark to my knowledge).  More importantly, ""just don't be fat"" is such a immature and elitist view (I walk around 145 so don't worry about me). Even if you have taken tremendous care in your body and health. Just dropping 50-100 pounds is incredibly difficult and takes a long time to a accomplish responsibly, and the long term impact of years of obesity doesn't just disappear the second you hit the ""normal"" BMI mark."
Jrue Holiday
"You nephew's act like god damned Scottie Pippen was  Anthony Davis when he's really Jrue Holiday.  Is Jrue Holiday good? Sure, but he ain't Anthony Davis. You saw which one Bron got to force their way off their team. Anthon Davis, is fucking Shaq. Kyrie is AI. Dwade is Dream. If Shaq went to Chicago in 96' Theyd of won 10 straight. If MJ left Chicago in 99' because he just always wanted to win one for his hometown of Philadelphia that just so happened to also have AI,  theyd of won 10 straight. Ain't no one calling Jrue Holiday a league wrecking pick up. No offense Jrue, but you ain't that and neither was Scottie."
"Jrue holiday, khris middleton, giannis antetokounmpo 😏"
Only 10m less than jrue holiday money
They also got him for an absurdly cheap price. That deal will go down as as bad a return any superstar has ever gotten in return it’s embarrassing. 1 extra first and pick swap more than what Jrue holiday who had less time left on his deal at the time of trade fetched back
"I know I’m late to this, and I do agree with you that Myles is still a ways off of Rudy Gobert, but man you’re selling Myles extremely short trying to put him as just a shot blocker, but your post seems to be based on eye test alone.  There are nights when I myself get frustrated watching Myles and how he gets bullied by stronger bigs.  But every time you look at the stats Myles is damn near top 3 in every major defensive metric.  I’m not just talking RAPTOR/advanced analytics, but things like opponent fg% at the rim, on/off team defensive rating, etc. There was even a post in this sub just the other day showing that Myles is statistically the best pick n roll defending big in the league.  He is absolutely a defender on the same level as Simmons, Capela and Holiday, and is statistically a top 3 defender in the league this year.  Saying he makes no sense for DPOY and then saying guys like Jrue, Capela and Simmons do is just crazy talk.  My vote still goes to Rudy, but I think you’re underselling what Turner brings to the table here."
"Lu Dort, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday in any order and then I have no idea."
https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/.amp/news/paul-george-says-jrue-holiday-toughest-defender
"If his improvements in the PNR and 3pt shooting last offseason is any sign, I can see him working on his inside game this off season. Jrue Holiday is obviously too much but he’s an inside game away from being a really valuable PG"
"He’s going to be one of those players that every team wants, I see him turning into a Jrue Holiday type player. Hope he stays with Zion though, just need to get rid of Eric Bledsoe."
"We have PJ Tucker, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton,Jrue holiday   Also donte is a good defender, nobody will “stop” Harden,KD,or Kyrie but the bucks have the best personnel to slow them down"
And that’s why we have Jrue Holiday
"Bucks shot really well.   Claxton and Brown need more mins.   KD, Kyrie and Giannis did their thing.   Jrue Holiday had a night.   It'll be interesting to see how Harden affects the dynamics and matchups.    Refs let a lot more contact go than a normal Tuesday night game or regular season in general. Brooklyn will have to find some functional way to guard Giannis and not sacrifice scoring on the other end.    DiVincenzo gave a lot of effort on D and extended plays through just plain effort. I think Bruce Brown brings that but Nash would need to play him more."
"Nets fans are so spoiled, 3 top 10 players on one squad is just ridiculous. I can’t wait to spoil their playoff run. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are gonna have to be absolute dogs this Playoff run on defense. Portis also has a couple games to get back in rhythm"
Jrue FUCKING Holiday
"Jrue ""Clamps"" Holiday"
INJECT 4Q KHA$H INTO MY VEINS  Also Jrue Holiday clutch cookies
"Ignore the box score, Jrue Holiday won this game"
Jrue Holiday.
damn that dude Jrue Holiday is NICE.. it's too bad he had zero talent on his team in new orleans
"I really, really think that Jrue Holiday is a top 30 NBA player."
Jrue Holiday.  That's it. That's the comment.
"&gt;Simmons ability to switch 1-5 may make him “overrated”  I think people just think more versatile means better sometimes so he gets a little more credit than he should. He's good at defending a lot of players, but there are better one on one wing defenders than him.  Like imo I'd rather see Ben Simmons defending someone on my team than Jrue Holiday"
"Hey AD,   How was it like playing with Jrue Holiday? How’d you like him as a teammate on and off the the floor during your time at NOLA?   Thanks."
"Hi AD, you have played with both elite defenders: Jrue Holiday and Alex Caruso. What are the pros of playing with each and how did/do they fit in your playstyle?"
"Defensive RTG in the context of a team is good, but if you use it on an individual player it can get real sketch. Like for example, Kyle Kuzma over his 4 year career so far has had his DRTG be tied with or better than Jrue Holiday each year. It's really hard to have an accurate one number defensive stat for individuals."
Trae is only a little bit better than Jrue Holiday on offense?   Lol.
Jrue Holiday is a million times better at defense and Trae is only a little better on offense
Finally Jrue Holiday got some damn respect.  I don’t think people still don’t understand how good he truly is on offence as a scorer specifically.   There’s a reason almost every elite player in the league has talked about how good he is on both sides of the floor and especially offence. He is there toughest matchup after all.
"I knew the Ringer would snub Trae before I even opened it. I mean, Jrue Holiday, really?"
You take Jrue Holiday over Jaylen?
"How is Jrue Holiday on this list when Russ isn't? I mean yes all the statheads (including the Ringer) have shat on him for years, but he's having a monstrous season at age 32, and hell, the Wizards are better for it.   Besides that it just felt weird seing Julius Randle on a list like this lol"
Chris Paul  Jrue Holiday  Anthony Davis  Zion Williamson  Peja Stojakovic
"we've needed a combo guard/wing since jrue holiday.  We had Butler for like 20 games and were like ""nah gimme horford""  the best player of that archetype embiid has played with is likely shake milton who is average at best and a blackhole on offense so hes not making anyones life easier by passing."
Jrue Holiday
"To be fair you now have a closing 5 with PJ Tucker, Jrue Holiday, Middleton, and Brolo. Getting Bledsoe out of your closing 5 does a lot for the unit’s overall BBIQ"
&gt; Holiday is a great defender and Jrue is a great shooter  Did he split into two different people?
"I don't think it's exactly the same. Giannis has some serious talent on his team. Holiday is a great defender and Jrue is a great shooter. And his team as a whole as good BBIQ, unlike Lebron's Cavs."
"Then accept the answers you get - Bledsoe sucks ass homie just because he won an award last year doesn’t automatically mean he’ll be beneficial on D this year. And the truth is his Defense award last year and a ton of guard defense awards are bullshit as proven by player interviews, there is no reason Pat Bev or Bledsoe should have gotten defensive team over Jrue Holiday last year."
Jrue Holiday
"You guys need to get your story straight about Randle. Either he was ready before and the Knicks made him the player he is, or he was always this amazing player.  Fun fact - it was the former.  Jrue Holiday was decent but certainly not as good as CJ McCollum"
If Jrue Holiday is enough to put them over the hump like they believe it will then no
Jrue Holiday is really a good defender
Jrue Holiday was worth it and more
Davis had what ?  A jrue holiday in post season??   Westbrook was getting stat padded triple doubles all seasons with KD harden PG cant make any noise in the playoffs lmaooooo all MVP candidates
"Chris Paul didn't really fit the timeline for OKC though.    Jrue Holiday, MCW, Nerlens Noel, Jeremi Grant were all young players while traded for future assets.   For OKC to do something similar, they need to trade SGA, Dort, Poku, Bazley, Maledon, etc for future picks."
"uhm you are viewing this from the wrong perspective, only 47% of his potential assists actually lead to assists which is a pretty low number so his teammates just dont convert his passes  and why are you talking about passes received? he has 48 passes per game which is more then Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, Jrue Holiday ..."
They lost their best defender in Jrue Holiday. Their defense is bad.
"I get the point you’re trying to make but CP3, Conley, Tobias, Jrue Holiday, Aaron Gordon were all added via trade to these teams and Randle was added via FA. They’re all a mixture of both homegrown talent who added pieces vis trade/FA to make them contenders"
"&gt;He traded a 22 year old Jrue Holiday who had just made the All Star team.   &gt;   &gt;He traded a rookie of the year Michael Carter-Williams.  Both of those were good trades. Jrue  hasn't made the all-star team since and MCW fell off a cliff. If Presti thought that he could trade Lu and Shai for more than they were going to be worth in the next 5 years, he'd do those trades in a heart beat."
"I mean, Jrue Holiday for Saric + Noel isn’t exactly good value lol. By trading him your team sucked more, but by that logic any trade is a win for a team if it makes them worse and they improve their draft position."
"Every move he made was the correct decision.  &gt;intentionally drafted seriously injured players  Draft Embiid ✅  &gt;traded a 22 year old Jrue Holiday  For Nerlens Noel, and a pick that became Saric, who was part of the trade for Butler ✅  &gt;traded a rookie of the year MCW  Traded him at his absolutely highest value, received what was technically the Mikal Bridges pick. ✅"
Hinkie intentionally drafted multiple seriously injured players who would not be able to play for at least a season so that he could continue the tank.  He traded a 22 year old Jrue Holiday who had just made the All Star team.  He traded a rookie of the year Michael Carter-Williams.  This would be like Presti trading Shai and Dort at the deadline.
"It's a great idea to bring up, but your criteria are too loose.  &gt; Average defender: this one is tougher to define because defense stats can be often misleading, so I'm gonna go by eye test and my general opinion while trying to be as unbiased as possible  Don't ever go by ""eye test"".  Just use Defensive RAPTOR from 538.  For my list I'll only include players with at least +1.0 rating (top 100 defensive players this year) with 500 minutes or more.  &gt; Above Average 3pt shooter: the player must be above ~35% 3pt% for the 2021 season, and attempt at least 3 3s a game on average  At least three 3s a game is good, but 35% is too low.  We're not looking for average shooters, we want good ones.  I'll use 37%.  These guys fit that criteria this year (in order of Def RAPTOR rating):  1. embiid 1. batum 1. crowder 1. christian wood 1. Gay 1. covington 1. melton 1. anunoby 1. p George 1. connaughton 1. muscala 1. randle 1. kleber 1. Green 1. jrue holiday 1. Leonard 1. royce o'neale 1. Finney-Smith 1. Korkmaz 1. Niang 1. Mikal Bridges  Considering that 5 of these players are making over $20 mil a year, it's hard to classify them as 3 and D players people would be talking of filling their roster to complete it, but theres still good names there.  Randle is the only questionable one on the list because this is the first year hes been good defensively and/or had a decent 3pt%.  But if he can turn around one, why not the other?  Christian wood is also someone people might scoff at, but this is his 2nd year in a row of a good defensive RAPTOR season and makes him 2 for 2 when he gets non-garbage minutes.  Additionally, here's a list of players who just missed the 3pt requirements (either in % or attempts):  1. campazzo (36.9%) 1. cam johnson (36%) 1. neto (2.6 attempts) 1. bazemore (2.5 attempts) 1. vanvleet (36.7%)  You're obviously still right there aren't many, but considering most people are thinking of a swingman (SG, SF, PF) for a 3nD player, it looks more like around 15 players (including those from the ""almosts"") aren't making tons of money and could be considered a swingman.  And the list would only get smaller if we limit to players with consistently good defensive seasons or 3pt numbers."
Jrue Holiday got three picks.   If you’re not offering WAAAAY more than that you don’t actually want him.
"The last three times Jrue Holiday faced Kyrie, he is averaging 35.  And that doesn’t matter. When they played them earlier this season Khris was still on him. Bud loves to use Giannis as strictly help and there’s nothing to suggest that’ll change.  And the end of the day, it truly doesn’t matter. Come playoff time, they’ll just matchup hint and iso Lopez or Divencezo every play if they have to."
"&gt;It does not matter. KD and Kyrie will treat any one on one defender the same. I don’t get why people can’t understand this yet.  &gt;They have too many weapons to be throwing doubles around willy nilly all while having arguably the three best iso scorers in the game.   Nope. Jrue Holiday is arguably the best one on one defender in the league. Massive difference between him and say...Kemba Walker.  &gt;And also, Giannis doesn’t guard KD. That’s usually Khris Middleton.  Not this season. KD plays the 4 now. Giannis has and will guard him."
Jrue Holiday and Giannis will defend much better than Kyrie and KD.

"We're on r/nba, you know there are people who will make that claim seriously.   Also, I was curious myself where Rubio would end up.   By the way, I missed on that list:  * Doncic * Trae Young * Isaiah Thomas * Goran Dragic - 50 * Jrue Holiday * De'Aaron Fox * Lowry * Mugsy Bogues * Avery Johnson * Jason Terry * Calderon * Tinsley * Ty Lawson * Bledsoe - 60 * Rafer Alston  So I think Rubio might actually be top 100 all time, even top 70 all time.  He was a starter in the NBA for 10 years, and he might have gotten a better reputation had he played on some good teams."
"I think y'all will be better this year, I'm hopeful. Playoff rotations shrink and 9th, 10th, 11th men don't get meaningful minutes. Your standard lineup of Holiday, DiVicenzo, Middleton, Giannis, and Lopez is totally solid defensively and if you need to go small you can swap PJ Tucker for Lopez and drop Giannis to the 5. The biggest problem the last two years in my opinion is that Bledsoe couldn't locate the rim. Jrue is so much better of a player I really think it'll be noticeably different this year."

"I don't mean this in any way negatively, like live your life and make that bag young fella...  But can you imagine what this guy could be in 5-10 years if he loved the game on that obsessive type of level?  I think it was on duncan robinsons podcast (it might have been JJs) where jrue holiday brought up how fans sometimes don't realize that the NBA is just like any job.  There are folks who devote their lives to the shit and are considered average, all-stars who just show up and go home like any other job, and then you have guys like Dame who are straight up obsessive over the game and have all the skill in the world."

"Ehhhh, hold your horses there. There was tons of picks and switching going on in that game. Like if you watched the first half you’d know Jrue Holiday was mostly on Christian Wood and in the 2nd half KPJ had lots of switches on him."
On jrue holiday
the Cavs really gave this man's locker away then gave him away LMAO  real shit tho he's the youngest player in nba history to drop 50/10  he did it on Jrue Holiday and the bucks
And he did it against Jrue Holiday
On Jrue holiday too sheesh
"Dropped a 50 piece on Jrue Holiday lol, he's special."
did a lot of that on Jrue Holiday too. man that was special
WHILE GUARDED BY JRUE MFCUKING HOLIDAY BABY
I am incredibly grateful for Jrue Holiday
I guess Jrue Holiday and prime Boogie don’t exist
"I started watching games again a couple of weeks ago, for the first time since 2012. The Bucks and 76ers have impressed me the most so far, but the teams that I have found most fun to watch have been Hornets, Heat, Clippers, Suns and Celtics. I'm also excited about seeing the Hawks with Trae Young when he gets back. The players who have impressed/surprised me the most so far are Jrue Holiday, Miles Bridges, Maxey, Rondo and Kemba Walker. I kinda want to pick a team as well, but I don't think I can tbh"
"You are really ignoring how much more pressure it is to win now.  Yes he took 3 less shots a game, but he had to completely change his shot profile and play style to accommodate for another player. While on top of that also make sure that they won games instead of focusing on progressing/getting used to the league.  Think of how much pressure is on Anthony Edwards right now compared to a guy like Jrue Holiday."
"Anthony Davis is a unicorn and very clearly a superstar, i am so sick of seeing these piss poor AD takes. I watched my team get absolutely sodomized by AD and Jrue Holiday in the playoffs a few years ago, and it’s because AD is a force of nature and can asset his will almost anywhere on the court. Him playing with LeBron has made people forget how good AD is.   Also the omission of dame on your superstar list is extremely interesting. if you started watching basketball this year, then maybe this omission and your terrible take on anthony davis makes sense."
"Eric Gordon and Jrue Holiday were/are key players for some of the best teams in the league? The other names are obviously not great, but those two are good."
"When did AD have a good supporting cast lol. In 2015 he carried a lineup of tyreke evans, eric gordon, jrue holiday, quincy poindexter, and omer asik to 45 wins in the West. His supporting cast every other year aside from 2018 has been mediocre to terrible."
Is Jrue Holiday supposed to be some top caliber star player lmao. He made one all-star game in his career in 2013 on the east. He was never a star caliber player in the west.
"&gt; Cousins and Holiday were incredible   Did you even watch that team? Cousins didn’t play in the playoffs, The Pels played better with Mirotic than they did with Boogie lol   Rondo was great. Mirotic/Moore were very good. The Jrue-AD blitz was incredibly effective against Lillard. It’s still not crazy to say AD carried that team in the playoffs though. 30-13-2 with 4 stocks on good efficiency is absurd lol"
Pat Bev is going to turn around a gentleman's sweep didn't ya know ? Lol.  Jrue Holiday isn't going to stop a sweep and Grizzlies players still played and Conley played BETTER after his face injury.   Weren't the Heat injured last year ? Do you mention that to discredit Bron ? Didn't think so.
Constantly injured Jrue Holiday? And who else?  You’re exposing yourself rn.
Jrue Holiday averaged 28-7-4 versus Portland that year in the playoffs. They also had prime Boogie throughout the regular season. AD went off in that series they won but that roster was way better than what Golden State has outside Curry.
"Correct, because they started with Paul George, Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul and were able to trade all of them for a ton of capital. There's no way Jrue Holiday or Evan Turner were getting even half as much in a trade as the Thunder's players. Hinkie had to work with what he had and did a phenomenal job turning a mediocre roster into a ton of assets that the following regime largely squandered.  Presti started with a roster of top end talent, saw that the team he built was good but not good enough to win a title, and sold high on all of his players (much like Hinkie) to rebuild the team through the draft.  Hinkie had to be much worse to ensure they'd be at the top of the draft since we had our own first rounders. Presti had top end players that he could trade to get other team's first rounders as well as a young future all star/potential all NBA player in SGA."
You got downvoted because Jrue Holiday has been called a top defensive guard for like 10 years with no debate about it.
"it's not totally absurd. someone like jrue holiday is close to simmons in defensive play, prob a top 10/top 5 defender, but isn't really put in the top 25. Same with myles turner."
Jrue Holiday. His defensive impact is underrated.
And every player whose playing really good basketball is an MVP Candidate as well.  Nobody:  r/nba: Why are we sleeping on Jrue Holiday for MVP?

"Thunder also had russ, steven adams, and PG13 to trade for picks, the sixers had jrue holiday, evan turner, and spencer hawes"
"the officials only enforce those rules with some players though. They do away with the landing space rules on curry, but harden lands on the defender and he's at the line. Touch embiid anywhere and the refs trip all over themselves trying to congratulate him for his effort, but you can hand check jokic all day and its whatever. Jrue holiday and pat bev could pimp smack a player and get called ""gritty defenders"" but guys like rubio and fox would foul out in the first quarter doing the exact same thing."
jrue randall holiday
"That’s true, bucks don’t switch often but what you’re saying is true, holiday becomes more valuable than Brook in a switching scheme. I have to disagree on the 1a, 1b thing. I think Giannis is a way better and more valuable defender than Holiday. Giannis is almost a guaranteed top ten defense by himself like Harden for offense. Jrue just can’t replicate that no matter who he locks down"
A bit more than Jrue Holiday
Didn’t jrue holiday give his entire bubble paycheck away?
I mean look at Jrue Holiday and how much players respect his defensive game. Hella Tony Allen too!
"I feel like Dort’s reputation is a bit inflated because of the rockets series. Yes he’s very good, but give me Jrue holiday over Dort defensively. Also you can definitely argue Jimmy over OG."
Man no mention about my boy Jrue Holiday what is this slander.
I think Jrue Holiday said that in JJ Reddick podcast
"I love Dort, but I feel like Jrue Holiday should still get that spot imo."
What exactly do you think his athleticism is weak? He’s quick of the dribble and has zero issues breaking ankles.  He has put Jrue Holiday on his ass a few times.  He once had Jrue behind him facing the wrong damn way.  The level of athleticism needed to do that is pretty damn high.  He can back down almost anyone in the post.  There aren’t a lot of guys his size that are stronger.  He’s not swole and cut.  His endurance isn’t the best.  Maybe that’s what you are thinking?
"Iguodala was the best player on playoff teams, Rajon Rondo never was.  Guys like Iguodala or Ben Wallace will forever be underrated though, people say they care about defense but don't actually otherwise Jrue Holiday would be considered one of the best PGs in the league right now."
"Trust me, people will find ways to shit on players even if they’re objectively likable. Jrue Holiday is a great guy just like Jaylen, and he got flack for donating to black owned businesses (not joking)."
Jrue Holiday was the 2nd best player
"I am yoking  Jrue Holiday was the poster child answer for this for years, only Mike Conley is the bigger example of this, the most overrated underrated player in NBA history when he was in Memphis"
3 or 4 months ago I might've agreed but at this point everyone is gushing about how good Jrue Holiday is and how important he was to both the Bucks and team USA. He's not underrated anymore.
JRUE HOLIDAY
Yeah I swear one time he literally passed it to Holiday and Jrue then got a wide open easy dunk in the 4th.
Jrue Holiday is a pretty good one on one defender. Just saying.
Yep sure have. An incredible need for a defensive presence outside of Jrue Holiday.
Lauren Holiday is better at soccer than Jrue Holiday is at basketball. Jrue would agree
JRUE HOLIDAY AND KHRIS MIDDLETON ARE GOLD MEDALISTS AND NBA CHAMPIONS IN THE SAME YEAR. HELL YEAHHHHH!
Jrue Holiday.
The only difference between this gold and the 7th place in 2019 is KD and Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday joins wife Lauren as a gold medalist couple while Javale McGee joins mom Pam (1984 WBB) as mother/son gold medalists
1) KD  2) Jayson Tatum  3) Jrue Holiday  4) Everyone else...
God Bless Kevin Durant and Jrue Holiday. Enjoy vacation.
"Jrue Holiday DESTROYED us, yeah KD scored 29 but Jrue was everywhere, he ate us alive, ggs US"
Jrue Holiday is having a pretty good year. I just got a piece of popcorn that was stuck in my teeth since the 1st quarter so I think I know how he feels.
Durant was amazing. But jrue holiday coming straight from the finals straight to the olympics and performing on both ends was the difference for team USA. Especially compared to booker and Middleton
"I want everyone except Jrue Holiday, Jayson Tatum and Draymond to give KD their medals"
Jrue Holiday is an American hero.
Imagine winning the NBA championship and then an Olympic gold medal less than 3 weeks later. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton must be on top of the world right now
Jrue Holiday is the true winner of the 2021 season.
"Jrue Holiday, American hero."
Durant was amazing. But jrue holiday coming straight from the finals straight to the olympics and performing on both ends was the difference for team USA. Especially compared to booker and Middleton
THE SUMMER OF JRUE HOLIDAY
"Inconsistent offense be damned, Jrue Holiday has been defense incarnate these past playoffs and Olympics. My man.  ...Except for that terrible pass when there were just ten seconds left. What the heck was that, Jrue?"
"As much as I've watched Jrue Holiday, his defensive ability still amazes me every day"
JRUE HOLIDAY AMERICAN HERO.
if not be jrue holiday frence would be winning
Jrue Holiday has got to be USA’s 2nd most important player right? Dude does it all
"Huge fan of Jrue holiday, his defense gives me a little PTSD but he’s just so good"
"Jrue "" I've put clamps on Booker, Chris Paul, Butler, whatsoever "" Holiday I don't give af bout Fournier"
THANK YOU DAME AND JRUE HOLIDAY
Looks like Jrue Holiday still cant make an easy lay up
why is jrue holiday attempting all these impossible shots.
What fuel is Jrue holiday running on man !!
Jrue Holiday has been an absolute force. Imagine the havoc he would wreck if the NBA relaxed its fouling rules
Jrue Holiday is a DAWG!
Jrue Holiday is a menace. Lol
Jrue Holiday!!!
I love watching Jrue Holiday play
jrue holiday is NUTTY on defense
"Jrue Holiday is the best defensive guard in the league and it ain't even close, how does he dominate every game"
Jrue fucking holiday is a difference maker!
It’s nice to not be playing against Jrue Holiday
That’s our boy JRUE Holiday
So are they going to hand out a Larry Obrien trophy to team usa? Pretty cool for a guy like Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday has played some amazing defense.
Jrue Holiday could beat Booker one v one.
Jrue holiday is so strong. Big boi tings
"Holiday such a fucking dog, PnR don’t mean shit when Jrue is on your ass the whole floor and Gobert can’t get him off. Jrue MVP of this team besides KD."
jrue holiday is such a nice defender. speaks to how good booker was during the finals
Jrue Holiday would be elite in a FIBA league
YEAH JRUE HOLIDAY THATS HOW YOU DO IT
The one on gobert he didn’t get fouled in the first place. The shot clock was weird but I chalked that up to a weird fiba rule. De colo clearly pushed off. That Fournier “foul” would have the entire French team fouled out.  Jrue holiday has 2 fouls on absolutely nothing. Tatum blocked Rudy cleanly and they called a foul. KD got clotheslined with no call and then 7 seconds later we got a foul call for 0 contact
Never thought Jrue holiday will outplay Lillard at the PG
Gobert is getting clamped by Jrue holiday 😂
It's a god damn pleasure to watch Jrue Holiday
THAT'S NBA CHAMPION JRUE HOLIDAY
Thanks God USA has the best player in the world: Jrue Holiday
You did not just say we lack star power with Trae young on our team averaging 29-11 in the playoffs against 3 top 5 defenses 😂 and dropping 48-11 against jrue holiday one of the best defenders in the league. I can’t accept someone actually believes that.
"FIBA rules and officiating + Patrick Beverly or Jrue Holiday guarding you, he ain’t shooting 7/10. More like complaining 7 out of 10 plays there wasn’t a call"
"His fucking teammate jrue holiday, Draymond, gobert, Simmons, davis, Butler.  He's amazing athletically man on offense and defense but he can still grow that's not a bad thing."
Once again. Jrue Holiday requested a trade. All of this is just Bill being the league clown again
"But Milwaukee got ripped off right?  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherdodson/2020/11/17/new-orleans-pelicans-get-ransom-from-milwaukee-bucks-trade-jrue-holiday-before-2020-nba-draft/?sh=54a6285042a4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherdodson/2020/11/17/new-orleans-pelicans-get-ransom-from-milwaukee-bucks-trade-jrue-holiday-before-2020-nba-draft/?sh=54a6285042a4)  This megadeal vaulted New Orleans deep into the playoffs, right?  How did it work out for The Bucks?"
Jrue holiday but can't play defense
Jrue Holiday is a Kyle Lowry type of player🤔
Jrue Holiday was leaving he was an expiring contract
"&gt;needs Middleton   Yes  &gt;needs jrue  Fuck no, jrue holiday shot below 40% in 2 series, the nets and the suns series. The only reason why the bucks win those series was because Giannis was so fucking dominant, especially in the finals where he averaged 37ppg after the team was 0-2."
"&gt; Simmons: ""How about keep Jrue Holiday and grab Myles turner a year ago and call it a day. That would've been nice.""  You're posting an idiot take and then asking people to take it seriously? LMAO yourself."
"&gt; Woz: ""I think the first one is, the Jrue thing... there's context here. The contract is coming up, they didn't want to pay him all the money the bucks would pay him when they thought the time line with zion was one thing, right?"" [...] That's how you see the whole, 'Alright, we're willing to pay 90 million for Kyle Lowry,' which was the market rate for the guy, but not give Jrue Holiday his 130 million dollar contract to be better and younger.  .  &gt; Simmons: ""How about keep Jrue Holiday and grab Myles turner a year ago and call it a day. That would've been nice.""  They're certainly not talking like people who understand that Jrue requested a trade."
"That Jrue deal was pretty damn great.   Thos guy is acting like Jrue Holiday changes Zions fortunes. Last I checked, AD had Jrue.and they were mediocre.  Also, this notion that Jrue is unquestionably better than Lowry is very suspect.  I am no Griffin fan, but I think the Holiday deal made great sense. Its letting Ball go, then trading a pick for Graham that is weird to me."
"I dont think the return they got for Jrue Holiday is their issue at all. That said the limited minutes [we got of Jrue/Ingram/Zion](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612740&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201950,1627742,1629627) were fire but trading Jrue is not where there issues lie."
"Pelicans got a good number of assets for Holiday. The team is building for the future, so I don’t think what Griffin did here is too unreasonable. Plus wasn’t the team bad with Jrue on the roster?"
"Or if Jrue Holiday could hit an open three, or if Middleton didn’t alternate between prime MJ and a G Leaguer, or if Jeff Green only had a good shooting night in game 5 instead of by far the best of his career…  Ifs and buts are all fine but Giannis just capped off an all-timer of a playoff run with a GOAT-tier finals series, it doesn’t matter how he’s perceived. I’m sure he’d be getting shit on if we lost, in fact I’m certain because he *was* getting shit on while that series was ongoing, but the people shitting on him would be wrong because he was fantastic and he didn’t lose anyway. We’ve seen what he can do, and it’s something very few other players in history have been capable of."
If they won jrue holiday isn’t on the bucks and they don’t win this year
"Given its arguable who is even better in the first place, saying considerably is just funny. Did people really forget Randle just carried a team from the worst projected record in the league to the 4 seed and finished all nba 2nd team? I truly believe if you switch Jrue holiday and Julius Randle for the Knicks we don’t come close to where we did. You put Julius Randle as third option on the bucks and I wouldn’t be shocked at all to still see them win"
basically Jrue Holiday in the finals
"Jrue Holiday and it’s not even close, only semi-ironically"
"It’s not that the pick was bad, it’s that yall traded Jrue holiday for him and saric"
He’s a steal. Got Jrue Holiday written all over him.
"Jrue holiday 1 ring, rankle 0 ring. Checkmate athiests."
nah i think hes just pointing out that guys like luka or Goran are sneaky athletic and overall the type of guy you want your daughter to marry. But Lillard or Jrue Holiday or KD are the types of guys you might want to keep tabs on when they're in your corner store in case they steal something.  There's nothing racist about that. its just good old fashioned Basketball
"&gt;If Schroeder had a more solid and consistent 3 ball  He'd make at least $25M a season, probably more.  Check the list of veteran players who averaged more assists than Schroder last year.  The only two who made less than Schroder were TJ McConnell and Ricky Rubio. Rubio is one of the worst shooters in the league, and doesn't defend. McConnell is a 7ppg player.    The rest of that 6+ assist club? Westbrook, Young, Paul, Doncic, Draymond Green, Jokic, Lillard, Morant, Fox, Butler, DeRozen, Simmons, Sabonis, VanVleet, LaMelo Ball, Garland, Jrue Holiday, Conley, Irving, Randle, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brogdon, and Stephen Curry.  Not many cheap players on that list.  Playmaking is one of the rarest and most-valuable skills in basketball."
This probably drives me more insane than anything. Someone earlier told me that Jrue Holiday is *considerably* better than Julius Randle
"Can we consider Ben Simmons a PG?   Because if so  PG - Chris Paul    SG - Damian Lillard    SF -  Steph Curry    PF - Jrue Holiday    C - Ben Simmons      Could sub Dame for Kyrie honestly, I know people will drag me for having Jrue Holiday and Simmons over (INSERT ANY STAR CALIBER PG HERE) but with a backcourt and SF position who are all mediocre at best on defense, you’re going to need some size in the front court."
"Portland’s never attached stars, it’s one of the smaller markets.  But since 2015 Jimmy Buckets has been traded 3 times, Russy 4 times, CP3 3 times, Wiggins, Jrue Holiday, Boogie Twice, Pauly Gold twice, and too many other players better then anything Portland has drafted or signed. Good GM’s make good moves, Neil should not be let off the hook for doing a shitty job the last 7 years. Anyone of those players could rise Portland’s ceiling by a round or two. Dame is good, but not elite. He needs help and his GM has failed to even try yer see year."
"It’s like this. If a team is sending out a package of picks similar to what Brooklyn did for Harden, plus talent on top of it, then that team either (1) has to be on the cusp of title contention and think Simmons will help push them over the top; or (2) a team trying to build around Simmons over the next 6 to 8 years. There are probably more teams that fit the second profile than the first. But if it’s known that Simmons is bolting in four years (or more likely, will begging grousing and maybe pulling a Harden with multiple years left on the deal), then no one in that second group is trading one of the hauls like we saw for PG, Jrue Holiday or James Harden. It’s basically dictating the organizations that would be able and willing to trade for Simmons in those circumstances."
Those as well.  And Kanter of course.  Dame still gets a ton of hate for it too.  It's literally why people want CJ out because you can only have 1 bad defensive guard.  If Dame had Jrue Holiday defense then CJ would actually be a viable fit next to him.
"You wanna find out what would happen if Luka had Jrue holiday, Khris Middleton and brook Lopez on his team?"
One time Jrue Holiday and Rajon Rondo won the chip for me in my first season. I didn't even get a chance to rebuild! I think this was 2k17 and my 3rd best player was Jahil Okafor or something lmao
"Right but if you’re saying you’re glad you’re team passed on a generational basketball player for a good but clearly inferior player on the basis of attitude, I’m curious if you keep the same energy with Paul. Would you rather have, like, Jrue Holiday than Paul because he seems like a great guy?"
Jrue Holiday after stepping off the plane has been the USA's 2nd best player.  Robin to KD's Batman.  This man isn't going to let his wife lord her medals over him no mo!
"Man, Jrue Holiday is really the key to this team besides KD, huh?"
"It's not just him. Irving and Westbrook are also very similar in that regard. They are amazing scorers but not that impressive point guards or players in general. To me it's Curry, Paul, prime Tony Parker, Deron Williams during his prime and now Jrue Holiday the ones that represent the elite point guard and a complete player but NBA loves marketing sexy looking numbers and stats therefore a lot of people have a skewed view of who is elite and who isn't"
Giannis plays with Jrue holiday at the point of attack. Gobert is a better defender and it isn't close.
"Completely outclassed by Holiday who is much better playmaker and defender. Everyone can score on this team, sometimes you need other things to have that you can offer. Not having ball 99% in their hands and playing alongside KD isn't a problem for other guards like Jrue, Book, Lavine who are useful enough to adapt but for some reason it's not the case for Dame."
Jrue Holiday is not “considerably” better lmao
"Simmons would be a malcontent on Sacramento or Portland. He's poisoned the small markets against him. He's not a ""missing piece"" for anyone likw Jrue Holiday was (except maybe the Wolves), so the cost can't cripple them in the future when he bounces to LA at the end of his contract."
"Yes, he can lockdown guards. Obviously he is no jrue holiday or Lue dort but whenever he is locked in defensively the guy is great."
Suns need more high-end power less depth. See Bucks pre Jrue Holiday and post Jrue Holiday
"Also: any 7-footer with Steph’s insane cardio, even if you compromised the shooting and handling slightly, is a perennial MVP candidate.   Imagine defenders of a similar size trying to chase this monstrosity through multiple screens the entire bloody game, and not being able to cheat towards either the basket or the line because he can finish confidently at both.  Jrue Holiday talks about getting mentally penetrated by KD, but this player would have fully grown men sobbing in the fetal position by the 3rd quarter."
And Jrue Holiday!
"dude no shit, it's impossible to know the value of anything. I said it's likely they'll get high pick(s), not a guarantee.  Look at the ""halls"" other players have fetched. All Houston got back for Harden was Oladipo and the Nets' picks (projected to be worse than Philly's if they got Dame). Look what AD went for, or PG or Jrue Holiday, etc. Basically every package is one young player with all-star potential, a couple young players as throw ins (maybe recent 1st rounders), and then as many picks &amp; swaps as teams' can offer.  It's also kind of funny you bring up Chris Paul because all it took to get him was Oubre, Rubio, and a first.  ***  &gt;Are you telling me I might have a good pick in 2028? Man that’s like no time in small market time. /s  I'd much rather be an OKC fan for the next 5-10 years than a Portland fan the next 5-10 years.  ***  Teams will be okay with paying Dame his 54M at the end of the contract as long as they get his most productive years up front. In 2-3 years, there will not be many teams eager to pay 34 year old Dame 50M/year. The first two years of that deal are what make him valuable, not the last 2.  Fact of the matter is, should Dame ask out and provide Portland with a shortlist of teams he wants to go to, their leverage will crumble and they'll succumb to his request. I apologize if that upsets you, but that's just how it works.  &gt;Boston is the only real answer for a trade that might even be palatable  How? What do they have to offer that's more valuable than Philly? I don't think they're willing to give up Brown in a deal for Dame.  &gt;Then I would still have more interest in Ingram than anything Philadelphia is making available.  Unless you take over Neil Oshey's job, this doesn't really matter. We have no idea who they matter, but it's moot if NOLA isn't on Dame's list.  &gt;Then I would probably rather have Siakim or Sabonis over Philadelphia’s garbage pile.  Again moot, unless you think Dame is interested in Toronto or Indy.  ***  You clearly just really don't like Simmons, which is fine. But you're letting that cloud your value far too severely. He's a 3 time all star and one of the best defensive perimeter players in the league. That's more than Sabonis, Siakam, Ingram, etc. We'll see if he can repair his image. But sometimes guys just have bad playoffs - like Dame in 2018 against the Pels.  ***  &gt;I’ll keep the asset I have under a 4 year contract and is the consummate professional. Thank you very much.  If that's what Dame wants, then it's 100% happening. But if he requests a trade he's gone, it's as simple as that. And should he ask out, it's hard to envision him going anywhere besides Philly, Golden State, or New York."
A fully realized Frank could’ve been Jrue Holiday.   Instead we got the sexiest bust in NBA history.
Not ideally - a pelicans/jrue holiday fan
Jrue Holiday.
"DIfferent year, different team. Are you trying to tell me that Jrue holiday takes y'all from a 5 game drubbing by the ""same"" team (where y'all only won one because giannis was out) to sweeping them? Give the man his fmvp then lmao."
"I think a lot of times the regular season narratives are highly driven by the previous postseason. I think this is the year where Jrue Holiday is going to get all of the pent up ""credit"" from the media/public for the past few years of elite defense.   Guys like JJ Redick have been touting him has the best defender in the league for a while, and given what he did in the postseason I think he's as good of a bet as any of the dark horses to win."
How nobody mention kawhi and jrue holiday?  Yeah Russ is vocal guy but I don’t think that he more locked guy then kawhi or jrue  CP3 also guy to mention right here  Klay also 🔐

"I could watch this all day. This video makes it seem like you can't really stop the best offensive players, only make it tough and hope they miss. Makes you appreciate players like Jrue Holiday, Dort, OG, Andre Roberson back in the day, etc."
"Jimmy buckets. Giannis. Lebron. Jrue Holiday.  Younger guys, Trae Young, Davion Mitchell, Luka."
I don’t think the position itself really matters. Just match him up with the guy that he’d be able to guard. It’s like how Ben Simmons is 6’10 but was guarding tre young in the playoffs or Jrue holiday guarding Paul George or Something.  Position isn’t as important as finding the right matchup. There’s always going to some differences in between matchups but teams make it work.
"&gt; Holiday is twice the player that Bledsoe is. Bledsoe was the reason the Bucks lost to the Heat, and Jrue is a much better replacement.  Spitting facts"
"To win today you need defense. Jrue Holiday won with defense. Last year Rondo won with defense. Before that Lowry won with defense. Before that, Klay won with defense. Hell even Steph is better on that end than Dame. 2011 Rose wins over Dame. Dame has CJ and Rose had Luol Deng"
"Jrue Holiday’s wife, Lauren Holiday, is a retired soccer player, she has 2 Olympic gold medals and a World Cup win with the US national team"
Can Jrue Holiday bring Dame?
Mike Conley Pops a 2x Gold medal track star    Jrue Holiday wife 2x golds in soccer &amp; fiba silver
Last I checked Jrue Holiday wasn't named Alex Caruso
"you just named Rondo ? a role player?   boogie who tore his achilles and didn’t play a min of playoffs?   nice job man. truly showed us all, Rondo and Jrue holiday is a stacked team now…when you have Cavs with Kyrie/Bron + supporting cast and Warriors w KD/Steph/Klay and then Houston with Chris paul and James Harden."
"bro that year he had Rondo…and and Jrue holiday and faced KD, Steph, Klay, Dray.   god you just don’t get it!!!!"
"You’re vastly overestimating his supporting cast. You overlooked Jrue Holiday was an Olympian and is an all star caliber player. The same goes for Middleton. McCollum is not as good as either of these guys.   Jurkic is also not as good as Lopez, who is a more well rounded player.   Portland is not winning a title as constructed. They will end up trading Lillard at some point. Or blowing things up to try and get more around him imo."
David Griffin. Pelicans botched the jrue holiday trade when they decided to get Steven Adams for some reason.
"uh injured James Harden and Blake Griffin vs Jrue Holiday Khris Middleton and tbh Brook Lopez playing better than Blake too is not ""even"""
Jrue holiday
"Yeah you have a point.   2013 all-star Jrue Holiday, who had 42 TS% against you, is basically the same as Kyrie or Harden."
Why do people (and the writer of this article) act like Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday aren’t among the best at their respective positions lol
Eric Bledsoe  Marcus Smart  Jrue Holiday
"Who, though?  Love is a net negative, so it'd have to be something like Jrue Holiday (borderline star I guess, and Bledsoe was a negative value contract), but what borderline star is going to want to come to Cleveland (must be a wing or guard, btw, with the #3 overall pick and $167m invested in the frontcourt) to make the future firsts worth it?  I just don't see the angle here."
Because he was really great before Kyrie went down.   I get he didn't perform like a 2nd option when he had to but also randomly being thrown into the role in the middle of the playoffs against Jrue Holiday isn't exactly setting somebody up to succeed.     Praising somebody for their team being shittier is a weird thing to do.

Yeah I think it goes Patrick Beverly —&gt; Jrue Holiday   Like a Magikarp to Gyrados type situation lol
"CP3 is more like CP13 with just how unlucky the guy is.   Goes to New Orleans, gets his trade to Lakers nulled by Stern, goes to the Clippers, injuries hampering the team's attempts from making it deep, goes to the Rockets, injuries again, gets traded to OKC, no expectations given to him and makes OKC vs Rockets some of the most insane baskebtall in the bubble, signs with Phoenix, and for all intents and purposes his luck came in really good with the West's players having a lot of injuries, but both East and West have had injuries and COVID complications throughout the year.   His bad luck came with meeting Giannis ""Kareem Abdul Magickeem"" who's on a fucking mission, K-Money who's going crazy, Jrue Holiday who I honestly like but the Bucks pretty much destroyed my hope of the Heat making it back into the finals this year, but at least we lost to them, and PJ Tucker wanting to get more money to get more shoes... The last is the most dangerous and I really need to avoid getting crossfaded on a Thurseday night."
TJ McConnel   Marcus Smart  Jrue Holiday  Extremly good defenders with a flawed offensive game that bring very good passing/playmaking and questionable shooting
Derrick White   Lonzo Ball   Jrue Holiday
"ben simmons' value never dropped to the level of: ""KCP+ Kuzma + 1st rounder?"", but I doubt it will ever reach to the level of Lillard. If portland ever decides to trade Lillard, they will have better offers than ben simmons. I am guessing Philly will lose Simmons to an okay package comparable to Jrue Holiday. at least 1 starter caliber player and 2-3 first round picks. that is it. Lillard can get, 4 first rounders and young talent. There are teams who can offer that kind of a package for Lillard or even Beal before Simmons."
Jrue Holiday  Marcus Smart     Patrick Beverley
"Davion Mitchell  Peak Matthew Dellavedova  Jrue Holiday  Lead guards with an elbow centric off ball game, a three point shot that at least demands respect, and an ability to get to the basket with a simple hesi and a shoulder down. They play very close, full court defense against opposing perimeter players and are vocal leaders on the defensive end."
"Pat Bev, Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday"
Pat Bev - Marcus Smart - Jrue Holiday
I also like “it’s a holiday” for Jrue but that’s not a nickname obviously      As far as nicknames I haven’t seen Turkish Thunder listed here and I always liked that one.
"I won’t get into an argument of tearing Lamar Odom down because I like him. But the media and the league disagrees with you considering he was never an All Star, won 1 Sixth Man of the Year award and was on the All-Rookie team. That’s it for his career. Whereas a guy like Jrue Holiday was an All Star and has numerous awards. But whatever man. I won’t talk down on Odom."
Jrue Holiday *Justin Holiday *Aaron Holiday
Jrue Holiday.
"You do realize the Bucks made a pretty major move in acquiring Jrue Holiday right? Not sure how you can downplay that as a major acquisition.      Uh, sick burn though."
"Rebounds are meaningless? Thats the most ridiculous thing Ive heard. Regardless of what position youre in, points rebounds and assists are 3 major stats that MATTERS. Having 2.2 extra points and 4 more rebounds beats 2.7 more assists and 1.5 less turnovers lol  Lmao what a dumb argument. If you swap Jrue Holiday/CP3 or lets say Butler with Steph from 2017-2019 Jrue wld have the rings and Steph would have 0 as well. Does that make CP3/Jrue/Butler better than Steph? Blazers was way deeper than Warriors last season as well even though Warriors had the better no. 2 and 3. Lillard wasnt even as efficient as Steph even though he had more spacing. His 3p% literally hit &gt;40% once in his career. Theres absolutely no way Lillard is on Steph level. Dude is barely a top 10 player.  KD, Lebron, Steph, Giannis, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, AD, Harden are all better. The only one that is debatable is Lillard &gt; AD."
"Marcus Smart or Jrue Holiday - but Smart is 27 and Holiday is 31, so the former is more likely."
"jrue holiday, lugentz dort, thybulle."
Cause Defense is effort level based reason Jrue looks so good on the EYE Test is litteraly cause he's been doing it Longer he turns his Steals and Smothering D into Highlights Alley Oops and stuff Dort can't do that Yet when it comes to On Ball Defense Dort is Jrue Holiday level and when Dort gets those highlights we will be changing the Narrative Again
Add Jrue Holiday to your team.
76ers - They are pretty good not the best......process years really where a horrible time   Jrue Holiday   Iggy  Jimmy Butler  Jeremi Grant  Vuc
Pelicans:  Chris Paul  Jrue Holiday   Trevor Ariza  Anthony Davis  Demarcus Cousins
"What ""increasingly bad Jrue trade""? The Pelicans still retain two unprotected firsts and two pick swaps from that trade, and just turned Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams into Jonas Valaciunas.  All for *one season* of Jrue Holiday – after Holiday asked for a trade specifically to a contender (so Griffin more or less had to trade Jrue, and only to a relatively small number of teams).  Under the circumstances, that trade was, and remains awesome for the Pelicans."
"Why did you ignore the rest of my comment?   In the 2020 playoffs, AD averaged 28 points and 10 rebounds a game with what we can unanimously call elite defense.  Khris Middleton averaged 24 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists per game.   Jrue Holiday averaged 17 points, 6 rebounds and 9 assists per game with what we can call elite defense.  So sure, AD outplayed either of them individually. But their output was right there, and more speaks to the overall superior roster construction of that Bucks squad. Those 2 killed it in the playoffs even if they had off nights (as AD also infamously did, if you want to choose to remember that).  Want to know who the third leading scorer on those Lakers was? KCP, at a whopping 11 a game.  Idk, I think ignoring most of what someone says, taking things out of context and then diminishing how well a team played in order to prop someone up is pretty nephew material. I have stats backing me up, you have insults. Grow up."
"Acting like Jrue Holiday doesn't exist I see.   I like the Bucks and am glad they won, but they would have lost to the Nets if 2/3 of their starters didn't get hurt, and even then almost lost to KD by himself. Then it was a battle of injury attrition vs the Hawks. Then when you got to the finals you played the Suns, who waltzed through an injury depleted West.  Say what you will about the Lakers finals opponent, but they had swept the Bucks that year, so they weren't exactly scrubs. And they kept beating teams that everyone acted like were amazing Western Conference Opponents until the Lakers wrecked them, then they suddenly sucked.   Idk, I think it's best to enjoy the championships and not throw stones all over."
"I really doubt you watch more Nuggets game than I had the past 4 years, you’re just behind multiple burners taking on different team flairs dude, stats are cute but you would know better if you actually watch games, or unless you just a huge homer that you can’t just deal with it.  Murray playmaking is average at best, he’s not that PnR savant, not ideal to be a primarily lead guard in an offensive engine if he was to be put as a number 1 guy.. hence like I said he’s a combo guard. Murray works best with Jokic in PnR and their 2 men game and chemistry are what drive Murray play making much better..  For me Murray is like on the same playmaking tier as Jrue Holiday or Kemba Walker. His passing out of PnR into cross court corner 3 are not even as accurate as say someone like Dame or Conley.. and he’s of course way behind than the likes of Brogdon or Fox when it comes to playmaking.  Also you’re already flat out wrong about Murray and Brown defense being a tie. Take the L boi. Murray for the most part have been below average on that end, on ball and off ball were bad, got better off ball first, then recently got better on ball but by no means it’s a toss up when it comes to comparing him to Jaylen Brown. Brown is a multi positional defender able to check 2-4, He clamped Pascal Siakam in the Playoffs all by himself for example. He can legit provide lock down defense where as Murray has been more a liability on that end more often than not."
They *recieved* 3 draft picks in the Bledsoe / Adams deal while trading Jrue Holiday and you’re telling me this is a win now attempt?
"KPJ has played plenty of official NBA games lol what?  Hell he dropped 50 and 10 in an official NBA game against Jrue Holiday, multiple time first team all-defense selection."
"I'm curious as to who you think the all star guards will be next year. I like Lonzo well enough but never saw him breaking into the ASG. Trae Young, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton all missed out on all star last year as potential guards. Even if you're knocking Simmons out that's a rough crew to cut from.  But it is very bold, I'll give you that."
"Jrue ""mentally penetrating"" Holiday"
"&gt;When was the last time Jrue was seriously injured?  Past 3 years alone  [https://www.foxsports.com/nba/jrue-holiday-player-injuries](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/jrue-holiday-player-injuries)   &gt;Injuries are part of the game. They gambled on Kyrie and KD and Blake and lucked out on KD and Blake. Harden being out is also part of the game.  Harden is the most durable superstar maybe ever. Him getting injured is proof that this was a fluke. If luck is part of the game, then Bucks get all the credit for being lucky.  This was the season with the most injuries ever, on top of the COVID anamolies. It was an outlier season, and an outlier ring.   &gt;Bucks also lost Divincenzo so it’s not like their whole team was in because of luck.  Obviously Divincienzo = Kyrie &amp; Harden  If everyone's remotely healthy, obviously Nets in 4/5. Even if one of Kyrie/Harden is healthy then it's a win in 5/6"
"They beat as many dangerous teams in the West during 2015 that the Heat beat over 2013/2014.   Along the way to the finals they beat the Pelicans (45-37) limited with Jrue Holiday injury, Grizzlies (55-27) Grit and Grind Grizzlies, and Rockets (56-26) post whatever the fuck the previous year rockets were into a good Harden supporting cast where Josh Smith plays the way he imagines he does.  During the Heat's 2013 run they had the terrifying east gauntlet of Bucks (38-44) whose best player was Monta ""have it all"" Ellis, Bulls (45-37) pre-all star Butler/ injured Rose but prime Joakim Noah, and Indiana (49-33) actually a good team with ultimate verticality Hibbert.  In their 2014 run, they beat Charlotte (43-39) the Al Jefferson show featuring pre all star Kemba Walker, Brooklyn (44-38) fine team but this is also the year Deron/Garnett declined, Indiana (56-26) another good team where PG3 improved and Roy Hibbert did the opposite.  The 2015 Warriors run had them go threw 3 all nba members just in the West which was as many as the Heat went through in 2013+2014 in the East."
Honorable mention to Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday for jumping on a plane and heading over the day after they won the NBA Finals.
"If the 2015-2017 Cavs are a superteam by virtue of having one superstar and two All Stars then the 2021 Bucks should also be considered a superteam. And so should the 2019 Raptors.   Also, this idea that a superteam can’t be homegrown makes no sense. As if there is only one way to build a team. But even under that definition, the Cavs had one guy they drafted (Kyrie), one guy they drafted who returned (LeBron), and one guy they traded for (Love). And their fourth best player (Thompson) was also drafted by them. That’s not materially different than what the Bucks did to acquire their roster. Last I checked Jrue Holiday wan’t drafted by the Bucks. Nor were any of the role players who played a part in their championship (Connaughton, Portis, Tucker, Forbes, Teague, etc.)."
Jrue Holiday
"This isn’t a me thing, it’s an NBA thing.   If you don’t like it blame Kerr or D’Antoni.  https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2019/12/18/21026962/miami-heat-jimmy-butler-positionless-jrue-holiday-trade  https://www.denverstiffs.com/platform/amp/2020/7/17/21328531/nba-positionless-basketball-the-future-or-a-waystation-denver-nuggets-jokic-bol-bol"
"Advanced stats are a great tool to judge players. Not all advanced stats are weighted equally. Anyone who knows anything about basketball knows how difficult it is to measure defense — that list you shared is a prime example. Jrue Holiday is widely regarded as an elite defender, yet is only a few slots above Russ? If you look at offensive stats, like TS% or VORP, it gives you a way more accurate representation. You can cherry pick random stats where Russ has the edge over Harden, but they aren’t relevant. Please do your own research. Look into defensive metrics in the NBA and find me a source that proves I’m wrong."
"Okay? Your saying that PG didn’t deserve to be clowned for what happened in the bubble or while he was with the thunder? His teams were favorites in all those series and they failed.  The only time you can have a go at dame is against the pelicans and even then, he was up against one of the best perimeter players in the league in Jrue Holiday in what was only his 4th season."
"Props to KD for participating in the Olympics, but why exactly is his sacrifice any greater than any of the other guys who participated? Couldn't they all use some rest before the next season?  If anything, Jrue Holiday, Kris Middleton, and Devonte Booker needed the rest the most as they had literally no break between the end of the playoff season and the start of the Olympics."
OG should be higher. Marcus smart is a better defender than jrue holiday
"Let’s not act like Zach Lavine, DLo, and Wiggins, and Jimmy Butler were trash offensively. They drew their share of attention too. Sure, AD’s got Bron. Before that, Prime Boogie and to some degree, Jrue Holiday. I think the shot selection comes down to just the skill and the IQ of it. Don’t act like KAT was getting double and triple teamed all the time."
1. Stephen Curry  2. Damian Lillard 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Trae Young 5. Chris Paul 6. Ja Morant 7. Jrue Holiday 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Ben Simmons 10. Russell Westbrook  That's their top 10
"Trae does better tbh and would unlock these guys who you claim ""dont need to be guarded"" and use them as weapons  Look at Dame in 2018 being guarded by Jrue Holiday vs Trae this year. Trae put up 28/7 lol"
"If you value playoff performances highly then Jrue Holiday should be ranked in the Top 5, at the very least.  I think Holiday is the best perimeter defensive player in the league rn."
"You said Jrue Holiday is a more impactful defender than Gobert, your opinion is irrelevant"
"Easy to talk about ""team building"" when a top 5 all-time superstar leaves a team that just made the Finals to come save your worthless dumpster fire that'd been rotting in the lottery for 7 straight years. If LeBron had decided to go to NOLA with AD the Pelicans would have ""built"" a 10x better team than your shambolic mish-mash of mostly non-shooting ring chasing old veterans because they had prime Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic, 2 players who complement Bron's playstyle better than anything your wack FO has ever surrounded him with since he got there outside of AD.   Just admit your just as stupid bandwagoner like all the rest of you Lakers flairs on this sub, without even the slightest iota of self-awareness or objectivity about this shit kiddo. Don't waste yours or anyone else's time typing up pointless theses like this that still fall apart from a one sentence rebuttal. Try enjoying your title winning team that gets superstars flocking to play for you even when you don't remotely deserve it instead of being bitter on reddit for a change. Never seen a ""championship"" team's fanbase ever be so miserable about it like y'all have been lmao. Guess it's cause deep down you know you didn't deserve the chain of events that lead to it in any way shape or form..."
"That's a pretty whatever foul call, that's what a ton of steals are. The Jrue Holiday steal on Devin Booker in the Finals was similar, Ben Simmons had steals like that on Trae, it is what it is."
"""Jrue Holiday is underrated"" has been a common narrative for like 3 years now. Like, it's not true lol he's properly rated at this point."
"You’re right! Many people say that it was Giannis that won them, but we gotta admire Jrue Holiday, the biggest step between Bucks losing in the semis back to back for last 2 years was Bledsoe. Jrue Holiday literally defended so well"
To me jrue holiday is top 3.. too underrated.
"You still need your point guard to contribute to your defensive system though. That's what Curry does well. People underrate him because there are clips of Kyrie cooking him in the Finals, but Kyrie cooks everyone. What people don't see is how Curry rarely misses rotations, knows where to funnel ball handlers, and is a nuisance in passing lanes. Not having Jrue Holiday level clamps doesn't mean he isn't useful on that end"
A better scorer by every single metric? I mean I haven't looked at direct comparisons and I don't doubt he can pop off for a series or two but thats a hell of a take when we're talking about someone who was a big toe from knocking out the champion Bucks by himself. Kawhi needs a complementary team way more than KD does and that speaks volumes. And you're kind of disregarding that Kawhi was playing the defensively questionable Mavs while KD was putting up more points against Jrue Holiday and a very defensively sound Bucks team.
Booker played with Mike James Elfrid Peyton Brandon Knight  AD played with Jrue Holiday/Playoff Rondo.  Nice try though
"Jrue Holiday has been one of the better point guards in the league since 2013 when he got an all star selection. Even now it’s incredibly to see people say he’s overrated when we just saw how important he was to his teams success. A lot of people here massively undervalue defensive ability, it makes me doubt how many people actually watch NBA games and just watch highlight videos instead. A highlight reel on YouTube will never convey a players ability or game, you need to watch them play a full 48 minute NBA game."
"Jrue just averaged 17/9/6 in the playoffs and played some of the best guard defense we have seen for a championship team. Sign me up for that all day long. Put Marcus Smart on the Bucks instead of Holiday and the bucks struggle in the first round, lose to the nets, probably lose to the hawks, and lose to the Suns"
"Not going to argue too much for defence, but having a guard that can defend the likes of john collins, capela &amp; ayton, probably was key for a defence like Milwaukee’s.  I do wish he didn’t shoot as much, his awful shooting was likely a combination of fatigue from chasing booker/cp3 around screens + lack of team sets for him.  However to say that he is bad offensively, or that he is close to Marcus Smart is wrong IMO. Jrue Holiday is the primary playmaker of a championship team, just averaged a series high 9 assist in the finals with the best Ast/TO ratio against the Point God himself. CP3 wasn’t exactly surrounded by scrubs either. Bridges, Crowder, Booker, Ayton."
"Jrue Holiday played a big part in killing us defensively in the first round.   Dragic, Herro and Nunn were all ineffective with Jrue hounding them. Especially since Dragic couldn't find any type of rhythm, our offense was mostly hope Jimmy or Bam could make something happen or Duncan bails us out, which worked in game 1, but not in games 2-4"
"So many players on this sub go from underrated to overrated so quickly. Guys like Jrue Holiday and Devin Booker being hella overrated and being called top 20 players when they arent meanwhile a year ago they were called empty stat guys and were underrated.  Wonder who is gonna be the next person this sub does a 180 on, Lavine? Sexton?"
Malik Monk - Monk   Marcus Smart - smart  Jrue Holiday - Holiday (mardigra)  Rodney Hood - Hood
"I don’t think Hachimura can be your second scoring option on a championship level team, but I want him to have that chance so he can develop and then ideally play a Jrue Holiday role on a team with real aspirations."
"I mean it's totally true. Whether or not those titans you mentioned are called two-way players is actually irrelevant, in fact it's maybe even worse that people use that term to describe them because the exact same term is also bestowed upon top ~40 guys like Jrue Holiday lol."
Guys like Jimmy Butler and Jrue Holiday?  For example Jrue shot like absolutely dog shit except probably  3 games in the playoffs. On par with Bledsoe   But his defense kept him on the court as a plus-impacy player . And eventually he had the best game of his career vs Suns G5
KD has also said that he thinks Jrue Holiday is the best defender at the guard position
"I'm not comparing Jrue and Simmons. The guy I was wasting my time talking to was comparing Pat Bev and Jrue (he studiously avoided talking about Simmons once I brought up Draymond and Giannis, in fact), and I was responding to that.  He was saying that Ben's performance in DPOY voting ought to be sufficient evidence to establish him as the best defender in the league (and then, after he realized that was a losing argument, that the voting ought to be enough to establish Ben as the best *non-center* defender in the league). My point was that it is unwise to rely on media voting as any reliable barometer of how good a player is as a defender, and I used PatBev as an example that illustrates my point. While the media thinks very highly of Beverley, his peers really do not, as evidenced by things they've said (""Pat Bev trick y'all, man; running around, doing nothing"") and more importantly, by things they've done (relentlessly targeting him every.time.down.the.court in crunchtime of a playoff game). PatBev being on some reporters' All-Defense team doesn't necessarily make him a good defender; good defenders don't get hunted down and exploited whenever a team needs a bucket in a playoff game.   Then he came out with some nonsensical take that because Durant had scored on Holiday, that means Holiday is a Beverley-level defender. Besides again ducking my point (that media voting isn't always an accurate reflection of reality), that's a silly thing to say because it indicates a lack of understanding of how playoff offense works. Holiday never got targeted in the same way that Beverley did. In the playoffs, when things come down to the wire, teams manufacture points by forcing switches until they've put their best or hottest or most well-rested scorer on the weakest individual defender on the court, and then they attack that defender. That's how the game gets played late. You can't be that target, as PatBev was, and still be considered an All-Defense caliber guy. Jrue was never targeted like that. Occasionally there were mismatches, which can happen to anyone--especially point guards. But the Nets were not hunting Holiday for sixteen seconds every possession until his coach needed to pull him off the floor to stop the bleeding, as happened to the Clips with Beverley.  The Durant-Jrue example was just especially funny because of Durant's well-documented claims about Jrue."
"This benefits Portland, Philly can get a better deal than CJ McCollum. Portland would have to offer much more for Simmons than just CJ.   And you keep saying all star in the east. He didnt even beat out Mike Conley as a reserve in the west. How is he going to beat out Harden, Kyrie, Butler, Beal, Westbrook,  Lavine, Trae Young, and I'll stop at Jrue Holiday. And those are just the guards in the east bro. 8 that you can put before CJ. That doesn't even include Simmons who is better than CJ and is listed as a Guard/Forward."
I love these fun facts. My favourite used to be that Mason Plumlee (2013 draft) is older than Jrue Holiday (2009 draft)
"Jrue Holiday, Kris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irvin, Jaylen Brown. None of those are first options"
"Honestly you could make an argument for the Jrue Holiday trade, yea we got a shit ton of picks in return, but in the end a ring is the most coveted thing you can get."
"Same could probably be said of the Jrue Holiday trade last year, seemed like an overpay. But if he's the one to push your team to a championship, worth."
"I remember thinking this past off season..”another disappointing season from the Bucks , and all they did to improve was get Jrue Holiday?!” I didn’t think Giannis would take such a monster leap forward. And Jrue came through for them in key moments. Man was I wrong, and I couldn’t be happier about it"
"""Jrue Holiday is only a slight upgrade over Eric Bledsoe, LOL when Giannis leaves next year and you don't have your picks."""
"Lol, weak! One clip of a clear-out post-up (which was not what I asked for, btw: I asked for clear evidence that the Nets repeatedly targeted Holiday on switches and made attacking him the focal point of their offense, like the Mavs did with Beverley), and an ""I'm not gonna go looking for clips. I assumed you would remember"" cop-out, on top of that.  Also, does your back ache from moving those goalposts so much?  To review:  First, you claimed that Ben Simmons was the best defender in the league;  Next, you claimed that, well actually, Ben Simmons WOULD BE the best defender in the league if not for the (pretty fucking relevant!) fact that centers are the most important defenders in the league, even going so far as to use the word ""disproportionate"" to imply that there was something vaguely unfair about the defensive prominence of the center position;  Next, you completely avoided engaging with the evidence that Simmons was outperformed statistically by no fewer than five non-centers, AND ducked assessing Simmons's value relative to Draymond and Giannis;  Next, you argued that media voting ought to be enough to establish Simmons's bona fides as best defender, apparently regardless of the eye test and of statistical analysis;  Then, rather then engage with any of the evidence or arguments I presented you with, you suggested that I don't watch basketball;   Then, when confronted with incontrovertible visible evidence that I actually do know what the fuck I am talking about, you constructed a straw-man using Jrue Holiday and Kevin Durant, neglecting to observe the fact that Durant himself is on record as believing that Jrue is the best perimeter defender in the league;  Finally, when asked to provide any evidence in support of your ludicrous claim that Holiday was targeted in a manner similar to the way Pat Bev was, you showed me a video of 6'11 Durant successfully scoring in the post over 6'3 Holiday (who, remember, Durant himself believes is the best perimeter defender in the game!).  It's been real, nephew. I've had fun, but I'm going to dip. You can have the last word, if it'll make you feel better."
"Can you provide me with any statistical or video evidence that the Nets deliberately and repeatedly attempted to iso Durant on Jrue, rather than other, less heralded defenders on the Bucks? Because I just shared with you multiple instances of that very thing happening to Beverley.   It's one thing to get switched into a bad matchup from time to time. It's another to be locked in on and literally played off the floor, as Beverley was in Game 2. That never happened to Holiday in the Nets series, and the Nets did not repeatedly go after Holiday with KD or with anyone else.  Also, the Durant on Holiday example is exceptionally poorly chosen on your part, since Durant himself has said that he thinks [Jrue is the best defender in the league](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUAsPUbbc20)"
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
"Jrue wanted out and they did right by him while also acquiring some draft picks. That is the beginning and end to all your questions regarding Bledsoe and why they didn't keep Holiday. I'm not sure where the disconnect is there. They clearly thought committing to Van Gundy was the right approach, as with signing Adams, both of which were mistakes they quickly got out of. Again, I just don't see the doom and gloom, they've got great young talent and space to build around it and they are trying a course correction."
"He turned 23 years old earlier this June.   That'd be like saying Jrue Holiday isn't on Giannis timeline since he's 5 years older. I'd get it if he was 28, but it's very common for teams to have a veteran star when tryna compete even if OKC's window is 4-5 years from now."
That's like a Jrue Holiday level haul right htere
Is there any reason they can’t just do a better version of the jrue holiday deal the bucks did and sell their future
"No, but can Jrue holiday go get you a bucket easily…no.  Jrue is not a first/second option offensively on a good team. Ingram definitely can be.   In a lot of ways yes SGA is better. Not particularly for what the bucks needed, but to run a good offense, be a first option, and scoring efficiently and effectively SGA is just flat out better and it’s not close. They specialize in different things."
"Right, Jrue Holiday for Eric Bledsoe-level moves only 💯 💪🏼 🔥"
"It's a mindset for a lot of players and fans in basketball - the notion that you must hate your opponent in order to beat him. I'll always enjoy the sportsmanship displayed by guys like Jrue Holiday, Bobby Portis, Steve Nash, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, and players alike."
"lol, I remember when Jrue Holiday said on some nights he needs to be more aggressive and Kenny Smith said that he was aggressive every single night. Straight cap."
"This is starting to be the prevailing take and it's because we tend to put the blinders on to the past. Last year the biggest story surrounding the off-season was whether or not Giannis was going to stay in Milwaukee. The extension was out there but he wasn't signing it straight off. The common thought was that he wanted the organization to show him they were serious about winning. So they mortgaged off a large portion of their future to get Holiday, and then he signed. If it was crystal clear that he just absolutely loves Milwaukee, and is so loyal to them and the team, and was going to sign the extension no matter what then there's *no way* the Bucks pay the price they did for Jrue.  His title might be sweeter *to him* but no one is gonna give a fuck in a few years about the ""harder"" road. Frankly, it wasn't that hard to hold the idea of not signing your extension over the organization until they trade 3 first round picks and 2 pick swaps to get you more help."
"If you want team loyalty there's Damian Lillard and the Portland Trailblazers. He's arguably  the first player that pops up in my mind whenever I hear the word ""loyal"" in the NBA (mostly because he preaches it himself). Their history is also pretty respectable, they've had the Bill Walton days and their first ring, then moved on to the Clyde Drexler days, then the Oden - Aldridge - Roy days, and now the Damian Lillard era. Their social media team is good, they interact a lot with fans. Their organization is meh, their aim every season is to become a good playoff team with no championship aspirations (although now that Dame is demanding them to make moves for a championship). I would be really careful tho, there has been reports that Dame could want out of Portland so take that as you will.  Another team that screams loyalty is the Milwaukee Bucks. The history is composed of the Kareem days (one of the GOATs in basketball) winning their first championship, then to the Ray Allen days (late 90s to early 00s) and then to the Michael Redd era, then to the Brandon Jennings era. From then on, it has been downhill but their lives would change when they drafted their superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was once a Greek kid that came to America with literally nothing, and he was alone here, trying to carve a role here in the NBA. He has been through some absolute highs and lows with this Bucks team (at least from when he was a rookie up to now), and now he's one of the most beloved players in the league right now. They had 2 seasons of being contenders (one was where they kind of flopped after everyone expected them to win) and now he has carried the Bucks to its 2nd championship, along with Khris Middleton (another loyal guy who stuck with the Bucks together with Giannis) and Jrue Holiday (a guy they traded for). Their fan interaction is crazy, they have this running gag with player Bobby Portis where he's absolutely a fan favorite and they chant his name every game and stuff. They have a youtube channel where they show behind the scenes stuff (this is why i became a fan, i binged it all and they look so absolutely cool). Their org is also meh (but only recently they did good, they've done more sus moves like Kidd hiring and draft fuckups like DJ Wilson and Thon Maker).  Overall supporting these teams would be really fun especially the Bucks, since they all seem to be really chill."
"He made a ton of mistakes in the USA v France game too. He was making mistakes like calling Jrue Holiday ""Bam Adebayo"" multiple times."
BREAKING: Booker asks to be traded to play along side Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton in Milwaukee
Poor Muhammad jahdicirnsocvotekaovfnabadi was 1-11 at one point. Jrue holiday esque
Is your username supposed to be Jrue Holiday?
"I actually heavily disagree there. Siakam is a better scorer and good defender too.   While I may agree Jrue may be a better player as a pure ceiling raiser, what Siakam and Westbrook are able to do with lesser talent compared to what Holiday can is too much for me to look over. Holiday could not do what Siakam and Westbrook have done in the last two years, and Holiday is just as inefficient as both of them too"
"I totally can. People don’t realize that McCollum consistently ups his game in the playoffs. He has been the best player for his teams in series (Second round 2019) and while he may not fit certain teams, he’s a much better shooter and scorer. The Blazers would specifically yes take the trade because the blazers already have another McCollum similarity of being undersized weak defender in Lillard.  I didn’t say Simmons look up. Green I think is, he’s a better defender than Jrue from overall standpoint due to position, almost as good passer, and is a better ceiling raiser (Neither are good floor raisers).  Sabonis and Vucevic may not be better ceiling raisers as they are not as role specific, but they simply can be good first efficient scoring options, something that holiday could never do (even as a 3rd option he shoots like shit)"
Jrue Holiday has kneeled before Draymond Green….
Jrue Holiday is 100% not better than Kyrie.
Jrue Holiday has entered the chat...
"a) 34 assists on 42 made fg.   b) Jrue ""+/-"" Holiday with the +32 to lead the team.  3) Lillard going 7/13 from three.  yeeeaaaahhhh.  THAT'S the stuff."
"First off, you edited your comment after I replied. Have a spine.  Second, what the hell does “third best player” in quotes even mean? He is literally the third best player on the Nets. Jrue holiday could also be a first option or second option on the Kings or Thunder, but he is the *third best player on the Bucks*. There isn’t room for interpretation here lol"
"First of all, I'm very happy for Giannis.  But he's not everything that is great about basketball.  He's an athletic freak who used his incredible natural gifts to be great.  If anyone Jrue Holiday is who represents everything that is great about basketball much better- though practice, perseverance, effort, and athleticism combined you can be great."
"In a vacuum by my definition is basically by most scenarios I would rather have DeMar, however I would still pick Jrue under the right circumstances.  For example his current team, the Bucks, I would rather have Jrue than DeRozan because his defense and his ability to hit the 3 outweighs DeMar's playmaking and ability to iso the mid-range.  And just for the hell of it let's take the Spurs as the other example. I'd rather have DeMar than Holiday on that team.  All in all, I think their value is about the same but their strength differ. Plus I've always had a spot for my boy from Toronto."
Jrue Holiday is my new favorite player
Jrue Holiday giving NBA Champion like minutes
"You'd think those exhibition losses would do it, but that French loss might've been the zenkai boost the US needed.   Also, Jrue Holiday isn't fresh off a flight."
Like my uncle would say... Jrue Holiday is a problem!
"Lillard, KD, DBook, Adebayo, and Jrue holiday are starters"
"Best? Who cares  I’m going PJ Tucker, Draymond Green, Ben Simmons, Jokic, Jrue Holiday"
I'd compare him to Jrue Holiday because of his defense
"Absolutely. If the Pelicans had somehow succeeded with Jrue after AD left, Holiday would have been a dark-horse MVP candidate. Holiday started games at the 2, finished games at the 1, guaranteed the opponents best perimeter player on every possession while also being the first option on offense. Lonzo can't do all that. At least not yet."
"Is chemistry really gonna make Kevin Durant make a wide open jumper? Or Jrue Holiday?  They were in that position because they missed those shots, they were literally winning, they start bricking everything and France comes back"
in no universe is lonzo ball a better player than jrue holiday. the lakers traded him for a reason.
"&gt;Don’t start off your argument by calling someone you disagree with a “casual”.  I can choose my words however I'd like and I choose to call you a casual based on your lack of understanding.  &gt;As for the actual players, there are arguments on both sides. You can’t just say that people “can’t prove otherwise” because we literally just saw Giannis defeat KD in the playoffs and then hoist the Larry O’Brian and Bill Russell trophies.  Except that doesn't prove anything. By that same logic, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are better than KD as well. The best player in the Bucks vs Nets series was KD and just because the Bucks beat the Nets doesn't make Giannis better than KD lmao. Like I said earlier you have nothing to prove Giannis is better than KD."
"Dame for Jrue Holiday, Nwora and Donte??  if he demands the Bucks and nowhere else.    Dame for THT, Kuzma and KCP, 2021 and 2027 FRP???  if he demands Lakers and nowhere else  Dame/Middleton/Giannis vs Dame/AD/LeBron  What is the better fit for him? I say Lakers still"
"Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Jonathan Isaac, Marcus Smart, De,Aaron Fox and Paul George are all some of my favorite players. If you couldnt tell I enjoy watching good perimeter defense"
Jrue Holiday wasn’t a bum but he had some bad luck with his wife
Jrue holiday and healthy all nba center Demarcus cousins. Also Rondo and Mirotic. The off season after we swept the blazers was the same one he was telling teammates that summer he wasn’t coming back
"&gt;The only issue is I only see Draymond, Bam, Jrue Holiday, and possibly Middleton understanding this concept though (I guess Keldon and Jeremi Grant might but they just aren’t good enough).  Nah. When CP3 was hot in the playoffs, Booker knew to defer to him. He can do the same to KD."
It’s debateable if the 2019 Raptors even beat the 2021 Bucks much less smoke them lol  Jrue Holiday is a night and day upgrade over Eric Bledsoe
"Turning Jrue holiday, turner, Thad young, Jason Richardson, spencer Hawes, nick Young, and Dorrell Wright into Embiid, the Ben Simmons pick, and a lot of other capital is hardly just cashing a check and sending it in."
Does Presti view SGA like Hinkie viewed Jrue Holiday? Good player who can’t be the best player on a title team who would bring in a ton of assets right now?   Not saying that’s the correct approach but am interest in Presti’s thought process if he does actually trade away SGA.
"Jonny Flynn was never going to be an elite NBA PG and people forget the Wolves drafted Ty Lawson 18th as well but traded him away.  Wolves passed on Jrue Holiday, too."
"What are the long-term effects of SGA's injury from this year? Do they think it could be lingering and restrict his future?  I think OKC is also trying to do the Sixers' ""trust the process"" model, with SGA being their Jrue Holiday. Outside of SGA, what do they currently have and what could they possibly bring in this year, to make them compete in the next year or two? If nothing, then SGA is merely going to make them a bottom of the lottery team and they are almost for sure not going to get that second star.  They probably just feel like they're stuck between a rock and a hard place, especially with the disaster of a lottery this year. Had a decent chance to get two top 5 picks and end up with just #6.  However, it's also why I disagree with a lot of people who think Presti has done an incredible job with his trades. Draft picks really aren't that valuable generally. And we saw how it's turned out for them this year."
"&gt;that can get them over the top  Lowry is not ""getting us over the top"" of anything lmfao. He would've gotten locked up by Jrue Holiday just like CP3"
So the only player that gives a shit up there is Jrue Holiday huh?
"Ya no doubt. Not saying he can’t or won’t improve. He’s a really good player, but I’m not a huge bad shot taker/maker fan, and from what I’ve seen, he takes a lot of tough shots. Maybe it’s the after effects of watching jrue holiday stalk this dude for 6 games"
"We’ve gotta get Francis and Kostas to the bucks any way we can. Starting five of 4 Antetokounmpo’s and Jrue, with the other two Holiday brothers on the bench"
"Rotation needs to be cut down by a lot. No need to be playing Keldon Johnson 9 mins. KD was in a bit of foul trouble vs France which can explain why he only played 20 mins, but he needs to be playing 30+ in important games going forward. One of Bam/Draymond needs to be on the floor at all times in any important game. I really don’t see the need for Lavine to be starting or even playing at all. Middleton, Holiday, and Booker are strictly better and should take over all of his minutes by the elimination stage.   The next two games for Team USA should be easy to win, so Pop should use those 2 games to get a fixed gameplay/style of play and to find the right number of players in the shortened rotation. The biggest problem is there is no identity with this team. It’s not even the lack of chemistry - it’s not like Luka played with Mike Tobey prior to the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Matisse Thybulle never played with Australia prior to the Olympics. The Nigeria team that beat Team USA in the exhibition had even fewer reps playing with each other than the US team did. It’s just that guys like Mike Tobey and Matisse Thybulle know their role.   Players like Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker, etc. don’t know their role on this team - it needs to be made clear to them they play defense and play more of a 3rd/4th option to KD/Lillard on offense or they get benched. That’s why it’s easier for Jrue Holiday to adjust - he already played this role with the Bucks, unlike the other stars who were #1 options on their teams. And if you don’t want to bench or threaten to bench Jayson Tatum or Zach Lavine for the entire game because they are “too good” be benched, well that’s why they won’t win."
"So is Jrue Holiday worth $30 million shooting 30%? But Ben Simmons isn’t worth it averaging more rebounds and assists scoring the same amount of points but on 55% shooting? It’s easy to rip somebody over 1 bad playoffs, but that doesn’t take away from how good Ben Simmons is"
"It's too bad Boogie didn't win a ring with the Warriors or that would be a 3rd guy they let walk.  ""Sorry I couldn't beat the warriors with Jrue Holiday and half a season of Boogie Cousins!"" I learn my recent NBA history from classic GoZ lines."
"Pop needs to actually just tell the players that KD is the #1 option, Lillard is the #2 option and everyone else play like role players. That means Jayson Tatum will only be spacing the floor/spotting  up/playing defense from now on. Zach Lavine will only be taking open jump shots/focusing on defense…etc. The only issue is I only see Draymond, Bam, Jrue Holiday, and possibly Middleton understanding this concept though (I guess Keldon and Jeremi Grant might but they just aren’t good enough).   This next game (since the USA is guaranteed to win) would be a good time to practice this concept in the first few quarters where Durant clearly is the lead dog and everyone else plays more specialized roles. Look how Luka played with Slovenia last night. This is how Team USA should structure their team, with clearly a pecking order. And it’s not like Luka had much “chemistry” with guys like Mike Tobey beforehand so this isn’t some chemistry issue that doesn’t affect other teams (Nigeria beat Team USA and their team is even newer than the one USA has). Otherwise players like Lavine and possibly even Tatum, despite how good he might be, should get benched imo since they don’t offer anything extra of value."
"&gt;20/50s of thybulle’s most guarded players by playing time were not starters  So you're saying he mostly guarded starters...  As well as primary bench ball handlers like Burks/Clarkson/TJ  &gt; Thybulles 10 longest assignments were...  There's an availability issue here. Philly is in the East, there's less quality guards in the east.  Don't really see what the point of comparing him to OG is when OG is a forward and Thybulle is a guard. Thybulle can't guard Randle, but OG would struggle vs a guy like Fox.  &gt; I’m not impressed by someone who comes out to play defence on second tier players for only 20 minutes a game when you have two DPOY level players sharing the court  Completely gross exaggeration. Matisse played 712 minutes this year without Ben or Joel, and Philly was still elite on that end (105 DRTG).  The hardest job in the modern NBA is guarding elite ball handlers while in drop coverage. Thybulle does that better than anyone save for Jrue Holiday, and Jrue was the deserving first team guard. Philly played a scheme that demanded elite point of attack defence, or it would have crumbled like it did last year. This year thanks to Thybulle and Ben's improvements, Philly was 2nd in defence, and as opposed to normal it wasn't Embiid doing the heavy lifting.  As I mentioned I would have had no problem with Bridges making the team, but you may want to compare the %s of how those star players shot against Bridges and against Thybulle. Thybulle absolutely destroyed some of the best scoring guards in the league (Lavine 20%, Fox 36%, Booker 27%, Beal 30%), whereas Bridges who also had an elite caliber defensive center alongside him, was simply not as effective."
"I'd say KPJ is a very promising young player, but certainly not a cornerstone yet. I'd like to see a little more production out of him this year before making that claim. As for why he's promising, he's 6'5'' with a 6'9'' wingspan and has a very quick first step with good handles. This makes him extremely dangerous attacking the rim where he has shown great finishing ability. He's also shown a lot of flashes as a playmaker, especially in the G-League where he was basically asked to run the show and he performed very well there averaging 24/7/6. He's super inconsistent in what he brings night-to-night though, and his outside shooting is pretty shaky too. BUT, when it all comes together in certain games, you really see what his ceiling could possibly be. If you want an example, look no further than this year in our win against the Bucks when he dropped 50 pts and 11 asts on Jrue Holiday. His 3 point shot was hitting and he was just unstoppable. If he gets a consistent 3 point shot (especially off the dribble), I think he has the ability to be a perennial all-star.  Bucks game: ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV1ZNT7wYn0&amp;ab\_channel=Z.Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV1ZNT7wYn0&amp;ab_channel=Z.Highlights))"
50 pts 10 ast vs Jrue Holiday. Pretty disappointing I'd say
"You just keep exposing yourself as someone that doesn’t watch basketball but thinks they do. There are multiple teams with better third options like the Bucks with Jrue Holiday, again you’re just pulling random shit out of your ass my guy and you called me the casual? Hilarious."
america's jrue holiday deserves an nba contract imo he could be a key contributor on a finals winning team
"&gt;How much do you think Lowry is worth at 35 years old demanding a 3/90 contract?   Lowry's worth is really dependent on the team. To a team like the Clippers, he has quite a bit of value. To a team like the Cavs, maybe not.   For the Sixers, I honestly thought he was an excellent value for you guys. He was no guarantee of a chip, but he absolutely would have helped increase the *odds* of winning one. Put it this way, did the Bucks or their fans honestly think Jrue Holiday would have been the difference maker to win a chip. I suspect most would say no. But they all would have agreed that Holiday was an upgrade and would have helped increase the possibility of winning one.   &gt;Joel is 27  And Embiid is injury prone. And he was having an MVP season. You and I will differ on this, I'm sure, but I dont think Embiids prime will last that long. Hence it made sense to me to go all in when the odds looked good.  &gt;we didn't need to give up the farm and ruin all of our flexibility for a fucking 35 year old literally looking for his last payday  And the funny thing about this is that, if you honestly believe that Embiid is young and has a long future ahead of you, why *not* take the risk? Lowry performs realy well and you make the ECF or Finals. With luck even win it all. He performs decently and you guys have an asset to trade. He doesn't perform at all and you buy him out or he becomes an expiring that can be traded. It was hardly a situation of messing up the salary really badly. I never got what the hesitation was."
"Why? If they wanted a good PG who's not at all on their timeline but who could help them win and mentor the young players then why did they trade Jrue Holiday? He's 5 years younger than Lowry is.   In any event, I doubt Lowry wants to go there. Some contender will almost surely get him for a similar contract to what the Pels would offer in a sign and trade. I think any noise about him signing for $25+ million in New Orleans is just leverage to get the Raptors worried they'll lose him for nothing to help facilitate a trade where he actually wants to go."
Dude dropped 50 on Jrue Holiday. That’s extraordinary I wouldn’t go as far as saying a franchise cornerstone but that’s a player to keep and develop.
AD was the second best player on his team.  Jrue Holiday was the third best player on his team.  Steven Adams will be the Grizzlies' fourth best player in a championship run???
Jrue Holiday
How is it not? Hes a part of the Jrue Holiday return and was worth two second round picks. I dont see what I'm missing here.
Helps to have Giannis and Middleton instead of Ben Simmons but yea  I do applaud the Jrue Holiday move. Despite public perception at first I thought it was a great upgrade from Eric Bledsoe and I was proven right
Right?  They'll play him like Brook Lopez and let Zion be Giannis.  The molded it after the bucks who's their new Jrue Holiday?
"We got Iran next. Anything less than 30+ is not the rest of the world catching up. Its this team playing well below its capabilities.  Also, people commenting how other players would help. Which means you want NBA all stars to help out other NBA all stars. Its embarrassing. You wanted 1A and got 1B...If Steph is 10X better than Frances PG than Dame is 8x better...29 all star games combined  Lack of depth or skill doesent exist if the 8th best player on the team (Jrue Holiday) played the best against France. Bucks were NBA world champions and they sent two guys to the Olympics and Jrue isnt even considered to be the better player.  this team lacks SERIOUS motivation and competitiveness....The quote where Ewing talks about practice is everything they were about and everything this team is not about."
Jrue Holiday
Exactly. Bucks gave a haul for Jrue Holiday because sometimes you have to overpay for a really good point guard
TIL Jrue Holiday and I are the same height. He just has 60 lbs. on me lol.
How you gonna have KD and Dame starting yet have Jrue Holiday lead your team in scoring off the bench? In what world does Jrue Holiday outshoot and outscore Kevin Durant?
I don’t know about any of that. Seems like all of what you’re saying is just pure speculation. I don’t even think Doc “threw Ben under the bus” if you watched his whole press conference either. People act like the only critical thing Doc said in the entire post game was “I don’t know if Ben can be the starting PG on a championship team” and even that isn’t exactly as bad as people make it out to be since Ben should probably always have had another primary ball handler on the fooor with him since his half court offense is so bad. A Jrue Holiday to the Bucks like move is probably the best move for the Sixers. Slide Ben to the 3 and allow him to run the in transition but have a more modern PG initiate in the half court.
Jrue Holiday. Ayton is super overrated.
Yeah and Curry and Derozan and Jrue Holiday
"Jimmy Butler, and Jrue Holiday.  Holiday would be a really good co-star."
"Giannis is a good one.  I feel like Jimmy Butler, or Jrue Holiday form a great pairing."
Donovan mitchell is not a point guard. LeBron isn't truly a point guard either. Jrue Holiday is not a point guard. Simmons is not a point guard. Westbrook is better than Morant and Fox. So no there is not 10 better point guards.
Jrue 'No' Holiday
"Not really, Giannis had Kris Middleton and Jrue Holiday… Luka had tall lanky boi"
You are a mavs fan so I trust you. My other point was the bucks roster construction around Giannis is not good even though they won a chip. Jrue holiday would be better around Luka than giannis while Giannis would prefer a more reliable shooter and worse defender
"More times than the amount of points that Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Zach LaVine and Jrue Holiday combined for today (47)."
"Because khris middleton and jrue holiday were trash for half the series. No one on the bucks was really helping Giannis consistently, KD had games where blake griffin, Jeff Green, bruce brown stepped up on top of having 2 games of healthy kyrie. Khris and jrue were hit or miss all playoffs."
"I only ever interacted with one, and it was Jrue Holiday and his wife Lauren on several occasions as I served them at a restaurant, and they were unbelievably humble and wholesome. Like, you'd have absolutely never known who they were if you didn't know who they were. Just a kinda tall dude out to eat with his wife."
I know pops made some questionable decisions here and there but it's not his fault JRUE HOLIDAY looked the most energetic on the floor.
"Are we watching the sequence of events? Jrue Holiday had an open corner 3, but he also had a completely open path to the basket along the baseline, one French defender was laying on the floor, Batum was underneath the basket, Levine was behind him on the other side. If Holiday drove that and Batum doesn't step up it's a lay up or dunk for Holiday. If Batum steps up it's a baseline bounce pass to Levine for a lay up or dunk. Or Batum or the help defender fouls either Holiday or Levine, who are both good FT shooters."
"It is hilarious that Jrue Holiday is both absolutely ideal for the current Sixers, and was one of the first players shipped out of town in The Process."
"Jaylen Brown occasionally, Jrue holiday  You have to have a solid base and quick feet, it seems tough to time"
IDK. I think 1 year of Beal is probably closer to 1 year of Jrue Holiday or Kawhi Leonard than 2 years of James Harden.
"It’s funny hearing the 3x3 guys talk so much shit on the NBA players. If some NBA guys, especially stars, went after this, they would destroy this event.  You could have a team with Curry, Harden, and KD and just put the other team on skates the entire game and end the game quickly with the 2npoint threes.   You could do a team with Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo and just steal the ball from these bums every possession. Hell, even the offensive Steph/Harden/KD team might steal the ball every possession."
"&gt; because Boston can't give anything else remotely good.  They can still do their version of the the Jrue Holiday trade right?   **Wizards:** ""Which draft picks are available?""  **Stevens:** ""Yes."""
"I hate this attitude.    &gt; ""We could've very easily got to the last game ... and Devin Booker saying, 'Man, we lost, I'm pissed off, I'm out,' or Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday saying, 'We just won a championship, I want to celebrate and stay home with my family, I'm out,'"" Green said.  No, you don't easily do that and anyone who does should be criticized for it.  You shouldn't have a lot of respect for people doing what they're supposed to do.  Committing to your word is a basic principle one should have."
"Don’t like the Shai and Cade comp. Shai is significantly better as a ball handler but Cade is stronger and a better defender. Shai is more of a Kyrie type player whereas Cade is like Tatum or a less athletic PG13 but with somewhat better playmaking.  Green and LaVine is pretty solid.  Mobley and Bosh is a bit optimistic for Mobleys offense but not bad.  Suggs is super athletic, he’s more of a Jrue Holiday IMO.  Moody and Mikal is fine but pretty optimistic  Kuminga’s ceiling comp is more of a Jaylen Brown. Less optimistically, I guess Kelly Oubre. Floor is maybe more explosive Stanley Johnson.  Bouk is more of a Jordan Clarkson or Raptors Demar Derozan, an athletic scoring guard.  Davion and Jrue is fine. Realistically he’s a more athletic Pat Bev though.  Wagner-Ariza is ok I guess.  Scottie is much more of a big than OG, and OG, while a solid passer, doesn’t playmake like Scottie. I’d say he’s more like Draymond at the very high end, Rondae Hollis Jefferson on the low end."
Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine (Jalen Green in the future that dude is cute as fuck)  Matisse Thybulle  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Serge Ibaka  Best defense in the league.. I'll take Kyrie off the bench for some insta offense he p cute
"Holy shit! Jrue Holiday is married to Lauren Holiday!? Wow I can't believe I never put that together. She is a baller, I saw her play live as a Boston breaker like 10 years back. That's awesome, thank you for the TIL."
"He had zero in game 1. Maybe it had more to do with Jrue clamping him up. In games 5 and 6 when Jrue was on Booker he went back down to 1 and 3 respectively. Direct correlation to when Jrue Holiday is on Chris Paul and CP3 struggling and vice versa  Also Saric was not as big of a loss as Divincenzo. Ayton got into foul trouble cause like all of the Suns players, he just couldn't guard Giannis"
"This isn’t happening, but if you idiots don’t think Beal is worth more than Jrue Holiday then you’re idiots"
"If the Celtics offer a Jrue Holiday-like package of picks, Washington might do it even without Jaylen."
So you're saying Jrue Holiday boutta have gray hair soon?
"A 6'4 Kyle Lowry type of player would be amazing. Now that I think about, a 6'4 Kyle Lowry is sorta like Jrue Holiday"
"Is Lauren Holiday actually better at Soccer than Jrue is at Basketball? I don't think of her as having been an elite player. Though neither is Jrue, I would have put them at around the same level in their respective sports, not had her as more skilled.  It's possible I think that only because she retired relatively early though"
I played Division 1 football. It is perfectly acceptable to compare athletes to the people they compete against.  Lauren Holiday was more dominant in her sport than Jrue is in his.   Saying that you can't say that is like saying that I can't say Wayne Gretzky was more dominant than Jrue Holiday.  Play sports above a high school level and you might understand you condescending fuck.
&gt;quite literally said jrue holiday is not a reliable shooter.  Because he isn't. He was inconsistent all playoffs.
"The only ""stat"" he provided was a hyperbole on the 25% on layups, and he quite literally said jrue holiday is not a reliable shooter. If jrue holiday was not a reliable shooter, like eric bledsoe then they never would have had made it out the ECF because that allows defenses to just  clog the paint and make life harder for Middleton and Giannis. But because jrue holiday is a reliable shooter when open, they cannot. Hence me saying that jrue holiday is a reliable shooter. If he said jrue holiday wasnt a reliable &amp; consistent scorer than id agree because he wasnt finishing a lot of good looks that he normally does in the regular season"
Brandon Jennings is younger than Jrue Holiday
"Dont let social media make you think jrue holiday was a bum lol. Eric Bledsoe would miss wide open corner 3s but holiday makes them consistently enough that teams have to respect it, and always have a man on him"
I'm not saying he deosn't deserve the recognition it's just that literally everyone was over looking him until this last playoffs sane with Jrue Holiday.
"i mean i agree AD is better but that's pretty irrelevant lol, dame has improved drastically since then. plus jrue holiday and nikola mirotic played like all-nba players so that helped"
"We run it back as much as possible and hope we play better (looking right at Jrue Holiday’s scoring). We shot 32% from three in this run, we’re not exactly replete with GOAT-tier shooting but there’s no reason that shouldn’t be minimum 35% with the guys we’ve got. It’s not a huge jump but it can make all the difference in some tight playoff games.  Aside from that, the only real need we have is another bench guard. If Forbes isn’t bombing he isn’t playing, so we only have Jrue/Pat/Donte to soak up playoff minutes there and all three of those guys are prone to extreme inconsistency offensively. I don’t really know who’s available but somebody who can pass and defend a little bit to go with some shooting is a big need.  We also have our young guys who were playing garbage time. I don’t have a lot of faith in Sam Merrill to turn into much and I’m not super sold on Diakite even though the potential is clearly there but Jordan Nwora can absolutely be a top-tier bench chucker and could be vital on nights Middleton and Holiday aren’t scoring if he can work his way into the rotation next year.  It’s also worth keeping half an eye on Lopez too, he’s old as shit and he’s fading. Portis is definitely a worse defender but I wouldn’t be mad to see him starting (assuming he stays, which is a big if) and just utilising Giannis at centre lineups more when we need the rim protection, but another playable centre off the bench would be nice if Diakite isn’t it. That’s probably something that can wait for the trade deadline though."
"They did win a playoff series and Giannis is not playing with Jrue as his #2, thats Middleton, Holiday is his 3rd option to put that into perspective for you."
"Milwaukee added a major piece to push them over the top. There is no title without Jrue Holiday. Where is Philly going to make a splash without moving Simmons? Is Philly ever going to get a better chance then they had these past playoffs? I tend to think not, with the Bucks and Nets looming, plus the Hawks improving, with the Celtics and Heat ripe for a bounce back. Sure, they can keep Simmons and try to rehabilitate his value and move him mid season, but the Sixers aren’t the Thunder. Wasting regular season time to rehabilitate a players trade value is not what contenders do. I think the Sixers got to move him now, but I don’t think they will. Which is a shame, because I think they’re just one move away."
So you’re saying that Philly should add Jrue Holiday?
"No.  Milwaukee added Jrue Holiday and he was a HUGE difference maker.  Also, the regular season is.... the regular season.  It's different."
"You are very wrong, they got a MVP Superstar in Giannis, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are All-Stars level players, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker are excellent role players. Align with that Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes who are decent role players.  It is very difficult to make a team as deep as that. Most of the teams that have 1 or more superstars, don\`t have a bench as good and tall as Milwaukee.  And they got lucky their biggest opponent is this playoff, who was Brooklyn, 2 of their 3 best players got injured..."
"10 All-NBA teams. 3 time steal champion. 4th all time in assists. Finished top 3 MVP voting three times.  I will say though he's not getting enough criticism for his game 4 performance. His team led for nearly all of the game, and he had more turnovers than field goals which is utterly awful. And I'm tired of saying ""Jrue Holiday completely caused it"". Yes, Holiday is a great defender, but CP3 has had good games while being guarded by similarly elite defenders like Iguodala and Tony Allen. CP3 just kind of choked that game."
Ben Simmons ahead of Jrue Holiday is fucking dumb
"like if you're really taking simmons over holiday after watching these playoffs I don't know what to tell you man.  westbrook, hayward, ingram, tobias all over jrue? wtf"
"I mean professional athletes often are in a relationship with other athletes. Sue Bird is with Megan Rapinoe, Jrue Holiday is with Lauren Holiday, David Lee is with Caroline Wozniacki, J.J Watt's girlfriend? Is a pro soccer player, Mia Hamm is married to Nomar Garciaparra, and I'm sure there are countless others."
"I hate the “Trade Ben for CJ” takes because they never address how the Sixers would get a competent PG on the roster. Say what you want about Ben, but the Sixers have absolutely nobody else on the roster capable of handling the ball — the Bubble sweep by Boston showed that the roster construction is, has been, and always will be a problem. We only have one true ball handler on the roster in Be.Ben has always needed another ball handler beside him and every FO we’ve had in place has failed to recognize that.   A Jrue Holiday to the Bucks move with Ben pushing the transition offense and sliding over to more of a cutting/screening wing role in half court sets with that second ball handler taking over the offense would be the Sixers best move."
"...Jrue Holiday made opposing PGs life hell on defense this season, what? Giannis just kept doing what he did, he got help he didn't have before in Holiday and that was the difference IMO."
Jrue Holiday.
"I feel like Jrue Holiday would apply. He is not a bad scorer like some of the ones listed, but he is great at everything else."
"The Bucks recovered with the Pelicans trade. If Holiday isn't on the team, the Bucks lose, and likely lose to the Nets before this.   MIL knew they made a mistake by choosing Bledsoe, and shipped him away along with the many picks needed to move him.   Regardless, MIL would have traded him to get Jrue, but wouldn't have needed to include as many picks."
"&gt;Jrue holiday went for like 5 picks. This shit is so random at this point  Jrue was a 30 year old expiring who was a good player but not a franchise altering one like Beal or Dame. you can't compare.  &gt;James harden went for a bag of balls, a washing machine and Levert.   the Nets literally leveraged 7 years of draft assets and most of their team for Harden, that trade is a TBD."
"James harden went for a bag of balls, a washing machine and Levert. Jrue holiday went for like 5 picks.   This shit is so random at this point"
I actually think he’s closer to a jrue holiday in terms of ceiling but wade def isn’t a bad comp either similar body types and both elite athletes
Jalen Suggs: Jrue Holiday  Kumimga: Jaylen Brown  But others look alright.
"Oh definitely. Lonzo can be an amazing defender. I'm just saying speculating to to be a ""Jrue Holiday-esque player"" means mainly a defensive player, and it's unfair to expect Lonzo to be as good as Jrue, who's the best perimeter defender in the league."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
Giannis would be able to win playoff series with Jrue Holiday. AD ain't that guy.
Kyle Lowry will be the Jrue Holiday replacement
"Zach LaVine is 26, with 7 years experience in the league. Do we still consider him a younger guy? He's younger than KD, sure, but so is Jrue Holiday."
Jrue Holiday would be a nice fit if Lowry doesn’t pan out
"They need a PG, maybe someone like Jrue Holiday…?"
"I know this sub doesn't like Lonzo but if he has the work ethic then he could take the leap and become a Jrue Holiday-esque player. he's already known for his defense, he just needs to be a lot more consistent on offense."
"AD had to play the warriors with Jrue Holiday as his second best player.  Not saying he's better than Giannis just that you've all forgotten just how good Davis is because he's been hurt, thats recency bias."
Jrue Holiday as his second option not third
Every team needs a Jrue Holiday bro lol but yea I get your point. if we're talking about players that could develop into someone then I wish Lonzo would be a Jrue lite lol
Except too bad they traded Jrue holiday because that’s who they need
This is the impact of Jrue Holiday! The trade was 100% worth it
Jrue  Holiday
Played a hell of a lot better than Jrue Holiday I bet (would have to go and check the numbers but I mean yeah he was great)
Why the fuck would that matter if he didn't play like that for the Cavs in 2016? Plus he got injured in that series and missed a game.  I guess the Bucks were a superteam. You never saw Jrue Holiday on the Pelicans/Sixers. You must be new to the NBA.
Jrue Holiday shat on Dame in the 2018 playoffs. Does that make him better?
My respect for Jrue Holiday launched to next level when he single-handedly shut down Damian Lillard in that first round pelicans-blazers sweep
Jrue Holiday really has straps. Bucks defense shut it down in Games 5 and 6
Shout-out to the Jrue Crew!  &gt; It's between Jrue Holiday... and Khris Middleton.
"Common use of the term superteam is 3 stars. Some people have your definition yea but your definition is weak and easily proven as dumb and inconsistent. Only weird control freaks think a superteam is a team that players organize, because they have some sick view of players as mindless chess pieces and think only GMs should control them otherwise it's a ""superteam"".  Tell me, were the 2017 Knicks a superteam? Derrick Rose said so. He colluded with Melo and Porzingis to team up.   What about the Bucks? Jrue Holiday demanded a trade. Giannis recruited him. Tsk tsk. Superteam!"
You can't expect Anthony Davis to win with players like *checks notes* Jrue Holiday.
"No, you just have a bullshit definition of superteam. You're saying if a team drafts Kawhi, Steph, and Lebron it's not a superteam just because they drafted them? BULLSHIT.  &gt;A team formed overnight by free agency or players demanding trades.  Tell me how the Bucks got Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, and Robin Lopez. You know, their entire rotation."
"Anyone in here posting stats saying Dirk's career and 2011 playoff run is dwarfed by what Giannis just did are individuals who didn't watch basketball in 2011. The Mavs had just about the toughest road of ANY team in nba history that year. While they had step up performances to get through it they did not have Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday level players, period.   Giannis had an incredible performance but it was not better than post prime Dirk beating the healthy Lakers, Heat and Blazers. On par sure because what he did this post-season was remarkable but to put it clearly above Dirk is recency bias newphewesque garbage. 🤡"
Holiday brothers are actually snipers (minus Jrue) so I’ma take them
How do you minimize having curry and klay as teammates.  Just the gravity of these two gave Durant space to get off shots.  Jrue holiday had 2 games in the finals where he shot 4-19 and 4-20 and then pj tucker was off hiding in a corner.  The suns were defending 5 on 3 most of the series
"Yea, they got Jrue Holiday.... Nice try."
" Because his team didn't start with Khris Middleton, an outside shooter who can also create his own shot.  Because his team didn't get Brook Lopez for free, and turn him into an elite stretch 5.  Because his team didn't get a solid contributor in Pat Connaughton for free.  And thats before they became a KD shoe size away from brutally overpaying for PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday."
Jrue holiday is who Patrick Beverley thinks he is
"We don’t even have a 1st round pick this year, traded it for RoCo last year. The only route for the team to contend is to trade CJ for basically nothing in return (maybe a single 1st rounder in return, the most important part ), and then do a Bucks “sell the farm” trade in the mold of Jrue Holiday. The issue is that Dame, while an all-NBA talent, probably can’t draw the type of superstar to Portland needed to elevate the blazers"
"Take Jrue and Kris Middleton off the team.  Do the Bucks still win?  If you have more than a 1% uncertainty about it, then you can’t say Giannis’ performance was better.  Jason Terry was the second best player on the team.  Caron Butler was the third.  None of them were close to Middleton or Holiday.  Dirk’s 2011 and 2006 runs were the biggest carry jobs in the history of the league.  Giannis is up there.  But a step above?  No way."
"You’re right about one thing, it was 3 finals not 4. Where are you getting this 26/13 against the east?  For the playoffs,  In 2015 against the Celtics he put up 14/7.   In 2016, 15/9 on 54%TS. 9/7 in the finals.   In 2017, 17/11 on 60%TS. 16/11 on 39/39/80 splits   And 2018, 15/10 on 51%TS. 19/11 on 41/32/94 splits.   This doesn’t even account for his awful defense.   For comparison, Jrue Holiday as a third option just put up 17/6/9 with elite defense in these playoffs."
Jrue Holiday without the defense that’s tuff 💪
"Jrue Holiday tries to hold the Larry O’Brien and spots a sweat stain on the trophy: ""Somebody holding this before me?""  Reporters: ""P.J. Tucker.""  Jrue: ""That makes sense.""   Reporters: ""Sweaty?""  Jrue: ""Yes. Extremely."""
"He didn't need to do Dirk like that lol. Man gave 20 years to Dallas and chipped in one of the hardest title runs in recent memory. No other All-Stars... no Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday type guys on that roster either. If anything, isn't that more impressive to beat Lebron, Wade, and Bosh?"
Theo Pinson was obviously the key to the Knicks finishing fourth this season. Frank Ntilikina is better than Jrue Holiday. RJ is basically MJ. Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox are both better than Kevin Durant. Mitchell Robinson is basically Wilt.
Jrue Holiday specializes in arrive to fix doomed teams
Kobe and Bynum. The Jrue Holiday the Bucks got from the pelicans? Right?
"The 2011-12 team would have had an incredible future. Jrue, Lou, Young and Iggy, plus they had just drafted Vucevic. Looking back now we can say that would have been a very competitive team for years. They built a great team without tanking and ruined it all with the terrible Bynum trade.   Which of these two teams would you like to have?  *2012 Sixers*  Jrue Holiday (21)  Andre Iguodala (28)  Lou Williams (25)  Thad Young (23)  Nikola Vucevic (21)   *2021 Sixers*  Joel Embiid (26)  Ben Simmons (24)  Tobias Harris (28)  Seth Curry (30)  Danny Green (33)  Embiid is by far the best player out of both teams, but that 2012 team is super good and so young, and didn't cost 3 years of intentional tanking."
"Hot take:  The Pelicans will become the Bucks 2.0.   1. Hire a good coach, one that can raise their floor to a top 3 seed. Idk who’s available. Maybe they can get Brett Brown and hope that he replicates the success he had with the Sixers (second round ceiling).  2. Zion will become Giannis lite, with better shooting and worse defense. Average of 28/7/5. Will have an MVP campaign, and the media will hype him so much it’s basically a lock.  3. Ingram will be Middleton lite. If he becomes a closer next season (he’s already an all star, I think he’s capable), then Zion’s got his Robin.  4. If they resign lonzo (hopefully to a team friendly deal, despite what he wants), they got their Jrue Holiday lite. Defensive guard, with a bit of playmaking and a bit of scoring.  5. Ship Bledsoe. They have to stick to a Lonzo/NAW backcourt, and Bledsoe doesn’t fit their timeline. If he’s not willing to be the team’s vet leader, then ship him.  6. Adams hopefully develops a 3 and shoots at a decent rate (35% on 3-4a/g should be good, but this is just wishful thinking). I think it’s impossible tho, but when you’re paying him that much money you better ask him to do shit for you."
"It shouldn’t be. After 2011, Wade didn’t have a single finals where he averaged more PPG than Middleton put up against the Suns. Jrue Holiday put up more than Chris Bosh against the Thunder or the Spurs either time. And both played better defense than Bosh or Wade. Wade is my favorite player of all time, and it was *hard* to watch the decline post-2011. I love Chris Bosh, and would take him over K Love 10 times out of 10, but I don’t see how K Love isn’t classified as a super team 3rd option if Bosh is. Multiple all stars, never really did much in the playoffs before joining Lebron, etc…. OP’s very specific definition of a “super team” is… weird."
When booker dropped 40 holiday was on cp3 both games. When jrue was on booker he wasn't nearly as good.
"Just being in Milwaukee is a blessing from god""- Jrue Holiday  Said noone ever prior to 2018.  Love to see it."
Okay and if jrue holiday had hit a free throw seconds before that shot the bucks would’ve been up 4. But he didn’t; and Kd didn’t hit a three and my uncle isn’t my grandma
"You forgot about drafting Mbah a Moute in 08', trading him to SAC in 13'-14' for the 36th pick in 16' and using it to draft Brogdon, then sign and trading him to the Pacers in 19'-20' for the 24th pick in the 20' draft, and then using it as part of the Jrue Holiday trade."
"An inorganic collection of superstar Talent, I'd say three Superstars or two top fiveish players combined with another perennial All-Star       Like I don't consider Duncan, Ginobili and Parker to be a super team, that's just damn good drafting    I don't know what the hell Stephen Jackson was thinking saying that Milwaukee of Greek Freak, Chris Middleton and Jrue Holiday wasn't superintendent      The Nets were not a super team until they added James Harden     The Golden State Warriors were not a super team, until they added Kevin Durant       I don't consider the late 90s Bulls to be a super team, now people might push back on that I will say they were a super team from a defensive standpoint, but Rodman just wasn't going to give you anything offensively and it was looked at as a super risky move at the time but if you want to call it 1, I'm not going to have a huge monster debate with you          And I would not consider the 2020 bubble Lakers a super team now if they had Westbrook or Damian Lillard or whoever the hell they're planning on adding this year, then yes that elevates them to super team status"
"If I was an opponent I would not consider Jrue Holiday a floor spacer in like 75 percent of the games he shot terribly.   His top asset by far is defense but he is also aging so can we really expect his lockdown ability to continue?  A trade for Simmons would be all upside. You know you are getting great defense that won't be lost with aging, and there is still a chance he learns to shoot better and you have now unlocked a superstar.   I think if you ask any GM in NBA if they want Jrue Holiday or Ben Simmons it's a very tough call. But if someone wants to take a homerun swing you go with Ben. And the Bucks just won the title so why not take a big swing. If you miss oh well at least you got your ring.    If you swing and connect holy shit. now you might be talking something crazy like 4 rings like Spurs territory."
Please. Jrue Holiday in the Finals average 17.5/6.2/9.3 and had the highest plus/Minus with 37 out of anyone.  It was a huge part of Milwaukee winning against the Suns. There Is no narrative between Simmons over Jrue for Milwaukee. He just fits way way better than Simmons. His playmaking ability in the Finals are so underated. He average the most assist out of anyone between the Suns and Bucks.
"They need to bring back PJ Tucker   He shut down Durant in a few games in that series in games 3 and 4.   If the Nets win either of those games the Bucks don't win the chip.   They also need to think about dealing Jrue Holiday for Ben Simmons. As amazing as Jrue was in this series Ben Simmons is ever MORE of a lockdown defender and they don't need offense in that spot.   Giannis can get fed and the shooting can come from Patty C, Donte and Middleton can run point.   Middleton \[PG}  Donte \[SG\]   Simmons \[Roamer/Defender/Draymond role\]  Giannis \[Shaq 2.0 monster\]  Brook Lopez \[C\]  Patty C \[6th man\]  Portis \[backup big\]  PJ TUCKER \[ Durant stopper only play him big minutes against Nets\]"
"Super Team is any 3 legit all stars \[to be legit you must be multi time all star\]   Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez were both 1 time all stars so they are not legit all stars.   Middleton is a legit all star player.   Giannis/Middleton/CP3 would have been a superteam.   &amp;#x200B;  Brooklyn was only Superteam this year.   If Lakers can add Westbrook, CP3 or Lowry they will become a Superteam too"
What’s crazy about this is that Jrue holiday underperformed on the offensive end a lot if he can replicate his regular season numbers more while playing that defence I wouldn’t write them off but it is hard to see people beating the Nets without injuries. In the regular season Jrue shot over 50% from the field and 39% from 3 in the playoffs he barely shot 40% from the field and 30% from 3 but his assists did go up.
He said today that Giannis is disrespecting his teammates by saying he didn’t join a super team. He also said the Bucks are a super team. He said everyone in the league talks good about Jrue Holiday so that makes him a superstar lol. Dude sounded genuinely pissed off the Bucks won
"Superteam is the same way a musical supergroup is formed—established artists or members from huge bands join each other knowing they're already great performers to form a ""supergroup"" that already has a heightened status. Khris Middleton and Giannis are both solid players, but they didn't join the Bucks with that status being known. They developed into this. It's also worth mentioning that Giannis is the only real superstar on the Bucks. It's not like three superstar players from different teams coming together. I think superteams are usually considered when like a superstar player joins an established powerful team shown to be already capable of winning the playoffs. So that's why even though Jrue Holiday is a key piece to the Bucks championship roster (who previously met trouble and meltdowns in the playoffs) and he only was traded to them this year, he's not really like that superstar caliber, just a really beautiful find for their rotation and the exact piece they needed to take them over the top. Lmao i just kept typing sorry for the essay"
"That Cavs team had Lebron coming back to Cleveland to play with Kyrie, a prolific scorer and multiple time all star and Kevin Love, who people considered to be a great PF because of his Minnesota endeavors.   The Bucks had Giannis, who people didn't respect because of his previous playoff failures, Middleton, who is wildly inconsistent, and Jrue Holiday, who people just considered to be an upgrade to Bledsoe. A lot of people also considered the Nets to win the East. These teams are wildly different."
"Only Bucks fans are not in favor of the 2019 Raptors.  If I use your logic, you were about to get swept if not for injuries this year..   Bucks 2019 were still top tier team. Brogdon was borderline All STAR, Lopez was becomijg the splash Mountain and Bledsoe had his Last good year. Jrue Holiday alone isn't equal to that"
"The opposite of this is teams like the Cavs when lebron was young, the pelicans with AD, etc who simply didn't want to spend the money or couldn't acquire good enough talent to give them chances to win. But in this situation, the bucks were 100% amazing in their ability to build a team from nothing to champion. Taking a chance on a raw athlete who didn't start playing basketball till he was 12, trade Brandon Jennings for a 2nd rounder who was in the g league and the pistons thought wasn't good enough, sit back and let them develop, make smart moves like signing Brook Lopez, drafting donte divencenzo, signing pat connaughton, trading for pj tucker, going all in and trading away 3 frp and Eric bledsoe for jrue holiday. They did it well and did it right, something alot of owners aren't willing to dig into to get that chip"
"Trading one for Asik is really the only one I had a problem with. He probably could have gotten him for a couple of seconds considering Houston had Dwight Howard. The other first round trades were for Jrue Holiday, Cousins, and Mirotic, and aside from Cousins's Achilles injury happening, all three would happen again."
Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton for Lillard and CJ
"There’s more offense with the Ball Brothers, while the Holiday brothers (well at least Jrue and Justin) would bring more defense.   I’ll go with the ball brothers."
"Well it's Jrue Holiday compared to JJ Reddick.  What has the latter done for the team compared to Holiday?  NOP did Holiday right for sure because hes really earned it from the team.  Reddick, though, hasn't done anything for the team so the connection just wasn't there at all so they were a bit less inclined to '""do him right""."
Was jrue holiday the difference in damn near getting swept in second round to nba champions? See how stupid you sound teams change every year last years results get thrown out the window every new season. Heat had some of the worst covid luck last season and everyone was fatigued from short turn around
"He didn't say that though? He said that Net Rating specifically doesn't tell anything about Simmons individual play.  Take Embiid off the floor and its obvious that the Sixers will be worse, he is one of the best players in the game, but for Simmons individually he scores more while being more efficient and having no drop in his assists numbers.  They don't fit, Embiid needs a point guard that can shoot and distribute (a Jrue Holiday or Mike Conley type) while Simmons needs a stretch 5 that will give him space to work in the paint (a Kevin Love or Vucevic)."
"It’s fine bro. You obviously just have an irrational hate for Luka. As if he didn’t drop 42/8/14 in a close game 5 where there was no “stat padding.” Zubac also only played 2 minutes game 7 when Luka put up 46/7/14. Who was he scoring on then? Or as if the 2020 playoffs didn’t happen where he got the switch on Reggie Jackson and hit the buzzer beater. You keep pretending like Luka scored 0 on Kawhi or some shit.  Meanwhile, let’s see Dames good series in the last few years. Denver 2021 no good guard defenders, he plays well. Lakers 2020 have good defense, he plays poorly. 2019 GSW plays a good defensive team, plays poorly. Did meh against Denver 2019 because they had Gary Harris back then who was good on defense. He was atrocious 2018 playoffs with Jrue Holiday. Maybe Dame is the one u need to worry about being exposed. Because Luka has played a good defensive team twice in the playoffs without any reliable offensive help. I know dame don’t got the best squad around him either, but he definitely has some offensive talent.   Anyways, we will see how this season goes. I do hope the defensive improvements the team made help Dame and Portland as a team out. But the fact u only tried to bring Luka down and not counter with anything about Dame and how good he is (because I know he is a top 10 guy) just screams that u are a hater of a player."
"Jrue Holiday…he’s known for being a lockdown defender but he’s a consistent 17ppg - 19ppg scorer, can facilitate very well and is a solid rebounder. It’s criminal that this man has made only one all star team. His value was truly shown during the Bucks final run though."
outplayed in the clutch?  Did you watch the series... KD carried the Nets to a game 7 despite not having KD and only have like 25% of Harden.  How do you think the series would have went if the Nets were fully healthy and the Bucks were missing Jrue Holiday / Middleton was playing badly injured?
"&gt; And getting Saric and Noel for Jrue Holiday was not a great use of the assets Hinkie inherited.  They got Noel and Elfrid Payton. Payton got swapped for 3 picks(Saric, Shamet, Willy Hernangomez)"
Jrue holiday and teams being hurt
"I think the Heat struggled to replicate it because their entire squad was trying to deal with injuries.  That postseason run took a lot out of them and the turnaround was too short.  Same with the Lakers.  The Suns were dogshit the year before and didn't make the playoffs.  They were, therefore, completely healthy because they are young and had more rest time, apart from CP3 (who proved my point by getting injured).  Murray had a short bubble turnaround and got hurt, Harden, the list goes on.  Even the Bucks, who were in the playoffs the year before, had great performances out of Jrue Holiday (who was not in the playoffs the year before) and an injured Giannis.  Basically overworking players in the bubble with not enough of an offseason completely fucked everyone over injury wise.  I agree with you and I'm not trying to assume anything.  I do think that the teams that were freshest had disproportionate success, and I won't say further than that.  My only point was that durability is maybe the most important NBA skill."
"[Here is your elite defense getting cooked on every PnR by Trae and had you guys get sent home.](https://youtu.be/hfueWbkNMV8)   Ben is definitely overrated, he is not a top 5 defender on the league. He is not even the best defender on the 6ers, I'd easily take Embiid and Thybulle over him. [Here is Jrue Holiday defending Trae the very next series and he is way more successful at fighting through the screens](https://youtu.be/BT7lWQSegO0), compared to Ben who literally gives up or half asses on half of them"
"I meant to say the type of defense Giannis plays isn't as impactful as the type Rudy Gobert plays or the type Jrue Holiday plays. Plus they had one of the luckiest runs ever to win a championship. Still, the gap in defense doesn't make up for Luka being nuclear on offense."
"The irony of the process starting with trading away Jrue Holiday, when Jrue Holiday would be a perfect fit with their squad."
"Jrue Holiday, not playing in the bubble, Giannis not being injured."
And they started the teardown from a team featuring a young Jrue Holiday and Thad Young who were decent assets in their own right.
"That's not an ""insane"" collection of assets. It's basically Embiid, the Simmons pick, the Kings pick (turned out to be 14) and pick swap, Saric, Covington, and two late first rounders (OKC and Miami picks).  The other guys took years and multiple teams to develop, were not good, and/or were redundant.   And getting Saric and Noel for Jrue Holiday was not a great use of the assets Hinkie inherited."
Jrue Holiday. Giannis is Ari and Jabari Parker is Sang Woo
"All three of the most recent champions were built through trades. Bucks traded a ton of picks for Jrue Holiday, Lakers traded the roster for Anthony Davis, and Raptors traded for Kawhi..."
Jrue holiday is not the difference Eric Bledsoe can do everything he does
Presti is not doing it at a larger scale       Presti started by getting a ton of picks for Paul George and Russell Westbrook       Hinkie started by getting 2 picks for Jrue Holiday. Sixers started with literally no assets. Thunder came out the gate with 7 FRPs and more swaps
Jrue Holiday
"Jrue Holiday's impact that series was huge, he was arguably most valuable Buck for the Heat series.  His addition most swung Bucks fortunes that series.  And Middleton was more efficient in 2021 with Jrue allowing him to be off-ball a bit more.  Brook also outplayed Bam in 2021, that matchup favored Heat a bit in 2020.  Think Brook was in better shape, healthier back in 2021 playoffs despite being worse in the 2021 regular season.  Heat also got worse with loss of Crowder and Olynyk.  Heat limited Giannis's ability to score efficiently in both series, but I think he was able to be more patient as a playmaker in 2021 cause of how Bucks made some adjustments on offense and got better play from Middleton and Holiday.  And Giannis defended Jimmy Butler more in 2021 and the Bucks really limited him as a scorer more.  Butler and Bam were much less effective in 2021 than 2020.  Dragic still scored fine in 2021, but got fewer assists, his teammates weren't getting open as much and loss of Crowder took away some shooting."
"A lot of it didn’t have anything to do with the Bucks in particular (besides the Bucks having more talent of course). Butler got injured right before the playoffs and missed the end of the regular season. The Heat weren’t as good of a team as the previous year and were being hard carried by Jimmy and Bam, so if either of those guys ended up getting neutralized, the team was ready for total collapse.  The biggest thing the Bucks had was Jrue Holiday and Budenholzer growing a brain. Putting Giannis on Butler and then making every switch into Holiday on Butler pretty much guaranteed Butler wasn’t going to go off with his injury. Once that happened, it became imperative for Bam to take over the series, and he was too passive in the series to do that, and without either Butler or Bam carrying the team, Dragic tried, but never fully recovered from his final injury and the role players (besides D-Rob) were Doo Doo all year and a total collapse happened."
Jrue Holiday
"How? Marc gasol is way too slow to stop javale and AD. Lebron and kawhi basically cancel each other  out. The lakers didn't have a series past 5 games until the finals, the raptors beat the 76ers by the skin of their teeth off a shot that had the luckiest bounce in nba history  The 2021 bucks would destroy the 2019 raptors, Bledsoe was the weak link. With jrue holiday the raptors simply can't stop them on D nor could they have anyone score on Giannis"
"Nah, absolutely not, no. They had Giannis who is the most dominant finisher in the last 15 years, Jrue Holiday arguably the best 3&amp;D guard in the NBA, Khris Middleton who is arguably one of the best all around wings in the NBA, and a supporting cast of extremely solid role players like Bobby Portis and PJ Tucker. This is just incorrect."
"Gobert:   * Unfair: he can't guard the perimeter. No, he's not gonna hang on Kyrie like he's Jrue Holiday. But there have been plenty of times where he rotates out to the perimeter and contests a shot- he contested 3.8 three pointers per game last year, seventh among consistent starters at center. He's sixth among starters in three-point percentage allowed, despite contesting more threes than all but one player (Chris Boucher) above him. And half the point of having Gobert to to make guys shoot from the perimeter; on average in 2020/2021, teams made 64.23% of their shots at the rim, compared to 36.7% from three. Percentage-wise, you want a giant guy in the middle forcing teams to take outside shots.   * Fair: his offense is an issue in the playoffs. He's a high-efficiency and super strong, but he basically can only score from dunks, and isn't absolutely elite at powering to the rim in the way of Giannis. Defenses can shut him down too easily in the playoffs, you really need someone who can score multiple different ways (Jokic, AD, Embiid) or is absolutely elite at scoring at the rim (Giannis). Gobert is only average, so teams will either throw a guy in the paint to force him into more difficult looks or let him get his easy looks but focus on locking down the Jazz's shooters. Then there's the hack-a-Rudy issue, which, while never as bad as Ben, is a concern."
You don't actually believe that E'Twaun Moore was at any point even remotely comparable to Jrue Holiday do you?
Fred van fleet  Jrue holiday   Mikal Bridges  Ben Simmons  Myles Turner
"Jrue Holiday, C.J. McCollum, Khris Middleton, Simmons, Porzingis"
"We agree to disagree.   For me the process is simply dumb, the 76ers didn't built a winning environment which should have the right thing to do. Instead they drafted consistently in the top 10 (sometimes even multiple times) and they are a complete mess. And that's not because of Harford or other singing. Proof is they always had lacked a guard who can score and defend, they simply had it in Jrue Holiday and traded him to start this whole process shit. 9 years later they still miss a player like that.  Among all the picks only Embiid is sticking with them.  I think it is also statistically ineffective as a strategy. The Kings, the Cavs without LBJ, the TWolves. All apply in a way or the other the process way, never escaping it even when they pick good players."
"Ryan Hollins: “Giannis in 2021 is the same Giannis he was in 2020 and 2019. In fact, he might have gotten worse! Last year he was the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, and he got NONE of that [this year]. He’s the SAME player. You know what he’s got? And he better thank his lucky stars. Instead of you [talking to Chris Broussard] riding Giannis’ coattail you need to be talking about Jrue Holiday. It’s the same Giannis as 2019, it’s the same dude!... You know who you should be crediting? The coaching staff! ‘The last two years “Giannis Ball” hasn’t worked, why don’t you pass the ball to Jrue Holiday? Why don’t you get Middleton involved?’” "
"I think we are already but to really push the envelope, Someone just a bit better than barton. Jrue holiday or jalylen brown definitely but even mikal bridges here would be huge"
Jrue holiday apparently
"The Pelicans had a consistently shitty defence for years regardless of where he played, and they had Jrue Holiday as well."
I didn’t say anything about an entire year…  As of this time last year Jrue Holiday wasn’t on the Bucks and Eric Bledsoe was. Not sure why everyone acts like a deal NEEDs to happen. We have time…  A large portion of the NBA isn’t even eligible to be traded due to contracts signed this summer.   Why should the Sixers make a deal now? What’s the benefit? Embiid wants a championship. His goal isn’t to go 10-0 to start the season. We were a one seed last year and the year was seen as a failure. Regular season doesn’t mean much…
"We were in a basketball tourney with the Holiday brothers (Justin and Jrue) and Campbell Hall. We were a bunch of Mexican kids, but we won our league that year. We lost in the game before playing the Holidays by 20 points. Which was good because the team We lost to, lost to Campbell Hall by 70 points. It wasn't even competitive."
Oh wow I misread this as Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday is a role player?
Jrue Holiday: ?????
Pelicans  2011: Josh Harrellson -&gt; Andrew Goudelock  2012: Anthony Davis -&gt; Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  2013: Nerlens Noel -&gt; Ben McLemore (pick was traded for Jrue Holiday)  2014: No Pick  2015: Branden Dawson -&gt; Nikola Radičević
"I personally think AD is more parallel to KG. Both are versatile defenders. Great face up and midrange game. Better 2nd options than 1st options. Both have the same build and doesn’t necessarily dominate physically. To me, Giannis reminds me of a taller Charles Barkley/Tim Duncan hybrid.  unstoppable in transition, dominates you in the post, questionable shooting excellent help defender. Also, I think Luka is more like Bird because they aren’t necessarily the best athletes but controls the game in every aspect with a sweet shooting touch.   I would like to add that Hakeem and Embiid have similar playstyles.   De’Aaron Fox = John Wall  Jrue Holiday = GP  Prime Rajon Rondo = JKidd  CJ McCollum = Monta Ellis  Before anyone downvotes me, I am not saying they are at their levels. I am just saying they have similar play styles in my eyes. Feel free to disagree."
Jrue Holiday on offense can be cringy to watch at times.
"In order to have any argument for someone being ""obviously"" better scorer to someone else, you shouldn't have close to same TS, let along the other person having slightly more. Obviously better scorer would be like comparing Damian Lillard to Jrue Holiday."
"Ok that makes sense. I wasn’t aware of how they were specifically structured, just that some of them were funny like “win championship” for Jrue Holiday and that’s what pushed them into the luxury tax this off-season. Thanks for the info."
"1. And? Guys like Josh Richardson, Jrue Holiday and Jayson Tatum were extremely affected. It affects different people differently so what’s your point ?  2. No the problem is with anti vaxxers for putting other people at risk out of sheer ignorance. Also the reason kids under 12 cant get it is due to safety... research is still being done to figure out the affects/ dosages for children. You realize vaccines have different affects on different age groups and science requires time to study right ?  3. No, cities making the choice illegal are prioritizing safety. I’m mad at the people refusing to follow that law. And again the fact is the law is in place... so it’s their choice that’s preventing them from playing and helping their team regardless of how you try to spin it.  4. My problem is with employees refusing to adhere to the rules of the business they work for. Everyone has a choice and those choices have consequences. It’s that simple. If you don’t want to get vaccinated, then don’t. But you can’t proceed to bitch about the consequences of it.  5. I have the same reaction when players do thinks that put other people at risk, like assault.  6. The same logic applies either way..."
"I think your exaggerating these things, he doesn't get bullied as often as you suggest and he hustles to get around screens and to bother ball handlers, and like I said he is actually one of the better guards in the league about taking charges, which is just as important as getting steals or forcing turnovers. Its not like I've noticed Rose do exceptionally well in these areas too, neither are good defenders so its really not a huge point in either direction. Its not like you're comparing a Jrue Holiday to a Trae Young and using defense as a talking point, you're comparing marginally different defensive players (at the least important defensive position on the court), and its one that doesn't lend itself to advanced stats or metrics very well...its a minor angle in all this.  &gt;I’m not saying he’s a bad player  You did though, you said he is almost a net negative player...thats so hyperbolic. He is still a very solid player, clearly a starting level point guard or a very top end 6th man scorer...he just wasn't worth the contract he had."
"Butler didn't have a lot of offensive help and had Giannis, PJ tucker, Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday on him at any given time. If the bucks had to worry about defending Embiid instead, I think that might change things"
"But he CAN'T guard him, that's my entire fucking point. He is not a quick defender, he cannot defend an above average point guard reliably. [Here is Jrue Holiday guarding Trae the next series, and it's so obvious how much better of a defender Jrue is](https://youtu.be/BT7lWQSegO0) - he keeps up on driving attempts, he gets caught in some screens but fights through a lot of them too, and even when he can't get through a screen, he forces Trae tight into the drop defender and takes away the pass, which is way better than Simmons who was letting Trae run free at Embiid. All that nonsense about guarding 2-4 is also stupid, because here you can see Jrue guarding Huerter, Collins and even Gallinari really well.    I don't understand how a PG who can't even defend his own position gets DPOY noise when there are better defenders at PG, let alone big men."
"Going back a bit further, here's some more  * what if the league didn't force Hinkie out early, would he have drafted Fultz * what if Coangelo wasn't put in place to destroy the Sixers process and waste most of the collected assets * what if LeBron actually chose Philly over LA, for basketball reasons * what if we didn't trade away Mikal Bridges for Zhaire who ended up being a bust * what if we re-signed Nerlens on the cheap to back-up Embiid when Klutch was ignoring our GM's inquiries (which they are now being sued over) * what if we never traded Jrue Holiday away, would he be as good as he is now * what if we didn't trade away so many assets for Bynum who never played for us, would the process have ever even happened"
real talk.  what do you think a sixer team without simmons accomplishes next year?  the way people talk rn out of rightful anger makes it seem like simmons has little impact.  and i worry its gonna be a way big issue than people realize.  people dont always easily see a defensive all star for what he is.  as a bucks fan i see other fans bashing jrue holiday all the time for his lack of scoring.  but i know how much of an impact he has without scoring.  so i wonder what will happen next year.
But Ben was better than Lowry and Jrue Holiday was... jrue holiday
"I like the confidence, but he's not quite top 5 yet.  Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday, (even) Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Jamaal Murray, Steph Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard are all better.  You could argue he is a top 10 PG. He is definitely in direct competition with the likes of De'Aaron Fox and D'Angelo Russell.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Forgot Westbrook. Yeah, Morant isn't quite top 10 yet."
"To be fair Jimmy faced crazy competition with not much offensive help. Butler had Giannis, PJ Tucker, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton on him at any given time. Bam also played incredibly small with his passiveness on offence."
"&gt;Jrue is a better defender than Ben.  He's not as switchable, doesn't close out as well and can't remotely disrupt Toronto's best player. Like he's a better option on Lowry 1 on 1, a player who rarely isos and was ass in the series anyway. Simmons is way more valuable in this series than Holiday."
"Jrue Holiday is worse on defense but he can actually hit threes. Ben did the best against Kawhi, but then again, it's Kawhi, and Jrue can offset the lost defense with far superior offense."
Jrue Holiday or Kyle Lowry would be the baseline for that I think
So the fact that Jrue Holiday guards Luka makes Jrue Holiday a small forward? I'm struggling to understand your logic.
Fox and Jrue Holiday are clearly better than Ja. Lowry probably as well
Jrue Holiday?😂🤣
"If you gave him a roster as good as the Bucks had this past season, for sure.   I mean... you take out Drew Gooden and Mo Williams and replaced them with Kris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. That's a helluva upgrade.   I mean... it's very likely the Jeff Teague is better than Mo Williams was, and he's the back up!"
"Middleton didn’t become an All-Star until 2019, 6 years after the Bucks acquired him. Jrue Holiday has been an All-Star only once, 8 years prior in 2013.   Caruso was picked up from the G league and Philly would be lucky to have any of these players if they could get past Ben Simmons."
"Fans overrate scoring. Simple as that.  Players who specialize in other areas (i.e. Draymond, B Wallace, Rodman) will never be *fully* appreciated because so much analysis is reductive to the point of ""Who scores the most points?""   You see the same thing in soccer. Ask about the best players of the past decade. People will invariably name goal scorers like Messi, Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, etc. It is very easy to understand the person whose job is to finish the chain. What's harder to value correctly is the people who toil in the support structure, like a defensive midfielder, center back, or goalie.  In basketball there are players like Ron Artest, Jae Crowder, Andre Iguodala, Tristan Thompson, Jrue Holiday (until this year), Andrew Bogut, and Tyson Chandler who just sort of fly under the radar because the things they excel at aren't the things that most impress the general public (i.e. shot making).   But to actually win basketball games, you need rebounding, passing, defense, etc. That's why you see Scottie Barnes as a top 5 pick in the draft, and the Bucks selling the farm for Jrue, who is not regarded as a great pure scorer. Teams have more of an understanding that winning isn't just about having a bunch of guys who can drop 20 every night."
"Youre forgetting Jrue Holiday, who would also probably be the second best player on those Cavs."
Same way Jrue Holiday was an All star back when he was on the Sixers. Good volume stats on a surprise team that helped gather votes. I love Jrue too but he wasn't an all star that year and DLo was even worse he's not good at all for what he gets paid
To be fair while Giannis absolutely dominated Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday were great too  So not entirely Giannis vs the world on the NBA finals   And Clippers almost got three wins against these Suns without Kawhi and Lakers without AD and partial LeBron got 2 wins over the Suns.   I'd argue Bucks were better than THAT Clippers team and THAT Lakers team.
"Sure maybe not everyone went public and said  Ben lost them the game or compared him to a nazi supporter but they were radio silent when the media and the coach was shitting on him.   Silence is almost as bad as publicly saying that. I feel like if you tried to trash a player on another team the stars and role players would be quick to speak up. Could you imagine trying to trash davis in front of lebron? He wouldn’t have it. Or what if someone tried to blame jrue holiday for a playoff loss? Bud, middleton, Giannis would not hear of it. They’d blame themselves long before they accepted their teammate lost them a game on his own"
"Given what he's valuing Simmons at now, there's simply no way he was going to give up Simmons plus Jrue Holiday-level picks and swaps plus a another player. And yet if he had, the Rockets obviously would've taken it. Tillman wasn't going to let Morey fleece him, but if Morey had paid the premium it would've happened."
"Bucks stock is still high. Maybe they dipped a smidge because of recent FUD, but they've had anywhere from 3-4 starters and a few rotation players injured or COVID out for most of the season so far. They were starting Giannis with Grayson Allen, George Hill, Bobby Portis, and now Jrue Holiday. Thanasis and Connaughton started games too, and their Scrabble bench got a bunch of minutes. It's obvious they won't play at the level of their current record but people still think there's actually a dip smh."
Middleton is a better second option than most other team's second options but name recognition has put other players like Paul George or Russell Westbrook ahead of him. Also Jrue Holiday is a better point guard than Westbrook
Trae young make dame look like jrue holiday
"lmao, the Bucks literally just won the championship thanks to their defence, and they traded a ton of assets for a defensive sprcialist in Jrue Holiday that ultimately made extremely vital plays that made them won."
Jrue Holiday will be even more dominant.
"I mean this is objectively bullshit right. They can get more than mediocre role players for Simmons. I think there are teams in the league who would be willing to trade a functional guard or 3&amp;D guys for Simmons. DRose, Brogdon, KCP, Dinwiddie, Smart, Rubio, Rozier, Conley, or even Lonzo Ball - all these guys are guards who definitely can contribute to a winning team, and you wouldn't need to give up more than just Simmons, at worst add a depth player or pick, to get even 2 of them. NOP would have done a sign and trade for Lonzo in a heartbeat this off-season, and Lonzo is playing amazing rn.   All of those guys move the needle for the 6ers just like Jrue Holiday was the difference the Bucks needed to win a championship."
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
"We had Chris Paul, AD, and Jrue for years. Eventually most players will leave, so those were bad examples.  Randle signed a 1 year deal there to replace Boogie and we let him walk when we knew we were picking Zion, because they play the same position and neither can effectively play another one. Another bad example.  Christian Wood Barry played with us, and we waived him. Another bad example.  Pelicans could’ve brought Lonzo back if they wanted to, but decided to sign and trade him instead. That was the Pelicans decision, not Lonzo’s, so another bad example.  We literally extended JV before the season so that doesn’t even make sense.  Zion has lots of years left, and the Pelicans may want to trade Zion before Zion even wants to be traded with the way things are looking.  BI said he wants to be here and is behaving that way, plus he has multiple years left on his deal.  I could say Philly is a farm team because AI, Barkley, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and JJ Redick all left.  Also, Ben Simmons is about to leave.  Also, Joel Ennius will force us way out after you fail  to put enough talent around him and get eliminated early in the playoffs again.  Tobias Harris will probably want out after that too.  Let’s just play it safe and say Tyrese Maxey will want out after that as well.  How did that post even get this many upvotes? 🤦"
Also Jrue Holiday “rebuilding his value” when he was 22 coming off his lone All Star appearance when he arrived is an interesting way of looking at it. Feel like OP might be stretching slightly.

"I mean the 76ers aren’t particularly great at retaining talent either. Off the top of my head.   Andre Igoudala, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, Mikal Bridges, Al Horford, Ben Simmons (soon)  None of these guys are as criminal as AD and CP3, but you can conceivably make a deep playoff run with these guys alone."
"Yes, besides the Nuggets series this year, he either always underperforms or is cripplingly average in the playoffs. That's why I mentioned his ""reputation"". People think Dame is a playoff killer on a bad team and this year's playoffs just added more fuel to the fire. He has always been so-so in the playoffs. For example, he was the 3rd  best player in the Nuggets-Blazers series in 2019 after Jokic and CJ. For a superstar to be the 3rd best player in a series with CJ and a 23 talented but young center is unacceptable and embarrassing. Also, as you mentioned the fact that Dame couldn't take a game off the crippled Warriors tells you everything you need to know about Dame the playoff player.  Besides all this, let's not even talk about the series Dame had against Jrue Holiday and the pelicans where Dame was made to look like a role player. Comparatively, even Trae in his first playoffs faired better against Jrue,   As I mentioned this ""reputation"" is definitely the general consensus about Dame for the average NBA fan. The thing is Dame played a big part in constructing this reputation with all this talk of loyalty, having no help, and not joining a super team. This ""reputation"" is also why Dame is in the Top 75 over some other more deserving candidates"
back to back nights playing 40+ mins and 0 turnovers. playing against NY’s tough defense last night and Jrue Holiday tonight. solid.
"I'm not saying you're wrong but they added Jrue Holiday who was a big, big deal. It really brought them to another level. With him and adding PJ Tucker, they may have very well been champions over a healthy Nets squad. We really have no idea how good the Nets can actually be because well.. they've literally never been at full force."
"A million stars have been traded in recent years. Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday etc   The Blazers never seriously went after any of them. They could have beaten what some of those guys got back from the teams that traded for them."
Trade him for Jrue Holiday.
I want to personally apologize to Bucks fans. I placed a wager on Jrue Holiday to score at least 10 points tonight. That’s why he’s 3-13
"Morey is stupid though. Nobody will give up an all star for Simmons, even an all star that wants out. For example, if Zion wants to get traded, NOP would never trade him for Simmons. They would rather trade him for picks and blow up the team.    The problem with Morey's approach is that there is a cost to it. Right now he has a 35m in salary that is not being used because Simmons will not be an all-star caliber player for Philly ever again. If Simmons burns this season and you guys make a deep playoff run but don't win the chip, you fucked up by not trading for high quality role players/borderline stars - that could easily be all this team needs (Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Lonzo, types etc). Embiid only has a few more years of this level of dominance, and his health is always a question come playoff time. Every playoff run where he is healthy that gets burned without Simmons' replacement is a total failure."
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections.

Jrue Holiday.
&gt;Dame got a 6 seed without his #2 and #3 teammates for half of the year. Luka carries the Mavs  And where's that get them? Knocked out in round 1?   &gt;embiid does it  He's been playing next to an All NBA level player for a while.   &gt;AD is a very clear outlier of a “top 10” guy who can’t be the best player on a contending team.  Is he? I don't remember Luka ever being on a contender. Or Dame.   &gt;Jrue Holiday is a very good player  He was more injury prone than AD.   &gt;Mirotic was fine.  His Pelicans career was less than a full seasons worth of games.
"Dame got a 6 seed without his #2 and #3 teammates for half of the year. Luka carries the Mavs, Harden does it, embiid does it. AD is a very clear outlier of a “top 10” guy who can’t be the best player on a contending team. Some of those pelicans teams weren’t even that bad, Jrue Holiday is a very good player, Mirotic was fine. There’s just a big gap between him and players like Jokic."
"Mike Schmitz said that he’s likely to be similar to Jrue Holiday.. which is one hell of a player. Not the franchise player he was touted to be. But honestly, holiday would be a good outcome"
"Its crazy to me because i've been big on Jrue and Khris for a grip. 2 or so years ago I remember getting clowned a wee bit for begging the Bucks to pursue Holiday.  &amp;#x200B;  But I also just think in general the Bucks exacerbate the issue of reactionary fandoms, it went from Khris can't be a real number 2 and Jrue is ONLY good as a defensive guard as well as ""Fire Bud"" to now them suddenly all being top tier at their roles."
"Dude lol...  * Middleton, the second leading scorer on the team has been out the last 5 games due to covid.   * Brook Lopez, the Bucks starting center, has only played 1 game due to back issues and the Bucks don't have a backup center.  * Jrue Holiday, the third or second best player on the team (depending on who you talk to) has only played 4 games so far due to an injury he suffered in the first game of the season.   * Bobby Portis is bouncing back from an injury as well.   Why make a post about something you clearly know nothing about and just trying to be a hater. 5 seconds of googling would have told you all this."
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
Jrue Holiday seems like a really great guy.
"You said that even with four 1sts it would be a fleece, so I'm giving examples of trades that gave more than that and pointing out that they're all for better players than Jaylen Brown.  I don't even mean specifically for the Sixers to trade for Brown, just in general trading more than four 1sts is a lot, only happens for really top guys.  Also, look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kdr528/charania_breaking_giannis_antetokounmpo_says_he/) thread from when Giannis re-signed with Milwaukee, or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/jvn7u5/jrue_holiday_traded_to_the_bucks_for_eric_bledsoe/) from when Holiday was traded. Not really that important to this discussion, but I think any argument that trading for Jrue was not in large part to keep Giannis around is revisionist history. There were a lot of people worried that he might leave and teams were clearing up cap space to make a play for him."
"Talk is just talk. Just look at the numbers in the last month. Absolutely abysmal, you can tell he's frazzled by being outplayed by both Garland and Rubio, and that he is constantly in trade talks.  https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4277811/collin-sexton.  Rubio is wiser, craftier, more efficient in the +/- and is shooting 3s at a higher clip....than wait for it....the greatest shooter of all time, Steph Curry. He needs to be starting if the team wants to push for the playoffs this year...instead of HALF-TANK for the lottery as we always do.  And bruh you do know playoff basketball is DIFFERENT than regular season basketball right? Sexton might put up numbers in regular season. But playoff basketball is entirely difference. Its built on defense and its harder to score because of it. Aint no 6'0 backcourt ever going far in the playoffs, when was the last time that EVER happened. Garland/Sexton backcourt is a completely faucet on D. You really think they can go hold up defensively in the PLAYOFFS? Think with your head man, thats how teams win Championships, like how the Bucks traded away tiny shoot-first Bledsoe for DEFENSIVE BIG GUARD Jrue Holiday. Facts do not lie."
"Yeah he's fine if he knows his role.....Off the bench scorer...like another guy we shouldn't have gotten rid of, Jordan Clarkson.  His play style doesnt mesh with Garland, not because both are too short to be a playoff-starting backcourt, but doesnt fit into the flow of moving the ball around and execution.   Looking at Sexton's number he's been extremely inefficient, forcing things, esp like the end of last game. He was getting locked down and playing out of control. In that case he should be playing off the ball not with it and move with the flow of the offense. So yeah can he score in bunches, thats a good trait. But he needs to be able to do that in the flow of the game and execute. If Cavs want to make the playoffs and actually have a chance, they get Sexton to move to the bench (which he wont, he wants that money) or more likely package and trade him for more starting wing help, since if you dont have a solid two way 3 in this league you will be sunk with all the point forwards like Giannis, Lebron, Kawhi, etc all around. Seriously even Ben Simmons would fit this team better than Sexton because Ben passes and plays defense very well. As far as his shooting inadequacies, the Cavs are loaded with shooters now that Windler decided to stop being injured and Ricky Rubio is shooting 3's at a higher clip than Steph Curry! I like Sexton too, his heart and hustle, but if you want to see team success in the playoffs, you have to build your team that way and get in the right pieces. Just like the Bucks did last year, everyone on that team is extremely selfless (Getting rid of selfish Bledsoe for Jrue Holiday was masterful) and passes the ball....that's how you win championships. Sexton=OBJ right now"
"They have all their own picks, a couple of tradeable contracts in Schroeder/Smart, and a grab bag of young players. I feel like Jrue Holiday was acquired for about that price."
"&gt;Compared to a few years ago, the Celtics have far fewer assets.  Right... but compared to other teams our asset pool is pretty normal.  Miami didn't need 10 first-round picks from other teams to have the offseason you guys just had.   Milwaukee didn't need Billie King's first-born son to get Jrue Holiday and PJ Tucker last season."
Bradley Beal and Jrue Holiday really out there competing who's better at throwing games those last two minutes. No lead is safe for the wizards when Beal is consistently the ball handler at crunch time....
"Yeah, if only we had like a Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton or something, we’d probably be pretty good."
Dort  Ben Simmons  Marcus Smart  Jrue Holiday  Lonzo Ball  Kawhi  Giannis  Thybulle Butler   Caruso  Payton II
"There's also just the fact that less than 10 games is an incredibly small sample size for *any* kind of metric. Lillard ain't a 25% 3pt shooter, Jrue Holiday ain't a 55% 3pt shooter, etc.   LaMelo is valuable for sure, but I find it hard to believe that a guy who shoots below league average efficiency is the 4th most valuable/best player."
Jrue holiday x10
"Off the top of my head:  Jrue holiday, thybulle , Jevon Carter, Gary Payton ll, jimmy butler, dejounte Murray, Ben Simmons, dort, Smart, mikal"
Jrue holiday would've taken the wizards to second round if they replaced Westbrick with him
"Switch Westbrick with Jrue Holiday on the wizards last year and they would have made the second round at least.   Jrue, Trae, dame, unvaccinated Kyrie, Schroeder, D Fox, injured Klay, CP3, Elfrid Payton, Kyle Lowry, lonzo ball, lamelo ball, even Ben simmons are each &gt; Westbrick"
"If he stops shooting lol…  In all honesty yes. He does so much of everything else that shooting isn’t really a big deal, but you *need* that to come from elsewhere. Something the lakers don’t have without LeBron and AD. See him in a Jrue Holiday type role where you’re not the main guy but you distribute and take high % shots.  He needs to make like 50% of his current salary to be put in position to win."
"They had a lot of talented guys, though without that Rose injury, I don’t think they would have beaten the Bulls in the 2011-2012 season.  But that roster, Lou Williams, Andre Iguodala, Jrue Holiday, Thad Young, even Elton Brand was playing a solid vet role for that team. They had just drafted Vucevic. And Evan Turner was showing some signs of being a solid guy.  I always wonder what could have been if they didn’t trade for Andrew Bynum. Another year or two and all those guys may have made a serious run in the East."
"Thats by virtue of Russ being a legit nba guard, you could replace IT with Jrue Holiday or even Lonzo Ball and arguably add an additional 9 wins. IT was that bad  But i guess what’s impressive to you isn’t what’s impressive to me"
"He hasn't been playing, so he's easing in.  &gt;[**Holiday (ankle) is not in the starting lineup for Friday's game against the Knicks, but he is active and available off the bench**, Zora Stephenson of Fox Sports Wisconsin reports.](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/bucks-jrue-holiday-available-off-bench/)  &gt;[**Holiday has been sidelined nearly two weeks with an ankle issue, so it looks like the Bucks are going to ease him back into the swing of things**. As a result, George Hill will remain the starter at point guard. It is unclear what type of minutes Holiday will see.](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/bucks-jrue-holiday-available-off-bench/)"
"Ideally, it'd be at the 5-spot. Defending the rim sucks, but **ideally** you want Giannis at the 5 and surrounded by 4 shooters.   Look, obviously the pairing with him and Brook works well but Brook has only shot above league-average from 3 in one season with the Bucks and he's going to turn 34 in April. The Bucks need a succession plan.  Stretch-5's do not grow on trees. At the end of the day, there's only like 3 or 4 centers that shoot at or above league average from 3 on high volume.   Unless the Bucks get extremely lucky with a draft pick (which they probably won't - also consider they've mortgaged a ton of draft capital already for players like Jrue Holiday), I see Giannis playing the 5 more in the future. It also doesn't help that Giannis is on a supermax and as a whole, the Bucks aren't going to have a lot of flexibility in getting new players on the roster.  So given the Bucks situation, I think the **ideal** situation is Giannis plays more at center. We already saw that in the finals against Phoenix anyways. It fucking sucks, but that's what I see more of in the future.  In an optimistic world, it probably is *more ideal* to pair Giannis with a rim-protecting stretch-5 but once again I just don't see that happening given the Bucks situation."
Jrue Holiday
Michael Porter Jr  Kyrie if he counts  Jrue Holiday
"What Marcus Smart said you mean? He also said he is the answer to our offensive problems in the same statement While being one of the worst offensive starters in the league. Smart thinks he is a Hall of Famer but he is a career 36% shooter.  Tatum averages 8 potential assists a game this season, more than players like Jrue Holiday and Terry Rozier who are point guards. Even Brown averages 6 potential assists. They are 24 year old kids, obviously they still need to improve. Lebron didnt win until he was 27 , neither did Jordan or Giannis. Relax with the expectations for a team lead by 24 year olds"
Interesting question...maybe Kyle Lowry? De'Anthony Melton? Jrue Holiday?  Seems like a good topic for r/nbadiscussion
Jrue holiday isn’t an offensive liability like Gary Payton II.   And there was a lot more important things to the Bucks title run then Jrue Holidays defence. Incredibly valuable?
Jrue Holiday. Won the Bucks a championship. End of discussion
"Since AI. The major candidates since are Lou Williams and Jrue Holiday.  Here are their best scoring seasons on the Sixers taking both volume and efficiency into account.  **9-10 Lou Williams:**  14 ppg on 47/34/82 58%TS  One other season with 14.9 ppg but his TS was sub-50  **12-13 Jrue Holiday**  17.7 ppg on 43/37/75 50% TS  **20-21 Seth Curry (8 games)**  17.1 ppg on 61/54/85 76% TS  You could make the argument that he is a worse ""scorer"" because a lot of his shots are assisted:  **Assist rates:**  Lou 2pt% 34 3pt% 89  Jrue: 2pt% 25 3pt% 47  Curry: 2pt% 57 3pt% 86  However, I would argue his absurd efficiency still puts him over the top. I am also of the camp that moving offball is a form of shot creation. Tbf, I don't think this is sustainable over the course of the entire season. I see him dropping to somewhere to 15-16ppg on 45+% on 3s which is still absurd."

Dame was a 5th pick that year. Even if they had the exact same record and had the same 5th pick it doesn’t guarantee a superstar. The next 4 draftees at #5 are Alex Len 2013. Dante Exum 2014. Mario Henzonja 2015. Kris Dunn 2016. Plenty of other too picks are misses as well.   That’s assuming they never improve and are able to pick 5th every year. It’s more than losing games and getting high picks. Just gotta hit when you do. And pick up quality free agents.   Obviously they could’ve picked different players but the point stands that having high picks isn’t the problem as much as hitting the picks like they did with McCollum. Tanking doesn’t guarantee you anything.   I’d rather win 50 games and try to trade or get free agents to join me. That’s Portlands biggest issue. Warriors were a 50 win team then they picked up Iggy. Lakers MO is free agency. Bucks traded for Jrue Holiday. Raptors traded for Kawhi. Portland sucks at getting Dame help through other means.
Jrue Holiday picks but 2 more valuable players. Probably one average starter (Wiggins) and a top level prospect
"He needs to be a top 4 guard in the East to secure a spot. Although teams can have up to 6 guards total depending on the coach's reserves picks.  Trae, Harden, Kemba, Lowry, Butler, LaVine, Lonzo, Derrick Rose, Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, and Bradley Beal all have cases over him."
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Jrue Holiday  Brook Lopez   just won the championship this year.  Id have to imagine adding one of the greatest players of all time in Steph Curry wouldnt hurt
I'd sooner assume the clippers win than the jazz.  That is unless davion somehow turns into prime jrue holiday on defence because fuck me the jazz constantly fail due to their perimeter defence
"You broke us in the Bubble man, our team has never and will never be the same since that series.   Also the PG position is finally starting to get it's due in terms of how incredibly important it is. Bucks trade for Jrue Holiday and go from being the biggest embarrassment in the league in the Bubble to hoisting the Larry O'Brien trophy the next year. Suns trade for Chris Paul and go from out of the playoffs to making the Finals. Jazz added Mike Conley and now they are a serious contender.   And obviously now for the best example, you guys added Kyle Lowry and look at the difference he's made to your team that got embarrassed last year."
Smart is one of the best on-ball defenders short of Jrue Holiday
That’s only marginally worse than the Bucks the past two years in games without Jrue Holiday
Ben for Jrue Holiday who says no.
Franz can be the perfect 4.  Suggs can be a two way all star like jrue holiday.
"&gt; Not once did I imply anything of the sort. This must have occurred inside your head.   This you?  &gt; No rational player looks at Gobert and thinks “he’s the weak link in the defence, not Jordan Clarkson”. It just isn’t rational.  lmao  &gt; If you’re telling me you don’t see Jokic take it to the rack on the regular then I question how often you actually watch him.   Not what I said, but that scoring isn't always his #1 priority.   &gt; I think you’re confusing targeting Gobert with playing the game through your best player. Imo a targeted offence involves finding the weakest link in the defence (obviously not Gobert) and creating a positional mismatch.  So then is it impossible for Harden to target Steph, if it requires a positional mismatch? Or for MPJ to be targeted by Lebron/Kawhi/PG? I don't think requiring a positional mismatch is a necessary for targeting another player, I think targeting a defender is just trying to score specifically against them, and I think that's the commonly understood definition. If you asked most people I don't think they'd require a positional mismatch.  Arguing that targeting can only occur against the weakest defender is fallacious as well. Simply because it is not the optimal decision does not mean that no one makes it.  &gt; Jokic going against Gobert is actually the complete opposite of a targeted offence.  ...because they're the same position? Lmao like I said this would mean Lebron or Kawhi couldn't target MPJ, despite that being a major narrative of other playoff series the Nuggets have played.   &gt; But Clarkson definitely can’t guard him and would fair much worse than Gobert.  I mean like I said, choosing an option that is not the optimal option does not mean the sub-optimal choice isn't still targeting the player. This, again, is where you're arguing that it didn't make sense to you therefore it didn't happen.  &gt; Gobert being Jokic’s primary defender is just Utah doing their best to slow down an elite talent.  And Denver has decided that the best way to attack this is by putting Gobert on an island and making him go one-on-one vs. Jokic. This means that he will rack up fouls quicker and be less aggressive later in the game. How is that not targeting Gobert? It's specifically attacking him, on purpose.   &gt; A targeted offence involves forcing a mismatch on the opposing defence’s least preferred defender.  Targeting is not about what the defense wants, but what the offense wants. If it is more advantageous for the best defender to be attacked so that he can't defend as well later in the game, then the offense wants to attack that defender even if it isn't the best option for that specific possession. Strategy decisions in a basketball game are generally made on the scale of the game, not on a per-possession basis.   &gt; Here’s a thought exercise. The Warriors go against the Bucks in the finals. Jrue Holiday, arguably the best guard defender in the league, is tasked as Steph’s primary defender. He does as good a job as he can, but Steph being Steph still feasts and drops an efficient 30 ppg. Does that mean he was targeting Jrue as the weak link in the defence? Or did Milwaukee assign Jrue as his primary defender and Steph played well because he’s that good?  That means nothing because you're saying nothing about how the possessions actually play out. Steph could have put up 30ppg by running around screens and taking open 3s, this says nothing about how he was getting the points.  If he got some of his points by isolating Jrue, having the rest of his teammates clear out, then those possessions would be targeting Jrue. Now let me turn this thought exercise around on you: The Warriors choose to attack the Bucks' best perimeter defender, Jrue, early in the game in order to get him in foul trouble. The Warriors' best option for attacking is using their best guard, Steph. He gets 4 fouls in the first half, and can't defend Steph as aggressively in the second half. This results in the Warriors recouping more points in the second half than they lost in the first, and thus is a net positive offensive strategy. Was this not an offense targeting Jrue?"
"&gt;Your entire comments are literally “I didn’t watch it and can’t reference any play or game, but here’s why it’s impossible.  Not once did I imply anything of the sort.  If you’re telling me you don’t see Jokic take it to the rack on the regular then I question how often you actually watch him. He’s the second best post scorer in the league behind Embiid and in addition takes guys off the dribble quite often. He’s an elite, three level scorer which includes taking it to the rim, among other things.   I think you’re confusing targeting Gobert with playing the game through your best player. Imo a targeted offence involves finding the weakest link in the defence (obviously not Gobert) and creating a *positional mismatch*. A great example is LeBron targeting Lou Williams in those Lakers/Clippers matchups.  Jokic going against Gobert is actually the complete opposite of a targeted offence. A targeted offence would have Jokic posting up Jordan Clarkson, Mike Conley and the like. Don’t get me wrong, Gobert can’t guard Jokic effectively. But Clarkson *definitely* can’t guard him and would fair much worse than Gobert.  Gobert being Jokic’s primary defender is just Utah doing their best to slow down an elite talent. Think of it this way: if Utah had the choice between Jokic posting up Gobert or posting up Donavon Mitchell, which one do you think they’d prefer? Obviously neither can stop him. But I think we both know who’d have a better chance at slowing him down. A targeted offence involves forcing a mismatch on the opposing defence’s *least* preferred defender.  Here’s a thought exercise. The Warriors go against the Bucks in the finals. Jrue Holiday, arguably the best guard defender in the league, is tasked as Steph’s primary defender. He does as good a job as he can, but Steph being Steph still feasts and drops an efficient 30 ppg. Does that mean he was targeting Jrue as the weak link in the defence? Or did Milwaukee assign Jrue as his primary defender and Steph played well because he’s that good?"
"Lol I wouldn't call Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic enough help to face the Spurs dynasty, the CP3 and Harden Rockets, or obviously the GS superteam but yes I will admit AD is not as good of a floor raiser as probably the goat floor raiser sadly"
You think they can’t play good defense because of physical limitations? What makes CP3 or Jrue Holiday that much more athletic or capable of playing defense? I imagine it’s because they don’t spend as much time working on that part of their game.
Giannis is that good he’s making people think that having Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday alongside him equates to being a superteam.
"Bobby Portis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Donte Divincenzo are all out on a SEGABABA."
"Are you referring to the RAPTOR stat? That states Kyle Lowry was -1.1 even though he's known was a good defender. LeBron James was +.6 even though he was considered coasting on defense last season. Luka was -0.8 and no one would say he's a better defender than Lowry and be taken seriously. Jrue Holiday was +1.1. Derrick Rose, Cameron Payne and Raul Neto are all better defenders than him by this metric.  This is why advanced stats aren't the end all be all. They're usually only useful for comparing people on the same team. Which is why Sexton being -0.5 and Garland being -3.0 so far this season is significant. Within their own team, Garland drags the defense down much more. Defenses are way more about teams than individual players. Which is why usually most people on a good defensive team even the bad defenders have good defensive advanced stats number."
"While it would be fair to argue Blazers aren't in the top 10 futures (this season included and on), we also definitely aren't bottom 10.  We don't owe all our picks to other teams (such as Lakers, Clippers, Nets, Bucks).  We owe one, but it is permanently lotto protected.  We are a playoff team, holding onto the longest playoffs streak.    If you view the NBA as championship or bust, there are arguments we aren't well positioned for that.  I hate that view personally.    We have a home-drafted superstar who thus far is still with us and we couldn't be happier to have him.  We have a couple of exciting young prospects.  There isn't a player on our squad I dislike (and as far as I can tell, the fan consensus).    The last reason why we're middling in this topic, being the future, is we could get a good bit back if we did rebuild.  Dame would/should go for a a package somewhere between the Jrue Holiday, James Harden, and Anthony Davis packages.  CJ can bring back a good player or pick or 2 (depending on salary matching.  Could be a wide array).  Nurkic I bet it worth a bit.  Even our role players in RoCo, Nance, Powell are worth a bit if we went full reset.  So whether our future is with this squad or a rebuild, we won't be the bottom 10 imo."
"Middleton and Holiday deserve the max from Milwaukee because they had the #1 player and surrounding pieces already. There's an opportunity cost to giving people max contracts because of how the NBA works and it made sense for the bucks.  Let's say hypothetically that Jrue and Khris both were FA next year and both went to the cavs and said ""we want to play for you."" Would you be happy if the cavs dumped a ton of picks to get rid of Love to make room and also traded away Allen to make room?  Players like Lowry, Holiday, etc, are on a small tier below 'real' max contract players that have very different value based on the team. If KD rang a GM and said ""just make cap space and I'll sign,"" you make cap space for him. Same thing with Jokic, Giannis, Luka, Steph, Lebron.   When you say ""Most contenders have 3 max guys,"" it's because the way the NBA works means that there's someone out there that may only get a near max from other teams that you can get by promising them a full max, and you need him to win a championship. But if you sign that guy before you get your #1 then you're wasting money (or you like to go all in when you have 2-3-4-5 and need a 6 to pull a straight on the last card)."
"I do, but I feel like giving a guy like Jrue Holiday 30% of the cap is a waste. And yes I’m aware the base cap is easy to work around"
"His stats look like shit, but that's largely because  A) he's mainly just creating tons of chaos on the offensive end through touchdown passes that end up being hockey assists once more pieces come up-court  B) defensive stats (aside from BPG/SPG) aren't really found in the box score  There's something to be said about how Miami's starting 5 defensive scheme can now reliably switch **everything** because of how good Lowry is on defense. Not like, Jrue Holiday good, but he's able to keep up on the perimeter, guard guards in the post (he even guarded Miles Bridges in the post tonight on multiple occasions and was a reliable defender there) and has the IQ to communicate with our other 3 defensive stalwarts in Jimmy/Bam/PJ.   He's also somehow managed to, in short order, impart wisdom onto Tyler Herro and turn him into a reliable bench playmaker of sorts. It's **wizardry**. If 3yr/$75m is what it costs to get this much value and nearly nothing in the box score, I'm completely for it."
Yeah I guess I could see a Jrue Holiday type. Which is a pretty decent player at 5 I suppose. Thanks!
"A popular predraft comp was Jrue Holiday, but IMO, he's closer to Marcus Smart."
3rd best player at his peak for OKC.  Dort should be a Canadian Jrue holiday that's the role he should look to play for OKC.   OKC just needs one more star and I think they can be legit.
&gt; Not having Jrue Holiday is certainly a big part of the slowish start  We have two of our starters! Pat Connaughton has been our starting Centre for three games and Thanasis for one! When Giannis isn't on the floor our tallest player was fucking 6'7! An undrafted two-way player has been playing 15 minutes a game! I *wish* it was just Jrue who was unavailable.
"Where on earth did I say Herro hasn’t improved? You also didn’t answer the question about this season. Have you watched KPJ play for an extended amount of time? Because if you have, and since you’ve watched him so much before, you’ll see a much smarter player who’s adjusting his game. He’ll still show flashes of what we saw last year, but he’s figuring out how to play a new spot. I’m still comfortable saying KPJ will be the better player by the end of season. I fully see a world where that’s the wrong take, but if you don’t see it as a possibility I don’t know what to tell you.   Also, that 50 point game was against the NBA champions who didn’t rest anybody. KPJ was also guarded by Jrue Holiday. Stop trying to undersell it to prove your point. You’re right it’s one game (he also had a number of great showings last year) but saying it was a meaningless game no one cared about  is pretty disingenuous."
Jrue Holiday
Because Philly hasn’t had a real point guard since Jrue Holiday
pacers just need jrue holiday and it's championship time
"Pardon my ignorance, but is Justin and Aaron Holiday related to Jrue Holiday?"
At least a Jrue Holiday type of trade package
Kemba Walker  Jrue Holiday  Bojan Bogdanovic  Christian Wood  Jusuf Nurkic
"PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Jrue Holiday  SF: Tobias Harris  PF: Marcus Morris  C: De'Andre Ayton  4 very solid defenders around Kemba Walker, and everyone here can score themselves too."
Whatever Charlotte PG you think is worse between Ball and Graham   Jrue Holiday   Mikal Bridges   Tobias Harris   DeAndre Ayton
"Jrue Holiday, Caris Lavert, Tobias Harris, RoCo, Ayton"
"So I think Malcon Brogdon is a great guard, and his greatness is within his consistency as a player; however, with that being said I think Jrue Holiday has a higher possible upside but just isn't as consistent as of lately. Jrue holiday also provides some much-needed defense at the guard position, but as far as an upgrade you're right its not a huge one some would argue its even a step back"
"Ok, let's say the finals are a wash. 2015 Warriors faced Pelicans with Jrue Holiday playing 55 minutes throughout 3 games with a leg injury, a decent series against the Grizz, and then Rockets missing all-defensive Beverly. Not to mention KD and Russ were out with injures in the West.  A ring is a ring, but that was by far the most injury-ridden playoff run of the decade."
A fun question: is Brogdon better than Jrue Holiday? Imo he might be
"Jrue Holiday is such a massive improvement on Bledsoe.   But god damn does Lopez stink this year, Vucevic was owning him all night. Idk what it is but he has not looked good much at all this year."
Jrue Holiday  Marcus Smart  James Harden  The Holy Trinity of Guard Post Defenders
"CJ might be one of the most underrated guards in the game today alongside Jrue Holiday.  If this hella deep team stays healthy, I’m finally hoping they make it over the hump this year."
"I love Jrue Holiday and I hate when guys back down for that long, stall the offense, and then jack up a fadeaway. So this one is a win-win."
One of the best post defenders of the league is a 6'3/6'4 guard and his name is Jrue Holiday
This game is so close that I’m Prepared to be disappointed.  Also can Jrue Holiday F off.  His defense is too annoying.
AG needs to stop trying to take on Jrue Holiday like wyd
I dont think letting people do whatever they want with no explanation is a courtesy really anyone gets. The least he could do is tell people what's going on. Players have had serious off-court issues to deal with before (Jrue Holiday for ex.) but they didnt just bail and keep their team in the dark.
"You made the comparison  not me.  The point was you can't compare what Hinkie did because it was unprecedented which is why what the league did was unprecedented.  And btw he traded a 22 year old ago star Jrue Holiday for an injured Nerlens Noel and a pick so he traded a player better than SGA. And it's also a microcosm of why he's essentially banned from the league.   He then took that pick and traded it for Saric and another pick knowing Saric couldn't come over.  Great transaction absolutely but the body of work showed a pattern of behavior the league couldn't allow.  This isn't a difficult notion.  It had nothing to do with lying or being up front.  If he would have even made a fake attempt at putting out a 35 win team he could've kept doing the asset flipping. But he was trying to put out 15 win teams on purpose, year after year. That is untenable"
Fuck it trade them both for jrue holiday and a bunch of young players
"Actually yeah that makes sense, because then we can do this:  - Bradley Beal - Jrue Holiday - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - James Harden - Zach LaVine"
"Steph / Luka / Bron / Holiday / Simmons as your starting five, a little undersized but four amazing playmaker, five guys who can make their own shot, three defensive stoppers plus two guys who can hold their own, everyone in the floor is a genius in their own way. Calling Jrue and Bron a PG is kind of cheating, but positions are pretty flexible so 🤷‍♂️"

"After the first game of the season, I traded Hayward and Grant for Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday 🤣"
"Better team than last year. We aren't really playing any worse than we did in the bubble. Jrue Holiday is also an improvement to our team. We had a lot of old guys who couldn't really cut it last year on the bench. Bud seems pretty insistent on giving Thanasis minutes, might have something to do with Giannis taking the super max. Most of our team is new so I expect a bit of time to get rolling and into the season"

"I don't know if Trae can start playing that way out of nowhere. Curry can do it because he was a shooting guard before he was a point guard, so he's always played offball. Pretty much every guard who sometimes plays point and has a good mix of offball-onball play (e.g. Beal, Jamal Murray, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday) has always played offball their entire career."
By Current Skill 1. Chris Paul 2. Kyle Lowry 3. Kemba Walker 4. Jrue Holiday 5. CJ McCollum  By Contract / Asset Value 1. CJ McCollum 2. Jrue Holiday 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Kemba Walker 5. Chris Paul
"Gary Harris is also 6'4 vs Doncic who is 6'8. Luka feasts on smaller defenders, he's made Jrue Holiday look silly multiple times"
Bruce Brown could be our poor mans Jrue holiday from what I saw tonight and the fact that he’s good makes the loss of Dinwiddie so much easier to stomach. Why tf was he not playing before
Ja morant didn’t have a Jrue holiday
"Not the Bucks? Idk dude Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Giannis can all check KD with some success, and imo they’d have the best player in that series. Really depends on whether you believe in Caris LeVert, since the starters are sort of a wash."
"Dude had amazing two way player Jrue Holiday and playmaking legend Rajon Rondo with the pels. Jokic has 0 other all-stars on his roster, except for Murray who's fringe all-star at best."
"Outside of Jamal Murray in the bubble, who has jokic had? Ad had jrue holiday so that cancels out right there"
"Oh yeah, is that why the season when AD sat out because he wanted to get traded Jrue holiday had 7.7 apg? His New Orleans career high with Julius Randle as his second option?  Bro, at this point you just gotta shut up and listen. How can you deny those lol? And he was 13th in **total** assists, not apg. By that metric Spencer Dinwiddie was better than Chris Paul in 2017-2018"
"I believe he’s top 30, but you could replace him with someone like Jrue Holiday or Jamal Murray  My point was just that the pacers def don’t have 3 top 25 guys"
"Basically, I think part of the issue with Milwaukee was Bledsoe. I think him taking touches away from Brogdon was a net negative at the end of the day for Milwaukee, as would be him taking away touches from Jrue Holiday if he were still there. He just isn’t a good enough shooter to have success as an off the ball player, while Brogdon was, which meant Brogdon was designated as the guy to spot up and shoot.  He had a ton of success at that (50/40/90 club member) but he was capable of a lot more than that. That’s basically his issue with Milwaukee IMO, Brogdon could’ve been a bigger contributor but he wasn’t due to how the roster was constructed."
Compared to what jrue holiday got I think they can
"If Jrue Holiday got 3 firsts and 2 swaps, then Lowry is gonna get us more than just one first."
"Brogdon is great with the ball in his hands and off the ball. He’s not a guy that needs the ball in his hands to succeed. Not anymore than a guy like Jrue Holiday does  If Brogdon wasn’t happy playing off the ball for 90% of his time then that’s one thing, but he certainly had success doing it."
"I would rather have Jrue Holiday. I love Brogdon but with him we still couldn't get past the Raptors. It's incorrect to just add his stats to the current Bucks and assume thats the difference. We had a better chance against the Raps than the last year in the bubble, and I dont see him being the difference. Bledsoe is far inferior, but turning that contract into Jrue is a huge play for us. I take our current team over the 2019 team in the playoffs. Brogdon is looking great, but slashing is also a big part of his game. The defense of teams we face is always tight because of trying to counter Giannis. Not sure Brogdon would have had the ball in his hands enough to be making the same plays. It's also possible the Bucks FO thought that Brogdon wouldn't have commanded high offer sheets as he did and they could have kept him and extended. Either way I'm glad the way it worked out; we got rid of a poor playoff performer and added someone of higher talent and made moves to compete in the playoffs. You can't really ask for much more than that in a FO. Every move has been made to stay competitive and improve and we signed Giannis to the super. If the Bucks win a chip during that contract nobody can knock the Bledsoe/Brogdon moves at all"
"Considering Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Marcus Smart, Lu Dort are all out there, I don't see how Schroder can squeeze in."
Jrue Holiday.  Good on offense  Beast on defense
"We’re 7 games in where most guys have crazy inflated stats and he’s still averaging almost identical PPG all of the last 3 years, including when he played alongside Anthony Davis and averaged 21 a game in the same lineup as Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. He’s now averaging 22 with RJ Barrett and Reggie Bullock. This is who he is and why the Knicks paid him. Miles different is when DLo jumped 6 PPG including a few 40 point showings. I know Knicks fans are dying to make that leap and become attractive again, but if it’s going to happen it has to be RJ and not Randle who does that, plain and simple."
"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
I’d trade the Jrue Holiday pick package for Rozier and none of you can talk me out of it.
"You don't need to remind me of the 2017 series, I know damn well how that series went (sadly). AD was great but Jrue Holiday was also an animal. Dude was unstoppable on both ends of the court. That was a 1A and 1B sweep, not AD's magnum opus of a series like Lebron against the Warriors or something. But I will give him credit for that single playoff series win before last season, that was already factored in when I put him in my list of the top 5 players in the league.   Leading the league in PER one year in 2014 and blocks for a few years is great, but we're talking about top 2-3 in the league dude... that's not exactly enough of an argument to catapult him higher than #5 is it? Did you see the stats I stated for Giannis? That's the bar I've set for who I'd put as #2. I've already established AD is a top 5 player in the NBA so you'll have to do better than that... actually it kind of sounds like you've got him #2... so I'd really expect that to see better stats to support that.   I'm not sure why the 2014 season would be a knock against Giannis 6 years later and not sure why AD being the #1 pick is as relevant today seeing as there are plenty of #1 picks that don't pan out. Giannis winning back to back MVPs the past 2 seasons is *wayy* more relevant than AD being the #1 pick 8 years ago. I don't treat Giannis like he is Lebron during his first stint in Cleveland, I think these are two incredibly different players and would still take B2B MVP Lebron in 2009 &amp; 2010 (still his first stint in CLE) over Giannis 10 times out of 10. I'm not comparing Giannis to Lebron since I've already got him #2."
Dame and Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday might as well have killed Dame on the spot
"I believe this stat doesn’t count fast breaks so I could see it being lower than expected, especially lower than a lead guard like SGA.  Edit: I’m sure adding jrue holiday also had some effect on it as well."
"I don’t have to imagine that, we were one of the worst three point shooting teams in the league pre-Bud and we still didn’t get swept in the first round. And, y’know, our starting PG had a habit of shooting 20% in the playoffs.  It’s some real simpleton shit to go “oh yeah one really good shooter and one guy who may or may not be any good depending on the night &gt; Jrue Holiday” for a team that was already demonstrably worse than us."
Adding Jrue Holiday makes us significantly better both defensively and offensively.   I certainly wouldn’t call us outsiders.
JH would be a cool team  Jrue Holiday James Harden Jeff Hornacek John Havlicek Juwan Howard Josh Howard Joe Harris
Who else is in contention. I think a healthy Kemba sneaks in and someone like Jrue Holiday has been underrated his whole career but is really good. + who knows if Van Vleet/Lowry bounce back

I swear to god, most of you people watch some highlights of Curry or Chris Paul putting Gobert on skates and that’s formed your entire opinion of his defense. Read up on him before before spouting your uninformed take.   Same thing with his offense. He isn’t amazing, but he’s a great screen setter, good roll man and a lob threat. He is not a liability on offense.   With him, the Jazz are a decent playoff team with an outsize chance at WCF / Finals. Without him, they’re a lottery team and Mitchell leaves. So yes, you do pay him the 200 million over him leaving. Does it mean he’s worth 200m, especially comparing him to other centers like Embiid or Jokic? No. But he’s worth 200m to the Jazz because of their circumstances as a small market team. I don’t know how that’s so hard to grasp."
"After what Jrue holiday did to him in 2018 was so bad I can’t get over it. Dude is mad overrated   Hell he couldn’t even beat the warriors after Durant got injured in 2019. I don’t even mean beat them in the series, he couldn’t even beat an injured team in a single game in that series"
"In no particular order: Brogdan, Oladipo, Sexton, Trae Young, Kyrie, Kemba, Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic, Zach Lavine, Lowry, Beal, and Russ are all better   And that’s not even including guys with higher ceilings like Garland or Fultz.   He’s not a top 5 guard in the east. Sorry"
"Always been underrated. Came to Indiana and assumed a much larger on-ball role. This is a controversial take, so feel free to flame me, but I don't actually think the difference between him and Jrue Holiday is that big. Jrue's better but Brogdon is closer than people think and is probably a better on-ball player. Bucks still might win it all, so they'll be fine. Just saying."
I based it on Bam making the jump to defensive player of the year. The Heat is a very good team when all their players are healthy. The reason I put them over the Bucks because I don’t think Jrue Holiday was enough to make them a better team. It is very likely the Bucks could outshine them in the regular season I could easily see a 2/3 swap but I don’t think Jrue makes the team better than the Heat. The Heat has many young guys that are only getting better from last year

we have jrue holiday... who’s even better   ppl love shitting on the bucks lmao
"To not waste more gas with you since you are quick to dismiss reality, Utah will remain a perennial 6-8 seed whose realistic objective is to get to second round. This is the squad that you will call ""full of difference makers"".  Jrue Holiday (a reserve all star just like Donovan ""Kobe"" Mitchell) Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis as well as Paul George and Chris Paul were all traded for Role players and that's just in the last two years.  I would've gone for Chris Paul, or Jimmy rather than the corpse of Mike Conley when they had the chance.  If going to the second round to lose 8/9 games is what you call doing more, I'm intrigued to see what you call doing less.  I take it that this year ""since they have Bogi"" they'll win two games in the conference semi finals and pat one another in back ."
"&gt; Except Gobert who is a defensive prodigy no player in the squad is a difference maker.  Shit man. It took you this many comments to let me know you don't actually watch the NBA? You should lead with that so we can dismiss you as a troll.  &gt;The Lakers, Raptors, 76ers, Bucks and OKC all managed to get all stars (borderline MVP players) with role player trades for superstar ""rentals"", which is what I would do if i were the GM of a bad playoff team like the Jazz.  Yeah, who'd you go for? That idea really sounds like their trade for Mike Conley which I've already gone over. If you've got Conley on the team already how to you get rid of him while taking on a player with the exact same contract situation and not give up all your draft capital? I also wouldn't count Jrue Holiday or Josh Richardson as trading for a superstar. As for the Lakers and Raptors where's the AD or Kawhi level player they can trade for right now? How do you build a trade for Harden around Mike Conley?  &gt;I would be much more like OKC which is fielding the same amount of success as the Jazz with a cheaper squad and more picks.  Again, with their trade for PG you're suggesting exactly what I've written two comments saying they're planning on doing. Also since trading for PG the Thunder have made the second round exactly Zero times. A younger version of this Jazz team without Bogi made the second round twice and has two players still entering their prime. The Thunder have consistently done less with more while the Jazz have consistently done more with less."
"It's gotta be Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic/Bam Adebayo or Jaylen Brown/Kemba Walker.   Those are the only 3rd options in the league that are all star caliber players."
"This is stupid. If you put 2020 Dame on the 2015 Warriors instead of Steph, then yeah they’re probably going to be competing for the title and possibly winning it. But Dame simply wasn’t as good as Curry back then, he has really taken a leap from the 2019 season on. It wasn’t that long ago where Dame got absolutely shut down by Jrue Holiday and his team got swept by the Pelicans."
"99% of draft boards in 2018 had Luka-Ayton-Bagley as the top 3 picks, with people that saw Luka saying that he was No.1 for sure and people that only watched NCAA basketball having Ayton No.1. Trae was never even in consideration for a Top 3 pick.  It's easy to say now that they should've picked Trae, but that's just dumb, nobody knew at the time that Trae would be this good and after Ayton was gone at 1, Bagley and Luka were objectively the better prospects remaining, Kings just picked the wrong one.  Saying this would be the same as saying that the Clippers made a mistake picking Blake Griffin instead of James Harden in 2009. Yeah, we know now that Harden turned out to be better, but Griffin was by far the best prospect in a draft that featured Harden, Steph, DeRozan and Jrue Holiday."
"&gt; With AD you need to come up with a hypothetical where he's playing with ""a playmaker"" (the subtext being that they must be better than Jrue Holiday when Giannis himself never even had that luxury) to even entertain the possibility he might be a better first option than Giannis. Because he hasn't actually proven that whatsoever, not to the degree Giannis has and sure as shit not to the degree Hakeem/Kareem/Shaq did lol  Bro this isn't even true. Jrue was enough for AD to put up better numbers in the playoffs than Giannis. AD also didn't have a 2x COTY and supporting cast built around him to hide his weaknesses."
"Of course they were. You and the other guy are acting like I said ""you have to be the primary playmaker to be the first option, sorry that's the rule, too bad AD lol."" Giannis has proven he can be the first option on a contender (or even just a home-court team) where he's unequivocally the best player. With AD you need to come up with a hypothetical where he's playing with ""a playmaker"" (the subtext being that they must be better than Jrue Holiday when Giannis himself never even had that luxury) to even entertain the possibility he might be a better first option than Giannis. Because he hasn't actually proven that whatsoever, not to the degree Giannis has and sure as shit not to the degree Hakeem/Kareem/Shaq did lol"
Jrue Holiday?
"Which holiday, though? Justin, Jrue, or Aaron?"
Didnt know Jrue Holiday and Rondo were trash af
"For what it's worth Brown was among the next two players I would have listed. Frankly if you believe that Siakam's bad spell of form is more than that you can even put him on the back-end of the top 30.  As mentioned in another reply Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry and CJ McCollum would be included in my 30-40 range. range."
"I never subscribed to this claim. Sabonis was a deserved all-star last season. That being said he's got to keep on performing to really establish himself in the top30. There's some big names in the top 30-40 range.  Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum and others."
Suggs is more of a Jrue Holiday type
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12.

Jrue Holiday is also in
"That's gotta be a two-way street. From my perspective, Zion seems like he wants to win more than the team does. There isn't really alignment on goals. Otherwise, it's hard to understand how they thought taking a team that didn't make the playoffs, removing Jrue Holiday/Derrick Favors and adding Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams was going to be a winning formula.  The team has more assets to use to build a better team but they seemed relatively content being a subpar team this year. Zion from his side seems pretty intent on winning. This is a guy who came back to play for Duke after a knee injury when he could have easily sat out and still been the #1 pick in the draft. Obviously he's far from a perfect player, but I'm not sure you could realistically ask more from him this past year."
If you swap Ben Simmons with Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton the Sixers fucking maul you. The Hawks will lead for less than 5 minutes in the series and Giannis is going to average 45 points
Don't get too cocky Hawks fan lol series hasn't even started yet.  Jrue holiday is going to lock Trae up lol Trae is about to find out what the NBA playoffs is really about.
"This is what the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for. If Jrue can guard KD, he'll be just fine against Trae."
Foul on Jrue Holiday according to NBA refs lol
NBA ref: *Foul on Jrue Holiday!*
Honorable mentions need to include:  * Kevin Durant * Chris Bosh * Horford * Jrue Holiday * Chris Paul
"I haven’t read a ton about this draft but it seems the common wisdom is that there are about 5 true high potential prospects with Cunningham being far and away the best. So yeah I would say falling out of that group would be pretty disappointing.   I also agree with you that the Bucks and Suns are largely organic, but they also demonstrate the importance of adding well timed, high fit veterans to get a young team over the hump. CP3 and Jrue Holiday specifically, though Crowder and such have been good."
"I guess we will see. Giannis is clearly a top 5 player maybe even top 3. If Middleton is as good as you think and they also have Jrue Holiday, they should win a ring this year and I'll be wrong."
Imagine trading Simmons for Jrue Holiday at the beginning of the year.
"Reading wiki, the most notable will be Jrue Holiday."
"Agreed. Thought about Murray and Christian Wood myself  PG Tyrese Haliburton   SG Jrue Holiday   SF Khris Middleton   PF Ben Simmons   C  Myles Turner   The smart play is probably to put Murray at one of the guard spots but I like the kid and think he would flourish with these players. I envision Simmons running the offense and defense ala Draymond while having better coverage on D from Turner and the Junkyard Dog, Jrue Holiday."
"Yeah I know I named 10 guys, but he'll have proven to be a more accomplished playoff performer than Luka and Embiid if he makes the Finals. That's a damned solid argument to put him over either of those in your top 10 - especially if he continues to average 25+ in a Finals series against Jrue Holiday.  To clarify, I don't think not having him in the top 10 is that egregious. But to dismiss the argument altogether is a brain-dead thing."
*1st team All NBA Defense Jrue Holiday as entered the chat*
"Similarly, [this call](https://youtu.be/2W6oYPJ1nIk) by the Pels announcers when D-Rose hit a game winner against them is so memorable to me bc of the hope draining out from their voices lol.  “Derrick Rose against Jrue Holiday. Aaand he’s got the little midrange. That’s it. It’s over.”"
"The Sixers that season matched up better against the Bucks than the Raptors. Defensively they had Embiid down low to switch onto Giannis and that's after Giannis having to get through Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons. This Bucks team also didn't have Jrue Holiday and was a much weaker version of the current Bucks team. Looking at how the series Raptors and Bucks ended up, there is no reason the Sixers can't replicate that result."
"That's true, but they started in different situations  The Celtics accumulated picks by trading away two all-stars (or perceived all stars) in a very lop sided traded. Most teams don't have the luxury of starting their rebuild in that way  The 76ers started by trading with Jrue Holiday and a poor roster"
"so did jrue holiday, does that mean they should keep Bud?"
"This is a more detailed account of his tenure than I can write- https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5w63er/analysis_of_sam_hinkies_tenure_as_unbiased_as/  Hinkie is definitely overrated by some, but saying he only made one good move is also really unfair.  His draft picks don't look great, but he typically went with the consensus BPA.  Sixers had awful lottery luck for years- took them years to get the #1 and the Lakers held onto their own pick for years with their own tanking.  Hinkie also wanted KP over Okafor, for what that's worth.  Hinkie found a ton of diamonds in the rough- RoCo, Jerami Grant, McConnell, Richaun Holmes.  Who knows how much credit he deserves for that, as you'd expect any team with that much roster turnover will stumble upon some gems.  His biggest strength was in his trades.  The Stauskas trade in particular was really strong, but he basically never lost a trade in his time there.  Very similar to how Presti's running the Thunder now, but instead of starting his rebuild with PG &amp; Russ, Hinkie had Jrue Holiday and the corpse of Andrew Bynum.  He wasn't a perfect GM.  He underrated the impact a losing culture would have on his players and their development, and how it would impact the appeal of the team to players in the draft &amp; FA.  We never got to see him go from acquiring assets to consolidating the assets into a contender and making a roster where the players fit together.  I think most Hinkie supporters give him the benefit of the doubt here though since he worked under Daryl Morey."
"Cool, so I’m curious. What trade value do you think he has? Who can the 6ers get for him? Book? Trae? Jamal Murray? Barrett? Wiggins? PG13? Jrue Holiday?"
"I'll give you that but the Sixers had Jrue Holiday &amp; a lot of trash when the tanking started. Maybe if they had Lowry &amp; DeRozan they would have been able to build a team.  Hey, if Philly hired Ujiri in 2013, things might be different. He did a good job turning the team that Colangelo left into something good. Hinkie took over a year after Philly traded almost every asset they had for Andrew f'n Bynum."
"If the Suns can knock off the Clips, I don't even care who wins this year. Toronto and the Thunder are my teams, so I'm just vibing.  -CP3 has always been my fav PG since Nash retired, Book is my favorite shooting guard since Kobe retired,   -Trae is a badass villain  -I love Jrue Holiday and I wouldn't mind seeing all that homegrown talent get a chip down in Wisconsin after all their cursed sport moments in the last couple years."
"Lets be real. They also drafted Noel and Okafor.   The team drafted Simmons, Fultz, Okafor and draft night trade for Noel.  They are lucky as hell that they drafted 3rd when they drafted Embid or they would have drafted Wiggins or Parker I bet.  They traded Jrue Holiday for Noel. 2 picks later could have had Brown and Tatum.  Booker instead of Okafor.  The number of busts it feels like they have had super high in the draft...  Holiday, Tatum, Brown, Booker, Embid...."
"&gt;Hinkie turned Jrue Holiday into Noel &amp; a future 1st.  ""hinkie turned a future all star into a bust and a shitty pick""  im guessing this sounded far better in your head."
"You really need to do some research man...  Noel was picked by New Orleans. Hinkie turned Jrue Holiday into Noel &amp; a future 1st. That future 1st was traded for Saric &amp; another future 1st. Colangelo dumped Noel for nothing when he took over. He's actually still a solid backup center.  You left out MCW who won rookie of the year but was never really a complete player. Hinkie traded him for a 1st somehow too.  Yeah Embiid dropped because of his injury. Obviously if he's healthy he goes #1 or #2. The consensus top 3 were Wiggins, Embiid &amp; Parker. They definitely got lucky to avoid the other 2.  Okafor was a bad pick but probably made because Embiid's injury wasn't healing. The rest of the top 10 in 2015 was pretty bad (Porzingis, Hezonja, Cauley-Stein, Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Kaminsky, Winslow). Booker is the best pick of that draft but nobody was taking him at #3.  Maybe stop with the hot takes and actually do some research next time pal."
I disagree with you writing Jrue off defending Trae this quickly. That’s going to be the key of the series and I think he legit has a chance of keeping up on that end. Offensively Holiday will probably be too tired to do that much though
Yeah I hope hawks don't try to stick Trae on jrue. Holiday will absolutely feast
I’ll take Bucks. Trae is the Hawks only real shot creator and he’ll be facing a similar level of defense in Jrue Holiday that he just faced with Brick Simmons. I’ll take Middleton and Giannis to have big series since no one will be able to stop Giannis and Hunter is hurt so no one to realistically check Middleton either.
What? Luka is a decent defender bro sure he’s no Jrue Holiday but he’s not a negative on that end like Trae or Seth Curry.
"Assuming Giannis doesn’t count for rising to the occasion, I’ll say jrue Holiday. He’ll play good defense on Trae, and hit big shots.  I don’t know if anyone on the Hawks can disappoint, they weren’t expected to be here everything for them is a success. I do think Collins will have a hard time with Giannis and Lopez in the paint, so him I guess."
"The Process needs to get more flak for the misses they had over the years.  Sure Simmons and Embiid are nice, but they swung and missed on a *lot* of lottery picks and/or solid veterans that are not on the team anymore.  Markelle Fultz (#1), Ben Simmons (#1), Evan Turner (#2), Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), Elfrid Payton (#10), Michale Carter Williams (#11), Nikola Vucevic (#16), Thad Young (#12), ~~Jrue Holiday (#17)~~ Nerlens Noel (#6)"
Jrue was huge. I'm playing  Love jrue Holiday. Emptied the clip
"The draft is random, which is why you don't field adult league teams in the NBA for it. And lo and behold, the beginning of the process (Jrue Holiday) made the ECF before Philly did"
"Lol Danny Ferry got forced out by the league for racial remarks—before Schlenk, I didn’t think the Hawks would ever find a better GM. He was literally the only one who had Giannis on his radar before a front office leak. The Sixers had a young Vucevic and Jrue Holiday to work with. The Hawks had a whole roster of bad contracts and expiring veterans."
Jrue Holiday in a bad way. Ayton has been way better than I thought he would be this post season; stopped settling for those jumpers and bam he’s been amazing
Has anyone else been impressed with how good Reggie Jackson has been playing all playoffs? Dude got paid the minimum contract and is playing like an all star. I think he played better than Jrue holiday so far in the playoffs.
Sorry instead of a championship roster to start with we had Jrue Holiday and Evan Turner
"The big knock on Trae Young is that he's an abysmal defender and in the playoffs teams will be able to gameplan and hunt him.   In the first two rounds of the playoffs, he's gotten lucky, going against the Knicks, who don't really have a great point guard to go at Trae with, and the 76ers have...Ben Simmons. That being said, Derrick Rose and Seth Curry each both had really great series against the Hawks.   The Bucks are going to go at Trae hard with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton, and I think the Hawks, especially without DeAndre Hunter, are going to have a really hard time defending the Bucks in this series.   tldr -- Trae's biggest weakness, his defense, hasn't really gotten exposed yet this playoffs, but probably will against the Bucks."
Also the Jrue piece is relevant since Jrue Holiday is now in the ECF before the Sixers were. Trading a 23 year old after an all-star season is quite unusual.
That still doesn’t address the spacing issue the 76ers have. DeMar a bit older also. It’s not like trading for Jrue Holiday or CP3.
Sixers gotta be sick knowing CP3 and Jrue Holiday were available last summer
He literally plays with Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday but go off
"Don’t let the Nets series fool you, they would’ve taken any team to 7 based on how Durant shot from the field. It’s also pretty disappointing to see people refer to Middleton/Holiday as “meh” 2nd and 3rd options, even though you just had the opportunity to see Tobias Harris play. Look up Middleton’s averages and ask if you’re comfortable calling him meh. Jrue has a lot of room for improvement, hopefully he gets going."
He did outplay by him lol. Not to mention he’s getting defended by jrue holiday instead of Trae/Gallo.
"Trae saw Jrue Holiday yesterday and thought ""i'mma do that too"""
The Jrue Holiday in game7 special
jrue holiday is a good offensive player tho...
Jrue holiday?
"Also know as the jrue holiday special, nobody care how bad you were as long as you show up in the clutch."
Trae Young     Khris Middleton    Jrue Holiday     🤝 Nobody will remember how poorly I shot in Game 7 🤝
Jrue Holiday can. He has kinda sucked in these playoffs but I mean there’s not many PG’s that would succeed with Bud’s offensive gameplan
Shades of Jrue Holiday
"If the Hawks win this game, nobody is going to care about how poorly Trae played, he can still salvage this, just like Jrue Holiday last night."
Trae young choking worse than jrue holiday
trae young is jrue holiday v2
Trae doing his best Jrue Holiday impression out here shooting 2/16 from the field
Lol the entire right side of the court was wide open for his signature mid range jumper. He was being guarded by jrue holiday and had the height advantage on the drive as well. Not to mention that the Nets also had a timeout to call and both the coach and the player could have used said timeout. That last possession was just bad basketball.   So it’s looking like you actually don’t know shit about basketball but go on my man.
"Against a 6’9” dead knees 32 year old Blake Griffin lmao, not really comparable to PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday while being the only source of offense. Giannis was great in the series but did basically nothing in the clutch, that was all Middleton and Jrue."
"Let him keep it. It’s a sign he’s not a u/kd-is-not-a-snake burner (everyone keeps accusing him of being one lol, especially that weirdo u/RapsAreChamps_Suckit.)   KD would never switch his Jrue Holiday flair for an Bledsoe flair, even on an alt"
Plus Ayton looks like jrue holiday compared to gobert with his much superior perimeter defence
Bucks legend jrue holiday
All night like this. Look at Jrue Holiday on Bucks last possession in regulation. He gets mugged by Griffin. No call.
Went from Jrue Bledsoe to Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday 5/23
&gt; Everyone else on that list is just worse than Holiday. Like unquestionably worse.      The entire purpose of trading Bledsoe was that you can sag off him in the playoffs and he won't punish you. The Nets literally just did that exact same thing to Jrue and he couldn't punish them. I have faith in everyone I listed punishing defenses that help off of them.      &gt;Dude is first team all-defence this year. None of these guys come close to that.      I just don't think that matters at all. Bledsoe also made several All Defense teams and he got traded. The Bucks issue is not with their defense at all. Like 0%. The defense will still be great if you replace Jrue with anyone I listed.        The Bucks offense barely squeaked by a very bad defensive team. They need to give up defense for offense or else they'll just continue to fail.
"way she goes, but jrue holiday and khris middleton shat the bed almost all game and giannis still kept it close enough to pull out the win against one of the best players of all time (who just scored THE MOST POINTS IN A GAME 7 in nba history)"
"The three best Milwaukee defenders are Giannis, Jrue, and Tucker. KD is such an offensive phenom that defending him is exhausting, and usually requires the speed of a small. So what happened?  * Giannis was essentially Milwaukees's only offensive weapon, and he was burning every bit of energy he had doing it. While he can dedicate more energy to defense, no one out there was making up for what they would lose on offense. As gassed as KD was at the end, Giannis was worse (to the point of announcers questioning his health as he struggled to breath even before the 4th, let alone OT). Combine that with Giannis not being fast enough to contend with KD's lateral speed while moving backwards, he isn't the best choice to put on a KD that only needs 2, especially if you're going to need Giannis to potentially bounce back and surge to regain the lead if KD scores.  * Jrue is fast enough to keep up on defense, but he wasn't physical enough and he was getting beat badly, and he was burning fouls trying to contain Harden and Harris (fairly effectively).  * PJ is fast enough to keep up, mostly, and physical enough to make KD work for it it consistently, helping ensure KD was exhausted and his efficiency was limited (only good to great, rather than the unmatchable he's capable of). Sure, KD is still going to ball, you can't prevent that. All you can do is slow and exhaust enough that your own team has a shot at keeping up, and that's what Milwaukee did. PJ also basically expended every drop of energy he had guarding KD, and he's basically the only Buck they could afford to lose on offense knowingly (Holiday and Middleton bad games withstanding)."
"They did overpay, though Jrue is certainly better than Bledsoe.   Still, Holiday did not have a good game."
"Middleton went thermonuclear in game 6 and Jrue Holiday scored the game tying buckets to send us to OT last night. Sure they have bad games, but I forgive them."
Uhh jrue holiday?
"Lets think about this logically for a second OP.   One of them was so bad, he was routinely being left open. The other was getting full court pressed by jrue fucking holiday. What do you think the difference was?"
Was Jrue Holiday playing with a grade 2 hamstring strain? Harden couldn't even play the way he normally does
Jrue Holiday isn't immune to screens.  By far the most important guy in PnR defense is the one guarding the roll-man. The one guarding the ball-handler is usually out of the play.
Jrue Holiday says no
Jrue Holiday is the best teammate he's had . Also the stars aligned w Brooklyn and Injuries

They also called a foul for KD towards the end of the 4th on Jrue holiday playing perfect textbook defense. KD getting the Harden treatment.
"The Bucks play in slow motion. Like other than Giannis, you've got old man PJ, giant Brook Lopez, methodical Middleton, and plays in slow motion for some reason Jrue Holiday. How many of those guys are slashing? Maybe sometimes Middleton. Holiday surveys the court and looks for those openings, but he doesn't just put his head down too often and go.  This game, in particular, because the starters basically NEVER came out, it actually paid off in some ways. The Bucks still had some energy at the end."
I think with Jrue Holiday on Seth their spacing will be abysmal and the Sixers offence will fall apart.
"You say that as if Jrue Holiday isn't on the team and that it's a big two in Milwaukee and not a big three.  Yeah Nets were a super team when all three of them were healthy. But this series was over once Kyrie went down and it was obvious by Harden not being able to even run that he was rushed back.   But yeah totally dude. Giannis beating KD, Bruce Brown, old man Blake, Joe Harris, and crippled Harden encapsulates the greatest and most impressive run since Dirk."
Jrue Holiday would have been bledsoe 2.0 in history book if we lost
"He ended with 22/9/9 this game with 10/10 from the line.  That’s definitely better than what Mike James would’ve done. As annoying as it is, his foul drawing also put the bucks in foul trouble and put the nets in the bonus earlier.  Also, as poorly as he shot (29.4%), he still was more efficient than Jrue Holiday (21.7%). His true shooting is also helped by his perfect free throws."
"Some coaches, not all. Also, that's Jrue Holiday, smaller but quicker defender that averages 1.6 steals a game... it's easier for KD to pull up on him than drive."
"""2 points isn't 2 points. It's a lie. 2 points is not 2 points. I'll explain it to you later. Coaches have said that for years, but 2 points is not 2 points"" - Jrue ""Khris ""LeBron James"" Middleton"" Holiday."
With Jrue Holiday on defense too lol
And Jrue Holiday was silencing the haters in the final minutes of the 4th. He looked like KD out there. But Giannis not getting the rebound and Lopez looking cross eyed after the inbound pass ruined that little moment.
"He was absolutely atrocious in the first 3 quarters but showed do much heart in the 4th. Hard to hate Jrue, dude is just a baller all around. I love all the Holiday brothers tbh."
"Lmao. U really dont like giving Giannis credit. Even if Harden wasn’t as good as he normally is (even though he almost had a triple double but whatever), Kevin Durant was the second coming of Jesus Christ this series, and Giannis beat him.  Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday actively shit the bed as well as Bud running terrible plays like he was trying to go home. The Nets had like 4 of the best 5 performances this game and Giannis came out on top. Oh, Blake Griffin also played great defense and had some clutch buckets and PJ Tucker fouled out in OT. Giannis still wins.   Idc what happened with Harden, Giannis is a clutch player and nothing casuals say will change the fact that he showed tf up today. Yall will come up with every excuse before admitting that he proved the haters wrong today"
&gt;This was SUPPOSED to be an easy series  This is some pure revisionist bullshit lmao. Did you forget when Kareem literally said that the Bucks didn’t have what it takes? Remember everyone counting them out after G5? Remember when they went down 0-2? If you still try to discredit Giannis after this game ur just a hater at this point.   I love how he dropped 40/13/5 and carried K mid and Jrue Holiday who seemed like they were actively trying to go home and he is *still* getting shit on 😂
"For the Sixers, Lopez makes Embiid come out of the paint unless they put Gallinari or Collins on him, in which case he could dominate down low on them, but they have other bodies in there capable of slowing down Giannis. The Hawks have no answer for Giannis but the Bucks would also have trouble defending the Hawks. For the Sixers I think it's a gritty defensive series and for the Hawks it's more offensive. And since the Bucks are a more defensive team I think the Hawks would give them more trouble. Defensively for the Sixers you would probably have Tucker Guarding Simmons since Jrue might have some trouble with him, whereas Tucker locks him up all series, then probably Middleton on Harris so Giannis can stay help side while Lopez guards Embiid, that leaves Holiday who can easily contain either Green or Korkmaz although he would probably end up guarding Simmons if PJ gets in foul trouble. For the Hawks you have PJ and Jrue switching between guarding Trae so they dont get in foul trouble but the rest idk"
Jrue went from a “John Starks” game to a “Gutsy Jrue Holiday” game just like that.   And I’m happy for him. He had a tough series and a tough game. Didn’t want him to go out like that!
"Around 5 min nets up 4. Harden slack on defense. Holiday hit a 3 bc harden slacking. At 4:32 harden hasna turnover , giannas makes a easy layup bc harden doesn't rotate after Blake helped ( this it the play blake tell directly at harden while throwing his hands up.   Then he makes a 3.  Then once again he is lazy in defense which leads k-mid hitting a 3m  Then jrue takes over for like 7 straight."
"Jrue ""I don't wanna go on a"" Holiday"
"This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but even though Jrue Holiday struggled shooting the ball all game, he showed up when it mattered most. Before this he hit a clutch 3 (not sure whether it was the 4th or OT) was playmaking on the offensive end. Sucks he couldn’t make anything, but he really made up for it in my opinion down the stretch."
"You mainly don't call time when you see a favorable mismatch and don't want the opposing team to set up.  KD had Jrue on him and while Holiday is a great defender, he's still a mismatch (understatement when you're up against KD).  Nash trusted his players and KD was just gassed."
"Juneteenth became a holiday  Jrue Holiday  There’s only one connection to make, and it’s a straight line."
"Almost tempted to replace Holiday with Tucker with the way Jrue has been shooting, but nah. It's not like Tucker is shooting that well either."
1. CP3 2. Jrue Holiday 3. E'Twaun Moore 4. Langston Galloway 5. Axel Toupane 6. N/A
Yea it was the perfect storm of a clear upgrade and part of the pitch to keep Giannis. I’m high on Jrue Holiday but I’d trade him for Dame in a heartbeat for example.
Khris has the highest defensive win shares in the postseason. 2nd is giannis. Then Jrue holiday then Dante D.
agree! and only ones who disagree are prob bucks fans. I love Jrue holiday and thought his offensive ability was super underrated…this postseason his offense has been downright abysmal. Great defense and not a net negative but my god…especially w that contract
Oh God... Jrue Holiday
"Really dude, FVV is one of the best PG defenders in the league. All defense teams aren't a great indicator of who the best defenders are, voters really aren't good at rating them due to defensive metrics being pretty bad and most having no idea how to judge off ball defence. E.g. Jrue Holiday making it just 2x before this year or Westbrook constantly getting votes for all defence.  Giving multiple guys from the same team all defence is very very rare and voters tend to spread it out a lot.   I think Siakam was absolutely a top 10 defender, so was Kawhi. Danny Green made all defence just 2 years ago and looked even better in 2019. Lowry is a known great defender.   That team looks like it was designed in a lab for switching playoff basketball. Siakam and Kawhi can guard 1-4/5, Lowry and FVV can guard pretty much any 1-2 and absolutely hounded GSW shooters over multiple screens. And all of these players have high defensive IQ with a creative defensive coach. Not sure I can really think of a playoff defence that was better than them in the past 15 years."

It’s suns versus bucks - that jrue holiday winning bucket versus  nets changed nba history
Well it’s hard to go to the paint with a bum ankle when you have Jrue Holiday and Giannis always guarding the screen man you see
I'd consider this guy more valuable than a lot of team's 3rd options. Jrue Holiday is probably one of the better 3rd options in the league and is making 25 mill this year with a BPM of 3.5/ VORP of 2.6. This hypothetical player + an average player's BPM would be easily be 4.0+ with a VORP to match.
"For comparison, here's the list of key players who missed  games in the 2015 playoffs due to injury. (I chose this year at random, but it may have been an outlier as well)  *Stars/Borderline Stars*  * John Wall * Pau Gasol * Kevin Love * Kyrie Irving * Rojon Rondo * Jrue Holiday * Chris Paul * Mike Conley  *Key Role Players:*  * Andrew Bogut * Tony Allen * Kyle Korver * JR Smith"
Jrue Holiday has been sneaky disappointing/bad. Better than Bledsoe but his offense has cratered in this playoffs.
Marv is about to nominate Jrue Holiday as series MVP after watching him drop 38 points and carry in the 4th
Chris Paul will enjoy exposing Jrue Holiday
"Have you not been watching the same jrue holiday that I have been, who has been getting exposed on the switch literally all game?"
Jrue Holiday is such a massive upgrade over Bledsoe
why the fuck u pass the ball to the guy that Jrue Holiday guard?
"Kris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are so inconsistent, only one of them gets a good game while other one has a terrible Game. One will shot in 50% on one night the other guy shoots in 10 or 20%."
Time for jrue holiday to step up
Jrue Holiday is fucking terrible. Good thing his ass is getting carried by Khris and Giannis.
Jrue holiday has been a letdown today
Is Jrue Holiday really that big of an upgrade over Eric Bledsoe?
Oh you thought Jrue Holiday is an upgrade to Bledsoe?
Jrue Holiday might be a good player overall but he is a terrible point guard.
"Jrue Holiday: “please don’t huert me Kvon, please!”"
Jrue Holiday is clearly the worst PG left in the playoffs and it may cost the title for the bucks.
"Looks like Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday is back tonight"
Jrue holiday has been so so bad I can’t believe this game is “close” even though I’m very confident the hawks will win
Jrue Holiday is playing like an AI in the rec tonight
Yo Jrue Holiday is ass
Jrue taking a holiday with these drives
"Jrue Holiday beside me? Nah, I’m superstar sharpshooter Bobby Portis, I got this"
Lmao Jrue Holiday had that “between the two of us Bobby I’m the one that should be taking that shot” look
Jrue Holiday like wtf was that
"I really don’t see what Milwaukee can offer. Any Dame trade will be centred around a high upside young player and multiple future picks, which the Bucks don’t have either of. Portland doesn’t have any use for Jrue Holiday, they’d be looking to rebuild."
"&gt; If you only take basketball comparisons, the Turkish League, BBL, Australian league, Liga ACB, Argentina, China, **anywhere you want where there is no draft system,** year after year the bottom of the table is different. Teams with far less help from the league than the NBA gives, with far fewer resources than their rivals, improve and get off the bottom because that's what happens in competition.  Key words bolded: THERE IS NO DRAFT SYSTEM. With no draft system, you can get more creative because you have to and sign anyone you wantto- and even beyond that, it needs to be mentioned that in other countries teams have academies of their own, so a top soccer team can go further to ""I was at the playground and this one kid looked REALLY good in a game, I invited him to our academy so we can get him before anyone else.""  That will NEVER HAPPEN in the USA, because even with academies, no matter how deep the scouting gets, no team will bell the cat of signing a third grader with high ratings to join their academy, to sign a first-grader, or go as far as ""you're the star of the NBA team, she's the star of our connected WNBA team- donate sperm to her so we can have a baby that has a good chance of being a mega-star""...and because the draft system works, it means another team can just say ""nice prospect you have in the Academy...we have a higher pick than you. YOINK!"" (which is similar to the transfer system, only worse since the opposing team won't have to compensate the team losing the prospect and the team remains hopeless. Even if you say ""give the team $5 million for the prospect"", it won't come from the salary cap and so it's ""take the five million, find some more prospects, see them plucked away from you, and the losing team can't even use that $5 million to get another player.""    &gt; There are always new teams that utterly implode, get complacent or slowly decay under bad management. There are always teams that become more than the sum of their parts, breakout stars you didn't expect, older players who show they've still got it, or coaches who change a clubs fortunes. There are always good players and coaches who go to bad teams and turn them around. There is always change. &gt;  &gt; The situation you're describing does not happen. Even in leagues where small teams get 0 help, they find ways to get better than utterly abject. Teams far more outmatched than anyone in the NBA.  Basketball is not soccer, no matter how much you think it is. Yes, there's a chance of a Leicester City miracle once in a hundred years, but if you take it to the NBA, the only teams to succeed who can even be considered close to what you're describing are the 2004 Pistons (who needed Shaq and Kobe to dissolve to win the title) and the 2018 Raptors (and they needed Kawhi to become available to get over the hump...meaning they needed an All-Star to be dropped in their laps too!)    &gt; No NBA teams are in Punxsutawney. They're absolutely big enough and wealthy enough to not be hopeless every year without a bailout. They would not have ""no help"", the league still helps them plenty. They aren't children, they are large adult sons, and they are perfectly capable of standing on their own two feet when their failure is no longer indulged and encouraged.  Doesn't matter which city it is, because ultimately we know now which cities NBA players would prefer to play in. Milwaukee may not be Punxutawney, but they still needed to sell the farm for a fringe star like Jrue Holiday because even having Giannis, accepted as the best player alive right now, no one of any value wants to live in Milwaukee- and if they didn't sell the farm, Giannis would have run to a better city. And the same will happen for Lamelo in Charlotte when it occurs.  *And that's with a draft.* Take this away, and yes, teams WOULD be hopeless every year without a bailout, because teams in the have not cities have to overpay fringe players to get them to agree to live in that city for four years, they have basically no hope except hope a good pick lands in their laps and they can crest within six years before they leave for a bigger city. Take even THAT hope away, and you WILL absolutely see teams fold within a few years of falling into the lowest tier, simply because it will become better to contract the team, ask for an expansion team in the same city, and hope the new team has a chance in hell."
That was when I actually found out how old Jrue Holiday is
"Mike Conley missed a singular game against the Warriors, and it was only game 1 my guy. Jrue Holiday played all but game 2. These injuries do not compare to Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and Jamal Murray."
"""...Back in 2015, the Warriors were basically billed as a three-time lotto winner -- to the point that plenty of people STILL put somewhat of an asterisk by that title -- because they faced injured opponents along the way. Jrue Holiday missed the first round for New Orleans. Mike Conley missed the second round for Memphis. Most notably, LeBron's Cavaliers were without Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving (for all but Game 1) in the Finals. """
A good one but not an amazing one and AD still beasted in 2018. Jrue Holiday and Rondo as your two best players is not gonna cut it  Ik he is better but would you consider Kevin Garnett a 1st option type player even tho he missed the playoffs 3 straight years on Minnesota?
"The best measure is through a coaches and players survey. For the coach, which player often breaks up and anticipates their plays. I remember there were a couple of seasons in his time with the Spurs when whomever Kawhi was guarding, that player would go to the corner so that Kawhi won’t be near the play that was being executed. Saw that many times.  For the players, they know who makes them uncomfortable or who makes them work for their points more. For many years now, guards have been saying Jrue Holiday. In Kobe’s time, it was Tony Allen.  This is why the best measure is by surveying both the coaches and the players. It should not be decided by the media, stat sheets, or fans."
"So in a hypothetical world if the Suns move on and then Jrue Holiday gets hurt and Giannis goes out, would you be ok with people saying that ring really has no credence?"
Only 1 jrue holiday though so I’d imagine one of the two will have tough games
Can't imagine how badly Chris Paul or Devin Booker will look against Jrue Holiday if they get to the Finals.
Jrue Holiday: “I take full responsibility for what happened tonight … I will be better.”
Shit Skip and Shannon were going in on the Bucks for a half hour about how you can’t let trae young get 48 and 11. Either he gets to score or he gets to play make but not both. Then said “should Jrue Holiday score less to defend trae more.”   Answer: why not do both.
"13% of the Bucks plays during the post season have been isolation plays. Clippers are at 14%, Hawks &amp; Suns at 7%  I take your point that it's more isolation than you'd like but pretending that's all they run is just facetious.  Budenholzer has always had a rep as a defensive coach.  Heres a good bit on the Bucks offensive improvements from the Miami series [clicky](https://behindthebuckpass.com/2021/05/28/milwaukee-bucks-mike-budenholzer-pushing-right-buttons-postseason/)  &gt;On the offensive end, we’ve seen the team play with much more structure and motion than a season ago. Rather than using Giannis Antetokounmpo as the primary ball handler on most possessions in the half-court, the Bucks have been increasingly using him more frequently as a screener or roller in pick-and-roll situations with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton.  &gt;The team has also been setting more off-ball screens away from the main play to create room for shooters and cutters. This has created more space for players to get open shots at the rim in the corners or above the break spots. This has especially benefited guys like Bryn Forbes, whose dynamic shooting ability has given the team something they sorely lacked in their past two post-season trips.  &gt;Three other areas that the Bucks have found success on offense is through their more aggressive ball movement, greater use of transition, especially in secondary transition opportunities and a clear intent to attack mismatches when they create them."
Bucks fucked up letting Brogdon go but they showed they would go all-in with the Jrue Holiday trade. OKC never did that with KD and was trying to fill the role player slots with fresh draft picks like Mitch McGary and Josh Huestis...
He was an excellent defender at the guard position but even elite guard defenders are a clear couple tiers below elite big men in terms of defensive impact. It would be like Jrue Holiday winning DPOY over Gobert or Giannis.
Jrue Holiday cherry picking was hilarious - gosh he's my favroite Bucks player

"Also you thankfully had to deal with Ben Simmons offense, not Jrue Holiday"
They can just feed him lines though. I haven’t watched a lot in awhile but last time I saw a clip he was saying jrue holiday was the X factor in the Milwaukee matchup over trae and also completely misunderstood how ben Simmons is utilized. I’m sure he can regurgitate talking points but sometimes it feels like he ad libs and it feels very obvious he didn’t watch…
ATL Hawks Jrue Holiday &gt; BKN Nets Jrue Holiday
Trae Young kept holding his followthrough after every three. Jrue Holiday started sprinting back down the court every time he did it and got a couple easy baskets.
Jrue Holiday was the biggest hero of all. Guy is fuckin unreal as a defender and quietly great offensively. Love this guys game and miss him as a 76ers fan. I hope the Bucks win it all
"I mean. Listen, when we’re in close games and PJ is 0-4 in 34 minutes I’m pretty mad about it, especially that Game 5 against Brooklyn because he wasn’t doing a lot on defense either.    But…. He is one of the biggest differences for the Bucks this season. PJ, Bobby Portis, and Jrue Holiday."
[Picture of Jrue Holiday in the locker room](http://imgur.com/gallery/WJnUD)
"Jrue ""why ya hitting yourself"" Holiday."
"Jrue Holiday did exactly what he should have done in Game 1; full court press Trae the entire game.   Giannis did exactly what he should have done in Game 1; pounded the paint. Clint Capela can’t stop him and the Hawks don’t have the bodies to build a wall. Even if they did collapse, Giannis can dish out backward to Khris or Jrue or Lopez or Patty Con or Bobby Buckets and make it happen."
The love for Jrue Holiday from [these Bucks fans](https://streamable.com/d6rfs3) is really getting out of control.
Ay Bucks sub Jrue and Holiday out now.
Jrue Holiday looks like himself again.
the Jrue Holiday redemption game
"Hawks aren’t shooting well and have had a lot of turnovers. Giannis is being aggressive and doing well scoring in the paint, Lopez and jrue holiday have been tacking on a decent amount of points as well"
Jrue Holiday heard y'all called him bledsoe
Jrue Holiday.  So hot right now. Jrue.
"Jrue fucking Holiday man  One game he's like Eric Bledsoe, and tonight he's like MJ"
and stood flat-footed admiring his bricked 3s letting Jrue Holiday leak out for a couple of uncontested lay-ups
Jrue Holiday becoming prime Steph is a very unfortunate turn of events for the Hawks
jrue holiday looking like prime 1989 isaiah thomas wtf
Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday is a much better basketball player than Trae Young
This is the Jrue Holiday I remember from 2K.
JRUE FUCKIN HOLIDAY
Jrue Holiday leaking out on Trae 3s is such a great move on their end
Jrue Holiday leaking out the back has happened far too many times and this needs to be addressed next game. Trae needs to get back quicker
Bobby Portis and Jrue Holiday need to do a staring  contest with those crazy eyes
Would you say Gary Payton is like a shorter Jrue Holiday?
jrUE hOliDaY iS bAD
Holiday is a bum lmaoooo. Imagine trading your picks for jrue holiday to shit up the court
Jrue holiday is trash - so overhyped
I’m sorry but I don’t see Kawhi and PG at their age and health being better perimeter defenders than Ben Simmons and Jrue Holiday. Not to mention once Trae got past them he had to meet elite rim protectors Giannis and Embiid at the paint. Why are y’all acting like these are terrible defenses lmao
"The problem was it was only AD and Jrue Holiday since Boogie had the ACL tear, and Boogie was basically a top 10-15 player at that time. Plus, Blazers didn’t even win 1 game"
"Lmao the nonsensical arguments that Luka stans make are hilarious. Trae's primary defender against the Sixers was 1st team all defense, DPOY runner up Simmons. Now his primary defender is 1st team all defense Jrue Holiday."
Says the Milwaukee fan. How’s the effort to get Giannis another star free agent? Jrue Holiday the best you can get?
"I'm happy the Hawks won Wednesday - I'm unhappy that Jrue Holiday got so many open looks, and I would like that cleaned up tonight, but even if it's not, I expect the Hawks to win.  Hawks leadership is happy the Hawks won Wednesday - they're unhappy that Giannis is the only player on the court who takes more than 10 seconds on free throws, but even if that rule isn't enforced, I'm sure they expect the Hawks to win."
"30yo Vucevic went for 2 first and WCJ, 30yo Jrue Holiday on an expiring deal went for 3 first, 2 swaps and a bad contract   Simmons is 24, has 4 years left and was an All-Star 3 times, he's not getting traded just for Rubio and Beasley who is in jail rn."
"I'm surprised by how little attention has been paid to ""what that little guard name?"" when referring to Jrue Holiday.  That had me screaaaaaming laughing."
Nobody:   JVG: Can’t wait to see Jrue Holiday guard Trae Young tomorrow
“Jrue Holiday is the real deal defensively”. Trae had 48 on his head. JVG your so stupid. That’s why no team wants you as coach
I also see tons of people calling Jrue Holiday clutch for hitting these shots so finally now get out of here with your own bullshit.
NOP will only get 2 extra first round picks. Albeit in 2025 and 2027 so its further down the road than I thought.  But you know what would have helped NOP more? Jrue Holiday
"First of all, you started off the thread with the following asinine take:  &gt; Or we got unlucky he hadn’t hit many earlier. Depends how little credit you want to give us I guess.  Nobody should've entertained your victim complex after this. But somebody ventured to do it, so I'm taking the time to break down exactly how you're evading OP's point.  KD is expected to take that shot in those circumstances. He's 6'11"", he's the most unguardable scorer on the planet and nobody can get a proper contest in. Him hitting that shot is not so much luck as it is practice. 96% of KD's mid-range makes are 'contested'. Its not an impossible shot by KD standards and you're selling him short by denying that. What's more, OP wrote this  &gt; the bucks got lucky that jrue finally hit a shot and KD's feet were in the wrong place.  Which means that the actual thing he's calling lucky is his foot placement, and this is how the average fan of other NBA teams views the situation.  Jrue Holiday was off all night despite being left open for several shots. That he went and made a couple of shots that he generated on his own was against the run of the play and lucky in the sense that he doesn't do it at a rate or with the consistency that wins you games. The timing of his shots was pretty fucking lucky."
"So to be clear, “Jrue Holiday hitting a couple of shots in the fourth quarter isn’t luck, he’s just a good player” is a homer take to you?  Again, we’re not talking injuries here. Obviously that was a lucky break for us. But as far as the actual games that were played go, you want to claim the Bucks are lucky because Jrue went 5/23 but a couple of those shots were in the fourth, while KD hitting a 23 foot turnaround fadeaway with time pressure and a hand in his face is also lucky for us because it wasn’t 24 feet and not lucky for them that he hit an impossible shot even by his standards in the first place?  Use your brain."
Jrue “The Little Guy” Holiday
"If I had to guess, Steph goes to the Bucks or Sixers to team up with Giannis or Embiid if he leaves. The Warriors would get back Jrue Holiday or Ben Simmons to use either for their franchise or to get back more assets."
"Holiday was pretty bad on d. Post game Shaq and kenny/chuck were arguing between Jrue getting shook vs no help for Jrue.   They way he was playing trae made it seem like he was expecting help, but then watching the rest of the team the scheme to drop back was clear.   Obviously as a pels fan I’ve seen what Jrue can do, ie dame Lillard, but is trae on another level or was that just over gambling by Jrue?"
"I believe you as an old head. Hedging is an old defensive gameplan that has its flaws in today’s NBA. The main one is that guards are just to quick and too good shooters for Brook Lopez to hedge. All Trae has to do is clear the screen and there’s no way in hell Lopez makes it back to Collins or keeps up with Trae.  The drop coverage is used mainly for slow bigs when Icing the screen. Jrue has to try and force Young away from the screen and stay above the screen to take away the 3pt shot. Portis is there to contain the drive.  Technically, Shaq was right in that Holiday should be forcing Young away from the screen and into Portis instead of fighting over the top. But also Portis is just way too far off to provide any sort of resistance to Young anyways, so it’s just a collapse from both players"
"&gt; And it’s pretty fucking clear it was never seriously considered.   Lol you don’t know that at all. As far as you know, Giannis might take a 2nd round exit next year and request a trade. That’s not even that crazy of a scenario and you guys mortgaged your future to bring in Jrue Holiday who apparently forgot how to play basketball on offense… enough incompetence and it’s not that far fetched to think Giannis could request a trade out."
"Murray caps out at about Jrue Holiday, which is just shy of a franchise player. Jrue is an amazing player and any franchise would be lucky to have him, but if you don't have an established #1 or even #2 ahead of him, your team isn't  a championship caliber team. Unless you go Pistons style and your whole starting lineup are borderline Allstars.   White is probably a 6th man on a championship team. He's very good at a lot of things but he's not an elite defender, facilitator, or scorer and you probably want your starting guard to be at least one of those things. He can spot start for a really good team but I'd say any team starting white is a lower level playoff team most likely.   Both are getting paid great contracts for their value, if San Antonio is looking to move Murray they could possibly get  New Orlean's #10 pick.   Idk what the value of White is via trade but a team looking for stability in their guard rotation would love him. My Celtics would love him if Fournier leaves. I could see Cleveland wanting him if they wanted to move one of their guards. With Bev being old and washed and Jackson possibly looking for a bigger payday, I could see the Clippers wanting White to support Leonard and George. He's honestly such a good complimentary player I'm sure half the league would love to have him, if the price is right."
"i think both of the non-jrue holiday brothers in the nba are there, or were at one point this season."
Did you see how many picks the Bucks gave up for Jrue Holiday? He was supposed to be that one more star...
Holiday shot 1 shot less than Giannis and Khris had like 16 or something. They had their chances. Jrue shot 9 times in the first quarter. Bucks tried to get them going.      Khris needs to just shoot more tho.
Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton
Jrue Holiday = Jew Holiday = Hannukah
The truth is Giannis needs one more big star with him. Jrue Holiday and Chris Middleton are not going to cut it. I hope I'm wrong being a Milwaukee fan but from what I've seen so far we just can't stop the deadeye shooting of Phoenix. If Milwaukee had one great shooting guard that could really put up some big points and plays good defense. Giannis can't do it all on his own.
This narrative is silly to me.  Game 1 Giannis played bad and Middleton was forced to jack up 24ish shots iirc.   Most Bucks games I’ve watched lately seems like Khris is forced to take over in the 4th because Giannis has a severely limited game and just cruises in the 4th. That was the story for game 1 for me.  Game 2 Giannis actually played great though and nobody else showed up.   The biggest problem so far has been Jrue Holiday though. Giannis has to be there in the 4th too.
Are we sure Jrue Holiday isn't from Singapore
"Watching Giannis handle the ball is like playing NBA2K21 Rec. When you have a ball handler who can barely shoot, and needs to get most points by driving into the paint, it throws off a lot of his teammates.   What I mean is Giannis is looking to mainly score when he has the ball at the top of the key, his teammates get cold when they stand around, try to find their spots, or get their shots, while Giannis ruins the momentum for the team.   Good example is when Giannis was out, and Jrue Holiday was able to facilitate the ball better, get buckets, get his teammates involved at the right time, because they expect it.   Back to NBA2K21, I don't expect much people to understand since most ""PG"" ball handlers are exactly like Giannis, they're either a slasher that just hogs the ball and gets to the rim every chance they get, and when they do pass to you, it's unexpected. The other type is playmaking shot creator's who state at their controllers trying to do dribble moves and just shoot. Those are the worst since they pass to you only when they're triple teamed, and rarely pass to open teammates, and even when you get it, it's so unexpected you miss an open 3.   All in all having players like this in NBA and NBA 2K21 should not be handling the ball as often as they should."
"this is not true. first of all derrick and dejounte can share the floor, they really complement each other in the best way possible, really, what one do not do, the other do it well. off the bench the bench we have lonnie walker who yes has defensive issues but he played alongside demar and often as a wing which he absolutely is not so he wasn't in a really good situation to defend, plus in general he's not that great. patty mills might leave and go to a contender while he fully go youth movement, win-win situation for both us and him. so we would have tre jones in development who showed really positive flashes, and we could sign a pg just in case too. we do not have five point guards, we are in a right situation in terms of guards, just no need to add more espeically considering how weak our frontcourt is.  i'll also add some other things from a post i did like more than a month ago about our situation, you can read it all if you want [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Let's begin by stating the versatily of the players. DJ is a pure PG, same goes with Tre. Derrick White is gonna start at SG, but he would have zero issues to play the PG  alongside Lonnie who on the other hand could slide at 1 for a small amount of time, but he is definitely a Pure 2 and not a 3 AT ALL, this season showed us this. Keldon is a full-time 3 but he can easily slide at 4 in a small-ball situation. About Devin I would say that he definitely need to play the 3 as his preferred position, he has all the tools to do so, and a solid summer in the gym would define it; he can slide at 2 regardless. DJ-DW Backcourt is really deadly. DJ proved this season that he is arguable the best player on the court without DeMar. And guess who is the other dude that is arguable the best player after DeMar? Derrick White. So yeah, a starting backcourt of this two is obvious and worked amazing when they were both fully healthy. I would play DJ and DW around 30+mins, maybe Derrick a couple of minutes more since he's more versatile. Off the bench Lonnie should definitely be our go-to-guy, our 6-Man. uly him more around 20-25m, limayeb slide him at 1 if necessary. Tre ones is also a really good fit with him, he needs a true PG like him that repares the play for him, they complement each other. The point is that Tre is not that ready, but he has to play, for sure, I would play him around 10-15m, but he can easily see his minutes go up if he keeps doing well! Devin at 3, maybe at 2 if needed, would be really good, a 3&amp;D guy like him is really amazing, I would play around just below 20mins. On defense our true liability is Lonnie, but he would find Tre and Devin, both elite defender, on the perimeter helping him so he can focus on his man and Lonnie showed he can be even above average if he focus on 1v1, imagine with an offseason of work.  also a ""small"" review on their season:  DEJOUNTE MURRAY  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  DERRICK WHITE  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  LONNIE WALKER IV  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him? I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  DEVIN VASSELL  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season"
Jrue Holiday might start to give Kemba Walker vibes if he stays so inconsistent. I hope they both get back to their best and healthiest though
"I mean, Jerami Grant's on there and I wouldn't max him. Jrue Holiday on a max feels pretty bad too."
Nope. We have jalen green and a bunch of promising players. You owe jrue holiday like 150 million LOL
thank god for a lot of people they traded for Jrue Holiday then
"Jrue ""On A"" Holiday"
"No, Bledsoe was just salary to make the Jrue Holiday trade work"
Jrue Holiday = JH = Jekyll and Hyde
"""Cancun Cancun Cancun""  -Jrue Cancun Holiday"
They should try to get Jrue Holiday.
jrue holiday bout to go on a true holiday
"we had to sit here all season hearing about how jrue ""underrated"" holiday was going to lead the bucks to the promised land, it's like the ben simmons slander except bucks fans aren't as annoying as sixers fans so it's not as bad"
"If the finals end without any help coming from Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday, I don't know how in the world Giannis will find the motivation to stay on the bucks"
"Look at how Holiday, Middleton, Lopez and even Portis played in those last two games against Atlanta. They shared the load that Giannis usually carries and it worked. Khris and Jrue had good games with Giannis on the court as well, but in G2 for instance, Atlanta just sucked and the Bucks won. Giannis is great, but sometimes his greatness wears on the team's level."
"I feel like his insistence on going coast to coast so much takes Jrue Holiday completely out of the game as the PG. Giannis is incredible going to the rim, don't get me wrong. But he's not a great FT shooter and sometime I wish he would give the ball to a true ball handler/distributor and just run out on the break to get a lob finish or allow their shooter to set up for 3's."
"Jrue Holiday is a good player but he's so wildly overrated.  He's always been an erratic shooter, and erratic shooters are going to be unreliable in the postseason.  Like you said, good defender and facilitator, but scoring has never really been his thing."
"Jrue was playing really good defense on Chris Paul, but he also was throwing some uncharacteristically bad passes that didn't seem to be due to the defense.  I wonder with Holiday if he's just too worn out from defending Booker and CP3 all game to be as big of an offensive threat as he could be."
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here's the latest one:  Jrue Holiday: [https://basketballbeacon.com/jrue-holiday-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/jrue-holiday-player-profile-stats/)  If you liked it, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page)  Thanks!"
"It happened in 2015. Warriors played Pelicans without Jrue Holiday, Grizzlies without Mike Conley, and then in the Finals the Cavs without Kyrie and Love. Don't think anyone cares today."
You don't need to play clamping defense to be a good defender. It's not like you're either Jrue Holiday or trash. He's a decent defender who puts himself in good position to contest shots. That's honestly all you can ask for
More like Fish Middleton and Jrue On-A-Holiday
"His tenure with the Hornets/Pelicans was:  Year 1: 46 wins, took the 2-time defending champion Lakers to 6 in the first round; after season CP3 is traded away after a vetoed trade would have brought Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragic; instead the Hornets get Eric Gordon (the most despised player in New Orleans history), Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and a pick.  Year 2: Hornets finish last in the West with a roster where Marco Bellinelli and Greivis Vasquez lead the team in minutes. Gordon only plays 9 games. Hornets win the 1st overall pick and pick Anthony Davis.  Year 3: AD has an okay but not great rookie season, averaging 13.5 pts in 64 games. Minutes leaders are Vasquez and Ryan Anderson. Gordon misses half the season. Hornets finish with 27 wins. Pels trade their draft pick which ends up being Nerlins Noel for Jrue Holiday.  Year 4: They are now the Pelicans. I buy season tickets for $200/seat (seriously!). Jrue is injured after 34 games and misses the remainder of the season. AD has a break out season averaging 21 and 10, but also misses 15 games with injuries. Gordon misses 18 games. Ryan Anderson only plays 22 games. Hornets finish with 34 wins. Pelicans acquire Tyreke Evans in the offseason via trade.  Year 5: AD continues to improve to 24/10. Holiday misses half the season with an injury but the Pels still win 45 and grab the 8th seed, but are swept by the Warriors during their first championship run with Curry. Monty Williams is fired, and the Pelicans have made the playoffs only once since then."
"How does this team get better tho? The Nets took them to 7 without Kyrie and a hurt Harden. I think it’s safe to assume the Nets are a better team than the Bucks. You probably give them 1 more year, and fire Bud. I would be listening to offers for everyone except Giannis, but who you getting for Middleton and Jrue Holiday that makes you better unless they just gather assets with trading those to for a Dame Lillard, Bradley Beal trade. I don’t think they could get enough assets maybe if they trade everyone, but then it’s Giannis and Dame/Beal with no depth at all. That’s only if they get swept tho you keep the team if they show good fight and go 6 or 7"
"The sense that players are on their own.  ""Why do you look me like that, go draw your own plays and do whatever, just don't bother me, mmmkay?""  Guy decided that it's better to be a non coach in the NBA finals of all places. I mean it requires balls to appear so very clueless before the cameras, I must give him that, but he basically allows for a boring finals because suddenly -under him- Jrue Holiday is Drew Bledsoe and Khris Middleton is Kate Middleton.  Funny thing is that the teams are almost evenly matched personel wise, all we see in the court is a team with a plan vs one with no plan (i.e. ""play random"")"
Jrue Holiday was underrated so long that people noticed and swung the other way and now he’s absolutely overrated
Jrue “Ben Simmons” Holiday. Good defense. Couldn’t buy a layup  for most of the game apparently.
Jrue Holiday with a 48% true shooting throughout the playoffs so far...yikes
"Yes, Kyle Lowry is miles better than Jrue Holiday"
Holiday and Jrue did too
"Nah just wait until the regular season and they have one good game. We gonna be hearing about team underrated as usual: Mike Conley, Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Jrue Holiday, Patrick Beverly   r/NBA loves hyping up guys that get exposed badly during the playoffs every year because of ""potential"" or ""underrated"" or whatever."
"i kept saying the bucks werent gonna win with this core, middleton wouldnt be a bad second option if he wasnt so streaky, jrue holiday i think is a similar deal and he's not as good as he once was, despite being only 31. i think some of this core is salvageable, but they need a new #2 guy and to remove some of the roleplayers (and the headcoach? seems like bud has made some adjustments these playoffs, but jf they are still losing idk)"
"Who wants Middleton for $35 million a year or Jrue Holiday for $31 million? I think at that point, trading those guys gives them diminishing returns.   Because they can’t trade for a top tier superstar that is required to push them over the hump. And there really isn’t a better player than guys like Middleton/Jrue that can be had realistically."
"Nah, too many people on this forum underestimate how good jrue holiday defense is and how much it brings to the bucks. I would try to resign him lol."
"Giannis was scaring the shit out of me in the first quarter, the dude was playing absolutely amazing, and of course even tho I’m a suns fan I gotta give jrue holiday some props for getting up there and blocking deandre ayton like that"
"Day 10 of saying ""jrue holiday is overrated"""
"Put Jrue on that Magic team and he’s 25pts a night easily.  Lol, Jameer Nelson vs Jrue Holiday."
"Magic in 5, if Middleton and Jrue Holiday are your 2nd and 3rd options then you're in for a world of pain"
"Jrue ""butterfingers"" holiday"
"He has Jrue fucking Holiday and Khris Middleton. That’s better than 80% of NBA teams 2nd and third options. Hell, Middleton dropped 40% on 3’s averaging 30 points the last three games prior to today.  People are acting like Giannis is playing with Sacramento out there. Is it better than Phoenix’s lineup? No, but it’s not some poverty level roster."
"But do they even have the cap space or the ability to go over the cap to re-sign Portis/Tucker.  Tucker is easily worth 10-14M a year and he knows this is his last chance to make a big bag.  Portis showed out in the playoffs and may take another small deal with the Bucks but if there are bigger playing opportunities and a bigger deal i think he takes that rather than play spot minutes in the playoffs.  Which means Portis is most likely gone and then they have to focus on retaining Tucker.  Lets say they run this team back minus Portis, they will be extremely lucky to get out of the East esp if they face a healthy Nets team who surely will improve their roster by either adding Dinwiddie or another player in a sign and trade.  This was the Buck's best and probably only chance to make and win the Finals and so far it looks like they are blowing it. All they had to do was steal one game in Phoenix and they couldnt even do that.  Their best chance was in game 1 - Booker and Crowder shot 1-13 from the 3pt and the Suns were horrendous behind the arc. And the Bucks still lost by 13 with Giannis giving you a somewhat huge game 20/18 after many thought the wouldnt play.  And who the hell wants Jrue holiday at 35M next season?  Their best bet is to trade Middleton for a sub par true PG to run the offense.  Name one team that would trade for Middleton, i cant think of any.  Jrue is even tougher to move - paid more, longer contract, and needs a true PG next to him. What team is going to spend 35m+ for a PG that cant run the point?"
Pelicans fans know this Jrue holiday well
After they swept us I remember they were saying Jrue Holiday is better than jimmy Butler
"And people a week or two ago were daring to compare Middleton to Paul George lol.  He's not on PG's level, a bad game for PG = 20-25 points, that's a good game for Middleton.  And Jrue Holiday has got to be the most overrated player this year."
Devin Booker has a higher chance of making a contested step back 360 three than jrue holiday has of making a layup
"Jrue ""Cancun can't come sooner"" Holiday"
"Bucks are fucked  Who is gonna take Middleton and Jrue now with their loaded ass deals?  Middleton is due 36M, 38M, and 40M in the next three seasons   Meanwhile, Jrue Holiday is due 31M, 33M, 36M, and 38M (in 2024-2025 oof!)  PJ Tucker is making 8M a year and he is unrestricted - will they be able to go over the cap to sign him?  Bobby Portis will opt out and try to get a new deal - doubt he returns.  So at best you run the same squad minus Bobby Portis at worst you run the same team without Tucker/Portis who both played huge minutes in these playoffs.  Middleton could probably be traded for two role players but you arent getting someone back with similar production so you have to stay with him  Same goes with Jrue who is going to pay him 33M next year when he only put up 18pts / 6 assists"
So maybe the bucks overpaid for Jrue Holiday
"khris middleton and jrue holiday were out today, if they play by next game the bucks have a chance still"
Jrue “1 2 3” Holiday
What’s really a shame is that Jrue Holiday played amazing defense most of the game.
Why were the hawks the only team that had to face jrue holiday man that isnt fair
"Jrue Holiday had a +1 until the final 2 minutes.  His shooting was ass, but he was balling out on defense.  If I'm a buck fan, I'm not happy with Holidays play overall tonight, but I can live with it.  Everyone else that isn't Giannis or Holiday has to be better if they even want to sniff a win."
&gt; Much better  &gt; As good?   &gt; HUGE GAP  It sounds like you just don't like Jrue Holiday
"The only thing that's really ugly about their offense is their shooting percentage.  They just can't make buckets.  It's not a scheme problem, they just can't make shots.  I mean Jrue Holiday missed 3 layups for Christ's sake."
"The counting stats are very important here as well.

Jrue holiday stopping buckets at both ends.
"Yea I realized, I thought Jrue holiday was on a better contract.  That dude should not be making 30 mil lol"
"Jrue ""Drew Bledsoe"" Holiday"
Jrue Holiday
Yeah I guess if Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday play aswell as KCP and Dennis they’ll lose lol
Holy shit I didn’t realize Jrue holiday was on a near max contract. Jesus Christ they are fucked
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are such humble players that if they ever had a great game they must shit the bed at the next one just to offset everything
Bucks have no moves to make. The team went all in on fucking Jrue Holiday. Should’ve gone after Chris Paul tbh
Jrue Holiday
I can kind of forgive Jrue Holiday. He's been giving all time effort guarding the Suns' backcourt all night. He's been picking up either CP3 or Booker when they're handling the ball.
"Without Jrue no way the Bucks beat the Nets.   I remember playoff Bledsoe, I'd take Jrue Holiday even when he's struggling over that."
"He's better and he also gets paid 10m more   120m in the next 5 years, paying 35 year old Jrue Holiday 37 million lmao"
Jrue Holiday or Eric Bledsoe who do you trust with a shot down the stretch to win the game down 1?
Jrue 'I'm on' Holiday
For the Suns-Jrue holiday vacation   Bucks-Lebron in 2007 in a Scooby doo mask
We all know you are in the finals because of injury. Reality is this your only shot with Giannis and Jrue Holiday is crapping the bed
Turns out trading for CP3 instead of Jrue Holiday would probably have been a better idea
Jrue Holiday with the ultimate homage to Eric Bledsoe
People are putting way too much blame on Jrue Holiday. He was playing fantastic defense on CP3 pressuring him from half court nearly every possession and forcing him into 6 turnovers  You cannot realistically expect a player to give you much on the offensive end when they’re using so much energy on defense
"Jrue ""On His"" Holiday already."
Jrue locked everyone up. Caught in the crossfire of that defense however was Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
Giannis Antetokounmpo Jrue Holiday Kris Middleton on paper this sound absolutely right but  when it’s game time that’s something else
"Jrue ""I Can't Wait To Go On Holiday"" and Miss Middleton (cause he ain't making nothin)"
Out-of-Khash Middleton and Jrue It’s-A-Holiday back at it again

Is jrue holiday trying to build a house with all those bricks? Wtf man
Jrue League Holiday and Khris Humphries too heavy
Pat Connaughton is getting abused on defense.  Khris Middleton is doing his fan favorite houdini act  Jrue Holiday has become Eric Bledsoe.  Brook Lopez has reverted back into Brook Lopez after looking like prime Kareem in against the Hawks.  It's a damn shame.
Jrue ‘I don’t want to be here’ Holiday
I would love it. Jrue Holiday just looks lost out there like the stage is too big for him
"See, if you look here, you can see that Jrue Holiday is not good at basketball."
"Lemme tell ya, watching your favorite player (Jrue Holiday for yours truly) completely and utterly sell in his NBA Finals debut feels like absolute shit"
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Suns game when gunshots rang out in my house. It turns out the sound was just Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down you two!
Jrue holiday is the greatest basketball player of all time
**Jrue Holiday FMVP**
Jrue Holiday mvp. straight up.
"What a fucking game, Suns going crazy first quarter not missing then Bucks took over 2nd and 3rd and then Suns coming back hot for the 4th  Booker went crazy, a back to back 40 pt game in the finals in his first playoff run but Jrue fucking Holiday this game holy shit. Middleton, Connaughton and of course Giannis showed up too but damn  I remember thinking that Jrue was gon have a good game when he made that first shot of the game but wow"
"Jrue ""not Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday mvp of the game"
What. A. Game. Jrue Holiday has been incredible

JRUE HOLIDAY HEARD YA'LL WERE TALKING SHIT.
Jrue Holiday.
"Jrue ""Call me Bledsoe one more fucking time"" Holiday"
So glad Jrue Holiday is getting recognized for the defensive beast he is
How does Monty Williams not put in rebounders for the Giannis and1 free throw? Devin Booker is the one who has to go in and body Jrue Holiday for the rebound? They had a timeout and he's more likely to miss that than make it.
Jrue fucking Holiday
Bucks are 7-1 in these playoffs when Jrue Holiday scores 20+ points

Don't waste this Jrue Holiday game on free throws man
bro what? jrue holiday has more points off of **just** fadeaways in this game than he had points in the entirety of game 4  how can you blame the defense for contested fadeaways over centers going in from 18 feet away?
Jrue holiday masterclass
"Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and Giannis activated their inner family."
Jrue Holiday trying to get into the HOF with this performance.
Does anyone know the name of the song that was playing during the Jrue Holiday highlights before they cut to commercial?
He was hot early then Jrue fucking Holiday happened.
Jrue holiday or Michael Jordan?
Shouldn’t you be happy as a Pelicans fan (Jrue Holiday)?
Fucking Jrue Holiday turns into a beast. Fuuuckkkkkkk
Think Chris Paul has nightmares of Jrue Holiday clamping?
Jrue Holiday becoming an NBA finals hero
You know it’s over when Jrue Holiday is shooting over 70% from the field and Giannis is making JUMPshots
Jrue Holiday defense 😍😍😍
Virgin Chris Paul vs. Chad Jrue Holiday
Someone should tell Pat Bev to watch Jrue Holiday. That’s how you play defense your body maintaining to be parallel and in front of the opposing player. Not diving to the opponent every single time.
Yea Bud isn't great in the playoffs and its pretty unlikely that Giannis will even make the finals as a Buck due to the rise of the 76ers and Nets but the FO has literally done everything they can including getting Jrue Holiday this summer and trying their hardest to get CP3
Jrue holiday
Hinkie traded a 22 year old Jrue Holiday who had just made the All Star team.
He traded a 22 year old Jrue Holiday who had just made the All Star team.
"This move tells me that Presti is not happy with how much they've been winning though .  He wants to win  less , especially with SGA out .   The reason they haven't bottomed out yet is because they had so much to start their rebuild with .  PG and Westbrook was way more ammo than the Sixers had.  I think their best asset when hinkie took over was Jrue Holiday.    Presti has mostly been taking good players who happen to be overpaid (CP3 , Horford) .  Not to mention SGA himself is good enough to prevent bottoming out .  Philly wasn't getting anyone as good as that when hinkie blew it up"
"Our entire line-up tonight takes up less cap space than Jrue Holiday.  You could have this entire line-up and a cool 4 million left over, OR one Al Horford."
"Jrue holiday as a backup? Are you kidding me, that would be so nasty. Best defensive team ever."
"&gt; The Bucks traded away  multiple first round picks in order to obtain Holiday. The Blazers just traded away a young talent (Trent Jr.) in a gamble that a player (Powell) who is slightly better right now will stay with them come the offseason. The Jazz gave up multiple firsts for Connelly.  And the Nuggets just traded an extremely talented prospect and a 1st for Gordon.   Are you really comparing Jrue, Powell, Gordon and Conley with the LMA and Blake? They aren't even decent role players now."
Jrue holiday
Idk all the players in the league that are from Cali but just going off your list I’ll go   Aaron Holiday   Kawhi   Harden   Lillard   PG  Westbrook   Klay   DeMar   Jrue
"Y’all notice how ever since we traded Jrue Holiday, Dame wants to take our game personally or something."
"Yeah and Jrue Holiday is from Chatsworth and went to HS in Studio City, I wouldn’t consider the Valley to be inner city LA either."
We should trade for Jrue Holiday he would be pretty good at defending
"What the bucks need is not jrue holiday, but for Middleton to finally take another step offensively. In the playoffs multiple teams have figured out how to wall Giannis off and bam had proven to be one of the best at it.  Can Middleton carry the load for seven games if that happens again."
crazy how all these hall of famers and jrue holiday played against eachother
Dude said Jrue holiday was better than Rudy Gobert lol
Siakam is already on Toronto. If you mean Pacers that's a pretty good trade. Helps every team with their needs. But I think you're talking about Aaron Holiday and not Jrue right?
California Mr. Basketball winners during this period:  2005 - Amir Johnson  2006 - Chase Budinger  2007 - Taylor King  2008 - Jrue Holiday  2009 - Kawhi Leonard
"I know they realistically still could beat us, but the way we've been playing all year has essentially been practice for playing against the defense that the Heat beat us with last year, and Giannis is getting very good at it. Plus, the Heat are certainly worse this year than last while the Bucks added Jrue Holiday instead of praying that Eric Bledsoe doesn't completely ruin the game for them. I would pick Bucks over Heat for sure right now"
"Yes.   I think because they lost Matthews, Holiday is a perfect fit because he can be the point guard AND the wing stopper they need.  But talent wise CP3 is still better than Jrue. And while I'm really high on Middleton, I believe CP3 running PNR with Giannis would be unstoppable : you can't switch a smaller guy on Giannis and while he can be limited in pure iso, CP3 just kills any tradionnal pnr defense"
Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday and the Pels swept him
Thats not fair  Wheres Jrue Holiday when you need him
People only look at the offense and the shooting.  He hasn’t become stagnant at all he’s improved every year at other facets.  His passing this year was borderline a breath of fresh air especially when Markelle went down because he was a better playmaker than all of our other guards.  He played backup point guard for large stretches and other than when he was guarded by Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday he took advantage of that big time.   And defensively he continue to play at a borderline all defensive level.  This idea that he’s stagnant comes from people who only read slash lines and never watch the game.  If you watch a single game of his watch when we play Dallas and see how Luka struggle to score when guarded by AG.  He never falls for the step back or the silly touch fouls and the only time Luka got off was when AG was switched off of him or whenever the coach called for traps for some reason and Luka made the smart pass.
"Butler, Embiid, CP3, Jokic, Jrue Holiday, Steven Adams"
Jrue Holiday
Jrue holiday contracted the virus of corona during our losing streak
"The debate would be if another team was offering something better. Lowry’s value is highest to contenders which don’t have much to offer and the Raptors FO wouldn’t send Lowry to a sub .500 team unless it was for a haul. Lowry is  the GOAT Raptor, the franchise will do right by him. The Raptors don’t want to go into tanking because it would fit the timeline of OG, Siakam, and VanVleet.   In terms of leverage, the Raptors have a lot vs what the Sixers can offer. It becomes do the Sixers want a real chance at winning a chip? What are you willing to give up for it? It would be silly for Masai to not try and grab a Jrue Holiday-type haul."
"Yeah, they made no changes. Bucks got a All-Star playmaker in Jrue Holiday. Sixers got Simmons back, got rid of Horford, and will improve near the deadline. Nets have 2 top 5 and 1 top 12 players as well. They are favored maybe over the Celtics, but that is it."
Jrue Holiday...till my last breath
thats a dogshit offer tbh  an expiring Jrue Holiday got traded for 2025 and 2027 1sts and pick swaps in 2024 and 2026  Vuc is on a cost controlled contract and arguably just as valuable
And not paying a kings ransom for Jrue holiday
"&gt;NOLA's offense performed fine against the best defense in the league in the 2015 first round  eh, They got swept. How much do we want to read into a series where Golden State never felt remotely threatened?  &gt;Lakers were fine in the playoffs last year when LeBron sat as long as AD was on the court.  I think it's important to realize how unsustainably, ahistorically hot AD was last year in the playoffs. He was shooting like prime Dirk all over the court. I believe that was the bubble. He wasnt that good in the 2020 regular season, was never that good in NOLA, and has reverted back to his normal, mediocre shooting %s this season. AD is a career .317% 3pt shooter. I could be convinced he's arount a 33% shooter at this point in his career. In the 2020 playoffs he was shooting 38% from 3 and 55% on long 2s. For one playoff run he was AD combined with Dirk's shooting, and yeah, that guy is fucking unstoppable. But I dont think that's a repeatable thing.   &gt;AD could really be the central focus of an elite offense even without a great PG.   Young Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans were both solid players, and Davis only managed two playoff appearances and once series victory before he joined Lebron. Part of that is health, but staying healthy is a skill too. Jokic actually *already* has more career playoff VoRP than Davis, despite Davis having the finals run with Lebron.  I don't mean to put down AD, who is going to be a first ballot HoFer. But Jokic has already more-or-less matched his success as a first option. I'm pretty certain you can flip Jokic and AD and LA still wins last years title.   Regardless, I don't think AD needing another guy to be the best offensive player is this huge demerit--I mean, the KG paralell is right there, and I have KG top 15 all-time"
Add Jrue Holiday and Jerami Grant to the Nets lineup and it’s a fucking wrap.
"You're right, they're not equal. Chris Paul was an MVP candidate who is currently leading another team to 2nd seed in the West. Jrue Holiday was an all-star in a historically weak Eastern Conference, and hasn't made a single all-star appearance in the 8 years since that trade.   imagine thinking you actually know basketball lmaooo"
Trading 35 year old CP3 in the downswing of his career =/= Trading 22 year old Jrue Holiday coming off his first ASG on the upswing of his career.
"Jrue Holiday from Philly to New Orleans has a crazy web too. That was in 2013.  Philly got Nerlens Noel and and a future 1st from New Orleans.   The future 1st was used on Elfrid Payton who was instantly traded to Orlando for Dario Saric, a future 1st, and a future 2nd (lol).   THAT future 1st was used on Shamet, who was traded for Harris.  Dario was traded for Butler, who was traded for Richardson, who was traded for Curry.   The future 2nd in that deal was traded to the Knicks for two future 2nds. One of those 2nds was traded to Dallas in the Curry deal, we still have the other one.   And of course Jrue was traded to Milwaukee for the boatload of picks, so the web will continue on for years."
I want to say Jrue Holiday
"Based on what? Lol the bucks have a better record this year, won the east  the last two years, added jrue holiday and resigned giannis to a multi year extension. The Celtics have kemba and his broken down body under contract for two more years after this season. I'd say the Celtics picks as of this moment are way more valuable than the bucks picks"
"Jeremi grant is in the first year of 3yr 60m contract, 26yrs old. Jrue Holiday is in the last yr of a 5 yr 126m contract age 31. He will be looking for more than that with his next contract. Jrue holiday has been a better in the past, but given the contract situation and the age I would much rather have Jerami Grant."
Two first round picks is not a Jrue Holiday like package.
"No way. Jrue has a proven track record of 300+ games as a first or second option. Since the 2014-15 season he’s put up 18/5/7 with 1.5 steals on average efficiency and great defense.   Plus we saw him in the playoffs where he and AD dismantled that Blazers team in a sweep. Jrue Holiday is one of the few guards who has outplayed Dame in a playoff series.  Meanwhile while Grant has been a revelation this season, it hasn’t even been 40 games."
Jrue is on the Bucks. We have his brother Justin Holiday.
Sleeping on Jrue Holiday ridiculously
"The article highlights what any smart basketball fan who has watched the Bucks for years can see:   - Giannis is much more devastating as a play finisher than as a play creator, especially in crunch time situations at the end of games.   - Giannis on a championship team is a lot more like Anthony Davis than he is LeBron.   - When Giannis is the play creator on the team, he's a 7-foot Westbrook, which is an incredible player, but one that's got glaring flaws that will be exacerbated in a playoff setting.   - Bucks are better off letting Middleton and Jrue make decisions with the ball in their hands in late game situations than Giannis, Middleton is the best bucket gettor on the team, and Jrue is the best decision maker on the team. Middleton is the 2nd best decision maker on the team.   - The existential question for the Bucks now is are Middleton and Jrue good enough to be your primary creators on offense on a championship caliber team? Will Jrue Holiday be more aggressive on offense when it counts like you could argue he needs to be on this team? 2 player comps I would make, is Jrue Holiday is smaller Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton is smaller Kevin Durant."
"They are a team that is probably going to lose in the 2nd round or even the 1st round as presently constituted, but has 80% of a championship puzzle piece completed, and if they traded for Kyle Lowry, I could see them winning it all.   They need that Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday ish type point guard to win a chip, that's the last piece IMO."
Everyone loves Jrue Holiday.
The whole Jrue Holiday fella will probably help in the playoffs too haha.  Dude's built for the postseason
Jrue holiday hasn’t looked the same since covid
"Apparently Danny Ainge doesn't want to win another title so you didn't have to sweat, he will sit on assets for the rest of his life while the Celtics get bounced in the second round again.  If anyone thinks that this Celtics squad as its is constructed right now can win a title, they are insane. Boston is Portland in the East, with the difference that the Celtics had opportunities to turn their assets in players like Anthony Davis or Jrue Holiday."
"I wanted Jrue Holiday or Malcolm Brogdon that offseason.  I think Kemba has value and is a great leader, but what we’d get back in a trade wouldn’t be a good enough return imo"
PG: Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry   SG: FVV/Duncan Robinson/Derrick White   SF: Joe Harris/Kyle Kuzma   PF:  Kevin Love/Blake Griffin   C: DeAndre Jordan/Andre Drummond/JaVale McGree  Is this the worst possible team you could assemble out of that finalists?     Edit. I am not sure about Point Guards
"Holiday is twice the player that Bledsoe is.  Bledsoe was the reason the Bucks lost to the Heat, and Jrue is a much better replacement."
"Good analysis - you’re def right. Overall, with everything combined, unless he were a top let’s say 10 or 15 player in the league, I think the expectations were unrealistic. You make really good points and I agree with what you said ! Improving his handle will open up so much more for his game I feel, and really unlock that Jrue Holiday type potential. It would lead to his scoring being so much easier and open up things then for his whole team just a bit."
"The Bucks got Jrue Holiday and my man Sam Merrill for what will be 3 picks in the late 20's, so i'm not sure who Danny thinks he pulled one over on here. Now he is stuck with nothing or overpaying for Jermai Grant."
"3 FRPs landed Jrue Holiday.  And that was an overpay.  If Denver is too dumb to cash out on a guy who is going to be too expensive for them to keep, then some other star will be gotten with those picks."
We should have traded all our first round picks till the end of time for Jrue Holiday?
"Beal isn’t going to get the same amount of shots that he gets in Washington so his averages won’t be nearly as high. Also, why would they give up Middleton who is way more efficient and Jrue Holiday who can guard 1 through 4 on top of giving you 15-20 a night. You’d have to hide Beal on defense which is a problem the Bucks don’t need right now considering their opponents 3pt% against them is high."
Nah I had already checked it out. Either Middleton or Jrue Holiday both have salary numbers comparable to Beal.
"In this age, when an organisation want's to blow a team up they'll do it. Look at OKC or Houston. If the bucks put in some young players maybe a vet like jrue holiday and a some picks it will probably be a solid deal for Washington"
You’d rather have Middleton and Jrue Holiday than Simmons and Harris  It’s not really shade  Two all stars who are two way players vs One all star who is a good defender/playmaker but a bad shooter and an efficient offensive player with average defense.
Selling the farm? Thisse Maxey and a pick isn’t the farm. The other two are salary filler (Scott and Green) Jrue Holiday brought in the farm and he’s not as good as Lowry. The next 2-3 years are the Sixers window and arguably this year because the Nets can’t stop Joel but he needs help.
Seems like he learned from Jrue holiday
"I have dudes I'd root for whether they leave/get traded or not. Jrue Holiday is definitely one of those guys.  Josh Hart/J.J. Redick -- more involved/vocal with the city/Pels fans than any player has been since CP left in 2011. Like Jrue, I'll be rooting for J.J. to get a ring when he heads out later this year. Lifelong fan of Josh now too.  BI -- as soon as he signed his max, he started coming out of his shell a little and showing his personality. I don't think he's ""quiet"" like people love to say. He has a *big* personality. lmao. Absolute *dawg* and I love it.  Zion -- always came off as super nice. There's not 'a single moment' that sold me on him, I've been sold on him from the jump--but when we were getting blown out in games early this year, I just noticed he doesn't 'give up.' Like Zion doesn't treat garbage time like it's garbage time. He plays very, very hard at all times and tries to will the game to a win if we're losing. I was really impressed seeing that from a guy that young.  It's been nice seeing him come out of his shell too because he and BI are both very smart and very interesting people to learn about. It's been fun getting to see them grow while they're here."
"&gt;Those 2-3 lost wins you're lamenting came as a result of Jrue Holiday missing time due to the coronavirus  ... and having to play D.J. Augustin as their only PG because of it, instead of George Hill lol"
Those 2-3 lost wins you're lamenting came as a result of Jrue Holiday missing time due to the coronavirus. The Bucks would be the #1 seed right now if he didn't miss 10 games.   George Hill ain't that important. lol
"&gt; Everyone respects Jrue Holiday, it's amazing!    &gt;   &gt; Fr one of the most underrated guys in the league   &amp;#x200B;  I feel like only one of these can be true lol"
"All indications are that Orlando won't part with Vooch for anything other than a massive haul. I'd say they're looking at the Jrue Holiday deal and saying ""Vooch is better than Holday"" and wanting more than what the Bucks gave up for Jrue.  3 FRP + 1-2 decent prospects has to be the starting point I'd think."
Jrue Holiday has covid. Confirmed it in the bucks-clippers post game interview
I saw him bully jrue holiday few times. It was brutal
"“You put Jrue in any system, any coach is going to ask him to guard the best player. We played them in 2018, second round and he guarded me the whole series. He was picking me up full court, he was guarding me in the post. Actually, it was tough to dribble on Jrue Holiday. He slides his feet so well, he’s got good hands, he’s strong, he’s got good instincts. I gained a lot of respect for him in that series because he went from guarding me to Klay (Thompson) to Steph (Curry) to guarding Draymond (Green), neutralizing picks and rolls. He’s special. He’s special on that side of the ball. Jrue Holiday is solidified as probably the best defender in the league at the guard position. “ - Kevin Durant"
"Everyone respects Jrue Holiday, it's amazing! Fr one of the most underrated guys in the league"
Tony Allen Andre Roberson Jrue Holiday Bruce Bowen are just guys who come to mind
"ben wallace, tony allen, jrue holiday, kawhi leonard"
Seems like people cooled down on him this season but jrue holiday.
"The Sixers didn't draft Noel, they traded for him(and an addtional 1st round pick) in the Jrue Holiday trade a couple of weeks after the draft.  The Sixers took MCW with their own pick."
Jrue Holiday +19000 👀👀👀
Steph Curry  Jrue Holiday (Post haircut)  Kelly oubre   Gordon Hayward   Nic Claxton
Hinkie traded away a 23 year old Jrue Holiday for Nerlens lol
"Edit: Pre-face - you aren’t wrong. This has been said so many times about this Bucks team. But….  This is coming from a life-long Heat fan.   This year feels a little different. The players definitely seem more locked in and in tune with each other. That team has just been firing right this season. When I watch them this year they just flow more than they have.  Giannis is Giannis. He’s going to do his thing.  Middleton just seems to do something to the Heat I can’t describe and my hate for him is strong. (He fucked me so hard so often in 2k14 bricking left and right and I just haven’t gotten over it)  Add in what appears to be a hyper focused Lopez, Jrue Holiday (seriously who can dislike this man?!), and I’m just not feeling as confident as I did last year. If Middleton and Giannis are clicking, this team will be in the finals. Not sure they will win it all, but they definitely have the talent and chemistry this year. Ultimately if they fuck it up, Bud is gone and rightfully so."
"Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, Solomon Hill, Julius Randle, Anthony Morrow, Daunte Cunningham"
Kwame Brown and Jrue Holiday link Michael Jordan and Zion Williamson
"The 2018 first round sweep against the lower-seeded Pelicans is another one.  Game 1: 18 points on 6-for-23 from the field   Game 2: 17 points on 7-for-18 from the field plus 7 turnovers   Game 3: 20 points on 5-for-14 from the field plus 8 turnovers   Game 4: 19 points on 7-for-16 from the field  His counterpart on the Pelicans - Jrue Holiday - not only contributed to Dame's poor offensive performance, but had two huge offensive games himself: 33 points on 14-for-24 from the field in Game 2 and 41 points on 15-for-23 from the field in the closeout Game 4."
"Think of the team we could have had. nikola vucevic , Jrue Holiday, maybe iggy for a couple years longer. and mid tier picks"
"Jrue Holiday carried this bum, Ian Clark, Solo Hill, E'twaun Moore, and Cheick Diallo to the second round single handedly. 2015 was a bum team with bum players doesn't count"
Didn’t you trade an young all star in Jrue Holiday for Nerlens Noel? No reason to trade him
"As Jrue Holiday said, ""Great defenders get away with a lot."""
"No arguments there.  I can see the bucks winning this year cause motivation from all their early disappointing playoff exits, the addition of Jrue holiday  and experimenting different defensive schemes has been a major change.  Knicks V Hawks is literally a toss up. No one expected either of them too make the playoffs let alone be the 4th &amp; 5th seeds. I really like this first round match up. (Yes, ATL was building their team to make the playoffs but I didn't expect them to be anything more than a bottom 2 seed)"
Why can’t the entire scheme and team get credit? Why does he have to make first team all defense? He is an awesome defender but he doesent deserve all defense over guys like Simmons and Jrue Holiday.  You don’t need to give an individual all the credit when it’s the team that’s made that defense #1.
"Couldve been in on Jrue Holiday. Great fit imo.  Kyle Lowry was available.  Warriors probably could've topped what Houston got for Harden, lol"
"Lmao, the homer glasses. Dame would have looked like he did vs Jrue Holiday and the hornets if he went up against that type of D."
"I agree, and lmao reminds me of that dude who keeps rageposting that Jrue Holiday clip of everyone praising him as if that makes him the best player in the world or something"
"That's true. He's also had the good fortune of being a big part of a dynasty, while AD's best teammates were Jrue Holiday and a year or so of Boogie.    Btw, Pels franchise index on BBref is kinda disappointing. Zion is legit top 10 in WS"
"Assuming they stay healthy? They'd be a fringe contender. Love and Curry pick and pop would be pretty lethal. TBH I'm not in love with DeRozan's fit, but I'm also a pretty big DeRozan skeptic.   If they drafted Jrue Holiday and Steph to pair with Kevin Love, they'd be very solid.   Starting lineup of:   C: Nikola Pekovic or Al Jefferson  PF: Kevin Love  SF: Corey Brewer or Wesley Johnson  SG: Jrue Holiday  PG: Steph Curry   would be pretty nasty offensively. I could see them being a perennial 50 win team."
"&gt;He’s guarded AD before you know. In playoff series  When AD's next best guy was Holiday. Sure, Jrue is good but he doesn't command attention like AD's current running mate."
"Agreed, he can better than most. Though I'd say those numbers are a bit skewed...the first was during 4 game losing streak where Dame was off, the 2nd was his first game back after sitting 3 games, recovering from an injury he had been playing through for weeks. In my book, Jrue Holiday is still the closest thing to a Dame stopper in thr league.  It will be an interesting series, but we can't really look to the regular season to predict it. CJ &amp; Nurk missed the first matchup (not to mention differences in your personnel), the second was decided by 1 point, and you guys phoned in thr 3rd while we went all out."
"True the top guys have not played as well as they can and it is on them to perform. Green and curry are much more limited than what I was thinking, nobody is scared of a Seth curry pick and roll. I just think this team would be insanely hard to stop if you replaced Tobias Harris’s salary slotwith a guy like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, maybe even Kemba walker or Jrue holiday etc..   obviously that’s true cause most of those guys are all better than Harris but also cause every other high level playoff offense we’ve seen has somebody who is a legitimately good perimeter creator and the sixers have the least perimeter creation of any contender and I think that imbalance is largely cause they gave all that money to Harris. It’s also bad because every team has to play big against embiid and the sixers do a terrible job of taking advantage of slow bigs by forcing them to play in space because their guards are so limited"
"Bledsoe was making Bud's system seem playable. Bud teams refuse to guard the perimeter. Bledsoe though was (and is) a speed demon and could make their defense seem playable. In fact they were 1st in the league because they were taking away the inside shot (as they do now) and Bledsoe was enough of a nuisance for the Bucks to guard the 3 semi well.  Yes, Jrue Holiday is a way better player as a whole and a better defender more specifically. However their defense fell of a cliff for a reason. Jrue is simply not as fast and while he defends better on occasion, most often than not he is less capable to guard the perimeter in Bud's system.  The Bucks became better in personel but worse as a team. You !at ask how so? The answer is above basically, Bud.refuses.to.guard the perimeter in a non gimmicky way. So he needed a gimmicky player to make his defense look semi good in the regular season.  Then the playoffs came along and gimmicky defense did not work anymore. Add Bledsoe's inability to score in a half court setting and suddenly you get the results they did.  This time around they are worse than *that*. Yeah they can score better, however runs would be more frequent from their opponents. Because runs always start from a few 3s in a row and the Bucks are inviting their opponents to shoot them.  Again, they were last in the league in pull up guarding. Infact they are a very talented team (and for years I am telling that the personel is not the one holing them back) and they were 3rd on the east on talent alone. Still every.single.time the opposing team would get hot they would lose. Doesn't matter of the opposing team was bottom tier lottery hunters.... They would lose.  Those Bucks can lose from anyone and can certainly lose from those Heat in 7 games. They.do.not.guatd the 3. They often play zone, they go under the screen, they play drop defense (incapacitating one of their player to play effective defense).  After Bud is fired at the end of this season I doubt he gets another job on the NBA. His brand of basketball is anachronistic, painful to watch."
"How does someone put Wiggins over Draymond? You can just turn on a Warriors game and see how much more Draymond does.  Lamelo, Edwards, and Garland have no business being higher than FVV. FVV is pretty much a better scorer, passer, rebounder, and defender than Garland.  Sexton is also like not that good. You really think any team looking to win takes him over Jrue Holiday?"
"76ers had nothing to do with the play-in tournament. Sixers had been tanking and collecting assets so they can hopefully land a once in a generation player (Embiid). Sixers were selling high on Jrue Holiday and MCW. They tanked for 3 seasons aren't that bad, I'd rather tank for 3 seasons than being 8-10 seed mediocrity for many years every time"
"Yeah, the MCW trade, as well as the Thad Young and Jrue Holiday trades, are definitely good examples. Also, there was a rumor at one point that Hinkie had a trade of Jahlil for a first lined up that was vetoed by Jerry Colangelo, maybe that’s what you were thinking of?"
"Full list of everyone who qualifies for these filters (i.e. everyone who has made more than 50 pull-up threes since the ASB):  Steph Curry - 93/229 (40.6%)  Damian Lillard - 95/245 (38.8%)  Anthony Edwards - 55/142 (38.7%)  Buddy Hield - 53/139 (38.1%)  Jayson Tatum - 65/178 (36.5%)  Luka Doncic - 90/262 (34.4%)  CJ McCollum - 59/175 (33.7%)  Lowering the threshold to 40 adds Jrue Holiday (43/103, 41.7%), Joe Ingles (47/119, 39.5%), Donovan Mitchell (50/129, 38.8%), Zach LaVine (48/137, 35.0%), Kemba Walker (42/126, 33.3%), and Jordan Clarkson (49/175, 28.0%)."
Jrue Holiday.
"He's right. In between Jrue Holiday, Giannis, and Khris Middleton, I can confidently admit.....  HEAT IN 6 MFS 🔥🔥🔥😂"
"""I am very good""  \- Jrue Holiday, correctly"
"Well I think Giannis gives the Bucks that extra nudge because he is honestly in a leauge of his own. Also believe dipo would have been our Jrue holiday in this series but injuries fucking suck. But all in all, I think its comparable once you look at everyone else besides the freak."
"Its half a season though, compared to a full, what, 3 years? Philly had young talent (i.e. Jrue Holiday) and they traded it away for more young talent. OKC traded their 28+ all stars after they requested trades and were always heading down the standings. OKC have also been completely transparent with the league + that's why its been fine. Theyre also one of the smallest markets in the league, with a still injured future all star in Shai. Oh and Horford literally agreed with them that he should sit. He still travelled and trained with the team. Its not like he's been sat on his sofa all year"
Jrue Holiday money with less defense? Nah
"It's because Charania is an NBA reporter. If a women's soccer reported did the tweet, it would be ""Lauren Holiday and her husband Jrue""."
What a ridiculous thing to claim. They did...twice. Jrue Holiday and Demarcus Cousins.
"The matchup isn’t that great this year. Last year they had Crowder, who did a fantastic job staying in front of Giannis to make the wall work, and we had Bledsoe who did a fantastic job of playing for the Heat.  Matthews did alright guarding Butler last year but Jrue is a significantly better option, meanwhile DiVincenzo isn’t a Holiday/regular season Bledsoe-level defender but he’s a damn site better than playoff Bledsoe to stick on Dragic. They also struggled to guard Giannis off-ball, Bam does it pretty well but they were by no means clamping him up like they did on-ball on the rare occasions we actually let him play off-ball.  They’re still a tougher matchup than the Hawks and Knicks but it’s not nearly as lopsided as it was."
"Not really. Good players are just concentrated on contenders because of salary limitations individually. You could have 30 stars lead every team if spread out nicely.  1. Jokic 2. Giannis 3. Curry 4. Luka 5. Lebron 6. Dame 7. Butler 8. Kawhi 9. Randle 10. Zion 11. Embiid 12. CP3 13. Harden 14. Kyrie 15. KD 16. Westbrook 17. Tatum 18. Young 19. AD 20. Beal 21. KAT 22. PG 23. Mitchell 24. Simmons 25. Ingram 26. BAM 27. SGA 28. Morant 29. Siakam 30. Booker  You still have guys like McCollum, Klay, Gobert, Sabonis, Lavine, Derozan, Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown, Vucevic, Middleton, Draymond, Murray, Gordon, Kemba Walker, D'lo, Hayward to pair up with any guys above to balanced out really strong individuals like Lebron/Giannis/Curry/KD"
Jrue Holiday stan for life  Dude is like that guy in your gym class who was just better than everyone else at sports but didn't care who was on his team and had a positive attitude all the time
New holiday should be named Jrue on this day
Jrue Holiday
[Jrue Holiday](http://imgur.com/gallery/GpMSx)
Twitter is a shitty source for news. They are opening for a second round of applications.  Jrue pledged $5.3 million of his salary and this is the second round of money going out.   https://www.nba.com/bucks/news/jrue-and-lauren-holiday-social-impact-fund-opens-second-round-funding-black-owned-businesses
" This dude has to be the most charitable and kind hearted athlete there is.   I swear he makes more headlines for his contributions than he does for his game. And he's a freaking all-star! So he's not lacking in headlines for that.   He does so much for the communities he's a part of, its impossible not to like this guy.    NBA should re-name the Humanitarian of the Year Award to the Jrue Holiday Award, for real."
"Every thread comes back to LeBron in some shape or form. Post about a virtuous, good thing Jrue Holiday did? Better shit on LeBron."
NBA Bad Boy Jrue Holiday at it again
"I think Jrue is proof that Jonathan Isaac’s excuse of not getting involved with social justice because of religion doesn’t hold weight. Holiday, as well as Harrison Barnes, are the two most Christian NBA players and their faith is why they actively want to make the world a better place."
Honestly the addition of jrue holiday scares me. But I still think heat will win in 6 or less.
"Me too, but I doubt jrue holiday has ever had someone give him the talk lololol"
The Bucks should pay her too.  Coach and motivator for Jrue Holiday.
"&gt;As he made his usual postgame scan of his phone for messages, he was    greeted by a text from his wife, Lauren. It included the words that will    get any spouse’s attention: “We need to talk.”   &gt;   &gt;“You could have done more,” Lauren Holiday wrote.   &gt;   &gt;After his productive first quarter, Jrue Holiday scored only 1 point in    nearly six minutes in the second quarter. Lauren Holiday, who won two    Olympic gold medals and the 2015 World Cup as a bustling midfielder with    the United States women’s national soccer team, did not regard the    sweep of the Nets or her husband’s play as a significant statement. She    said she “felt like he took the quarter off.”  lol harsh. I love it though."
"Let me tell you something about Jrue Holiday, he only cares about basketball and his community and his family and his friends. But if you like him, whatever"
Has anyone ever said anything bad about jrue holiday? Serious question
"**ALL-NBA**  *FIRST TEAM*  G: Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard  F: Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Nikola Jokic  *SECOND TEAM*  G: Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler  F: LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard  C: Joel Embiid  *THIRD TEAM*  G: Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal  F: Julius Randle, Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert  ----  **ALL-DEFENSE**  *FIRST TEAM*  G: Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler  F: Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Rudy Gobert  *SECOND TEAM*  G: Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday  F: Matisse Thybulle, Bam Adebayo  C: Joel Embiid  ----  **ALL-ROOKIE**  *FIRST TEAM*  LaMelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Desmond Bane, Immanuel Quickley  *SECOND TEAM*  Jae'Sean Tate, Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Payton Pritchard, Facundo Campazzo"
Khris Middleton &amp; Jrue Holiday.
"I think Miami is going to find out the hard way that Jrue Holiday isn’t Eric Bledsoe lol.  It’ll be a tough, fun series."
I can’t stress enough how big of an upgrade Jrue Holiday is from Eric Bledsoe.
Jrue Holiday is a massive upgrade over bum ass Bledsoe  So I’m curious to see how it will all play out
And even gave up Jrue Holiday and then a first rounder to get 2 of them wrong (Noel and Fultz respectively)
It’s pretty much the same teams as last year besides the heat had a bad start because of a short off season and the Bucks got Jrue Holiday  With how much the Bucks got pounded by the heat last season idk if Jrue can help them with that
"Hawks and Bae Young. Ja Memphis. PHX. Miami. Actual DPOY Jrue Holiday and the Bucks. Pretty much anyone not NY or LA. Either way, this season has 100% lived up to the hype for me. Most competitive season I can remember and it’s been a blast all year."

&gt; I would also put Trae Young and Jrue Holiday up there.  Trae Young is most definitely better then Vanvleet Lol
"He’s not better than Kyrie, Harden, Beal, Jaylen Brown, LaVine, or Simmons in the East.  I would also put Trae Young and Jrue Holiday up there. He’s a very solid player though, guard position is just incredibly stacked."
Now that they replaced Eric the choker Bledsoe with Jrue Holiday they got nothing to feat
"I know it has been said many, many times, but I once again feel the need to emphasize just how much better than Bledsoe Jrue Holiday is."
"I kinda feel like Milwaukee has just been a Jrue Holiday away this whole time. Idk who's take it all this year, but it really wouldn't shock me to see Milwaukee do it"
&gt; They wouldn’t had traded the next 5 drafts picks for Jrue fucking Holiday if ~~our two best players didn’t shrink every playoff series~~ they weren’t a desperate poverty franchise that kept overpaying role players and drafting busts since they drafted Giannis   ftfy
"They wouldn’t had traded the next 5 drafts picks for Jrue fucking Holiday if our two best players didn’t shrink every playoff series. That’s why the bucks have no future. Coaching is not the biggest problem holding the bucks back from contending, idk how you’re arguing this with me lol I can count on one hand how many bucks games I have missed since Giannis and Khris have gotten here. The bucks went from 7th to 1st in one year and won their first series in almost twenty years just by replacing the coach. You need your star, max players to produce like star max players to win anything. Khris and Giannis have not and that’s why they’ve lost. It’s simple as that."
"I know this is old but the pelicans did get talent around ad but just had bad luck with injuries it wasn't Timberwolves KG  Dude had rondo, boogie, jrue holiday, eric gordon, julius randle (who had a good season there), nikola mirotic. It didn't work out for the most part because of injuries I'm tired of people saying the pelicans never tried to surround talent around him cause that's false"
"i love your ""jrue holiday"" flair"
"That Sterling Brown incident is one of the most baffling things ever. Like when I think about the Black Lives Matter or Defund the Police movement, I think about Sterling Brown (tased by police for parking in handicap), Thabo Sefolosha (cops broke his leg outside of a nightclub, he sued and won), Jrue Holiday (handcuffed at a routine traffic stop for not having his license with him). And that's just the NBA, some of the richest and most powerful people in America. Shit's wild."
I don't think anyone can root against Jrue Holiday
"Losing Bledsoe was already addition by substraction, plus they got Jrue holiday. On their bench they have shooters who take turns getting hot every other night. They have a chance getting the chip. The real test will be against the nets."
Jrue Holiday is +88 in this series’ 3 games jesus
Jrue Holiday is a fire fighter
"Jrue ""can make a layup unlike bledsoe"" Holiday."
"Getting jrue holiday was like going from playing 4v6 to playing on 6v4. That’s not really saying how good jrue is, but really about how bad Eric Bledsoe was"
Jrue Holiday is actually unreal.
"Jrue ""+41"" Holiday"
"Jrue ""+38"" Holiday"
"All of their players from last year are playing worse, particularly Herro and Bam. The Heat traded Olynk and Avery Bradley for basically nothing (Oladipo). Ariza looked good towards the end of the season, but to me he's been washed for a couple years now. The fact that the Heat expected him and Iggy to play legimate minutes was misguided.   Then, the Bucks got way better. Eric Bledsoe is addition by subtraction. Having a guy like Jrue Holiday who's legitimately a top 10 point guard helps a lot. You can count on Forbes, Tucker, and Portis. Divencenzo and Connaughton are better. They don't even need to rely on Giannis to put up big numbers offensively. Finally, this Bucks defense is just crazy.    Still, talent-wise, this Heat team shouldn't be getting beat like this. Jimmy Butler and Bam are all-stars/All-NBA players. They can't get one game? If you watch them, they're playing with no grit or energy. No one on the court seems to give a fuck. Jimmy isn't yelling. Herro looks like he's straight out of college or something. There's something more to this somewhere. I bet we'll find out after they get swept."
imagine swapping Eric Bledsoe for Jrue Holiday
PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday are the best glue guys in the league. Perfect additions to this Bucks team. It alleviates so much pressure off of Giannis and Khris in the early rounds.
"Shout-out bucks GM Jon horst, dude flipped Eric bledsoe and George hill for mother fucking jrue holiday"
Bucks lost an Eric Bledsoe and gained a Jrue Holiday.   Heat lost Jae Crowder and traded Kelly Olynyk for a Victor Oladipo with paper legs.
"jesus Jrue so fucking good, like hell if u argue Mike Conley underrated or should be all-star. Jrue Holiday is so far better."
jrue holiday is so good
People underestimated the Jrue Holiday trade like crazy the dude is phenomenal
Jrue is way better than holiday
It's truly amazing just how huge a difference there is between Eric Bledsoe and Jrue Holiday.  Bledsoe beating Jrue to an all-NBA defensive team last year will be one of those things in like 10 years people will use as the gold standard to trash how biased the media is against non-playoff teams.
The difference when you get rid of Bledsoe and get Jrue Holiday.   Giannis guarding the hottest players.   Giannis playing 40+ MINUTES!!!
Jrue Holiday is actively robbing Bucks fans of additional home playoff games against the Heat
Imagine having Robinson defend Jrue Holiday lol
jrue holiday is so damn strong.
 Remember when the Bucks overpaid for Jrue holiday
"Jrue Holiday is such an upgrade it's actually insane. When this trade first happened I legit thought he was *slightly* better than Bledsoe offensively and equal defensively. LOL at that assessment.... And bogdan would have been nice but I'm not sure we would have been able to get Bryn and Bobby in that scenario, who have just been huge for the Bucks.   This team is completely a different team than it has been over the last couple playoff runs"
Remember when we overpaid for Jrue Holiday
Perhaps it's time for me to eat my words calling Jrue Holiday the actual most overrated player in the NBA before the season!
That Jrue Holiday trade was MASSIVE for this team man. Absolutely massive
JRUE MOTHERFUCKER HOLIDAY
Milwaukee really gave away the bare minimum for JRUE HOLIDAY
Jrue Holiday is soooo much better than Bledsoe. My goodness
man i love jrue holiday
"legit, if jimmy wants to force a switch two of the other options are gonna be jrue holiday and pj tucker lol  man is in jail"
"Bucks really gameplanned and adjusted for the heat this year, they finally put Giannis on Butler at last. The trade for Jrue Holiday has paid off so much for them."
Jrue Holiday easily a top 10 pg right?
I wish the Knicks had Jrue holiday :(
Jrue Holiday is a defensive GOD
Its sucks that as soon as the Bucks got Jrue Holiday a super team formed. This Bucks team probably wins the East in 2019 and 2020
He's terrible. Ainge has got to find a way to get rid of him and find a Jrue Holiday lite or something.
"&gt; you mix the way the Clips ducked the Lakers this year, overvalued zubac, scapegoated doc and trez and I don't feel like basketball people are calling the shots.  While these are valid points, I would just like to add some context.   * Trezz was a huge defensive liability for us and his ego far exceeded his value to the team's success. I actually prefer the combination of Batum, Ibaka, and Rondo to Trezz, Jamychal Green, and Lou Will.  * PG and Doc were never going to get along, so one of them had to go (I would have rather traded PG for like Jrue Holiday or something).  * And yeah seems like Zubac doesn't have the BBIQ to really contribute as much as he could."
Jrue holiday  Chris Paul  Kyle Lowry   Ben Simmons  Mike Conley  Even Steph curry is able to play solid defense while running around a zillion screens
"On one hand I want the Heat to extend the series, on the other hand I love Jrue Holiday"
Jrue Holiday?
And I really should done a whole post on Jrue Holiday.  He’s so much better than I ever understood when he was with NO.  I am shocked how good his basketball IQ is.
Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton
"&gt;I was watching a break down of Jrue Holiday’s defence and during the Brooklyn game KD was intentionally passing the ball to Kyrie in the clutch of the fourth quarter because Jrue was on KD. You can even see him saying take it because Jrue switches on to KD making him give it to Kyrie instead.   &gt;   &gt;That's just insane to me that you're a guy like KD but you're still scared of certain defenders, that's how good Jrue Holiday is.   That's not being scared. That's being smart. If you have DiVincenzo on Kyrie and Jrue on KD, just let Kyrie go."
Pat Bev and 2015 Jrue Holiday lol.
Or jrue holiday!?
I remember when that chair made the All-Defensive team over Jrue Holiday...smh.
"No, the biggest difference is having Jrue holiday instead of Eric Bledsoe"
"If that player were Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons, Giannis or Bam Adebayo I'd give them a chance, if it has to be someone else from their roster that's gonna be a no from me, dawg.  Also the Celtics need a 6th player on offense, preferably Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic or Damian Lillard"
"NOLA Hornets Pelicans  PG: 07-08 Chris Paul  SG: 18-19 Jrue Holiday  SF: 02-03 Jamal Mashburn  PF: Present Day Zion Williamson  C: 17-18 Anthony Davis  Notable Omissions: Davis West, Baron Davis, Peja, Tyson Chandler, Brandon Ingram, Demarcus Cousins"
"I mean they're playing really good constructed teams for starters.   Also each of the teams with great 2-way wings either has that same player be the best playmaker in the world (LeBron), or they have another playmaker on the roster (Jrue Holiday).   Luka is the playmaker and also a solid wing, well he's not as good defensively as he is offensively but he's phenomenal as a playmaker."
"The elite two-way wing archetype is solid as long as you also have a great playmaker. Otherwise you get that nonsense where every possession is one of them isoing and usually wasting the possession.   We saw the same thing on the Celtics, we also have two-way elite wings in Brown and Tatum yet our offense is so predictable right now because we don't have a good playmaker on the team. Look how much better the Bucks got with Jrue Holiday for example.  I don't think the money would work, but if the Clippers had someone like Lowry/Rubio that would be a great step in the right direction for them. Or really anyone who can pass the ball around to generate the best looks for guys like Kawhi/PG13."
Those picks came from the Jrue Holiday deal.. you know?   Since you guys need better perimeter defense. If only NO had a really amazing perimeter defender... what if  And what if they didn’t have Bledsoe? I wonder how this universe could exist
"Plenty of elite defensive point guards could take matchups on 6'7 superstars. Marcus Smart, Rajon Rondo, Jason Kidd, Jrue Holiday."
Yeah he's a good player and he showed out but y'all acting like overcoming fans chanting Fuck Trae Young is like he overcame Jrue Holiday on defense
3x all defense is voted on by media who don’t really understand how to accurately grade defense; they go off reputation or looking at teams’ defensive ratings  Bev is a good defender but not an elite one. You can’t convince me Pat Bev deserved All D over Jrue Holiday last year
Definitely. People don't understand what a difference maker having Jrue Holiday is tho. But nobody wants to talk about how good the bucks can be bc the last two seasons. But having Jrue makes a championship difference.
"I would argue the opposite: the fact that Pat Bev is such an asshole and other players hate him has led fans to *significantly* underrate his defense.  Beverly is legitimately a great defender against other guards. His size just makes him vulnerable to being hunted on switches.  All the numbers support him being a good defender, and there have been a number of games where he's turned crucial possessions with his defense.  Is he Jrue Holiday or Ben Simmons? No. But he's a really good defender and he's elite when confined to the right role."
"Eh Jrue Holiday put the absolute clamps on Dame Dolla, idk wtf is happening with the clips"
"this dude here trying to claim pat bev is a better defender than jrue holiday or kyle lowry. but everyone else is dumb.   pat bev is pretty good on ball when against quick guards. that's about it though. overrated as fuck because he got under kd's skin a few years back and espn decided to make it a story.  it's questionable if he should even start in this league, much less for a team with finals aspirations."
"Honestly, if you want a pointguard to defend Luka well then you need Ben Simmons or Jrue Holiday."
And the goat Jrue Holiday
" &gt;You don't make the all-defensive team 3 times by accident.  Nah it's a joke. Bledsoe and Jrue Holiday. It's what the media sees. Winning teams will showcase and overrate supporting cast. Beverly is an annoying PG and has hustle, but physically isn't that impressive. He is all heart."
"&gt; You think that they would win more with Galo and SGA?  Yes, absolutely.  SGA is already putting up Paul George-like numbers on OKC (though to be fair numbers are skewed by him being the best player on a terrible team).  Hindsight is 20/20, but if they had been able to keep their picks they could have traded a few of them for Jrue Holiday (who would have been an incredible fit on this team) and then perhaps a few more for a better PF than Marcus fucking Morris."
And CP3 on the Suns. Harden on the Nets. Every contender needs an elite playmaker that can dominate in the slower halfcourt playoff offense. Hell even Jrue Holiday is a great playmaker for the Bucks. Way better than Bledsoe.
"Beverley can be a good defender and still be mismatched with Luka, especially in small ball situations where there's no center in the lineup to play help. Joel Embiid would absolutely destroy Jrue Holiday 1v1 but that doesn't mean Holiday is a bad defender."
trading away jrue holiday is honestly the biggest blunder in nba history. in an intense playoff race u got the 6'8 black morty from rick and morty playing like ben simmons or draymond green as a compliment to another star who can’t shoot. meanwhile jrue ain’t no pussy bitch he be bombing away that shit at a 40% clip. the pelicans woulda made the playoffs if they didn’t trade jrue holiday away for a 6’0 cheerleader that thinks he deserves to be on the all-defensive team when he’s outta the league in 3 years but now they gonna lose zion
jrue holiday one of the best perimeter defenders now + did u watch what bucks did to miami on 3s last game?
It’s just a different situation. Giannis had to be on ball so much last year because our pg was Eric Bledsoe. Khris Middleton could handle part of the load but he’s really not strong enough to run the offense all the time. Having Jrue Holiday instead of Bledsoe allows Giannis to spend even more time off ball and Middleton to shift to more of a scorer role than creator role.
"You're giving Coach Bud a little too much credit when it's mostly been Jrue Holiday locking Jimmy Butler up. I watched the games, Jimmy couldn't do anything against Jrue 1 on 1."
I’m gonna count the NO Hornets era   PG: CP3 SG: Jrue Holiday SF: Zion PF: David West C: AD
"Is there some way we could have Jrue Holiday, and OG Anunoby play defence on each other? at the same time?? to definitively settle this??? If Jrue is guarding OG - while Ogugua is guarding Jrue - can either player TRULY score? Maybe, if anything, it rips a tear in the NBA multiverse. I don't know. We'd have to try."
"How this dude won an all-defense second team selection over Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, and Jimmy Butler last year I'll never know."
Jrue Holiday has a strength rating of 49 in 2K. Tyler Hero has a strength rating of 59.
"Campazzo doesn't space the floor well enough to fit with Aaron Gordon.  Jamal Murray's on- and off-ball gravity really unlock Gordon's offense. Murray and Gordon screening for each other off-ball was killer because Jamal's a physical screen-setter and a shooting threat, and Gordon is big and strong enough that you can't switch Jamal's guy onto him.  My tin-foil theory about Campazzo is that our FO reached out to him assuming that we would put Monte Morris in a Jrue Holiday trade (and re-sign Grant), and didn't want to go back on their word when the trade fell through. Because he'd have been a nasty bench guard to run alongside either Murray or Jrue."
"Detroit was.     The Pel's is not ""shitty"" you are right, but they underachieved by 3-4 wins lets not act like this team was ready to win a playoff series. The best player is 20 and had played 25 games headed into this season. They are one of the worst 3pt shooting teams in the league. All their role players are either over the hill or rookies/sophomores. The team replaced Jrue Holiday with Eric Bledsoe, who had the worst year of his career. JJ redick went from 15ppg on 64 TS% to benched and traded for a second round pick and James Johnson (who was legitimately better for the pels than JJ was this year)."
Jrue Holiday is great
Jrue Holiday does this too
"The only real hit the roster took was replacing Jrue Holiday with Eric Bledsoe but that's a **big** hit.  Reddick became trash overnight and Favors moved on.  Other than that the roster wasn't too much of an improvement or downgrade, since the young players did improve somewhat but I wouldnt go on to say ""much improved"""
THIS!!!     You can visibly see Bam Adebayo's confidence get shattered in a bazillion pieces in the first 5 minutes of the game.      Also the fact that Giannis is playing off the ball so well and the Jrue Holiday for Eric Bledsoe have made this a much more threatening team than last year.
It is good thing they were able to offload his contact and their other assets for Jrue Holiday.
"Jrue Holiday has been playing excellent defense as well. I don't know what's up with Jimmy, in Game 1 he had room to drive but was settling for jumpers, and last night he was refusing to shoot and the only time he drove was directly into a crowded paint area or PJ Tucker's chest."
Who the hell expected Bledsoe to be Jrue Holiday 😂
Coach Bud also has a much better player in Jrue Holiday vs Bledsoe.

Jrue Holiday is a problem on D
Jrue Holiday is simply 2 bledsoes in a trench coat. So no.
"I would think black owned businesses would mean African Americans. Black has become synonymous with African Americans nowadays. That is a decent point though. British American specific charities would be totally fine. I don't see the issue there at all. European there may be more of an issue unless it's strictly European and not just originally from Europe, ie white people. You also have to consider context, the context of black Americans currently and their situation, ie having a lot less businesses and a lot less wealth, much more people in poverty, and jrue holiday being a black American himself, it makes complete sense why he would do that. It's funny, on reddit you hear alot of 'black people need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, they need to fix their community!!'. Then someone like jrue tries to do this by investing/donating to black businesses, which in turn is going to help those communities, and then people like the people in this thread will turn around and have an issue with this as well. Kinda seems like any sort of change from the status quo is an issue. Doomed if you do, doomed if you don't.   I'll say this, if Connor mcGregor were to come out and donate to Irish businesses, I wouldn't care at all. More power to him."
That’s a little bit harder when you don’t have jrue holiday rondo and Anthony Davis. You really expect jokic to be able to move around like that?
Jrue Holiday is the answer to both
I believe in jrue holiday supremacy
Jrue Holiday truly is what Eric Bledsoe thought he was.  Good on the Bucks for getting rid of him. Now if only the Pelicans could
People talking about bubble as if the heat didn’t lose Jae crowder and KO and the bucks didn’t add jrue holiday.
Jrue Holiday is a top 20 player in this league and it isn't said enough  Honestly in hindsight should have gotten the all star nod over Khris
Jrue Holiday is what Bucks fans hoped Bledsoe would be and more
This man Jrue Holiday is so fucking solid
"If you watch Jrue Holiday closely, you can see how he’s a step above everyone else."
This year’s Jrue Holiday is last year’s Jimmy Butler
Jrue Holiday is a beautiful human being
"Yeah, yall need a Bucks-style shakeup. They bet their future by trading for Jrue Holiday - and the results so far are positive. Plus, with Giannis signing an extension they no longer have that sword hanging over their heads for a while."
[Never forget this hilarious misunderstanding with Jrue Holiday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ef9fdd/jewish_woman_at_blazers_game_on_hanukkah_night/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
I will always have love for Jrue Holiday. Never heard a bad word about him too.
Jrue Holiday was giving Dame nightmares
Further support for my theory that Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley are the same person
"Why are you expecting a straight swap between an All NBA and not even an All Star player? Jrue Holiday went for 3 picks, CJ and Picks man."
"I do think the Bucks are going to win, but it won't be easy. The Nets have a ton of talent, but imo the Bucks match up really well with the Nets big 3.  And the Nets don't have the type of defense or roster to keep Giannis in check like the Heat and Raptors did the last two years.  This series is all on Giannis. Can he make the next step, take his game to the next level? Can he guard KD primarily AND dominate the paint on the other end? Time for the DPOY level superstar to step up his game in the biggest moment.  We'll see. But I think the addition of Jrue Holiday makes this Bucks team a lot better. Giannis the last few years had pretty inconsistent help (Middleton only shows up against the Celtics). But Jrue is legit as fuck.  Bucks aren't a one trick pony anymore."
"I want to establish some criteria for how I choose these players. Underrated to me means unrecognized winning equity. In other words, players in situations where their absence would substantially hurt their team's winning/play off record but are not largely recognized by casuals, media, forums, etc.  There isn't any order to this, but I did try to keep it current...  Don Mitchell (and almost all of the Jazz except Gobert), Malcom Brogdon, Jrue Holiday, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Vucevic are the first to come to mind.  I'd also like to add that Jokic gets a lot of hate, but that dude is the whole reason Denver is staying afloat. His hate to me makes him seem underappreciated if not underrated. People are acting like his MVP is by default, but he's a worthy MVP regardless of who got injured. Embiid went out and the 76ers were still beating people. If Jokic went down, it is safe to assume the nuggets would have lost about every game."
"I'm taking the team with three legendarily efficient, nearly unstoppable scorers over the team that's like, ""If Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday can hit enough shots, maybe ..."""
I would've said Jrue Holiday a month or so ago but it seems like people are starting to recognize how good he is
"Turning Eric ""net negative in the playoffs"" Bledsoe into Jrue ""really good in the playoffs"" Holiday was a huge upgrade."
That'd be Jrue Holiday
These “spacing for Zion” takes are all crap. He shot fucking 61% from the field. New Orleans doesn’t have a spacing problem. They have a severe “lack of good players” problem.   Bledsoe has to go. They need to leverage all those draft picks they have in order to get some actual talent into the team. Ironically the exact player that the Pelicans need is Jrue Holiday. A perimeter defender who can score and run the offense.
Nobody's watching the finals for Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday
Reggie bullock is the new jrue holiday
Jrue Holiday is good but you really think he’s an MVP candidate? Thanks man.
To be fair the double did work against him vs the pelicans with jrue holiday. Although it was actually a box and one if you’re familiar with the term. Probably the only time Ive seen it used in the nba and it was in a playoff series.
before the pelican bucks trade it would’ve been Jrue Holiday as the most realistic but idk
"Dude, the bucks had two long off seasons on a row. This last one was terrible with people kicking the Jrue Holiday signing, Bogdonavic falling through, losing to the Heat and all their trash talk along with signing Giannis.  Shit was rough. Any attempt to improve ourselves was met with “poverty franchise”. The Heat deserve all this shit to #coalesce on them."
"because I'd rather have Jrue Holiday when I'm building a contender, not a team to get eliminated first round"
Jrue Holiday. Westbrook has been an actively bad postseason player for years now.
Jrue Holiday
"I think that's harder to do nowadays with social media. If someone is playing incredibly they'll usually get their piece, but tbf jrue holiday and zach lavine didn't get much discussion last year when they should have."
"The bucks have Giannis who is top 5, a 2X mvp, and is better defensively than brown. You’re making my point. Giannis is god tier so his number 2 doesn’t have to be nearly as good. He makes up for the talent gap. And what did the bucks do to make themselves better? Added a 3rd guy (jrue holiday) who is close if not on par with Middleton-their existing number 2.   That’s the point- Tatum is nowhere near Giannis, so Tatums wingman had to be way better than Giannis’. And tbh the gap between Middleton and brown is not all that large (although I give brown the slight edge).   Like you really just made my point. The Celtics need to add someone that can fight with brown as to who can be the number 2 guy, they shouldn’t add someone that is clearly a #3. Because (like Middleton was for the bucks as you mentioned) brown is not a good enough number two to close the gap with teams that have a better number 1 than Tatum."
"I actually agree in principle, but my line is much further than KOC's. I probably **would** take him over Steven Adams going into the 2021-2022 season. But definitely not Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Jrue Holiday, or some of the other players in this list.  As a proximation, there are probably 60-90 players I'd take over Stevens. But at a certain point, I'd take him over some player at their contract.  And for a coach like Nurse, it might be closer to 40-70."
this question isn't about Jrue Holiday

"It’s missing Jrue Holiday, who posted an absurd +98 in 4 games against the Heat"
"Curry winning a title with Klay and Dray is not that far off from Giannis hypothetically winning with Jrue and Holiday.    All 4 are all Stars but not superstars.   Then you add in Curry's 2 other titles, 2 MVP's, status as GOAT shooter, and how changed basketball, I don't see it as close."
"Very true. With that said, he’s still not jokic in terms of passing like OP says. I witnessed what the jrue holiday playoff box and one did to him. Jokic has the vision but also the size and footwork to just pickup his dribble and hold the ball away from the defender until his read comes. Dame can be amazing without him being the best passer, and the debates that try and make one guy “the perfect player” outside of Lebron are lame."
"True, Milwaukee is not a premier spot that other stars are clamoring to sign or trade to... but they *were* able to extend Middleton long-term, who is definitely a star, as well as add Jrue Holiday (who also agreed to an extension), who also meets the definition of a star IMO. I get what you’re saying, but it’s not like Milwaukee has had an issue bringing talent to the team. And I feel like they would’ve been able to add Bogdan this year as well if the Kings and the Bucks didn’t bungle the whole situation. I can’t imagine how good that team would be right now with him on it..."
"Offensively probably yes. Defensively, I don’t think so. Beal is not Jrue Holiday but he certainly is a better defender than CJ."
"They should've done this two years ago.   Keep Covington, Powell, and maybe Simons + DJJ for the right prices. Nurkic could probably stay, but I'm not sure if he's the optimal rim protector you want.   Try and snag Myles Turner, if Indiana is giving up. Get a Jrue Holiday type guy, hell maybe Marcus Smart is available. Do what you gotta do. Stop wasting Dame's fucking time. He's stupidly loyal for some reason."
"To be honest....... Jrue Holiday isn't *that* far away from a Kyrie Irving. What he lacks in offense he makes up for in defense. Yes, Harden/KD is a clearly better #2 than Middleton (who is still a great player).  It depends on the rest of the team makeup. Do the Bucks have enough on the rest of their roster to overcome what they lose in their top 3?"

His defense sinks us on so many possessions. I've been ready to move on from CJ for years. I wanted Jrue Holiday for years too...
"Portland would have to give up a shit ton of picks if they want Siakam, even with trading CJ, jrue holiday type package."
"Giannis has been MVP two straight years, Jrue Holiday is one of the best two way players in the league, and Middleton is also very good, I like the other pieces they have as well. So to say they have a 0% chance is just silly."
"Lol Milwaukee had to give up 3 firsts, Bledsoe, and George hill to get Jrue Holiday. What in the world makes you think Miami will give up Jimmy buckets for a fringe role player and 2 firsts??"
"&gt;Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance  I don't think Jrue was the solution, they needed forward depth not a second PG.  Hayward, Jae Crowder, Bobby Portis, etc are all good defensive forwards that Portland could have gone after in FA, hell even Tristan Thompson or even  Dwight or Javale could have been good defensive backup centers. Trades aside, they had options and just didn't pursue anything. It's honestly baffling.  Then there's trades. I'm confident they could've traded for some good defensive 3&amp;D forwards from rebuilding teams like Taurean Prince or Kelly Olynik, not to mention guys like PJ Tucker or Aaron Gordon who got picked up by contenders for basically nothing. Gary Trent Jr is literally a better defender than Powell and they packaged that trade with picks which to this day still makes no sense.  Sorry Portland fans, you guys have an atrociously lazy FO"
We should have traded for jrue holiday when it was there. Jrue and dame would have been a much better fit
Jrue Holiday. Instead Neil payed CJ 30 mil a year to average 20 points and not play defense.
"We fucking triple team him, call Jrue Holiday, Let him pass to CJ, and pray"
Summon Jrue Holiday
Norm is a decent defender but having Dame + CJ + Norm as your backcourt is so limiting on defense. None of those guys are plus defenders  Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance
Always thought they should have went after Jrue Holiday
"&gt; Why strike out like we constantly have with Durant and Giannis when you can secure two cornerstones and find ways to improve the team by either adding a third piece or working trades?  In 23-24, Jrue Holiday will be getting paid $35 million to be the third star on the Bucks. Jrue and AD couldn't even manage a winning record.  Jimmy just took a team to the finals as the number 1. Not many guys could do that.   There are not many guys worth $50 right now, but in a few years that number will not look that bad."
Playoff Jrue Holiday is a thing
"&gt; he's not worth 50m a year now and won't be in the future  He might be, but probably not for title favorite. Look at the guys leading the league in salary.   In 23-24, Jrue Holiday will be getting paid $35 million to be the third star on the Bucks. Jimmy just took a team to the finals as the number 1. Not many guys could do that. Jrue and AD couldn't even manage a winning record."
"Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton says no"
"Bucks are the only team that can beat the nets, jrue holiday can slow down harden, Giannis can lock up kd"
"&gt; it's extremely close to the same team.   Not really. Loss of important guys, age related decline, it’s a completely different team.  &gt; Jae Crowder isn't an elite 3 pt shooter.   He’s inconsistent. But the fact remains that he shot 43% from 3 against the Bucks.  &gt;He got hot last year and then cooled off dramatically  He really didn’t. Man was cold during the Lakers series, averaging out his shooting vs the Bucks and Celtics.  &gt;I guess if those were your most important players your team should've kept them.   Not really. But even if they were, I’m not the front office so maybe try telling Riley that instead of me.  &gt;The truth is the Bucks just exposed the Heat and spanked em raw. And those three guys weren't changing that  Exposed what exactly? That the 2021 Bucks were better than us? Because last I recall they added really good shooters on top of replacing negative Bledsoe with borderline all star Jrue Holiday. It’s not exactly the same team isn’t it? It’s not exactly the Heat lost due to these “marginal players” as much as the Bucks new additions were key for them. Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis shot over 46% from 3, and Holiday averaged a near triple double."
"I've always got to find teams to support in the playoffs after round 1, because the mavs haven't won a series in 10 years. I'm hoping the bucks can clutch it out. I love the loyal superstar staying and winning for the city trope. and i love the dudes on the bucks too, like love everything jrue holiday is about"
"Disagree heavily, guys like Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry are the most underrated impactful players of the last decade, Mike Conley and Jrue Holiday should be added to that group as well.   Everybody gets that LeBron is the best player without understanding *why* he's the best player. What is LeBron's best skill? It's his passing.   The players with elite basketball intelligence, which is often correlated with how good of a playmaker you are, is the most underappreciated skill in basketball. Contrary to popular belief, you can't really teach basketball IQ, that intrinsic feel for the game that playmakers like LeBron, Luka, Jokic, Trae, CP3, Harden etc. have, you kinda either have it or you don't."
"After that second game I was hoping we get swept and go to the off season with 0 injuries. Bucks winning without Giannis being the carry is extremely acceptable. They are an insane team and Jrue holiday is godlike on both ends of the court. Hope we can offload Oladipo and pick up players similar to DJJ, Olynyk and Crowder. Every matchup was a disaster in the current heat lineup."
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
I think Nurk is the second best player on the Blazers. Harris might be better than Simmons at this point. I’d probably do a lineup of:  Kyrie Irving  Jrue Holiday  Andrew Wiggins  Kyle Anderson (or any 3&amp;D PF)  Ayton
Yeah this seriously fucked up my bracket.  After what happened last year I decided to go with Bucks in 5.  Screwed that one up.  Heat fans thinking last year was repeatable AND ignoring that Jrue fucking Holiday joined the Bucks were some of the silliest people on this Subreddit coming into the playoffs.
here’s my issue with that;  Bucks have a good offense as it is but vs the Nets they will get offensive rebounds+own the paint and an elite defense   Nets have a subpar-bad defense by playoff standards and an elite offense and they have to be lights out with jumpers vs a team that has Giannis and Jrue Holiday defending
Except that's not what's happened.  Nuggets just added talent.  The Bucks ended up better with Jrue Holiday.  The Jazz have continued to add talent to their rebuild after Hayward (and arguably with better stars than Hayward ever was).
"Jrue Holiday has a +\- of +98 rn so imma go him. I know it isn’t the greatest stat, but the difference between last years bucks and this years bucks can almost be attributed solely to Jrue."
Jrue Holiday
"Yep, that’s literally the only thing that changed. Both rosters were otherwise identical, as were the game plans, and nobody got any better or worse. Players who were in good form remained in good form and players in poor form remained in poor form. It was just Jrue Holiday."
Jrue Holiday might be the most overrated player in the NBA with how many people call him underrated
"i think milwaukee can match up better than anyone defensively with jrue, middleton, and giannis. obviously with these caliber scorers it comes down to team defense, but it will be a big step going from romeo langford checking kyrie to jrue holiday."
Why would you bring up Jrue Holiday in a playoff injury context tho...
"I’ve been saying on r/Heat all year, and subsequently being aggressively shit on by our fans, that all of our competition got a lot better, but we only got a little worse. The freakin Knicks are in the playoffs and the fourth seed. The Hawks are in the playoffs and the fifth seed. The Wizards had a dope end of the season once Russ got healthy. The Sixers are legit title contenders. The Nets exist.  Everyone except the Heat (and Celtics) got noticeably better but we got worse. I don’t know why our sub, or other people, didn’t see that. We did nothing this offseason. Meanwhile, the Bucks added *Jrue Holiday* and PJ Tucker. Like, come on."
That’s Jrue Holiday
But it wasn't just Jrue Holiday that came in. Have you seen the bucks last year compared to now? I honestly think that you personally hate the heat or your just a casual and just following trend of calling the heat a bubble team without any real reason. This year they beat us in the season series like we did last year against them. This year they beat us in the playoffs like we did against them last year against them. What was the difference? Their team got better while ours got slightly worse.
"Honestly, Nets look better rn. Simmons can cook against Kyrie and he's a good defensive matchup on Harden. Tobi is best on mismatches, I do not want him to play against Jrue fucking Holiday."
"You're acting like Jrue Holiday is a 1st team all nba player lmao. Hes not even an all star. Adding Jrue Holiday is not enough of a difference to where the team that made the Finals gets swept in the first round. The Heat's success was because of the bubble. Butler is overrated. Tyler Herro is a bum. There is no ""Heat culture"". They are a bubble team. Just accept it."
Jrue Holiday had 15 assist and 2 TOs in game two.
Gotta be a 3-way tie with Jrue Holiday and Boban
Easy  They turned Eric Bledsoe into Jrue Holiday
Jrue holiday has 2 points on 1/6 split? Do these bucks stars just take turn to shit the bed?
What’s going on? I thought that Jrue Holiday was God compared to Eric Bledsoe.
Remember when people were saying Jrue Holiday was this miraculous savior of the Bucks?
Can’t tell if that’s Jrue Holiday or Eric Bledsoe
Brook Lopez...Jrue Holiday...PJ Tucker...IS ANYONE ALIVE OUT THERE?
"Watching these boys play make me really appreciate tge the scoring abilities of harden,curry, and kd. It really highlights the difference between stars like Middleton and jrue holiday."
"FUCKING BUCKS FUCK YOU BUD FUCK EVERYTHING  What is wrong with them??? They fucking had the Nets on the ropes - Drive, Drive, Drive - then decide to go ham with misguided threes and Jrue Holiday 12 second iso post ups?? What in the actual fuck??  I'm not even talking about falling for a Bruce Brown screen and roll for 4 straight possessions in a row, giving him 8 straight points.   Bud is killing this team, this is Mark Jackson level bad."
Holiday has been absolutely fucking dreadful this series.   How many times has he fumbled the ball now?  Where is playoff Jrue?
Jrue Holiday throwing smh
Jrue Holiday hasn’t been an all star in eight years and Middleton wasn’t an all star this year either. It’s an entirely different conversation than the perennial All-NBA candidates in Brooklyn and LA.
"First game was better, but I think that second game just doomed him tbh. I just don't see a way back because I don't even know what kind of adjustment Bud could make here to turn the series around. When you add the team's performance this year on top of how the Bucks lost season in the bubble.. I think the case for making a change is overwhelming. I could be wrong. I think this was Bud's last shot though because the FO can now sit back and say we delivered. Giannis extension? Done. Jrue Holiday? Done. Almost had Bogdon too until whatever the hell that was that happened back in in the Fall of 2020. Nothing short of a miraculous turnaround is going to keep Bud in Milwaukee past next week. JMO"
"They do have shooters. Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker were all intended to be complementary shooters to pair with Giannis’ interior scoring. It’s a coaching issue, and a Giannis ft issue."
"But at some point, the focus has to be on the players on the court. The coach can’t make the players lock up defensively or shoot lights out. Doesn’t matter if Greg Popovich was the coach of the Bucks. They’ve consistently improved the supporting cast year after year with disappointing results.   Jrue Holiday/Khris Middleton as co stars, a primeir 3/D center and a good bench. That is more than enough for the true superstars in the game, which is why I say Giannis’s accolades don’t match his true value. You simply have to perform at some point. If you have to get your best player “open looks”, they simply aren’t *that guy*."
"A Celtic insider called the BR article that came out yesterday saying both sides want to walk away and the Jrue Holiday trade  last offseason was total garbage and a lie, and Kemba says he just wants to get healthy for next year"
"That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Chris Paul moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday see the game from an x and o perspective, Chris has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event. There's a reason Chris was able to knock out LeBron James in the 2021 playoffs. Put simply, Chris Paul is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Ben Simmons or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Chris Paul's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like CP3, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Christopher."
"People need to stop using that Jrue trade. Jrue holiday is NOT worth 3 first round picks  Bucks had to overpay to get another star for Giannis so he could re-sign. Jrue in any other circumstance is not netting 3 FRPs. Similar to the PG trade to LA, Clippers overpaid to land Kawhi"
"Well deserved by Gobert. I just wish in such a superstar guard heavy league, they’d give more credit to the defensive guards instead of whoever is leading in blocks. Jimmy Butler led the league in steals but only got 2 third place votes. Jrue Holiday and Thybulle been great defensive guards but only got 6 and 1 third place votes respectively. Most team’s best or second best player is a guard. Not saying give them the award but they deserve better than a few pity third place votes."
"Superstars: Players in their prime that have won league MVP or played at an MVP level in the Regular Season, Playoffs, and/or both.   - Bron Bron  - KD - Jokic - Kawhi - Curry - Harden - Giannis  - Luka  - Street Clothes  - Kyrie  - Dame  - Embiid   Bron Bron:   &gt; Draymond Green   KD:  &gt;   Kawhi:  &gt; PJ Tucker (check the stats)   Curry:  &gt; Dillon Brooks cuz I can’t remember who else really slows him down 1v1   Harden:  &gt; Wes Matthews   Jokic:  &gt; DeAndre Ayton (No, it ain’t just recency bias nephews)   Giannis:  &gt; ~~The freethrow line~~ Just kidding, probably Jonathan Isaac   Embiid:  &gt; Marc Gasol aka Big Daddy Spain  Luka:  &gt; Porzingis   AD:  &gt; Draymond Green   Kyrie:  &gt; No idea. Any ideas?  Dame:  &gt; Jrue Holiday"
Lillard: Jrue Holiday
All I know is that Jrue Holiday and Matisse Thybulle absolutely erase Booker
So you think jrue holiday is going to get better? Tucker will probably sign with his boy harden next year and Portis is portis
"Jrue Holiday + Giannis Super max    and my favourite, getting rid of Drew Bledsoe."
"Because they don’t have a floor general capable or exploiting those mismatches. Zach Lowe just talked about it yesterday on his podcast. They have jrue holiday out there with weak defenders on him or someone else and he calls for useless screens that allow the nets to get more favorable switches.   The example he used was whenever holiday had shamet or kyrie on him, rather then calling for Giannis screen to exploit that mismatch he’d instead call for a screen and get Bruce brown switched onto him, and then call for Giannis screen making it much harder.   Middleton and holiday just aren’t floor generals or play makers. What they really should have done is gone after Chris Paul of Lowry. They’d know how and when to exploit weak defenders, and they have the capability to not let the other team hide its weaker defenders all game"
"This is correct and the same reason why the players almost all agree that Jrue Holiday is the best defender in the league, whilst the analyst and data guys all say it’s Gobert. For the same reason Draymond explained though, I would have voted for Ben Simmons if I had a DPOY vote."
"He's right. Can we finally stop hyping up Jrue Holiday and Middleton?   Giannis needs to play better. He should be averaging 30ppg against this Nets team, but people need to stop pretending like Jrue and Middleton are championship caliber 2nd and 3rd options. We've already seen Jrue with AD. Team went nowhere. I love Jrue. He's elite on defense, but too small to guard the best players in the league but his main issue is that he's not a real point guard which is what the Bucks needed. (they laughed at the idea of trading for CP3 when a player like him is what they need)"
"&gt; Sources close to the Celtics revealed Ainge sought to trade Walker, and Jrue Holiday was the target. Holiday ended up with the Milwaukee Bucks, who are now in the second round of the playoffs.  &gt; **A source close to Walker said he was hurt by Boston’s efforts to trade him, which created a rift in the Walker-Ainge relationship**. Walker has a great relationship with his teammates and looked forward to being a veteran mentor to Tatum and Brown, but the same can't be said about Walker and the front office. He no longer feels wanted.  This is why the Ainge resignation I feel is ultimately a good thing for the Celtics. His reputation has really taken a hit in recent years. And it’s hurting the Celtics internally and externally."
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
"He needs a coach that isn’t afraid to take the ball out of his hands. A Giannis size up at the three point line is a wasted possession every single time. Giannis should be killing teams in transition or being the roll man for screens.  Also getting jrue was a mistake. A solid player and great defender but what the bucks actually need is a real floor general like Lowry or cp3. Someone to orchestrate the offense and that can kill teams in that midrange area after the screen. The nets have decided they don’t care about jrue holiday on the pick and roll. If the bucks want to set a screen and have jrue shoot pull up mid range shots they consider that a win. They couldn’t do that against a Lowry or cp3 though.   Also jrue just isn’t the playmaker the other guys are. Zach Lowe the other day on his podcast pointed out jrue is making mistakes like calling for useless screens when he already has a weak defender on him (allowing a better defender to switch to him) before initiating the offense. He will have someone like shamet or kyrie on him, and instead of calling for the Giannis screen he has the guy Bruce brown is guarding set the screen and Bruce will get the switch. Then they try to initiate the pick and roll with a positive defender on the guard. Someone like cp3 would never make that mistake. They would instantly try to attack or initiate the desired pick and roll immediately when they have the weakest defender"
"I mean, Giannis at least played well in Game 1 of the Semifinals. Paul George, on the other hand...  Should also be noted that Paul George has better teammates than Giannis does (I'd take Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Lou Williams in a heartbeat over Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Brook Lopez)."
"Yes analytics guys like Ben Taylor also watch film and understand schemes. Still doesn’t change the fact that they were completely wrong about KD and Kyrie. Do you realize that the Nets were blowing out the Bucks by 49 points at one point? A Bucks team that has Jrue Holiday, Giannis, Khris Middleton along with Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, and other solid role players. There is a swagger to the game of basketball that dudes like Ben Taylor don’t understand. Kyrie and KD only combined for 54 points but the way in which they scored was amazing and effortless. It made the Bucks hesitant to play their gritty, physical style and they fell into the trap of trying to match KD and Kyrie’s coolness/ swagger/ shotmaking ability which very few can do. Not only that. When you see your teammates making highlight reel type plays every trip down the court it gives the teammates supreme confidence. Bruce Brown’s floater game was on another level. Landry Shamet banged two back to back laser beam three pointers.   In short, basketball is about confidence and when you have two of the most skilled scorers ever on your team who don’t let the ball stick in their hands then that confidence becomes infectious. There are no analytics for this. Ben Taylor probably knows this but chooses not to bring it up because again there are no analytics for this."

I think Bucks need to include jrue holiday to make it more fair
I keep hearing the Bucks won the off-season with the acquisition of Jrue Holiday
"Jrue Holiday has probably been our best player during this entire playoff run. The team is fine, it’s the coaching &amp; Giannis who both need to get better."
These Bucks are not an elite squad lol. It's like calling the Lebron Cavs team of 09/10 that won 66 games in the regular season an elite squad. It shows how young a lot of you are on here. Only player that you can consider as good enough to compete for a championship is Jrue Holiday and he would be the third/fourth option on a really good team. Middleton should not be the second best player on any contending team.
"Those guys weren't taking the types of shots Kobe was taking. They had better shot selection. Kobe was a much better tough shot-maker than any of those guys, apart from Lillard. Although I would only give Lillard the edge as an off the dribble three point shooter. Everything else, give me prime Kobe. We saw how Lillard got completely shutdown against the Pelicans defense that one year they had Jrue Holiday and Rondo hounding him."
"I once saw Jrue Holiday in person and went, ""Hey! Darren Collison!"" lol. He was not pleased. Earnest mistake."
Lol give harden Middleton and Jrue Holiday as his running mates against the warriors and he has 2 rings right now
"I think the thing with LeBron is that it's painfully obvious when he's trying on defense vs. not, and he coasts for long stretches during games/regular seasons.  When he wants to dial it up he can still be a destructive force on defense, he just picks his spots so it's tough to put him in the elite tier of dudes that go all-out on every possession and guard the opponent's best perimeter player consistently.  You don't see clips of someone like Kuzma having to push Jrue Holiday out to the perimeter to close out on a dude, nor do you see possessions where Thybulle or Dort spend the entire possession in the back-court bitching at the ref over a no-call.     Young LeBron was one of the best defenders I've ever seen, probably second only to KG, Duncan, MJ &amp; Pippen, I do believe that at his peak he was a better defender than Spurs era Kawhi even.  The fact that LeBron can still be an impactful defender in year 18 going at 60-70% effort at any given time is a testament to his greatness."
Jrue Holiday said one of the main reason he re-signed with the Bucks was because of Coach Bud. I agree with what you are saying but I also wouldn't be surprised if they do fire him based on how bad we have looked these last 2 games. If this was posted after the Heat series I would have said no chance he gets fired.
Lmfao  &gt;Schroder thinks he is an Allstar but he is really a poor poormans Jrue Holiday... and that's being complimentary  Since when is that a bad thing?
"Why is Giannis the primary ballhandler all the time anway? Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday should be handling the ball with Giannis as the roll man. Mike Budenholzer is a fuckin fraud, if he isn't fired the Bucks are hopeless."
"Lol yes i'm serious but you're entitled to your own opinion.  Durant &gt;&gt; Giannis  Kyrie &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Middleton  Sure, Jrue Holiday is &gt;&gt; Joe harris but the gap between the top two nets versus top two bucks is huge.  I'd also argue shammet, mike james, claxton are equal role players/bench to bryn forbes, bobby portis (LOL), and pat connaughton..."
Are you serious? The Bucks third best player is Jrue Holiday. The Nets third best player without Harden is Joe Harris. Jrue Holiday is better than Joe Harris. The Bucks have better role players and depth. That’s part of the reason why they were favored to win the series without Harden.
Lmaoooo omg are you wrong on this one? Schroder thinks he is an Allstar but he is really a poor poormans Jrue Holiday... and that's being complimentary. Duncan Robinson is a nuclear weapon on offense and improving on defense. Not bad for a late bloomer and undrafted player at that.
Jrue Holiday did fit that role against the Heat but it almost feels like the Bucks focused everything on trying to beat the Heat and neglected to address the other teams in the East.
I mean it's Jrue Holiday. Not John Wall. So it's a fair contract
"People have been saying this for a while now. He’s great in the regular season but when he’s in the playoffs against smart coaches who know how to scheme, he’s not as dominant. He’s been needing an elite shot creator and playmaker to help in the playoffs. Middleton is good but it’s clear that he’s not THAT guy. It’s crazy how this sub thought Jrue Holiday would fit that role."
I really thought Milwaukee would match up a lot better than expected but then I remembered that Middleton is a bum who can't get to the rim and relies on making tough shots. Giannis 2-7 from the line is unreal and jrue holiday was guarding like he walks doing a Jordan farmarr impersonation
"Blame is on everyone from top to bottom.  Bud:  \- Stupid defensive schemes. Running a simple zone against a team with 3 of the best shooters in the league is idiotic. When he doesn't run that zone, he runs a drop coverage with Lopez and they end up getting destroyed by the PnR ball handler which is either Kyrie or KD.   \- Stupid offensive schemes, he's basically still relying on Giannis drive &amp; kick when it's failed them for 2 STRAIGHT seasons dating back to 2019. Let Giannis be a roller off the pick and role and have Jrue/Middleton make some plays. The Bucks didn't get Jrue Holiday so he can be a 3&amp;D guy.  \- Doesn't play Giannis enough. This has been a recurring issue for 3 straight seasons now. I can't say much about game 2, but there is zero reason for a guy coming back from an Achilles injury to play 5 more minutes than your best player.   \- Anybody with a brain knew that Lopez was going to get destroyed defensively this series, zero adjustments coming from Bud of course as Lopez is still getting major minutes.   Giannis:  \- He needs to DEMAND more playing time when his coach sits him for too long. You see KD telling his coach to put him back in when the Nets had a couple of bad offensive possessions in game 1, that's what you need from Giannis as well.   \- He hasn't improved at all in the past couple of season on his major weaknesses. Still no scoring arsenal outside of the paint, no post moves, no 3, bad FTs, no off ball improvement.   \- A lot of the stuff from Bud can be said for Giannis as well, so I won't repeat myself here.  Front Office:  I think the front office has done a fine job at putting together a good roster, but I just feel like they lack leadership and experience. Jrue Holiday was a fine acquisition, but he's really not that type of takeover/leadership type of player the Bucks really needed IMO. I know hindsight is 20/20 but I can't imagine the Bucks playing pathetically like this had they traded for CP3 instead.   With that said, your contention window is obviously much shorter with CP3 since he's much older. But I do think they would've had a better chance this year and the next with CP at the helm."
"yea the sixers would have been better off if they had just ran with Jrue Holiday, Evan Turner, and Spencer Hawes. I'm sure the revenues would've been rolling in. Maybe if they even drafted Exum instead of Embiid! Two more years of revenue!"
"Stop paying attention to this guy, he looks like a fool for focusing on all the semantics when it's perfectly clear what you mean. He can't adress the elephant in the room that Giannis has been underperforming heavily in the post season for 2 straight years after having had a historic regular season last year.   People claimed the Bucks roster on pace to 70 wins pre-covid was the most well-rounded roster in the NBA - Brook Lopez was elite defensively and stretched the floor really well, Brogdon Beldsoe are above average starters, George Hill shot 50% from 3 in the fall of his career and brought great Vet presence and so on. Giannis performed so well in the regular season setting we thought he would be the player next in line after Bron KD Harden and Steph cooled down eventually. So he has to be viewed with the same eyes as them. But what he shows in the regular season or first round EC playoffs doesn't translate to the first opponent that poses a tricky matchup.  He still has a very balanced roster around him, Jrue Holiday was everybody's dark horse darling and rightly so. This is a team good enough for a finals run but they can't execute once Giannis faces some problems on offense. It has to be on him at some point. His vision isn't developed enough, his fundamentals are very much lacking. He has all the talent to be an all-timer but it has to happen during the playoffs at some point. This being said I'm not writing him off at all and still think Giannis will be truly unstoppable given time but the likes of Bron KD Harden Steph or Kawhi/Luka/AD/Jokic always put up a fight and are capable of dominating singular games so much they will their teams to a W against eventual champions or other all-time great talent. And this is something Giannis hasn't been able to prove yet and right now it looks like he's folding yet again against the first real threat in his post season run.   I'm tired of people bringing up his post season stats inflated by weak EC first and second round opponents. Even against the Heat people claimed 21 points on 54%TS with a load of rebounds was Giannis being ""good in the series"". It just doesn't cut it."
"Obviously Giannis and Bud are to blame, but I also think there roster construction is a bit off.  What I would want with Giannis is a pick and roll initiator. Middleton and holiday are both essentially iso guys. It turns Giannis into an iso guy.  And as an extension to that, they basically gave up more for jrue holiday than the nets gave up for harden. Holiday is good, but that was such a panic trade and if let’s just say they traded for harden he would have legitimately transformed them"
"I mean, I’d take current Holiday over Westbrook and probably in the last 3 years too, but any version of prime Westbrook from 2011-2017 &gt;&gt; any version of Jrue.   There’s a pretty big difference between a top 10 player in the league to a player who’s top 30 in the league. The equivalent difference today would be Damian Lillard vs. Jrue.    I guess Middleton doesn’t seem far off from 2012 Harden, but Harden in 2013 proved he was a top 10-15 player when given the reigns—which Middleton is not.    The oddsmakers slightly favored the 2012 Thunder over the Heatles.    Anyways, I think the 2012 OKC Thunder are a good margin better than this 2021 Bucks roster. I don’t know if I’d describe them as extremely close. The Bucks roster is very good, though. The 2012 OKC Thunder were just simply better. They ran through the West: sweeping the defending champion Mavericks, crushing the Lakers in 5, and beating an extremely good Spurs team in 6.    It’s the world #2, a top 12 player, and a top 25 player + DPOY-runner up Ibaka vs. a top 10 player, two top 25ish players, and Lopez (who’s very good in his own right).   The 2012 OKC Thunder were truly the definition and perhaps the pinnacle of a young super team. They just happened to run into a better and more experienced super team led by LeBron, Wade, and Bosh. Some folks at OKC’s FO were also just too dumb to see what they had in Harden. I also think it’s highly disappointing they failed to win even after Harden left, but shit happens."
"Everybody blaming Bud but its obvious that Bucks stars are overrated especially against elite competition. **This roster is not beating Nets with other coaches**. Sorry Giannis, you shouldn't resigned. Giannis joining Mavs would solve all the problems for him as he'd create the difference on defense and interior finishing while Doncic do the playmaking.  1- Giannis for instance, dominates the game against most teams. But when he actually faces elite athleticism, star power in the other side, his effectiveness plummets. Because he relies on his athleticism and strength. In the bubble last year, Dallas beated Bucks pretty easily. Doncic was the scorer who Giannis could not stopped. And KP's length, Carlisle's defensive adjustment killed Giannis effectiveness.  Embiid-Jokic also relies on their strength for low post plays but they also have a great skill set. And they have more mass so it becomes harder to put a wall against them or finding a defender for them.  2- Middleton is a legit 2nd option, but not a good one. He's certainly behind of Harden-Kyrie so he can't create much difference. He is no D.Booker or B.Beal.  3- Jrue Holiday was always a fools gold in terms of being allstar player. His worse version, Josh Richardson played for Dallas Mavs this season. So called two-way guards are overrated in this league. Because for the most cases, two-way guards offense are decent at best. And then on defense, they cannot defend elite wing men. Against KD's height, Harden's , Kawhi's, Lebron's drives, JRUE would never have answer. He's not that good of 3rd option.  We all know Kyrie would make shots against any kind of defense. KD is literally an unstoppable force when he is healthy. Harden singlehandedly brought his team to multiple WCF and made them contenders, he is that good as well. Without Harden they still have 2 elite players and rejevuanated Blake."
But wasn’t a lot of media types hyping up Jrue Holiday last week?
Honestly. How good did dudes think Jrue Holiday was lmao. Solid PG and elite defender (arguably best) at guard position…….. but theres levels man do u see kai and KD out there😂
"Jrue Holiday has 27 games worth of postseason experience in his entire career prior to this year.  Anyone thinking he was the ""clutch playoff guy with experience"" is fucking stupid.  Giannis had more playoff experience coming into this year and had made it deeper than Jrue ever had."
"Jrue Holiday tricked yall man, everyone said he would play defense but he's just running around doing nothing, he don't guard nobody"
"I kept trying to tell people fans were just trying to hype themselves up into thinking anyone has a chance against the Nets. People would say ""oh they don't have a rim protector"", MF you really out here thinking you need defense when you have KD, Harden, and Kyrie?   People were really out here convincing themselves Giannis, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday were gonna compete against Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Got me fucked up.  I will say one thing I was wrong about, I said the Bucks have a chance if one of the big 3 gets injured but right now it's looking like that's not even true."
"Jrue Holiday is 100% good enough to be the third best player on a championship team. If you don’t agree with that then idk what to tell you. Middleton has had his struggles in the playoffs and is extremely streaky so I’d be fine exploring trades, but we’d have to get another top 25 player back in return (preferably a true PG, let Jrue play the 2)  The biggest thing the team can do is fire Bud and play Giannis at the 5 with a proper PG to feed him.  Anyway, even if this team isn’t good enough to win a title (I firmly believe they are, just not against this stacked Brooklyn team) at least we’re perennial contenders. It’s not like we’re stuck in mediocrity struggling to get the 8 seed every year."
Great offense &gt; jrue holiday
Do you think it's a coincidence that Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are finding it hard to score?  Giannis fucks up the spacing and is a mediocre playmaker
Jrue Holiday is nice but expecting him to guard Kyrie or KD or Harden is too much
People thought he was the answer to their offensive problems (lol) as if he's an elite shooter or ball handler. He's good at both of those things but not good enough. You don't really want Jrue Holiday running your offence.
"The Bucks second or third best players are #3s on any true championship caliber team. This was so predictable. I didn’t expect these games to be blowouts but the people that think the 76ers and Bucks are comparable to the Nets. They’re not.   It’s a star league. The Nets have the best two in the conference. Why do people think that Joel and Ben Simmons of all people have a shot? Why do people think the bucks are going anywhere with Kris Middleton as their second best player? Or Jrue Holiday? If any of those players outside of Embiid ever scored 30 in a playoff game, those cities would throw a parade.   NBA fans do this crap every single year and it’s so comical. It’s a star driven league. Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday…those aren’t stars. Ben Simmons is not a star. This was the expected result.   Nobody should have predicted blowouts in the first two games but Khris Middleton? Jrue Holiday? They score 30 in any game and it’s like a miracle."

We got Jrue holiday stop it lil bro
remember when Jrue Holiday said he should be DPOY every year?  LOL
"I seriously overestimated milwaukee.  Without Harden, I thought bucks would feast.  I thought Jrue Holiday and Kris Middleton would be lethal, and that brooklyn wouldnt have an answer for giannis.  I also did not expect griffin, mike, clax to be so damn effective.  Glad to see I was wrong for both haha"
I don’t get how anyone could watch this game and single out Jrue Holiday lol makes no sense
The Bucks' Point Guard Jrue Holiday only has 3 assists. People are correct that he is really a Shooting Guard and not a good primary ball handler.
"nah, it's REGULAR SEASON GIANNIS, Jrue ""On Holiday"" and Khris ""no effort"" middleton"
Jrue Holiday honestly is the Bucks best postseason offensive player. They need to unleash him as a passer cause Middleton and Giannis both are way too one dimensional in different ways.
Blake would be the 4th best player on the Bucks. Just like he's the 4th best player on the Nets. He's not better than Giannis (obviously) he's not better than Middleton (a fucking allstar) and he's not better than Jrue Holiday (easily one of the best defensive guards in basketball who can also score and facilitate)
"Realistically, there is no way Bud keeps his job after this season. Imagine being the GM of the team, assembling this roster, signing Jrue Holiday, miraculously dumping the contracts of Eric Bledsoe and DJ Augustine, and STILL getting smashed."
Is Jrue holiday ball dominant? CJ's numbers and playmaking ability improve a ton when Dame is out with injury I guess he only steps up on the playmaking when he is the main option. For some reason he can't do it as a 6th man/with the bench at all - or even as a secondary ball-handler - he just forces way too many shots.     If CJ comes close to his hot stretch at the beginning of the season this could be a really good trade for both teams.  I really thought he would be a real #2 option this year but seems like injuries derailed it.
He needs a someone that can actually run the offense. Jrue Holiday isnt that. And that should have been apparent cause he played with Anthony Davis who needs the same thing
Because Jrue Holiday is a fringe star.
"Damn Bucks traded for Jrue Holiday, just for BKN to trade for Harden a month later and whoop them without him. That's heartbreaking for Milwuakee"
Jrue on a Holiday
Jrue going to holiday in Cancun.
"jrue ""best perimeter defender in the nba"" holiday getting cooked by everyone"
"&gt; I mean Jrue Holiday is a great player, but he's not someone who runs an offensive full time as a point guard.  Agreed 100%.  I really like Jrue but I felt towards the end of the season he was being overhyped.  Unless he completely changed who he was in the last year, he's never been that type of player."
"Yeah, but a lot of that is bad Bucks offense. Giannis and Middleton are just way too eager to attack one and one and put up bad shots. The Bucks seriously need calm down a bit and run more actual plays. This is why I questioned the Jrue trade. I mean Jrue Holiday is a great player, but he's not someone who runs an offensive full time as a point guard. I thought maybe with the way he wracked up assist vs the Heat he would was gonna prove me wrong"
Tell me more about how jrue holiday and pj tucker are game changers this szn lmaoooo
"I think it is a lot more players than people think.  Look at some of the players on here [for example](https://www.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/30482938/ranking-best-nba-players-2020-21-50-11). I think there are over 20 players that can be the best player on the team and still win it all if the rest of the team is really good as well. If you have a team like Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert for example I think that team can win it all."
Only question is why are the Bucks settling so much? They have the best rim runner in Giannis. Jrue Holiday is an elite passer and cutter.   Their offense is contested 3s/2s instead of ball movement and running.   Bud should’ve been gone 2 years ago
Jrue holiday needs more help
Jrue Holiday can't win with these cats
Jrue Holiday deserves better
"Well, he was. Spin it however you want, but the man was integral against LAST YEAR’S Bucks. I don’t think you quite get just how much different this year’s Bucks team is. The additions of Jrue, Portis, and Forbes were huge. We relied on him quite a bit last year, and it got us a Finals appearance, so I don’t think you can say that relying on Jae was problematic.  Exposed what? That they got a lot better? It’s not like both teams ran it back as it is. The fact that they added borderline All Star Jrue Holiday, along with great role pieces like Forbes and Porties made this an entirely different series since the teams weren’t exactly the same as last year. We got destroyed by a much different, and evidently better team, not an indication of last year’s run at all."
Jrue Holiday the only one who gives a shit
Hopefully the holiday the Bucks will be going on in a few days is better than Jrue.   It’s going to be hilarious when Bud is coaching them next year.
Jrue Holiday seems like the only one from the Bucks Big Three who came to play
jrue holiday is just so solid. him and mike conley seem similar to me. can’t really think of any other point guards who fit that ‘type’ idk
Jrue holiday is the best player on the nets
"Damn, a D Mitch/Jrue Holiday backcourt would've been nice to pair with Zion and Ingram."
"It's crazy cuz they keep talking about each team as if nothing changed. Lakers are playing with an injured AD and Lebron was in recovery mode still. Heat played a much differnet team in the Bucks with the addition of Jrue Holiday, a HUGE upgrade over bledsoe. Plus Jimmy looked gassed playing this much coming off a championship run with short off-season time.   The internet is good for many things, but I hate it when it enables stupid shit like this to take the spotlight."
"I can't believe this guy got paid more than Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bradley Beal, Jrue Holiday, Julius Randle, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown this season."
"I think Grant Williams has improved SO much. He shoots well now and defends with confidence. He will be even better when his reputation grows a bit and he stops getting the Theis treatment from the zebras lol.  I don't have anyone in particular in mind tbh. We need a PG who can just carry the scoring load on the 2nd unit. Jrue Holiday or Lou Williams or whomever. And we need someone who can stand in the corner and knock down an open shot (Korver from 5 years ago or so).  If we can turn the three trade exceptions we have, Kemba, and 2-3 role players into someone like that then I think we have a chance. As presently constituted, not happening."
His value is what the Pelicans got back for Jrue Holiday
"It's the Jrue Holiday situation. You don't let him go unless it's a suitable offer, to a championship contender, and to a team he's okay with going to. Lowry is the leading Raptor in franchise history."
"Let’s see.   Giannis has no footwork, for one.  Giannis can’t guard the best players.  Giannis can be the primary rim protector.  Jrue Holiday is a downgrade from any other option out there."
"The best way to judge how good players are defensively is to look at their ability to stay in front of their man and regain ground on a shot if they are beaten. The leagues best defenders get beaten, but the best way to judge a defensive possession is individually watching the matchups, the ability to contest without contact, foul at the right time and create turnovers are all accurate measures of a great defender. Some of my favourite defenders to watch are Jrue Holiday, Jae Crowder, Bam Adebayo &amp; Kawhi Leonard, they all defend differently, but they are the best defenders in the league if you ask me."
Man please .. Jrue Holiday will cook any of their guards..
"So what you're saying is you think Jrue Holiday was the difference in the Pelicans series and with him, the 45 win Pels were going to beat a 67 win Warriors team? Patrick Beverley (who didn't make an All Defense team that year and shot a whopping 38% from the floor) was the difference between a sweep and a Rockets win?"
"Out of 1000 playoff games minutes, the 2015 Warriors faced 260 with an opposing starting point guard and most of those were playing severely injured. If all-defensive Pat Bev was available or Jrue Holiday wasn't that injured, the 2015 Warriors wouldn't have had such a cakewalk to the finals. And then their finals opponent was missing 2 all-stars."
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind. RJ Barrett comes in 3rd.* ***Thibs intensifies***  Booker (1884), Beal (1811), Mitchell (1771), LaVine (1867), Tatum (1959), Butler (1490)  *I hope Mitchell does not miss the rest of the season, but as of today, he's played nearly as many minutes as the other players vying for a spot on the all-NBA teams. Currently listed as week-to-week.*  Best unmentioned players by RAPTOR: Clint Capela, Mike Conley, FVV, Jrue Holiday, Jamal Murray, Draymond Green, Jakob Poeltl, Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, and Thaddeus Young. Anthony Davis (800) and Kevin Durant (812) played too few minutes, but have been effective in their limited time."
4. Jordan Hill  5. Jrue Holiday  6. DeMar Derozan
I heard the jrue holiday trade reduced his role on the team and the money they were paying him so his team leaked his way out of it
Jrue holiday isnt a good ballhandler?
I have no doubt in my mind that they would be in the playoffs if Jrue Holiday had stayed on the team.
"I still can't believe we told Hutchison (some loser from basketball powerhouse Boise State) that we would take him before the draft....and then still took him in the draft instead of someone like Aaron Holiday, who had clear NBA pedigree with Jrue and Justin already in the league.  And I know 2016 was a shit draft but we took Denzel 14th 😂"
"Yeah he tripping with Middleton.  But Matisse, Smart and Holiday are versatile guard defenders, who can defend wings. Ask AG himself, Jrue absolutely locked him up."

"Damian lillard has basically been swept in 3 of the last 4 years in the first round. Except last year he did manage to get one game against the lakers. And jrue holiday for most of his time on the Pelicans was definitely not better than cj has been for the Trail Blazers. Anyone saying AD just straight up doesn’t know basketball. Damian lillard is seriously one of the absolute worst defenders in the nba. Just look up his 5 year rapm for the past 5 years. Meanwhile AD is easily a top 10 defensive player. Dame is better offensively, but AD is still really good on offense.   Damian lillard is clearly the odd man out here and the only other even possible one to debate is Luka doncic."
"https://youtu.be/-CzZZ-ohpFQ  Here’s a list of a bunch of elite NBA players talking about how good Jrue holiday is especially on the offensive end. Add PG, LeBron, PJ Tucker &amp; Kelly Oubre to that list too.  However, people said Bogdan &amp; Malcolm Brogdon are better than him."
"Take a look at this and tell me you can argue it? Alright?   [Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Chris Paul &amp; NBA All-Stars on Jrue Holiday | Best Defender In The NBA](https://youtu.be/-CzZZ-ohpFQ)  Let me know when all these players have said how good Bogi is and that he’s there toughest matchup.  Add Paul George &amp; Kelly Oubre to that list too, who weren’t featured in that specific video but had said so anyways."
"When did Bogi become a ""great player"" conductive to winning? He wasnt even starting for you guys and still wouldnt be starting if hunter and reddish dont get injured. If that great player logic works are the bucks better if you replace Holiday with a guy like Westbrook whos a better player? Or if you replace Schroeder on the lakers with Westbrook? Do those teams get better?  Averaging the same numbers and having less of an impact is what im stating and team success is very evident youre missing out on the fact Donte is a much better defender and wont take shots away from better players (Giannis, Jrue, Middleton) like Bogdan would. Im not denying Bogdan is a better player but he wouldnt be giving the bucks anything remotely close to those numbers OP listed and isnt a better fit that Donte."
"Hey nephew, Steph probably gets hand checked the most in the league and the refs let the defenders get away with it.  Jrue holiday who's known as the best perimeter defender in the league by so many stars literally said he tries every trick in the book when guarding curry"
Because all 3 of your examples aren’t mismatches at all especially ben simmons and jrue holiday who would have to be almost the best options in the league to guard said players
"He finished 9th and won a total of 7 points. In that sense Robert Covington, Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown were in the conversation for DPOTY because they all finished with a similar amount of points. His own teammate finished 3 spots higher than him."
I’m not saying the Celtics should do a jrue holiday deal and give merely a good player a big trade package but if a disgruntled star becomes available I think the Celtics should try to go for them without giving up brown or tatum(maybe give up 5 picks and smart or something for Beal or towns).
"Seeing your nametag, I gotta share this fun fact: At the beginning of this season, in fantasy basketball, I traded my Jrue Holiday + Jamal Murray + 2nd rnd Draft Pick for Russ. Safe to say that the other fella is probably regretting this heavily as right now I have won 13 weeks in a row lol."
"For me it used to be Jrue Holiday. Hes got his credit now but people used to think I was crazy talking about his potential and value on his old contracts. Like, even after his all star year. I feel like if you look beyond a box score it was pretty obvious"
This is what Jrue Holiday was talking about. Steph has somehow become a player that hoopers (professional or not) think they can replicate in shot taking/shot making. Steph is a 1 of 1 player.
Billups= Jrue Holiday RIP= Demar Derozan Prince= Kyle Anderson Rasheed = Paul Milsap Wallace =  Rudy Gobert?
"it's a pretty unique team and some players are hard to compare, but maybe  Cassell = Conley  Hamilton = Jrue Holiday  Prince = Thybulle  Sheed = sort of stumped, maybe JJJ?  Wallace = Gobert"
"What? AD took the Pelicans to the playoffs in 2018, swept the Blazers and won as many games as LeBron James did against the KD Warriors.  It isn't AD's fault that Jrue Holiday couldn't stay healthy for more than one season and that Boogie seemed cursed with injuries the moment he left Sacramento. The amount of shit that Lakers/LeBrons stans give AD is absolutely astounding."
"fr that jrue holiday was on point. ""he makes everyone think they should attempt those shots"" and then this shit is the result"
The fear is that no one in the West had a Jrue Holiday
reminds me of that jrue holiday quote about kids shooting random 3s bc they watch too much curry highlights lmao
No it started when Jrue Holiday was traded
Milwaukee would have to get the 1 seed in the whole league for voters to even think about giving him another MVP especially now that he has added a Jrue Holiday to his team

Jrue Holiday was just saying the same thing, he fouls him and won’t get it called. This is the way people guard steph, it’s the game plan Bron used during the finals run, RJ and Channing Frye talked about that."

It was covered widely.  https://www.instagram.com/p/CCraD1jhcPR/?utm_source=ig_embed https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/nba-star-jrue-holiday-donates-remaining-2020-salary-71842207 https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2923215-jrue-lauren-holiday-giving-rest-of-2020-salary-to-black-businesses-nonprofits

"&gt; These people have a brand and public perception to uphold. They have pr teams and sponsorships. You have to be incredibly naive to think you're getting the real them in an ESPN interview.  Then why did Steph tell them about the time he was thinking of proposing to his wife? Unless he lied about that as well using your logic.  &gt; Yes you need to personally know people in order to know what their friendship dynamic is like. What kind of question is that lmao  No, you're twisting what I said. I said whether they are friends or not, not the dynamics of their friendship. Dude, why are you being so dense. This is not brain surgery. JJ Redick just called Jrue Holiday ""an old friend"" as he welcomed him on his podcast. Was he lying about that as well? Using your logic, we cannot determine any sort of relationship with anyone unless they are married or related.

Tony Allen?  Present day I’d say Jrue Holiday
I just wanna ball with my brothers Jrue Holiday
"Jrue Holiday is my favourite player and the only one I'd consider shipping a real jersey over if it wasn't so damn expensive  Maybe one day, but for now I hope he gets a chip! Hopefully I'll catch it live"
"Any sane person would rather have Simmons, AD, or Kawhi defending any player in the league before they’d prefer Jrue Holiday. Saying Holiday is a top 3 defender in the league is patently ridiculous on its face and you’re right to point this out. Nephews are gonna nephew I guess."
A very Jrue Holiday-esque thing to do. Good on him.
I remember reading a pretty good article by Lauren Holiday earlier   https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/lauren-jrue-holiday-nba-racial-injustice
"I think your argument that I'm on a corner by myself saying Simmons is a better defender is almost as insane as saying Jrue Holiday is a top 3 defender in the league.   Do you honestly think he's better than Giannis, Embiid, and Gobert?   People are acting like I'm talking shit or something."
Simmons was first-team all defense last year and the only person that had more first place votes was Giannis.   Jrue Holiday is not a top 3 defender in the league any more than he's a top 3 MVP candidate.  That's an insane thing to argue.
Absolutely nobody is saying Jrue Holiday is a top 3 defender in the league.  Even if you think he's elite that's crazy.
"Jrue Holiday? Great guy, never met him."

Jrue Holiday and Gobert are considerably better than Randle though
"Guys who are still making more than Randle after this extension:  DeAngelo Russel, Kevin Love, Porzingis, Andrew Wiggins, John Wall, Jrue Holiday, Rudy Gobert"
Yea…with super teams. Jordan and Kobe would’ve won with Anthony Davis too. Let me know when Bron wins with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton as his teammates and he has to drop 50 in Game 7.
He barely attempts a shot and just passes. I want to see him take more shots than Jrue Holiday because we all know Lillard is the 2nd best offensive player on the team.
Jrue holiday deserves so much credit man.
"Nahh, Jrue Holiday put the clamps on him and had his number."

Jrue Holiday gonna make it tough for Patty.
Lol I don’t even live in Utah. And yeah if you actually watched you’d see the Lakers have had a great defense under Vogel whether Davis is on the court or not. He’s a very good defender but he doesn’t change the game like the elite defensive players do. Even with Jrue Holiday in New Orleans they never had a good defense.
"I mean, Russ' contract isn't worth much. He got traded for fair value - KCP, Kuzma and Harrell are neutral value assets at worst - probably slightly negative to teams that are actually looking to contend.   Jrue Holiday fetched three firsts, to contrast what the asking price of a good value star is."
"Is that your only response because you can’t name one player that was legitimately good on brons first stint cavs? I’ll wait for you to answer, but one doesn’t exist.  Who was better than Jrue holiday and kris Middleton on his first stint?  And I’m 30 years old, stfu you dumb high school/college student. I gave you two options because those were the only that apply. More options is not automatically a good thing."
"30 is easy.  Steph Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Doncic, Kyrie, Trae Young, DeAaron Fox, Collin Sexton, Jamal Murray, Brogdon, Wall, Walker, Ja, DLo, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Paul, Simmons, Conley, Lonzo, LaMelo, Dejounte Murray, Dragic, Rose, Smart, Haliburton, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Dinwiddie, Herro, Payne, Monte Morris. And Cade Cunningham, obviously.  I'd also take Rondo, Coby White, Clarkson, Teague, Campozzo and probably Maxey over Schroder."
"When he got drafted, I said Jrue Holiday would be his ceiling."
"Jrue holiday is not better than Beal,Westbrook and Brown"
"This is correct. Lonzo was basically 6’6 Steve Nash with Jrue Holiday defense, and we lost him for nothing.   I can’t believe we gave the Bulls a future all star 🤦"
You have to be fair here. Jrue is elite elite almost in a league by himself. There's nobody that's really as good a perimeter defender as Holiday.
Lonzo's on ball defence is very overrated. Can't fight through screens and continually gets burnt by fast drivers. He is great at getting into passing lanes and picking off passes. But Jrue Holiday he is not
"But you're ignoring what I said.........and I guess you're gonna keep ignoring it, too.....it doesn't matter to New Orleans whether Giannis wanted to leave or not. They successfully got large value for a guy that wasn't gonna do them any good anymore. Regardless of the circumstances on the other side it was a complete success for them. It was a robbery, because they did, in fact, got huge value in return for Jrue Holiday, regardless of why Milwaukee wanted him."
"Honestly, even the Bucks couldn't cover his lack of defense.  Jrue Holiday had by far the biggest on/off swings in the playoffs for the Bucks, even bigger than Giannis, cause the Bucks got outscored comfortably in the postseason with Forbes or Teague on the court.  The Bucks really only gave him postseason minutes out of desperation to rest Jrue a little bit and cause Teague was just as bad.  He did outscore Jimmy Butler in the Heat series, so he'll always have that."
By scrabble value:  Jrue Holiday: 25  Khris Middleton: 25  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 28  Donte DiVincenzo: 31
"All-NBA defense? Amazing playmaking? I do not understand which Lonzo ball some of you watched. He’s good at throwing lobs/outlet passes in transition. He is a slight positive perimeter defender, much better off ball than on ball defender at that. He does not stay in front of his man like Jrue Holiday level defender, he gets cooked on ball pretty often.  I’ll save the energy, you all will come to the realization that we did soon enough. We were also optimistic about him when we first acquired him, he’s just not that guy."
"&gt;Lol  So no rebuttal at all?  Didn't think so.  Check the salaries of veterans who averaged 6+ assists last year.  The only two who made less than Schroder were TJ McConnell and Ricky Rubio.  And Rubio is one of the worst shooters in the league, and doesn't defend.  McConnell is a 7ppg player.  The rest of that 6+ assist club?  Westbrook, Paul, Draymond Green, Jokic, Lillard, Morant, Fox, Butler, DeRozen, Simmons, Sabonis, VanVleet, Jrue Holiday, Randle, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brogdon, and Curry."
Jrue holiday says no
Kinda reminds me a bit of Jrue Holiday just obviously smaller
Could I pay Jrue Holiday half my winnings to take it for me?
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
Stone got 1 whole first round pick more than what the Pelicans got for Jrue Holiday.  They sold Harden for peanuts
Yes. I’d rather watch KD than Jrue holiday
"Still not a great argument.   Do we devalue the efforts of jrue holiday because of nets, lakers, Clippers injuries?  How about the bubble ring? Tons of what ifs over there."
"To me, this is totally understandable from a Bucks perspective.  I honestly don't think PJ provides much value on the court.  He's a tremendous leader and puts in the effort, but what does he honestly contribute when on the court?  He's supposed to be a defensive stopper, but he did very little against Durant, Booker, or Paul.   He also adds next to nothing offensively, and teams can hide their own defensive liabilities on him and/or allow their star players to rest defensively.  The advanced analytics on him are absolutely terrible - even on the defensive side of the ball.  The rebounding, steal, and block rates are all poor as well.  I get that teams need a defensive stopper, but I honestly think Tucker is, at best, a slightly above average defender - and that might be too generous.  Jrue Holiday is the team's defensive stopper, and DiVincenzo, who missed the playoffs, is far better than Tucker on defense as well.  People act like Tucker is Bruce Bowen, but the advanced analytics don't show him as a plus defender at all.  Honestly, his best trait, for me, is that he understands his role and doesn't take shots away from more efficient players."
"Just said Primo was reach, similar to after draft people said same about Bam and D Booker just saying it was reach as all had him projected way later, but get your guy is saying during draft - I like what your saying about making Murray star of team he great player and deserves recognition for it (similar to Jrue Holiday) but looking at around 11th spot on paper / Projections   lakers - Warriors - Nuggets - Jazz - Suns - Mavs - Blazers - Grizzles - Pelicans - Clippers - Spurs - Kings - Wolves - rockets - Thunder"
"Yep. As a ball defender he's like Jrue Holiday with more footspeed, or Thybulle but stronger.  His outside shot ... needs work."
Thats not true. maybe if he was a defensive stopper like jrue holiday he'd get close to the max. but if he was just a decent defender its not like he would be getting close to the max.  Also his shooting numbers dont look amazing but teams do guard him on the three point line. he can get hot from 3. Teams at least respect his shooting.
They got pushed into it because of a [Jrue Holiday incentive from winning a title](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/07/22/championship-pushes-bucks-into-luxury-tax/) they had clearly planned on ducking it as always and just had to dip into it slightly this year because of something they themselves might not have seen coming(a title). And even now after always ducking it and losing out on guys like Brogdon they are barely skating into it while just blowing tens of millions on things like extra houses. People dont need to defend billionaires doing shit billionaires do just call it what it is.
I'm starting to sweat thinking about Jrue Holiday guarding Patty
Unlike Jrue Holiday where shooting and stealing is a natural inclination for his type.
"Bluntly, Devin Booker played his heart out in the NBA finals, lost, and then got on a plane to Tokyo.  Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday could have partied for a month in Milwaukee. They were on a plane to Tokyo as well.  Kevin Durant is the best basketballer on the planet (and, yeah, Im a bucks fan. Father time is undefeated, and the future belongs to Giannis. But right now ? Its KD). After a rough ECF loss where he left his heart on the court, he's there too.  So. They are all American athletes.  And as an Australian, I'm proud they are there. We will need to go through them for the gold medal, and there is no better way than to face the best."
I'm glad I get to say NBA Champion Jrue Holiday now
"Lmao jrue ""COME ON NOW"" Holiday"
Jrue Holiday!
so jrue holiday can double dribble but garuba cant pivot ?
Jrue Holiday is the best name in all of sports
They didn't assemble the best squad possible. No dominate big men just a bunch of scorers and Jrue Holiday for defense.
Jrue Holiday is an absolute monster on defense… he has been the difference this qtr … we start seeing lapses as soon as he goes off floor
Jrue Holiday playing some good defense on rubio
Jrue holiday came in and changed the tone of the game in the 2nd quarter with easy steals
Jrue Holiday is an impact player
rubio is mentally tougher than i cuz i would be crying if jrue holiday was picking me up full court the entire game
Jrue “Hustle Play” Holiday
"Dude, it sucks. The Knicks are the biggest market in the league, have literally every advantage that y'all don't, have been worse than y'all the last 20 years anyway, and still all these media dickheads do everything they can raid your squad.  I find this narrative that the Pels ""wasted"" Chris Paul and AD so fucking obnoxious and anti-historical. Chris Paul never made it any further in the playoffs in LA than he did in New Orleans, but no one ever talks about how they ""wasted"" him.   With AD, the Pels made aggressive moves to add Jrue Holiday and Cousins. Injury luck didn't break their way, and it sucks. The Bucks make an aggressive move to add Jrue Holiday, injury luck does break their way and I guess they're geniuses, and the Pelicans are trash, and Zion ""deserves better"". I'm so happy Giannis ignored all this BS and stayed loyal, and hopefully, he inspired guys like Zion to do the same."
Lakers are adding veteran shooters+Westbrook so I’d favor them. I don’t think Kyle Lowry moves MIA past Milwaukee. Jrue Holiday locked up CP3 &amp; Book he’d give Lowry the death penalty in a 7 game series. Giannis already took Jimmy’s lunch money and I haven’t even mentioned Ka$H money Middleton.
Cool - I guess he’s almost 3 times the defender Jrue Holiday and Lonzo is apparently 3 times the offensive player he is according to OPM. Please keep quoting stats with no context.
"As a long time pelicans fan, this is the most obvious move motivated by money I have witnessed. Being a kiwi, it was easier to deal with the Steven Adams deal. I respect the way Jrue holiday was looked after he definitely deserved the championship. But you toss away an amazing asset who has improved every year and give us Satoransky. Its hard to be a loyal fan to these small markets."
Giving up picks to create cap room to sign people and then having to give up more picks to actually sign people is an absolute disaster scenario for small market teams.   This is a big L in the macro picture of things.  Not to mention this is all to fill a void a point guard after having jrue holiday and lonzo on the roster this time last year
Maybe because it’s not even fucking close and the Morey ball is working. Ben is worth jrue holiday level value or less
Are you referring to NBA champion Jrue Holiday? Because if you are...lol
Giannis never got the opportunity to prove good loyalty either. He waited until the Bucks sold off their future to get Jrue before he signed. If the Bucks FO felt like he was the super loyal guy he's being pushed as now do you really think they're paying that much for Jrue Holiday?
"Yeah, doesn't this put him in the conversation with Kyle Lowry, Jrue Holiday, or... well, I guess he's probably better than KCP. Lakers didn't really have a third option, did they?"
He's a downgrade on Jrue Holiday.
"I think the big issue with the current team is that there are too many pure scorers and you can’t just pick the 12 best eligible players to make the team.  This would be my team. I think it’s a good mix of scoring, passing, size, defense and experience.  Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Zion Williamson, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Myles Turner"
They need someone like... Jrue Holiday
"In retrospect, the only trade of a first rounder Demps probably takes back is the Asik deal. He's not taking back the Jrue Holiday trade or the Boogie trade or the Mirotic trade."
"Just watching the replay now, and it's painful to see how the USA's lack of size is killing them. This team construction is kind of head-scratching.  Even so, if Team USA can improve its ball movement from people not named Jrue Holiday and get a lot of possessions pushing the ball in transition, they should cook everyone. The team needs to settle in and play as an actual team instead of a bunch of playground guys just showing up."
"Hot take: Jrue Holiday is a winning player who does great things on many fronts. On the other hand, I really don't like Tatum and Booker's game. Their shot selection is terrible, and they always look like they just want to hit Kobe shots instead of play within an offense and do the little things."
well now jrue holiday can say he was the scoring leader in a game where his teammates were durant and lillard among others
He cooked Jrue Holiday so many times that game. Was crazy to watch.
"It’s never a good sign when Jrue Holiday is out scoring the likes of KD and Dame. Even less so when he just got done celebrating getting his championship, got off a 20 hour flight, and has had practically 0 practice with the team."
So it's either all star or role player there's no in between? Siakam didn't make the all star team is he a role player? How about Jrue Holiday?
You need playmaking to control pace and generate good looks consistently. You don’t need elite playmaking to simply get the ball to your best players lmao. Jrue Holiday is a very good playmaker as is Draymond. Even when they have guys out there it doesn’t matter if Pop is trying to make them the 2014 Spurs in one week.
"With all due respect to JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, Jrue Holiday (who played well), and even my home team guy Jerami Grant, I wouldn't lose much sleep if I were presented with the opportunity to replace them with healthy versions of Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kawhi Leonard."
"Well 3 of them (Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Booker) just flew in from US the day prior after ending the NBA finals the previous Tuesday."
"Start Holiday and Book at the 1 and 2.  Jrue can definitely just be a distributor and defender and Book is really good overall off the ball.  After that still stick with KD, Tatum, and Bam.  Let Dray come off the bench and be the bench distributor with guys like Lavine and Dame."
For real. There are some guys who still play through fouls and don't beg. But for every Jrue Holiday you've got 5 guys who roll across the court like they've been shot if the wind in the gym changes while they're shooting
"come on bro, jrue holiday is a better playmaker than dame"
"Lol how's he dragging a team with that 4 for 12.  In fact, Jrue Holiday, off of a championship, is dragging his bum ass on offense and defense."
"yeah i mean you're comparing laimbeer to 3 of GOAT centers... hakeem olajuwon for example, even beyond his position, can be argued to be a top 5 player of all time. if bill laimbeer can make it as a starter in today's USA national team, then that says a lot about today's NBA. like you said, it especially speaks of the drought of US-big men in the NBA. their best big men are international players.  for sure a shortened offseason should be factored in, but the whole world faced complications against the pandemic. a lot of international players also play in the NBA, so it's an even handicap imo.  i watched the USA vs France game in 2019 (check it out if you haven't), and it seems like the common denominator is your last point.. most of them are ""superstars"" on their team and don't know how to really play team-ball as a consequence. their teams are structured in a way where the team revolves around them as a center piece. now all those players come together thinking they're the justice league, when really they're just confused on how to play together.  so yes, these players are individually athletically talented, more than previous generations. their talents, however, are capped- They lack the talent of being able to play on any team. Guys in previous Olympic teams knew how to play with each other, despite not being on the same team... and that talent is more important in team sports, like basketball. This isn't tennis.. sometimes basketball is like tennis, when you're playing 1-on-1. Too bad there isn't a 1-on-1 professional league watched by millions of viewers on television. These guys would excel at it.  the problem is, everyone wants to be ""jordan,"" yet even jordan wasn't the leading scorer of the dream team. he played his ROLE.. and they let charles barkley do most of the scoring because his body/strength/basketball ability was kryptonite for every other team. they all served their roles and no one tried to be a star, most of them never played with each other, but gel'd immediately. maybe it's just the culture that's in the states right now, everybody wants to be ""That guy,"" but the real ""that guy""s knew how to do it all, and that's what US kids aren't seeing. Even watching the Redeem Team.. man they were ferocious on the court and playing beautiful team ball. Kobe wasn't even the leading scorer, but again, like Jordan, he played his role.  &amp;#x200B;  i'm sure if the team consisted of Lebron/Steph/Klay/Durant/Draymond/Myles Turner/Dwight Howard/Brook Lopez/Jrue Holiday/Kawhi Leonard.. they'd be beating everybody. First, 4 of them have played together on the same team. Second, LeBron can fit on any team because his game is like Magic Johnson's, he just fits on any team. Dwight Howard is old but he's tough now, plays bully bull on his limited minutes, and he played on the Redeem Team like LeBron. Myles Turner and Brook Lopez are the only American-born Centers who are better than all the other American Centers who have been in it for 5+ years. Myles Turner is a liability because he would've gotten destroyed by Gobert (see footage of Pacers vs Jazz games). It's sad that team USA would have to have him as a Center because he's young/has more stamina than Brook and Dwight, but doesn't have an aggressive rebounding nature against REAL centers. Rotate minutes. Jrue Holiday knows how to play proper defence and is a team player. Klay is one of the NBA's elite defenders. Kawhi, elite defender. If you had Jrue, Klay, Kawhi, Draymond, and Dwight Howard all on the floor at the same time.. It's gonna be a loooooong day for all the opposing teams.  &amp;#x200B;  finally, no disrespect to popovich, but these lineups have been questionable (even the plays ran in the 2019 game). i don't know if he's the right coach for this team"
Yes they got the best Greek player and the best USA player Jrue Holiday
"I can’t speak on the first 2, but it’s an absolute fact that Dame is a loser.  Getting benched for Jrue fucking Holiday, then the whole country saying ‘what the fuck pop’ when Lillard comes back in with 2 minutes left and then watching him immediately turn the ball over and then get lost on defense while we give up a 3 is so on brand for Dame Time."
"When Jrue Holiday who didn't even shoot well is your leading scorer, there is a problem"
Yea bro a 6’3 guard is gonna stop jrue holiday attacking the rim witha running start.  Even if it doeshappen the chances of him making it are much higher than hitting a three.   I really dont see how this a debate either Rudy Gobert is at the 3 point line.  Drive.
"The world HAS improved and the NBA players don’t get the calls they used to. When you combine those two things, its tough.   On top of that, they are a thin team. I thought Jrue Holiday was our best player today. You know, the guy that got there YESTERDAY??  Also, the team sounds good when you say their names but when you watch em play- Tatum was shit today. Lillard wasnt good. Durant was in foul trouble and wasnt great.   That means youre depending on matchups like Zach LaVine vs Evan Fournier, which isnt THAT lopsided."
Fair I just think we need more Jrue Holiday type guys right now
"Im not comfortable paying jrue holiday 40 million a year, as i would kawhi,lebron,ad,giannis,kd,steph,tatum,luka,embiid,jokic,lillard, off the top of my head"
&gt;Is Jrue Holiday a top 10 player?  In this US team? Yes
"Kevin Wayne Durant Houston Jerami Grant Jrue Randall Holiday Edrice Femi Adebayo Draymond Jamal Green  But most interesting, France no. 30: Petr209 Cornelie"
"Jrue Holiday was the leading scorer on a team with Dame and KD. It's not selection that's the problem here, it's everyone else."
NBA All-Stars?   Devin Booker  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Zach LaVine  JaVale McGee  Jrue Holiday  Bam Adebayo  Khris Middleton  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Draymond Green  Keldon Johnson  There are no better players in USA than these? Only one I even know is Kevin Durant.
"The FIBA refs allow the defender some leeway.  French players were guarding KD, Booker and Lillard very close. In NBA, these players would have swiped side to side or tried to draw a shooting foul. But they can’t try that here.  Lavine got frustrated a couple of times and pushed off for offensive fouls. Need players that can post up and use their strength to get to the basket. Jrue holiday was the only one getting to the basket. But even he missed couple of point blank shots."
More like hungover and jetlagged Jrue Holiday. That's concerning af for Team USA.
That's on Jrue Holiday.  He allowed that rebound.  SAD.
"For real. Jrue Holiday, Booker, and Lavine are literally the only guys I saw drive. I don't think the US forwards know how to drive and take contact. They're so used to phishing for fouls and shooting free throws."
"You wanna talk about wasting draft picks? The Timberwolves (along with the Kings) are the true experts in this field that all the other teams bow down to  Selected Brandon Roy in 2006, good job. Immediately trades him to Portland for Randy Foye because reasons.  Drafts a Florida Gator in 2007, sound logic as Florida were back-to-back NCAA champions. But y'all took Corey Brewer and not future DPOY Joakim Noah  The Timberwolves drafts 3 point guards in 2009, none of them were named Steph Curry or even Jrue Holiday  They took forward Wesley Johnson over DeMarcus Cousins in 2010, if they didn't want a big man Gordon Hayward &amp; Paul George were also still available.  Another forward in Derrick Williams in 2011 despite drafting Johnson the previous year.   Acquires Shabazz Muhammad in 2013, a shooting guard that can't shoot or guard anyone. Out of the league in 4 years  Drafts 4-year college player Kris Dunn in 2016, he shits the bed in his rookie season despite being touted as ""NBA-ready"" and ended up being packaged in the Jimmy Butler deal (not that I'm complaining, he was decent for the Bulls)  Drafts Justin Patton in 2017 (John Collins was still on the board), dude gets injured in Summer League and has played a grand total of 296 minutes of NBA basketball since. Last seen on the Rockets"
Jrue “America’s First Option” Holiday
Jrue Holiday was team USA’s leading scorer
The team selling on Jrue Holiday.  He just wants to have one like his wife and yall throwing. Jeesus.
"Because our biggest stars can no longer be bothered to actually show up.  I really love Jrue Holiday and he did everything he could to bail out the team, but there is no way he should be the leading scorer on an NBA Olympic squad."
"Iso is a part of the game.  Absolute absurdity. Theyre over passing. Gregg Popovich ego is a part of this. Jrue Holiday making iso plays is the reason this USA team didnt get blown out against france. Amazing 2nd half performance.  They had open looks especially JT and just passes to Draymond or Lillard. This USA team is so out of balance no rhythm no nothing. If Gregg let these superstars do you like theyre great at, they are going to dominate always!  So much hot potatoes!  dream team had isos too! dont give me that ""oLd SchOoL baskETbAlL iS BeTtER"" yeah as if people will forget how they got beaten embarrassingly against a COLLEGE TEAM."

"First of all Does USA know that they can take layups and midrange too ? I understand that it's hard without the 3 s violation but they have to adapt. KD and Dame sold this game, Tatum just pass you don't have to take over here specially if the shots aren't falling. Bench have to be more agressive bar Holiday it looked like they just wanted to pass to KD or Lillard. Jrue and Draymond needs to be regular they were the best in this game. Fournier and Gobert were monsters.Also I know it's the fun thing now and maybe I am biased but are you all gonna blame pop for this ? he has flaws but damn did they choke. On the other hand I am not American and I supported France so not a bad day for me."

Gobert had a very good game. Bam or Draymond were just switching at the top of the key leaving Jrue Holiday to defend Gobert. Jrue still managed to do a good job.   Jrue was the only one trying to pass and trying to get to the rim. Others were just chucking contested jump shots. If not for Jrue this was a 15 point game.
My boi jrue carrying KD.   holiday &gt; Durantula  Fight me
Jrue Holiday made a layup to give him 12 in the quarter with 5:24 left. He didn’t shoot again until 23 seconds were left in the game.
When Jrue Holiday is your #1 scorer you know shits hit the fan.
No lie adding Jrue Holiday would take the USA to gold
Jrue Holiday was the only dude who showed any heart in the fourth quarter but even he wasn't enough to drag USA over the line.
Man. If jrue holiday is your leading field goal attempted player theres something wrong. He doesn't have giannis to bail him out in this team.
"ugly, terrible basketball. holiday was the only one playing with hustle. the US game plan is literally drive, kick out to three, drive, kick out to three, contested three, miss, no rebound, repeat.   GET IN THE PAINT. props to Jrue for getting to the rim, picking up his assignments full/half court. heart of a champion. bam did well first half too. everyone else is just camping the 3-point line"
in a team full of scorers (majority of them being ISO scorers) the guy with the most shot attempts is Jrue Holiday... you know you are done.
"Hungover Jrue Holiday after a 20 hour flight to Japan can not be team USA's best player.  Also this Roster construction fucking sucks, taking 6 high volume meme-chuckers as your wings is so stupid."
**JRUE HOLIDAY NEEDS MORE HELP**
It's tough to win a basketball game when you have KD but your top scorer is Jrue Holiday.
nando de colo and evan fournier outscored everybody but Jrue holiday.
"Jrue Holiday landed last night in Japan, hasn't trained since and played better than everyone else lmao"
Bruh jrue holiday really played well for nothing and he just came of a 6 game finals run
Commentator talking about shaking off the cob webs Jrue holiday won an nba title less than week ago
the only good things I've seen today are Bam Adebayo on the boards and Jrue Holiday taking it to the basket. Everything else Team USA is doing has been straight up trash
Jrue not taking any holiday. What a stud!
Jrue holiday
NBA CHAMPION JRUE HOLIDAY
"I’m not trying to be dramatic, but if anything ever happened to Jrue Holiday, I would kill everyone around me and then myself"
Zach Lavine and Dame standing around while Jrue Holiday cuts up the D. Bizarre but acceptable
Jrue Holiday is making STATEMENT the last few weeks. One of the leagues best guards.
Jrue Holiday. That is all.
That’s the nba champion jrue holiday for ya
Jrue Holiday baby!!!
NBA Champ Jrue Holiday tyvm
American Hero Jrue Holiday.
Jrue holiday is saving team USA right now
Pray for the Iran point guard next game. Jrue Holiday is gonna clamp that poor dude up haha
NBA champ Jrue Holiday showing how it's done
Jrue Holiday is the Dream Team by himself.
2 words: Jrue Holiday
Olympics MVP JRUE HOLIDAY
Jrue Holiday is single handedly carrying the team in the 4th quarter!
Jrue Holiday
Bro Jrue holiday has literally changed this game. Incredible how valuable he is
is jrue holiday the greatest international player of all time?
"Jrue Holiday carrying USA right now, seems like the only one of them hustling right now"
"jrue ""no holiday"" holiday"
Imagine Jrue Holiday missing three fuckin layups in this game and trying to somehow use his performance to say he’s better than Tatum lmao
Imagine watching this as your first basketball game and wondering why Jrue Holiday is considered a worse player than Tatum afterwards
Who knew Jrue Holiday fresh out of the Finals will be the best player for Team USA
"Jrue Holiday is so clutch. I never want to see him, Giannis, or Bobby Portis again. They give me nightmares."
"This USA team needs a true playmaker, Draymond could be that but he cant score and Jrue Holiday aint it rn."
"“Jrue holiday is an all around player, not known for any one thing but does a little bit of everything”  Uh...his defense?!? He’s known for his defense LOL"
Jrue Holiday out here looking like a whole ass football player lol
Jrue “Adebayo” Holiday
Jrue Holiday’s wife is named Lauren Holiday
"Jrue Holiday man, dude comes right over to Japan after winning a championship and ends up being a glue guy for this USA team"
Jrue Nutmeg Holiday
NBA champion jrue holiday
jrue holiday steal and pass to booker  feels surreal after the finals lol
World Champions Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday and Marcus Smart come to mind
Jrue Holiday for the Pels.  An amazing person and so glad he got his ring with the Bucks
Glad to live in a world where jrue holiday is an nba champion.
Jrue Holiday is much better than Eric Bledsoe
"Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan have been all stars more recently than Jrue Holiday, so by that logic KD had two all stars as well. Jeff Green had a better game than any game Jrue had in that series. Middleton wasn't even an all star this year either. Imagine talking about Giannis 'needing' anything in comparison to the dude that's only won after joining a 73-9 team lmao stop it"
Everyone with eyes picked out Jrue Holiday and Tony Allen  That's not exactly spotting talent early in someone's career
"If you gave Lebron players of Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez's caliber during his first stint in Cleveland he never would have had to leave to win one. His best teammates his first go around were Zyndrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams."
I like living in a world where Jrue Holiday is a champion.
I like living in a world where Jrue Holiday is a champion.
I like living in a world where Jrue Holiday is a champion.
I like living in a world where Jrue Holiday is a champion.
"Jrue ""the last piece"" Holiday"
"Jrue ""the last piece"" Holiday"
"Big market team have a high chance of winning a championship, because they can attract FAs or disgruntle player to get in trade. Bucks got a generational talent in Giannis, Khris Middleton who can be 2nd best player, big gamble with Jrue Holiday trade, and the Super Team on Nets got injured. The Bucks took advantage of the situation to win their chip, and nobody can deny Giannis, Middleton, and Jrue their chip. Can you believe it Mike Budenholzer is a championship coach now?"
We Sixers fans celebrating NBA champion Jrue Holiday
I think they gave that Jrue Holiday turnover to him too.
As a Pels fan I am overjoyed seeing NBA Champion Jrue Holiday 🥲❤️🥲❤️🥲❤️🥲
"Who did they attract? They went out and traded for Jrue, if that's who you're talking about.  https://www.nba.com/news/pelicans-acquire-steven-adams-eric-bledsoe-in-4-team-trade-jrue-holiday-to-milwaukee"
"The attempts is the important part here, not how many go in. 19 Jrue Holiday shots is 19 shots Giannis wasn’t taking, doesn’t matter if he goes 4-19 or 14-19."
"I mean, this was Giannis in 6.   Everyone else got a ride on that bus.   Congratulations to Jrue Holiday for shooting 4/20 and 4/19 in two separate games in the NBA Finals."
he's also given props to Jrue Holiday for the longest time
I love payton..his to physical kinda like pat bev prolly wouldnt do as great on defense as he was in that area not being able to touch these guys and there skills and range makes it tough he would b like a jrue holiday player a bit better. Still would b the best defensive guard though.
"And nets were a jrue holiday shooting 46% away from losing in 6 games, so who cares about what if"
People can say how location doesn’t mean much. But it sure as hell makes it harder. They had to naturally develop Giannis and Middleton to be the players they are today to having to trade for Jrue Holiday with a ton of assets.  It’s a lot different when you had LeBron signing with the Lakers and AD forcing his way to there. Or something like KD/Kyrie coming to the Nets and Harden forcing his way there.
"Or because Booker cooked Jrue, just like KD and Trae did before. But Holiday found his next gear, especially defensively, the last couple of games and redeemed himself."
"To be fair, during a lot of the series Milwaukee put Jrue Holiday on Chris Paul because they feared his combination of passing and scoring more than they feared Devin Booker’s scoring."
"Yo, wait, Devin Booker has to fly on a private flight to Tokyo on Friday with just Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton. He is squarely in hell"
"Jrue Holiday again proved himself an indispensable part of the team with a near triple double, despite a poor shooting night. Devin Booker had a regrettable evening especially beyond the arc. Giannis was clearly hungry for this win! What a win!"
"Dirk got a ring as a lone star against the then defending champs kobe-gasol-odom lakers, the  harden+westerbrook+kd thunder, and the miami trio.   Giannis winning it this season is imo the closest thing to Dirk in 2011 in terms of a star getting a championship that isnt tarnished by all the superteam bs, but he has a much better supporting cast in middleton and jrue holiday (although the rest of the crew is arguably worse than the 2011 mavs supporting cast)  That said, you guys dont have mark Cuban, do Giannis and the bucks aint done yet so he could very likely surpass dirk in title count, off-seasons wins, scoring etc that just didnt happen post-2011 for dirk because of meddling ownershit."
But you *can* win a ring with Jrue Holiday as your PG.     Logic checks out.
The Jrue Holiday addition just sealed their fate
"Seeing Bud, Giannis, PJ Tucker, Portis, Jrue Holiday, and Middleton all win their first ring is pretty sweet."
"bucks fans randomly start chanting ""Bobby"" while Jrue Holiday being interviewed? Strange."
I guess the lesson is to trade for a Pelicans player in order to win the championship (last year was AD and this year was Jrue Holiday)
Bucks would’ve won in 4 without Jrue Holiday
I can’t believe they’re booing Jrue Holiday.
"Giannis performance aside, Jrue Holiday was 1 rebound from the tripe double, the man put up 12/9/11"
Jrue Holiday deserves his ring stripped and given to LeBron
Not that easy with Jrue Holiday draped across you woo
And put some respect on Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton
Giannis goes out last year at the will of the heat and is helped with Jrue holiday the next season   Bron brings the Cavs to the finals and is helped with fat shaq.   No hate to both let’s just appreciate one of the best performances in basketball
Jesus Christ Jrue Holiday really is Glue Holiday
"Oh, he dragged Khris middleton and Jrue holiday to a chip. Get real"
Jrue Holiday FMVP
JRUE HOLIDAY IS AN NBA CHAMPION
I'm happy that Giannis showed that you can win in this league thru player development and loyalty but I am FULL FUCKING MAST for a Jrue Holiday ring!
Jrue holiday was the best offseason trade to happen this year
"Nba champion pj tucker, nba champion brook lopez, nba champion jrue holiday, nba champion khris middleton and nba champion giannis antetokounmpo"
jrue holiday really was the missing piece
Jrue Holiday is a missed shot from his 2nd legendary 4-20 win...
a Middleton Dagger hands a ring to Jrue Holiday. What a time to be alive.
Jrue Holiday is one rebound away from probably the worst shooting performance for a triple double in playoff history but fuck it  Man has 4 steals and is a minute away from a ring
"Honestly, I'd breakdown the problems for the Suns as:  Jrue Holiday making CP3 and Booker's life hell  Ayton being neutralized by the Lopez/Portis/Giannis 3 headed monster  Khris Middleton greening every jumpshot down the stretch  Giannis being the Greek God of basketball"
President Biden should use his emergency powers to prevent Jrue Holiday from taking another shot in the game
"Jrue Holiday triple double watch, would be the 14th player to get one in a finals game"
Why does Jrue Holiday always come through in clutch time
Bobby portis is the third part of the big 3. Jrue Holiday is a role player but his role is to win outright every 4th game auto.
Jrue Holiday is legit the lowest IQ player on the floor.
The rollercoaster Jrue holiday experience is on full effect tonight
Jrue Holiday is clueless
"Jrue Holiday: 3-16  Pat Connaughton:  0-3, +/- of -22  Jeff Teague: actually saw the floor, +/- of - 5 in under 2 minutes played  but talk to me about the refs some more."
HERE COMES JRUE HOLIDAY
Jrue Holiday is a fucking dumbass
I think Booker is gonna have nightmares about Jrue Holiday after this series
"Jrue Holiday is definitely doing other things, but he's had a lot of really low percentage games. Can the Bucks offense not push more of those shots into other players? Middleton has half the shots Holiday does despite being a better weapon."
Jrue Holiday has been known to make a questionable decision or two on occasion
Giannis gaining a jumpshot to smite Jrue Holiday
Holy shit Jrue Holiday. A decent game from him and the Bucks probably lock up their title.
Not having Holiday by Madonna cued up for big Jrue plays is a missed opportunity imo
"someone remake the ""Dame is Westbrook's Dad"" meme but it's Jrue and Book. Holiday is rent free inside that high fade noggin"
"Jrue ""Kawhi on defense but Pat Bev on offense"" Holiday"
Jrue Holiday wife is a snowbunny:)
Jrue holiday!
Jrue on Holiday with his shooting tonight
"Jrue Holiday is allergic to the basket tonight, but he's playing good defense."
Jrue Holiday really needs to work on layups
Jrue “Ben Simmons” Holiday
Jrue holiday man how the fuck does a star professional basketball player randomly go this BROKE?
The Jrue Holiday showed up today
Jrue Holiday is now 1-12  Might be time to have someone else shoot.
Jrue Holiday gonna have me deleting some old comments
its mostly Jrue Holiday
"I’m not being fooled by Jrue Holiday again, he’s gonna make all the clutch shots to secure the dub for the Bucks."
"Jrue holiday has games of 4-14, 7-21,4-20, and now 1-11 and counting. That's really bad"
If Jrue Holiday wasn’t having a shit half itd be a tie game. Bucks have 10 TOs. Impossible to have the lead playing that sloppy
Jrue Holiday going 1-11.  Don’t care how good you are on defense that shit gotta be better
Jrue Holiday gets his powers taken by the monstars on a game to game basis.
How good is jrue holiday for suns
Jrue Holiday has 2 more points than Jeff Teague.
catching delta to watch jrue holiday shoot 1-11 LMAO
"""That was the worst point guard, in a Championship Finals, I’ve ever seen. He was too wild. He was taking off-balance shots. You have to come out and set the tone with Giannis Antetokounmpo … Jrue Holiday has gotta set the tone with Giannis."""
Why are the refs making Jrue Holiday shoot 1-11??? Smh my head Adam Silver
Jrue Holiday 1/11   Fuhhhhhh
Somebody tell Jrue Holiday it’s a game 6
Jrue holiday FG% is the same as M. Nights % chance of making a movie that isnt complete dogshit
It’s all mental with CP3 blowing by Jrue holiday in open court when he’s passing up wide open floaters like he did earlier it’s not the defense it’s just mental with him and the torn ligament in his hand. If he gets over the mental block though the opportunities will be there with how they are defending him he frankly missed 3 very open looks as is still in the first half
1/11 jrue holiday is how they keep up
Jrue Holiday lmfao
Jrue Holiday has been hot garbage wow
Yeah because this would be the first game where jrue holiday plays like a g leaguer for an entire game lmao.
What the fuck is wrong with Jrue Holiday? He's been awful
Jrue Holiday is so ass on offense.
"They would be stupid not to Kyries miles better offensively and they have Jrue Holiday to cover up his defensive lapses, granted the Bucks if offered may not due to Giannis being rly close with Jrue, but from a basketball perspective it would be the logical move"
"you put jrue holiday infront of not only chris paul, but also ben simmons"
"the smart thing for that team to do would’ve been to build around Jrue holiday, evan turner, and spencer hawes. This has been reddit nba analysis"
"Absolutely wouldn’t have won IMO. Think about the average possession of booker or paul vs jrue, compared to booker or paul vs literally any of khris, pj, pat, or teague. Booker especially was getting his way with anyone not named Jrue Holiday (or giannis i guess but he wouldn’t be primary defender). He had a huge impact on defense, and there are many plays you can point to to prove it (most notably the game 5 steal-&gt;alley oop)."
"Which ones?  * Jrue Holiday trade would have been a good trade if Giannis didn’t re-sign and Bledsoe played like his value at the time  * AD trade was one of the biggest hauls of all time and netted better assets than the Kawhi trade (similar situation in which the superstar did not want to play fo the team)  * Extending Adams was not a great decision but is by far not the worst decision since Adams is playing solidly contrary to what most people think. Plus, he’s a traceable asset with his current salary  * Trading Hunter for Hayes and NAW isn’t really consequential since Hunter is injured, and NAW and Hayes have developed well, especially for their draft position  * JJ Redick trade was necessary. Redick wasn’t good enough for a trade to his desired location and the FO would be even more ridiculed for making such a bad trade. Letting him go off waivers after paying $26m to him is also a bad idea."
"Idk if Jrue Holiday is a supporting character, dude is legitimately a star. They traded four picks for him"
The Nets getting James Harden for the cost of Jrue Holiday is why the Bucks title means more
"I still think it’s the KD shot in Game 7 to force OT. Given how depleted the Nets were, the importance of the game, and the difficultly, it’s an all timer.   I know everyone is gonna say the Jrue-Giannis oop. Really tough to argue against that. BUT…it was probably the wrong basketball play. Holiday should have dribbled it out and got fouled. Bucks were really, really lucky Giannis was able to make that play and even luckier that the FT bricked so hard they got the Oreb. It was such a cool moment. I just can’t put it No. 1  1. KD shot 2. Giannis oop 3. Valley oop"
If you consider the laker stacked then the bucks were stacked lmao. You forgot jrue holiday the best defensive PG in the league who can still give you 7+ ast and 15+ pts. Who did the lakers have a third guy making their team stacked? KCP? 😂😂😂😂
"Well the Lakers did set the market for every desperate contended trading for a superstar after, look at the Paul George and Jrue Holiday trades later. Same sort of thing happening."
"2021 Bucks in 6. This form of the bucks has much better defense, coaching, and most importantly experience. The raptors only won because Giannis was shook and became a liability, the moment was too much for the young bucks. 2021 Giannis has shown he can’t be stopped. Jrue Holiday is a huge upgrade from Bledsoe, and Middleton has found comfort in his role. Giannis would outscore and rebound Kawhi every game."
"I don't know why people downvoted you for this, it's really something people should look at and be aware of. AD has this reputation for always being injured, but people need to look back on those Pelicans teams and realize that *everyone* on them was hurt all the time, year after year (just look at [this Pelicans fan's comment about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oooaw2/within_2_years_of_being_traded_from_the_pelicans/h605rl0) elsewhere in this thread). AD's injury absences are well documented, but people need to look at how many games guys like Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, Jrue Holiday, Omer Asik, Quincy Pondexter, Austin Rivers, etc were missing.   Maybe it was just a lot of bad luck, but considering the fact that they were the only team in the league that did not have their own training or medical staff, that probably played a part. They were using people who specialized in football players to look after their basketball team. And that's fine if it works, but if it doesn't then I think it's perfectly fine to question why they did that or to call them cheap for doing so."
Yeah NBA legends and game breakers Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton 🙄🙄
"It truly is. Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo make a decade of my salary every game. I’m not hating. It’s just truly astonishing. We’re all shitting on Ben Simmons, meanwhile he just bought a $17 million house. It would take me 8 lifetimes of salary just to pay the principal for that lol. Jrue Holiday just got a $1 million bonus for winning the championship, it’ll take me 15 years to make that. Wheretf does all the money come from? Like I understand there is “TV money” but where is that originating? All from advertisements?"
"Get this:  Holiday, Middleton, and Booker will all be on the private flight to Tokyo together.  Could be an awkward flight!   From Yahoo news:  USA Basketball will have a private plane ready for not just Booker, but two of his Finals opponents — the Bucks' Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton — who will, no doubt, be in far better moods."
"He’s casting stones from glass houses imo. The second they gave up 5 first rounders for Jrue Holiday, they made the exact same move the nets made for James Harden. But apparently that’s only trying to form a super team for one of them."
"You have phrased this in a really passive aggressive way.  Anyhow, AD isn't as good as Giannis. AD's a top tier #2, but he's not a #1. Also the Pelicans never got the injury luck for the opponents that the Bucks got. Brooklyn was this year's GSW and they were severely injured. In our best year, in that GSW series we were the ones missing an all star to injury.  The Bucks have a more complete roster than the Pels ever did, for sure. But Cousins in his prime and Jrue Holiday are comparable to Khris Middleton and...Jrue Holiday for core 3."
"I’m not saying the bucks are easy, I’m saying that the bucks were an inch away from losing to the Kevin Durant and harden on one leg. Jrue holiday shot 4-20 and 4-19 in 2 games that they won. If the suns somehow make it to the finals again, they aren’t going to get a better chance than they had this year"
Pelicans GM Dell Demps got flamed for trading out of the draft (and the next) to acquire a young all star by the name of Jrue Holiday.
"He said he did it the hard way ,which is facts until the playoffs started cause that was kinda easy playoff run compared to others . My point is ,don’t call out super teams when it’s really only one left and kd basically almost beat you alone . Without a jrue holiday or kris"
No but I guess I thought too highly of jrue Holiday. I thought he was all start quality point guard but with a league of great point guards he never got his due. Them trade three first round picks and signing a max contract sounds like a high quality player to me.
Jrue Holiday is a very good player but he's been a fringe all-star at best in his career. Cavs acquiring Kevin Love was acquiring an all-NBA caliber player at the time.
Agree. The fact that they won 2 games with jrue holiday shooting 4-20 and 4-19 just kinda shows this ring was not as hard other rings to get.
"He probably did it to try setting an example for his team. Chris Paul gave zero congratz and was a little cry baby bitch crying on his way to the locker room. Should be interesting seeing Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton play on the same team during the Olympics."
"I mean games 3-5 Holiday guarded CP3 primarily. CP3 had uncharacteristic turnovers those games. Game 6, Jrue is on Booker now. Booker plays poorly, and CP3 has an efficient game. Seems like Jrue was a big part of it."
"1) Giannis Antetokounmpo   2 )Khris Middleton   3) Jrue Holiday   4) PJ Tucker   5)Brooke Lopez   Oh sorry, that's just the starters for the 2021 NBA CHAMPION MILWAUKEE BUCKS"
"It hurts as a Suns fan because games 4 and 5 were very winnable, but you are right.  Bucks matched up well, and the physical style of play favored them.  Giannis won the finals MVP - but I actually think Jrue Holiday was the Bucks' most valuable player this series. Whoever he was guarding was completely taken out of the game. He disrupted the Suns offense completely."
"Was his team really built in a different way than other “super teams” though?  Signed Brook Lopez in FA  Traded 5 firsts for Jrue Holiday  Traded a first for PJ Tucker  Signed Bobby Portis in FA  Signed Pat Connaughton in FA   Particularly the Holiday trade, like that’s exactly what building a super team looks like, even if Holiday isn’t necessarily at the same level as other stars who normally get a haul like that"
"Nah. Jrue Holiday put you guys in the luxury tax, thus screwing you out of a KD signing."
The dude comparing Fat Deron Williams to Jrue Holiday asking others to be real.   The irony is thicc in here.
"Haha I rewatched that yesterday!!! We got so new knights of course like sir Bobby of Portis, sir PJ of A lot of Shoes Tucker and sir Jrue of Holiday but we did it! Sir Mirotic knew that sir Bobby was coming and left in a haste!"
"Khris dropped 40 once this postseason run. He also had 9 games with &lt;20 points. He's a fantastic player and that shouldn't be a detriment to Giannis's legacy. Additionally, those 2 have been on the same team for 8 years now, adding Jrue Holiday doesn't compare to the other moves teams have made to win and no one thought MIL were title favourites coming into the season. Your opinion is your opinion but if you can't appreciate what these guys accomplished I feel bad for you. It was truly impressive (and this is coming from someone who tried to discredit Giannis whenever possible, I was an idiot and I was wrong)."
they needed jrue holiday as a co #2 though
Jrue Holiday asks if they have the 4 for 19 combo meal
"Its also a strong message to FOs to not get complacent with their core. The Bucks had a strong team in the previous few years, but they made a winning move this season when they added Jrue Holiday and later PJ Tucker."
maybe a few Jrue Holiday jersey sales too
Here are a few takes that Trillie has had this morning;  - Winning a title for the team that drafted you isn’t an accomplishment   - Giannis took HGH and that’s why he grew  - 2021 Bucks were a super team  - Jrue Holiday is an All-Star  - These playoffs deserve an asterisk beside them  - the Bucks success was a fluke and everyone knows it  Definitely one of the more insightful members of this subreddit /s
"Jrue Holiday hasn’t made an All-Star game in 8 years… Dirk, Tony Parker, Roy Hibbert, Bosh, Millsap, Kobe, Pau Gasol, and Tim Duncan have all made the All-Star team more recently than Holiday."
Yeah because 36 year old PJ tucker and 6’3 Jrue Holiday is going to stop KD.
"There’s a difference between having Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh as your other 2 guys, or Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson as your 2 guys (3 with draymond even) than…. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton. How are you gonna say that good team building is a “super team”?"
To be fair there wasn’t even anyone of Kris Middleton or Jrue Holiday status on the Lakers team before AD came in.
"Lmfao a year ago it was the Bucks couldnt build a roster for shit.   Trading for Jrue Holiday is all it takes? He’s a good player, but not Earth shattering"
Being Jrue Holiday right now must be so awesome
"Lmao you dumb as hell dawg  Every team they played missed their starting PG except for the Cavs that had kyrie for game 1 until he broke his kneecap in over time   First round they played Pelicans without their starting PG, jrue holiday  Second the played Memphis without their starting PG, mike Conley, also missing tony Allen  Third they played Houston without their starting PG, pat bev  And in the finals they played cavs without their starting PG, kyrie, from game two and forward. And Kevin love also out  Damn I bet you feel dumb   It wasn’t even that long ago…wtf"
When I got roasted in my friend group last year for thinking that the Bucks were right to make the Jrue Holiday trade  Feels nice
"This comedian was talking about how he took his girlfriend to a basketball game, and she mishear someone shouting ""Fucking Jrue Holiday"", and thought he was saying ""Fucking Jew Holiday"" and was really surprised at the anti-semitism"
"Mans is trying to act like he didn't have a strong team completely built around him and that Middleton is just some scrub. Middleton was dropping 40+ points multiple times throughout this postseason. Name a ""regular"" team with a secondary player capable of doing that? Name a ""regular"" team who finesses a player like Jrue Holiday, who's already an all-defensive talent, and would definitely have multiple all-star appearances if he started in the East. This narrative that the Bucks did it the right way is stupid because it blatantly ignores nuance. I guess the real definition of a ""super team"" is a team where multiple all-star level **popular** players form a team together."
Let's give Jrue Holiday and Middleton credit for their defense tonight. Middleton never gets credit for his solid defense. Jrue made chris Paul and Booker look very guardable.

Both teams were a combined 1/13 from 3 in the fourth and Jrue Holiday hit the 1 with like 10 minutes to go
"If it's a team built through draft Then why did they trade all those picks for holiday?..... Look I'm happy for him but this he didn't join a super team to win the ring is a bullshit argument...... He has had Eric Bledsoe,  Malcom Brigdon, Khris Middleton now Jrue Holiday...these are all good players in their own right..... I do not like the comparisons though coz Lebron had no one of this Caliber on the Cavs team when he left for Miami.... and he was facing Boston celtics with 4 HOF and Giannis has been shut down completely in post season which Did not happen to KD and Lebron.....I get that he played well but he did not go through Nets at full strength.....I completely hate this false argument that bucks did it in some real way....the Bucks have moved so many pieces to cover up Giannis weakness"
I will not let this Jrue Holiday slander slide either. His shots weren’t falling but dude was locking up Book and CP3 on the other end. He had triple double with 4 steals.
Larry Hughes was kind of Jrue Holiday player of that day. And Big Z and Brook flip a coin.
Bucks a team of real ones. JRUE HOLIDAY I SEE YOU THAT’S A REAL MUTHAFUCKER
"&gt; Jrue was a guy averaging 18/7 on 49% TS on a bad team. He was pretty good, but not a star. A team built around him was never winning a CHAMPIONSHIP which is the ultimate goal here.  But Nerlens Noel is? Even if he lived up the potential, he was never destined to be a franchise changing player. I don't think anyone would argue Jrue Holiday is going to be the best player on a championship team, but he is a very important piece and the point is they didn't have to trade him. They traded him because he made them too good. If a 22 year old makes you too good, you don't trade them.  &gt;And what good is a winning culture for one season if you tear it down the next?   Playoff experience. Players are playing meaningful games. It shows the team isn't just trying throwing these guys out there to lose games.  &gt;Is Shai happy that instead of fighting in the playoffs his team is pissing around in the lottery for the foreseeable future? And just traded their starting caliber center for a washed PG who probably won’t even play for them?   You're saying Kemba is washing but Horford is caliber center? Or Moses Brown? Because Moses Brown doesn't win you any games right now. Kemba makes them better now. I don't know if they hold onto him and Kemba certainly isn't the same player he was, but he makes the Thunder a better team now.   &gt;Other than 2001 the Sixers for the last 30 years either hung around the lottery or limped into the 8th seed just to get smacked by the Pistons or Lebron  But that's the problem. Lots of teams are destined for the forever the 8th seed but they get out of by getting better and making smart moves. In the past decade, Indiana, Toronto, Golden State, Utah, Denver, Miami, Milwaukee, Portland and others have had more or similar success than Philadelphia without becoming awful.   Did it work for Hinkie? Yeah, in a way it has because now they are a contending team. But if Embiid doesn't his foot and gets picked by Cleveland, where does that leave Philly? All the other teams built their teams outside the top picks. If Hinkie is this mastermind like everyone claims he is, he wouldn't have had to throw away 4 seasons to turn the team into a contender."
"Jrue was a 22 year old star. Chris Paul was 34. I have zero doubts Hinkie would have shipped Paul before the deadline for a fraction of what OKC ended up getting for him because they decided competing and building a winning culture was more valuable to the young guys they had. Gallo was essentially a free agent who was also 31. Schroder is somewhat fair, but he was also older than the guys Philly traded and the return was quite a bit higher.   &gt;The Jrue trade worked out great for us too idk what you’re talking about. It let us tank for Embiid and also got us the pick for Saric  The Jrue trade led to 4 straight losing seasons included 3 of the worst seasons in the history of the franchise. You know they have to show for those 4 awful seasons? Some second appearances and it looks like another one is happening this year. How many teams were able to at least make multiple second round appearances without doing what Hinkie did? A good GM would have found a way to build around Holiday. Hinkie just complained the game was rigged and stopped trying to play so he could luck himself into first overall picks."
"All those picks and no impact players isn't nearly a Godfather offer for a superstar imo, a bunch of mediocre and protected picks.    Anthony Day-to-Davis is the lower bound for a superstar imo, if he even deserves that title. AD got back three young, cheap starting quality players, one with clear all-star upside in Ingram, three more FRPs and two swaps, despite having one year left on contract, massive injury concerns and his near-assured move to LA in a few months.  That package is miles ahead of the picks the Thunder have and it's hard to imagine a less enticing superstar than AD that summer.  Jrue Holiday is not even a star and got 3 unprotected firsts and two more swaps along with two useful players.  To your point those lakers picks weren't worth a ton because AD and Lebron were going to be there.  Trading other team's picks for a superstar is always more enticing to the star's incumbent team because the returning picks won't stink.  But you usually need a lot to get a star player and picks often won't do it.  It's hard to make a case to your team owner that the GM should keep his job despite your 25-57 record because you have some protected picks coming down the line."
Jrue Holiday played just about perfect defense on KD and it didn’t stop him from sinking shot after shot. Not even sure why he tries to get open when he can swish everything with a guy sitting on his face.
"&gt;OKC isn’t shipping off any big pieces   So tearing down a playoff team and trading CP3, Schroeder, and Gallo isn’t a big deal, but trading Jrue Holiday and Thad Young is? Lol.   The Jrue trade worked out great for us too idk what you’re talking about. It let us tank for Embiid and also got us the pick for Saric."
"There's a few differences.  One is the length, throwing away a season is recoverable, throwing away 4/5 is borderline mockery of the game.   Two is OKC's 2019-2020 season. They could have moved Paul and Gallo but they didn't like the return and competed and made a fun playoff run. OKC is showing they are willing to do what's best for the team, not just trying to get the best pick.   Third, OKC isn't shipping off any big pieces. Philly made some good moves under Hinkie, but trading a 22 year old Jrue Holiday was awful at the time and even worse in hindsight. They gave up a 25 year old Thad Young for a late first rounder that did nothing for them. Heck even Evan Turner had more value than what they got for him. The issue is Philly was trading anyone that would make them win, even if they were 25 and younger. Sure shipping off a 30 year old for a prospect or a late first rounder, but giving up players for basically nothing because you don't want to win games is an awful way to run a team.  Fourth, OKC an off-season away from being a competitive team. Philly needed 4 years to recover from their plan. OKC can flip some of those picks for players to go along with the talent they have and be in the playoff race within a couple weeks. OKC has a plan to be good. Philly didn't, Hinkie was holding out for a lottery victory, Presti is taking control over his plan."
Can’t leave jrue holiday open like they were with Bledsoe
"Dominant game from both of them. If Jrue Holiday can step up more of the offensive end in game 7, Nets gotta be alert. Bucks can still absolutely win this series."
"Joe Harris shows up, the Nets win. Jrue Holiday doesn’t take 10 stepback 3s, the Bucks win."
Man imagine if the wolves took Steph and Jrue Holiday with those picks
The power of Jrue Holiday. ;)
"I’ve watched jrue holiday do like 5 step back 3s with nobody even near him, what the hell is he even doing lmao? Ima love when KD buss y’all ass in fame 7"
Jrue Holiday swims in cocoa butter you heard it here first
Im not going to understand how strong Jrue Holiday is until the announcers tell me about his strength about 13 more times
Jrue Holiday 1/10 from 3? Why is he even attempting 10?
Would anyone be surprised if a news story broke about jrue holiday being involved in a gambling scandal? It's almost the only reason I can think to explain his fucking brutal 1/10 from 3
Jrue “Worse Than Giannis From 3” Holiday
Not going to draw too many fouls taking easy midrange jumpers over Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday itching to go on a holiday? Dude is shooting like trash
"Jrue ""Not Bledsoe"" Holiday"
INSANITY = DOING SAME THING OVER AND OVER EXPECTING DIFF RESULTS = JRUE HOLIDAY
"Jrue ""Giannis"" Holiday from the 3pt line"
The Nets second best player is Jrue Holiday.
i don’t wanna see jrue holiday with the ball in his hands
"Everyone always says Jrue Holiday is the most underrated player in the NBA, but that is absolutely undoubtedly Kris Middleton. He’s such a quiet beast."
Middleton playing his soul out to bail out Jrue Holiday
The “Jrue Holiday is so underrated” crowd is so quiet that I can hear myself breathing
Jrue holiday is the Milwaukee buck that should get the most slander. He's embarrassed himself constantly. Not even an upgrade from Bledsoe at this point
Jrue Holiday is really shitting the bed. This game is only close because he is taking terrible shots
Fred pulls the mask off Jrue Holiday to reveal: Eric Bledsoe!
Jrue Holiday doing his absolute best Eric Bledsoe impression tonight
Jrue Holiday makes like at least 3 dumb ass plays every game
Jrue Holiday is not a championship type of player. Such low IQ
"Lmao choke time, courtesy Jrue Holiday"
"Fuck superteams man, the Nets have Jrue Holiday too now???"
"for such a smart guy, jrue holiday is such a low iq player"
Only if they put a shock collar on Jrue Holiday and fire it up every time he takes a 3. Hit it twice when he shoots a step back 3 for no reason whatsoever. Oh look he just bricked another one.
Jrue holiday heard the media say he has to score more and decided to take extra step back 3s. I don't think that's what they meant lol
Bucks thought they signed jrue holiday instead they got jrue Bledsoe
I know we like shitting on Giannis but Jrue Holiday is the real offense killer. He goes ISO damn near every time he touches the ball in the second half
The elite 6’3 defender jrue holiday trying to defend Kevin Durant.
Jrue Holiday with some of the worst tunnel vision I have seen. He needs to facilitate the ball more
Can any bucks fan explain to me why jrue holiday is randomly doing step back 3s when no one is even on him LMAO
Jrue Holiday 1-8 from three ? Christ help us
So disappointed in Jrue Holiday this series
Jrue Bledsoe just chucking step back 3s  put Jrue Holiday back out the dude who attacks the rim
"I had Jrue Holiday for fantasy and he was amazing all year, but wow he looks so bad in the playoffs"
Bud will let 6’3” Jrue Holiday guard KD before Giannis
Jrue holiday step back 3 against a hobbled James Harden 🔥🔥🔥
"Wtf happened to jrue holiday, he definitely wasn't such a ball stopper in new orleans"
Jrue Holiday worst player in the league? I say yes
Is Jrue holiday a discount bledsoe?
If Bucks are going for isolation plays could at least not  be by Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday getting paid 30million to average 14/6/4 in this series
Man that jrue holiday trade has looked brutal this series lmfao
Jrue holiday got a case of the Julius randles
Why is Jrue Holiday shooting iso stepback threes from the corner? This Bucks offence is so stupid man lmao
Jrue Holiday gotta be one of the dumbest PG in the league.
Jrue holiday is decent in the playoffs but you can tell he’s never been past the 2nd round
Jrue holiday a bum lmao
It’s painfully obvious that Jrue Holiday needs to play alongside another point guard
"There is absolutely no chance the Bucks are winning anything... their 3pt defense is horrid, they help one pass away all the time... and plus, they brought in Holiday who is a definition of an on ball PG and they are not letting him handle the ball... Giannis is not a PG, decision maker or a ball handler (unless in transition) and fucking Bud is failing to make one fucking adjustment. Let Jrue be the player he is and let Kris help him and leave fucking Giannis off the fucking ball in half court, he is useless... post him up with miss matches and let him run when he can, everything else is pure bullshit... he would absolutely get his numbers anyway but the other guys are useless when he is dominating the ball so wtf wtf wtf. They have the team but they don't have the coach and that's why I'm so pissed off. I'm not even a Bucks fan but it's painful to watch them play the same shit for five years and still failing miserably, obviously. Bud deserves all the shit he is receiving he is useless"
"Kevin Durant is 0-1 vs Jrue Holiday  ""JRue HolIDAy owns KD"" on Twitter for the next hour. Should be awful."
If Giannis was wise and didn't sign the extension the Jrue Holiday trade could have gone down as one of the worst deals in NBA history!
"It's so infuriating. That Jrue Holiday 3 pointer is a bad decision, just go into the paint, they can't stop it. How they haven't learned this two minutes into game 1, I can't understand."
Jrue Holiday trade looking good
Where is Jrue Holiday?
Jrue holiday ain't jaylen Brown stop it
"Jrue Holiday has always been one of the most overrated players in the NBA. People never watched Pelicans games, but he was never a good half court point guard. The fact that he barely averaged 8 assists with AD on his team is a massive indictment on his skill. Bron's first year with AD, he led the league in assists."
"so unless it's a foregone conclusion that because giannis cant shoot, we will forever never win a ring, the coaching staff needs a plan to circumvent the fact that giannis is being gameplanned against for not having a reliable outside shot.   and the gameplan that I've seen has been completely nonsensical, such as jrue holiday ISOing KD for long twos and brook lopez not posting up joe harris. so either we skip 4 years of giannis supermax and trade him for not being able to shoot, or we try an easier method of getting a new coach in who might use the tools we have differently"
"I’ll take the two time MVP, Jrue Holiday, and 2 time all star Khris Middleton over Tatum and Brown. You’re delusional if you think anyone would take the Celtics job if the bucks become open."
"Lets assume they fail this year.  Then they don't do it next year...Jrue Holiday aint getting any younger. Neither is Khris Middleton.  Giannis will be 28 and at a crossroads, and his next two best players will be 31 and 33 and probably fading fast."
"According to NBA voters, Eric Bledsoe was a better defender than Jrue Holiday the last two years. This year, they swap teams, and what do you know? Jrue is firsy team and Bled is nowhere in sight"
"Wants to make the Playoffs and win now, proceeds to trade Jrue Holiday away.."
Jrue holiday couldn’t create his way out of a paper bag if he plays like he does against the nets
TIL getting five first rounders for Jrue Holiday is terrible. Will get equity in Bucks next time.
Jrue Holiday over here winning sportsmanship awards lol  https://www.nba.com/news/jrue-holiday-wins-2020-21-nba-sportsmanship-award
"Wonder if they could somehow make a Jrue Holiday, Bledsoe swap.  Maybe throw in some picks or something.  Jrue seems like a perfect fit around Zion."
"To a certain degree yes, but being an undersized defensive liability point guard is not that big of a deal in the modern NBA.   There are very few lockdown defender point guards, and only a handful that have respectable offensive output on top of that, really it's like Jrue Holiday and Chris Paul and that's it lmao. In the modern context of the NBA, having a high octane offensive point guard makes more sense than a defensive specialist."
"People seem to forget. When AD was on that franchise they had Jrue Holiday for about 2 years and Boogie for half a season then he tore his Achilles. Other than that, there were moments AD was starting with players like Omer Asik, E'tuan Moore &amp; Solomon Hill. But because this sub hates the Lakers they'll act like AD was playing next to a superstar there for his 7 season there."
"Well they needed to match salaries for the Jrue Holiday trade to work, that's why we took Bledsoe."
The NBAs been rigging games. This is nothing new. The refs get the message to give certain stars leeway and they do. Hence with Durant. All it took me was one vid of Jrue Holiday getting called a foul on Durant and the refs guilt ridden face to know
"Guys were in and out of the line up so you can't just look at the win loss totals, the Bucks have been a really good team the past few year and put all their chips on the table getting Jrue Holiday to become legitimate title contenders  They are not a bad team but the sure as hell are underperforming"
The amount of draft picks it would take for me to even consider trading dame… remember how many jrue holiday got? Yeah I gotta Atleast double that minimum.
This Bucks team can't hit a FT and Jrue Holiday started this game 3-17. Divincenzo is hurt. LeBron would've washed this squad.
Jrue holiday is better than joe Harris.
I think if CP3 is healthy I trust in the Suns  However I am a bit happy that my take that the Bucks were right to trade for Jrue Holiday might get proven right
Its Jrue Holiday. No one cares enough
"If the bucks lost, Jrue Holiday slander would be at an all time high"
"I wish, it was funny when he kept calling Jrue Holiday as Khris Middleton 😂"
Jrue Holiday was building a brick mansion for the first 45 mins of this game and kept his confidence.
If the bucks lost middleton and jrue holiday it'd be the same
Jrue Holiday was shooting like shit all series too
"Jrue messed up by throwing the inbound pass to Lopez instead of an open Giannis. Bucks won inspite of his terrible offensive game. Dude was jacking up shots like he’s prime Michael Jordan.   Played solid defense, give him that, but Giannis could have scored 60 tonight without Holiday missing 18 shots. I felt bad for him as he kept thinking he’s the guy."
"What a series!!! That was AMAZING!!!  Watched every game - the choke jobs, the blowouts, the historic performances. This had so many ups and downs and ended in a way I would have never expected.  Takeaways -   * People are gonna clown KD but come on. Dude gave everything. Just couldn't finish, playing all 53 will make that happen. * Harden had so many open shots that he could have made. What was going on!! * The Big 3's future is uncertain. It's one of the best ever assembled, but with no chemistry, and way too much load management and PTO days, it's hard to have faith.  * Giannis!! Really stepped up in the 2nd half. Made his jumpers, kicked out open looks, and was a monster in the paint. Justified his two MVPs.  * Jrue Holiday stepped up HUGE in the fourth, and eventually so did Middleton. Kinda. Giannis NEEDED that. Those two were the difference - Nets role players just didn't show up. * Fuck the refs.  This was a phenomenal ending. But even though I was rooting for the Bucks, I feel REALLY bad for KD. That airball broke my heart.  Looking forward to the CONFERENCE FINALS. We're already there! Nobody would have predicted these conference Finals at the start of the season, even the playoffs.   Best wishes, Brooklyn."
"Jrue Holiday played as bad as possible, until the fourth"
"Jrue Holiday played as bad as possible, until the fourth"
now do khris middleton and jrue holiday
Please stop. Harden with zero explosiveness is not better than Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton
Jrue holiday narrowly escaped an entire summer of Eric bledsoe memes
That's a win for small market teams right there. Lets goo bucks. Jrue holiday was ass all game but hitting those 2 clutch buckets at the end of regulation was all worth it.
“We only had 2 superstars instead of 3! That’s why we lost to Jrue Holiday!!!”
Jrue Holiday
"Giannis won playing against the nets, the refs and Jrue Holiday lmao"
"I don't know, *maybe* not trying to hit a turnaround fade away three while down 2 being absolutely smothered by Jrue Holiday, lol."
"At like 3 minutes left, Jrue Holiday got a bullshit call in his favor, making it like 1 to 50. The Bucks beat the Refs and the Nets. If you want to know how this game went look at all of the fouls on Harden, or the call against Tucker to get him ejected, where he was literally hugged from behind. Fuck the refs, fuck the Nets, fuck superteams, fuck floppers.   Fucking Nets flopped 100 times in this series, show me more than one Bucks flop?"
Game was close because of jrue holiday eating shit
"This is officially a Jrue Holiday slander zone. I don't ever want to see ""Jrue Holiday is better than \_\_\_\_\_\_"" ever again. I don't care if they won, that was soooo absurd."
"Kevin Porter Jr dropped 50 on Jrue Holiday, but Kevin Durant could only manage 48? Scrub."
"Won playing against the nets, the refs and Jrue holiday. Legend in the making"
"This is finally the game that differentiated the Bucks of last year from this year with the addition of Jrue Holiday and PJ Tucker and a more reliable Middleton.   Holiday was absolutely crucial on the final possessions in regulation creating his own shot, and easier offense for Giannis, Tucker was the pivotal piece that was able to defend Durant down the stretch and force a turnover that helped keep the Bucks in the game and Middleton showed his confidence in late in overtime to hit the big shot that became the game winner.   Budenholzer's career lives to see another day."
Jrue Holiday was awful
Jrue Holiday had a godawful start (3/19) but made several key buckets late in regulation that were the reason Milwaukee was even in overtime. Credit to him too. Along with Khris Middleton.  Plus that might have been the best defensive play of the playoffs. To force Kevin Durant into that shot is incredible defense.
"Jrue Holiday is better than Kevin Durant, I saw it live."
"Jrue Holiday played like Eric Bledsoe in the first 3 quarters  And then like Terance ""The Fucking"" Mann in the 4th"
GIANNIS  VS   THE NETS  KD  JRUE HOLIDAY  KHRIS MIDDLETON  THE REFS
"Not sure who was less accurate, Jrue Holiday or Marv Albert"
Jrue holiday pays out for the bucks
"This is officially a Jrue Holiday slander zone. I don't ever want to see ""Jrue Holiday is better than \_\_\_\_\_\_"" ever again. I don't care if they won, that was soooo absurd."
Jrue fucking holiday
Something about Jrue Holiday having his moment
Fucking Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday has been so ass
Kris Middleton 5-23  Jrue Holiday 8-24
"Harden is a pussy ass bitch, Kevin Durant is the softest basketball player in the history of the sport, Bruce brown is a bum who is riding coattails of 3 all stars just to be irrelevant again in 2 seasons, &amp; Jrue holiday sucks at basketball"
Jrue holiday is terrible.
Why is Jrue Holiday taking over the game!   Giannis hasn't touched it in 6 minutes.   Jrue should be ran out of town.  And these Nets bandwagoners lol
JRUE HOLIDAY HOW ARE YOU SO FUCKING BAD
"Jrue ""max contact"" holiday"
Jrue Holiday and Middleton are such low feel players.  Those two cost the Bucks what would ultimately be a trip to the finals.  Game is over folks.
WHY THE FUCK is Jrue holiday still shooting??
remidner the jrue holiday is 5-21 and decided to take it at blake griffin for... reasons.   no basketball iq on this team.
Giannis is the most anti-clutch superstar I've ever seen Jrue Holiday made all the big shots down the stretch
Jrue Holiday took over 5 seconds to inbound that. Theyre super lucky they didnt hand the Nets a chamce
Why did jrue holiday try to waste the clock? Dumbass
"Bucks coulda put it away, then Holiday and Jrue decided to give the game away   Game is over. 0% chance the Nets lose in OT.  No chance."
Jrue Holiday disaster class
Jrue holiday is doing his best to keep the spirit of Eric bledsoe alive
last shot of the game you give to Jrue Holiday?
Game 7 in the playoffs really decided by Khris Middleton vs Bruce Brown and Jrue Holiday vs Blake Griffin
FUCK THE LEAGUE. COME ON WISCONSIN YOU DONT NEED THEM. JRUE HOLIDAY WILL KILL NEW YORK AND THE OFFICIALS WITH HIS VARE HANDS. BULLSHIT CALL BUT WHATEVER
"That would stop the ""Jrue Holiday bad"" posts for a few minutes."
Jrue Holiday trick y’all man.
I waver between unwavering confidence and crippling self hate just like Jrue Holiday wavers between a bucket and a fucking black hole.
"Jrue Holiday gets a foul called. Marv Albert and Grant Hill ""He slipped!"""
Jrue Holiday telling yall to calm tf down!
"Jrue ""never misses more than 18 in a row"" Holiday"
"All hail Jrue Holiday, our Lord and saviour!"
Jrue came back from his holiday
 JRUE HOLIDAY IS MURDERING BROOKLYN WITH HIS BARE HANDS AND I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES
"San Fernando Valley,  Jrue Holiday!!!!"
Jrue Holiday no longer has the worst game 7 performance. John Starks is safe.

"Jrue Holiday was our dream pickup, just in case you needed validation."
You know who's rigging this game? Jrue Holiday by shooting 3-19.
Jrue Holiday is stealing from it
Refs have not been good but neither has the efficiency of Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton lmao
Don’t know who’s worse this game the refs or Jrue holiday
Refs fucking the Bucks almost as much as Jrue Holiday damn
JRue Holiday really decided he was going to have a John Starks game 7. 3-18 LOL.
Did grant hill call that WIDE OPEN jrue holiday 3 pointer a tough shot? Lol
Jrue is back from Holiday
Because it was Jrue Holiday
Can't wait to read Jrue Holiday trade ideas in new posts tonight  edit: nvm
JRUE HISTORICALLY BLACK HOLIDAY
oh shit jrue holiday hit a shot?!
"Jrue ""John Starks"" Holiday"
"Giannis haters:   *Looks at Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton's stats*  *Looks at Giannis stats*  ""Lmao, he didn't even score 50? And he can't shoot very well?? wHaT a ChOkEr"" Not realizing that they have a huge bump on their heads from when their mothers dropped them when they were a child."
Jrue “Dennis Schroder” holiday
Remember when people were acting like Jrue Holiday was the missing piece in the Bucks championship run? Pepperidge farms remembers Jesus Christ lmao 😂
Jrue holiday got a supermax lmao
Jrue Holiday somehow outdoing Eric Bledsoe must be some kind of sick joke by the Basketball Gods
Jrue Holiday is a fucking disaster
"Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton lost this game, legit feel bad for Giannis"
Wasnt Jrue Holiday on his teams?
"Offensively, they are pretty equal.   Defensively is where the difference comes in to play. Luka is average whilst Trae is really bad.   However, in today’s NBA, having a guard who is terrible on defense can be hidden as long as the other team doesn’t have 5 live-ball threats who can do something with the ball, and none of the teams the Hawks have faced have had that, all of the Knicks/Sixers/Bucks have had players who Trae can hide on like PJ Tucker or Danny Green.   Furthermore, Hawks haven’t faced a great offensive guard yet who can hunt mismatches. The closest they’ve faced is Jrue Holiday, who is a solid offensive player but not a star that breaks defenses. If the Hawks make the Finals, they are in for a rude awakening against the damage that CP3 and Book would do to their defense which isn’t that great, but is getting masked by opponents who aren’t great offensively."

"How many role players have to miss open three point shots in crucial moments in the playoffs for people to understand that these aren't the right plays, ESPECIALLY when it's a 3-PT shot.  There's a reason Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton get paid 86 million a year combined and Pat Connaughton gets paid 4 million, Connaughton isn't a great shooter and a 3 there is a mistake anyways.  Every time this situation comes up i always say this: If you are LeBron James or Giannis or whomever it is, you are giving the defense a favor when you pass to a role player in a crucial moment, that's EXACTLY what they want and that's why Kyle Korver or Danny Green or, in this case Pat Connaughton, is wide open. Part of what makes a great player a GREAT player is being reliable in clutch moments, that's not the same for a role player.  And before people ask ""But what about Jordan passing to Kerr?"", That was a two pointer right around the foul line, my opinion completely changes if its a layup or a WIDE OPEN 12 footer."
“He can’t beat Jrue Holiday one on one”  Proceeds to beat Jrue Holiday one on one
"I can’t imagine how salty you have to be to watch that shot go in a couple minutes after Harden banked a three to take the lead, see him airball the exact same shot a few minutes later, and go “Idk it was only a two and Jrue Holiday hit a nice mid ranger after sucking for three quarters so the Bucks clearly have luck on their side tonight.”"
Jrue Holiday was playing drop coverage?
"kenny is right that it’s asking a lot of jrue, but shaq has a point that trae is going to make them look bad regardless of how they play it. trae is outplaying the scheme you think you can play because you have holiday on ball."
Seriously Jrue Holiday got absolutely cooked on this play.   Had to walk it off like he just ran a lap in middle school gym class.
"(2018) Damian Lillard in 4 games against Jrue Holiday: 74 points, 19 assists, 25/71 shooting (swept 🧹🧹😹)  (2021) Trae Young in 1 game against Jrue Holiday: 48 points, 11 assists, 17/34 shooting (won)  🧐"
He worked Jrue Holiday in particular wtf
Jrue. Holiday actually locked Trae down for one of the regular season Bucks games around the middle of the second half of the year. That was before Trae went supersaiyan
"That’s cool and all, but this dude’s still talking about Jrue Holiday hitting a couple shots in the fourth being “lucky” like he’s some random scrub. That’s clearly stupid as shit.  Could have won the series comfortably in six if Jeff Green didn’t go 7/8 from three in game 5, but Jrue Holiday scoring 8 points in a quarter is lucky. Come on."
"True, but, Jrue Holiday was anything but cold tonight, yet he drew up the game tying three attempts for Connaughton and Middleton, both who were having bad shooting nights. Rough night or not for one of the top three, that’s on Bud."
"&gt; Size and height doesn’t stop Jrue Holiday from effectively guarding KD  Bro Pat Beverly is smaller and lighter than Jrue Holiday and KD is way less strong than Luka. KD can't even freaking bench 170. Also KD is not backing down anyone like Luka is. Luka was bodying Pat Beverly in the paint simply because he was bigger and stronger. Literally Luka is the same weight as KD if not heavier, and he is shorter so his center of gravity is lower. Do you play basketball you fucking moron? Get off the internet bozo.  &gt; Size and height doesn’t stop Jrue Holiday from effectively guarding KD  KD literally called Jrue Holiday the best guard defender in the league. Obviously Pat Beverly is not as good as Jrue fucking Holiday. Oh and KD still managed to average 35 ppg against him. Bro just be quiet Beverly haters are so weird. Like I wish I felt as passionately about something as much as you hate this man. Real lgbt attitude obsessing over another man like that. Nothing wrong with that, but you are giving off those vibes. You gay? You like dick?"
"They why are you drawing up plays for them to take more threes? Middleton is great in the midrange and has a nice floater, Jrue is an underrated player off the drive, Giannis is fucking Giannis, and Brook Lopez is 7ft tall and used to be a 20ppg scorer who could score from anywhere on the court. I get that the missed shots are on the players, but misusing them falls on Bud.  There’s no reason Jrue Holiday shouldn’t have been the one to take those game tying three attempts at the end of that game. The fact that he drew up plays for two dudes who we’re having g bad shooting nights instead is totally on him."
"""Jrue Holiday worst defender in the league confirmed. Trae Young is unguardable.""  Game 1 takes here!! Get your game 1 takes!!"
And with ther terrible job the Bucks have done building a team around him too. Hiring Mike Budenholzer and holding on to him and paying Kris Middleton a super max. Best they could muster was Jrue Holiday who is just not as good as a second scorer as they need.
"Size and height doesn’t stop Jrue Holiday from effectively guarding KD… look I said you’re welcome to your opinion and that PatBev is a good player, what the fuck else do you want? I don’t have to change my opinion just as you don’t have to change yours, I just think PatBev is a role player. In all honesty most of the league is full of role players. Some play roles better than others, some play roles more important than others. But PatBev is nothing more than a role player in my opinion."
Jrue Holiday can't guard Trae Young
"Yeah, I’ve been a Bud defender prior to this postseason. Before this, it really also fell on the players and then bad luck with Giannis getting hurt in the Bubble in an elimination game. You just can’t defend the coaching decisions from almost any game this postseason, especially the close ones that they should have won handily. With the injuries the Nets have, that series should have never had to go to a game 7. This game should have never come down to a one possession game when they were up by seven with less than three minutes to play, and they shouldn’t have relied on a dude who was 0-4 from three to take the game tying shot when, all game long, Jrue Holiday couldn’t miss if he tried."
"Giannis was defended by Blake Griffin, Trae was defended by Jrue Holiday.  Pretty stark difference."
that's the most plays i've ever seen a player make jrue holiday look regular on defense  trae is something else.  when the hawks went on the nate mcmillan tear i was like damn.     when trae reggie miller'd MSG i was like yo wtf he not only legit but he kinda likable (i hate the knicks btw).  after philly he completely won me over.  but now?  now he is setting records.  it's beyond confirmation.  he's a fuckin killer
"Shaq was being pedantic as shit.  The whole problem Kenny and Chuck had is that Jrue Holiday was left on an island and trying to keep Young in front of him while John Collins was lurking to screen him out of the play while Bobby Portis chilled under the rim. Chuck is right, that play was a microcosm of the Bucks defense on Young all game."
Trae is making Jrue Holiday and Giannis dance for his amusement
"Classic Bucks losing game 1 after taking control of the first half. Some things just never change. Wasted a rare Jrue Holiday game.  They just have to be consistent: Middleton as a walking bucket (those middies still deadly) and Holiday as a facilitator (and not so much of a scorer, altho his 10-14 points from finishing near the rim should be good). Also, that 4th quarter defense was some of the best that they played, hoping they keep that up."
"Booker has gone up against a team running Jokic at center which is an open shot on every PNR, a team missing their DPOY level PF, a team missing their all defensive forward lmao  Trae is matching up with Ben Simmons and Jrue holiday."
I love Trae Young. This man had the audacity to shimmy after crossing up Jrue Holiday. I love seeing dude just out there having fun.  Now ill probably love it a lot less when it's my team that's get shimmied but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
Also... Jrue Holiday basketball IQ is not great.
Against Jrue Holiday being the main assignment to check him  Looks like 76ers with exception of Danny Green actually contained Trae far better than whatever the Bux were doing tonight
Jrue Holiday wide open smh
God I love Jrue Holiday
jrue holiday &gt; trae young tbh
"Have the announcers always referred to Jrue as Holiday, even when he was on the Pelicans? I’m used to seeing people here say Jrue."
Jrue Holiday is a fucking KING
How much did Jrue Holiday smoke before the game? lol dude has the reaction time of a snail today. His brain is just gone.
If Suggs is Jrue Holiday then Mobley is Serge Ibaka LOL
Man jrue holiday has stepped up big time compared to last series
yo did solomon fucking hill just take jrue holiday off the dribble?  WTF
Jrue “Brook Lopez” Holiday
Jrue Holiday for the rest of this series because of that shimmy - “FUCK TRAE YOUNG”
Smart man that John Collins is knowing better than trying to post up Jrue Holiday
Jrue holiday earnings heard people talking shit about him in game 1.
I'm beginning to think that Jrue Holiday can't defend Trae Young
RIP Jrue Holiday  6/12/1990 - 6/23/2021
He did that to JRUE HOLIDAY 🥶
"If you’re doing that to Jrue Holiday, heck yeah you can flaunt it like that"
Hawks + Jrue Holiday are going off right now
Jrue Holiday sent to the phantom zone
Every time jrue holiday actually plays PG for bucks they get a good shot but everyone is so confused about their roles the offense is messed up.
Imagine if Ben Simmons could even shoot like Jrue Holiday
What happened to Jrue Holiday? If not for Ben Simmons collapsing he’d be winning the contest for biggest underperformer in these playoffs.
Trae is absolutely destroying Jrue Holiday right now
Jrue Motherfucking Holiday
There's the Jrue Holiday we've come to know and love
r/nba Allow me to introduce you to the real Jrue Holiday
"Bucks have a 2011 Miami Heat situation. All the stars try to cater to one another being hesitant then the offense struggles, then one gets over aggressive taking bad shots. Jrue holiday should take the ball up and be the engine setting up giannis. Middleton should be the third star and more spot up shooter, at least for this series."
jrue holiday has the cartoon network's sad dog face
"Miss called 2 vs 3 pointers a handful of times.  Got names wrong well over half a dozen times.  The best was calling Jrue Holiday Middle 3 times in like 5 seconds on the same play.  Ball goes out of bounds.  Ref signals it out of bounds.  ""Guess it was a foul!""  ""Oh, they changed it to out of bounds.""  No...  Oh, that was all in the 4th Quarter alone."
Should UCLA have started Jrue Holiday immediately?
6 foot 3 Jrue Holiday isn't scared to take it to the rim and slam it with someone in front of it but 6 foot 10 Ben Simmons passes up open dunks.   Feelsbadman.
Jrue Holiday. Oh deer.
jrue holiday 6'3 giannis
"JRUE HOLIDAY, THAT MAN HAS A FAMILY."
"He’s not “well ahead of Mobley” man come on. Suggs is a beast don’t get me wrong, but he’s more in the Jrue Holiday mold. Mobley has DPOY and perennial all star potential"
Jrue Holiday is gonna have a loooong night
"Look, I’m not gay, but if Jrue holiday put the moves on me, I may give in"
"Ok so you’d just stick with a squad of jrue as the best player, Thad young, nick young, Evan turner, j rich, lavoy Allen, spencer hawes, Justin holiday, dorell Wright. I picked the most notable names lol. And then use that cap space to sign someone? Nvm the fact that the biggest free agent signing the sixers signed in years was Elton brand coming off an Achilles tear. That team finished 34-48 so you’d prob be in the late lottery or you make some great free agent signings and make the playoffs and lose your first round pick to the magic. Love the plan so far! Also the sixers didn’t even finish with the worst record in the nba that first year (let alone in nba history lol)"
"Uhhh…these dudes about to lose. Maybe not the whole thing but they’re gonna lose a game. The first 5 is the ‘stacked’ part, but that bench is reminiscent of 2004. Team USA is usually filled with future hall of famers and like 8,9 even 10 guys who should/could start. This team has FIVE. That’s it: Dame, Beal, Booker, KD, Tatum. Everyone else would typically be a bench guy if they’d make thr team at all. Bam will start out of necessity but he isn’t dominating international comp like an AD, or Shaq, etc.   Team USA is supposed to be able to go with a 2nd 5 that is as good as the starters. This 2nd 5: Jrue (more on him later), Beal/Booker, Levine, Middleton, Draymond/Love.   That 2nd unit is not impressive. 1, you have a a lot of redundant players, and 2) you have NO 2ND POINT GUARD. In this format you absotlutely need floor generals.   2008: CP3, Deron Williams, Kidd  2012: Cp3, Deron Williams, Westbrook   2016: Kyrie, Lowry  Every team has at least one facilitator off the bench. Jrue holiday is not a facilitator. The one time USA lost who were their PGs? AI and Marbury. 2 scorers.   I haven’t checked social media so I don’t know if people are already saying this but yea these dudes are gonna lose. They have like 10 wings, a guard, and a big."
"Yes, I was saying that Jrue holiday doesn’t make it worse, like having Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybule does the 6’ers"
"Or Jrue holiday, Zach lavine, jerami grant, Kevin love, draymond green"
Jrue Holiday &gt; Drew Bledsoe
Wiggins is not a barely above replacement level player. He’s a very good third option. Elite one on one defense and like 18 ppg is not barely above replacement level. That’s legit jrue holiday level
"That's not the same as what Philly did. The Arenas era petered out, that's why you started rebuilding. Same for the Allen/Lewis Sonics.  The Sixers had disappointed with the the Brand/Bynum duo, but Hinkie traded away 22-year old All-Star Jrue Holiday for two picks (one of them was #5). They intentionally became the worst team in the league, they didn't just lose talent."
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"i strongly disagree. you're relying upon luck at that point rather than planning and strategy. the sixers had limited assets (owed FRPs) and the best player on the roster was jrue holiday. they were against the cap and their recent #2 pick sucked. the process was the quickest way to contention and that's proven to be true. they went from playoffs 7 or 8 seed to out of the playoffs for 4 years to multiple 50 win seasons.   https://www.landofbasketball.com/teams/records_philadelphia_76ers.htm  just look at the winning percentage of the franchise. outside of the fantistic run in the 80's when the NBA and rules were vastly different, the only two times the sixers have crossed the 60% win threshold were when they had Allen Iverson #1 pick and the process sixers. and they've done it 3 out of 4 years. literally the first time in franchise history they've won 60% of their games in 3 out of 4 seasons.  the goal was to create a sustainable and winning franchise with an opportunity to win championships. they've accomplished that goal despite getting butt fucked by the league."
"You are arguing with me about things I am not saying nor am I disputing.    All I am saying is that using a set of metrics to say one guy is bad and then seeing very similar metrics and saying that here other things are more important is a shitty argument. That’s all. I’m not trying to argue with you about how Bledsoe was or was not a better player than Jrue Holiday.    Holiday might be the best defender in the league. When you listen to players like KD, Dame, or Steph talk about him (see Redick’s pod) they say he is the best defender in the league. So I am fully aware of his value.    But no one is bringing up tangible evidence about their claim that Holiday is better. People took empirical data (stats) and said the data shows us that Bledsoe is bad but having similar data about Jrue does not tell us that Jrue is bad because of an eye test and clutch shooting.    If you’re going to use stats to make your point about one dude then you should be consistent in your use throughout. You should look at Jrue’s box score and use some other form of empirical data doesn’t tell us the full story. Eye test and clutch shooting is just a very lazy way to make an argument."
It’s a borderline circleJerk now.   “*Jrue Holiday Defence = Good*”  **9k Upvotes and 8 awards**
Randle had a bad series but was still competent enough to be on the floor. He has a skillset that makes him starter-worthy in the playoffs even if he played poorly. The same cannot be said for Simmons.  If you'd take Ben Simmons over Jrue Holiday then we have completely different evaluations on the sport of basketball and wouldn't accomplish much by even discussing it haha.
Lmao no one is fearing a Jrue holiday post up. They can just bring help off of Giannis
"1. Middleton, Giannis, Lopez and Holiday are four above average defenders. Embiid, Simmons, Thybulle are three above average defenders and one of them has the job of running the whole offense (Embiid). Bucks have more balance among the starting 5 and the perfect guard to make Trae work in Holiday. Work, not shut down. 2. Ben Simmons' D was actually decent it's just he was a nothing when it came to shooting, and it impacted how everyone else got played. Jrue Holiday is going to make Trae Young work on D when Trae gets switched onto him, that might fatigue Trae Young a bit.  3. The Bucks defense just put a beatdown on every Net not named Kevin Durant, Middleton makes a lot of clutch defensive plays, Giannis can be awesome as a second rim protector, Lopez has a ton of veteran experience to man the middle and knows his role. I think this team makes Clint Capela work a lot cause Gallinari is gonna be a liability more IMO."
"We still on about Brogdon? If we have Brogdon, we don’t have Holiday and I’d take Jrue every time."
"Jrue Holiday is probably one of the most disciplined defensive players in the league. So he definitely helps to stop Trae. Also, the bucks aren’t as limited on offense like the 76’ers"
"And this is why Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are going to determine this series in my opinion.  If they can play the pick n' roll effectively, the Bucks likely win in 5.  if they struggle it could be 7 or a loss.  But I trust Brook a even more than the average Milwaukee fan.  he's been our most consistent playoff performer the last 3 years, and he's elite at playing the pick n' roll when there's a lob threat.  He doesn't give away whether he's playing the lob or the shot until the very last second and still contends well on either.  Jrue also should be able to bother Trae from behind without getting caught as much as the average defender.  As long as they play to their normal capabilities, and the Bucks stay home on the other shooters, I think the Bucks will handle this series."
&gt;Gigantic upgrade  Jrue Holiday  Nets series: 15/4/6 on 42.8 TS%  Lol ok
Nets fans are calling that player Game 7 Jrue Holiday now
"I think we gotta agree to disagree on this as I've been hearing pretty much the opposite the all year. I think this all boils down to the Nets (and other superteams) having better odds at a championship at the cost of putting all their eggs (in this case playable minutes) in one basket (in this case All-NBA talent that is clearly a tier above talented All-Stars like Middleton and Jrue). Those odds didn't work out DESPITE having better odds, so in NO way can I take that away from the guys that had no choice (due to being in a less desirable team with contracts and players that weren't optimally signed from the beginning due to lack of collusion) but to take the direction of going for depth surrounding a superstar that was willing to be there. I think that's a pretty big piece of evidence as to why the Nets had a huge advantage and were exemplary of a desired franchise. The Bucks didn't even have the choice of doing what the Nets and superteams do which is to optimize a roster with like-minded players who are All-NBA players on a similar timeline with a CLEAN slate of cap space.   &amp;nbsp;  Don't kill me just yet, I know one of your main points is referring to how the actual teams looked when they met up in the playoffs. If this was simply an argument of whether Giannis can say he beat the Nets Big 3 or not, sure I can agree with you on that (just as I would with the Kawhi vs Hampton 5 GSW), but we're talking about how important his (currently-hypothetical) ring is, this ring is an award for a season-long race of both the regular season and playoffs, not just one series. Which is why I don't think Giannis' ring isn't considered massive when all the superteams that went into the season having better odds at the chip have been knocked out (despite superteams pretty much dominating the last decade of the NBA when healthy) while the others have been treading along and survived. The superteams took the direction they did and now they have to lay in the bed they made. Just like how you don't invalidate someone's win in chess if their opponent made a mistake much earlier in the game which costed them the game because it didn't pan out the way they thought it would.  &amp;nbsp;  I think we are talking a Lakers/Warriors superteam btw. The Warriors weren't like this before Steph either. All season I've heard no implication from others whatsoever that they believed the Bucks were better, especially coming off how they performed in the 2 seasons prior (despite the trade for Holiday). The Nets were not only the favorites, but people even went about saying that they could be the best team of all time to the point where I had to remind them to chill as we've never seen an offense-only team win it all not to mention how much it hinged on the health of their stars. Brooklyn is clearly a desirable franchise (as KD and Kryie chose it in FA and Harden demanded a trade there) for its location and the Knicks FO being a considered a mess before this season."
Boogie got hurt lol  AD got them to the 2nd round in 2018. Did you want him to beat the KD Warriors with Jrue Holiday as his best teammate?
"On somewhat of a similar note, All-Stars have turned out to be a pretty lazy way of assessing people like 10+ years after the fact. First it’s a half-season award. Second it’s so binary in such a way that makes it sound like there is a huge difference between an All-Star and non-All Star, where in reality there isn’t.   For example just look at this year with Ben Simmons. If the All-Star voting was done now, I guarantee Khris Middleton, Trae Young, and possibly even Jrue Holiday would receive more votes and be All-Stars over him. Yet when you look back on it 5-10 years from now, it makes it seem like Simmons had the “better year” if you just blindly use All-Star appearances."
I agree with CB!  What it showed was that The Bucks offense flows better when Jrue Holiday or Middleton are the primary ball handlers and facilitators and not Giannis.  Hoping Giannis sees that and makes the needed adjustments.
"His floor is not Jrue Holiday. He can’t guard wings like Jrue can. He’s a poor FT shooter, which some will say translates better to NBA 3p shooting. He also was a poor 3 point shooter the two seasons he played before this one."
Bosh isn’t a superstar but Jrue Holiday is? Right…
"His floor is a Jrue Holiday, which is already good. He has potential to be an all-star point-guard. Hell, maybe theres a chance that the Donovan Mitchell comparison actually come true. Anyway, Davion is my favorite player in this draft."
"Jrue holiday is playing great but the biggest beneficiary has been Brook Lopez. Giannis gone has Free’d up all the space in the paint for him to work, playing like nets lopez the last couple games"
"This is CP3’s best shot at a title. My gut feel tells me he’ll give it his all. Probably the best performance of his career. Jrue Holiday is the best guard defender according to Draymond and Lillard. However, considering all of CP’s years in the league, he’ll be unfazed and he’ll find a way to be effective."
Jrue Holiday embarrassed our whole team man. We could have beat them but he went super human. He doesn’t miss a ton of open shots.
I don't know if this Jrue Holiday posts are troll or real but its getting out of control.
Obviously following Jrue Holiday and K’VON Huerter
Obviously Jrue Holiday and K’VON Huerter. MJ is not in OP’s list
My dude out here applying to med school and telling Jrue Holiday GL trying to guard him
Imo it’s Jrue Holiday. Middleton is gonna have his bad games and Jrue will need to step up when that happens. He has been doing well lately so that’s a good sign for the Bucks
"agreed. a better example would be someone like jrue holiday lol. private, super private actually, but not weird"
It’s not relevant to you. But a team who didn’t buy their success definitely needs its starters. The Bucks built this team with smart decisions and a good coach. Nets paid some desperate dudes trophy hunting to attempt to win and they didn’t. Harden is a no factor and Kyrie would’ve been as useful as Jrue Holiday. The difference would have been minimal if at all.
Typically Jrue Holiday has good defense but he did have trouble guarding trae young in game 1.
Jrue Holiday
The Pelicans get miles turner and trade Eric Bledsoe for Jrue Holiday they in the finals!
A little bit of Ewing theory here as Giannis getting touches inappropriate positions and times in the offense messes up everybody  Jrue Holiday is overrated imo but in no way should he been playing and shooting  worse than Bledsoe in the playoffs
Jrue Holiday
"I could be wrong, but I don't think a lot of people were saying that they didn't have enough help this year. I think once they added Jrue Holiday, the consensus was that they had a lot of talent around Giannis. I have seen people saying that some of their guys don't fit together, and I've seen a lot of criticism of Bud, but those are different issues."
"i would definitely pick Bucks over Denver, Jamal isn’t gonna do his thing with guy like Jrue Holiday on him"
Now they're saying its a Jrue Holiday
Idk you’re still a team one superstar that’s fairly one dimensional. I’m don’t see how Bobby Portia and Jrue Holiday change that fact
"Yes, fundamentally the same team unless you completely ignore reality.  &amp;#x200B;  I guess Jrue Holiday, Bobby Portis, and PJ Tucker don't exist.  Totally the same team as long as you don't count two starters being replaced and a huge bench upgrade.  Stop posting you are embarrassing yourself"
"So they’re still FUNDAMENTALLY the same team. You keep Giannis away from the rim you only really have to stop Middleton who’s not a star. If you have star power, which is Suns do, then you’re going to beat them. Jrue Holiday doesn’t influence that dynamic"
Jrue Holiday and Marcus Smart.
"I didn’t say just Irving and Love. Every team the Warriors faced that year PG was injured Jrue Holiday, Pat Bev, Mike Conley plus Chris Paul was injured and John Wall. I mean hell the Thunder didn’t even make playoffs due to KD and Russ injuries it was a weird year."
Middleton and Jrue Holiday are a playoff team.without Giannis. Hawks are not. Also stop trying to compare us taking a full strength East vs you running through an injured East. You have yet to face a team as good as 2019 Sixers
Jrue Holiday
PG - Mike Conley or Lillard SG - Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler SF - Giannis PF - PJ Tucker C - Al Horford
"I'll give a controversial one that's going to get me downvoted to hell- SGA. He's awesome, don't get me wrong. But guard play is so deep and his defensive contributions will get overlooked by voters. I see him like a Jrue Holiday-- maybe one/two all-star nods, but probably just a cusp player that we'll look back on and think ""How did he not make more?"""

"While true, ESPN is just different. They’re the only station that feels the need to tell me that Jrue Holiday had a ham sandwich for lunch and then learned a new dance."
"I still think Lonzos Ceiling is a better Jrue Holiday, but that is not even close to being the case yet."
"Jrue Holiday is about to GO OFF to try to win the Finals MVP, lol"
Drew Holiday is a great artist at the top of his field. Jrue is probably top 40 tho
I don’t know who Drew Holiday is but Jrue is definitely better
"yeah so excited to see chris paul &amp; devin booker vs khris middleton and jrue holiday, just what I expected and wanted"
"If Giannis is healthy I’ll take the Bucks in 6, maybe 7   Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday have really stepped up lately compared to say Devin Booker who struggled games 2-5 against the clippers."
Davion is closer to Dort than he is to an aggressive Jrue Holiday in my opinion.
"I mean they do have Jrue Holiday, the most underrated NBA star over the last 5 or so years."
"Huerter truly was on fire that series. He does make the right reads and such was a horrid defender his second and first half of 3rd season. He was decent as a rookie. He has a high IQ and we expect him to make the right play, he used to be a point guard. The cause-effect of him torching you guys was him drawing a tougher defender the whole Milwaukee series. Seth Curry is a lot easier to score on them Jrue Holiday, Tucker, or Middleton.  Thybulle just needs to be a can’t leave open kind of shooter and master off ball cutting. You want him to focus on locking down his opponent. I’ve noticed that when players expand their game too much they forget what got them there. Collins used to be an absolute animal on both sides of the glass, but as his offensive game progressed, we saw him rarely hit the glass, especially on the offensive side. You might look at this stats in his 2nd and 3rd season and say how? He was 20/10, right? With the right positioning and discipline, he could actually lead the league in rebounding during the regular season. Half way through his second season I feel he forgot his greatest skill. He had stints in the playoffs where his offensive rebounding really shined but it was not consistent and hasn’t been for a long time despite the numbers. He grabs the number of rebounds he does now due to his incredible leaping ability."
"I think the two bookending front offices look a lot worse than Hinkie's. Colangelo trashing players on twitter burner accounts is obviously just gross, and the old front office selling the farm for Bynum who never played for no particular reason both look a lot worse than trading Jrue Holiday and Thad Young for draft picks.  Overall I think tanking is not great, but it made sense at the time with what the previous front office had done to wreck the team."
This is a strawman narrative that no one really argued for. The blame when they lost would go on Bud or some sort of Giannis can be gameplanned around idea. If anything people said they went too all in on getting him help with the Jrue Holiday deal.
"Giannis Antetkounmpo tonight:  0 points  0 rebounds   0 assists  0 steals  0 blocks  Middleton's Robin? Nope, that's Jrue Holiday."
Brook Lopez looking like his Nets all star self and Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are doing WORK with the scoring load with Giannis out. Suns vs Bucks about to be a gooooood fucking series!
Aggressive Jrue Holiday is scary
"""A spectacular layup by Middleton"" he says, as Jrue Holiday clearly drives through the lane makes a clutch layup"
Brandon Jennings and Jrue Holiday are somehow the same age.
No it's not that. However Giannis lack of spacing makes Jrue's drives and pnr harder.  But unless you think Jrue Holiday is about to pick and roll you to a championship its a tradeoff you'll take
"Brook Lopez, kris Middleton and jrue holiday. What a fucking combo.. they should just swap k love for brook López in the us squad."
"Jrue Holiday man of the match tonight, what a great overall performance from him (27/9/9 + 4 STL &amp; 2 BLK)!"
confusing bald headed Middleton with ninja bandana and braids Jrue Holiday was the tipping point for me
"Congrats to the Bucks, there's a non-zero chance that either Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday will win Finals MVP, especially if Giannis isn't fully healthy. Might be the craziest finals MVP winner since Iggy in 2015.  Jrue has been averaging great numbers, playing so well. Rooting for this guy."
Jrue Holiday saved their season along with Lopez and Tucker  Middleton shows up here and there
THIS IS WHY GIANNIS SIGNED THE SUPERMAX! HE BELIEVES THIS TEAM WAS GONNA BE SPECIAL AND LOOK AT IT NOW!  FINALS BOUND SINCE 50 YEARS!!   Was that Jrue Holiday and PJ tucker trade worth it?!
"Congrats to the Bucks, there's a non-zero chance that either Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday will win Finals MVP, especially if Giannis isn't fully healthy. Might be the craziest finals MVP winner since Iggy in 2015."
Jrue “the process” Holiday for Ben Simmons. Who says no?
Jrue Holiday is not Khris Middleton. Now they're saying he's Michael Jordan!
Now they're saying it was Jrue Holiday
"Jrue ""Now They're Saying It Was Kris Middleton"" Holiday"
"lmao at Marv Albert calling Jrue Holiday, Middleton"
"Marv going out calling Jrue Holiday ""Middleton"" over and over is pretty fitting"
Jrue Holiday oh my god
Jrue “Middleton” Holiday
Now they’re saying it’s Jrue Holiday
"""Here's Middleton on the drive"" *clearly Jrue Holiday*"
aka former Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday
&gt;Milwaukee Bucks’ guard Jrue Holiday aka Jrue Holiday  ...
Jrue Holiday just blocking everyone now  And Portis on fire too
jrue “never snooze” holiday
Jrue on a Holiday cruise
"Are we finally gonna get the ""Jrue Holiday defense"" game?"
Jrue Holiday weak asf
jrue holiday is so frustrating to watch
Bucks fans does jrue holiday always miss open 3s? Swear from this series he’s been way better off the dribble or contested compared to the wide open ones
Jrue Holiday is shorter and weighs less than Collins but can just bully him in the post all day lol
Wonder why tucker is on trae. Jrue holiday is a much better matchup
Bucks really gave up 3 first round picks for Jrue Holiday. 3 first round could have been used to get a Beal level player
Jrue Holiday got going tho
"Did he really have better teammates tho?  Outside of this year his two best teammates were D'Angelo Russell for like a couple games, Andrew Wiggins and Jimmy Butler  Boogie not counting Golden State has played with jrue holiday, IT (for a short time), AD and rondo"
"The Pelicans were awful, and AD always performed admirably when he got there. There's no shame in losing to the Warriors when Jrue Holiday is your second best player.   I'm not worried about AD's health or his performance."
"To your last point, OKC also started their rebuild in a much better place being able to deal PG and Westbrook for a ton of picks. We started out with Jrue Holiday"
"I agree with the process being a marketing thing, but disagree with your conclusion.  The point of the process was that to contend, you need an mvp level candidate, and the best way to get one was with consecutive high draft picks.   And there was a vein of thought that borderline max guys are bad. A team of jrue holiday/Simmons/Harris would be pretty bad, right? If they were your 3 best players"
"The Process is as much a marketing slogan as it is a team-building strategy. And it's genius as far as PR/marketing is concerned is that it can't fundamentally fail, it can only be failed.   Like even look at this thread and see how many people claiming that like Tobias Harris is an example of the Process working, when the original logic of the whole model was that guys like Harris (and more directly, Jrue Holiday, who btw is now a key piece of a possible title team) aren't worth having on your roster because they're not true superstars. But if you keep changing the goals and you've already made your fans accept that losing doesn't prove anything negative about your strategy, you can ultimately get them to eat as much shit as you want, and on that point the Process is and will continue to be a resounding success."
The Cavs were the only injury riddled team they played in 2015. The injuries on other teams wouldn’t even make an ESPN headline in any other championship run. Jrue Holiday was injured in January and his team made the playoffs without him. Mike Conley missed one game. He played every other game and he was available when his team was up 2-1. The Warriors beat every member of the All NBA first team in that playoff run which has never been done before. I’ve never met anyone who actually believes any of the injuries to ancillary players in that championship run would have actually made the difference if they played.
Yeah I dunno why everyone sweats draft picks so much.  The real value is undervalued people looking for their 2nd or 3rd contract.  Jrue Holiday.  Reggie Jackson.  You sign the right undervalued people... then bam
"Ah yes, long time Milwuakee resident Jrue Holiday and Phoenix Suns veteran Chris Paul, built from the ground up"
Jrue Holiday finally realized he’s strong as fuck and can just mow down all the scrawny Hawks guards lmfao
"Lol you don't see Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Brooke Lopez matching the play of Pat Beverly and Boogie? Are you fucking kidding me rofl. Jesus this sub is bad"
"I thought the Bucks did a better job forcing the Suns into tougher shots, not settling for the Paul/Booker vs Lopez 1 on 1s, and Giannis did almost all he could tonight.  It's just hard to win when Booker makes a shit ton of well contested shots, CP3 gets to his sweet spot, and the other role players are reliable from 3 while the Bucks get Jrue League Holiday and Khris Humphries."
Jrue Holiday was labeled as underrated for so long that he’s become very overrated
"Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday and Khris ""That's Not the Celtics"" Middleton rear their ugly heads."
"The Suns played well tonight knocking down the majority of their open looks (shooting 50% from three on 20/40) -- but they honestly still aren't the story as they were consistent while the combination of Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton dug a big enough hole that even Antetokounmpo's MVP-like performance couldn't drag them out of it.  Giannis was unstoppable tonight with 42 on 22 shots, 20 of those in the 3^rd where he scored 13 in a row himself, but all that spectacular work was undone with the lackluster contributions from Holiday and Middleton who shot 8-30 (2-8 from three) prior to the 4^th quarter and finished 12-37 and only 28 points.  All that being said, the Bucks shouldn't be demoralized as the Suns did what they were supposed to do and held home court advantage. The Bucks just have to expect more from Holiday and Middleton, who are both usually better at home, so this series is far from over."
Jrue Holiday is a fucking fraud lmao. Choking on the biggest stage.
"I look forward to the inevitable press conference when Jrue Holiday says "" I just need to be more aggressive"""
"Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are a disgrace.  Poor Giannis, risking everything while his teammates are shooting bricks"
wow khris middleton and jrue holiday just fucking wow
Keys for the Bucks to not fuck this series up:   Less possession for anyone not Giannis   More possessions for guys named Giannis   Jrue Holiday is not allowed to shoot anything but a layup   Less fucking 3s.
At least Jrue Holiday has played great defense. So his poor shooting night gets an excuse.  JFC Middleton. Absolute disaster. And he's being paid 33 million!!!!
Bucks really blew all their flexibility for Jrue Holiday and PJ Tucker
Jrue Holiday takes off his mask it’s just Bledsoe
Man if I was bucks fans I’d be fucking pissed at how inconsistent Jrue Holiday and Kris Middleton are
Reggie Jackson clearly Space Jam'd Jrue Holiday
Were you the one that Space Jam'd Jrue Holiday?
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Suns game when gunshots rang out in my house. It turns out the sound was just Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down you two!
Oh shit Jrue Holiday saw me talking trash about him and 3 first round picks
Three first round picks for Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday is simply not good enough to be a lead playmaker on a title contender. It's sad that Giannis has to be held back by a mediocre core.
Giannis coming back leashed Jrue Holiday.
Sir Charles said Giannis getting hurt was ultimately good because it unleashed aggressive Jrue Holiday.  That take is not panning out.
Jrue Holiday is just a shorter Andrew Wiggins.
So sad Giannis makes it here and Jrue Holiday says no.
Jrue Holiday has been straight trash
Jrue Holiday is garbage man
"Jrue Holiday ladies and gentleman, Jrue Holiday"
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday just wasting a generational performance from Giannis smh
Why the f*** can't jrue holiday make layups
Jrue Holiday trick yall.
Jrue Holiday on offense looks like a random r/NBA'er at a fantasy camp
Jrue holiday is trying to do the Ben Simmons thing where you play really good defense and hope that people forget you're shooting 25% on 20 attempts.
Well when Jrue Holiday bricks 13 shots that’ll fucking do it.
Jrue Holiday is angling to win the 2021 inaugural Ben Simmons Least Valuable Player award. LVP LVP!
"Jrue holiday has made only one more shot than PJ Tucker. Let that sink in, boys."
"Poor Giannis has Middleton and ""Underrated"" Jrue Holiday shitting the bed at the highest level possible."
jrue holiday: title chances AND fastbreak killer
Jrue Holiday the sabotager
Would you rather have Ben Simmons or Jrue Holiday?
Jrue Holiday should watch Chris Paul film on mid range shooting.
Imagine trading 3 first round picks for Jrue Holiday.
A Jrue Holiday shot on offense is the defensive equivalent of the free space on a bingo card.
Jrue “already on” Holiday misses the 2
Jrue Holiday arrested tomorrow on fraud charges?
"Nope it's totally  Bud's fault, he needs to get in there and ADJUST  I'm telling you, he is not A D J U S T I N G  If he adjusted Jrue Holiday would not brick 5 open layups because he's Bledsoe 2.0 that Bucks fans keep talking shit to"
A top 20 player all time for the most hot and cold shooter in the league and Jrue Holiday? What is this question?
milwaukee got drew holiday instead of jrue
Accompanied by Jrue Holiday tho lol
"Again with this shit? LMAO every time there's cameras on coaches go full generic 2k shit and don't actually say anything meaningful  Bruh they find a reason to hate everything this  guy does, i want him to suit up and make more layups than trash ass Jrue Holiday"
"JRUE ""DREW"" HOLIDAY IS 4 for 16.  Or, for optimists, 1 for 4!"
"No Giannis needs to be a better playmaker. Fault the player getting paid super max money for making life actively harder for his teammates in the half court. Jrue has missed a couple open layups sure, he’s also expending moe energy than anyone on the court. If Jrue holiday was playing off ball like his skill set fits he’d be performing way better and thats ditto for Middleton. Instead they’re being asked to create for themselves and others."
"Jrue holiday is so overrated man. Every time I look at these box scores he’s like 2-9. Today he’s 4-16 lol.  He must finish every game strong cuz his playoff numbers aren’t thaat bad, but man I swear he’s under 30% in the 3rd quarter every game."
I seriously don’t want to hear ever again how underrated Jrue Holiday is. If he was even mediocre the Bucks could have won either of these two games.
Looks like Jrue...took an early Holiday.  YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
nah that shot seals it. marcus smart is way better than jrue holiday wtf was that
Jrue holiday in the conference finals. Jrue Bledsoe in the finals
Jrue Holiday is just gonna hand the Suns the trophy. Hopefully they give him finals MVP at least.
Holiday Inn &gt; Jrue
Jrue needs to have a baby right now Jrue Holiday Jr
"Khris Middleton 20:56 played, 2-10 from the field  Jrue Holiday 18:35 played, 3-14 from the field.   The Bucks where outscored 30-16 in the second half.   Yet you're losing your mind over a bog standard charge (that giannis didnt even get called for lmao)  Hold this L."
Imagine giving up your entire future for Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday gonna tweet “I Don’t wanna be here” after the game
Jrue is either former all star jrue holiday or bucks legend jrue Bledsoe. There's no in between
Not sure if I'm seeing Jrue Holiday or Eric Bledsoe out there
we just sit here and waited for woj to say jrue holiday needs to be better. This is hilarious
The irony of the Bucks paying 4 times the amount for Jrue Holiday only to get roasted by CP3 who they could have gotten for 1 pick is hilarious
&gt;Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton combine for 5-24 from the field currently  At least Jrue's defense has been good but damn. What is up with him
Jrue Holiday doing a 2016 Harrison Barnes impression.
Crowd is part of it but the bucks are just getting nothing on offense from holiday this series. If Jrue was playing closer to his regular season averages this series and game would be much closer
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday need to do some soul searching
jrue holiday needs the heimlich maneuver quick
"Man I feel bad for Jrue Holiday. Guy's the best defensive PG in the league and a legit All Star, but he's been ass so far these Finals."
i did not know jrue holiday's last name was actually for remembrance holidays of 9/11 and the like the depressing holiday variant
"At what point do you bench Jrue Holiday? I mean he’s been awful this series, just sayin."
"Bledsoe, Hill, 3 FRPs, 2 pick swaps for Jrue Holiday btw. Y'all can't tell me they couldn't have gotten anyone better. CP3 was right there lmao."
jrue holiday will burn in hell next to joe harris
The difference between you haters and Jrue Holiday (and any NBA player for that matter) is that you actually suck at basketball.
Khris “Batman” Middleton and Jrue “poor man’s Eric Bledsoe” Holiday carrying the Suns’ defense
Imagine being giannis playing your heart out injured and jrue holiday is 3/14 and Middleton is 2/10.
He might murder Jrue Holiday
Jrue holiday is selling harder than Bledsoe ever did. His defense is cool but who fucking cares when you shoot 3-14 in *one half*??
Can Jrue Holiday make a layup challenge
"*Jrue Holiday rips off his mask at halftime*  IT WAS ME ALL ALONG EVERYBODY! I NEVER GOT TRADED TO NEW ORLEANS, ERIC BLEDSOE IS BACK BOYS!"
Jrue Holiday is painful to watch
Suns MVP Jrue Holiday
Bucks lose this game because Jrue is on a holiday
Looks like Jrue went on his Holiday already.
"Jrue ""Khris Middleton"" Holiday"
Jrue holiday not welcome in Milwaukee no more 😂
Jrue taking the Holiday last name a bit too seriously
"jrue ""cancun"" holiday"
Jrue holiday in his BAG
I’m not even a bucks fan but holy shit this team makes me angry. Jrue holiday and Middleton are so inconsistent it’s crazy. Either there amazing or garbage. And so far there the latter
Jrue holiday = anti Ben Simmons with shot confidence
"If anyone ever wondered why AD didn't win much down in N.O. I present, Jrue Holiday"
Will the real Jrue Holiday please stand up
"If Jrue Holiday drops out of the Olympics after this poor finals performance, who would replace him? Tyler Herro?"
Get Jrue Holiday some help
jrue holiday is giving his all this half god damn
Jrue Holiday or Dwyane Wade? Jfc.
Bold move by Jrue Holiday going up for that block
I like Jrue Holiday?
It’s crazy too considering show time Lakers and the Heatles both had multiple stars and intriguing role players. They’ve had success with other models. Like everyone loves Caruso and THT on the Lakers and they’re rotation guys. People who watch basketball know how good Jrue Holiday is at defense and it’s like the 4th or 5th talking point when ESPN talks about the bucks.
"Not always -  there have always been a couple role players on the rosters. Kirk Hinrich, Shane Battier, Tyson Chandler, Kenneth Faried and Mason Plumlee have all played big roles over the years.    But in any case, I don't agree that this year's roster lacks role players. Draymond and Bam are definitely role players - they're just really, really good role players. Jerami Grant has become a scorer, but he was viewed as a 3-and-D wing only 1 year ago. Kevin Love, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday have spent plenty of time in complementary roles in their day."
"Darius Garland will be among three guys promoted to Team USA for the team’s exhibition games, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.   Keldon Johnson and Saddiq Bey will also join Garland, as the trio will replace Devin Booker, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday up until the conclusion of the NBA Finals.  source : https://fortyeightminutes.com/darius-garland-among-select-team-players-promoted-to-team-usa/"
"Not even that, lots of super hard working players like Jimmy Butler, Jrue Holiday, Demar Derozen are great free throw shooters but can’t hit 3’s consistently.  The range required to hit 3’s just isn’t something that’s correlated with free throw percentage."
Jrue holiday better get all of lavines minutes come game time.
"We brought in former All Stars: Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Rajon Rondo. We swung and missed on Solomon Hill and Etwaun Moore. It's an absolute fallacy that the Pelicans didn't do everything possible to win. We took a game in the postseason from the Hampton Warriors after losing Boogie to a freak injury. We had a top 5 team in the league (Cavs, Warriors, Rockets were the only ones better at the end of '18 for sure.)  Then all of a sudden ADisney has no help and wants out. Our front office's incompetence is greatly exaggerated. ADisney is just soft and is best as an auxiliary piece rather than the main piece.   The only poor thing you can say that this front office has done so far since ridding ourselves of a lying cancer is how we handled JJ. Jrue wanted out and we got a treasure trove of picks. We're set up to be a huge buyer at the deadline / next offseason when the timeline for Zion/BI starts right. We may let Lonzo walk but I'll see it when I believe it.   Bad take."
"That’s not true. The people who actually hold down the viewership during the regular season want real basketball. The nba is a joke because it caters to casual fans who only want to watch Lebron vs KD or Lebron vs Curry and don’t know anyone other than superstars.  The NFL for all its faults doesn’t treat the fans like complete idiots and markets the entire team and more than just the QBs. There’s a reason Richard Sherman and JJ Watt are household names. In the nba, casuals have no clue who Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, or Bam Adebayo are despite them being amazing defensive players and with good personalities."
it's worked in the past. sure giannis gets walled off but Kate and Bledsoe would still brick their open looks. jrue holiday been playing like bledsoe with playmaking
"Acquiring Jrue Holiday, the guy that put your team over the hump to get to the finals this year, &amp; Trading for his literal BFF at the time and ALL NBA Center Demarcus cousins wasn’t enough? A healthy Jrue AD and Cousins with a solid bench at the time would have easily been a top 4 seed every year. Shit happens, we fucked up other moves. But don’t act like we didn’t even try."
"There is a reason why milwaukee got rid of Eric Gordon and replaced him with Jrue Holiday. You draft Cade on the rookie contract.  Don't be foolish to trade for a mid tier caliber player like Gordon.  Houston would have to offer 3 unprotected first round picks, including the 2nd pick this draft, to begin the conversation for the #1 pick."
"This just isn’t true. CP3, Curry, Harden, Lilliard, Ja Morant, Jrue Holiday, Trae Young, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell are all playmaking guards all ranked in the top 13 in assists last year. The only guys not from the US in the top 15 in assists were Luka and Ben Simmons"
"I didn't say Jrue wasn't a playmaker, but CP3 is a better one and guys like KD and Dray will probably listen to CP3 over someone who is barely an allstar. Also, in the playoffs it seems like Holiday needs to be at home to get going, there are no home games in the Olympics."
"When you got guys like Zack Lavine instead of Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday instead of Steph Curry..."
"He’s unguardable because how much he foul baits. When you cannot get close to someone without them initiating contact to draw a foul obviously they’re going to get open shots.        I’m not saying he’s not a good player and good scorer, but he gets in peoples heads. Jrue Holiday literally w as guarding him in the playoffs with one hand behind his back so he wouldn’t have harden attempt to grab his arm.        The only truly unguardable player in the NBA feels like KD, because he is a true 3 level scorer without using any gimmicks at all 3 levels to get what he wants."
"(just my opinion)  1. defense: usa doesnt have a post-defender - therefore they're dependent on beal, lavine &amp; lillard to play good defense - didnt work these two games; the amount of easy paint points for australia was astonishing &amp; the us team overall is pretty bad at defending the three 2. offense: the chemistry doesnt seem to be there - too many plays resulted in four guys standing outside &amp; one trying to create  should they be one of the best in history though?  no kawhi, curry, klay, lebron, ad, butler, pg13, cp3, harden, irving, trae young, jrue holiday, zion, mitchell, booker"
This team needs Jrue Holiday bad.
If defense was actually half the game Thybulle would be a starter and Lillard wouldn't be making 1st team All NBA and Jrue Holiday would be the best guard in the league.
"Speaking of “career”   I do know that for their career Steph is 10-0 against Dame in the playoffs, I also know that the last time they played against each other in the playoffs, Steph averaged 36.5/8.3/7.3 on 47/42.6/93.8 while “most clutch player in the league” put up 22.3/4.8/8.5 on 37/36.8/88.5 shooting.  And oh yes before you want to pick out a terrible series from Steph because I know you want to, mind I point you to the 2018 playoff series that Dame played against the pelicans, and how jrue holiday made him look like a 2 way contract player."
Booker middleton and jrue  holiday will come after the finals is over
Jrue Holiday will help
Jrue Holiday will be the savior of Team USA.
"Team USA lacks a playmaking guard and defense. Jrue Holiday will be huge for them once he arrives. But amazing game to watch nonetheless, from down 10 to up 8, great game from the boomers"
Jrue Holiday ain’t fixing this complete lack of playmaking and shot creation on this team.  Should have asked Westbrook or Trae to join
Jrue Holiday ain’t fixing this complete lack of playmaking and shot creation on this team.   Should have asked Westbrook or Trae to join
USA need jrue holiday to carry their defense.
"Jrue holiday instantly improves the defense at least, him and Draymond together should put a ton of pressure on offenses"
How scary is it that Jrue Holiday is important for this team because he’s the only point guard outside of Dame on the roster.  Was Trae Young not available?
"Simmons would use a movie allegory instead.  ""Giannis is like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. He's technically perfect, but he needs Tom Cruise to get over the hump. I don't know if Jrue Holiday can be Rainman Tom Cruise. Maybe Risky Business Tom Cruise though."""
"We are missing Devin Booker, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday who are currently playing in the NBA finals. Which is dumb why would NBA played its Finals weeks before Olympics."
1. CP3  2. Alphabet man  3. Devin Bricker  4. Deandre Oldman  5. Jrue Holiday  6. Khris Brickaton
Because he's a Jrue Holiday level player if you haven't noticed.
"The Lowry and Gasol trades are not comparable at all.  If you want to find a comparable trade, look at the Conley to Utah trade. That's the type of value Lowry would have in today's market. But Masai was asking for Jrue Holiday level value"
"I knew we were losing this game, the Bucks are very good and it was must win for them. It shocked me that we started off that good with Booker in his worst night of the year (I am extremely afraid he might be injured given Monty also pulled him in game 2 just so he doesn't play a fucking 1 extra minute, but it might be me making excuses for my favorite player), but the Bucks made their runs in the spots they had to, had some positive variance, and took a huge momentum boost of a win.  I do not think the Bucks got the Suns ""figured out"". The Suns go as far as their best player, Devin Booker, takes them, and he took them nowhere last night. I am still confident we can get game 4. This to me is a ""good for them"" game, like game 3 vs the Clippers was. The big difference is Giannis Sina-Ugo Antetokounmpo. He's too good, too big, too fast, too strong, AND for the first time in his playoff career, he gets the 50-50 calls instead of being screwed for being too big. Unfortunate (and curious) timing for it to happen.  Monty is a great pre-planner. So he just needs to figure things out. I think he thought Bud would play the shot-quality game and go with the game 2 game plan, but with the way they limited corner three attempts we went with plan B, which is more Ayton and more above the break threes to get that shot gravity back. Other than Crowder, everyone missed everything. We were still great from midrange, but that's just what we do. Jrue ""50% true shooting"" Holiday hitting 5/10 threes sucks, but good for him for responding after all the shit he's gotten this playoff run.  If there's one huge non-Giannis problem, is the offensive boards. Bucks are great at them. Other than that, I remain convinced that we can win this series, especially since Bud is allergic to playing Brook Lopez big minutes.   Shout out to my guy Cam Johnson. If Book isn't injured and he just played like shit, then it's time to bounce the fuck back, split the away games and come in to a roaring PHX Suns Arena."

Jrue holiday is somehow the most overrated and underrated pg in the league
"Ayton was ok against Giannis on defense, dominated early offensively. Got into foul trouble in the 3rd, which meant yet another Giannis masterclass. Jrue Holiday was on fire in the 3rd, Bobby Portis and Rebounding eventually blew the game wide open"
"It sounds like your projecting onto Giannis a narrative that *you* want to exist. The truth of the matter is: you don't know what Giannis was saying. I know what clip your talking about and its not possible to be clear that he was ""pouting.""  I agree with your point about the Bucks needing to find the three ball. I'd argue that their Game 3 performance was indicative of an upward trend, especially with Jrue and Khris getting more involved. But you're kidding yourself if you think Giannis has nothing to do with that. He started the game with like five assists in the first quarter to get his teammates involved.  Also, your comment said nothing of Deandre Ayton's impact. If Ayton is in foul trouble, I'm dumping it to Giannis EVERYTIME. Ayton is the only player (maybe aside from Crowder) that can impact Giannis in anyway defensively. I don't expect the Suns to be this down bad in Game 4, but I also don't expect the bucks to get comfortable now either. They've come back from 0-2 before.  Your comment also implies that the Suns had a poor shooting performance based on their own inability to hit shots, but that's not true. The Bucks were taking away the three ball as an option. Booker was taking terrible shots and couldn't get into a rhythm. Paul was not as bad, but he seemed like a non-factor for most of the game. Both of these players were impacted because Jrue Holiday woke up defensively and the bucks never put themselves in a position to have Lopez on either of them.  This last paragraph is gonna be ranty, but what is ""The Man?"" What is that concept and why does it exist in sports. Being ""The Man"" is a completely relative concept that depends on *your* style of leadership. You could be a psychopath like Jordan or Kobe, or you could be more reserved and team first like Russel or Duncan. There are many different ways to win in basketball, and I'm sure that Giannis will figure out his way of doing so. I'm sure he's not worried about some random redditor's concept of leadership dictating how he's going to communicate to his teammates.  Edit: A word"
Jrue Holiday is either nobody or a top 5 guard in the nba
"The Bucks are not statistically good at making 3s, only their volume is consistent. Jrue Holiday had 11 attempts in 15 minutes g2, with 6 attempts over the same time span in g3. When Giannis drives to the lane and gets collapsed on, that means someone else has a open shot. My point is that you are being hyper critical of Giannis, when his teammates have been getting plenty of opportunities to impact the game, but just haven’t found the rim. He’s averaging 40/10, give the man his respect."
"Giannis ""Robin"" Antetokounmpo, Khris ""Batman"" Midddleton,  Jrue ""Nightwing"" Holiday, and PJ ""Ace the Bat-Hound"" Tucker."

"I feel like Jrue Holiday had a great game, Middleton just needs to be super aggressive when Giannis is out of the game"
Ah yes. Jrue and Holiday the dynamic duo
"The thing is when Jrue or Holiday have a good game it is enough for them and they start to go on a roll, at least that’s what I’ve seen."
"Hell, Jrue holiday is shooting 19/49 (39%) in the finals"
"Bucks paying that man $160m, I think they want him to be a bit more than just Tony Allen  They want the Jrue Holiday that showed up tonight, not whoever the fuck was that clown in game 1"
Was that before or after Jrue Holiday cashed in like four 3s right in a defender's face in the second half?
"I haven’t seen many people criticizing giannis, he’s been great.  It’s really Jrue holiday, sometimes Middleton and some role players i think deserves criticism"
"Jrue ""not Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday showing why he's worth Bledsoe and 3 picks."
The Jrue Holiday we expected played tonight. Book was shook
Jrue Holiday hates free Tacos you heard it here first.
"No because Bud didn't adjust remember?  Adjustments are key, see he didn't adjust that game and made Jrue Holiday miss open layups"
Jrue holiday stop shooting 3’a
"Jrue Holiday is +24 now. Is that good enough for you, milwaukee fans??"
"Scott Foster turned Jrue Holiday into Klay Thompson, when will Chris Paul catch a break???"
Jrue “Wardell Stephen Curry” Holiday
"Just not Phoenix’s day: Ayton foul trouble, missed free throws, missed open looks, Booker goes cold, trouble rebounding, bad turnovers and Jrue Holiday making shots.  Really the perfect storm."
That damn Scott foster! He rigged this game by teaching jrue holiday how to make shots again
Jrue Bird Holiday
Jrue holiday is icy hot
"Who predicted the Jrue Holiday Cam Johnson Dawkins Duel, and can you tell me the Lottery numbers?"
Jrue Holiday redemption game. Thank god
Jrue Holiday has horrible shot selection. Your not Harden stop with the step backs bum
Jrue is back from Holiday
"Jrue ""I'll do it myself"" Holiday"
Where was this Jrue holiday the last two games???
Jrue Holiday revenge tour
JRUE HOLIDAY WOKE UP
The Jrue Holiday game lol
Holy shit Jrue Holiday can’t miss rn.
The Jrue Holiday and Cam Johnson game
Jrue holiday is so up and down. Must be infuriating for bucks fans
" welcome to the finals, jrue holiday!"
Who called the Cam Johnson/Jrue Holiday shootout game?
"Jrue Holiday is either extremely underrated or overrated, but I can't tell which."
"Jrue Holiday starts a game of hot potato with 4 defenders, and Giannis slams it down to end the fun"
Lmao. I've never seen a worse finisher than jrue holiday. It's kind of amazing really.
Jrue still on Holiday mode. He's frozen
The jrue holiday pass to crazy eyes
Yes. Jrue Holiday is extremely hot.
"Am I the only one who thinks Jrue Holiday is so enjoyable to watch when he’s hot, especially in playmaking."

Jrue Holiday is now Boujee Bledsoe
He is giving me Jrue Holiday vibes from this season
Jrue Holiday is just…disappearing
Jrue holiday needs to stop shooting 3’s. He’s abysmally bad at them
"jrue still on holiday, someone needs to wake this bum up"
"Bucks can't even get better because they paid out their ass for Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday..."
Quarter Pounder Commercials: 1  Jrue Holiday 3 Pointers: 1-4
I think any of us who have followed the playoffs deep down inside know neither Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are good enough #2's to win a title.   Am I wrong?
Jrue “Eric Bledsoe” Holiday
Jrue Holiday destroys any semblance of momentum the Bucks get every single time.
I know it’s unpopular because he’s a good player but Jrue Holiday. He kind of hunches over all the time and his form looks so weird to me. He’s inconsistent offensively but the most annoying part is the way he drives. He does a lot of sneaky push offs in the lane and he often doesn’t look fluid to me.
Jrue Holiday vlog - Road to Shang Hai - Holiday 1 😭😭
Jrue Holiday is joining after the Finals
Go get Jrue Holiday instead of Eric Bledsoe
Jrue Holiday is who Chris Paul thinks he is
JRUE IM NOT ERIC BLEDSOE HOLIDAY
Folks really call MJ the goat when Jrue Holiday is playing like this🤔
Jrue should be the primary defender on Book. He’s drawing fouls on PJ and CP3 is not really in rhythm. This was a great play on both ends. Holiday has a great game 1/4 games smh. If only he stayed at this level offensively. The defense is always there.
If Jrue Holiday is playing like he should and Giannis is hitting his jumpers then the Bucks are not going to lose very often

Jrue isn’t like elite or anything but the drop off from holiday to Teague might be the biggest dropoff in the nba just because of how bad Teague is
Well I was not expecting that. What a quarter from Jrue Holiday and Bucks are back in it.

"If Bucks win, this will be known as the Jrue Holiday Layup game"
"If Chris Paul got a restraining order on Jrue Holiday, Suns in 4."
If the bucks are gonna get good Jrue Holiday tonight they gotta find a way to win
"Jrue Holiday makes a layup (2021, colorized)"
Watching Jrue Holiday make a layup must be like watching your puppy walk downstairs by itself for the first time.
Idk what the record is for most layups bricked in the finals is but I’m 100% sure that Jrue Holiday shattered it already in this series
So how much did Jrue Holiday get again?
If I am Jrue Holiday I give my contract back and apologize
Jrue Holiday make a layup challenge
Jrue “Andre Drummond” Holiday at it again with these layups
Is there anyone at any level of organized basketball thats worse at layups then Jrue Holiday￼?
getting Jrue Holiday 3rd foul would be huge for the Suns
How has Jrue Holiday forgotten how to hit layups.. LAYUPS
Jrue holiday is straight dogwater these are layups man

Y’all see the importance of Jrue Holiday now for the Bucks?
Jrue Holiday looks like a lunch lady
Your not talking about jrue holiday are you
Jrue Holiday offensive bounce back game baby
"Jrue Holiday does nothing for them, he's been ass in the playoffs  He's been pulling Bledsoes all playoffs, he doesn't move the needle for the Blazers"
"If we're going down that route, if you swap CP3 and Holiday right now. The Suns would have no chance. Yes, Jrue is doing a great job on guarding CP3 right now, but that's literally his only job, anything else you get from Jrue is a bonus. CP3 is being asked to orchestrate the entire Suns offense, hit clutch shots, defend well, and lead his team so it's not even close to a fair comparison. If CP3 has a bad game, the Suns have little to no shot in winning, if Jrue has a bad game, the Bucks can still win, you're comparing a 1st option to a 3rd option."
"Don't say that, stay positive. We didn't get here by accident. We've yet to have our Jrue Holiday game and the Sun's have no real way to prevent Giannis from dropping 25 points. Jrue will continue to full court press CP3 and make it hell for him. If we come out and everything is firing on full cylinders, we win by 15."
What an asinine argument.  It was a playoff series that AD completely outplayed Lillard in...  And we can compre their playoff careers too if you want.   &gt;Don't take teammates into account?   Jrue Holiday vs Nurkic and CJ  &gt;Is Devin Booker a better #1 than Nikola Jokic? Is he a better #1 than Lebron?  How is this remotely relevant?
"This entire thread is one comment I made that people kept replying to? Anyway I have no idea what your point is. Maybe Jrue&gt;Ben Simmons, I don't really care. All I'm saying is that I find it funny how transparently people emphasise and minimise certain factors depending on whether or not they like the player. Ben Simmons is a very good player good at several different things with a positive impact the majority of the time, yet he's been reduced solely to a target of abuse. Holiday is not so much less flawed offensively to the point where people can write it off and just wax lyrical about his defence"
"Bucks are in the finals largely because of how Jrue showed up in the fourth quarter of game 7 against the nets. How’s that for an argument?   Like your argument is kind of insane. You’re criticizing the Bucks, yet we’re tied 2-2 in the NBA finals. Chris Paul would never have stayed in Milwaukee past this season, clearly Holiday was interested in doing that all along."
"But having Chris Paul instead of Jrue Holiday wouldn't have changed them losing to a fully healthy Nets, so that's a moot argument for the context of this conversation"
You're delusional if you don't think Booker would've been a step up from Drew Bledsoe and every other bum ass point guard you've had to this point until Jrue Holiday.
CP3 needs it more than anyone and i think the Suns are happier. Jrue Holiday chasing him around all game looks like its working
Let me introduce you to my Lord and savior Jrue Holiday
Okay now I know you’re a casual. Jrue Holiday and PJ Tucker my guy

Remind me to never steal anything from Jrue Holiday.
Jrue Holiday changes everything    Not Eric Bledsoe changes even more
u mean jrue holiday is a huge upgrade over bledsoe?
Jrue Holiday goes through screens as if they were nonexistent
"Lebron : the 2011 finals  Harden : being outplayed by Jonathon Simmons in the 2017 game 6  KD : the game 6 in the 2016 WCF  Westbrook : games 2 trough 4 in the Utah series in 2018  Kawhi : last year's series against Denver  PG : Game 6 against Utah in 2018  Dame : Jrue Holiday nothing else to say  CP3 : the end of the 2014 game 5 against OKC  Steph : the end of the game 7 in 2016  Kyrie : the end of the series vs the Bucks with Boston  Giannis : last year's vs Miami  Donovan Mitchell : the 2019 series vs the Rockets  Unless I forget someone, most guys either haven't played enough in the playoffs or aren't that relevant"
"There's nothing wrong with AD leaving the Pelicans, but he blatantly quit on them in the middle of the season. We've already reached the point where stars can demand a trade, to a specific team, with 2+ years left on their contract. Above all that, AD publicly asked out halfway through the season because he thought he was entitled to join LeBron at the deadline. When the trade fell through, he just stopped playing (It could've been the Pels' choice, but he forced their hand). That team had Jrue Holiday and Julius Randle. They weren't contenders, but AD could've tried to make a run and then just demanded a trade afterwards. He quit on them. And ""That's All, Folks"" was a giant middle finger to the fan base that he just quit on. And then he lied about the intentions behind the shirt!  I don't even care if Pelicans fans have beef with AD. I have beef with him on their behalf."
And Jrue Holiday!! Such a shame Boogie suffered that Achilles injury

Jrue Holiday
"I don't think one can blame Lillard for losing to the Warriors. The series that is much more damaging to his legacy is getting swept by AD's Pelicans. Iirc, Dame had a terrible time against Holiday. Jrue is an all-NBA defender but Dame was terrible that series. Jrue even went off for 40 in game 4."
"When it’s Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Trevor Ariza, Jrue Holiday, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and P.J. Tucker on the floor? You’re not gonna see many easy buckets."
Mines like this..   **West:**  1. Jazz in 5 (Memphis steals a game but this Jazz team is scary)  1. Dallas in 7 (I think Luka can do it. I want this upset to happen so bad.)  1. Blazers in 6 (Blazers pretty much full strength and Nuggets missing Murray hurts them a ton)  1. Lakers in 6 (Playoff Lebron)  **East:**  1. Sixers in 4 (unless Westbrook and Beal play godly every game I think sixers take this easy)  1. Knicks in 7 (hoping DRose makes a big impact. I miss Prime Drose man)  1. Bucks in 6 (Jrue Holiday makes a big difference on this bucks team)  1. Nets in 5 (Nets win 3 straight let off the gas and Tatum/Brown go off to steal 1)
The jrue holiday effect
Yeah but people find a way to shit on every NBA athlete eventually. Kawhi was one of the most hated players here during 2017-2018. And I’m sure Giannis will get his turn eventually.  Jrue Holiday is one of the nicest guys in the league and they still conjured up a reason for hating him this week.
Now Mavericks fans can know how Giannis felt before we got Jrue Holiday. Atleast luka can shoot from deep lol. Everyone looking like deer in headlights
The Jrue Holiday effect.  Same thing happened to the Blazers when Jrue was on the Pels.
He actually got blocked by Jrue Holiday but nice comment hater.
My point is pretty self explanatory. Bucks won this game because of Jrue Holiday.
"I'm pissed, what the hell kind of play was that, we are not getting a 2 pointer to tie the game with .5 sec, we need to go for the 3 at that point, that last play should have been for Duncan, and first off, why would jimmy come off of one screen, it's the nba, of course jrue Holiday is gonna get past it. What a choke, why the hell is jimmy on jrue Holiday when Middleton has the ball, two stupid decisions. I'm pissed, I get that their are the supposed to be better bc they are the higher seed, but it doesn't take a lot of brain power to know that Jimmy should be guarding The one bucks player who has been sinking his shots the whole game"
"Jrue Holiday is really a difference maker for the Bucks, his defensive effort is remarkable"
Bucks do not win this game without Jrue Holiday plain and simple. He just brings a different veteran energy that just wasn’t there with Bledsoe. Jrue could be the reason they get really far in these playoffs.
People talking about the 3s make sense   Bucks had 64 Rebounds. And Jrue Holiday had 11
Jrue Holiday is a winner. This guy is so much better than bledsoe.
Hot take: the Jrue Holiday trade was worth it.
Jrue Holiday is a massive upgrade to Bledsoe for the playoff
"Jrue ""THAT'S WHY THEY BROUGHT ME HERE"" Holiday"
This was a great game. Also Jrue Holiday is the key to the success of this team. He's light years ahead of Drew Bledsoe
Jrue holiday was such a good pickup
Jrue Holiday
JRUE MOTHERFUCKING HOLIDAY
"That's Jrue ""Ja Stopper"" Holiday coming up in the clutch right there"
Jrue Holiday is the difference
Jrue holiday is such a good defender.
JRUE HOLIDAY HAVE MY BABIES
Everyone made such a big deal about Jrue Holiday but dude has had a quiet game
Imagine Jrue Bledsoe being out there instead of Jrue Holiday
I will always be mad that the Pelicans gave up jrue holiday
Jrue Holiday trade is gonna look hilarious if the Bucks lose in the first round
Just wanna shout out 2 of the most underrated Jrue Holiday and Hubie Brown love them both
"Jrue Holiday a solid career. Like for a mid-level PG, he gets to play with the best PFs in AD and Giannis gets paid in MIL"
It’s time to begin a dialogue  Jrue Holiday is a top 5 point guard
JRUE MAXIMUS HOLIDAY
Jrue Holiday is the man
Jrue ‘big money’ holiday
Jrue Holiday is the toughest perimeter defender in the NBA
Underrating Jrue Holiday. He’s legit
"Not a huge Bucks follower, but am I correct in that Giannis hasn't changed his game significantly from last year (he'll hit a few threes for you, but he's not going to win a series torching you from outside), and the main difference between last year and this year is the addition of Jrue Holiday?  And, they're going to need more than 2-5 with four points if they're going to avoid the same fate as last year?"
If Giannis lose in the first round with jrue holiday oh boy. AD smiling
This captain obvious over here but Jrue Holiday is so much better than Bledsoe. I already miss the poor shooting and over aggressive defense
Jrue Holiday and Kyle Lowry should have more all-defensive team selections
can't wait for jrue holiday on a contender
"I think people are very aware of the fact that Jrue Holiday is markedly better than Bledsoe, especially as a shooter."
**Starters**  Steph Curry   Jrue Holiday   Justin Holiday   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Brook Lopez    **Bench**    LaMelo Ball   Marcus Morris   Seth Curry   Robin Lopez   Markieff Morris   Thanasis Antetokounmpo   Kostas Antetokounmpo    **Coaching staff**   Mike D'antoni   Dan D'antoni
"Jimmy and Bam are both better than last season, our defense is finally turning the corner into a cohesive unit and all of our shooters are hot at the perfect time.  The Bucks as a playoff team are significantly, significantly better than last year. Turning Eric Bledsoe into Jrue Holiday cannot be overstated. P.J. Tucker gives them lineup versatility.   Bucks starting five &gt; Heat starting five. Bucks sacrifice bench depth for that. They have to hope Forbes, Connaughton, Portis can give them decent minutes. If they don't, that's where the Heat win this series.  Bucks in 7."
Jrue Holiday is going to be the key.  Apart from his defense I really wonder who is going to try to guard him.  He could have a big impact offensively.
If only they could get someone like Jrue Holiday
1. CP3 2. Zion 3. LeBron 4. Jrue Holiday 5. Brandon Ingram 7. Shaq 8. Curry 9. KD 10. AD (When he leaves the Lakers)
"We have the best coach in the business in regards to stopping a particular player, which has often led to unusual suspects raining buckets on our heads. I am very worried about Jrue Holiday. That being said if Jimmy and Bam are getting calls they are undeniably putting up 50-60 combined every night. The other 50-60 points are gonna be interesting to see where they come from. Assuming Robinson and Herro are productive, I think we will need to see moderate contributions from Dragic, Nunn and Ariza in that order. We NEED them to play their best basketball to make it out of the east and if they do play as well as they can I like our matchups against pretty much everyone not named the Brooklyn nets. That will be a tough series. Would need a lot to go our way"
"Jrue Holiday was also very, very hurt most of the time - and AD never had the supporting cast in NO that Milwaukee has had the past 3 years."
Jrue Holiday is literally the number two on a contender today lmao. And he was better in NO than he is today
"Thank you, excellent point made that many people seem to miss. Was Jrue Holiday really good enough to be AD's number two? Rondo and Cousins was the best NO help he ever got, and like you said, KD Warriors."
Jrue Holiday is really fucking good. More than enough to be a competent #2 to a true #1 player to at least be a regular playoff team.  Their lack of playoff appearances (won't use playoff record cuz Warriors) is enough to argue against him being a Top 5 player.
"Last year they had Jrue Holiday, 2019-20 JJ Redick, and Derrick Favors  This year they had Eric Bledsoe, 2020-21 JJ Redick, and Steven Adams"
"The Lakers, Philadelphia and New York are the standouts to me. Philadelphia have a lot of great defensive personnel; and the Lakers and Knicks are coached really well defensively. Gobert and Embiid are great at rim protection. Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Thybulle, Caruso and Jrue Holiday are great on the perimeter. Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green and Giannis are great help defenders."
"How has SVG looked worse? The team traded Jrue Holiday, their roster is worse than last year, and won 1 more game."
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"Yeah, Milwaukee with PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday is a different team - better defense, better leadership, and better chemistry."
"The point was, his height isn’t uncommon for most guards right now. I forgot to mention Jrue holiday(6’3) and Mike Conley (6’1)"
"This season devolved for a myriad of reasons and I think this trade was part of it, but I think the Mavs overachieved last year to even make the playoffs and didn't get heaps better so it makes sense to me that they made the playoffs and saw an early exit. I believe my prediction to myself (and thus, my season expectation/hope) at the beginning of the season was a 6-seed and a first round exit, so they even outperformed that. Contextually, the only team above the Mavs in the West from last season that got visibly worse (to me) from last year were the Rockets (by a lot), Thunder (by a lot), and Clippers (by not so much and in fact this Clippers iteration may be more successful, who knows, NBA is weird) whereas teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Nuggets and Suns got objectively better/healthier.  Mavs didn't do very much to make a leap. It always felt like this was the last season of experimentation to me. Try some lineup/player type combinations and see what sticks. I think we learned a lot. DFS took a huge leap in the 2nd half of the season (but didn't really bring it consistently to the playoffs), it's unclear whether Maxi is finally regressing or just too beaten up to be usable, KP is probably not the second star/unicorn they wanted him to be due to injury or mental stuff, but more visibly, we carried 4 nearly unplayable rookies (I like Josh Green and want to see him develop, but I don't believe he's currently an NBA player) a super narrow Boban, and a Trey Burke all season. You just can't have 5-6 guys on an NBA roster who see  next to no minutes other than garbage time and expect to be a deep playoff contender, y'know? That's possibly a roster management issue and I think Donnie's seat is a little hot (and should be), but mostly it says to me that this team was not constructed with the goal of competing for a title and I think that's fine, not every team should be so long as there's a plan for the future (which I do think there is!).  I always believed that the roadmap looked something like this: Year 1 of Luka was just play with Dirk, have some fun, adjust to the speed of the NBA, get the torch passed, etc. Year 2 was letting Luka be the guy for better or for worse, put the offense in the hands of a kid who can't drink in the US yet and see what you have. Maybe get him a potential partner/2nd option if the deal is right and experiment with that. Probably won't make the playoffs, that's fine, who cares. Start collecting some expirings for the next season or two and point towards a FA year that you think could end up strong. Year 3 is the low playoff seed year (unless you use the offseason pre-Y3 to get a big splashy FA, Dallas didn't) and get some experience under the brightest lights. Year 4 is probably the FA target year. You get 1 more season before Luka's superduperubermax prevents you from affording much and requires strong drafting/scouting, so use it wisely. This FA class could've had Giannis (someone Donnie had been vocal about wanting to draft, but Cuban shut down because he wanted cap space for one last title run with Dirk), could still have Kawhi, Jrue Holiday, Oladipo, etc., that's a pretty reasonable FA class to target in on 2-3 years out. Year 4 would be the opening of the window and for as long as you have Luka + 2nd star, you'll be a top 4 seed in the West (provided no injuries or whatever)   I think the biggest deal people don't realize or sweep under the rug with Seth is that he has some red flags. He's nearly 31, wanted starter minutes (Philly did give him nearly 29 MPG this season compared to Dallas' 24.6 last year, which is effectively what Brunson played this year (25)), but has historically been a pretty underwhelming defender in addition to being a low volume shooter. He only averages about 5 3s attempted per game. He's a flashy scorer (and is a Curry) but he takes pretty ""safe"" shots. We have no idea what he looks like with a higher volume if he say, took THJ amounts of shots, because he's just never really done it for a whole season. His line looks a lot like Jalen and I think we'd just much rather have Jalen who is 6 years younger than Curry and still able to develop.  I also digress. Ultimately, I'm sad right now/today/this week, but I think the truth is the Mavs performed as-expected/as-hoped. There were a lot of downs this season (for us AND everyone else, COVID sucks) but some ups too. This offseason is going to impact the future of this franchise likely more than any offseason outside of 2019 and I have no reason to not be optimistic and will continue to be optimistic until proven otherwise and if that happens, we'll go from there I guess."
"Lol what? So your hypothetical scenario here is that Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton, competent NBA basketball players, shoot sub-35% TS for *a whole series*, and the Bucks can’t improve from that.  I would say there’s a very obvious way to improve from that, but go off."
"he's a taller jrue holiday without jrues shooting,  but he's stronger than holiday so he can defend more players"
"When Jrue Holiday is the first option, he gets asked to do the same thing. Only Holiday doesn’t get the respect of Kawhi."
"Cool ill just start calling Jrue ""Holiday Potter"""
sixers need their legend jrue holiday
"Teague has as many all star selections as Jrue Holiday, therefore Teague=Jrue"
"Man Bucks D coulda been better just was hitting shots. Killed em. major loss considering no James Harden and they pretty much quit w 4min left. Middleton &amp; Greek have step up challenge of guarding KD as Pelicans fan Jrue Holiday is always guarding people way bigger than him because he's so gifted on ball. But He can't be guarding Lebron, Joker, &amp; KD when you have guys that big and good on Defense. Khris, Greek, PJ, &amp; Lopez all should be able hold they own. Jrue if given Kyrie can keep him in check for 20-25pts."

"Giannis was tied with Jrue Holiday for most 3-point makes tonight, tf you talkin about lmfao  The Bucks just need to play Giannis more minutes, how tf does Budenholzer explain Kyrie playing almost 10mins more than Giannis in a playoff game."
"They could've faced the Nets in the ECF and gotten the Hawks in the 2nd round if they finished where Philly did, so you could consider it a failure that they find themselves in this position. Coming into the season everyone and their mama penciled the Nets in as a lock for a top 2 seed and the best team in the East, and the rest of the field was wide open.   Major contenders included the Bucks, Sixers, Celtics, Heat, and Raptors. Since the Bucks finished as the #1 seed the last 2 years and then added Jrue Holiday many believed they had the inside track for a top 2 seed, but Philly just had a much better season. So it's not bad luck that the Bucks aren't getting an easy 2nd round opponent, that's part of the reason why the season would be considered a failure if they fall short here."
"Lonzo is a 2, through and through. This is the Jrue Holiday situation all over again. A guy who is enormously better off the ball, a great secondary playmaker who can take over some ball handling duties but not run the entire offense while getting to focus more on the defensive end.   But everyone is still so stuck in those old school mindsets of “once a player plays a certain position they’re that position for life”."
"this bucks team is trash lol. dumbass coach, also dumbass players always making bone headed moves. the only semi-intelligent players on the bucks are jrue holiday and brook lopez. we kicked their ass without james harden lol imagine if harden didnt get injured this series would probably be 4-0"
Malachi Flynn &gt; Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday having a bad game jeez
milwaukee players got no iq lol. the only players on their team that ctually has half a brain is jrue holiday and brook lopez
Brynn Forbes: 0-4  Pat C. : 0-0  Bobby Portis: 0-1  Middleton: 0-3  PJ Tucker: 1-4  Giannis: 1-4  Jrue Holiday: 2-6  Lopez: 0-1  This game should be a blowout.
I saw one guy imply that jrue holiday isn’t a good defender because of the shamet dunk
"Kris ""who?"" Middleton and Jrue ""where?"" Holiday are letting down Giannis! Why sign that extension? He could have teamed up with Luka!"
Jrue Holiday looks like the Cheshire cat.
Jrue holiday and Khris Middleton are playing awful right now
Better player?  Jrue Holiday or Kyrie Irving?
Jrue Holiday is the philanthropist Kyrie thinks he is.
"Giannis is also a top 5 player and Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are both top 30 players imo, maybe one of them could even crack top 20. I'm rooting for the Nets cause I'm a Harden fan but it's gonna be reaalllyyyy tough for the Nets if Harden can't come back."
Jrue Holiday can’t shoot
All tapes and video footage of Jrue Holiday missing these rotations the past couple minutes must be burned immediately and never spoke of again
Ahahahahahaha  YOU THINK JRUE HOLIDAY DOESN'T POST SMALLER GUARDS????  OH MY GOD LMFAOOOOOO  SHAUN LIVINGSTON LITERALLY USED TO DO THAT SHIT CONSTANTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN THE PLAYOFFS FOR YOUR TEAM AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHABBAHAHBAHAHAHAHA
Jrue Holiday channeling Brick Anderson on that one.
How does Jrue Holiday miss 3 free throws?
JRUE HOLIDAY!?!?!
One of the matchups not being talked about is Jrue Holiday against Irving/Harden. Should be interesting to see how Holiday defends and how tight he plays them.
JRUE HOLIDAY SZN
Their names are Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday
ahahahha so true  (milwaukee loss)  \[serious\] is Jrue Holiday the most overpaid guy in the league?  Giannis didn't deserve the MVP or DPOY in retrospect  (nets loss)  Kyrie couldn't take coriolis effect into account lmao
"Dame low key gets no blame as a superstar. I love him but he got clamped by jrue holiday and swept back to back to back (17 first round, 18 first round, 19 wcf). He gets all the credit when they win cuz the blazers are trash and no blame when they lose because the blazers are trash"
Feels like the Blazers were TOO ISO heavy and dribble way too much. Dame also isn't an excellent facilitator (he's just great tho) and needs to have a playmaker take some of the scoring load while he comes off screens. LMA really could've grown to be that guy if he develops correctly in that system.  Defense was also pretty shoddy. Jrue Holiday could've been that guy.
&gt; I know this is a shitpost  It's really not though. Rondo and Jrue Holiday were the two best players on the Pelicans when they beat Portland. Rondo was better than AD in the Finals.
"I'm familiar with a Jrue Holiday, but not a Drue Holiday."
jrue holiday. knew nothing about the basketball side of our city. just knew there was a guy who shared the same name as drew. and i was given a bobble head of him. so i checked out the team and boom here i am a hardcore basketball and pelicans fan
Jrue Holiday
"Give me Jrue Holiday and Christian Wood. Jrue and Smart make for a disgusting defensive backcourt, and Wood gives us a versatile 4/5 who can shoot and grab rebounds."
Why on Earth is Jrue Holiday taking this many shots?!
Is Jrue Holiday actually Ben Simmons if Ben shot the ball?
How tf is jrue holiday 1-11??!!
Jrue Holiday playing worse than Aaron holiday
Jrue holiday is the most erratic offensive player I've ever seen
I can't describe the game of Jrue Holiday
Jrue Holiday 1/10 is offset by Booker 2/7 and Ayton 1/8
Jrue Holiday 1-10 FG. Bruh
If Scott Foster wasn’t reffing Jrue Holiday obviously would’ve remembered to actually get the ball into the net
Jrue Holiday?
"Mikal Bridges arrested, charged, booked, and cuffed Jrue Holiday his damn self"
This unironically   Y’all told everyone to shut up about the refs after game 1 lmfao and after the Booker no calls   But when it’s any different y’all posting that Jrue Holiday is a thug
Jrue Holiday is a brick machine
Jrue Holiday is actually left handed imho
Jrue Holiday with the sorriest ISO I've ever seen
There's the jrue holiday we know
How is Frank the Tank defending Jrue Holiday so well
Jrue Holiday 1/8 again.
*jrue holiday
Jrue Holiday is 1/8 and still has a +/- of +10 so far this game. Insane how valuable he is defensively to make up for his truly awful shooting these playoffs.
"that Game 5 Jrue Holiday game might be one of the greatest anomalies in Finals history, the variance between his offensive games swings so wildly, but its like twice as likely to be a 4-20 than 20+ pts on decent efficiency"
Jrue Holiday cannot make a layup
Looks like we are gonna get that version of Jrue Holiday tonight.
Jrue holiday about to cost the bucks a championship
Jrue holiday offensive disaster-class smh
