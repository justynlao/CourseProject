YIKES!  You are revealing too much about yourself here.   [Richard Sherman](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/richard-sherman-contract-case-for-hiring-an-agent/rnappi39ioby194g7jd456s1q) repped himself during his last contract and earned about half as much as he could have and didn't leverage himself a safety net.    At the bare minimum you need financial advisers to help make the most of your money and and prepare you for all of life's expenses.  I am making 1/4 of Yuta Watanabe' salary and I require a financial adviser.  You probably should have a financial adviser if you're making 1/10th of his salary.
"Yuta Watanabe made $321,893."
"Kostas took a draft spot away from a lot of guys way more talented &amp; proven than him solely off his last name.  To think Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Yuta Watanabe &amp; Jae'Sean Tate went Undrafted because of this dude.  Shows that scouts do not know as much as fans sometimes."
"Naomi (not Yuta) Watanabe is probably the biggest celebrity in Japan right now.  Ohtani had his fair share of advertising material, but Naomi was literally everywhere.  Just based on my observations in Japan circa 2019."
Japan have 2 NBA players in Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe.
"They made it as hosts, but they've gotten a bit better, too. Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe are solid, and former Nevada legend Nick Fazekas has played well for them in the past, too"
"Japan basketball has historically been pretty trash and honestly still doesn't really deserve a spot, but I'm pretty excited to see them this year. This is definitely the best Japanese basketball roster ever. Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe are genuinely GOOD NBA players who might be able to carry them past another Olympic squad a couple times.   And the top players (MVP level guys) from the Japanese league aren't TOTAL scrubs anymore. Makoto Hiejima, Yudai Baba, and Yuki Togashi have all spent time in either the NBA Summer League or G league. There are a couple other guys who look pretty decent too. Kosuke Kanamaru is an absolute sharpshooter, averaging over 40% from 3 and 90% from the free throw line in multiple seasons in Japan.   Japan is certainly nowhere near the European or American powerhouse countries. But I can see them getting a couple wins, especially against some of the weaker teams who have qualified for the Olympics, like Nigeria or Iran. As a Wizards fan, I hope Rui carries them far."
Yuta Watanabe on Anthony Edwards.  Blame the pandemic all you want but really that's what ended our season.
Okay but have you seen Yuta Watanabe on defense.
I wouldn't trade yuta watanabe for ben simmons hes actually a blackhole on offense
Raptors' top 15 players not in this postseason:  |1|Pascal Siakam| --:|:--| |2|Fred VanVleet| |3|Norman Powell| |4|Kyle Lowry| |5|OG Anunoby| |6|Chris Boucher| |7|Malachi Flynn| |8|Terence Davis| |9|Aron Baynes| |10|DeAndre' Bembry| |11|Freddie Gillespie| |12|Stanley Johnson| |13|Yuta Watanabe| |14|Paul Watson| |15|Matt Thomas|
Fair enough- I‚Äôm also a big Yuta Watanabe fan so was bummed to see him only get coverage for getting dunked on.
"Alternatively, ""Watanabe puts himself on the line to contest Edwards' tremendous dunk""  Credit is due to Yuta for contesting this sort of play 10/10 times. Takes a lot of courage to know you'll likely fail so publicly."
Yuta Watanabe
Stanley Johnson is a dangerously impoverished man's OG Anunoby  Yuta Watanabe is Juan Toscano-Anderson but converted to yen
"Without shoes:  Pascal is 6‚Äô8.25‚Äù, Chris Boucher is 6‚Äô8‚Äù, Khem Birch 6‚Äô7.5‚Äù, Scottie Barnes 6‚Äô7‚Äù, Freddie Gillespie 6‚Äô9‚Äù, Dalano Banton 6‚Äô7.75‚Äù, Precious Achiuwa 6‚Äô7.5‚Äù, Yuta Watanabe 6‚Äô8‚Äù, and Sam Dekker 6‚Äô7.75‚Äù. So most of these guys would end up being 6‚Äô9‚Äù in shoes, except Scottie Barnes, who‚Äôd be 6‚Äô8‚Äù in shoes, and Freddie Gillespie, who‚Äôd be 6‚Äô10‚Äù in shoes."
YUTA WATANABE ON MY WRIIII
"Scottie Barnes, Yuta Watanabe and Johnathan Kuminga."
Yuta Watanabe on my wrist
"YUTA WATANABE ON MY WRII-- Hol' up, wrong sub."
[$1.5 million if he doesn't get cut by opening night](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/toronto-raptors/yuta-watanabe-27713/)
You're right. They also beat the Yuta Watanabe Japan team and 41yo Luis Scola Argentina team. Absolute legends
"They will.   They‚Äôre rebuilding, Lowry is gone, Dragic probably ain‚Äôt staying soon, they‚Äôre looking to trade Siakam, so their best players are FVV (who can barely shoot over 40%), rookies, GTJ, OG, and Yuta Watanabe  That‚Äôs a bad team"
"Poor basketball development program compared to what is needed for the NBA, paired up with not so great genes.  East and South East Asian countries don't really create NBA level talent with their genes. Not unless they're mixed, thats why most of the top talents who has an ancestry from these parts are mostly mixed (eg, Clarkson, Hachimura, Jalen Green, etc), the only exception is Yuta Watanabe but he really isn't performing that well in the NBA."
YUTA WATANABE ON MY WRIST
like a less handsome yuta watanabe
My boyfriend looks like Yuta Watanabe. I hit the lottery!
Vlatko Cancar vs Yuta Watanabe
Yuta Watanabe hard carrying for GW right now
Except he was actually pretty bad..  8/21 with 2 rebounds. Yuta Watanabe was their best player
Ricky was next level good in this game. Yuta Watanabe filled the sheet with 19/8/3 and 5 stls. Rui looked very passive
"Rui is the closest they have to that now. He is a super star in Japan, him and Yuta Watanabe."
Yuta Watanabe
Yuta Watanabe baby
I would accept SGA for Yuta Watanabe. Being a GM is so easy!
Brandon Knight walked so Yuta Watanabe could run.
"Recency bias, but Anthony Edwards on Yuta Watanabe is probably the grossest mid-dunk photo of all time.  This one looks better in real-time though I think."
This person got it wrong also. Yuta Watanabe.
"Yuta Watanabe, I‚Äôm prepared for all the Anthony Edwards comments"
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"Honestly our full squad is nothing but sick names. Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Pascal Siakam, Freddy Vanvleet, OG Anuonoby, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Nick Nurse, Yuta Watanabe, Delano Blanton, Goran Dragic. even Scottie Barnes is kinda cool  Definitely top 5 team based purely on cool/unique names"
"&gt; OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher and Yuta Watanabe  That‚Äôs not really a logjam. For one, Yuta and OG could play the 2 and have at times last season. Another thing to mention is that the front court has 3 slots while the backcourt has 2. Starting OG/Siakam/Birch then having Barnes/Boucher/Achiuwa off the bench is perfectly fine. I could see Nurse cycling in Yuta to be a positional filler in case someone goes down."
Yuta watanabe sends his regards
Does Yuta Watanabe still play for them?
Yuta Watanabe!
"Just wait til our best player gets back, Yuta Watanabe"
*Yuta Watanabe shivers*
"Dragic isn't under contract for next season, so he's already not being included in that group. Same for Boucher. You need to look at the salaries for 2022-23, that's what would count for trying to open up a max slot for Ayton.   Siakam, FVV, OG, Barnes and Precious is $84 million if the Raptors get rid of literally everyone else in salary dumps or just waiving them (which would include Gary Trent Jr., Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, etc). That $84 million leaves $35 million under a $119 million cap, but then you have to include about $7 million for cap holds for empty roster spots, which brings that down to $28 million. Ayton's max would start at $30 million, as it would be 25% of the $119 million cap."
"Some often-forgotten bench players have incredible skin. Ex. Yuta Watanabe, all the Holiday Brothers"
"Maybe Yuta Watanabe when he was with the Grizzlies, pretty sure he's bigger than Rui over in Japan (can't confirm that tho) prolly a lot of jersey sales in over there."
there are 10 minute highlight videos of yuta watanabe scoring 2 points with 3 rebounds so this tame
"Yuta Watanabe is a decent 3p shooter. He hit over 40% last year. If he can be more aggressive and cut more to the basket too, you have an amazing role player off the bench."
"And the 14th dude in your rotation kinda needs to be a great guy who's well liked, like a Yuta Watanabe type or a player coach like Haslem.  He just seems like a dork."
"I haven't been able to get odds, but judging by perhaps an increased opportunity from a strong training camp, I would guess Yuta Watanabe to have solid long shot potential for MIP"
Yuta Watanabe
They're solid but have you watched Yuta Watanabe recently?
Yuta Watanabe has been on Twitter since 2012 though ü§î
Yuta Watanabe
*Yuta Watanabe has entered the chat*
Except Yuta Watanabe
Boucher is one of those guys whose stats make him look better than he actually is I reckon. I feel like Yuta Watanabe is actually a more impactful player than Boucher is

Trying to cover up the murder of Yuta Watanabe
They talk about him like he's Yuta Watanabe
Yo what about an all Asian team  Rui Hachimura Yuta Watanabe Kyle Anderson Jordan Clarkson Jeremy Lin
https://youtu.be/M5qczHNh7I0  yuta watanabe   the one with many friends
Yuta Watanabe
Not as bad as when Raptors fans whined endlessly about that Yuta Watanabe poster lol
That is an unnecessarily crooked and hostile interpretation. You can't tell black people apart if you point out that 2 people - out of a league that's predominantly black - have had similar roles and gone through somewhat close circumstances?  Perhaps if someone said that Jeremy Lin and Yuta watanabe looked the same your view wouldn't be reaching hard.
"Raptors would protect: Van Vleet, Anunoby, Trent Jr. Flynn, Siakam, Boucher, this years first round pick, Jalen Harris.   Most likely to be picked: Khem Birch, Aaron Baynes, Yuta Watanabe"
Yuta Watanabe of Toronto. Next draft we're gonna have another half Filipino in Jalen Green and probably Kai Sotto next. I don't really know anyone else.
Lol let's be honest here if Trae Young was white he would get a lot more respect in r/NBA. The subs demographic is mostly white/Asian that's why we get spammed with Yuta Watanabe and Luka Doncic posts all season
Yuta Tabuse &gt; Barbosa &gt; Avery Bradley &gt; Yuta Watanabe
Only 2 degrees of separation between Yuta Watanabe and Isiah Thomas
Would rather watch one about Yuta Watanabe tbh.
How dare you disregard the great Yuta Watanabe
"Visit Dongbei real quick and everybody there is 6'4 easily. Chinese people not making the NBA is for a geopolitical reason only. Why pull in better players like Guo Ailun or Ding YangYuHang when you have Yuta Watanabe? It's just political. Why develop Zhou Qi when you could develop Aleksej Poku? Why develop WangZheLin when you could develop Rui Hachimura? Why spend money and marketing having a Chinese face on your american team when the system is currently trying to push yellow peril ? Why develop Abadushalmu Abudurexiti when you could have Deni Avdija? There are CBA young studs like Kevin Zhang and Fanbo Zeng that could make it here too.   What do i mean political? The idea is that making the NBA is also part luck. With 30 teams, 13 roster slots, you can only put so many people on your team. You have to give somebody a chance, bc one roster spot has 1000 hopeful people trying to get on. Not only are you vying for that super competitive spot, if you also come from the country that they don't really like and have beef with, they're not gonna ""help you out"" and give you that opportunity."
Yuta Watanabe
"Lakers, Warriors and Bulls. (In no specific order)  Lakers are popular worldwide, Warriors have Curry and Bulls had Jordan.   Outside of Canada, Raptors don‚Äôt have much in the way of international fans.  Raptors and Wizards have fans in Japan thanks to Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe, but basketball doesn‚Äôt have the same level of popularity there as it does in some other countries. (I.e, China)  Can‚Äôt really speak for the other listed teams."
especially if this coincides with us landing Yuta Watanabe
"&gt; Explains why Yuta Watanabe has the top selling jersey in Japan when Rui is infinitely more talented (no offense to Yuta)  Racism is definitely rampant in Japan, but I wouldn't say this is the reason why Yuta's jersey is selling more. Rui's was the highest selling last year if I remember correctly. The only reason why I'd say Yuta's sales have gone up is because he's having a bit of a ""breakout"" season. I'm also gonna assume a large majority of Japanese NBA fans probably already have a Rui jersey."
A friend of mine told me Yuta Watanabe was more popular in Japan than Rui Hachimura because he's considered to be real Japanese. Even though Rui is a better player.
"Some racist shit. Explains why Yuta Watanabe has the top selling jersey in Japan when Rui is infinitely more talented (no offense to Yuta)  [The online Japanese community also cyberbullied a famous Wrestler into committing suicide because of how she was playing a character on a ""reality show""](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/asia/hana-kimura-death-terrace-house-intl-hnk-scli/index.html)"

Yuta Watanabe
"This is how bad he is.  This lineup:  Fred VanVleet, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, Chris Boucher, Khem Birch  Is better than this lineup:  Fred Vanvleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Baynes.  Khem Birch is such an upgrade that him plus G-Leaguers is better than 2 all-stars and OG."
Yuta Watanabe is my favorite current random player in the NBA. Just a super solid NBA player. Does everything you want him to do for the most part.
"""The Raptors have announced that they have waived Paul Watson and Yuta Watanabe for screwing with the tank, and have signed Moritz Wagner in their place"""

# YUTA 'BOBBY WEBSTER'S SON' WATANABE. This kid gonna get paid!!!
Petition to turn the dunk contest into having the best dunkers just see who posterizes randomly chosen NBA players (Yuta Watanabe I‚Äôm looking at you) and give them a score based off the poster.
"Even before he was drafted, the big question was: ""He's fast enough, strong enough, and twitchy enough to get any bucket he wants at will, but will that translate to recklessness or endless buckets?  That being said, I hate how the Timberwolves offense is fucking STUPID for embracing too much of a trigger happy mindset (Ricky rubio, culver, AND naz reid ALL HAVE GREEN LIGHTS TO CHUCK 3'S?? SERIOUSLY?). In turn, Ant has spent too many games taking 3's and buying into an outside-inside approach. It's obvious from his baptism of yuta watanabe that his biggest strength has always been his quick twitch, ultra attacking versatile playstyle, but it sucks that he's been kind of slow to embrace  an inside to outside approach.  Im a Laker fan tho, so I dont watch too many Timberwolves games so I hesitantly argue that I think the more 3's he trades in for drives to the rim, the better ALL his percentages will be."
bro Yuta Watanabe is not LeBron James. plus LeBron was in much better position on that play
That is very heightist of you. We shouldn't expect Yuta Watanabe to be able to block a professional dunker just because he has 4 inches on him.
Yuta Watanabe. RESPECT.
"lol the point is that you shouldnt go for every single contest at the rim. for example, if ur ron baker on AD, or if ur a late arriving yuta watanabe on anthony edwards. its not always about who can get more vertical in a vacuum, if a dude like edwards is already in the air, contesting is just going to give him a free throw and a poster"
"Also Yuta Watanabe on Edwards' dunk:  ""Mans got a concrete taint"""
"it‚Äôs a different situation when you‚Äôre an actual shot blocker like bam and not Yuta Watanabe lol. mad respect, but he had no chance"
"His fans in Japan. When he was with the Grizzlies, the Grizzlies were third in merchandise sells, because of their Japanese fans base.   https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2019/05/02/yuta-watanabe-japananse-nba-fans-into-memphis-grizzlies-fans/3395964002/"
"Because the video title starts with ""Yuta Watanabe Good Looking"". That plus the thumbnail is what made people click on it."
Shoutout to Yuta Watanabe
"Well, it‚Äôs kind of fair to be critical of the Bucks organization, but that‚Äôs different that what you were talking about above. The OP is proof that everyone gets clowned on for getting dunked on, even a relatively lowly player like Yuta. I don‚Äôt think anyone can seriously claim this subreddit is generally hostile to fucking Yuta Watanabe lol"
"I'm not sugar coating anything.  You make a great point about Bembry having to help Yuta on the back cut, and an argument could be made over if Bembry needed to be as deep as the split line or stay on the low block to help.   Either way, Bembry played for the steal instead of a proper close out (not entirely his fault, he saw Watanabe there on his help side). Baynes staying in no mans land instead of rotating after the switch on the pick and pop was the main reason this play happened."
"I do have a question to ask ""did Anthony Edwards suck the gravity right out of the building when he dunk on Yuta Watanabe?"""
"So now it's just a lapse in judgement, that he should of just fouled Edwards. Also I don't see anyone clowning the Cavs defense for letting Murray get 50 without getting fouled, shooting an ungodly percentage.  But also 2 of watanabe teammates also failed in that category. The guy guarding Edwards shouldnt have gone for the steal resulting in his man having a full lane to dunk the shit out of the ball. Baynes the center lost his man on a switch and didn't pick up Edwards as was running down the lane. It was a team effort that lead to this poster.  I don't about defending white or Asian players, it might hype Asian and white players more, but no major defense if any. I don't know where you are seeing that. There's a very small minory of post defending yuta here or anywhere. Shit if anything asians and white player get kicked down lot more when they're down in this place."

I started covering Yuta Watanabe before his Freshman year at GW. I put together a fun podcast about him a long time ago that y'all might find interesting. [https://soundcloud.com/themikeoshow/the-chosen-one-yuta-watanabe](https://soundcloud.com/themikeoshow/the-chosen-one-yuta-watanabe)

0% chance Shaq knows who Yuta Watanabe is.  He just found out who Christian Wood is like a week ago.
Gonna go down some more for this week due to Aaron Gordon being injured and Nikola Vucevic just got denied at the rim by Yuta Watanabe.
Be who Yuta Watanabe.

Pleasant: Chris Boucher/Stanley Johnson/Yuta Watanabe - only mentioning one would be a disservice to the rest  Unpleasant: Terence Davis
"Yuta ""Captain"" Watanabe"
"""Yuta best! I Watanabe as good as you one day."""
"Dude, stop reaching it's a box out . Not even a particularly hard one.   Yuta Watanabe actually hits Lowry with the same force in the clip you sent lol. I guess Yuta was trying to injure Lowry too."
Today I learned that Ive been pronouncing Yuta Watanabe wrong
"There are a lot of names that are difficult to spell, so I‚Äôll give the commenters the benefit of the doubt. But when it is something as easy as, say, Yuta Watanabe‚Äôs name. It‚Äôs spelled WatanAbe, not Watanbe. C‚Äômon. Add one letter and you sound smarter in seconds."
My man Wheeler YUTA Watanabe
Yuta Watanabe is having quite a week.
"I'm a simple man. I see Yuta Watanabe on r/nba, I upvote."
"Who is Watanabe Yuta? For the blind, he is court vision. For the hungry, he is ramen. For the injured, he is the replacement small/power forward. For the sad, he is a bright spot on a struggling roster. For the fans, he is inspiration; for the board men, he gets paid 1.5 mil."
Norman Powell setting up Yuta Watanabe... this team is something else üòÇ
Do not sleep on my guy Yuta Watanabe!!
"I don't really remember IT having a reputation as a bad teammate. For the wizards it doesn't make a lot of sense, but for a team like the Cavs with multiple young guards, the value he could bring just as being a mature player, lesson about guarding against injury, hard worker, etc. is not quantifiable but probably more impactful than say, Yuta Watanabe is on the raptors. And I love Yuta."
Yuta Watanabe
I think there's only 2 Japanese players currently in the NBA:  1. Yuta Watanabe - Toronto Raptors  1. Rui Hachimura - Washington Wizards   I *think* those are also the only 2 Asian players.
Our C rotation is chris boucher/Yuta Watanabe  Our guards are ballers tho we‚Äôre about to bounce back i think
you think my man Yuta Watanabe is not putting up a fight? The mavs are out here with 2 lottery players losing to the Bulls come on now dont compare our situations

"Steven Adams (Polynesian/White), Yuta Watanabe, Jeremy Lin, both Lopez's off the top of my head"
"Its super weird to me how casual xenophobia still is. These are jokes where the punch line is essentially ‚Äúlol he‚Äôs not from here‚Äù.   I don‚Äôt think its exactly the same in terms of meaning (relating to bigotry/oppression) given the context of North America but the joke itself is like if they ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù kept calling Yuta Watanabe some chinese name or butchering Embiid‚Äôs name with click sounds or some shit like that.   Its tough as hell being an immigrant, despite your class or race. Constantly feeling like you don‚Äôt belong, and even when you‚Äôre damn near an MVP everybody still wants to remind you that you still might not fully belong.   Not trying to take it too seriously because it is Inside the NBA and Shaq is a clown but it is a little bit jarring when you think about what the actual punch line is and how unfunny it is."
"Imma keep it 100, I didn't expect anything from Yuta, just saw him as a body in practice and someone who will play garbage time minutes for us. But I have been very very very surprised with what he has given us on the court especially defensively. He just has this little knack for just randomly but not randomly having his hands in the passing lanes and just near where players will try to gather the ball, which makes up for him playing as a really undersized 5 at times. Even the mistakes he does make (such as missing a help rotation on PJ Washington tonight) are just relatively minor things that can be ironed out as he gets more accustomed to the tik and toks of Nurse's defense. Boucher-Watanabe might just end up becoming the new Jak and Skills for me."
"Hol up, I thought Yuta Watanabe was a forward? Dude is playing center now tf?"
"He's too slight to play center, which is why he plays the 4. Almost exclusively shares the floor with a 5 (right now that's Yuta Watanabe)."
"Yuta Watanabe, Tatum, and Ben Simmons"
He's looked interesting as a small ball 5 for a few mins.  We have a glut of guards/wings but no bigs. Yuta Watanabe is a star for us rn.
I mean that's a steal if we're keeping Yuta Watanabe.
"Yuta ""Despite the loss"" Watanabe"

"The last minute of this game is the only basketball I've ever seen, is Yuta Watanabe the best defender of all time?"

"That‚Äôs disrespectful to my man Yuta Watanabe, who wasn‚Äôt even on the team last year."
Didn't think the Raps were gonna actually tie it but I thought it was funny to see Tatum and Brown get put back in to guard Malachi Flynn and Yuta Watanabe
Yuta Watanabe deserves more playing time
