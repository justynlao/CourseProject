Scottie Lewis will be a 2nd round steal mark my words
"*OT sorta about ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES (1992), the very first game with official NBA and NBPA licenses*:  I recently found out that I have a copy of ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES *and* a working NES (*don't ask how I just figured this out*), so I gotta talk about this game. I don't want to discuss its gameplay because you already know it sucks. Rather I'd like to talk about the details it includes for the players (*nope, not graphically, because those are pretty generic*), chiefly their abilities. Each player's profile page ([MJ's profile as an example](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/images/22)) includes their FG%, FT%, 3FG%, and then 6 abilities: Running Speed, Jumping, Stealing, Blocking, Shooting Range, and Stamina. Those shooting percentages are from the 1990-91 season, and the rosters reflect the 1991-92 season. OK, you got the basics; time to look at this game's choices with player abilities.  * First, here is [a detailed scan of the game's front and back cover](https://www.covercentury.com/covers/nes/t/nes_tecmonbabasketball.jpg). Again, this is the first game ever with licenses from both the NBA and NBPA, so it can use all the real teams and players. It can put anyone it wants on the cover -- It was early-1992, so probably Michael Jordan, or Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird, or David Robinson. Look closely at the main player making the play on the cover -- that's Clipper **Loy Vaugt**. The Clippers weren't good in '91, weren't supposed to be good in '92, Vaught was a rookie of no note in '91 (*5.5 ppg, #13 pick in '90 draft*) .... I can't figure out the choice that was made here.  * Speaking of the timing of this game's release - it came out with rosters set for the 1991-92 season, including mega-star **Magic Johnson** on the Lakers. Except Magic retired in November of 1991 and never played for the '92 team. Oh well.   * **RUNNING SPEED:** The game shows you a bar graph for each player's ability, but over the years people have gone into the code and pulled out the specific number that Tecmo assigned to players' ratings ([all player ratings in the game are at this link](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/faqs/50445) - *scroll way down*). Ratings are out of 100, but few speeds topped 80; somehow Jeff Ruland and Magic Johnson both had an 80 speed. Ruland is a particularly egregious selection for this fast speed since he was just coming out of 4-year retirement at that point due to massive foot troubles. The fastest players in the game, with Speeds above 80, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90), Charles Barkley (90), **3)** Tim Hardaway (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), and **5)** Orlando Woolridge (81). Barkley, huh? For that matter, MJ also has no business with the best speed in the game.  * **JUMPING:** The best jumpers/leapers in the game, with Jumping above 70, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (80), Manute Bol (80), **3)** Dennis Rodman (78), Orlando Woolridge (78), **5)** Clyde Drexler (75), David Robinson (75), Hakeem Olajuwon (75), Scottie Pippen (75), Patrick Ewing (75), **10)** Elden Campbell (74), and **11)** Otis Thorpe (72). As you can see, this category sort of stands in for ""reach"" for tall centers who get lots of blocks.  * **Best Overall Athletes** in the game based on Running Speed &amp; Jumping (RS/J) are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90/80), **2)** Orlando Woolridge (81/78), **3)** Dennis Rodman (80/78), **4)** Scottie Pippen (80/75), **5)** Shawn Kemp (80/70), David Benoit (80/70), and **7)** Larry Johnson (75/70).   * **STEALING:** The best at stealing in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** Kevin Johnson (65), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (65), Michael Jordan (65), Scottie Pippen (65), Maurice Cheeks (65), Terry Porter (65), John Stockton (65), Mark Price (65), Greg Anthony (65), Michael Adams (65), **11)** Isiah Thomas (63). I'll point out that **Gary Payton** only had a rating of 45, which is oddly low, even based on the circumstances. He had just completed his rookie season in 1990-91, and his 2.0 spg were 12th best in the league despite only playing 27 mpg (*his Steal% was 5th-best in the NBA*). He had been the Pac-10 Defensive POTY and had a ridiculous amount of steals in college (*#2 in NCAA career all-time at that point*). There was both his college reputation &amp; proof as an NBA rookie that the guy was a big-time ball theft, so I'm unsure why they kept his Stealing rating as low as they did going into his 2nd season. Weirder yet, Greg Anthony graduated in '91 right before the game was developed with nearly the same amount of college steals as Payton (329 vs 321), but had no NBA success yet since he hadn't played yet, but he got the great rating (65) and Payton didn't (45).   * **BLOCKING:** The best at blocking in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** David Robinson (90), **2)** Hakeem Olajuwon (80), **3)** Manute Bol (75), **4)** Elden Campbell (72), **5)** Rik Smits (70), John Salley (70), Chris Dudley (70), **8)** Larry Nance (65), Mark Eaton (65), **10)** Alton Lister (62)  * **Best Overall Defensive Abilities** in the game based on having 40+ in Stealing &amp; Blocking (S/B) are: **1)** John Salley (40/70), **2)** Scottie Pippen (65/40), Shawn Kemp (45/60), **4)** Larry Johnson (50/50), Chris Gatling (45/55), **6)** A.C. Green (53/43), **7)** Reggie Lewis (50/40), Billy Owens (45/45), **9)** Tim Perry (40/45), Jerome Kersey (45/40), **11)** Tyrone Hill (40/40), David Benoit (40/40)  * **SHOOTING DISTANCE:** This isn't 3-point ability, as that's measured by 3FG%, but I think this affects how consistent a player is at hitting that 3FG% ... something like that. There are a bunch of guys with a 100 in this category, mostly 3-point specialists who it makes sense to give that top score to: Dell Curry, Reggie Miller, Craig Hodges, Dale Ellis, Glen Rice, and even Larry Bird (*plus others*). But for some reason they simply decided to give a 100 shooting distance ability to Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, as well. I guess they just wanted to game their own game however they needed to to make sure the 2 biggest superstars ended up putting up superstar stats no matter what.   * **STAMINA:** If a guard played almost every game, they probably got an 80+ stamina. Players with a stamina above 80 are: **1)** Michael Adams (90), Kevin Johnson (90), Tim Hardaway (90), John Stockton (90), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (90), **6)** Spud Webb (85), Terry Porter (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), **9)** Sarunas Marciulionis (83), **10)** Gary Grant (81). This last one is an obvious error since Grant had played in only 65 and 44 games over the prior 2 seasons.  * **David Benoit:** You might have noticed that David Benoit is among the best athletes &amp; best overall defensive abilities. I'm as confused as you are -- sure he was a good athlete (*was in the '93 dunk contest*), but he was also an unheralded rookie in the 1991-92 season, meaning he never even played in the NBA before this game came out. He went undrafted in 1990, played in Spain for a year, then joined the Jazz. He was a decent-not-great player at Alabama at the same time as Robert Horry, but nothing he did there (*including his defensive stats*) leads anyone to believe the abilities given to him make any sense."
"I don't believe Scottie Lewis could drop 90 in an NCAA game, since he averaged 8 ppg in the NCAA last year."

yea.. scottie lewis
"He was like, wait a minute, I am Scottie Lewis!"
Scottie Lewis is on his way to Shanghai as we speak
"The Raptors went on to win by a final score of 80-79...   I actually feel so bad for Scottie Lewis, but hey someone had to post it. Major brain fart, happens to the best of us."
"Scottie ""Solo"" Lewis"
"Scottie Lewis was a top recruit since like middle school teaming up with his boy Bryan Antoine and I always thought he's one of the most physically and athletically similar to MJ in terms of being 6'5-6'6 like Jordan 6'11 wingspan with big hands, high calf inserts for springy bounciness, and just gliding effortlessly around.  Of course in terms of actual skill and mentality he just has not put it together at all and was a huge disappointment even at Florida the only reason he prolly got drafted is the potential based on the aforementioned traits."

Scottie Lewis
"If you listened to the pod, he's saying if that draft was drafted now, based on what they did in college. They mentioned that Scottie was seen as a reach even then, so in today's game without a jump shot they might not draft him as high. So not exactly a retroactive redraft  That being said I think KJ goes earlier. Reggie Lewis goes way higher. Mugsy falls to the second round."
"Kenny is probably drafted ~10th in a real redraft behind Robinson, Pippen, Miller, Mark Jackson, Kevin Johnson, Horace Grant, Derrick McKey, Muggsy Bogues and Reggie Lewis, roughly in that order.   Psh, 3rd before Scottie is laughably idiotic lmao."
"Scottie Lewis on the Hornets is also a guy who could pull it off, he’s not that great of a player though."
"Probably an end of bench guy on the Hornets at best, but it’s really up in the air at this point. He’s barely getting played in the g-league, and I have no clue why, we lose nothing really by playing him. We’re starting and giving big minutes to underperforming guards, Scottie Lewis and DJ Carton come to mind, while he’s riding the bench while being the much more efficient player, with a better dRtg as well."
"\- What if Terell Branfdon, Shawn Kemp and Vin Baker never were traded for each other?  \- What if the league did a better job with Reggie Lewis?  \- What if Len Bias didn't celebrate like he did?  \- What if Lionell Simmons' development didn't stop after his sophomore year?  \- What if Anthony Randolph had returned to the NBA after developing in Europe?  \- What if Eddie Griffin had the mind of Shane Battier?  \- What if Danny Manning and Brad Daugherty never got injured?  \- What if the Sonics didn't trade #5 (Scottie Pippen) to the Bulls for Olden Polynice?  \- What if Duncan indeed signed with the Magic and joined Hill and TMac?  \- What if O'Neal and Hardaway were more mature when they played together?  \- What if the Sonics didn't give Jim Fucking McIlvaine that contract and instead just re-worked Kemp's contract?"
