How about Sasha Vujacic and Goran Dragic?
"Of course, but there are magnitudes of no calls, and certain players receive mroe no calls than others and vice versa. I agree, I don't think it's intentional, but it persists. We have stats to prove it too. Look at Jeremy Lin, Goran Dragic, or Shaq, or LeBron, all receive a higher percentage of no calls than say Jimmy Butler or James Harden etc...   Just because other players don't receive calls too, doesn't mean Luka or LeBron etc... wasn't hit on a call. He has a right to be pissed, but do it at a deadball, not while the other team is looking to score."
Goran Dragic has an all around game that gets sweeter over time too.  Not only does he not have a high ceiling— he’s a fraud. After we drafted him he said “I can go right at will” and that was disproven as soon as we saw him hit the court.
"I agree, people ITT saying Russ dunked with more power.. I disagree, he just let you know about more.   That dunk over Goran Dragic is I think the best dunk all time by a smaller guard"
Idk Goran Dragic probably has something to say about that
Goran Dragic can definitely play at the same level as he did in the bubble.
"Uh Giannis isn’t bad in the playoffs. Career 25 ppg even though he was shit to start his career, and he the only reason Goran Dragic/Tyler Herro/Duncan Robinson/Jae Crowder were killing us rather than Bam or Jimmy on defense."
Cavs fans probably think Sexton's better than Goran Dragic lmao
"huh  \&gt;Kyle Lowry is a free agent but will likely get a bigger deal, Mike Conley is too old, Goran Dragic is too old and Spencer Dinwiddie will be coming off of an ACL injury. For the price that Lonzo would cost, it is clear that he would be the best option for the Los Angeles Lakers."
yes Monte Morris and Goran Dragic basically the same player
did you just insinuate Goran Dragic is dead weight?  lmao bro you need to relax  edit: also no team has suffered from covid and injuries worse than the Heat  Mavs at least have had their best player and have a bunch of depth
Meanwhile the varsity team of LA is taking care of business without their two best players against the team JV LA needed 6 games to take down in the Finals without Goran Dragic  Levels
"Injury Report before anyone asks ""Why are the Heat 6-12?"" tomorrow:  \- Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic, Avery Bradley, Andre Iguodala, Meyers Leonard, Maurice Harkless, Chris Silva all OUT"
Ben Simmons =/= Goran Dragic
"&gt; Yeah, this post is ridiculous.  Nah u/mikeydale007 is right. This is too big of a hole to dig out of. The Heat are SO screwed.   Heat never should've traded this pick for Goran Dragic, who clearly hasn't contributed to the Heat at all. Yeah I know what you are gonna say...he's a leader of the Heat and he was arguably the Heat's best player for Rounds 1, 2, and 3 in the 2020 playoffs. But what happened in the Finals? He got injured and couldn't even play!  The Heat's 2021 first round draft pick, on the other hand, is guaranteed to be the next superstar.  Heat also won't be able to get out of the contracts of Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside, and James Johnson. Those are untradeable contracts. Also, Winslow can't make it on the court at all. That's their youth movement? Get real.   And don't give me none of this ""Yeah but their best players have all missed tons of games due to covid protocols."" Just don't give me none of that because I don't have a good response to it."
Goran Dragic is another member of this club
"Goran Dragic was 26 years old, All-Star, MIP and third team All-NBA and still not a star."
"&gt;In 2015 the Heat traded their 2021 first round pick to the Suns for Goran Dragic.  Still was a great trade. Dragic will 95% chance be better than whoever the pick ends up being.   I am slightly worried, but the Heat have not been healthy all season. They need to get a streak in soon, but it is still early in an odd East."
"&gt;The 6-11 Miami Heat don't own their own draft pick. It belongs to...the OKC Thunder, unprotected of course.  &gt;In 2015 the Heat traded their 2021 first round pick to the Suns for Goran Dragic.  &gt;The Suns traded this pick to the Sixers in 2018 to move up and take Mikal Bridges.  &gt;The Sixers traded it to the Clippers in the Tobias Harris trade.  &gt;And then the Clippers traded it to the Thunder for Paul George.  &gt;With the team ravaged by Covid, the team has dug themselves into a hole that will be difficult to recover from, and Sam Presti is rubbing his hands together.    Commenting to come back to this when the playoffs start. Say hi everyone"
"Here's a fun one:  **Steve Nash**/Goran Dragic  **Raja Bell**/Leandro Barbosa  **Grant Hill**/Jason Richardson/Matt Barnes  **Amare Stoudemire**/Boris Diaw  **Shaquille O'Neal**/Robin Lopez  Not the greatest, but a really cool squad"
"Yeah Thies is a low key beast, but he makes 0 noise in terms of media so nobody talks about that. Another interesting case, apart from big names, is Goran Dragic. In first year in nba was pretty raw in terms of decisions. Year after year had developed in a such unique solid player, who mastered 3/4 plays outstanding, in terms of comprehension of the game. It's an enormous shame he couldn't compete in the last Finals bc he would have been huge (aside that game straight from injury). I truly never followed him well since Slovenia title in 2018, immediately impressed by his game. Valaciunas is another one, 10+ years in nba just posting up and defense. He evolved e nice shot and his still there since i believe 2008. Vucevic is godmode on offense since 3 years. European players with immediate nba experience grow up solid rotational player for long time also. Don't forget Kobe apprehended all he could here in Italy in Reggio Calabria (toughhhh place bro, mafia filled)"
"""This team is like Goran Dragic, just putting on its shoes""   that is a great line"
Where’s Goran Dragic at?
"Goran Dragic didn't average a 20 PPG season until he was 27 years old. His first all star game was at 31 years old. From age 21-26 he averaged 9 PPG, from age 27-33 he's averaged over 17 PPG."
"loved watching Rockets Legend Clint Capela play alongside Rockets Legend Kyle Lowry, Rockets Legend Carmelo Anthony, and Rockets Legend Goran Dragic"
The worst part is that the Slovenian Luka stans want us to like the Miami Heat because Goran Dragic plays there. Over my dead body.
"If they can just get Goran ""Dragon Dance"" Dragic then they sweeping the league"
Don’t be offended. I think he’s just saying as Draymond ages he might play a more Dragic like role; Goran does with us. Stabilize the bench with his starter level of play for a few minutes less each night (save em for the playoffs.) he will still close games out and play half or more of his minutes w the starters. Just to prob start again for the playoffs. Again what we did w Dragic last year. Really seems to help save energy for the playoffs
"Dame himself said his “welcome to the NBA moment” came as a rookie at the hands of Goran Dragic in a preseason game. This wasn’t All-NBA Dragic either, this was first full season as a starter where he averaged like 14 &amp; 7. Can’t remember Dame’s exact words, but he was saying that Dragic could just get to any spot he wanted and there was nothing Dame could do, and that it left him wondering what the star level players could do if this is what your average starting level PG was like."
"&gt;“Well, he’s been effectively our point guard all year long,” Spoelstra said ahead of Saturday night’s Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics at Disney’s Wide World of Sports complex.  &gt;Although Kendrick Nunn had been cast as the Heat starting point guard during the regular season before giving way to Goran Dragic in the opening lineup in the playoffs, Spoelstra said Butler long has been a de facto floor leader.

It was heavily reported about Jimmy butting heads with the older guys on the team due to their loyalty to Rose. Not soon after, Rose was traded.   He most definitely wanted to be the ball handler in Philly.  &gt;Butler admitted to asking Brown to handle the ball more often, but he said he felt it was a mistake to make such a drastic switch:  &gt;""To this day, I don't think that that was fair, to switch over like that. Even though I think we played great basketball like that, I don't think it was fair, because the entire year, Ben had the ball, the entire year, Ben had the ball, so you mean to tell me that in one playoff series you just switch it up like that?

He has said so multiple times."
"&gt;even without Hayward the C’s were a really good   Kemba was playing with an injured knee the entire playoffs. So no Hayward and Kemba producing well below his average is not the same as beating a ""healthy"" Celtics.   &gt;and the Bucks only didn’t “look like themselves”   I mean you can look at them play during the bubble and the 8 games before the playoffs started and compare that to how they were playing before the NBA stopped playing. Tell me its the same team.  &gt;And acting like falling short of beating the Lakers when you’re forced to give Kendrick fucking Nunn and Meyers Leonard minutes instead of Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo.  I really doubt they would have advanced against the Clippers or Nuggets either.   I'm not saying the Heat are a bad team but they overachieved and got the most benefit from the bubble situation."
"What the fuck is a “real” opponent? Get the fuck out with this trash, even without Hayward the C’s were a really good team, and the Bucks only didn’t “look like themselves” because the Heat outplayed them so badly without any major injuries for all of the games that mattered. And acting like falling short of beating the Lakers when you’re forced to give Kendrick fucking Nunn and Meyers Leonard minutes instead of Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo."
"95% of the time it’s just a cliche, doesn’t actually mean anything. Most teams, even terrible ones, have comradery and work ethic. However the 5% of the time that it actually means something it’s when a team’s values, chemistry, and mentally lead to a team being better than the sum of its parts. Like the Miami Heat had some pretty below average Rosters from 2017-2019 and they were always competing for the 8th seed sometimes even better, one year they were the sixth seed with old Goran Dragic as their best player compare that a team like the Wolves that had a comparable maybe even better roster and you’ll see the difference.  So basically if a team is better than the sum of its part is because of the “winning culture”."
"ESPN: Heat Guard Goran Dragic STOLE up to $6,000 of COFFEE from Teammate"
We also had Kyle Lowry and one time all star Goran Dragic on our team.
TIL Goran Dragic is an r/NBA mod.
"I can't remember where I read it, but I think the issue was ego/talent. He went to a team with Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. That team also eventually acquired Isaiah Thomas and Devin Booker. He was a young player on a team with established guards and then a franchise guy. I think he didn't appreciate his role or minutes. Lots of talented guys wash out of the league because they don't understand how to stick. I also remember him not being able to really shoot, so it probably contributed to his leaving the NBA."
"Yeah I corrected myself.  Guess who has similar accolades? Goran Dragic. Also, he barely snuck on to the third team last year, only made it due to positional shenanigans and Curry/Durant being injured. I would wager he never makes another All-NBA team in his career."

Goran Dragic
"If this is true, then MJ and Kobe shouldn't even be top 20 players of all-time.  If you can't even make the playoffs in a weak conference like that over teams like the Wizards.  Even Goran Dragic and Miami won 44 games and got the 6th seed."

It bothers me just for the sake of consistency alone, but they don't care. Shaq continuously does the same, of course, even though he and Dragic were teammates over a decade ago."
"Can you think of an analogous and successful pairing? Non-shooting point-forward type + ball dominant ISO player + non-shooting center who isn’t great in the half-court offense... and who else? Kelly would have to go, so they’re spacing the floor with Goran Dragic and who? Harden would have to be relegated to an off ball role for there to be any semblance of harmony, and if that happens... why did you give up two of the best shooters in the league? The weird fit + culture issues make me think Riley made a good call here."
"&gt;Centerpiece would have been Lamar Odom, Luis Scola and Kevin Martin which is still pretty darn good.  I'm not even sure what you are trying to say here, but Dragic is the only All-star and All-NBA player in that group.  &gt;Flip them to contenders like OKC did and you can get 3 picks from that and a young Goran Dragic.   No.  You don't trade Kevin Martin for ""a pick"" that, if you get lucky, might be half the player he was at that time."
"Centerpiece would have been Lamar Odom, Luis Scola and Kevin Martin which is still pretty darn good. Flip them to contenders like OKC did and you can get 3 picks from that and a young Goran Dragic."
Bonus:   **[THE 2011 'BASKETBALL REASONS' TRADE](https://imgur.com/cIIChmq)**   **Los Angeles Lakers recieve:**  * Chris Paul   **New Orleans Hornets recieve:**   * Lamar Odom (from LAL)  * Kevin Martin (from HOU)  * Luis Scola (from HOU)  * Goran Dragic (from HOU)   **Houston Rockets recieve:**  * Pau Gasol (from LA Lakers)  Who wins? 😉
"That’s just not true thou the lakers deal was better than the clippers deal Goran Dragic, Luis scola, Lamar Odom, kevin Martin and the Knicks 1st round pick. That’s far from a bad deal it can argued New Orleans would have been better off with that deal."
"&gt;return package for New Orleans was awful  New Orleans would've received Goran Dragic, Lamar Odom, Luis Scola, Kevin Martin, and a Knicks' 1st.  That's an outstanding return."
"hey Duncan my man, how are you doing? Two questions:  Did Goran Dragic teach you how to curse in Slovenian, or maybe even Serbian/Croatian?  What would you give/how much would you pay, to play NBA finals again with the Miami Heat, but this time in ""normal"" circumstances with filled arena's?"
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."
"Hey Duncan, born and raised Miami Heat fan that also lives in the same neighborhood as Goran Dragic and now Myles Leonard. If I run into any one of them is there any inside joke or funny thing I can say to get their attention? I know it’s a long shot but would love to see their reaction. Congrats again on the Finals run and looking forward to a 3 point trophy from you in the near future. Great work on the JJ podcast btw! Go Heat!!!"
Goran Dragic was robbed for 6MOTY last year and it would be a crime for him to get robbed again.
"I feel like Goran Dragic is the most Tony Parker-esque star of the 3-point era. His ability to get to the rim and finish up-and-unders screams Tony to me while his complentary skills as a midrange scorer provides versatility as a scoring point guard similar to Parker. Obviously Dragic's spacing provides the well-rounded game expected of high level point guards nowadays but I always think of him as the evolution of Parker. I feel like these type of guards will go extinct soon similar to traditional centers, since lack of spacing coupled with a lower defensive ceiling actively harms their potential. The young player I think of now of this mold is Markelle with his ability to snake around defenders to get layups, but that's about it."
Flopping is like 90% of his game.   Goran dragic is what people think that James harden is
"I would agree with this statement if the Heat would have lost the finals 4-0 or 4-1, but they took 2 games of the Lakers even without their main 6th man Goran Dragic. You may think they overachieved, but most teams have their hot streaks, the only difference is some have in the playoffs, some have in the regular season. The Heat were a fake 5th seed, and it's not their fault that the Bucks were awful and Boston couldn't pull it all together.  Also, you have to give credit to the training staff for preparing the team. You could clearly see that the Heat were the most physically prepared team."
I think Goran Dragic is similar to Redd in the sense that he’s a really good player but if he’s your best player your team’s ceiling is capped at the lower echelon of playoff teams.
My optimistic hope for killian has always been to become goran dragic which I would be happy about
They are fucking around but it's to protect Ad from injury and be smart. Only when they are forced to do they play their best lineup. Even in the Houston series they kept starting Javale.  Yes Avery Bradley. You're crying about Goran Dragic as if he would have made a difference lmao
Goran Dragic.
Lol and you can say funny shit like Goran Dragic is the most shoot first GD we've seen in a while.

"A lot of people who were low on him didn't seem to appreciate HOW good he was in Euroleague.  Most Euroleague prospects are either young and raw players who get picked for promising skillsets and athletic tools - e.g. Dragan Bender put up 2.1 ppg in 11 mpg for a sub-bar Maccabi Tel Aviv team before being picked #4. Or else they are more established players without much upside when get picked as win-now prospects, like Bogdan Bogdonavac who was drafted at 25.  Meanwhile Luka was the youngest ever Euroleague MVP during his 18 year old season en route to leading Real to a Euroleague title. He also led Slovenia - not exactly a traditional basketball powerhouse - to the Eurobasket title alongside Goran Dragic.  On top of his pedigree, there was no shortage of film of Doncic playing against legit NBA talents. In the Eurobasket tournament alone, he matched up against Porzingis' Latvia team, the French team with Boris Diaw and Evan Fournier and the Spanish team with both Gasol brothers, both Hernanogomez brothers, Ricky Rubio and Sergio Rodriguez.  That's a much more impressive track record than the level of talent that say, DeAndre Ayton, Marvin Bagley, or Trae Young played against in the NCAA, and that's not even considering the fact that Doncic was playing against grown men while the NCAA prospects were playing against other kids their age. For comparison, Ayton's Wildcats got blown tf out by a Buffalo Bulls team with no future NBA players in the first round of the NCAA tournament."
"[Watch this 40-second clip](https://youtu.be/l8B79qgqOV4) and closely look at Goran’s face throughout.  Dragic is speaking right after he won Eurobasket gold+MVP with the 18yo Luka as his #2 (where Luka also got one of the remaining 4 spots on the all-tournament team). And after Goran&amp;Luka were roommates for something like two months straight during training camp and the tournament. Over the following 9 months teenage Luka proceeded to win EuroLeague MVP, Euroleague FinalFour MVP, Spanish League MVP and both respective championships.  All everyone had to do was to listen to the veteran All-Star/All-NBA guard who spent pretty much every waking (and sleeping) moment with the kid for two months, including in just about the highest-stress situations possible on a basketball court."
"In no particular order: Brogdan, Oladipo, Sexton, Trae Young, Kyrie, Kemba, Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic, Zach Lavine, Lowry, Beal, and Russ are all better   And that’s not even including guys with higher ceilings like Garland or Fultz.   He’s not a top 5 guard in the east. Sorry"
"I followed Goran's career because some people said that he was like Manu (I'm Argentine). He is not Manu, but he is Goran and that's more than enough.   Amazing player, he never complains about anything, he just plays and earns his minutes.  An example: Barton said he was not a 6th man or something. Dragic wouldn't do that, he just plays so well that he earns the starter position and his coach has to shut his mouth up.  PS: My cousin lives in Miami and I asked him Goran's jersey. He bought Bosh's. I didn't wear it once. You have to love Goran."
"It's gotta be Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic/Bam Adebayo or Jaylen Brown/Kemba Walker.   Those are the only 3rd options in the league that are all star caliber players."
Guy saying Goran Dragic as if that’s a slight.   Dragic was an All-Star/All-NBA with a fairly long career too. Even now he is a great player/fringe all-star at 34
What’s a high level? Goran Dragic? Why would you take a project Dragic at 7 overall?

"I believe Goran Dragic did something similar to this in the Heat/Mavs game tonight and it was called a foul on Dallas. So yeah, no standard."
Goran Dragic is not untouchable
"It's actually [this pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c9qunc/is_the_unprotected_2021_miami_heat_draft_pick_the/)  From another link but this breaks down where the pick traveled succinctly.  &gt;The Heat first dealt it in 2015 to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragic. Three years later, the Suns sent the pick to the 76ers for the right to move up and select Mikal Bridges on draft night 2018. The 76ers then shipped it to the Los Angeles Clippers as part of a package for Tobias Harris. The Clippers, of course, traded it to OKC as one of five first-rounders in the Paul George deal."
Trading dragic to get Lowry isn’t a big enough upgrade to be worth it. Sure Lowry is better but not by a crazy amount. Goran has been fantastic as a 6th man and mentor to his teammates he also embodies Heat culture. Trades aren’t always about getting the better player
Goran Dragic and any combination of heat starts is money.
"Maybe I'm a bit too high on Fox in the late 30s, but he's an exciting young talent. I like to give young, exciting players that improve on a year-to-year basis the benefit of the doubt that they can get even better.  Realistically he's probably ""only"" top 50. Gordon Hayward, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic &amp; Co. would probably all be players you would rather have in a play-off series if it took place tomorrow."
Goran Dragic lol
Feels like you’re walking on hot lava. Goran Dragic has BALLS.
"This is a gross oversimplification of Bam's defense lol. Dude guards all 5 positions every night, switching every pick and roll, covering for defensive mistakes made by putrid defenders like Olynyk, Duncan, Herro, Dragic, etc. He regularly bottles up perimeter stars into passing away from that matchup. Numbers don't equate for this shit lol.   Bam is a top 5 defender in the NBA. Miami has a top 5-6 defense with 3 positive defenders on it and 10 horrendous ones on it. Like, worst in the league bad. Orlando has a below average defense. 18th in drtg and 22nd in field goal % against. There is a grand canyon gap between Bam's defense and Vucevic's. The gap between them defensively is probably 5x the difference between them offensively.   Bam is close to Gobert defensively, if not certainly more useful come playoff time. Utah somehow has a worse defensive field goal % against than we do despite the fact that Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus are arguably bottom 20 defensive players of anyone getting minutes in the NBA."
"Oh yeah I’m sure Brook Lopez going 1-on-1 with Goran Dragic while Giannis is guarding Butler is a great way to win the series. Bro stick to your lakers game, why tf do you bring your bleacher report level takes to just shit on the man?"

Unrelated but Goran Dragic is very hot
I wouldn’t hesitate for those kind of players but I don’t think it’s out of the question that he could have a Goran Dragic-esque peak.
Goran Dragic if you think in percentages probably
"I mean more like when a guy is a one time all star you don't hear ""all star Goran Dragic"" or ""All Star Kristaps Porzingis"" but you can hardly say Conley's name without a comment about how he's been snubbed his whole career."
The Goran Dragic special
"&gt;Had a claim to be the best player in Euroleague, at 18! Literally none of the great Euro players of all time achieved so much at such a young age. I think people just really failed to comprehend the gravity of his achievements.  I noticed during that time the doubters were looking at all the guys that were hyped 20-something year olds in Europe that didn't pan out into anything special in the NBA... but nobody was looking at the Euro careers of guys who did turn into special players in the NBA (Petrovic, Dirk, Peja, Kukoc, Manu, Gasol bros, Parker, etc). A 16-18 year old Luka's career was comparable if not better than those guys at their best in Europe. All the grown men around him including a prideful Goran Dragic were calling Luka the best player."
"I say three way deal....  Sacramento gets-Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Kelly Olynyk and second rounders   Lakers get-Buddy Hield, Goran Dragic &amp; Hassan Whiteside   Miami gets-Harrison Barnes, Marc Gasol &amp; Talen Horton Tucker     Sacramento gets Kyle Kuzma and sheds Barnes salary. KCP and Okynyk give them veteran bench pieces.   Lakers improve their backcourt and get a good rim protector.   Heat gets Barnes as a stretch 4, Gasol becomes a sold backup to Bam and Tucker becomes a young piece and can learn from Iggy."
"Think about it..Kyle Korver and Goran Dragic aren't really people who I'd envision social media saying ""KORVER GOT ROBBED"" or ""DRAGIC GOT ROBBED""."
"Commissioner decides the replacement, but Silver doesn't go with the PR pick, he's selected Kyle Korver, Andre Drummond, and Goran Dragic in the past you can't sit with a straight face and tell me it's what the fans want to see."
"being outplayed by Goran Dragic wasn't a good look, personally."
i mean you requested a 3-requirement-statistic   &gt; second best player  &gt; championship team  &gt; same usage as AD  with a legitimate real-world equivalent  &gt; goran dragic: 27.3 USG  &gt; anthony davis: 27.2 USG  and now suddenly i'm the idiot because i didn't comb through the last 40 years of NBA Championship Rosters to find the second-best-player who was also injured in the season with a specifically 27.2% USG rate
"Dragic  Wade  LeBron  Bosh  Mourning  Yes, it is finally time to bump Tim Hardaway off the all time 5 for Goran. Most may not realize it but Goran’s tenure is already longer than Hardaway’s was and I’ll take taking us to the Finals than being top 5 in MVP voting and getting bounced by the Knicks almost every year.   Depending on how things go, Bam should take Zo’s spot. Jimmy might end up taking Goran’s spot with LeBron or Wade playing the point."
"Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, Domantas Sabonis, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic"
"idk man my points have been the same througout. Lowry misses fewer games, is a better player, and goran isnt a dealbreaker for a trade. You attacked my missed games point and i specified, specifying doesnt mean moving the goal posts.  &amp;#x200B;  as the discussion went to the larger trade as a whole i reiterated the point that 1 rookie, a pick, and an expiring point guard who is worse than lowry isnt something thats the heat would hate imo. You can come downvote my comments and say im moving the goalposts again, but 1. specifying isnt moving the goal posts especially when i had very vague statements in the beginning and 2. your points are very weak.  &gt; You responded with “it’s not even like Goran is Playing” when he has played multiple games this year and has been a solid player for them.   he missed nearly half the games played this year in a shortened season and has an team option the heat will probably not pick up this year, they signed him for a trade asset and as solid as he is playing lowry is better.   &gt; Everything else you are throwing in is filler to change the goal post, because Goran has played this season will play this week, and is a solid player for the Heat.   Literally everything i said is to point out that as ""solid"" as he played for them, he isnt an untradable piece espeically for an allstar pointguard.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; You can’t even specify what Goran’s injury concerns are.   This is the first time you brought up this point. 1. he is a 34 yearold pointguard coming off a terrible  plantar fascia tear, a foot injury which can cause more lower body injuries 2. he was out for multiple different lower body injuries this year.  &amp;#x200B;  Trying to spin him coming back this weak as him having no concern for injuries or that he didnt miss nearly half the season already is ridiculous. To spin a player averaging 14/2/3 as untradable ""because he is solid"" is also ridicolous.  &amp;#x200B;  If your point is that the heat can get more off that package then lowry then make that point, if your point is dragic is too good to trade then stop right there because that is a terrible point."
"&gt;Do you think they'll still make the playoffs?   100%  &gt;and if so what seed?   Somewhere between 4h and 7th seed  Almost every team in the league currently ""underperforming"" is a combination of Covid, injury, luck, and unreasonable expectations  A huge part of what the Heat did in the bubble was hot shooting and Goran Dragic. Well Dragic has been out and their shooting has cooled off, so it's not particularly surprising that when you combine that with Butler missing time that they don't win as much"

"yeah the heat's poor performance this season with COVID, injuries, lack of quality PF, lack of quality PG, constant rotation changes proves that  the bubble where no one had COVID and no injuries and had Jae Crowder and All-Star calibur Goran Dragic is illegitimate.  yall say the dumbest shit"
"Who knows. Goran Dragic has been hurt recently and Jimmy's coming off COVID but doesn't look that bad. I think the bigger issue is they're putting a ton of pressure on Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro to produce on both ends and maybe they're just not ready to be so important to a competitive team's starting 5?  When you're depending on Kendrick Nunn, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro to perform well, you gotta kinda accept the inconsistently that comes with it."
We need to blow this team up honestly. Trade Goran Dragic for a 1st. Trade Herro and Duncan and see what kind of assets you can get for them. Build around Bam and Jimmy if Jimmy still even wants to stay here

"Bubble was a fluke, it’s pretty obvious. Bubble made goran Dragic look like an all-star lol."
"definitely not a lock, he and Randle has similar stat lines but the Magic are 10-18. We've seen time and time again how coaches vote for all stars on playoff teams, that's how Goran Dragic made it despite other players having a better stat line than him"
Him vs Goran Dragic would be the most popular thing on here during the playoffs if we could magically bring back those teams and replay that 2010 Suns lakers series next week
I will never forget the call of his dunk on Goran Dragic. Legitimately one of my favorite calls of all time.
"&gt;that's three power forwards i can't go through this again after last year.  Issue with last year was Al Horford wasnt a real floor spacer nobody actually guards him despite what his %s are. Otto Porter is. Even as recently [Otto Porter used to be a rather versatile defender](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/) theyd put him on guys like Goran Dragic. That's another difference with him and Horford, Horford it was pushing it to have him guard 3s and some 4s even. Whether Tobias is a 3 or 4 defensively doesnt really make any difference for him.   Also Otto's gonna play 25ish min a game in this hypothetical you can stagger his minutes I dont its a big issue the fit.   That said this is all just a hypothetical he makes too much it's not gonna happen so wouldnt really worry about it."
Shoutout Goran Dragic. That dude don’t give a fuck.
"I’m fairly certain this was in reference to Shaq during last years NBA playoffs reflecting on how rookies are traditionally hazed and/or given a “hard time” in order for them to show their toughness and earn the respect of vets... And how in his experience this process was largely intimidating to a number of the very young players entering the league, who took their “beatings” so to speak.. But then well into his seasoned career he was on a vet laden Phoenix Suns team, and along came a young and spry European player by the name of Goran Dragic, who Shaq quickly took notice of being cut from a different cloth... He would battle Steve Nash daily in practice and mostly take his lessons but would not allow any amount of disrespect... So one day Shaq questioned him, interested in the origin of his ability to withstand the adverse treatment that rookies typically go through... And Goran (I’m heavily paraphrasing) replied “I grew up through war in my country (Slovenia, part of former Yugoslavia). I’ve seen it all already. There’s nothing any one of you can do to intimidate or strike fear into me like that I was before the NBA.”"
Where would you put Goran Dragic?
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
I think Goran Dragic is legally required to stop him if he tries
"&gt; With tonight's win, the Phoenix Suns will finish above .500 for the first time since 2013-2014  &gt; The last Phoenix team to finish above 0.500 was led by the trio of Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic, and Gerald Green. That team finished with 48 wins but missed the playoffs.  lol... meanwhile the wizards/bullets are sitting over here like “you think that’s a string of mediocrity? I’ll show y’all mofockers a string”. (Proceeds to drop 40 seasons of bullshit on table)  The wizards/bullets have not won 50 games (59% of 82 game season) since... 1979. Just think about that. The last time the wizards won 50 games in a season the empire strikes back was still in production.  The 48 win 13/14 LOTTERY season for the suns would have been the wizards second best record in that span. Just think about that. Second best season since Jimmy Carter was in office and it wouldn’t have even given them a playoff birth."

"&gt;Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, Goran Dragic, and Lamar Odom would’ve plunged us into mediocrity at the time.  ""Plunged""?  New Orleans went 46-36 the preceding season, and won the #7 seed on a tie-break.  If that's not mediocre, what is?  More to the point, the best season New Orleans ever had even with Davis was exactly 2 more wins, in 2018."
"Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, Goran Dragic, and Lamar Odom would’ve plunged us into mediocrity at the time.

Sadly goran dragic
Why you hef to be med? - Goran Dragic
I'm also fairly certain that Goran Dragic has a brother named Zoran lol. I think he even played for the Suns at one point.
&gt;were not drafted for their athleticism  I did not say they were. Nobody did. I said they are athletic. Goran Dragic is unathletic. Draymond Green is unathletic.  &gt;Luka has the body of a 7/11 employee  See you guys have no clue what you’re talking about. You can count the 6’8” 230 7/11 employees of the world on one hand and none of them have his mobility. You can’t have Curry’s handles without crazy athleticism. Nevermind that neither of those guys were raw coming into the NBA.  Killian has no physical tools to work with and isn’t great at anything. KOC put him on top of his board and nobody wanted to miss the next Luka.
Jae Crowder and Goran Dragic
Did Goran Dragic really leave that bad a taste in their mouth that they refused to entertain another Slovenian player?
He was getting outplayed by Goran Dragic in Houston.

Give me Goran Dragic and D’Angelo Russell over all of those guys
"Mike Conley, CP3, Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic. I'd rather have these guys than pay Dennis 20M+/year"
dragic has been missing for a lot of the season and when he has played it was when jimmy was out so they have been missing 1/2 of their most dominant ball handlers for a lot of the season. When jimmy and goran both play their record is better and the offensive numbers are up
Goran Dragic? Bam Adebayo? Hell even Jae Crowder was raining 3's.
"Sure you can. /r/nba criticises Lowry all the time. He plays hard and when you play hard sometimes you toe the line of being dirty. I don't think Lowry is going out trying to hurt people on purpose and I don't think that he's unacceptably dirty in the way Robert Horry or Patrick Beverley play. He's in that Goran Dragic, Marcus Smart tier of guys who play a hard game. As for flopping, another criticism of Lowry's, that seems to be the way the game is going. Most teams have a player or two who are similarly bad. This is an issue with the officials and how offensive players are rewarded for flopping.  You are talking to me, not my fan base. Some people get sensitive when it comes to their stars, but you can't generalize entire fan bases. I genuinely believe Ben Simmons is overrated and that his game won't translate well to playoff success. This is a matter of opinion and whenever I express that I'm met with a flood of downvotes from people who refuse to even engage in a discussion with me. Are they all Sixers fans downvoting me? Maybe. Does that mean that all Sixer fans have a sus amount of affection for Ben Simmons? Probably not."
"The NBA owned a majority stake in the Hornets (before they changed their name to the Pelicans) franchise, so David Stern was the de facto owner. Dell Demps was the gm, and he made a trade with the Lakers that was absolutely terrible:  Lakers get: Chris Paul (26)  Hornets get: Lamar Odom (32), Kevin Martin (28), Luis Scola (31), Goran Dragic (25)  Rockets get: Pau Gasol (31)  David Stern thought this was an absolutely terrible trade and vetoed it.  He instead set up a trade with the Clippers:  Clippers get: Chris Paul  Hornets get: Eric Gordon (23), Al Farouq Aminu (21), Chris Kaman (29) and an unprotected first round pick from the Timberwolves.  In retrospect, the original Lakers trade wouldn't have been *that* bad for the Hornets because Dragic ended up being a good player, but at the time he wasnt seen as a lot. Stern felt like the Lakers trade was a very bad deal for a team about to enter a rebuild, and that since Demps is not authorized to make a trade without ownership approval, it was within his rights to veto the trade. Eric Gordon was the 7th overall pick in 2008, and Aminu was the 8th pick in 2010, so at the time they were seen as good prospects, and from a rebuilding perspective it was a much better trade for the Hornets."
"TLDR: Nobody is going to value ""LaMarcus Aldridge averages 6 minutes a game for the Brooklyn Nets and wins a ring"" more than ""Jimmy Butler takes team of Goran Dragic and 1st/2nd/3rd year players to the finals and loses."" If someone believes these former All-NBA players are trash for not winning rings as the primary options in their primes, they aren't going to suddenly change their minds and think they're gods now that they're riding the bench as the 10th option at 62 years old. People here are constantly attacking the narrative that rings are *all* people care about and that these players being dragged to the finish line in the bum stage of their careers is somehow going to change how they're perceived. No sane person actually believes that."
"The difference in that argument for a player like Aldridge is not gonna be whether they trick or treated for a ring pop at the end of their career. People aren't gonna suddenly look back at Aldridge NBA resume and think ""wow he got a ring playing 4 minutes a game, what an absolute god. He's so much better than Jimmy Butler, who took a team of sophomores and Goran Dragic to the finals.""  The rings argument matters when it's a player like Shaq shit talking a player like Chuck. Or if it's LeBron trying to make his case against Jordan. LeBron makes a super team and the rings still become a part of his narrative because he's the one who's carrying those teams. Nobody's going to look at LaMarcus fucking Aldridge or DeAndre Jordan and suddenly change their opinions on them because they averaged 2 points while benchwarming for the most stacked team in the league."
"Ya that was the problem. The owners didn't like that it made the Lakers better not that they didn't like what NOLA got. It was an obvious overreach by Stern peasing mainly jordan along with cuban and other owners that didnt want to see Kobe and Lakers continue to dominate. The trade was fair and ended up being the better offer than what NOLA ended up getting.    Lamar Odom (reigning 6MOTY) Kevin Martin (20+scorer), Luis Scola (18ppg/8r), Goran Dragic (arguably still a better asset than Eric Gordan) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Eric Gordon, Kaman, Aminu (less 2 second round picks)  That veto is one of the biggest shams in all of sports history."
"I agree with that sentiment this year. But it doesn’t really put us over the top tbh, just firmly in the mix. And even then Lowry’s gonna be 36 next year. I heard Raps fans saying that Lowry has aged really well and while I agree with that, we also have our own 36 yr old PG in Goran who just went from an All Star level playoff run to showing his age suddenly. Having 36 year old Lowry and 37 year old Dragic as the PGs next year is a risky proposition imo."
"lebron is injured, jimmy butler has had injuries this year, Goran Dragic has had injuries your trying really hard celtic fan"
The Goran Dragic/Channing Frye PnR was the deadliest combo during the 2013 season. I'm sure Lebron already knew that when he was spamming the play against the Hawks.

"The Suns tried to brand Goran Dragic and Eric Bledsoe as the Slash Brothers  https://www.nba.com/suns/gallery/five-amazing-stats-you-didnt-know-about-slash-brothers#  Rose and Butler were also called the Slash Bros for a bit in 2015/2016 range, but it didn’t catch on because the team was mediocre."
Goran Dragic
1. Goran Dragic (All Star (sub-in) like 2 seasons ago) 2. James Harden (MVP and multiple NBA scoring leader) 3. Jimmy Butler (Averaged 26.2pts in his only Finals appearance to date) 4. Kelly Olynyk ( 3&amp;D player (needs work on both tho) ) 5. Bam Adebayo (last year All-Star whose young with a very high ceiling IMO)     Pretty decent starting squad but they definitely lose their depth in the process. Not so sure it would've been worth it.
"They weren’t trash, they were just not on the level of typical Finals teams. On top of that, two of their three best players missed a lot of time. Goran Dragic was playing at an All Star level and got his minutes replaced by a rookie who averaged 11.5 MPG in the playoffs when he wasn’t getting DNPs."
"A rarely used 2nd string pg from the Suns named goran dragic, against the Spurs in the 4th quarter of the I believe 09 playoffs? Anyway it was insane"
"Also, 24 yo Goran Dragic went off against the Spurs in the 2010 WCSF.  In game 3 he scored 23 in the fourth, he was 10 of 13 and 5/5 from three. It might not seem random now that Dragic could do that but at the time the highlight of his career was getting dunked on by D rose."
"Goran Dragic played so well he baited our idiot GM to completely fuck up our rebuild, and then immediately pissed him off by bringing Isaiah Thomas. I'm still salty over that."
Goran mf Dragic
Of all the strange things that have happened in the NBA in recent years the Heat becoming lovable underdogs led by Jimmy Butler and Goran Dragic is perhaps the most unexpected.
Goran Dragic in the year he made all-nba is legit one of the most exciting guards I've ever seen
Goran Dragic is playing basketball just so you know
Wow. Goran Dragic had a 4th quarter flashback to the 2010 Western Semis vs the Spurs
PG: Goran Dragic  SG: Dwyane Wade   SF: Lebron James   PF: Tim Duncan  C: Dwight Howard
Reminds me of the Goran Dragic clip in Europe
"**TEAM KESAVAHRAJ**  New expansion team owner G_Kesavahraj immediately earns the support of his fan base after adding a star laden roster that appears to fit very well together. Wings Bradley Beal and Jimmy Butler highlight the group, while BFFs Tobias Harris and Boban earn the fan love on social immediately.  After a 3-3 start to the year, the team finds their rhythm and chemistry. Beal and Butler prove to be an ideal yin/yang, as Beal provides the shooting and spacing while Butler focused on crashing to the line, dishing, and bothering every other wing on defense. Both players average 20 PPG as the team swells up to a 28-20 record midway through the year. Both Beal and Butler make the All-Star team.  At times, the presence of Boban as a starter slows the team's pace down, but with Beal and Tobias Harris the club still feels like they have enough shooting to play a half court game if need be. The club finishes the regular season as the # 3 seed out East.  In the playoffs, the team turns up the gas even more, crushing the feel-good story Knicks 4-1 in round one. Goran Dragic showcases his own scoring prowess in the series with 21 PPG, perhaps having saved up his energy for the playoffs. At this point, the team truly feels like a title threat.  But in round two, the group matches up against the Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis, who may prove a handful for them. Sure enough, Tobias Harris struggles with the matchup, and switching over Jimmy Butler leaves some open holes on the perimeter. Khris Middleton hits 5 threes in game 2, leading to a 2-0 lead for the Bucks.  Now down in the series, all the good vibes start turning sour. Jimmy Butler gives a press conference, blasting the team's defensive effort (and making indirect shots at Beal in the process.) The group responds with a strong Game 3 win, but falls back into old habits in a Game 4 loss. Butler puts the team on his back and scores 31 in Game 5 to pull off another win and take the series back to 3-2. Still, the Bucks' hot shooting ends up carrying them in Game 6, leading to a bitter defeat.   The team licks its wounds and pride after the loss. Surely, they had the talent to compete for a title, but it just wasn't in the cards this season."
"**TEAM INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION**  The NBA is thrilled to announce a new franchise, particularly one chocked full of international talent. TV rights are through the roof throughout Europe, particularly in tapping into the Indian market.  While some pundits are skeptical that it will translate to the success ON the court, Team I.E.T. looks quite strong early on. The 1-2 punch of prime Dirk Nowitzki and Nikola Jokic proves nearly unguardable down low, particularly given their complementary skill sets. Dirk leads the team with 24 points per game, while Jokic adds on 17-11-7. Goran Dragic is no slouch either, picking up the playmaking slack when Jokic sits. The team ends up with the # 3 ranked offense in the NBA.  Defensively, the team has some issues, particularly in terms of the athleticism of the modern wings. Inexperienced Bavid Blatt struggles to come up with a system to stop the bleeding, leading the team to be ranked # 28 on that end. All in all, the statistical profile projects as a near .500 team that fights tooth and nail to make the playoffs.  With a 39-40 record, the playoffs looks like it may be out of reach. However, Dirk Nowitzki goes supernova in the final week, scoring 33 points, 37 points, and 35 points to finish up 3-0 and get the team into the playoff field with a 42-40 record.  That said, the playoffs doesn't go according to plan. Matched up with an offensive juggernaut in Brooklyn, their defense gets exposed and I.E.T. loses 4-1."

What are some of the Heat players snacks on the road? Do you guys have a stash of snacks on the bus/ plane? Does Goran Dragic like beef jerky?
Goran dragic made all nba 3rd team in 2014. Ironically that season probably extended the suns' tank by a couple seasons...

Imagine keeping Bledsoe over Isiah Thomas (pre hip injury) and Goran Dragic. My team WOULD NEVER
"It is but interesting enough. Bam without Jimmy 987 minutes 114 defensive rating, Jimmy without Bam 644 minutes 107 defensive rating. Jimmy and Bam 1154 minutes 109 defensive rating. So the stats say that Jimmy is consistently their best defensive player this season. He is also 1st in steals, tied for 3rd in defensive loose balls recovered, 3rd in deflections per game, 4th in defensive rating of 105.4. Dude has been a beast defensively. Not to mention the Heat are top 5 defence despite guys like Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn and Goran Dragic playing heavy minutes."
"[Flashback to last playoffs when the Celtics wanted us so badly to beat Milwaukee so we'd play 'em in the ECF.](https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/ilfrhl/more_nervous_about_heat_in_the_ecf_than_bucks/)  Now we've effectively ended their season in back-to-back years. Granted, anything can happen - but even if the Celtics survive the play-in games they're asking for a humiliating 4/5-game series at the ends of Philly/Brooklyn, and it came at the hands of Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic yet again. Life comes at you fast."
"Goran Dragic and Gabe Vincent, but that's my final offer. 👀"
"&gt; What do you expect from Killian?  Since you want to pretend that you've put in thought on something that I've actually put several months of thought and research in. I will answer this question.  I didn't understand the Killian hype. I truly didn't think he was going to be picked early in the lottery at all because I couldn't justify it. He wasn't a good scorer or shooter, he was pretty light, unathletic, couldn't dribble with his right, and wasn't a special enough passer to make up for all of that.  So when he was drafted my expectation was to see something new. And that can happen with young draft prospects, people spot the x-factor before you and you see it later. However, it did not make sense with Killian. Killian was a child, unathletic and not particularly skilled. There's no great prospect like that in the history of the league.  When he got to the league I saw indeed he wasn't a good scorer or shooter, he was pretty light, unathletic, couldn't dribble with his right, and wasn't a special enough passer to make up for all of that.  So my expectation for that is to see the guy work hard and in 4-5 years be a legitimate PG ala Goran Dragic. That's not worth a lottery pick."
Yea Goran Dragic never gets the respect he deserves either but it’s still not a skin color problem
"Its impressive for his age, but at times he was literally making shit up lol. In the first quarter he was talking about how Goran Dragic was injured all last year and how Duncan played in Europe after college."
"That’s really great.  Yeah shooters help a lot haha.   For us Jimmy plays hard, but I know his life was made easier last year with Duncan, Tyler Herro, and Goran dragic spacing the floor  So it’s definitely cool to see what an mvp candidate in Embiid can do. Good luck in the playoffs and give the Nets hell!!"
"So damn wholesome. One of the cooler parts of the NBA is seeing guys embrace foreign players and their culture. I think of Jimmy Butts immersing himself in Slovenian culture to appeal to Goran Dragic, Boban &amp; Tobias...basketball is really a global game!"
"Raps’ rotation was astoundingly solid at defense, like even amongst finals winning teams. The Bucks’ losses with Bledsoe, Brogdon, and Hill on the team I just remember thinking over and over about how weird it is that they kept rostering point guards who *are* successful and high-impact, but like in every way except ball-handling and dribble penetration. Like if you replace Bledsoe with Goran Dragic or someone (maybe, as a hyperbolic example, Ja Morant or SGA) you could get things flowing again.   Really wonder how it’s gonna look with Jrue as that option this year."

"Lmao in what world?  Damian Lillard missed 2 weeks with plantar fasciitis in 2015. Goran Dragic played through it in the Finals last year and then was fine pretty soon after in the offseason. Google will tell you the average recovery for this injury in the NBA is around 3-5 weeks. I have never once in my life seen somebody miss **two months** with plantar fasciitis, so I'm gunna absolutely call bullshit on this.   Unless he completely tore his plantar fascia this is just trying to rationalize the stupid tanking by OKC."
"We're on r/nba, you know there are people who will make that claim seriously.   Also, I was curious myself where Rubio would end up.

He was a starter in the NBA for 10 years, and he might have gotten a better reputation had he played on some good teams."

"&gt; The players you listed that would have been top 5 in 2012 would not have been top 5 in 2011. Wade, Lebron, Kobe, CP3, and Dwight  I think there's a typo in what you wrote, but many of those players now are playing at a higher level than Dwight has ever played (Giannis and AD are both easily better than Dwight ever was, for starters), and higher than Kobe in 2011 who averaged a ho-hum 25/5/5 on 55% TS.  &gt; This would be the top 10 in 2010-2011 time; Kobe/Lebron/CP3/Wade/Dwight/Dirk/Duncan/Rose/Durant/Carmelo.  I used the year 2012 so let's go with that (it's slightly better towards the late 2000s as you get more into the prime of Kobe, KG, Duncan, Nash, Dirk, and others).  Duncan, Dirk, KG, and Kobe were clearly past their prime by 2012 (and had a much greater dropoff in production than, say, LeBron at a similar age).  &gt; Some notable guys left off the list include Rondo(lead Celtics to a 7 game series against 2011-2012 Heat), Chris Bosh, Griffin, Love, etc.  I don't see any argument that any of these players are anywhere near any of the players I listed.  Bosh, Griffin, and especially Love (who joined Cleveland at 26 in what should have been his absolute prime and then was instantly revealed to actually be a pure good stats/bad team player), are not as good as Giannis, AD, Jokic, and Embiid (to name the big men alone).    The early 2010s also included other all-NBA selections like David Lee, Goran Dragic, Al Jefferson, Zach Randolph, Joe Johnson, Tyson Chandler, etc.  Tony Parker and LaMarcus Aldridge made all-NBA teams virtually every year during this timeframe.  Again, all perfectly fine players, but none of them are anywhere near the players I mentioned, and none of them had any significant success as the best player on their teams (not even talking about success in terms of 'titles' but even 'winning playoff series').   &gt; Also the pace and scoring was also just much lower back then  I do think it's easy for pace and scoring to inflate our opinions of some modern players (e.g. if you took Zach LaVine's stats and put them in 2012 he'd look like the third best player in the league or something), but everything indicates that many of the guys I mentioned are having much more impact on their teams winning than, say, LaMarcus Aldridge or Kevin Love or Chris Bosh were doing in the early 2010s."

Goran Dragic that one game against the Spurs in the playoffs many many years ago. I will never forget how crazy that was.   Literally took over against the Spurs when the Big 3 were in their prime and straight balled out
"Los Angeles Lakers: PG Chris Paul (from Hornets)  New Orleans Hornets: F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets), 2012 1st from NYK via HOU   Houston Rockets: PF Pau Gasol (from Lakers)"
"like if anyone wants to complain about the CP3 stuff, really the only angle you can approach it from was that it was a bad trade.  &amp;#x200B;  Clippers package: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft, which was used to draft Austin Rivers. Upon the deal's   &amp;#x200B;  Lakers package: F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)  &amp;#x200B;  I wasn't really following at the time, but it seems like both packages weren't great. But i might favor the lakers package just for dragic."
Goran Dragic is getting older and nunn is most likely leaving. Heat have money and Dennis is a big upgrade
"The short-lived but fun **7-11** duo of Goran Dragic (7) and Dion Waiters (11) during the 2015-16. That was the HEAT team that went 11-30, then 30-11."
"That 2014 Goran Dragic year was the most fun I’ve had watching the Suns in a long time, this year excluded of course."
"People underestimate the impact of not having Dragic in the finals. We weren't just ""missing a starter"", we were missing the guy that makes things happen. Yes, Butler was spectacular, but he had to carry an even bigger burden then just the scoring and defense, but also having to be the primary ball handler.    I felt so bad for Goran to not be able to play, and help his team in the finals... Especially now that we seem rather far removed from getting another shot at it... Yes he played a game, but he clearly wasn't anywhere near his usual level of impact.   It would've been a 7 game series if we had Dragic."
"&gt;Before Stern intervened, the Lakers had reached an agreement to acquire Paul in a deal that would have cost them Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom, league sources told Yahoo! Sports. Under terms of the deal, the Lakers would have sent Gasol to the Rockets. The Hornets would have received Odom, Rockets guards Kevin Martin and Goran Dragic and forward Luis Scola, league sources said.  https://sports.yahoo.com/aw-wojnarowski_chris_paul_lakers_hornets_nba_120811.html"
Goran Dragic is the superstar of my heart
Duncan Robinson and Goran Dragic.  Robinson is 6’7 and Dragic is 6’3 on the court I thought they were similar height. Than i saw a picture of them shopping in a mall and the height difference was obvious.   Butler as well is 6’7 he’s always slightly leaning down or in a defensive stance when he’s playing so he looks Shorter than he actually is.
Goran Dragic came back from a 4 game absence due to injury ..... AD played every game in that playoff run.  Every player that plays significant minutes in playoffs is banged up to some extent. Doesn't mean they are injured. AD played above average starter minutes and didn't miss a game; he was healthy enough to do so.
"Lmao did you not watch the series, he was not healthy. Goran Dragic played in game 6, you think he was healthy that game? Hell no, he probably played through ridiculous pain that game"
"This is ancient history but the Chris Paul to the Lakers trade that David Stern vetoed would have been better than the package that New Orleans later got from the Clippers.  Clips trade: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a Minnesota 2012 first-round pick (#12 overall).  Lakers trade: Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, Lamar Odom, Goran Dragic, and a Knicks 2012 first-round pick (#16 overall).  Odom and Scola were past their primes, but both of them would later be traded for first round picks. Martin was a solid player and Dragic was probably the best player in either deal."
"you think a team wouldn’t have made the playoffs with Jimmy Butler, James Harden, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic as the core of your team? lmaoooo y’all Miami fans something else"
"&gt;i don’t care about garland being explosive as a leaper, he doesn’t need to be.  well, then you can take my point about JA's expllosiveness and move on, because you're just agreeing that he's not Ja level of explosive.    &amp;#x200B;  You don't care, but you spent all this time arguing that he can get to Ja's level.  so which is it?  &gt;he literally just needs to add 15 pounds over the next 5 years  which isn't going to work the way you think it will, lmao.  &gt;you’re referring to when guys say “yeah i gained 15 pounds of muscle this summer” and i agree that’s bs  it's not just that.  its also based on real times when people did come in with more muscle, but that isn't how explosivness works.  so much of it is genetic.  there's a million powerlifters who could out squat Nate robinson but very few of them will be able to dunk like that.  besides, what if tis all upper body muscle?  he jsut got better at taking contact maybe but it wont help him jump better, or take that first step better.  you're drawing stright lines that involve way too many assumptions that don't work out in reality.  15 pounds is a meme, even when they really did put on 15 pounds.  it almost never works out so cleanly.    &gt;but i am talking about somebody like Kyle Lowry or Goran Dragic who added some mass so they could better finish at the rim. Garland’s biggest problem right now is that he shoots like 2 free throws a game. in order to get that up to at least 6, i think he needs to add weight so he can better absorb contact  sure, but that still has nothing to refute my point that garland is never going to attack Giannis directly the way Ja tries to.  THAT is the difference.  Garland will break free from his man at times, but Ja has the potential to make a defender irrelevant in ways that Garland can't do at the rim.  and that matters.  i'll put it this way.  Chris Paul can still get to the rim and finish, but what he did before his knee was still a bigger threat than what he can do now, even if he can still juke almost anyone."
"i don’t care about garland being explosive as a leaper, he doesn’t need to be. he’s already plenty quick so he doesn’t need to get quicker or faster. he literally just needs to add 15 pounds over the next 5 years   you’re referring to when guys say “yeah i gained 15 pounds of muscle this summer” and i agree that’s bs. but i am talking about somebody like Kyle Lowry or Goran Dragic who added some mass so they could better finish at the rim.

"lebron and the lakers just won a bubble championship where they had a 4-month break before playoffs, and Damian Lillard, Westbrook, Goran Dragic and Bam were all injured. Does that ring count?"

"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- — Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother’s death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  “This win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,” Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  “We don’t deserve to win,” Butler said. “Whenever we take these teams lightly, we don’t do what we’re supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It’s not good basketball.”  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West’s worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn’t let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  “Tough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “Total team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.”  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  “That’s tough to overcome,” Spoelstra said. “That’s a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.”  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame “With Liberty and Justice FOR ALL” warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks – the previous two teams to play in Minnesota – along with the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves’ website during Friday’s game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"

"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."

He has that Goran Dragic energy from the Steve Nash era.
"the record for most all stars to miss a playoff game in a single postseason continues to rise and is now at 9, plus the players who have been playing with an injury.  this season isn’t the same as any other, and continually bringing up Goran Dragic and Bam as some sort of “gotcha” as if it’s the equivalent of this year is just pointless."
"As much as love Goran, I think Lopez for Dragic improves both teams"
"Here's a good chunk of them hanging out during the bubble.   &gt;[Among the group was his Trail Blazers teammate Mario Hezonja, Goran Dragic of Miami Heat, Nikola Jokic and Vlatko Cancar of the Denver Nuggets, Luka Doncic and Boban Marjanovic of the Dallas Mavericks, Nikola Vucevic of the Orlando Magic and Ivica Zubac of the Los Angeles Clippers.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)  &gt;[Nurkic is from Bosnia, Zubac and Hezonja are from Croatia, Vucevic resides from Montenegro, Dragic, Doncic, Cancar all hail from Slovenia, and Marjanovic and Jokic grew up in Serbia.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)"

Oh, I know why! Because of Bud's scheme. Still, most shooters at least miss some of their open shots. These shooters are literally hitting everything."
"&gt; You think fans are worse because you don't identify as an athlete,  i literalyl played soccer at youth level in brazil with huge crowds on multiple occasions, lol. the level of play was never as relevant to my personal experience as a bunch of grown man threatening to beat me and screaming (the most creative they could come with) personal insults 2 meters from me in the crowds. crazy, huh? playing against a huge hateful crowd gets the adrenaline pumping much more than playing against a top tier team in a library - simple as that.  &gt; Dude, I have professional basketball players in my family, I have known 30 plus d1 players, many of whom played over seas too. College arenas get as loud as those over seas one, too.  americans being excepcionalist and thinking their version of something is the most special, the most hardcore, the one with most pressure, lol. colour me surprised. and your version of the story completely ignores all i mentioned about how those players are coming into the league and europe, in their and their families countries, taking it completely seriously and professionally. nba players that go to europe are taking a downgrade / admitting failure, so from their perspectives, of course they are not going to see it as much pressure. and yes, ""not being good enough"" is a certain type of pressure, but that's not what we were talking about here - luka and giannis are not even close to not being good enough.   &gt;  there is no argument otherwise.  what a shitty way to end a reply, btw - specially since it's pretty fucking clear you are going to argue forever for the sake of arguing and make up stories about dozens of imaginary basketball players that played in europe and talked to you about this subject specifically, just not to give in. and you are a type too common on the internet.  and well, [argue with them](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1895785):  &gt; Nicolas Batum  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in France  I've played EuroLeague games where it gets pretty crazy. Serbia, Turkey, and Greece are the top three in my mind. My first NBA game, I had to play against the Lakers in Staples Center against Kobe (Bryant) - MVP Kobe. **Coach (Nate McMillan) was like, 'You won't be scared to play against Kobe in front of 20,000 people, will you?' I was like, 'Coach, I've played in Greece, in Belgrade … this will be nothing compared to that.'**  It's just different. The atmosphere is crazy. Panathinaikos, Partizan Belgrade, Fenerbahce, those places. The first EuroLeague game I ever played in Turkey, they had protection over the benches, and during the timeouts, while my coach was talking, all you could hear was things hitting the shield, like, 'bap, bap, bap.'   &gt; Bogdan Bogdanovic  Current team: Kings Played for teams in Serbia and Turkey  Here (in the NBA), there are lots of fans of individual players. **Over there, it's more about the teams. There are different cultures in every league in every country there. It's unbelievable. The fans there really take it personal, like they are in the games. They are really nervous and mad in the games like the players. But to me, that makes it nice to play there, even on the road. It's a different kind of pressure. You have to experience it for yourself.** For me, I'm used to it, so playing in a game where fans are throwing coins or lighters or phones is nothing new. Over there, it's normal. They're pointing lasers in your face while you shoot free throws.  &gt; Willy Hernangomez  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in Spain  When I was playing for Madrid, we had a EuroLeague game in Turkey. I'll always remember this: That I was warming up before the game, and I lost the ball, and it bounced and rolled all the way to the stands, and I remember, I didn't even think about going to get the ball like here (in the NBA). The fans there are really crazy. You really feel scared sometimes. There's no way here I would feel (scared) like that. The people there really support their teams and you have to respect them, but sometimes they also cross the line.  **There are some arenas here that are really quiet, you don't even notice people are there, so for us (who have played in Europe), not that the NBA is easier because you never want to say easy, but maybe getting used to the crowds there doing everything crazy, makes it easier for us to focus on the game here. Here, we don't even have to pay attention to the fans.**  &gt; Furkan Korkmaz  Current team: 76ers Played for teams in Turkey  **They will talk shit about your family, and not like here. About your mom, your dad, if you have sisters, they know everything. They will Google stuff about your family, and I was still really young when I played over there, so think how crazy that is.**  &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Current team: Knicks Played for a team in France  My craziest memory was the (2016) EuroCup final against Galatasaray. The away game in Turkey, I remember walking to the locker room before the game and the walls were shaking because the fans were already so crazy inside. We (SIG Strasbourg) couldn't hear our coach talking in the locker room, because of the fans in the arena.  &gt; Joe Ingles  Current team: Jazz Played for teams in Spain and Israel  Serbia and Turkey were always the craziest, but I remember in Greece one year, in Panathinaikos, someone threw a plastic cup of Coke at us during a timeout, and it landed right on our coach's whiteboard while he was drawing up a play. That's pretty funny, but it wasn't funny at the time. He was pretty mad, but what are you going to do? They don't kick people out for that stuff there or try to find out who did it.  One of my teammates, I don't remember if it was a lighter or a thick coin, but one of my teammates one year got his head split open from someone throwing something. But then there's a good kind of crazy, too. Maccabi (in Israel), where I played, no one was throwing anything, but to have 15,000 people love being such a part of the game, it was wild.  &gt; P.J. Tucker  Current team: Rockets Played for teams in Israel, Ukraine, Greece, Italy, and Germany  **There's nothing like Greece and Turkey. Israel's pretty turned up, too. But yeah, over there, it's not like fans. It's like gangs. It's like hoods. It's about where you're from, and they take it very personal. They love - love - their teams. When I was in Greece, I played for Aris, and when we played PAOK, I had to have a security detail, because it's a big, big rivalry in Thessaloniki. It splits the city. When we played, it got so crazy that they shut the fans out and we had to play a game (later) that season with no fans (in the arena).**  I played a game in Turkey where fans were lighting coins - like using a lighter to light the coins - then throwing them at us.  &gt; Goran Dragic  Current team: Heat Played for teams in Slovenia and Spain  I've played a lot of games in Belgrade and other places where if you're not careful, you can get hurt. They throw crazy stuff. I've been a part of one game in Olympiacos (Greece) where they threw oranges on the court. I never found out why. In Belgrade, they just throw coins and lighters. In Europe, most of the arenas, they put a protection, like a tunnel, behind the benches, so players don't get hit. When you're sitting on the road bench in Europe, all you hear is 'tick tick tick' - things hitting the tunnel. It's part of it. You get used to it.  One game I played in Croatia, in Zadar, and they have this organization of fans that are really crazy. We had an incident where one of our players got in a fight with a Zadar player, and these fans broke onto the court, and we just took off, we had to run (away) to the locker room in the middle of the game. I was only 16 at the time.  It's funny you know, over there, when you're on the road, you don't know if the security guys are with them or if they are going to protect you."
Always heard you don’t fuck with Goran Dragic
Dragic lol. Goran is his mentor
"Listen bruh, we all know that no one in the league wants any sort of smoke with Goran Dragic  Motherfucker might as well be the boogeyman"
"I suffered watching goran dragic, Eric Bledsoe, and Isaiah Thomas share the court for this moment"
Goran dragic also says hi
Goran Dragic tried to give him a run for his money last series.
"&gt; EDIT: Like what do you call Malcolm Brogdon, Terry Rozier, Goran Dragic, FVV, Dejounte Murray, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela  those are all role players lol, you can make an arbitrary separation between ""role player"" and ""role player who starts and has a bigger role"" if you want, but by all accounts they are still role players. Other than Dragic is there one allstar on that list?  By your definition, someone like Lou Dort stopped being a role player once he started and got the green light to take more than 9-10 shots a game. OG Anunoby isn't a role player because he starts and plays multiple roles on the court? A 3&amp;D player is basically the most sought after role player and that's a guy who can pass decently, drive decently, shoot very good, play defense very good. That's a multi-faceted player (Covington, Beverly, etc.) yet still a role player."
"&gt;Dude was getting downvoted  He was getting downvoted because what he said was stupid. The 9th place team in the West wasn't going to beat the Heat in a 7 game series. The Suns were led by Eric Bledsoe, Gerald Green, PJ Tucker, Channing Frye, and Goran Dragic. 2 bench role players, a borderline all-star, and 2 league-average starters."
"It's the playoffs and fan bases are supposed to hate the opponent.That's what makes this shit fun. I still haven't forgiven Goran Dragic for slapping Simmons in the back of the head like 3 years ago. Booing injuries is a bad look but that just fuels the animosity, and yeah with embiid it's tough because the dude does play through a lot of pain. And I agree with your last point. Still a lot of games to play but even if they drop out this round, Atlanta's future is bright and fans are going to start getting cocky, rightfully so."
"Crazy to think that Eric Bledsoe, Isaiah Thomas, and Goran Dragic all used to be on the Suns these days"
"And if you only play 1.5 months of playoff basketball after a 2 month break, that’s less wear and tear on the body, is it not?  I’m failing to see the difference between seasons where players play olympics/fiba and last offseason. Why are there not a slew of injuries in the seasons following those international tournaments? Goran Dragic played some of the best basketball of his career after he came back from leading Slovenia to that euro title.   I just don’t agree with “this can’t be a coincidence”"
"Idk if they still do it, but I remember when NFL network would show classic games featuring teams that were gonna be playing in a given week. I'd definitely be down for something like that.   I've been such an NBA junkie lately that I've been looking up classic games from the last 20 years or so, and then fast-forwarding to the last 5 minutes of the 4th quarter and watching the rest of the game. Last night I watched the end of Game 5 of Lakers/Suns back in 2010 when Ron Artest had the game-winning tip in. I forgot how much Steve Nash battled in that game. So many clutch shots in crunch time and in the end, Lakers still took the 3-2 lead in the series. And that game had a young Jared Dudley and Goran Dragic. Had a lot of fun revisiting that one."
"I’m not one of those fans who thinks he would’ve gone down as a legend or anything like that, but given the chance I think he would’ve been in the prime Mike Conley, Goran Dragic tier."
yep Goran Dragic is gonna win MVP next year lol
Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo
"Lol no, they were down 30 something with both Goran and Bam on the floor. My scalding hot take is the Lakers weren't prepped for a Bam and Dragic-less heat + Butler playing like prime Jordan and lost 2 games (and 1 of those was a wide open miss). They were badly outclassed"
"Vlatko Cancar plays for the Denver Nuggets. They we have some good role players. Zoran Dragic (brother of Goran)-he played in the nba for a while (Miami, Phoenix) but had a ton of injuries in his career (he was always considered as the more talented brother), Klemen Prepelic (elite sniper from 3 point range), Jaka Blazic (plays really hard-was always one of my favorite players to watch), Gasper Vidmar-kind of traditional center, but quite mobile (something like Valanciunas). These are probably the best players. Nothing to crazy, but these guys won the Euro when nobody expected that from them."
I’ve seen him on espn being hunted by an injured kemba walker. I saw him getting killed by goran dragic in the playoffs.  He gets killed off of switches.  &gt;no embiid in the west   Myles Turner fouled out in 3 quarters trying to play Dwight. Jokic would eat him.
"Better than KD, Luka, Lebron, Embiid, Jokic, Steph?  Simmons would need the shooting of like Goran Dragic or Kyle Lowry so that’s like 37-40% from 3 and a good midrange shot 80% from the line"
"&gt;ESPN  &gt;Mavs: C-minus  &gt;Knicks: B  &gt;Why (for Dallas): ""In today's risk-averse NBA, deals like this one sending out multiple first-round picks are rare. The last deal where a team sent multiple first-round picks without getting any in return came when the Miami Heat acquired Goran Dragic from the Phoenix Suns at the trade deadline in 2015.  &gt;""To be better than the max contract Dallas hopes to give him, Porzingis will have to be durable and effective enough to play at an All-Star level. I think it's much more likely that he falls short of that than plays so well as to be worth more than the max. As a result, I would have taken my chances with Smith's development, the picks and whatever else the Mavericks could have acquired by renting out their cap space."" -- Kevin Pelton"
Need a secondary shot creator and scorer. They could go after a Goran Dragic or Norman Powell and re sign THJ.
"still insane the kings passed on luka, literally had goran dragic saying he was gonna be an all time great when he was 18, euroleague mvp as a teenager, and u go with marvin bagley. not even a hindsight thing, kings fans at the time were throwing up when they saw that pick, itll never make sense"
"Marion, Grant Hill, Boris Diaw, Raja Bell, Channing Frye, young Goran Dragic... if I ever see those guys around the valley I will 100% treat them to a drink."
What do you think about Goran Dragic? He's the GOAT right?
"I can’t name one, but I’ve got a list: Clint Capela John Collins Goran Dragic Jusuf Nurkic Mikal Bridges Miles Bridges Garrison Matthews"
This is how I know this sub has goldfish memory and hive mentality and is just trying to ride this wave of shitting on LeBron. For the record I’ve been making fun of the lakers and lebron all night for this performance but the dude is literally going for a box out and y’all are acting like he should catch a case over it lmao. Find a new slant  Goran Dragic tried to rip Kris Middletons shoulder out of his socket a few days ago and barely anyone talks about but lebron boxes out hard in a play off game and you guys act like we should open a federal commission to investigate it
Goran Dragic Finals vibes.
"What if Chris Paul would've been trade to the Lakers? https://youtu.be/blhkMWa55dM  On Dec. 8 in 2011, then NBA Commissioner David Stern vetoed a three-team trade that would have sent Chris Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers.  It would have paired CP3 with Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles but it also had a lot of other moving parts. As per multiple reports at that time, here's a look at the players involved (excluding future draft picks) in the full deal between the Lakers, New Orleans Hornets and the Houston Rockets.   Los Angeles Lakers: PG Chris Paul (from Hornets)  New Orleans Hornets: F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)"
"It's tough because the game isn't quite the same as when Kenny played. I would liken him to Goran Dragic a little bit. He's a competent piece on offense, one who can score or distribute when you need him to. He's a slightly better shooter than Dragic, but not quite as adept as an overall scorer. They're both minus defenders, but they're both guys you'd want to have on a team as a No. 3 or 4 starter."
"I think Pau Gasol requested a trade from the Grizzlies and ended up in LA, but that's probably the only high profile one I can think of.  Maybe Goran Dragic, but he's not on the same level as the other guys."
"Yeah, I watched it, but don't start telling me you think guarding Harden, Kyrie, and Durant is the same as guardian Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn, and Goran Dragic."
"Addition by subtraction. You have TOO many like-players. Even worse it’s a combo of young guys and vets. So the young guys will naturally defer to older guys, and/or the coach will lean on the reliable older guys, when really the young guys should get minutes and a chance to shine and make mistakes. So along those line…  Put the ball in Tyler Herro’s hands. In the modern game, yea, he can run point. Similar to Jamal Murray. And similar to Jamal Murray, remember just a few years ago when Gary Harris(and to a lesser extent Will Barton) were seen as interchangeable with Murray? Harris was more stable, older, but Murray had the upside. Denver finally took off when that was cleared up.   For the Heat they have like 2 or 3 ‘Gary Harris’ guys. Dragic, Nunn, even had Avery Bradley. They need to trim some good players and give Herro big minutes. He is their highest upside player. I refuse to believe it was just the bubble. I think it’s the glut of guards, him deferring a little, him playing off-ball, and the fame overwhelmed him   Lastly, trade Jimmy Butler. As someone else pointed out, he has value to a contender. This is your last chance to get value for him   In my best case scenario for Miami:  -Trade Jimmy Butler to Atlanta in sign and trade for John Collins    -Let Goran Dragic walk, or sign and trade to a desperate contender for a projected late 1st (Philly, LA, Bucks)  -Let Ariza walk  -Let Iggy walk   -Sign Nunn on a friendly deal but do NOT overpay. He’s not THAT good. Move him to 6th man   -Re-sign Oladipo. Prove it deal   2021-22 Lineup  Herro   Oladipo  Robinson   Collins    Bam  6th man- Nunn  -Pat Riley and thr city of miami will be enough to sign the remaining guys. Your lineup is thinner, but you have better hierarchy and pathways for 3 guys to become stars (herro, Collins, Bam)  That ‘5 guys who average 15 a game’ blueprint has never worked"
Goran Dragic - not the Bucks
"Please, keep posting more Goran Dragic plays. You haven’t posted enough recently"
Dare I say fuck Goran dragic
Haha.  Fuck Goran Dragic though.
Fuck Goran Dragic
"Why is this so shocking to everyone? The Heat played Tyler Hero, Goran Dragic, and Duncan Robinson and made it to the finals last year. It's not so easy to just ""target"" someone unless the other team plays a religiously switching system"
"Didn't know Goran Dragic was black,played for the Knicks and wasn't a bubble guppie."
"They were missing Goran Dragic that series too, and he had been almost as important as Bam and Jimmy throughout their run"
Goran dragic is DIRTY!!
Spend half a decade solving Nash and fucking Goran Dragic gets you 🤢
fuck goran dragic
Can this please be our new thing? FUCK GORAN DRAGIC
"Coming soon to DVD from Walt Disney Pictures, it’s Bubble Boys starring the Miami Heat’s:  Jiminy Brickit  Bambi Adebafraud  Tyler Herro 6  Victor Oladeville  Dumbo Robinson   Kendrick Tron  Goran and the last Dragic  Dewayne Dedmon Tell no Tales  and Trevor Aladdin!  Join these lovable characters as they explore themes of Culture and Teamwork while facing off against the Greek Freak and his villainous team! Available on blue ray Summer 2021"
Fuck Goran Dragic that is some dirty shit. The fact he wasn't even assessed a technical for the stand over even after review is bullshit.
"I feel like Dragic has done stuff like that in the playoffs before.  Even the thing with Middleton, felt like a really normal box out by Middleton before Goran grabbed his arm."
Goran Dragic trying to fight Middleton after he hooked him is hilarious.
FUCK GORAN DRAGIC
can i get a FUCK GORAN DRAGIC?
Imagine rooting for a team that goran dragic gets minutes for LOL
"Goran “the Bitch” Dragic  That’s a helpful pronunciation guide, too."
Goran Dragic is a fucking bitch
FUCK GORAN DRAGIC
"yep, with a supporting cast of goran dragic, dewayne dedmon and 3 g league players in the playoffs"
"I swear a random rotational guard off the bench always goes crazy in the playoffs every year lol. Off the top of my head of the games I watched I saw Nate Rob, Aaron brooks, Beno Udrih, Goran dragic, Reggie Jackson, and patty mills win a game for there teams in a series."
playing like a prime Goran Dragic out there the fuck is going on
"You lost about 1/5th of your playoff rotations minutes, and thats factoring in the extended time given to Olynyk due to injuries. Ariza and Dedmon have replaced nearly a 5th (18%) of the total minutes.  Crowder was a big loss, but DJJ/Hill/Leonard/Olynyk played less minutes combined in the playoffs than Iggy did. The core of the rotation is the same - Crowder + Ariza/Dedmon.  Agree about the decline of Iggy and Goran, Dragic was amazing last year and it feels like his body is giving up on him a bit after all he sacrificed.  It's a big change for a team to go through but I think its more a combination of teams figuring out the Heat a bit more, and the decline of those two vets. It seemed a couple of weeks ago the Heat were getting it together but the disjointed season seems to have taken a bit of wind out of their sails."
* The rest of the conference got better. * They lost high level role players in Kelly Olynyk and Jae Crowder. * Goran Dragic declined because of old age/his finals injury. * Iguodala declined because of old age. * Tyler Herro declined because he didn't work on his game/body properly this summer. * Bam? * Budenholzer finally realized he could put Giannis on Butler.   They had a +3.0 net rating last year (7th in the league) and a -0.2 net rating this season (16th in the league). This team just isn't that good outside of Jimmy/Bam/Robinson.
"[Magic Johnson]: The Miami Heat need to play better! Specifically, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Trevor Ariza, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Goran Dragic, Udonis Haslem, Coach Spo, Pat Riley, their fans"
"Blake Griffin, Mike Dunleavy Jr., Kelly Olynyk, Goran Dragic, Mo Wagner"
"i mean he did it to goran dragic and to russ, and tried last year to do it to jamal when the nuggets reverse boomed them. its a pattern at this point"
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
"No, they didn't. Sources came out with Houston's asking price.  - Herro, Duncan, Precious &amp; Nunn (combined salary: $9,732,122) - Salary Filler ($31,522,798 worth) - Two 1st-Round Picks (miami only has their 2022/2024) - 4 Pick Swaps (legitimately did not have enough picks to swap)  That means mortgaging the future in two ways: the young players **and** the pick economy for 2-and-a-half years of James Harden. Not to mention that Miami's only way to create the filler would've been to trade Olynyk &amp; Iguodala for Harden at the last minute.  But fuck it, because *Oh please...* came so easily to you, here's what the roster makeup would've looked like fresh out of the trade, completely ignoring that we didn't have the picks or the swaps for Houston.  PG: Goran Dragic/Gabe Vincent (2-Way)  SG: James Harden/Max Strus (2-Way)  SF: Jimmy Butler/Trevor Ariza (who was acquired with a 2027 SRP + meyers)  PF: Nemanja Bjelica/KZ Okpala   C: Bam Adebayo/Dewayne Dedmon (f/a signing)  If you think **that** 10-man rotation does any better against the Milwaukee Bucks than the one we've pushed out there twice, you're completely out of your mind. Go Hornets."
Goran dragic gonna have a kid in a couple days and turn into god for the rest of the series.
Goran Dragic isn't changing shit about last year lol
"Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic   Dennis Schroeder, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert  Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic (this squad could almost be all big men)  # EURO SQUAD, ASSEMBLE"
Is Dragic gonna call out his teammate Goran Dragic in his post game interview
"I'm all about mocking the Heat culture thing, and I have been for the last hour. But one thing needs to be clear - Goran Dragic has no business playing in the NBA, he is a scummy fucking piece of shit."
Goran Dragic is a lovely man
"Oh man I looked up ""Plantar fascistic Goran Dragic"" and it turns out he ripped it."
"Right, and I totally get that the guys missing for Atlanta arent nothing but there’s also consideration for the idea that you have to expect a certain level of injury over the course of a season you’re never gonna have your full rotation go the full 82. Comparing their game log to Miami’s, Indy’s, or Boston’s (or even Brooklyn’s or Philly’s) you have Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Marcus Smart, Jimmy, Kendrick Nunn, Goran Dragic, Myles Turner, Malcolm Brogdon, Kyrie, KD, and Joel Embiid all miss  20% of the season (15 games) or more. That’s a lot of important guys from the East’s playoff picture and that’s not even mentioning what’s gonna happen next year when Toronto retools because that’s gonna be another set of stubborn motherfuckers if they don’t tear it down (which they 100% shouldn’t they have Nurse, FVV, and Siakam)  Props to McMillan and I think he’s earned an extension in Atlanta, I just don’t wanna see this team rest on their laurels by saying “hey, we broke in to the 5 seed” because when you put it into context against the rest of the East it’s a pretty tight arms race up for the end of the “contending in the East” tier"

It was close because Goran Dragic is a fucking ancient red dragon who's sole purpose is to protect his horde. Also Robinson hit a bunch of 3's when no one else could which helped
Cuban turned down Goran Dragic for free
don’t forget goran dragic becoming automatic
"Looked like Keljin Blevins compared to Duncan Robinson, Goran Dragic, and Khris Middleton"
GORAN DRAGIC IS CLUTCH
Ceiling- James Harden  Floor- Goran Dragic
Goran Dragic does not get enough credit
Goran Dragic is 35 years old and carrying his teammates
"Goran Dragic, defensive stopper???"
How you get locked up by Goran Dragic
The difference between this year and last years team above all else is Goran Dragic
"I mean isn't Jimmy supposed to be a tough guy? We're not talking about Goran Dragic guarding him here. But I digress, it's a legitimate play, just unsportsmanlike. Players should do what they think will help their team win."
Goran Dragic game 2.0
"Shaq too, I feel like he played with so many different teams and teammates. Just off the top of my head, the Magic in ‘92 I believe, can’t really remember how that team was constituted, to the Lakers with Gary Payton and Karl Malone and Robert Horry, to the Heat with Udonis Harlem I believe, to the Suns, they might have had Goran Dragic and Jared Dudley back then? Forgive me, I’m trying to do this without googling. Then you have that stint with LeBron and the Cavs, and the Celtics, who I think had Jeff Green."
"It's definitely a stat that needs context and &lt;gasp&gt; game-watching to provide that context. Look at some other names in the ""top"" 30 for players with highest TOV% and we see: Ben Simmons, Facundo Campazzo, Ricky Rubio, LaMelo Ball, Goran Dragic, Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, Ja Morant, LeBron James. What these guys all have in common is that they don't take many shots ***relative*** to how much ball handling they do. For sure a couple guys (Trae and LeBron especially) shoot and score a lot, but they do *even more* ball handling relative to their teammates."
"Kyrie was on a top of the line defensive team, hello? The 2017-2018 Celtics were literally the best defensive team in the NBA. They were better defensively than we were. Kyrie got exactly 0 MVP votes and couldn't make 3rd team over Oladipo or DeRozan. He was also the clear second fiddle kn the team behind Tatum to the point that Kyrie started sulking and demanded a trade.   Sometimes I think this gets overlooked so I just want to repeat it. Kyrie has made two All-NBA teams. Since his career began he was overlooked for All-NBA in favor of such superstars as Demar DeRozan (twice), Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry and Rajon Rondo.  At no point since 2014 has Kyrie been the best player on his team. The top 7 players in the NBA could all miss an entire season and he would still not be a serious MVP contender because guys like PG, Dame and Butler are just better than he is. Kyrie has incredible skill, but he's not an MVP level player."
Additionally Goran Dragic played a stint in Houston that seems like a fever dream.
"Trying to avoid the young guys like Jaylen Brown or Trae Young who will almost certainly get another AS nod.  C: Kristaps Porziņģis  PF: Meta World Peace  SF: Josh Howard  SG: Jrue Holiday  PG: Goran Dragic  &amp;#x200B;  Great defensive team. Okay spacing, MWP and Howard could both hit 3s and Holiday and Dragic are decent 3PT guys, All Star Porziņģis was a 40% 3PT shooter and averaged 23 ppg Dragic has shown he can be a 21 ppg guy, let him go off. Everyone on this team can shoot the 3, you have two ball handlers, a great rim protector in Porziņģis and elite defenders in MWP and Holiday. If healthy (big if with Josh Howard, and Porziņģis) this team would win 60+ games IMO."
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
"I'd take Ibaka's career over DeAndre Jordan any day. DJ was never that good when he wasn't catching lobs from CP3, and wasn't even a great defender besides shot blocking, which Ibaka was better at anyway. Only reason he was all NBA was because of how weak center was at the time. Easily the weakest all NBA first team pick I can remember. And 24 isn't that far ahead imo  Goran Dragic was the biggest steal from that draft, and it's not that close."
You mean like Goran Dragic who was on the team but injured?
Convinced that’s just goran dragic in a fake mustache
"Goran Dragic, Isaiah Thomas, Eric Bledsoe"
"If you like fundamentals...Goran Dragic.  However, if you are talking good looks...Goran Dragic"
"Slovenia. 2million. Produced Luka, Goran Dragic, Sasha Vujacic, Rasho Nesterovic, Beno Udrih. That's the better example"
"Beyond Jamal Murray a healthy Kemba Walker but that's alas a thing of the past and you saw how a diminished Kemba hurt Boston in this regard. Lowry would help in that he moves off ball better, has real gravity from 3(unlike Jrue) and is a better passer but still feels like they need a more creative dynamic scorer. Lowry is 80% 3s+layups for shit profile and not a consistent half court scorer as is.  But alas this is also the issue finding a guy to do all these things, and Lowry would still help youre right. If we're thinking lesser non all star versions of this guys like Kevin Huerter, Collin Sexton, Malik Beasley, Devonte Graham, Goran Dragic, Tim Hardaway. The only of those guys though who might even be remotely realistic is Graham, who will help but at some point if you can only shoot 44% at the rim that's so detrimental in a playoff setting it might just entirely cancel out whatever benefits he provides."
"It was a stupid trade offer for a 26 yr old cp3 who already had 4 allstars.  Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, Goran Dragic and a 2012 first-rounder? Stern was right.  Charlotte went on to draft KidGiltrest with #2,"
"We have no other ball handlers on our team. Go watch Luka play with the Slovenian national team (especially with Goran Dragic a few years ago), he's definitely capable of playing off ball.   Unfortunately, this Mavs team is poorly constructed, so Luka giving up the ball is a turnover most of the time."
"Who's talking about what those guys did before they got to New Orleans? I was addressing the guy saying it would have been a disaster for the Hornets if the vetoed deal went through. You can talk about how good the Clippers package looked on paper but in practice it was a disaster all around. Not one piece you guys got worked out for you. But if the vetoed trade had gone ahead you'd at least have ended up with a young Goran Dragic to show for it. That's my whole point, you can't say it would have been a disaster to get Dragic when we all now know how good he turned out to be."
"&gt;It is doesn't matter what happened to the guys they did or didn't trade for.   It absolutely does, especially if you're going to sit here a decade later and say ""it would have been a disaster for the Hornets"" to have got a young Goran Dragic. Can I sit here and say ""it would have been a disaster for the Celtics to trade away the rights to draft Markelle Fultz"" just because at the time everyone thought he was the consensus #1 pick and Tatum was a reach at #3? Of course not.  We have the benefit of hindsight now, we are allowed to use it, and hindsight clearly shows that the vetoed trade would have been better for the Hornets than the one they actually made was. Honestly it's foolish to try to argue otherwise."
You don't look back and instead wish you guys had got a young Goran Dragic instead? He turned out *way* better than any of the guys the Hornets ended up with. He made an All NBA team two years after this trade was vetoed.
"&gt; That was before Dragic was even that good lol. It would have been a disaster for the hornets.   Except that Dragic did become good, so it wouldn't have been a disaster for the Hornets. What *was* a disaster for the Hornets was the trade they actually made. Instead of getting a future All NBA and All Star player in Dragic, they got Eric Gordon, who proceeded to miss 173 games with injuries over his 5 years there, along with three underwhelming years of Al-Farouq Aminu, one underwhelming year of Chris Kaman, and the draft pick that became Austin Rivers, who was also quite bad while he was there.   They traded Chris Paul, an MVP candidate, for three totally underwhelming players and the rights to draft an underwhelming player. In retrospect I don't see how anyone can argue that they were better off with that package instead of the one that contained Goran Dragic, Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola and the 16th pick in the 2012 draft."
"His tenure with the Hornets/Pelicans was:  Year 1: 46 wins, took the 2-time defending champion Lakers to 6 in the first round; after season CP3 is traded away after a vetoed trade would have brought Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragic; instead the Hornets get Eric Gordon (the most despised player in New Orleans history), Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and a pick.  Year 2: Hornets finish last in the West with a roster where Marco Bellinelli and Greivis Vasquez lead the team in minutes. Gordon only plays 9 games. Hornets win the 1st overall pick and pick Anthony Davis.  Year 3: AD has an okay but not great rookie season, averaging 13.5 pts in 64 games. Minutes leaders are Vasquez and Ryan Anderson. Gordon misses half the season. Hornets finish with 27 wins. Pels trade their draft pick which ends up being Nerlins Noel for Jrue Holiday.  Year 4: They are now the Pelicans. I buy season tickets for $200/seat (seriously!). Jrue is injured after 34 games and misses the remainder of the season. AD has a break out season averaging 21 and 10, but also misses 15 games with injuries. Gordon misses 18 games. Ryan Anderson only plays 22 games. Hornets finish with 34 wins. Pelicans acquire Tyreke Evans in the offseason via trade.  Year 5: AD continues to improve to 24/10. Holiday misses half the season with an injury but the Pels still win 45 and grab the 8th seed, but are swept by the Warriors during their first championship run with Curry. Monty Williams is fired, and the Pelicans have made the playoffs only once since then."
"Was it really that lopsided?  Los Angeles Lakers: PG Chris Paul (from Hornets)  New Orleans Hornets: F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)  Houston Rockets: PF Pau Gasol (from Lakers)"
Goran Dragic lol.
what all 3? I don't care what the Bucks did in the East.  And seriously dude? Acting like GORAN DRAGIC and LOU WILLIAMS and a washed up Blake Griffin were some incredible hurdles? lol the East must be softer than I thought
It's hard to get over it when you go from Jimmy Butler/Goran Dragic --&gt; Harden/Blake --&gt; Trae/Lou Will --&gt; Booker/Paul all in one playoff run.
Slovenia is missing the best player from that team in Goran Dragic so its a little different
"Goran was really good for a time period. He's still solid.  Man I remember the Suns of old, Dragic, IT and Bledsie."
Is Goran Dragic not playing?
Why is Goran Dragic not playing?
Is that Goran Dragic out there?
"Except their ""usual club PG"" is Goran Dragic"
"According to [this interview](https://basketnews.com/news-153184-nesterovic-talks-about-doncic-leadership-dragic-role-and-building-a-national-team.html) with the Team Slovenia GM-equivalent (Rasho Nesterovic, you might remember him as a TWolves/Spurs/Raps C) Goran has retired from NT duties following the 2017 EuroBasket."
"Well for starters you have Fournier’s bird rights so you can go over the cap to sign him. So right off the bat you have Dame/Fournier/Tatum/Horford or Williams as your 1-2-3-5. Whichever of Horford or Williams doesn’t start playing most of the back up 5 minutes. From there you’d probably try to package TT and something for a starting PF. Maybe try to buy low on Lauri Markannen and send a pick Chicago’s way if there are any left. Then you’d still have your exceptions to fill out the bench on guys like Goran Dragic and Otto Porter. Idk, it’s not a perfect roster and you’d definitely lose depth but something like Dame/Fournier/Tatum/Lauri/Horford with Dragic/Otto Porter/Williams off the bench is a team I’d call a contender."
"I give magic the slight edge. Both teams kinda stomped their way to the playoffs until the finals. And in said finals one had to face the 87 celtics while the other had to go against the Heat with an injured Dragic, and a kinda healthy Bam and the ghost of Goran Dragic."
"Kinda makes me wonder how an All-Old team would look. Only taking folks from the oldest 20 players in the league, I’ve got:   PG: Chris Paul, Goran Dragic  SG: JJ Redick, Andre Iguadola   SF: LeBron James, Trevor Ariza   PF: Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap  C: Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol  Honestly, that’s not a bad team. I’d call it a second round exit, maybe conference finals."
Goran isn't. Dragan Dragic would be an interesting name though.
"Goran Dragic, but I think he retired from international play"
"idk Herro played amazing in the bubble, Jimmy was great, Goran dragic aged backwards a few years and they had a great defense. maybe a little worse than the suns but not alot"
GORAN DRAGIC
"McDonough was such an ass, he openly delighted in antagonizing great Suns like Goran Dragic. Crazy to think about."
"Also gotta shoutout to the later generation of that team, which a bunch are now the vets of their teams - Goran Dragic, Robin Lopez, Jared Dudley, Grant Hill, JRich, and Alvin G"
"Sexton’s absolutely been improving as a playmaker. Over the regular season, he averaged as many potential assists per game (9.2) as Lonzo Ball and Goran Dragic. Over the last fifteen games, he averaged the same number (11.5) as Ricky Rubio and Malcolm Brogdon did this season."
"Whoever wins the NBA finals, will not be the best team in the league. They won't have an argument for it. At full strength, both LA teams and the Nets are ahead of the other three remaining squads. The media is just now picking up on this now that both Trae and Giannis are hurt.   Go back through the every NBA title winner since 2000. Dallas in 2011 was the only teams where I look and go - not the best team or arguably the best team won. And the Mavs won that title because Dirk for 2 solid months owned every other star in the league and beat the bad guy Heat. So it's deserved. It wasn't Lebron and Wade being injured and Dallas winning.   The 2020 bubble under the circumstances is a title and a half. Let's not pretend Goran Dragic was going to swing the series in Miami's favor. The run of injuries this year will forever taint whoever wins this title. Good job, you survived but were not the best and may not even be top 5."
"[box score](https://www.fiba.basketball/oqt/lithuania/2020/game/2406/Angola-Slovenia#tab=boxscore)  Slovenia has Luka, but he only scored 13 of those points, which came from all 11 of their players who all got no less than 5 and no more than 16. This is pretty different from watching the playoffs.  Oh and that 16 was Zoran Dragic who, it turns out, is not just a regional spelling variant on Goran Dragic but a different pretty good player."
"Actually no. That would be Luka and it’s not even close. Second I would say Goran Dragic. Then Roglic (he’s way more popular than Pogacar; he also won the last two Slovenian athlete of the year awards). And then maybe Oblak? And I’m not really sure about it-I’m not saying he’s not liked or anything, but he’s not such an iconic athlete as Luka for instance. I could even make a case that some of our ski-jumpers are more popular than Jan. It’s easier to root for an athlete that plays an individual sport or in a club/franchise that plays in a league that isn’t that heavily represented with Slovenian athletes. In the nba majority of Slovenes root for Luka individuality-if he moves to a different franchise, so will the fans. But in Football everyone roots for their club. For instance I’m a Barca fan, so I don’t care that much for the overall success of Atletico Madrid (and Jan)."
"Goran Dragic, what a dirty piece-of-crap excuse for an NBA player."
"If your talking about Malcolm Bronson and Lonzo, replace them with Goran Dragic and Caris Levert"
Deandre Jordan  Goran Dragic (international competition though idk)  Hayward  Brook Lopez  Jeff Teague

"Nah, if the Knicks didn’t make the trade the Nets were going to instead.   Only reason the Nets traded for D.Will was because Melo fell through before their move to Brooklyn. Once the Nets went 12-70 missed out on John Wall and got the #3 pick (Derrick Favors) they realized they needed a “Star” player for their move to Brooklyn.   Nets had to deal with the “Melo-Drama” and then the “Dwight-Mare” shortly after when Howard was forcing his way to Brooklyn only to back out at the last second because he felt bad on the team plane surrounded by everyone.    “Dwight-Mare” led to the Nets in a panic sending an unprotected 1st in a shortened season to Portland to show D.Will they were willing to invest in the roster. That led to Portland drafting Lillard w/ the Nets pick.   Worst part of the whole D.Will era is the Nets were almost free from it in back in 2012.    D.Will was hesitant to sign his 5y/$98m extension and wanted to go home and play in Dallas all while training and rehabbing using the Brooklyn facilities.   Nets lined up Goran Dragic and were ready to cut their losses and move on. Dragic was amped to be on the Nets because Drazen Petrovic was a childhood hero of his. All of a sudden D.Will is given a ultimatum of either sign or leave the facilities and the Nets continue down a dark path. Dragic signs in Phoenix and gets traded to Miami later on.   What could have been in Brooklyn landed Melo and Howard instead or even Howard to pair with D.Will because you have to remember this was still while Howard was in his insane prime before the back injury in LA."
What major injuries benefitted us? Jusuf Nurkic and Goran Dragic aren't exactly my idea of playoff-altering injuries
"Who didn’t play three injured teams to get there and had a bench guy hurt. But nice comparison.  Goran Dragic is definitely at the same level as AD, Murray and Kawhi"
"I don’t think he has a lot of value. He’s older than most people think and isn’t a winning player. At best, maybe someone like Kemba Walker or someone on a similarly bad deal. I’m trying to think of playmakers because that’s what they need. Maybe like Goran Dragic. He’s not bringing back and all star."
"Goran Dragic might also play in case Slovenia qualify. Slovenia also have some really good Euroleague players so it's far from ""just Luka"" team. It is funny you mentioned how we have less people than the city of LA and yet somehow we are competitive in pretty much every major sport.  I don't see how would anyone beat USA on the Olympics tho. Maybe if they had a really bad night against France/Serbia/Slovenia (if they qualify)/Lithuania and even than they would be probably stronger in the clutch moments with guys like Durant and Lillard."
"Whatever, they never call it for him. Better than being dirty as shit like half of the heat lead by Goran dragic"
Goran Dragic in last year's Finals. :(
"I wouldn’t say Goran Dragic is G-League level, but also ignore my examples. Teams who beat or came close to beating USA at the FIBA World Cup"
South Beach Luka once Goran Dragic retires and joins the Heat staff 🥵
Yeah like they don't have the Jimmy butler or the goran dragic leading the team. Capela is the closest they have
"We also had Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic, and Isaiah Thomas on the same roster. Probably the greatest backcourt in NBA history"
Cam Payne's ceiling looks to be a mix of Goran Dragic and Leandro Barbosa. Maybe a 1x All-Star.
"Cameron ""Goran Dragic"" Payne."
Goran Dragic was the leading scorer for the Heat. Please watch games
"Come on dude, he’s clearly trolling. The Knicks are going to max Goran Dragic instead."
"OK, let me give you some hypothetical trades to illustrate my point.   1. Who says no to a trade where Miami gives Goran Dragic and Andre Iguodala in exchange for Ben Simmons? Dragic and Iguodala both have team options, so Miami could pick them up and trade them to Philly and the Sixers would get two pretty old players on expiring contracts and just get off of Simmons' salary. Are you telling me Miami says no to that?  2. The Sixers ask the Knicks to trade them Kevin Knox for Ben Simmons. This works because the Knicks have the cap space to absorb Simmons contract, even though Knox is only on a $5 million deal. Are you telling me the Knicks turn that down?  3. The Sixers offer Ben Simmons to Dallas for Willie Cauley Stein. Same as the Knicks trade, WCS only makes $5 million, but Dallas has the cap space to absorb Simmons contract. Does Dallas say no?  Clearly these are all trades where Philly is far, far more likely to say no than the other teams are. You're delusional if you think Miami, the Knicks or Dallas tells Philly they also need to include a 1st round pick or two before agreeing to those trades."
"The real question is what if every NBA player with the surname ending in “ic” just formed an Eastern European basketball squad go play against an iteration of Team USA.  You’d have Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Boban Marjanovich, Jusuf Nurkic, and Goran Dragic.  That in and of itself of NBA players is a ridiculously good team and would probably require the BEST American NBA players to commit to beat."
"His style of play is just exponentially more injury prone than a standard “Goran Dragic” esc point.  All the dribbles, cutting left and right, exploding out of awkward positions and his finishing moves like up and unders etc, leave him landing more awkward than the norm"
"He played really well in this series, big props to him.  That said, fuck that dude, dirty as hell and a total asshole. Made Goran Dragic look like Mike Conley out there."
"We probably would have to agree to disagree. I won’t discredit Spo for 2015 due to the fact that his 3 best players never played together at the same time, plus he had a wafer thin bench because McBob, Shawn, and Napier didn’t really pan out as expected, while they also had a liability at the PG position pre-Goran and their center rotation wasn’t really promising pre-Whiteside. Not to mention when the Heat got the Wade-Bosh-Dragic trio healthy for half of 2016 plus shored up their rotation with old Amare and Iso Joe they pushed the Raptors to 7. Also in 2014, I can’t see how the Heat had the better team on paper considering the Spurs won more games and only really struggled against the Mavs on their way to the Finals while we let the Pacers hang in 6 even though they had collapsed in the 2nd half of the season and Hibbert (the guy that gave us the biggest problem imo in 2013) had been all but neutralized by then."
"Do you consider Goran Dragic a star or a role player?  [Well, that might be your answer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLWjQ7nZTkI)"
Haralabob also declined getting Goran Dragic for free two years ago
goran dragic
"this is a just a dumb take of somebody who hasnt seen him for a long time and tries to find a narrative to stick. For those that have watched luka since his early real madrid days knows he has played off ball a lot in both real madrid with sergio llull, facu campazzo, etc and with goran dragic with slovenia when they both won a championship. Educate yourself before putting these dumb posts"
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
"Man, ""I wanna go higher"" and ""What are you doing, Goran Dragic?!"" are forever imprinted in my memory. DRose dunks and Stacey King calls were too perfect."
"They celebrated beating a cinderella Heat team without Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic lol. In a bubble where games were scrimmage level of intensity at times.   That was, and I don’t think I’m exaggerating, the worst team to make it to the Finals in the last 20 years. Maybe the Nets or Sixers edge them out, but definitely bottom 3. Insane the delusional Lakers fans that exist"
"So you can't attract free agents, but have an All-NBA player who wants to play for you, and your best move is to trade them for draft picks?  If you think whatever package the Heat/Lakers have been offering the past 2 years gives you a better chance than your All-NBA player, I don't know how else to proceed.  They should absolutely trade him if there's ever an AD/PG caliber offer, but the OP said they should have traded him 2 years ago... for what? Goran Dragic and Tyler Herro?"
PG - Goran Dragic  SG - Manu Ginobili  SF - Kris Middleton   PF - Rashard Lewis   C - Nikola Jokic
"We're fine right now roster construction wise for the season.     Fred/Goran/Malachi/Barnes   GTJ/Barnes   OG/Siakam/Barnes/Yuta   OG/Siakam/Barnes/Boucher   Birch/Precious/OG/Siakam/Barnes     the reality is we can use the depth at the guard position and that we typically like having two ball handlers on the court at the same time. Siakam/OG/Barnes are going to be rotating into several different positions.     The assets we'll get for Dragic is like a 2nd round pick and some trash, he's of more value to us on the roster, we aren't desperate for picks, we have all our own firsts and we have our own young guys that need to develop. There's no rush for us, we don't NEED the assets."
S&amp;T package for Goran Dragic? His market will be mid level exceptions at best.
"They’ve tried hard to sign non white stars and no one is interested in coming here. We swung and missed on Lowry, Butler, Beal, Kemba, Dwight Howard, Giannis, Kawhi, DeRozan, Conley, Grant, etc…   I don’t think it’s a conscious choice, we are signing players who are interested in playing with us, most of them want to play with Luka (Goran Dragic, fellow country man) or Lauri Markkanen who expressed interest in playing here. If Bradley Beal or Lowry had wanted to play here we 100% would’ve signed them."
"&gt; “Definitely,” Dragic said when he was asked if he’d like to play with Luka next season by Slovenian Planet TV. He more or less confirmed reports saying that Dallas is his most preferable destination, now that his run with the Miami Heat is over.  [source](https://www.eurohoops.net/en/nba-news/1235352/goran-dragic-says-hed-definitely-want-to-play-with-luka-doncic-again/)  I don’t expect a buyout to happen though, but maybe after the trade deadline it’ll be a possibility if he’s not traded elsewhere"
Goran dragic as well with his brother Zoran.
"Well I mean he was a rookie against the best playoff defense and they were missing Goran dragic most of that series, so I think his role became overbearing or just too much to handle. And if we’re going off most recent performances I’m not sure where that leaves the debate at personally. I think I would take Herro despite some of his struggles last year over a Divincenzo coming off a season ending injury, but it is close. I definitely see the value in Donte and why one would say he’s better, I’m just not quite there yet, but like you said it’s early."
I feel like people have already forgotten about C.J. McCollum. Kyle Lowry and Goran Dragic definitely gonna be forgotten.
I would go for Goran Dragic. Why? Becouse I played some school games in Slovenia when we were 13y and 14y. And I scored against him in the past. 😁😁
"Guys who made all star appearances that people will forget on sporcle quizzes: Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, Chris Kaman, Victor Oladipo, Deangelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, Julius Randle, Goran Dragic, and Roy Hibbert."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"&gt; who funnily enough got a much better package from the Lakers trade for New Orleans in hindsight to what they actually received.  Let's not even get into this revisionist history nonsense. New Orleans wasn't even getting the second best player in the trade. Pau was going to Houston.  New Orleans was going to get Lamar Odom, who was out of the league almost immediately. Kevin Martin who was a perpetual loser and never played a meaningful NBA minute. Goran Dragic who at the time was a backup PG getting less than 20 minutes per game.   The best player they were getting was Luis Scola who was 30 years old.  Compare that to Eric Gordon, a young SG who could score but was hurt sometimes, Chris Kaman who was hurt but an ALL-STAR just a year prior, Al-Farouq Aminu who was the 8th pick the year before, and what became the 10th overall pick?  It's not even a discussion. Can't let Lakers fans rewrite history and pretend like they offered the better deal."
&gt;depsite him having a hate boner for griffin. he might be right. cause they were desperate go get lowry but he dipped to miami like 3 minutes later and lonzo dipped as well  Every GM knew on August 1st that Lowry was going to Miami (days ahead of FA deadline) because they set it up with the Goran Dragic deal.  So Griffin knew he wasn't getting Lowry by that point. He had a lot of guards he targeted but none of them I think he was dead certain he was attaining.  kind of why JJ's accusation doesn't make sense.  Also Pels could get in trouble for the Garrett Temple signing in the deal.
Could’ve had curry maxey or thybulle and picks but y’all wanted precious and goran dragic that’s tuff
"Because most just say ""All Star"" if they've done it once but then normally 2x,3x, 4x, etc. if they've done it frequently.  Even though Goran Dragic for instance literally got his first all star appearance a few years ago and only because the prior selected All Star got hurt...he still gets referred to as an ""All Star"" because of it. No one calls him the ""One-time All Star"""

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"James Worthy,  Pippen (tho we did see him as the first option for 1.5 seasons),  Ron Artest (I'm biased tho),  Steve Nash (as more of a scorer),  Goran Dragic,  Manu Ginobli,  Rashard Lewis,  Jamal Murray,   and Michael Beasley (for a tanking team)"
"My main change would be to change the way we look at international contributions. I think they should be considered as pluses for guys with already stellar (but borderline) HOF cases, like Manu with his gold medal or Marc Gasol with his silvers, but we do not need guys like Toni Kukoc and Vlade Divac stinkin’ up the Hall.  I’d make an exception for guys whose primes occurred before the NBA started becoming more global in the 90s, so guys like Sabonis and maybe Oscar Schmidt could still get honored, but if you came to the NBA and didn’t at least make a few All-Star teams and ideally an All-NBA team or two, then I don’t think you should be in the Hall of Fame.  In my opinion, the point of the Hall is to honor the best players in the history of the game, and I’m sorry to all the Eurostans, but excelling in a lesser league in Europe does not grant you that honor if you’re not able to keep it up against the tougher competition in the NBA.  I’m dreading the day when I see headlines about guys like Goran Dragic making the Hall of Fame, or worse, guys who completely couldn’t make it in the NBA like Milos Teodosic and Jan Vesely getting into the Hall, all because they racked up a bunch of accolades against lesser competition."
Tampered to get Goran “I don’t wanna be here” Dragic
*Sigh...*  Goran Dragic
"Or Goran Dragic, the guy who is trying to get out of Toronto"
We’re a world class organization regardless what happens. Goran fuckin Dragic isn’t gonna change that.    “I was gonna sign with the raptors… but you remember how they didn’t trade goran to the mavs? Yea you know what on second thought…”   You guys are corny af.
"Spicier Translation: Goran Dragic isn't my preferred teammate, I have higher ambitions, we'll see"
Time for Cuban to complete his dream team:   Goran Dragic   Luka Doncic   Maxi Kleber   Kristaps Porzingis   Boban Marjanovic
"The team never said anything though, that's the distinction.   It's clear both sides want Dragic traded. Raptors are trying to do that behind the scenes and that's what's being reported.    It'd be just as unprofessional if Masai said in a press conference to say he wanted Goran gone."
“Goran Dragic is not our preferred backup guard. We have higher ambitions.”  -the largest NBA fan base and NBA Champion Toronto Raptors fans who watched their team win an NBA final. Unlike the one you lost in 2020… oh and you have somewhat of a rep for playing dirty.
"enjoy your rebuild years, son  Goran Dragic on his future: ""Toronto is not my preferred destination. I have higher ambitions. We'll see.""  LMAO"
And Goran fucking Dragic is not gonna help us get there either lol feeling is WAY mutual little dude
"You can’t just say YoU dOnT wAtCh HiM to everyone who disagrees. He’s crap on offense everywhere besides from 3P territory, I just don’t think he is very versatile at all offensively. Doesn’t board, distribute, get to the stripe. He’s much better defensively than Dragic of course though he’s good on that end. And he sure is a good shooter too just think he’s too offensively limited to be better than Goran  I watch plenty of basketball u don’t know who I watch lol. I’ve probably watched more Trent than you have cause I watched more western conference prior to this year and Trent had what like 20 games with Toronto?"
"“And last but not least, fuck Terry Fox.” — Goran Dragic"
"Goran is not a positive asset at that contract.  If you're talking about Akiuwa, that's fine.  It's the Lowry-Akiuwa trade.  Let Dragic go."
"Fuck The Weeknd, Fuck Kiefer Sutherland, Fuck free healthcare, fuck Justin Trudeau, fuck Justin Bieber, fuck Shania Twain, fuck the Property Brothers, fuck Jim Carrey, and fuck Ryan Reynolds bitch ass too, you hoseteasers! - Goran Dragic."
“I don’t wanna be here” - Goran “Eric Bledsoe” Dragic
Is there anything else that may have been missed from the interview before the section that was tweeted?  https://www.24ur.com/sport/kosarka/napovedi-so-se-uresnicile-goran-dragic-odhaja-k-torontu.html
"I agree, he's not an all star level guy whose going to move the needle for every team, but he would move the needle for certain teams that are in need of another ball handler. Dallas only has Luka facilitating the offense and desperately needs another ball handler.   Dallas probably makes it past the Clippers last year with Goran. He'd probably only be our 5th or 4th best player, but it would alleviate the need for Luka to do everything. It would give Porziņģis someone to help set him up, and provide some offense/ball handling when Luka sits.   We took the Clippers to 7, who eventually went all the way to the WCF. Dallas with Dragic maybe wins in 7 or less, and then faces Utah and Phoenix."
"well imagine from moving to beautiful miami to cold af Toronto and being Goran Fuckn Dragic, dude is a boss should get to play whereevrr the fuck he wants"
"I mean, he isn't gonna bother suiting up for Toronto anyway, so it is no surprise that you don't care what the front office does lol. My point being that letting a dude waste away on your roster without trying to get something back is *dumb*.   Dallas is simply hypothetical, but for arguments sake let's keep them there. If *every* contender (and fuck, every non-contender too) knows that Dragic (age 35) doesn't wanna play in Toronto and would prefer a trade to Dallas, then why would anyone other than Dallas make a reasonable offer? If another team saw him as that missing piece, there would be a bidding war between Dallas and this other team to see who could give the best offer. But that's not reality, and also not what is currently happening as per reports. The only outcome left in this scenario is to just bench him until his contract is up and allow him to walk for nothing, which is as stupid as it would be petty. If Masai thinks he can get something better, than he should go for it! But in this context, it is *highly* unlikely imo.   It's not so much as doing Goran a solid as it is just cutting to the chase. That being said, I dunno any of these dudes, so this is all pure speculation"
"just take a deep breathe, and remember that this is Goran Dragic who said this"
"Yes, to the first sentence. No idea what the next has to do with anything.  Goran Dragic is barely an employee. He is a contractor who makes the revenue of a medium capital business by himself. But we can get past the bizarre notion of comparing a 0.1%er to yourself, and focus on the crux of what you're saying:  if my employer were in some bizarre industry where it was common to transfer people without their consent (and which would have been specified in the massively lucrative contract I'd signed) and they asked me to move branches, I would have the decency not to publicly announce to the world that I have ""higher ambitions"" than working in branch X after the head of that branch publicly spoke about how happy he was to have me there."
"Dude, like I said, that's absolutely fine. Lol we know that, it's not a new thing. We just went through it with Lowry lol how do you not see that? Most of the fan base doesn't even  want him because he is gonna take minutes. But he isnan asset an under contract, he is not gonna walk for free.  And our GM said publicly not 2 days ago that they spoke to Goran and he was happy to come, so you think Dragic would have a bit more tact.  This is classless however you slice it."
"I dno if you noticed but his value ain't high and this doesn't help.   You really think Masai is gonna let Goran dictate terms? Why would we buy him out?  Aside from helping Dragic give me 1 even decent reason for us to do that and not have a veteran guard here? He isn't some star who gets to call shots.  Yeah it's a business and Goran is under contract here. He doesn't have to want it, that's what makes it a business.   And AGAIN, it's cool he doesn't want to be here, he doesn't have to parade it on TV."
"There’s a trade somewhere on this thread that was proposed by a mavs fan. They swapped out the first for Burke, is that more fair in your eyes?  I can understand not dumping too much for a 1 year that may sign with you guys. But I thought that was pretty reasonable. Really the only asset you give up is terry plus you get off Powell  Honestly I like the mavs with dragic over every other team in the west. I think KP will move better a year removed from injuries, and y’all were seriously lacking shot creation which I think goran would help with. I think the lakers are gonna be way worse than this sub thinks. Most of their depth won’t be playable imo  Not sure why all those mavs fans are being such tools"
"Because he’s obviously in a less visible position than Goran is. Masai can do his thing without anyone bothering him, Goran is basically a celebrity who gets asked tons of questions to the media. I don’t see why there’s a holier than thou mindset here on Dragic just saying he’d rather play somewhere else when it’s completely obvious"
Toronto cant acquire the young socialite ben Simmons nor the Slovenian savage Goran dragic. Drake needs to step up and put them on the map again
“Goran Dragic is not our preferred backup guard. We have higher ambitions.”  -Raptors fans
"Masai ain't gonna bend to appease Goran Dragic LOL. But I do understand what he's saying. He's older and the Raptors are re-tooling, so he'd prefer to go somewhere else. Cuban and Nico better ante up then."
Goran dragic maybe lol
 New teammate Goran Dragic. Just give up the pick…
"Damn this dude is trash, pistons should just trade him to a shitty city nobody wants to be in like Toronto for example. Pistons can have the much better Goran Dragic."
"Luka Doncic, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Lauri Markkanen, Kristaps Porzingis with Boban Marjanovic as the sixth man. Cuban has clocked his game."
I’m ignorant can somebody inform me why goran dragic didn’t play for them in the olympics?
Imagine getting punished for acquiring goran dragic in a sign and trade
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."
Can I interest you in Goran Dragic instead?
Jimmy butler came here when our best player was fringe all star Goran Dragic and we made the finals
"For me it's Goran for Aaron Brooks, after all we hyped Dragic to be the successor of Nash we kept doing the man dirty"
This is where Goran Dragic could have tremendously helped this team. Someone to calm to youngins down and get them into their offense.
Same here! I only just realised Slovenia has Goran Dragic on their team 🤯 so nervous!
"Raptors for Goran Dragic, Precious, and a first"
You can lose one (like Monte Morris) and a draft pick or two for Goran Dragic
"I dont understnad why teams would be clamoring for goran dragic either, statistically he's been worse than dennis schroeder for the last few years.   League average 3 point shooting, bad at 2 point shooting.  Below average defensively, and he's 35 and not going to get any better.  His assist production has declined every year since he left phoenix  Really the biggest value he has to anyone is the mavericks cause he can be buddies with Luka  Marcus morris is a much more productive player and he's an important part of the clippers"
Dragic adding some steadiness to a bench unit lead by Flynn and Barnes is pretty nice. They get to play a little loose and still contribute and goran can play with the starters if they wanna go small. Dragic did a similar thing his second year and helped Phx get to the wcf
"Precious wasn't even in the discussions from what I remember, it was Dragic, Olynik, Duncan, and Nunn.   *“Miami expressed interest in acquiring Raptors six-time All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry and Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk and Kendrick Nunn were discussed,” Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype reported recently.""*  https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/miami\_heat\_have\_made\_a\_kyle\_lowry\_trade\_offer\_to\_the\_toronto\_raptors/s1\_12680\_34352972"
Goran will rot on the bench and they will develop their young guys. Toronto had no plans to use whatever cap space with what Dragic not being there would free up so it's whatever for them.   They'll flip Dragic when it makes sense. They probably won't buy him out unless they know they can take advantage of that space.
He’s extremely smooth on ball. Shades of Goran Dragic.
"I feel like Toronto has already agreed to the Miami part of the deal, so I don't think Miami is involved in this anymore unless they are assisting in finding a destination for Dragic. Between Dallas and Toronto, the Raptors have all the leverage. Toronto can just wait till the trade deadline when playoff teams are looking for that final boost and get a solid return for Goran."
There’s no hard feeling between Dragic and the Heat.   Source: Goran Dragic
Can I interest you in a Goran Dragic?
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
"Yes, they also announced the trade for Goran Dragic and precious now they're going back to what the sources said.....3 days later !!!  You may be technically right but Toronto could have Swifty nip this in the bud, they didn't it looks like they couldn't find the right offer for Goran but that still makes raptors look bad to agents and gms."
"Im seeing this on my phone so it’s kinda small, was that on Goran Dragic?"
Why didn't Goran Dragic take that last shot
dragic isnt even dragic. lol  This is Goran Dragics brother Zoran Dragic. Goran the nba player retired from international game.
I'm so conflicted as a raps fan. Do I cheer for raptors legend Goran Dragic or raptors legend Nando de Colo?
&gt;I’d go with Goran Dragic though.  Dirty piece-of-crap player. Good inclusion.
"That dirty bitch Dwyane Wade.  As much as other players annoy me like Lebron or Lowry whining to the referees, it's players that have actually tried to injure players on my favorite team. Wade did just that when he pulled down Rondo in a non-basketball play and [*dislocated his freaking elbow.*](https://youtu.be/he4OY6gJNX4)   Goran Dragic, Grayson Allen, and - shocker - Kyle Lowry also come to mind when thinking of guys that have made dirty plays against the Celtics. Fascinating that there's a common thread with THREE guys listed in my comment.  (hint: it must be HeAt CuLtUrE)"
&gt; there may very well be a fifth team involved to drop off unwanted salary  Can we interest anyone in a Goran Dragic?
"Wiggins homecoming? Raptors get Wiggs and Paschall. Warriors get Dragic, Baynes and second round pick(s)  Warriors depth chart:  |[](/GSW)|Starters|Reserves|3rd string| |:-:|:-|:-|:-| |**C**|James Wiseman|Kevon Looney|Aron Baynes |**F**|Draymond Green|Nemanja Bjelica| |**F**|Otto Porter Jr.|Jonathan Kuminga|Juan Toscano-Anderson| |**G**|Klay Thompson|Modey Moosy|Jordan Poole| |**G**|Stephen Curry|Goran Dragic|  edit: Raptors just waived Baynes. Nevermind"
"The trade wasn't ""Miami gives Precious Achiuwa and Toronto gives Kyle Lowry"", it was ""Miami gives Goran Dragic and Precious Achiuwa and Toronto gives Kyle Lowry"". Dragic is essential for the money to work, and, since the deal isn't officialized, literally nothing is stopping Toronto from just refusing to eat up Dragic's contract if we don't accept their terms.   Achiuwa would be the compensation if Miami had cap. They do not, so they need to offload Dragic to Toronto. Toronto can refuse to take Dragic if they want. It isn't rocket science, Miami needs Dragic on the trade and Toronto will accept it only with a 3rd team involved. No 3rd team, no Dragic. No Dragic, can't sign Lowry."
"What’re people’s opinions on Goran Dragic not playing for Slovenia   If I was Slovenian (I’m not) I would see that as kinda weak, low key. It’s not like the U.S. where they have a deep bench to draw on and a bunch of gold medals already in the bank. This is definitely his best chance to contribute to an Olympic medal for his country—it’s not a crime to take a pass and focus on his NBA career, but I gotta raise my eyebrows a little."
"Multifacted IMO:  * Genetics: Players recruited internationally are commonly big men, like centers, or physical specimens with an obvious physical advantage. Like an Embiid type, yes amazing player but what made him stand out at an early age was his size and speed and that was his ticket to America. Like look up and down every NBA roster, 70% of big men are internationals. In this sense.. China is just at a disadvantage.  They're just statistically less likely to produce tall, long wingspan, fast dudes and that's a statistical fact. They will not get into the NBA via a 1st round pick AKA large guaranteed money.  * Skill positions favor Americans: Players like Tony Parker and Goran Dragic are exceedingly rare: international players with no obvious physical advantage, at skill positions. I think as a ball handler or play maker, a lot of the game is mental and requires a sense of leadership over your team. Your English has to be good. Your relationship with your teammates has to be good. If you put an overseas guy who speaks no English and has no charisma, and give him 30% of the possessions to make plays, that's a tough ask. The scouting has to be extremely good to understand this type of prospect and honestly I think the vast majority of guys like this are missed, whether in China or Europe.  * Combine the two above: China isn't a country that would produce physical specimens in general.. of course Yao and Zhao Qi exist but as a generality, I'm saying. So they're not going to produce an obvious physical prospect that can play off-ball and would be given extra rope to develop. Fine, maybe China could produce a great skilled on-ball player, a guard or a forward, however I believe that because the level of play is lower in China and because of a language barrier, that guard or forward never gets elite reps at a young age and never becomes a floor general at an NBA pro level.  * They won't accept less money: Looking at Ding Yanyuhang's performance in Summer League a few years back, he probably could have gotten a two-way deal or a minimum deal tops if he didn't get injured, and honestly seeing as he was two time CBA MVP at the time in a country that is surely paying him well, I would just question if he would accept such a demotion.. we'll just never know if he could develop into an NBA role player because no one will ever try, there's other guys than just him. Would like to see some more of them in Summer League."
This. Possibly with the addition of Moses Brown. No way we’re trading Josh Green for a 35yr old Goran Dragic.
"Lukas desire to play with Goran was never a problem but hardest part of this is deal with Toronto. I also like idea to sign someone Slovenkan team to minimum in Dallas. For example, Prepelic or Zoran Dragic."
Everyone always says Karl Malone but they totally ignore Kevin Johnson who did similar things.   I’m not trying to advocate hate but it’s weird how he keeps going unnoticed. Like people lit Billups up jut because he got a HC gig but Kevin Johnson did all that and was still mayor of Sacramento.   I’d go with Goran Dragic though.
"Heat culture = playing dirty and disguising it as a hustle play, word to Goran Dragic."
A team of -ics would be nasty tho  PG: Luka Doncic SG: Bogdan Bogdonovic SF: Bojan Bogdonovic PF: Nikola Vucevic  C: Nikola Jokic  6th man: Goran Dragic   A bit wonky in the frontcourt but great shooting from all 5 positions and great passing overall.
"Fair enough. Thanks for looking into it. While I don't agree with some of your reasoning, I can't deny the % stats.  Are you familiar with 2017 European Championship? Have you actually seen any of the games? Not that I'd expect you to, just wondering, seeing as you're still somewhat doubting this Slovenia team is for real. I would assume had you seen those, you would be more reluctant to write them off. That run was every bit as unlikely as this one, if not more (other than potential finals vs USA), and they pretty much dominated.  Slovenia vs France (no Gobert, but a great team otherwise): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47dfXNcnUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47dfXNcnUU) (domination in a blowout)  Slovenia vs Latvia Quarter-Final (vs Porzingis, before he was a bust): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-DKtLy9S1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-DKtLy9S1M) (this nail-biter is a must see for any Doncic fan, and a really fun game overall)  Slovenia vs Spain Semi-Final (against 4 years younger Gasol brothers, with a 4 years younger teenage Doncic that has since come a long way): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVSMQQ23b60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVSMQQ23b60) (domination in a blowout)  Slovenia vs Serbia Final (with Doncic hurt with 5 minutes to go in 3rd): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJH6c1oKztE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJH6c1oKztE)  I'm not here to convince anyone, I'm really just debating with people who I disagree with, so I am not posting this to convert you or anything, but rather because I think it's something many Americans are not aware of and would probably find of interest to see, especially since this was Luka before NBA, taking a back seat to Goran Dragic while destroying the basketball empires of Europe.  I'll leave this here as well:  Slovenia vs Lithuania - Olympics qualifier Final, a month ago (vs Jonas Valanciunas and Domantas Sabonis): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTb8CwRp-lc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTb8CwRp-lc)  My prediction: 95-84 Slovenia (unless it's a blowout, which I don't expect, there will be fouling in the end, probably inflating the advantage by some 6 points)"
"2020 finals - bam adebayo, Goran Dragic injured for the heat. Whatchu gon say about that ?"
"There were three players over 33 who played significant roles on this years playoff teams: Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Lebron. They all had injuries in the playoffs. Goran Dragic, Carmelo, Joe Ingles, Gallinari were probably the next most significant contributors over 32 on playoff teams. Dragic had injuries late in the season. Gallinari had a playoff injury. None played over 30 minutes a game and closer to 20-25 minutes.   The list of guys 33+ who play 30+ minutes deep into the playoffs is a very short list. Lebron, Chris Paul, and Kyle Lowry 2 years ago at 33 are it really in the last few years.   The Lakers are going to have to be really smart to distribute the minutes. Teams are giving too much to some of these older guys in my opinion (not the Lakers necessarily since they’re 1 year deals mostly). We’re going to see some teams stuck on some contracts for guys who fall off the cliff."
Y'all interested in a lightly used Goran Dragic?
"""Why wouldn't you just sign Goran Dragic at a discount"" because he is under contract for 19 mil next year Bill"
Well that’s your opinion. I think anyone who thinks Lowry is only a slight upgrade from goran dragic doesn’t know basketball.
"That’s because he was supposed to be guarding Bledsoe, so effectively had free reign to float around making everyone else’s life difficult because Bledsoe wasn’t gonna punish it. Terry Rozier and Goran Dragic looked top-tier defensively in that matchup too.  That’s not to say he isn’t actually good or anything, but that’s definitely not the example to use to make your point."
"Steven Adam's has a incredible season shooting 47% from 3 on 7 attempts per game, leading the pelicans to the finals along side zion and Ben Simmons after a blockbuster 7 team trade. They then lose in game 7 vs against the Raptors lead by Isaiah Thomas, MVP fred vanvleet, and FMVP Goran Dragic. Lebron retires, Ben Simmons retires, and Richard Jefferson comes out of retirement"
"Either Sam Dekker or Goran Dragic probably, even though both seemed to increase their stock with the fanbase"
"[Woj] Sources around the league tell us Luka Doncic is trading Kristaps Porzingis to the OKC Thunder for a 2nd rounder. With the free space, the Mavericks intend to sign Crancar, Prepelic and Tobey. Sources also tell us Luka Doncic is closing in a deal with Masai, where Goran Dragic would be traded in exchange for Mark Cuban's Shark Tank."
"Give them Goran dragic, vanvleet, and two picks to the raptors."
Goran Dragic + Chris Boucher for Simmons is going to be Masai's next fleece job
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J. Tucker (36) * Chris Paul (36)  **Bench:**  * Kyle Lowry (35) * Jeff Green (35) * Goran Dragic (35) * Andre Iguodala (37) * Dwight Howard (35) * Rudy Gay (35) * Carmelo Anthony (37)"

"Yes. He goes there instead of the Clippers and the whole league would be different to this day. New Orleans would have gotten Kevin Martin, Goran Dragic, Luis Scola, and Lamar Odom. I'd say that is a better package than Kaman, Gordon, Aminu and a pick.  I mean, just the teams involved, Lakers, NO, Clippers, Rockets, would be impacted, but it ripples out. Bynum's bum ass probably never gets traded to Philly, all those draft picks going to those teams over the years would land differently. Maybe there is no ""process."" Kawhi lands on the lakers because the timing works out. Who knows, man."
Blessing? Who the fuck is Goran Dragic compared to Kyle Lowry? Lmfao
"Jersey retirements aren’t about stats it’s about the players importance to the franchise. Goran dragged us through the post Bron era and kept us fun to watch while being the ultimate professional no matter what and it cultivated into a finals appearance, Dragic is a Heat legend and should have his jersey up there next to Haslems."
"That year the Suns had Bledsoe, Goran Dragic, IT and Brandon Knight. They made Knight the starter. The Suns to this day owe the fans and those other 3 names an apology."
I know people like to shit on frank but he’s actually a nice fit next to Luka I don’t know why you are being down voted..?  He’s alright at playmaking and is good at defense   Who’s the best guard frank has played with? Tim Hardaway? Trey Burke? Courtney Lee? Derrick Rose last year? Luka is going to be all of the offense of this team and a player like frank fits the mavs future better...  the mavs need to punch up the rest of the roster  A 23 year old Ntilikina fits much better skill set and timeline wise with 22 year old Luka than 35 year old Goran Dragic....
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
I went with two quick examples. My point being players don't suddenly just stop improving at a default age or season. Richaun Holmes is another late bloomer. George Hill had his best year at age 30. Goran Dragic didn't really impact the league until his 6th year. Plenty of instances
Dream: Goran Dragic  Reality: Frank Ntilikina
"Goran Dragic, Steve Nash, Dirk, James Harden, Kawhi"
"Toronto is going to surprise people.   Being back in Toronto with actual home-court-advantage instead of 72-road games and Floridians booing at every game will help to a degree. No more Covid craziness will also help seeing as Toronto probably had it worse than every other team except Boston. Then having a full year of Trent Jr and Birch will provide depth and the additions of Scottie Barnes, Goran Dragic and Precious should shore up what was a terribly shallow rotation last year. Look for OG to take the biggest leap, VanVleet will explore a larger role with Lowry gone and Siakam will look to bounce back after a down shooting year. Nick Nurse is still a top coach and the Raps pull random contributors out of their ass annually.   New York however, is going to regress.   I don’t see All-nba for Randle again. They should see some progression from their young players but overall I think they just got lucky in a weird season last year. Once fans were back in the stands for the playoffs they shrunk exponentially."
"But Dragic was leading in scoring for most of the playoffs run. And most recently, he got outscored by Bryn Forbes in a playoffs series, who is a serviceable shooter and typically 8/9 man and didn't play the rest of the playoffs. Butler continues to be unbelievably overrated for bubble play, in which there was a season interruption, break, abbreviation and ultimately the most unorthodox playoffs of all time in being self Contained, no travel, no fans, no home court. And he was getting outscored by the aging Goran lol"
Goran Dragic and fillers
Steve Nash's team is also great:  * PG: Steve Nash * SG: Kobe Bryant * SF: Vince Carter * PF: Dirk Nowitzki * C: Shaq  2nd team:  * PG: Jason Kidd * SG: Joe Johnson * SF: Shawn Marion * PF: Pau Gasol * C: Dwight Howard  3rd Team:  * PG: Kevin Johnson * SG: Michael Finley * SF: Ron Artest * PF: Dennis Rodman * C: Amar'e Stoudemire  4th Team:  * PG: Goran Dragic * SG: Michael Finley * SF: Josh Howard * PF: Antawn Jamison * C: Chris Kaman  5th Team:  * PG: Tim Hardaway * SG: Nick Van Exel * SF: Hedo Turkoglu * PF: Danny Manning * C: Shawn Bradley or Juwon Howard
"This probably doesn't count, because he ended up becoming a 5 year / $86 million player. But in 2010, Goran Dragic was a 2nd year, 18 minute per game, 8 ppg bench player.   But he ended up having [this game](https://youtu.be/LLWjQ7nZTkI) against the Spurs in the playoffs."
"That may be, but is I would argue that, because there weren’t a lot of guys on that Heat roster that are at that hyper elite, Giannis, LeBron, Steph, AD level as there normally is, that the difference between our third best player Goran Dragic that year, versus our 7th or 8th best, Iggy, isn’t that huge. That was just a really good, really deep roster whose 3rd through 8th guys are really close to one another. That said, I’d admit that Robinson, Crowder, Herro all played a bigger role. That said, it was a pretty ancient Iggy, but he certainly filled a lot of gaps for us, as Crowder did."
Precious Achiuwa and Goran Dragic
"Bro, seriously? You got fans of teams offering Malik Beasley and Goran Dragic and you're telling me you wouldn't even want to entertain a discussion for Jamal Murray or Chris Paul?"
"What? So if you’re in an especially rough conference you’re not all star level ? Whether you get an extra 100 votes for all star determines how good you are as a player ? By that logic Roy Hibbert, Mike Conley and goran Dragic are better co stars than CJ, Fox, Shai, Ja, etc   Ignoring that criteria, again CJ has outplayed or matched dames play in like half their shared series..."
"Sixers pls, let this man turn into donovan mitchell east.  my god we’re getting goran dragic arent we"
Goran Dragic struggled his rookie year and I remember fans calling him Goran Tragic .
"that suns team was loaded even if a few of the guys were past their primes: steve nash, jason richardson, amar'e stoudemire, shaq, grant hill, throw in boris diaw, goran dragic, robin lopez, matt barnes, raja bell, and jared dudley. not to mention stromile swift!"
first glance I thought they used an image of Goran Dragic
"Dragoc was great in 2020, big reason we make a Finals push. Last year Dragic was not very good. Kyle will 100% be an upgrade. And even id Kyle takes a step back he provides defensive ability that Goran never could or will provide.  Prior to 2020 Dragic was underrated for that point in his career. Now it seems everyone is overrating him. That injury from the Finals has slowed him down."
"Ooof, this one hurt. God I miss young D-Rose and those Bulls teams. Still watch the dunk over Goran Dragic at least once a month."
"Doesn't have to be one player.  Young players don't have large contracts, draft picks are a thing.  You are over thinking this bud.  It's Goran Fuckin Dragic"
Goran Dragic. . . .
"It's crazy how much /r/nba eats this stuff up. Reporters don't always have the full picture of events - I can totally see some Mavs source saying ""we expect Goran will be bought out"". But unless that's coming from Toronto, there isn't news here.  Something new here is that Toronto tried to get some teams involved with the Lowry S+T and got nothing. However that doesn't suggest they're unwilling to play him (as Dragic hasn't requested a trade yet)"
Goran Dragic
Goran Dragic?
He would be a better version of Goran Dragic
"&gt;Butler was marginally better than Goran Dragic  Well I know no one actually would believe this.  Someone caught up in people's nostalgia of Rose is just amnesia towards  what an abomination his series vs Miami was was throwing away winnable game after winnable game down the stretch. One of the worst series from a ""top 5 player"" youll ever see historically."
PG: FVV  SG: Gary Trent Jr.   SF: OG Anunoby   PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Khem Birch  Bench:  Goran Dragic  Malachi Flynn  Scottie Barnes  Chris Boucher  Precious Achiuwa
"man I find it really hard to believe someone can think this  Butler was marginally better than Goran Dragic, Rose was a very clear 1 option albeit yeah not efficiently"
Chris Boucher Goran Dragic and a couple picks and Possibly throw in FVV depending if we get a pick back
Fuck a reputation. We won a chip and have an elite FO brother. He’s knocking us down to 97/100 here. No one gives a fuck about Goran Dragic in the grand scheme of things.
"""Hey Scottie, I know that you and Masai and Nurse have great relationships and they're offering you a 4 year deal, but ***remember Goran Dragic***."""
Never believed the buyout thing but Dragic himself literally said he wanted to play with Luka so I’m inclined to believe Goran lol.
ya it was Jake Fischer of Bleacher Report with the original report.  https://twitter.com/JakeLFischer/status/1432352026382454785  later Jake said that Goran Dragic is gonna be bought out. as a Mavs fan obviously that interests me. ppl were shitting on it saying that it's bullshit and he's not reputable.  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pgqion/jake_fischer_on_goran_dragic_all_my_sources/  so in one story ppl are saying that he's reputable and in another ppl are saying that he isn't. interesting isn't it?
"The people I’m replying to are saying Goran will be bought out because the “owners” are telling Masai they want to save the money.  And again you’re making my point, Goran could be bought out because Masai believes the player isn’t worth the money, Michael Friisdahl has no idea if Goran Dragic is worth the $15 million. And Masai was promoted and is empowered, to make the decision as to whether or not he is or isn’t.   And I’m not arguing semantics, I’m explaining the power structure of MLSE. That’s the entire point, I’m not arguing whether or not Goran is worth the money, or whether he will/will not be bought out. My only point is how that decision is made, and Cynthia and Michael do not factor into that decision.   Those two are not telling Toronto FC which players are good and worth contacts, then ringing up Shanahan on the other line and telling him that Mitch Marner is overpaid and needs to be traded, then Zooming into a player personnel meeting for the Argonauts and telling them they need to get to $50,000 under the cap instead of $20,000 by cutting kicker Donald De La Haye because he didn’t get enough Rouge’s 2 years ago"
"The only real reason they might do it now instead of waiting until the deadline is that the Raptors might value the open roster spot over keeping Goran around.   So instead of 6 guys (Ish, Dekker, Gillespie, Binga, Yuta, Svi) competing for 3 spots you have an extra spot by buying out Dragic. Meaning you'd only have to cut two guys after camp"
" &gt;Why not wait into the season and play Dragic to up his value? It's not worth the risk. If he goes down with an injury they won't be able to trade him at all. So it really limits your ability to make any sort of move.   Even if we don't play him, why would we just buy him out and not do like what the Grizzlies did with Iggy? you're acting like trading immediately or playing him or cutting him are the only options with a gun to Masai's head that he must move immediately.   And RN I doubt we make a significant trade but if we do Goran is a big expiring that is an asset for a team that might want cap room next season (not sure what the major FAs are next summer but still). You're mentioning that we should buy him out because of his cost this season to ownership but if we let him expire even and it would get rid of the salary instead of stretching it, so why not just rip the bandaid off instead of prolonging it?   &gt;Worth noting too that Dragic and Luka have posted about them working out together this wek.  Yeah and players working out all the time doesn't mean their team is going to suddenly waive them to go play with their buddy"
"Again, I said arguable, I'm starting to think you aren't grasping the concept of the word. Goran &gt; Butler was never the point of my comment, I was merely answering OP, who asked why Goran got the contract. Additionally, arguable literally just means that you can make an argument for/against the claim. You can argue Goran was their best player in the first 3 rounds due to his ppg, apg and usg%, additionally he drastically improved his midrange game and in the paint scoring during their playoff run, compared to his regular season numbers. Prior to his injury, Dragic was a plus-45 in 33 clutch minutes, which led all players in the playoffs at the time of the stat. Goran showed up when it mattered during that run and had a huge leap from his regular season production.  Butler was also quoted saying: ""That’s my guy….I’m glad that he’s on my team, he’s so smart, doesn’t care about stats, just wants to win. I think everybody overlooks that, but he’s huge and he has been all year….he’s our leader.”  I'm not trying to get in an argument about who was better. My point was that he was great during their playoff run, enough to be debated as their most important player through the first 3 rounds. I'm sure all teams would take Butler of Dragic, but Dragic was arguably their most important player in the playoffs up until his injury.   OP was asking why he got that large contract and I was merely offering reasoning."
"You are fully aware that Jimmy and Bam both had significantly better advanced stats than Dragic did in the playoffs, yes? Goran could score and pass, and that’s about it. Jimmy and Bam did a lot of other stuff way better than Dragic did, and your opinion is wild as hell."
"Uhhh, in what world did Goran fucking Dragic have a case as the best player on the 2020 Heat? Jimmy was far and away the best player on that team, and Bam was second."
Here's the comparison of what Hornets would have gotten  &amp;#x200B;  |Lakers|Clippers| |:-|:-| |Lamar Odom|Chris Kaman| |Goran Dragic|Eric Gordon| |Luis Scola|Al-Farouq Aminu| |Kevin Martin|2012 FRP (Austin Rivers)| ||2 2nd rounders|  How is the Clippers deal better?
I hope Masai is happy with his massive sign and trade return of…..   Goran dragic. I know raptors fans on reddit are thrilled. It sure was worth it.
"Goran Dragic, leave him in Slovenia Toronto doesn't want him"
"we have 1 slightly used Goran Dragic and 1 Chris Boucher, take it or leave it"
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"Mavs fans went from ""Maybe Giannis will come"" to ""Kylie Lowry is our target"" then it was ""Goran Dragic is friends with Luka, thats a no brainer"" and finally ""We called Markannen a poor man Porzingis but maybe between the two of them, we got a decent starter""  Now they are left with writing articles about how we should have trusted their old players all along."
"Used to wait on Goran Dragic weekly at one of my old restaurants. Dude always came in a hoodie and always ordered ribs. The first time I waited on him I was just stopping by the table to introduce myself and I stopped mid sentence and was like are you goran dragic!? He quietly said yes. He was with his bombshell of a gf at the time who is now his wife, but the game had ended like less than an hour ago so it was weird to see him already at the restaurant. Anyways, very polite and nice guy, tipped 20%. Have also waited on Rashard Lewis back when he was on the magic, Yao Ming, Rafer Alston, Avery Johnson, Clyde Drexler and his family a ton, Tony Romo, Charles Barkley, Reggie Miller, Nas and Slim Thug. No one tips like Slim Thug tips though, and he’s the nicest guy you’ve ever been around. Barkley and Romo were absolutely smashed drunk and fun as hell though."
"Nice of you to ignore that Gordon was injured and but not that Odom would be unmotivated.  Gordon and Odom would've cancelled each other.  Both were unexpected.  The 1st round picks cancelled each other.  Austin Rivers amounted to nothing.  But Kevin Martin, Luis Scola and Goran Dragic far outweighed the rest of the Clippers bounty."
Ok.  The Hornets would get:  Lamar Odom   Kevin Martin   Luis Scola   Goran Dragic    and a first-round pick   That's still much better than what the Clippers offered.
"Those Cavs teams for that era were actually very solidly built. Fantastic defense and good shooters. They just lacked a tried and true second option.   Of course those options were available in the draft via Danny Granger, Al Jefferson, Goran Dragic, Millsap-in the second. Then the big one Amare Staudemire the year before LeBron was drafted. That team was very much so was one piece of the puzzle away from finals appearances in 2008-2010. Yes even 2008 against the Celtics Big3  a tried and true second option gets them over in a game 7."
"It would have been a 3 team trade between Houston, Lakers and New Orleans:  **Los Angeles Lakers: ** PG Chris Paul (from Hornets)  **New Orleans Hornets:** F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)  **Houston Rockets:** PF Pau Gasol (from Lakers)   The trade with Clippers that was accepted:  **Los Angeles Clippers:** Chris Paul  **New Orleans Hornets:** Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and the Timberwolves’ unprotected pick in 2012 (ended up being 10th, Austin Rivers)  I’m not sure that was a better package. I kinda believe the story that other teams whined about Lakers getting their man again, and that is why Stern blocked it."
"Honestly our full squad is nothing but sick names. Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Pascal Siakam, Freddy Vanvleet, OG Anuonoby, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Nick Nurse, Yuta Watanabe, Delano Blanton, Goran Dragic. even Scottie Barnes is kinda cool  Definitely top 5 team based purely on cool/unique names"
"Yeah. Because a good agent would have told Dion Waiters to his face, “You’re complaining about Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic getting more minutes than you instead of blaming the guy you see in the mirror who is an out of shape creature who consumes shady edibles.”"
"How 1 is a playmaking defensive pass first guard, 1 is Goran dragic, and the other is a shoot first guard that plays the 2 a lot"
I'll never forget that we drafted Goran Dragic and then we let him go to Phoenix so he could score 40 points a game against us in a sweep
Goran dragic lol crafty white combo guard
"In addition, it was Alvin Gentry who took D'Antoni's system and improved it by holding starters accountable on defense and developing the bench: Goran Dragic, Barbosa, Dudley, Amundson, and Collins."
"I traded Goran Dragic for TJ Warren and TJ McConnell  Then I traded Siakam and FVV for KD, Blake Griffin and a FRP   would recommend."
"I wish the Pacers would trade some front court talent for Kings PG talent. I feel like any of the Kings guards could potentially be an upgrade for the Pacers. The Kings remind of the Suns team that had Goran Dragic, Eric Bledsoe and Isaiah Thomas. It’s just too many dudes back there."
"I 100% agree. It was really cool seeing the league totally copy hardens moves. it was obvious shit was gonna change when u see Goran fucking Dragic flopping on screens to get 3 fts lol.   The cool part was how it seemed like 1 guy figured out how to just change what basketball looked like (in a negative way for a lot of fans, but I skip free throws on league pass lol).   If the league wasn’t 100% in the superstars pocket, and they actually reffed with parity, I think it’d be way less frustrating. Like it’s not hardens fault that they’ll actually call that bullshit lol"
"&gt;the first trade really didn’t have any blossoming young talent, that’s what the Hornets needed, pieces for the future  Goran Dragic is still playing in the NBA today! He wasn't 22 but he + Kevin Martin + Luis Scola is a way better trade than Eric Gordon and Al Farouq Aminu. Eric Gordon was overhyped as hell, imagine Devin Booker before last season's playoffs. THAT'S NOT THAT GOOD OF A PLAYER AND YOU'RE TRADING AN MVP CANDIDATE.  Again, the injury concerns were also there."
"What the hell? No.  The trade for Chris Paul would've netted New Orleans...  1. Lamar Odom, after he played his best season and won 6th man of the year 2. Kevin Martin, a young 20 point scorer 3. Luis Scola, who was above average at PF 4. Goran Dragic, who was good enough to help lead the Suns to a 50 win team  Bro that's a near playoff team, add 1 mid tier lottery guy and the team is pretty good. Some of those guys were expiring contracts, which was ALSO good, because back then, a guy with an expiring contract was gold for teams that wanted to play in the Free Agent market.   Okay with that said, Stern vetoed that trade of multiple good players for...  Eric Gordon, who was constantly injured and had some injury concerns prior to the trade, also was mostly empty stats on the Clippers.   Al Farouq Aminu, a project player who was BAD when he was in New Orleans and made himself into a journeyman.  Chris Kaman, who was close to washed.  ABSOLUTE MADNESS -- THE ONLY ONE OF THESE PLAYERS TO MAKE AN ALL STAR TEAM AFTER THIS WAS IN THE OTHER FUCKING TRADE HE VETO'D."
"One that's kind of interesting is really anything to do with the 16th pick last year.  The Heat gave it up to get Goran Dragic from PHX, Phoenix used it to trade Zhaire Smith and it up for Mikal Bridges from PHI, Philly used it to trade for Tobias Harris from LAC, and LAC used it as the premier pick with Shai and Danilo for PG.   Also, the Gerald Wallace deal for Dame"
Will trade Goran dragic for BOL BOL
goran dragic will never win DPOY
"Pretty much. We have only two players in the roster that can create for others: Brunson (and he is really a SG that works best as a secondary creator than someone to play pure point) and Burke (which isn't good, but he *can* make passes).  Everyone was screaming all offseason to bring in a secondary playmaker to spell Luka. Up to this day the mere mention of Goran Dragic spikes a civil war at r/mavericks. Apparently everyone BUT the Mavericks FO thinks Luka needs someone other than Brunson to spell him.   I would kill to have Delon Wright back to run the offense off the bench."
Goran Dragic
Goran Dragic.
They just need Goran Dragic and they'll win a chip

Heat culture is terrible for older players because it’s so physically taxing. Father Time is undefeated. Razor fine line between staying in excellent shape and running an older beat up body into the ground. I’ve also never witnessed a Euro player thrive in the Heat system besides Rony Seikaly (probably before the true culture was instituted) &amp; Goran Dragic. The rest have folded.
"In fairness he used to be cheap.  Young Joe Johnson was a perfect fit alongside Nash with his defense, size, shooting and iso ability when 7SoL down but they traded JJ to Atlanta when he hit restricted free agency.  Luol Deng, then the seventh pick in the draft, got traded for a second round pick and cash.  They traded Isaiah Thomas at the deadline before he hit free agency and Goran Dragic in part to dump the Brandon Knight deal.  I don't think Sarver is being cheap right now, I don't think Ayton is worth $40 million plus luxury tax payments, but he has earned his reputation and I have little sympathy."
"Scottie Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Montresz Harrell, Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry"
Toronto should need cap space in order to sign Ayton. We'll take Goran Dragic from you guys in order to help the war effort.
"Dragic and Nunn didn’t start together and Duncan Robinson definitely isn’t a guard. But if that’s what you really want to get stuck on, no dramas.  Giannis vs. Chris Paul in the Finals: 32 possessions, CP3 shot 12/24 for 28 points with five assists and three turnovers.  Giannis vs. Trae Young in the ECF, 16 possessions, 14/3 w/ 1TO on 5/11 shooting.  Giannis vs. Goran Dragic first round, 15 possessions, 6/0 w/ 2TO on 2/6 shooting.  Giannis vs. Westbrook in the regular season (the guard he defended for the most possessions), 39 possessions, 7/8 w/ 3TO on 3/8 shooting.  I can keep going if you’d like, that’s just last year. Matchup data is pretty spotty but I’m sure I could pull out a lengthy highlight reel of him guarding small guys if that’s your preference."
"I mean, if we’re talking defensive metrics,[Lowry](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kyle-lowry-defensive-rating) has the better career [defensive](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/goran-dragic-defense-rating) rating, and a[better defensive rating](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kyle-lowry-defensive-rating-rank-last-five-years) over the [last 5 years](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/goran-dragic-defense-rating-last-five-years). (Defensive rating is better when it’s lower btw, just in case you didn’t know.) Also, if you’ve watched any substantial amount of Lowry playing basketball and think he’s a bad defender than that says a lot more about you than it says about him. I still think you’re trolling though. I hope at the very least."
Not Sexton related at all but this (presumably same) anonymous scout also thinks that [Kyle Lowry wasn’t an upgrade over Goran Dragic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/q8v0s3/anonymous_scout_isnt_a_fan_of_the_miami_heat/) so I don’t think they’re the most credible source
"He averaged more potential assists per game than Lonzo Ball and Goran Dragic last year, and about the same as Jamal Murray. If the rest of the Cavs could actually hit open shots, his assist numbers would be a lot better."
"I think lowry is clearly a big upgrade. That being said, I do think anyone comparing the current heat to the bubble heat need to take into account that they're replacing goran with lowry, not just adding lowry. Dragic was the heat's leading scorer before the finals."
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"
"Really? Because in the last 5 years, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, D'Angelo Russell, and Goran Dragic have all been All-Stars. Point guard defense is greatly overrated. Westbrook and Harden have won MVP's while playing almost no defense. Dame is considered a top 10 player while being a bad defender."
"I met Goran Dragic in his PHX days! I was at a rundown Target shopping for some boardgames and just saw him walk by me. Had to do a double take and he noticed me looking at him with excitement. I mean look at my username I'm a huge Suns fan! He was with his brother Zoran and his GF. After a little while of me trying to be sneaky he just came up to me and said hi and we talked for a minute. His brother offered to take a photo of us which I took him up on.   I was also going to the game later that weekend and let him know.. to which he very very humbly said ""that means so much thank you for support"".  He was very nice and humble. Which is why I hate how dirty Ryan McD ran him outta PHX. Will always have a special appreciation for Goran!"
"Look, I don't care that much one way or another, but let's be honest. He was the 4th best player on that team after Butler, Bam, and a supercharged Goran Dragic. Crediting him for that run as if he has the same responsibility or role that those other guys is just disingenuous and silly. Herro is in the same conversation as other elite 3rd/4th options at best until he is the best player on his own team.  Swap Herro with any of those other guys mentioned and the Heat get better and the Hawks/Mavs/Grizz gets worse, especially in the pre-Lowry era during the bubble run."
"A series where he was the 4th best player on the team (after Jimmy Butler, Bam, and a resurgent supercharged Goran Dragic)"
"Yeah no offence but I ain’t going to come to the conclusion that Goran Dragic is on the Raptors cause some guy with the first name Shams said so. It's absolutely possible he is but he could very well be on the Mavs. We just don't know, not you, not me and not fricking Shamantha that's for sure. Only ones who actually know is Dragic and maybe some guys on his team/organization."
Horse shit. Dude was a prodigy. Goran Dragic been talking in interviews for years about how he’s never seen anything like it. Luka’s innate basketball talent is unique even for an NBA player. He’s literally like 1 in a billion.  It’s like saying you can just drill your way to being Steph. Steph ain’t the best shooter ever just because he worked harder than everyone else.
We were a much better team than you last year. We replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier. You replaced Kyle Lowry with Goran Dragic.
"Truthfully, every single player on the Raptors is talked about. OG, Yuta, Boucher, FVV as the primary handler, Scottie, even some deeper guys like Banton and Flynn.  So I'll throw one out there. People have 0 expectations, literally 0, for **Goran Dragic**. Mostly because his contract's bloated, and he didn't want to be there. But to outperform expectations? Dragic just has to show up, period.  But he's in the twilight of his career and people think he's cooked. He's going to work, and show the world he's worth another contract. A small one, but he'll have a decent role for Toronto and he'll do just fine for us."
Goran dragic scoring 23 in the 4th vs the Dynasty Spurs.
"I can ask for James Harden while trying to trade away Goran Dragic, if he actually gets traded for Dwight Powell it doesn’t mean I went from Harden to Powell"
"I think the raptors have the biggest draw. The raptors develop anything and treat people with respect.   It's a big city with media stars like drake. Jb and the weekend pulling up from time to time.   Trade Fred vanvleet , since he's a versatile scorer and decent passer avg 6 assist. With Chris boucher , Goran dragic for Phillies draft pics next 2 years and Tyrese Maxey, Isiah Joe rookie too.   I say by November when the raptors have a slow star when they realize pascal siakam isn't the  the first option type of guy but a co star."
3 team trade  Raptors get: Al Horford  Utah gets: Goran dragic  Celtics get: Donovan Mitchell
Bum give him to us for Goran Dragic and a 2nd rounder
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"An even crazier one:  At the end of the 2012 season, Andrew Bynum had been the Lakers full time starter for 4 years. He had two rings and was coming off a 2nd Team All-NBA season with 19/12 averages.  At the same time, Kyle Lowry had fewer than 140 career starts and was competing with Goran Dragic for minutes on a mediocre Rockets team, re-Harden.   Since that point, Lowry has made 6 All Star teams and won a championship. Bynum played a total of 26 more games and hasn't played in almost 7 years.   Lowry is 19 months older than Bynum."
"&gt; You mean fucking Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo? They’re not even all stars. Nobody expected even a fully healthy heat team to win that series  Alright, you lost me. But I'll humor you.  &gt; Again, the Lakers lost AD and Bron for a significant amount of the season. That helped the Suns to be the 2nd seed and regular season success doesn’t mean they’re destined for the finals.   The Suns are the reason the Lakers lost 32 games? We only played you 3 times.  &gt; The Lakers took a 2-1 lead when they had both AD and Bron (not 100%) on the floor.   When they had CP3 (not 100%, not even 50%, not even 25%) on the floor.   &gt; And you suns fans like to pretend that CP not being 100% is comparable to Bron AND AD being injured.  You lakers fans like to pretend that CP not being 100% = CP being 100%.  &gt; Again, you’re comparing CP to Kawhi which is another false equivalency. Clippers would’ve beat the suns if Kawhi was healthy, too.  No, we don't know that. Especially because of how the Clippers rallied AFTER Kawhi went down, all the people who stepped up failed to do so beforehand in the Mavs series and the first 2 games of the Jazz series. I will admit they should be favored healthy. But it doesn't matter because *we knew the team we were getting when they cooked the Jazz*. ""But Kawhi"" is blaming US for the injury as if we're the one who tore his damn ACL lmfao. Flawed and lame ass argument.   &gt; Even with the suns not “perfectly healthy”, they lost to the first relatively healthy team they faced.  They were in the fucking finals? They were playing the last best team standing?   &gt; They dodged superstars every round of the playoffs   I want you to seriously explain how a team can control superstars -- injury prone superstars, mind you -- going down before they even played us. We just played who was in front of us. You frame this like we went and tore Kawhi's ACL ourselves.  &gt; choked as soon as they got their opportunity to win it all.  That's what happens when you play an all-time great player who clicks with his co-stars at the right time. Credit to the Bucks who outplayed us. We also were only outscored by 2 points per game average in the series, so framing it as a beatdown is disingenuous. Just dripping with objectivity. If you want to actually make an argument, don't overexaggerate to the point where a simple bball reference google will disprove you.   &gt; they beat better teams because they lucked out on injuries... we’ll see what this suns team really is, which is a team definitely not getting out of the west.  Better teams would have been better in the regular season and would have been better in the postseason. West is wide open once you take off your hater shades. You say your team retooled and has a superteam with depth, I say your team has no continuity, didn't address any injury bug concerns, is only getting older, and your three stars are a poor fit. You're still one of the two favorites to win the title, and all I can do as a fan is use stats and history to challenge that. I already wasted time addressing your shitty recycled takes, I doubt I even remotely changed your mind on anything. Most of you Laker fans just lie over and over again with enough loud voices until you believe it's the truth, as if we all can't actually go watch the games with our own eyes."
"Lol it’s ironic that you ended your comment with “Ultimately, people just have their narratives and will take any argument to fulfill that narrative” when that’s exactly what you did with every point.   • ”Injury-plagued heat team”? You mean fucking Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo? They’re not even all stars. Nobody expected even a fully healthy heat team to win that series  • Again, the Lakers lost AD and Bron for a significant amount of the season. That helped the Suns to be the 2nd seed and regular season success doesn’t mean they’re destined for the finals. It was shameful for them to tank, but if they could’ve predicted the Lakers would have a compromised Bron and no AD then they obviously wouldn’t have. Suns lucked out on their bad bet.  • The Lakers took a 2-1 lead when they had both AD and Bron (not 100%) on the floor. They lost it when AD couldn’t play anymore. And you suns fans like to pretend that CP not being 100% is comparable to Bron AND AD being injured. It would barely even be comparable if only one of them was.  • Again, you’re comparing CP to Kawhi which is another false equivalency. Clippers would’ve beat the suns if Kawhi was healthy, too.  • Even with the suns not “perfectly healthy”, they lost to the first relatively healthy team they faced. They dodged superstars every round of the playoffs and choked as soon as they got their opportunity to win it all.   I know you guys are proud of being in the finals but you know damn well they beat better teams because they lucked out on injuries. Now that the west is somewhat healthy again (excluding Kawhi) we’ll see what this suns team really is, which is a team definitely not getting out of the west barring some more injury luck."
Got to fight not the pushing shit you see now because guys will be afraid of losing a game check.  Refs will be afraid not to call fouls. Kirk Heinrich and Goran Dragic got fouled the same way.
"My sources are telling me that the Raptors have just upped their offer from Goran Dragic and a 2nd.  As of 3pm today, added in a half-eaten ham sandwich and a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.  76ers management are said to be considering the deal seriously and have not yet declined the trade, we await more news breathlessly and will keep you updated!"
"Goran ""Dr. Strange"" Dragic"
"Yes, he hunts for contact when driving. He does not pump fake and jump into defenders, Goran Dragic did that a lot though"
Goran “Franz Ferdinand” Dragic
"I just don't see him getting the minutes. He averaged 17 ppg in 34 mpg last year. He will be turning 36 years old and competing for minutes with Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo and then a slew of rotation guards.   Last year Butler played 34 mpg, Oladipo was at 28 mpg (recovering from injury so possibly expect an increase in mpg this year), Herro averaged around 31 mpg, and Vincent and Strus were around 13 mpg each in bench roles. Assuming he fills the Goran Dragic role (26 mpg) I'd be shocked if he averaged 15+ ppg. Even if he got more mpg, Miami has a lot of scoring options, I just don't see Lowry needing to score all that much.   Last year only 2 players averaged 15+ ppg at age 35+, they were LeBron James and Chris Paul. Lowry is great but he's obviously a tier or two below LeBron and Paul. Paul played 32 mpg last year and was also an All Star and All NBA 2nd team the past two years. Lowry as good as he is, is still a ways behind Chris Paul."
"Just something to keep in mind; Dragic is pretty injury prone, even at the height of his powers here in Miami.  Even if he’s the better player over GTJ, you can still have Goran come off the bench while also finishing games in crunch time. That’s pretty much what Miami did with Kendrick Nunn and him the past few years."
"&gt; He can still be a very good player, just not for you guys anymore. That much is clear.  Sure but if you work in a front office you're not going to pretend he literally brings nothing to your team. Especially for the Wolves and Cavs who are years away from contending in the playoffs anyway. You have to match salary, you can't just trade your 15th guy and get Simmons in return, at some point we will receive players/picks in return.  &gt;You mean a 24 year old 20ppg scorer making 15m/y?  Good player and probably a starter for us but that's your baseline. IMO Beasley is about as low as you can get. Buddy Heild and Malik Beasley are available players, I just don't see why the season would turn out so great for the kings/Wolves that suddenly they're off the table in a month.   &gt;After a year or two that's exactly what will happen.  Lol Ben Simmons will be gone by the deadline at the very latest, Morey has been a GM for 15+ years he's not dumb enough to sit him a whole season, most people are just hoping we can make it to December when more players are available to be included in a trade. You're talking about Ben becoming a massively negative asset where we can't even trade him and that's ridiculous to me. No, we're not going to sit him for 2 years in Embiid's prime lol we just want to wait a little longer before biting the bullet. And right now it seems that the opportunity cost of doing so is with team chemistry, not what's available on the market.  Yes there will absolutely be more drama with training camp and the start of the season, but that's just noise. Butler got traded, AD got traded, Harden got traded, Kyrie got traded, and all for more or less reasonable value. Throwing a fit doesn't tank what you get in return but shooting 33% from the FT absolutely does. GM's aren't caught up in the news cycle, I'm sure they are able to weigh the positives and negatives and if we REALLY wanted Ben gone we could find a deal with Minnesota like Bodner is talking about. It's really not that crazy to proceed with caution for a player that doesn't have a huge market anyway. Saying it can get lower doesn't make a lick of sense to me, you're imagining a month from now the sixers trading Ben + Maxey + picks for Goran Dragic or something?"
Goran Dragic and 3 firsts. Done deal.
Goran Dragic for sure.
"Goran Dragic, Chris Boucher and a 1st round pick*"
" Half the pgs you listed were done by the time Parker made his award teams. Most of his team's are over guys like Goran Dragic , young Lillard/Harden and post prime dwade. Lillard consistently carries the Blazers to top 5 offenses and is one of the most efficient guards in the league + has some of the most clutch moments in history. He's also a very good passer and will have multiple 25+ ppg / 7+ apg seasons with great efficiency. Literally any top 4 Lillard season , Parker has never even come close to. I agree with your Westbrook point but he was a superstar that got a lot of media attention l."
"Three games with the bench, two games as a starter. 18mpg total, 13.3 mpg in the 3 games off the bench. And he was not good at all.  I trust Nick Nurse and our coaching staff ability to assess Goran Dragic more than either of us, and they decided that Dalano Banton was better. Anyone who watched the four games he played before being out of the rotation knows Dragic played bad, especially on defense which is a major focus for the Raptors. Dragic was bad, got outplayed by the 46th overall pick and was supplanted in the rotation."
"okay to be clear: i am considering “good” to be at least the top half of starting point guards in the playoffs   he didn’t even perform in the top half of the east those years. Kyrie, Wall, Rondo, and IT all had much better years in the playoffs   Lowry was a lot closer to Jeff Teague and Goran Dragic if we are being truthful. and that’s just the East lol"
"&gt;Goran Dragic(team option after this season), Fred Vanvleet and Nando De Colo's contract with maybe 2(or more) very lightly protected future first round picks should be enough to please the Blazers  lol"
If “We have Goran Dragic at home” was a person
Some contender should pounce on Goran Dragic. We're giving him DNPs literally for this reason
"Shai Alexander, Goran Dragic, Damian Lillard"
"It was really Brooklyn since by that point they were either in their final season playing in NJ or their first season in Brooklyn.   Plus the Nets had D.Will before his ankles went south so it’s not like he wanted to join the Nets all by himself and build something.   Unfortunately for Nets fans we had to deal with the Dwight-mare shortly after the Melo-drama before the Nets traded for D.Will after Melo went to the Knicks.    Another unfortunate thing was D.Will not leaving for Dallas as a Free Agent since the Nets had Goran Dragic lined up to take the PG spot when D.Will was on the fence on a 5yrs Max in Brooklyn vs a 4yr in Dallas.   One of the worst parts of missing out on Dwight Howard was Billy King in a panic move sending a 1st to Portland for Gerald Wallace who was already seeing a decline and was then overpaid just to stay. Nets did that with the hopes of re signing D.Will by showing they were all in on winning.    Nets would have most likely drafted Harrison Barnes since they needed SF depth because at the time it was like 4vs5 when they were on Offense from how poor the SF production was.   If the Nets didn’t trade for Wallace and draft Barnes do the Warriors draft the hometown kid Damian Lillard with the next pick? This was before Curry took that next step and was on that cheap contract he signed because of his sketchy ankles.   Warriors could have easily ran Lillard, Curry, and Klay at the 1-3 spot. May have impacted them signing Durant as a FA since I think they needed to let Barnes leave in order to open up enough cap space."
"Injuries (haven’t had their whole team together yet) and the fact that they’re the 3rd least experienced team in the league, 1st if you take away Goran Dragic who doesn’t even play. So yeah, they make a ton of mistakes despite being crazy long and athletic."
"s/o to when I was downvoted for saying Lowry wouldn't be a 17 &amp; 7 player this year.   &gt;he averaged 17 &amp; 7 for a 27 win team. He will be turning 36 years old this season and all of his advanced stats painted him as a pretty average player last season. He's not washed in the sense that he's useless, but folks expecting him to be an all star caliber guy are in for a surprise. I think he probably averages \~11 &amp; 6 this year.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;I just don't see him getting the minutes. He averaged 17 ppg in 34 mpg last year. He will be turning 36 years old and competing for minutes with Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo and then a slew of rotation guards.   Last year Butler played 34 mpg, Oladipo was at 28 mpg (recovering from injury so possibly expect an increase in mpg this year), Herro averaged around 31 mpg, and Vincent and Strus were around 13 mpg each in bench roles. Assuming he fills the Goran Dragic role (26 mpg) I'd be shocked if he averaged 15+ ppg.

Paul played 32 mpg last year and was also an All Star and All NBA 2nd team the past two years. Lowry as good as he is, is still a ways behind Chris Paul.  Folks were saying I was a hater for suggesting he'd average &lt; 15 ppg lmao"
Who do yall think the Mavs should trade for then immediately release Dorian-Finney-Smith?  * Marvin Bagley * Goran Dragic * Chris Boucher * Bradley Beal * Other
We'll give you guys one gently used Goran Dragic in exchange for one Marvin Bagley and/or Richaun Holmes
From the Raptors: Chris Boucher and Goran Dragic
goran dragic lmfao
You may have Goran Dragic and Malachi Flynn
Goran Dragic
well i guess y’all are fucked in the playoffs then. Good luck. Y’all can have Goran Dragic to throw at him too if you want.
"You want Goran Dragic and Chris Boucher? Maybe a future pick to sweeten the deal? The Raptors will make Wood look way better on defense than he is, and we just need someone who can rebound and be tall around the rim."
"Magic got Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams  CP3 for Lou Williams, Beverly and space parts"
Per Tim McMahon that trade was Harden and Fertitta's idea and Morey's disapproval led to his leaving the team. Other trades include...  Clippers got spare parts for CP3  Thunder got spare parts for Harden  Magic got Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams
"By your logic Morey deserves no credit for acquiring CP3 and Harden which is idiotic but whatever, how about  Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams"
"My point exactly. Sir we don't have kawhi and siakam  isn't an all star anymore. Get out of 2019.   We don't have anyone over 6'9 on our team. We have embid, and giannas, in our conference we have to guard...  All our players have come from majority of the g league.   Oh would you look at that majority of our players under 25 4 6 out of 10 are guards in general. The postions van vleet and Goran dragic are taking minutes."
"[Woj] Lebron James has been traded to the Raptors for Goran Dragic, Chris Boucher and Malachi Flynn"
"Heat - Lebron James, Andre Iguodala, Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside, Avery Bradley  Rockets are OP but I wanted to make one for Miami"
"4 lessons we learned about Raptors (and already kind of knew)    1. Chris Boucher is terrible...He looks like a different player this year and the fact that Nurse continues to give him any significant minutes is a head scratcher..   2. They desperately need to trade for a starting center, they are being bullied in the paint and it's costing them defensive rebounds...most of their losses have been within one or two possession and a starting big would probably have made a huge difference tonight.    3. Banton should start over Goran Dragic on nights that Freddie is resting, Dragic actually had a decent game tonight but Bantons energy, defense and ability to create his own shots is more valuable, it's clear that when he's pn the floor everyone seems to play at a higher level...the same can't be said about Dragic..   4. Nurse has to get Barnes more involved in the offence, especially when we are down in a shooting slump, teams are starting to double cover him but it doesn't seem to phase him and good things happen when Bares is driving to rim or shooting jumpers in the post, I suspect Nurse was trying to give the vets an opportunity to pull this one out...that didn't happen..."
Inb4 craptors fans start with: Don’t you know that Masai is a genius?   Just lmao at him choosing goran dragic and precious achihuahua over maxey
Looked like a 50 piece  &gt; The Raptors ended up getting Dragic who hasn't played in their last 9 games and Precious.  [Kyle didn't want to leave yet](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/kyle-lowry-sheds-light-on-why-raptors-didnt-move-him-at-trade-deadline-133531707.html) and trading for Goran/Precious was the only way to do right by him
One of my favorite celebrations lol. From Eddie House to Goran Dragic it’s always great.
"Spot on.  My only update is that Jimmy Butler is most like Kise. Noted for having a complete all-around playstyle with less emphasis on the three, plays true small forward (vs. Lavine and George who also often listed as SF/SG), has outside business and modeling interests, known for a more humorous personality, adapts his playstyle depending on the situation (like in the scrimmage with the third stringers where he only shot the ball once), and can enter the Zone to compete one-on-one with the greatest like in his 40-point triple double win against the Lakers in the Finals when Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic were out.  &amp;#x200B;  My only"
We’re talking about Lowry in his current state. Truth is that he isn’t in his prime anymore and the Heat should seriously consider having him come off the bench in a role similar to Goran Dragic.
Goran dragic over both
goran dragic had his minutes taken by the 46th pick in the 2021 draft

I can tell you as a Suns fan, I love hard-nosed players... but I was even calling Kieff dirty when he was on my own team. He has been trying to start fights ever since he came into the NBA."
"I understand what you mean with the “contention mindset,” I definitely know where you’re coming from. I just disagree with you because 1) I think Coby’s player mold fits *perfectly* on this team, and 2) His value is at an all-time low coming off an injury, and I don’t think whoever we’d be able to trade him for would be a difference-maker, so I’d rather bank on his potential or at least give him a chance to increase his value.  But even so, trading Coby for Dragic even straight up would be insane, Goran is fuckin 35 years old and has been on a steady decline, he’s probably about to retire! Meanwhile Coby just turned 21 and our coaching staff and management love him, Billy has been gushing about him and how important he’s going to be for us once he returns.  I’m not even saying this based on how high I am on Coby either, it’s just that Dragic is pure garbage now. did you watch him at all with Toronto this year before he got benched? It was horrific."
"The Heat that faced bucks were much healthier than when they faced the Lakers. Goran Dragic was arguably their best player and he missed a few games that finals and rushed back, and Bam got injured too."
"even tho hes old, I thought Goran Dragic would have ben a nice cheap fit"
"&gt;Goran Dragic is making $14m  $19 million. I don't know, but I think teams would want to see him play to see if he is washed or the 1st few games were just him starting slow. He didn't look good in preseason and the 1st few games he played."
"""Is Lowry That Big Of An Upgrade Over Goran Dragic?""  - some dumbass scout"
It's even worse if you look at his international career. Goran Dragic didn't see a single minute of playing time at this Olympics with Luka at the helm.
Don't let the Cavs win distract you from the fact that Evan Mobley scored more points for the Raptors than Goran Dragic tonight.
Shai for Goran Dragic and you have a deal
we've got Goran Dragic and Chris Boucher and a ton of late firsts!!!!
"Best team they beat is the Raptors and that was before Raptors stopped playing/starting Goran Dragic who was horrible and was also a back to back game, but that’s not too important."
"Goran dragic, boucher and a first"
"The heat being good now does not disprove they were ""bubble frauds"". They added Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker and Victor Oladipo. While also taking away Goran Dragic, Precious Achiuwa and Kendrick Nunn. They aren't the same team anymore."
Goran Dragic and a 2nd
Precious Achuwa and Goran Dragic?
What exactly would it have cost to get Dragic off the Raptors?  Assuming getting Zoran is a meme (would just cost money to buy out whatever club he's paying for right?) and the actual play is get Goran.
"- Tyler Herro (currently averaging 22.4/6/4.4, leading bench scorer in the NBA)  - Duncan Robinson (extended, enables extensive spacing for two stars who can't shoot even if he's in a slump)  - Precious Achiuwa (used in trade to acquire Kyle Lowry)  - Kendrick Nunn (let go for nothing)  - Salary Filler (would've likely been Goran Dragic &amp; Andre Iguodala, one of which was used in the Lowry trade)  - Two 1st-Round Picks (likely 2022/2024)  - 4 Pick Swaps   this is the king's ransom they asked for Harden."
"the point is that james harden's net impact would not have made up for the loss of all houston wanted for him (that we **DID NOT HAVE ANYWAY**)   now, it's nearly a whole season later -- james harden is struggling, precious achiuwa and goran dragic (**TWO PIECES WHO WOULD'VE LEFT FOR HARDEN**) were exchanged for kyle lowry (who has been phenomenal), and tyler herro is having a breakout year -- not to mention the picks we managed to hold onto that houston wanted  miami won the hypothetical"
we have a lightly used Goran dragic?
"i don't think anyone enjoyed last season. not players, not fans, not coaches. there was  - viceversa jerseys were used something like 40% of the season  - couldn't stay away from .500 which is ironic considering our jerseys were half/half themed  - bounced in the first round after game 1 was incredibly promising and gave everyone hope  - everyone gets COVID. except you, kendrick nunn, you get it twice  - Meyers Leonard immediately injures himself after 3 games and then gets on Twitch and goes Full Dickhead   - Bjelica, Ariza and Harkless come here and, to no one's surprise, are NOT changing the landscape of the team in any way  - tangible Goran Dragic regression  - you trade Olynyk and Bradley away for Oladipo and he is immediately injured after he provides the only hope your season's had  - nearly **all** of our young projects (Achiuwa/Okpala/Gabe) decide it's time to Not Pan Out At All In Any Way (not you, Strus, you're great)  and then, after **72** games of this endless nightmare, everyone on every platform calls your team the Bubble Guppies"
May I interest the mavs in a one lightly used Goran Dragic?
"Damn, throw Goran Dragic under the bus why don't ya"
"Not false, he didn’t want to play there. Ya he apologized so what, real nba fans, real sports Fans, and just people who can see through BS see it.  https://www.tsn.ca/goran-dragic-embracing-opportunity-to-lead-young-toronto-raptors-1.1700271"
Go read a fuckin article jackass … he clearly didn’t want to be there.   https://www.tsn.ca/goran-dragic-embracing-opportunity-to-lead-young-toronto-raptors-1.1700271
Perhaps we can interest them in a lightly used Goran Dragic!
Goran Dragic is available...
They should just trade Tatum and Brown to the Raptors for Goran Dragic so they can finally stop all this drama
Trade him to us for former all star and heat legend Goran Dragic  PLEASE
"Goran Dragic going absolutely bonkers against the Spurts in the last few minutes of the 3Q and pretty much the whole 4Q of Game 3 of the 2010 West Semis was just awesome to watch.  &amp;#x200B;  Recency bias as well, the Valley Oop is hard to top."
Goran Dragic destroying the Spurs on the road in game 3 (aka the goran dragic game) and then finally sweeping the Spurs. And Booker's 7 threes in the first quarter to close out the lakers is a close second.
But enough about Goran Dragic.
I know this doesn't answer your question but Goran Dragic started the first game for the Raptors. Mf ain't even in the rotation anymore
"Read my comment again. Sexton fits well next to Rubio and plays well/better next to Rubio versus SexLand. Sexton plays and looks BETTER with Rubio versus Sexton with Garland. Not Garland and Rubio.  I think Garland's potential is overhyped and overrated. This seems like the same hype people had for Kyrie but Kyrie was a better rookie. I don't think any Garland led team will ever make it deep in the playoffs.  I could say the same about build around Garland. Garland looks worse in our offense than Ricky Rubio who has been traded or let walk by his last four teams. Our other promising young players look much better next to Rubio than Garland but that's ignored.  Unless Garland makes a giant leap this season, I don't foresee him being our PG of the future. He'll be an Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic(with a better start to their career) type who could be a part of a championship team but not be the reason they ever got there."
"We need to reclaim this as a ""You just lost to"" meme. If we are the bubble Guppies then what does that make the teams that dont beat us?   Real talk though our team got to those finals because of many factors coming together. If I were to name a few, Duncans breakout shooting year, Tyler and (to a lesser extent purhaps )Kendricks amazing Rookie campaigns. Bam making a major leap to All-Star level Center, and Jimmy turning on god mode.  Another big part was Goran Dragics elite scoring and playmaking abilities. Last season the limited offseason took its toll on the players both physically and mentally and I think one of the most notable ones was Goran. Of course he wasnt the only one, what woth general decreased effort, herros struggles in his sophmore season, losing Crowder, ect.   But now that we have Lowry, We have regained the missing skills Goran contributed and more as Kyle also is an amazing defender and his outlets seem to really drive our teams pace.   We also got a guy with elite defense at the 4 which was what crowder brought us 2 seasons back and was another key element we were missing last year. Arizais a great defender of course and did his best but didnt have the strength we needed at the 4 position.  And Tyler Herro has effectively reclaimed the high volume scoring 6th mam spot that him amd dragic gave us in the19-20 season.  Dedmon and Morris are solid backups at the big man positions and im very glad we got them and the end of bench huys like Martin, Vincent, Yurtseven, give is great histle when they get thier chances.   Oberall this team has been exciting and its too early to get our hopes up too much but whay weve seen is very impressive and that makes it hard not to get our hopes up."
"&gt; 2 all stars  You're really counting Goran Dragic, who has gotten 3 straight DNP-CD's, as their second All-Star?  Really dude?"
"Goran dragic is a savvy vet u can actually use, maybe malachi flynn as well just because we’re nice."
15.5 mpg. Played in 4 games  https://dailyhive.com/toronto/raptors-coach-nick-nurse-sends-message-by-benching-goran-dragic
Guess who has one Goran Dragic to serve up that's not being used right now??????
"&gt;They traded for him because it was the best young piece they were able to acquire,   Except it wasn't, because Goran Dragic was in the other deal and had already had a coming out playoff performance plus was well regarded already.   Again, Mark Cuban doesn't raise hell the deal goes through, any other suggestion is a joke and you fail to recognize his undue influence on this."
Goran Dragic easily. Holmes is probably 2nd though.
"You clearly dont watch basketball if youre downplaying how good Goran Dragic was that playoffs and how much the Heat missed his scoring in the Finals (our leading scorer in the playoffs until that point). No one is butthurt here except you LOL, go look at your comments in this thread. Youre practically having a nervous breakdown on the internet because your Frankenstein team is falling apart🤣🤣. Dont you wish you guys picked up Lowry instead of Rus hahahaha."
Precious Achiuwa and Goran Dragic
"Ben Simmons for Goran Dragic, salary filler, and picks. You heard it here folks. Simmons will play center in Toronto this year."
Goran Dragic  Kevin Love
absolute domination by Slovenia goddamn. And this is a team w/o Goran Dragic on it either. I really hope they make it to the Gold Medal Game
"I JUST saw that we extended him, WOW!!!! What a day!! (I was so busy tweeting thanks for all Goran Dragic has done for us that I missed it!!) 🔥🔥"
"zoran ""goran"" dragic absolutely on fire"

Miami had attempted to land Lowry at the trade deadline, but couldn't come to terms on a deal with the Raptors. Now, finally, it appears they've landed their point guard"
"Zoran, Goran and Precious. The Dragic brothers"
That's goran dragic money
"[League sources confirm to @miaheatbeat  that the Heat are sending Goran Dragic, Precious Achiuwa, and a future 2nd round pick in the sign and trade deal for Kyle Lowry](https://twitter.com/HawksBeatMHB/status/1422321343421427712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1422321343421427712%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fowpi9p%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dtrue)"
"Middleton was better and even if you think Giannis was, it doesn't change the fact that he was outplayed by 34 year old Goran Dragic and still signed an extension."
Giannis got outplayed by Goran Dragic the year before and signed a massive extension. Were you calling him washed last year?
Can I interest you in a sliiiightly used Goran Dragic?
"I don't think there's anyway Kleber is in a Dragic trade, that would be insane. Goran at that price is not a positive trade, even if it's only one year. Hopefully we'll send Powell back, and maybe Burke."
"I'm gonna get a ""Goran Dragic Trade Exception"" jersey."
The Mavs must have hired /r/mavericks as their front office.   Kidd: I hear Goran is from Slovenia  Cuban and Nico: WE MUST HAVE HIM!   &amp;#x200B;  That being said this offseason is a massive fail if we just end up with Dragic and Hardaway.
Kawhi Leonard plans turn into Kyle Lowry plans that turn into Goran Dragic plans but end up ultimately just resulting in Kelly Oubre and Dennis Schroder for a combined $35 mil APY plans.
Bah gawd that's Masai's music.  Can we interest you in a lightly used Goran Dragic?
[huh? ](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-targets-demar-derozan-goran-dragic-luka-doncic-nba-free-agency)  [are you sure? ](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/263579/Heat-Interested-In-DeMar-DeRozan)
That’s actually exactly what I’ve been saying the last couple days; I’m not even sure Lowry is *that* much better than Dragic to warrant the trade. Dragic has been a little banged up the last couple years so maybe Lowry being just slightly better plus healthier is worth it; that’s how I’m trying to rationalize it. I’ll miss Goran though; he was so much fun to watch when he got cookin’
"The heat need lowry a lot more than the raptors need goran dragic and precious achiwua especially when by not taking that sign and trade, we’ll have 20+ million in cap space to spend on free agents"
&gt;The Dallas Mavericks are a team to watch as a suitor for Goran Dragic after the Kyle Lowry sign-and-trade but only after free agency starts because otherwise it's tampering  FTFY
Dudes are really crying about a Kyle Lowry &amp; Goran Dragic deal   💀💀
"Considering this is our last FA before Lukas max hits and our new FO seems fairly competent, I doubt we will be using our cap space solely on 35, injury prone Goran Dragic."
"Goran Dragic, Precious, and KZ is likely the most Toronto is getting. Unless there is a third team involved. But Miami isn’t giving up Herro and we don’t have 5 first round picks to trade either."
"&gt; Lowry has long been intrigued with joining Heat star Jimmy Butler and the Miami organization, and now Miami has maneuvered to have two key elements of a possible sign-and-trade package -- guard Goran Dragic and forward Precious Achiuwa -- to offer the Raptors once talks can ensue at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, sources said.  &gt; The Heat picked up the option on Dragic's $19.4 million contract for the 2021-2022 season, making him an ideal contractual fit to include in talks to make a deal possible with the Raptors. A market exists for the Raptors to move Dragic, 35, onto a new team, including the Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans, sources said.  &gt; Achiuwa, a well-regarded 2020 first-round pick out of the University of Memphis, showed significant promise in his rookie season and would serve as a sweetener to Toronto to facilitate a sign-and-trade deal, sources said. Miami could add draft assets to a package, too.  Getting Precious, picks, and whatever we get for re-routing Dragic would be a fantastic return for Kyle in a S&amp;T. Keeps our cap space open while also getting some big depth"

"Goran Dragic, 5 first round picks, 3 pick swaps, and Herro, Precious, KZ I guess"
"My best guess is y’all take on Dragic - he becomes a mentor for half a season and then a player thats “available - according to sources” around the trade deadline as a contender would be willing to send some draft pick/player combo for him.   If he actually is gone - I’ll miss Goran like all hell. Been such an amazing player, teammate, and fan favorite for the Heat. Provided us that spark post Big 3 Era. As well, we were all absolutely gutted/crushed when he got hurt in the Finals. If he doesn’t make it there with us again, I truly hope it’s with his next team. Long live the Dragon! 🐉🔥❤️"
Goran Dragic a filler and picks for Buddy Hield  jk but I can see someone dumping a longer contract on Miami for his expiring
"Goran Dragic, 5 first round picks, 3 pick swaps, and Herro, Precious, KZ I guess"
"Report: Lakers also have ‘strong interest’ in Demar DeRozen, Kyle Lowry, Carmelo Anthony, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gay, Trever Ariza, Andre Iguodala, Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Statue of Liberty."
"Only that this game was already the ""next game"" you speak of, seeing as Slovenia sent Spain packing in 2017 European Championship with a 20 point blowout, which was the last time these two teams met (Slovenia also had Goran Dragic that time). So yeah, this was a revenge game already..."
If Luka had some better shooters they might have a chance - but instead he’s got scuffed Goran Dragic and someone have averaged 1ppg on the Nuggs
Zoran Dragic is playing  Goran Dragic is retired from the national team
And then you add Kurt Angle to the mix? Our chances of getting Goran Dragic go up.
Germany are cheats. They're playing Goran Dragic!!!
"Last year in the Finals, the Heat had:  - Bam Adebayo miss two entire games and half of a third  - Goran Dragic miss the entire series after getting injured 14 minutes into Game 1  - Jimmy Butler play the entire series with a sprained ankle he got in Game 1…the same injury that kept LeBron limited/out for extended time in 2021  You going to dismiss the Lakers’ ring too? Of course not. Injuries happen. LeBron’s Lakers ring isn’t cheapened because the Heat were decimated by injuries. Neither is Giannis’."
"if your idea of big free agent is Spencer Dinwiddie when there’s Kawhi Leonard, Tim Hardaway Jr, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Dennis Schroder, Goran Dragic, Lonzo Ball then I don’t know what to tell you lmfaoo Spencer has torn his ACL twice, congrats on another 30 win season"
"For the same reason Marc Gasol was a 2nd round pick. By the way, the following players were picked around the same place or later:  * Giannis Antetokounmpo (15) * Manu Ginoblli (57) * Tony Parker (28) * Steve Nash (15) * Goran Dragic (45)  You might have heard about some of those names?"
"Most scouting reports are full of shit, especially when it comes to Europe. Look at Jokubaitis' report:  ""NBA Comparison: Goran Dragic. Weaknesses: Lacks an elite burst on his first step.""  Next level bullshit, prime Dragic had one of the best first steps in the league."
"THIS IS THE DRAFT PICK THAT THE MIAMI HEAT SENT TO THE PHOENIX SUNS FOR GORAN DRAGIC BACK IN 2015  IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS TO CONVEY  Trade Deadline 2015 - Suns trade Goran Dragic to Miami for 2021 Miami 1st  Draft Day 2018 - Suns trade 2021 Miami 1st and Zhaire Smith to Philly for Mikal Bridges  All Star 2019 - Philly trades 2021 Miami 1st and other assets to Clippers for Tobias Harris  Summer 2019 - Clippers trade 2021 Miami 1st, SGA and a million other picks to Thunder for PG13  2021 - The Miami pick conveys as the 18th Overall Draft Pick and is held by OKC"
Lol Zoran Gragic sounds like Goran Dragic trying to disguise himself with a fake mustache and glasses
"Slovenia won the latest EuroBasket Championship. They shouldn't be considered an outsider. They certainly lack Goran Dragic, but they still have several VERY competent players such as Zoran Gragic, Cancar and of course Mike Tobey. Most of their players have at least some experience playing in the Euroleague or NBA, so it is not like they are complete nobodies + Doncic."
"If goran dragic was a superhero, his evil twin brother would most definitely be named zoran"
Every time they say Dragic I get sad Goran isn’t here
Still remember when teams would concede a roster spot for Zoran Dragic because of Goran. I think Zoran also had to be included in trades for Goran. Goran is a damn good nba player but it was kinda funny that team's used to give him the Giannis treatment by always including his brother in things
"A lot of NBA players, current and former, browse this sub. From the guys I've talked to, Daniel Theis, Goran Dragic, and Cameron Payne I know for a fact are here religiously. Most players actually prefer reddit over other platforms since it lets them remain anonymous. I've heard that Curry is a huge proponent of online privacy."
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
"Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Aleksej Nikolic from the players.    Igor Kokoskov, Rado Trifunovic,Aleksandar Sekulic,basically almost the entire coaching staff was Serb."
"Point guard is #1.  Lowry makes a lot of sense, but he’s gonna be coveted by a lot of teams.    I wouldn’t even rule out a Dennis Schroeder return, but that seems very unlikely since there’s been reports of locker room tension with him.    I’m curious to see if Derrick Rose will re-sign in New York.  I also wanna know how much Spencer Dinwiddie will earn.  Similar for Goran Dragic.    Ish Smith and Bruce Brown are also good.  Bruce Brown is an RFA though.  Ish Smith could be a backup PG target."
Goran Dragic about to lose the ookie cookie
"I think that mindset comes entirely because also around that era the Sixers became the standard bearer for tanking and building around nothing but young inexperienced rookies and high lottery picks.   In reality, Houston treaded water as .500 team, traded for Harden and then became a perennial contender for 10 years.  New Orleans meanwhile struggled no matter who they have drafted or traded for. The lack of winning after Chris Paul has severely hampered the organization from being any kind of destination.   Original trade:   * F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), F Luis Scola (from Houston), G Kevin Martin (from Houston), G Goran Dragic (from Houston)   * Houston receives: PF/C Pau Gasol (from Lakers)   * Lakers receive: PG Chris Paul (from Hornets)   That is a small ball team: a combo guard, a scoring threat, a playmaking 4/5 and a traditional big body but has scoring touch.   Yes they were older but that team would have competed in 2011 practically right away. Not to mention they had solid pieces like Ariza, Belinelli, Greivis Vásquez and Emeka Okafor."
That was a Goran Dragic carry job and he's not playing.
Anyone know why Goran Dragic isnt on the team?
Does anyone know why goran dragic isn't playing?
TIL Goran Dragic has a younger brother named Zoran
Why didn’t goran dragic go
"That last statement misses what I said. I never said Westbrook was the most consistent, but Middleton doesn't offer much when he isnt going (except spacing which is good). When could Westbrook not score on Kanter? Even then, that doesn't dismiss anything I said. Gobert lost them that game because he couldn't take advantage of switches. And based on what he's supposed to impact (defense) he must not have done well, Jokic destroyed him, Rockets and Clippers made him fodder,  but good job cleaning up the 8 seed Grizzlies.  This has got to be pure hate saying ben simmons has any case. What good is a 6'10 PG that isn't aggressive and doesn't space the floor? That's like Russ without all the attributes that make him good on offense. But I gues he's so great because he outplayed Goran Dragic and Jared Dudley. Imagine if Russ put up 1 pt in a playoff game.    &gt;Derozan is shit in the playoffs  It should have ended there. His decent series ended on 7-21 shooting and an absolute brain fart down the stretch.  Westbrook was injured in 2019 and 2020 postseason. 2021 was terrible but he was going against the number one defense with a poor roster."
On the default setting I just traded Goran Dragic (74) and Caris Lavert (79) plus two first round picks for paskal siakam (87). I’m not mad but something seems off lmao
"These are the guys that are getting around 20 million a year. W/o even going into how the good ones aren't easily available, one of these guys + the 4th pick is straight up worse than Simmons. Realistically that 20 million isn't going to get you more than two decent role players, I'd still take Simmons  Nikola Vucevic, C	Chicago Bulls	$24,000,000  Julius Randle, PF	New York Knicks	$21,780,000  Malcolm Brogdon, PG	Indiana Pacers	$21,700,000  Gary Harris, SG	Orlando Magic	$20,482,143  Danilo Gallinari, PF	Atlanta Hawks	$20,475,000  Jerami Grant, SF	Detroit Pistons	$20,002,500  Domantas Sabonis, PF	Indiana Pacers	$19,800,000  Fred VanVleet, SG	Toronto Raptors	$19,675,926  Zach LaVine, SG	Chicago Bulls	$19,500,000  Goran Dragic, PG"
"If Goran Dragic was playing for Slovenia, I would agree with you 100%. But since he’s staying home, I think it’s going to be tough with the roster they have. He would have to have an insane tournament."
Whos that Goran Dragic lookin ass in the french team?
"At first glance, I thought Obst was Goran Dragic wearing a mustache as a disguise to play for Germany."
"&gt;They played a beat up, heat squad who traded away too many players for oladipo who didn't even play in the series. Super easy win  They were way more beat up in the Finals last year. Goran Dragic is their third best player and he didn't even play. Bam was playing through injury. They only traded Kelly Olynk for Oladipo who was on the team last year. Avery Bradley, the other guy the traded, didn't even play in the bubble. They also got Ariza.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Even with this massive stroke of luck it still took a ref destroying Traes ankle for them to win this series  Giannis got injured half a game later and didn't even finish the series. They still won.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Then they managed to avoid the Lakers, Jazz, Clippers and Mavericks in the final  Jazz and Mavericks would not have beaten them. C'mon.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Then they managed to get lucky and avoid the 76ers.  What? 76ers team were not better than the Hawks.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Third best in the east maybe  Who's the 2nd best then?"
Goran Dragic    he lost so many teeth
Goran Dragic
"There’s a difference between losing Goran dragic and losing ad, Jamal Murray, or kawhi fucking Leonard lmao.   No one thinks Miami would’ve somehow beat us last year if dragic was healthy(we were missing our starting point guard too btw).  Almost everyone thinks lakers and clippers would’ve beat Phoenix if healthy. Tons of people think Denver would’ve beaten them too. People still bring up the raptors in 2019 winning Bc kd and klay went down. Some even bring up 2015 still.   It’s what happens when you get lucky, people talk about it. People are gonna talk about the bucks only winning because Brooklyn died once the dust settles too. It doesn’t make the winning team worse, context is just important."
