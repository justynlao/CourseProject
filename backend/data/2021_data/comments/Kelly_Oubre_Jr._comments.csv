"Instead of MYCHAL MULDER, KENT BAZEMORE, DAMION LEE, KELLY OUBRE JR., ERIC PASCHAL, brad wannamaker, the Warriors will have KLAY FRICKIN THOMPSON taking the open shot .... Teams will have to keep an eye on Curry for 30+ minutes every night, running around screens whilst Klay will probably be setting those screens. Klay is more than a shooter and knows the Warriors ball movement and knows to pass it for a better shot. However, what's better than a Klay Thompson top of the 3 point line ball screen for Curry to pass the ball to Klay to shoot a couple feet behind the line? Or could give and go to Curry for the easy 3 or drive to the basket, only to open up an open shooter.  Too many possibilities with just Klay on the court with Curry. There's a reason why they were so dominant, those 2 are probably the best 1 2 offensive punch in NBA history. Klay won't need to sprint every minute he's on the court, I expect him to play smart since he's one of the smartest players on the team."
"Kelly Oubre should be a first, second, third option.  What are the King‚Äôs doing? Fox, Halliburton, and Mitchell can‚Äôt work together. Also, Buddy is a good player.  ‚ÄúIf you look at the analytics‚Äù (this will trigger a number of people in this sub)  Their opinion on Michael Porter Jr.  The order of their ranking of top 10 point guards in the league. Or their order of Luka, Tatum, Booker, Mitchell, Fox, Murray.   If they think Ja is better than Fox"
"We tried. Morey messed it up. Y'all could've had a dream package of Kelly Oubre Jr. And Alen Smailagic for Simmons.  Dream package, I tell you!  Now all we can offer is Mulder and a Top 40-protected 2nd round pick."

"Kelly ""Blackhole"" Oubre Jr."
"Expected 3P% is a rough projection of a player's shooting prowess based on their volume, as well as their efficiency thus far through the season. It's a way to adjust for hot and cold starts. For example, Joe Harris is shooting 48.4% so far, but in reality he's likely closer to a 40.6% three-point shooter. OP can explain it better than I can, here's a great [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/l67c22/oc_what_to_make_of_early_season_hotcold_shooting/) of his on the subject.  &gt;The basic idea behind the padding method is to weigh down (or up) a player‚Äôs three-point percentage by the league average and then gradually ease up on that weight as the player increase their three-point attempts. In other words, the padding method assumes a player is more likely to be a league average shooter than not and gradually relaxes that assumption with each increasing shot attempt.    &gt;   &gt;Kelly Oubre Jr. has shot the ball so poorly and with so much volume that it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs having a worse start to the season than anyone else from behind the three-point line. But even with his cold start, the padding method expects Oubre to shoot a not-great-but-also-not-too-terrible 32.6 percent on 3s the rest of the season. That‚Äôs also probably closer to how defenses will treat Oubre. If he really were a 21.8 percent shooter from 3, opposing teams could win games by literally paying Oubre to shoot ‚Äî although they‚Äôre not far off from doing that. Less than three percent of Oubre‚Äôs three-point attempts this season have been contested (defense that is either ‚ÄúTight‚Äù or ‚ÄúVery tight‚Äù). Only Nikola Vucevic has taken a higher percentage of uncontested looks among the top 50 players in three-point attempts."

Kelly Oubre jr. and Wiggins are long and physical.   They are better on defense than you think

Are we sure Kelly Oubre Jr is actually a really good defender or the offensive player just gets lost in his eyes?
"   ""Technical Foul on Kelly Oubre Jr. for being a horny bitch!""    \- Refs, probably"
I like rooting for Thunder legends so imagine how difficult it is when Markieff Morris plays Kelly Oubre Jr
 flattered Kelly Oubre Jr is looking at me like that through my screen.
Kelly Oubre Jr. Still hoping a turnaround but to say I'm disappointed is an understatement.
Kelly oubre jr is one of the reasons why the warriors are not on this list

Kelly Oubre Jr. super chill dude and hes cute af
You‚Äôre saying you wouldn‚Äôt prefer him to be more selective and continue as arguably the least efficient player in the NBA? Who‚Äôs been less efficient? Maybe RJ Barrett or Kelly Oubre Jr.?

I was watching the game last night and my lady was all the sudden into it. I look over at her phone and she‚Äôs googling ‚ÄúKelly Oubre Jr.‚Äù   We‚Äôre bonding more than ever. Money well spent.
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
Kelly mother fucking Oubre jr
Steph Curry and Kelly Oubre Jr. Are both pretty damn good looking.
Kelly Oubre Jr. OP
Why would we be a good fit with Kelly Oubre Jr if we already have OG and Oubre doesn't want to come off the bench???

"&gt;The actual question is ""Would the Suns be better with Chris Paul Abdel Nader, and roster space for two of Galloway/Moore/Kaminsky... or Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr, Ty Jerome, and Jalen Lecque?"" And the answer is Paul, Nader, and the other two.  Fair enough, but I think given the respective records, it's fairly close.  &gt; You previously mentioned we went 14-7 in our last 21. But we were 6-7 before the bubble, and as much as us Suns love the 8-0 run we did have wins against some resting teams.  14-7 corresponds roughly with Ayton's availability.  Obviously he's a huge deal.  Yes, the bubble was unique, but just in the last month, as I noted elsewhere, the Suns have wins over: the Davis-less Lakers, the McCollum-less Blazers, the Curry-less Warriors, the Davis-and-James-less Lakers, and the Wolves twice.  They also lost to the Wolves and the tanking Magic.  So I think it's fair to equate this season and last, and even to the bubble."
"The Bubble Suns had $18M of that $24M invested in Oubre, Ty Jerome and Jalen Lecque, who were also part of the trade. Granted we took back Nader, that adds $2M more, so realistically, we would have had $8M extra to spend. Considering we have $-18M in cap space, we would have still been $-10M over and unable to sign anyone outside of minimum contracts anyway.  The actual question is ""Would the Suns be better with Chris Paul Abdel Nader, and roster space for two of Galloway/Moore/Kaminsky... or Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr, Ty Jerome, and Jalen Lecque?"" And the answer is Paul, Nader, and the other two.   You previously mentioned we went 14-7 in our last 21. But we were 6-7 before the bubble, and as much as us Suns love the 8-0 run we did have wins against some resting teams.   This team is demonstrably better with Chris Paul and a full bench."

The jump from Caleb Martin to Kelly Oubre Jr is gonna be insane

"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."

Its a shame that his team was so overwhelmingly talented on offense, tho... I mean Klay was... wait... Klay didn't play a single minute all year? Really? What about Durant? Oh, he left a while ago. Iggy too? Well they still had absolute offensive juggernauts such as Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre Jr., Paschall...  Curry completely estroyed plebs like you this year, who were harping for years about how he was only able to score because of Klay and a great overall roster...  His roster this past year was pure trash, arguably as bad as MJ pre Pippen and Gran, and  he posted 44 pts (per 100) on +9 rTS%... MJ probably peaked as a regular season scorer with 43.5 pts (per 100) on 6.5-7 rTS%... Still insane numbers, but saying Curry doesn't deserve to be in this tier as a scorer is false."

He just came off of a season where he averaged 32 points per game, the most in his career, and you make it sound like he can't even lead a team anymore. He's still as good as he was before, and his game's gonna age very well. The issue was that his entire team was hobbled and he had to play with a pretty shabby cast outside of Kelly Oubre Jr., Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green. The first two players are just average to slightly above average starters.   I dunno, reading your comments just feels like those weird LeBron haters that just overexaggerate his flaws and treat them like they're more prominent than the pros."
"The Charlotte Hornets reportedly¬†reached an agreement on a multiyear deal with forward Kelly Oubre Jr., per¬†[Chris Haynes](https://sports.yahoo.com/sources-kelly-oubre-jr-hornets-finalizing-multiyear-deal-040501765.html)¬†of Yahoo Sports.  ""The final numbers are still being ironed out, but his annual salary is expected to exceed $12 million,"" Haynes wrote.  Oubre"
The upgrade from Caleb Martin to Kelly Oubre Jr would be massive!
"Let‚Äôs go team 31 of the NBA ‚ÄúYoung Socialites‚Äù starring Ben Simmons, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Dennis Schroeder"
&gt;Kelly Oubre the classic subtraction by addition every where he's gone really is the move to sell Dame on.  Have you met Derrick Jones Jr
"Norman Powell gets $90mil, that's a mistake I rather have the blazers doing than the Lakers.  Also, you fail to mention he had 0 points against the suns on the most important game of the season. Drummond can also get 15-20 a night yet be completely useless.   I'm not saying he is unlikable garbage, I'm just rating him on the terms he set for himself, want $100 mil? Play $100.  To give more than $30 mil to him is to shoot your franchise in the foot.   Good role player who wants to be 2nd or 3rd option but doesn't have what it takes, big mouth and small actions. Funny thing I could be talking about Kelly Oubre Jr without having to change anything."

Jalen Green gonna be all star Kelly Oubre Jr. Prove me wrong.
the Boston Celtics have traded my wife of 15 years for kelly oubre jr and a top 15 protected 1st round pick
"Sure, but all it really takes is one or two guys on the floor who don't get it to mess the whole thing up.  So the Warriors example would be James Wiseman and Kelly Oubre Jr."
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
Kelly oubre Jr.
"&gt;Some on the Golden State Warriors are watching closely the next move of Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Should he become available, he‚Äôs at the top of the offseason wishlist.  &gt;The Warriors‚Äô trio of stars ‚Äî Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson ‚Äî have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.  &gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards‚Äô guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.  &gt;Of course, ‚Äúavailable‚Äù is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.  &gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men‚Äôs basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.  &gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don‚Äôt suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.  &gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.  &gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He‚Äôs a preferred target over the Raptors‚Äô Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator ‚Äî two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.  &gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn‚Äôt fit the Warriors‚Äô typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.  &gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.  &gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week‚Äôs draft. The Warriors‚Äô No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors‚Äô veterans ‚Äî Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31‚Äî is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.  &gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn‚Äôt be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors ‚Äî appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  &gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant‚Äôs ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson‚Äôs return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.  &gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.  &gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors‚Äô options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season‚Äôs end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn‚Äôt expected to return to the Warriors."
Apparently Spurs *players* are *anxious* to get Kelly Oubre Jr in free agency.
Kelly Oubre Jr 2023 NBA Finals MVP confirmed
"I have a non lazy take on the whole thing. Was Wiseman bad? Yes, was he as bad as everyone is making him out to be? No. Look at the Dubs this year vs last year. Even Wiggins was not having a great year. He was consistent but not great. The paint was clogged and they weren‚Äôt playing Warriors team basketball. The main reason? Kelly Oubre Jr. Now I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a bad player, he just wasn‚Äôt a Warriors style player.   Now that he‚Äôs gone look at how Wiggins has excelled. Look at how well Looney is doing. With a simplified role and Wise will have to earn his minutes, I see a big jump for him. As long as he can rebound and play passable defense which the new rules should help. He will add a dimension that the Warriors have yet to unlock."
"That's why Kelly Oubre Jr, Brad Wanamaker, Kent Bazemore, Mychel Mulder and Eric Paschall are all still with the team and doing well right?"

"Wolves still getting that 14 total of steals and blocks, with Prince and Vando contributing 2 steals each at least, while keeping team turn-overs close to around 10.  But what the hell can our defense do against a team shooting 23/40 from 3 ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ That's nearly 60%. We need Clamps Okogie and Pat Bev to handle the shooters above the 3-point line.  Clamps is gonna need time to adjust back to game-speed, and Pat Bev will be off for a week only hopefully, and when they're back to their rythms, the Wolves defense might be able to stop Kelly Oubre Jr. next time."
The Suns also got notably better when they added Kelly Oubre Jr.

Andrea Bargnani was a productiveish player for like 7 years and still considered a bust not all bust are the same there's levels and when you haven't made a single asg, all NBA team and only been in one playoff series and only really a productive starter and you were considered to be a lot more and you turn into Rudy Gay (who was drafted 8th in his draft) idk man"

"Curry is at 18,999 currently and will finish near 20k by the end of the year. He averages about 1,700 points per year. You times that by 7. It would take curry at 40 years old 19 years with no injuries in the future to  pass kobe in scoring.... it's not longevity just kobe is a better scorer.   Curry getting subbed out is because his teams are amazing and torch teams collectively. You even said it.. klay dropping 60 in 3 quarters. Curry didn't have that luxury last year... Kobe was scoring 35ppg with Kwame brown not Andrew Wiggins , kelly oubre Jr, draymond green. Kwame brown.  Plus we all know curry is the greatest shooter, but scorer no."

He‚Äôll make a ton of improvements by playing with Andre Iguoudala and Otto Porter Jr. instead of Brad Wannamaker and Kelly Oubre.   Our team is begging for Wiseman‚Äôs skill set.

kelly oubre jr shooting better from three than the line.  it feels like he (and wiggins) produced this kind of statline fairly often last year. orz
Current: Kelly Oubre Jr   All time: Derrick Rose
Kelly Oubre Jr.?
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
"You know how everybody over-rates guys on their favorite team?   Yeah. That's what you're doing.   Porzingis is a negative asset at this point, and the Mavs would trade him for Capela in a heartbeat. And I'm absolutely here for the Tim Hardaway Jr resurgence, I love guys who rebuild their game later in their career, but I think you're vastly over-rating how he's seen around the league.   The best version of KP is much better than Capela, but the version we've seen post-most-recent-injury plays on the perimeter, doesn't play much defense, and stands around a lot. The argument that he's better than Capela is basically that pre-injury KP is hiding somewhere, ready to come up - but at a certain point that starts to become really optimistic.   You have like $20m in cap space this coming year, right? Or does basketball reference have a non-guaranteed contract listed as guaranteed? That's a nice chunk of change, but it's not ""A ton"" of cap space. It'll probably get you a player of approximately the quality of Kelly Oubre. (Who, by the way, would be a great fit!)"
"Honestly I could see the Warriors be down for a sign and trade with Kelly Oubre Jr.. and some filler. KP on the Warriors might be just was the doctor ordered.  If Javale can thrive, maybe KP could."
* Buddy Hield * Kelly Oubre Jr * LaMelo Ball
Luka should hire Kelly Oubre Jr to distract him at the line
Kelly Oubre Jr. and Andrew Wiggins
I wonder if they consider putting some package together around:  * Sign and trade Kelly Oubre Jr * James Wiseman  * The 2021 Minnesota pick if it goes to them  * Their 2021 pick  * Eric Paschall
"I'm not concerned. I really like what we see.   I honestly think we should look into what value James Wiseman has on the trademarket. Despite a few flashes of greatness, I just don't think he's going to pan out to be that good, nor do I think he will be an impact player during Steph Curry's window. We could bring in a few veteran players on a trade and sign a free agent center or two. They don't have to be star athletes, they just need to be fundamentally solid like Bogut and Za. No need to find a freak athlete, just somebody who can set a pick and roll, and rebound. That's all we need.  I'm hoping Klay comes back strong, and I'm not stacking the odds against him because we all know how bad he wants it. Case point, look at Durant. If he can come back at that level, we will be just fine.  As for the roster, it's shaping up well. I like a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins. Throw in a veteran center, or Kevon Looney and you have something cooking. JTA should take off some of the pressure from Klay Thompson. He will make a great sixth man. Jordan Poole is really coming along and will make an excellent backup point guard to Curry. I'm looking forward to seeing a healthy Eric Paschal. And to be honest bringing back Kelly Oubre Jr for the right price it's probably a good move considering he had a terrible first two months of the season and still finished with 15 points average. He adds some necessary size and length off the bench at the forward position.   Don't trade Wiggins, he's only 26 and just really coming into his own. I was in awe at how well he was playing defense in the first half of that Lakers game. Hopefully he can build upon that. However, I feel like we can recreate the 15 and 16 team with Wiggins instead of Harrison Barnes. Wiggins definitely has the higher upside.   But, much of that is riding on whether or not Klay Thompson comes back healthy. Personally, I would never count him out. He has the heart of a champion and is a straight killer. As long as he is still a spot up shooter, we should have a great second option on the perimeter and somebody dangerous that you had better not leave open in order to double team Steph Curry.  We really need to tailor the game plan around Steph Curry getting double teamed, so we can find the open guy and get the best shot. Obviously this will require ball movement and ball security! Emphasize ball security! That has been our Achilles heel.   I'm crossing my fingers that we can add a 4th or 5th pick from Minnesota this year because we can add some talent with an extremely high upside, plus a building block for the future.  The entire league better be on lookout next year because the Warriors are coming full steam ahead."
"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors‚Äô execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip‚Ä¶](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6‚Äô9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV‚Äôs threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.  Ja Morant came out looking to prove something after Friday‚Äôs game. Started with making his 3 point shots and was [throwing JTA into a blender 1v1.](https://i.imgur.com/FsoBF5O.mp4) Halfway through the 1st and he was outscoring the Warriors 10-9. Chase Centre sounded like it was the peak of the pandemic.  [The Warriors were looking like they have never played together](https://i.imgur.com/rltn89b.mp4) - Bazemore should know that‚Äôs always a switch.  An important change takes place as Poole checks in - The chance to have someone else running pick and roll and add some extra spacing for Curry to run around in the week side [starts to pay some due](https://i.imgur.com/kRuL3D0.mp4). This was immediately followed by [the ‚ÄúCurry experience‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph‚Äôs 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don‚Äôt have Draymond‚Äôs help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV‚Äôs gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can‚Äôt switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).  Wiggins goes at Grayson Allen and, blowing by him, draws the 3rd fouls on Jonas at the rim. The big goes to the bench again with his team ahead by 6. They were looking to have Andrew post up Allen but [good job fronting the bigger player](https://i.imgur.com/9L9SFyg.mp4).  With the starters back in, [the turnovers out of Draymond and Steph passes continues](https://i.imgur.com/dYq2aeB.mp4). With the constant sloppiness, [the controlled play of Morant](https://i.imgur.com/mPLoLyv.mp4) and the better outside shooting (MEM shooting 9-17 and Curry missed a couple of wide open ones), went to rest leading by 13.   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **2ND HALF**  Early in the 3rd we saw the home team busting out a zone defense and [the different look worked to create some confusion and staleness](https://i.imgur.com/yYf4q4p.mp4).   Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven‚Äôt mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray‚Äôs drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant‚Äôs shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an ‚Äúso wide open its practice‚Äù 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond‚Äôs drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn‚Äôt make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn‚Äôt capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."
That‚Äôs debatable. They were literally the worst team in the league last year and they added Steph Curry and Kelly Oubre Jr. Really doubt Oubre was the difference maker.
Kelly Oubre Jr. Shouldn't really be in the LVP conversation . As you said in the Hood one he was saved his blushes due to injury. But Oubre was coming off a meniscus tear to start the season which is likely why he was so out of rhythm. During his only healthy stretch of the season he averaged 19 on like 46/37/75. With good defence which is pretty valuable.
"&gt;Why has he not played in so long?  Hip Injury  &gt;Why is getting DNP‚Äôs?  Hip Injury  &gt;Was he not promising?""  Still is. Hip injury.   &amp;#x200B;  [Article from yesterday:](https://sports.yahoo.com/warriors-lakers-4-key-questions-180143370.html) ""While the Lakers have been dealing with injuries to LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Warriors have been rolling with an eight-man rotation due to Kelly Oubre Jr., Damion Lee and **Eric Paschall** being sidelined..."""
Uh - you do realize [the Warriors likely can‚Äôt afford to resign Oubre ](https://bluemanhoop.com/2021/05/06/golden-state-warriors-sign-kelly-oubre-jr/) anyway right?

I think Kelly Oubre Jr got kicked in the head by a mule when he was growing up.
"You are overvaluing Wiggins. He‚Äôs an average defender and an average scorer (at best).   You could find guys like Dejountae Murray, Kelly Oubre (yes I know), Lonzo Ball, Tim Hardaway Jr, even Harrison Barnes.  I tried to choose guys not on rookie contracts cuz that‚Äôs not fair.  What about 3 cheaper players from Minnesota? I‚Äôm sure that would‚Äôve been more value. Honestly Wiggins isn‚Äôt better than your average player. Grabbing three average players in a trade for D Lo would have added depth."
Kelly Oubre jr?
"Michael Jordan, he was gambling like crazy, he was great on ball, but he definitely had a lot of bad moments off the ball  Currently :  \- Mason Plumlee : Malone always used him as a defensive sub, despite the fact that he's not even a better defender than Jokic, he plays hard, but he makes a lot of mistakes, fouls a ton, he's average at the absolute best  \- Kelly Oubre and Gary Trent Jr : those 2 together because they are the same, they play ultra hard, they put on a show, tap on the floor, get on a ultra low stance....but I've actually rarely seen them stay in front of anyone decent, and both aren't strong enough for the real big wings  \- Domantas Sabonis and Brandon Ingram most people think they are average/slightly below average, in reality they are terrible  \- PatBev : he's still useful because he's strong for his size and can switch but he fouls a toooon and a lost a lot of lateral quickness  \- Khris Middleton : he's still a decent option on big wings because of his size but since his injury a few years ago he' snot been the same athlete at all, he can't stay in front, he execute the scheme well, and can send his guy to Lopez/Giannis at the rim, but he can't stay in front of guys  \- Lou Dort : he might be THE best iso defender in the league, but he's not that good at getting trough screens, guarding off ball movement, he's a great defender, but he's gotten a bit overrated  \- Robert Covington : great help defender, a really mediocre on ball guy  \- Donovan Mitchell : the new Russ, still has a defensive reputation because he was good in college, he's at best average, probably worse than that.  \- And to finish the one that will get me downvoted, he's an awesome defender, but Ben Simmons isn't the DPOY"

"Their 12 would be:   Corey Kispert, Cole Anthony, Sekou Doumbouya, Troy Brown Jr, Justin Jackson, Juancho Hernangomez, Kelly Oubre Jr, Adreian Payne, Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Mo Harkless, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Sanders.   So something like Anthony, Oubre Jr, Kawhi, Giannis, Hernangomez - Brown Jr, Kispert, Harkless, Jackson, Sanders - Payne, Doumbouya."
"That's all true. On the other hand, Wiggins had basically never played with Curry and now has the benefit of a year's experience plus training camp, and they've exchanged Kelly Oubre for Otto Porter Jr. who, if at all healthy, will at least be a much better fit; Eric Paschall for Bjelica, who likewise; and 2020 Jordan Poole for 2021 Jordan Poole, a significant upgrade. We'll see, but Curry's supporting cast is much improved."
"if that's the logic, what about protections where it's like ""if the FRP doesn't convey, you get some SRP(s) instead""?  that happened when GSW kept their top 20-protected 2021 pick and a couple other 2021 SRPs were then conveyed to OKC.  (this was for getting Kelly Oubre Jr. from OKC. https://www.spotrac.com/nba/charlotte-hornets/kelly-oubre-jr-17843/)  there are a few other transactions I've seen where it's like ""FRP lottery-protected for 7 years, if it doesn't convey by then you get the SRP instead""."
Kelly Oubre Jr when he was on the Suns. Still today he's worshiped on /r/suns because they falsely credit him with a culture change that was actually enacted by Monty Williams.
Kelly Oubre Jr. (KPJ)  Zach Lavine (0G)  PJ Tucker (Tate)  i have no idea (Theis)  John Henson (Cwood)
Some other \#15 picks in recent years:  2014 Adreian Payne  2015 Kelly Oubre Jr.  2016 Juan Hernang√≥mez  2017 Justin Jackson  2018 Troy Brown Jr.  2019 Sekou Doumbouya  2020 Cole Anthony  I knew very little about any of these guys before they were drafted. The one guy who I had seen some of was Justin Jackson because of the ncaa championship.

"Haha I go for Charlotte, but couldn't Kemba be in the trade  Kemba, Bazley, Poku #6, #16, Clips 2022 first, Denver 2023 first, OKC 2024 first  For   Lillard  Then they could sign a center (or trade for one) and sign Kelly Oubre Jr and there have a pretty decent starting 5  Center TBC Kelly Oubre Jr Lu Dort Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Damian Lillard"
I‚Äôd pay to have intimate sex with Kelly Oubre Jr as a straight male.
Kelly Oubre Jr.
"Kelly Oubre Jr. I mean, have you ever just looked into those eyes?"
"He reps a few players. According to realgm he reps Tobias, Tobias' brother, Kelly Oubre Jr, and Tobias' other brother."
"The Heat, in less than a year, going from the finals and clearing cap space for Giannis to first round sweep and clearing cap space for Kelly Oubre Jr. would be incredibly cathartic"
PG: Raul Neto  SG: Paul George  SF: Kelly Oubre Jr  PF: Maxi Kleber  C: Sergi Ibaka
"Klay Thompson, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Wiseman all out with injuries."
"Still apples and oranges. Both Harden and Kyrie were there for a big part of the regular season. And nets got help by Griffin too. Do you seriously compare that roster to Kelly Oubre Jr,DG, Wiggins etc? Almost terminating the bucks and actually doing it is worlds apart just like almost losing to OKC but actually winning. And in that series in particular, they didn‚Äôt lose Kyrie before game 4. KD is the undisputed best player on the planet but let‚Äôs not pretend he was playing on his own vs the bucks or that Steph had a support cost even remotely comparable to KD."
Throwback to when Paul George punked Kelly Oubre Jr.
