Breaks Terrence Ross record right?
Terrence Ross is in shambles
"that draft was BAD, there's legit no way Draymond makes it to 7.  He's at worst the 5th pick in retrospect and probably goes 4th.  AD, Lillard, Beal, Draymond &amp; Khris Middleton are the top 5 players.  After that it's Harrison Barnes, Jae Crowder, Drummond, Fournier, Terrence Ross &amp; Austin Rivers.  Oddly enough it seems likely that the Warriors would end up with Harrison Barnes all over again."
Terrence Ross
"And we will have the parity argument then here too  ""NFL much more competitive""   Yeah when u have 17 games and 1 game series, imagine Terrence Ross drops 50 on your ass and you lose that game"
Terrence Ross. That guy never misses when he plays us.
"Magic fans, what would you want for Terrence Ross?"
Pleasant: Terrence Ross  Unpleasant: Aaron Gordon
Seeing Terrence Ross at the exact other end of that is fitting.

"Terrence Ross, maybe Aaron Gordon, Larry Nance, Harrison Barnes...  Hard to know who will be available the moment as most teams are playing hard to win."
The white terrence ross
"Celtics fans are collectively losing their shit over the prospect of trading for Harrison Barnes.    I personally am pretty intrigued by Terrence Ross, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes, Garrett Temple, and Otto Porter Jr."
realistically? trade Kyrie for Mo Bamba and Terrence Ross  downvote me. my body is ready
ALSO TERRENCE ROSS
Terrence Ross
Nobody has ever confused Terrence Ross with someone who doesnt know his role or lacks confidence. Actually having a strong season shooting the ball if you ignore the 22.9% from 16-22 ft part.
My pick doesn’t look as good now but I’m sticking with my Terrence Ross prediction.  Clarksons shooting will cool off
"Big time disagree with Oregon  Terrell Brandon, Danny Ainge, Mike Dunleavy, Damon Stoudamire were all better than AC green. That’s as an OSU homer too. Fuck it, even sabonis or Terrence Ross from today would be better."
"Reminds me of the Raptors Kings game in like 2017 where Terrence Ross hit a 3 to send it to OT got it off before the buzzer. They then found out that the clock didn’t start in time, so they reviewed the play and checked if the shot would’ve counted if the clock was right. The shot didn’t count, so they waived it off and the raptors lost"
"Not great, but that’s to be expected with all the injuries.   Bright spots: Nikola Vucevic and Terrence Ross"
This is the most Terrence Ross thing ever.
"Terrence Ross and Julius Randle had a nice throw-off, unfortunately for Randle Ross had Cole Anthony on his side"
Terrence Ross is a killer
Terrence Ross is pissed as fuck lol
Terrence Ross buzzer beater in Sacramento.
terrence ross
I wouldn’t call it selfish cause it’s his job but Terrence Ross
couldn't defend Vucevic and some stupid terrence ross shots. They were fine defensively
A KD Vs Terrence Ross shootout. Like just what I expected.
terrence ross and vuc carrying the fuck out of this magic team
Terrence Ross is the goat?
Terrence Ross don’t give a fuck about your super team
Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross can be a lowkey 4th option for contender. Magic is wasting him!
Terrence Ross what
That 14/20 hasn't necessarily come from bad interior defense. Lots of midrange shots from bad communication plus Terrence Ross popped off for a bit
Oladipo and Sabonis for Terrence Ross and a pick. Good lord are some teams mismanaged.

I already know Terrence Ross is going to throw flames tonight
"the big names I've seen on the Celtics sub are Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Terrence Ross, PJ Tucker, and most recently Oladipo (even tho dipo is more of a ball handler than a wing)"
Seems like Will Barton always plays well against us. Will Barton and Terrence Ross would be in the starting lineup of players that go off against GS
Terrence Ross&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kawhi Leonard

Terrence Ross! Dude loves going beast mode when we play magic and torches us every time
"Good question. My picks might be understandably controversial. Shake Milton, OG Anunoby, and Terrence Ross."
I like Terrence Ross as a 6MOY too
"Terrence Ross. Helps with the wing depth too. And he’s on a fantastic contract as well, decreasing salary for the next few years"
"Granted some of these guys are still respectable NBA players, but I thought they all had All-Star/All-Defense upside at the very least:  Jabari Parker  Nik Stauskas  Nerlens Noel  Kris Dunn  Frank Ntilikina  Terrence Ross  Evan Turner  Perry Jones III"
Remember when Terrence Ross buzzer beater was stolen by the refs?
Terrence Ross sends his regards
Terrence Ross had a 50 point game. Norman Powell has had weeks averaging points in the high 20s but he won't be winning a scoring title any time soon. People never learn.
I'm more terrified of Terrence Ross catching fire from 3 than any other Magic player
Terrence Ross is a decent sixth man.
"terrence ross. leads the league in bench ppg, literally carries us all the time"
"Terrence Ross on Magic, Murray on Nuggets, Klay, Wiggins (I still believe in him - especially if vs OKC), DLo, PG13, Tatum or Brown (if one is injured and they get a bunch of shots), Jimmy Butler (man scored 40+ in the finals), Westbrook, Embiid, Seth Curry, Kevin Love (hot take but if healthy sure), fucking Austin Rivers, John Wall ( I’m still a believer), Donavan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams"

Terrence Ross been goated on 2k since he entered the league
"These are not my predictions but simply my picks right now, two weeks into the season.  MVP: James Harden (37! ppg)  DPOY: idk...Joel Embiid maybe  ROTY: Tyrese Haliburton...although I think LaMelo pulls ahead by the end of the season  6MOY: Terrence Ross  MIP: Christian Wood. Jaylen might be slightly better this year but Wood made a bigger jump from last year.  COTY: Monty Williams"
If the season ended today itd be Terrence Ross.   But if Bogdan in Atlanta continues to come off the bench it'll probably be him
Terrence Ross
i'm all aboard the terrence ross hype train.  he plays starter minutes since the starting sg is dwayne bacon.
"It's so much more fun doing that with random players. Slashers are buffed so hard in the new 2k, my brother and I were playing Magic vs Thunder and we just went back and forth each dropping 60+ with Hamidou Diallo and Terrence Ross"
"MVP: James Harden (assuming he stays and Rockets nab top seed)  DPOY: Deandre Ayton  MIP: Christian Wood OR Markelle Fultz   6MOY: Terrence Ross   ROY: Anthony Edwards  COTY: Rivers, maybe Monty tho"
6MOY is terrence ross. 22 ppg off bench
"Yeah but less points than Terrence Ross, less rebounds than Mason Plumlee, and less assists than Demar Derozan"
"Human Torch is Terrence Ross, at least in Orlando"
"You think arguably the greatest player of all time wouldn't practice more on his 3-pt shot in the most 3-happy era in the game's history?   During the shortened 3-pt line era he averaged 40.4% on 3.3 3PA per game. You seriously think a foot of distance difference would be too much for Michael Jordan to overcome?   I'm not even claiming he'd be a ""great"" shooter either. I'm saying 37.5% on 8 attempts. Tim Hardaway Jr. is shooting 37.8% on 7.4 3PA per game. Devonte Graham shot 37.3% on 9.3 3PA last year. Terrence Ross shot 38.3% on 7.0 3PA two years ago. D-Lo has averaged 36.8% on 8.4 3PA over the past three seasons.  You're telling me these guys are better shooters than Jordan? That he can't do what they're doing at the very least, if not better?  It makes less sense to assume he wouldn't practice more, he wouldn't focus more on it, and that he wouldn't be a slightly above average 3-pt shooter if he played in this era.   The 3-pt average since he's retired has been right around 35-36%. Jordan isn't capable of that?"
"To improve on the team that made the ECF last season we really just need Kemba healthy. The Jays have stepped up in a big way. Tatum, Brown and (healthy) Kemba is looking like a really strong top 3.   To take the next step, we're one starting level wing short and it means we're asking for a lot from everyone. We're relying on our top-end talent having huge nights every night and we play a lot of bad lineups that end up costing us games.    All of our main bench players are individually good when they're playing with the starters. The issue is when we play our bench players with other bench players.   Grant Williams is a great example, he looks good playing next to Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum. He looks pretty bad when he's playing next to 2-3 other Grant Williams.    We could chase a secondary star, but even just 1 decent wing would take a lot of pressure off our guys.   Eg:  * Robert Covington * Otto Porter Jr * Jae Crowder * Harrison Barnes * Terrence Ross * etc etc  Our bench players are good fill-ins but 1 more starting wing would mean we don't have to play so many lineups that have a bench majority."
Also Terrence Ross &amp; late career Andre Miller
"Okay fine--  &gt;That would make sense if we assume Dame is an average player  Usually average players don't take a ton of shots in the last 10 seconds of close games. You're comparing Dame to other primary options in this scenario. Here is the list of players who have taken at least 3 shots in the last 10 seconds of a 1 point or tied game:  LaVine, Murray, LeBron, Booker, Mitchell, Tatum, Doncic, CP3, Dame, Brogdon, Siakam, Steph, Beal, Hield, Sexton, Damion Lee, Fox, Sabonis, VanVleet, Grant, KD, Jokic, DeRozan, Giannis, Quickley, Embiid, Kuzma, Lowry, Dort, Harrell, SGA, Terrence Ross, Rozier, and Myles Turner.   For the most part besides Quickley, Kuzma, Dort, and Damion Lee those are all #1 or #2 guys on their teams and not average players at all. So really comparing Dame to league average FGA on these one possession close game shots isn't comparing Dame to average players at all, it's essentially comparing him to the average #1 or #2 option for any given team."
"Big list, but...  &amp;#x200B;  **Victor Oladipo**  HOU  **PJ Tucker**  HOU  **Eric Gordon**  CHA  **Richaun Holmes**  SAS  **Nemanja Bjelica**  SAC  **George Hill**  LAC, if they have enough cap space  **Al Horford**  Stays or is released.  Bad contract  **JJ Redick**  Whoever needs shooting.  MKE or LAL probibly, maybe back to Philly  **Nikola Vucevic**  Hornets?  Maybe Celtics  **Evan Fournier**  Stays in ORL  **Terrence Ross**  Warriors or Hornets  **John Collins**  Depends.  Likely ether traded to WSH for Beal or SAS for DeRozan, maybe HOU for Olidipo  **Larry Nance**  CLE  **Kyle Lowry**  Clippers is a nice fit, but no cap space.  If he is traded, I could see NYK or DAL  **Lamarcus Aldridge**  Terrible contract.  That being said, NYK or buyout"
"I think Vassell will be a good NBA player and one of the most likely to reach his ceiling but I don't think his is as high as Luka or Lonnie.   Luka could be a game changer but he has a long way to go, recent success aside. Lonnie has off the charts athleticism and a smooth stroke but I worry about him not quite getting there (somewhere between a non-crazy JR Smith and Terrence Ross -- guys you glance at and think this guys is amazing, why isn't he a star?)  I would be happy to be wrong and see Devin become and allstar/all NBA performer but."
Terrence Ross was a god this game other than the last shot.
Terrence Ross
"Especially considering that just a year later the Thunder flipped those two for Paul George, while the Magic flipped Ibaka for Terrence Ross and a late first round pick. What makes it even worse is that Ibaka actually turned out to be a key contributor to the Raptors championship."
"give me 2012-13 jr smith  edit: sorry didn't see it had to be active player, i think terrence ross is a possible candidate i believe he won the dunk contest one year"
brogdon played every game. brogdon &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terrence ross.
"I’d honestly be down to explore Horford as an option   Barnes seems to be the main target within the Cs subreddit but some other names tossed around    Terrence Ross, Devonte Graham, Alec Burkes, George Hill, Patty Mills, Danuel House, Wayne Ellington, Thad Young, PJ Tucker   pretty slim pickings tbh"
Shit I forgot that too lol. Was that the one Terrence Ross won?
"It's even worse when you look at the big picture that that trade lead to.  Magic trade Tobias Harris for Ilyasova and Brandon Jennings.   They then trade Ilyasova, Oladipo, and Sabonis for Serge Ibaka.   They used the cap space from trading away Tobias Harris to sign Bismack Biyombo.  Ibaka is then traded for Terrence Ross and a 1st that AFAIK never played a game for the Magic.    So in all, they basically traded Tobias Harris, Ilyasova, Oladipo, and Sabonis, for the corpse of Brandon Jennings, Terrence Ross, a 1st that didn't play for them, and Bismack Biyombo."
this dude on the stream im watching called powell Terrence ross lmao
"Listening to Ainge on the radio he knows that we’re not in a position to contend right now but the impression I’m getting is that he’s not using our trade exception until the off season and not in a rush to make any big moves. Have heard names like Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross tossed around as potential additions  Any players we could trade don’t have much value right now imo because nobody’s been playing well consistently other than the 2-3 players we aren’t going to trade. GMs also don’t want to be fleeced so any move we make is going to have to help the other team (sounds obvious) which means losing Smart, Rob and maybe Langford/Nesmith which isn’t ideal   The talent around the league has improved significantly and we haven’t so it seems like a waiting game unfortunately"
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."

Deandre on Knight was really bad. Terrence Ross on Faried was really bad. This dunk was REALLY FUCKING BAD.
"I don't necessarily want us to sell the farm for Vucevic but we have a contending window now and I think we should try to improve. Even with a shorter rotation, I think we still need a solid forward to serve as a bench scorer in order to really compete. We'll have opportunities down the line too but if we can flip a couple picks for a decent wing like Terrence Ross or some of our many young players for other good players, I think it helps us contend short term without having to throw everything at trying to win this year"
Without looking it up I bet there aren’t 5 players who take more contested 3s in the nba than Terrence Ross release is quick
We need Terrence Ross to take 30 shots again
Terrence Ross always loves playing the Knicks for some reason.
"Kevin Martin also scored 40 (at least) once. Or Corey Brewer, or Terrence Ross scoring 50."
OP stated he expanded it to players who averaged at least 15 ppg in 2019-2020. Your boy Terrence Ross averaged 14.7 ppg last season.
"If you've expanded it to 15ppg, Terrence Ross has a career high of 51."

dang it Knicks why did your bench have to be worse then Terrence Ross we're trying to get Cade
"Yep i dont know what point hes trying to make, dude shot 33% and didnt hit a single three, he rebounded well but those arent all star numbers lmao  Terrence Ross and our bad shooting beat the Knicks tonight not Vucevic"
also terrence ross can go fuck himself i hate watching him play like allen fucking iverson for no reason   gg magic im sorry about all the injury woes i really like jonathan isaac and cole anthony

"you could easily make a lowlight reel that looks more damning for quite a number of players, I mean part of OPs argument for how drummond is the ""worst high usage player in the league and its not even close"" includes the fact that he is in the 40th percentile for various offensive metrics which while not good seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of what percentile means if that is the argument you are trying to make.     cursory look through drummond's bref page will show you that this has indeed been his worst season by a considerable margin and even still there isn't much of a statistical argument that he is the worst high usage offensive player in the league this year with the seasons westbrook, dillon brooks, coby white, and terrence ross are having."

He seems kind of like Terrence Ross 2.0 to me.
Not sure why you're down on Green. His shot selection was a big issue in high school and now he's shooting good shots and has his field goal % north of 55%. Better offensive and defensive rating than Kuminga. Admittedly trash assist/turnover ratio but he projects like a better Terrence Ross than a combo guard.
"Orlando running an 8 man rotation of Vucevic, Terrence Ross, Michael Carter-Williams, Mo Bamba, Dwayne Bacon, Gary Clark, Chuma Okeke, and Khem Birch..."

"Not to discredit the Suns (I really like your team and coach), but the Magic are down to eight players, and are missing four starters for extended time. Vucevic and Terrence Ross are the only regular rotation guys without injury. Khem Birch is their third best available player. The Magic should loose every game big"
"Hmmm good point. We get love for development but perhaps you’re right. Derozan at 9 was solid. Of course OG and pascal. Roy hibbert and Terrence Ross were decent. PJ tucker. Mighty Mouse Damon stoudamire. But to be honest, yeah, I wouldn’t place us very high in drafting. Development and evaluation we are killing it (Terrence Davis 3, freddy, Boucher, Norman Powell all G leaguers)"
"People will see this, and automatically talk about Steph, but it’s absolutely crazy the injury bug the Magic have had so far this year. Right now, we are missing out of our starters.  PG - Fultz (Season) SG - Fournier  SF - Isaac (Season) PF - Gordon (6 weeks)  After that, we’re missing   PF2 - Aminu PG2 - Anthony PG3 - MCW PG4 - Frank Mason  Chums Okeke, Mo Bamba, Terrence Ross, etc have all missed time as well.  It’s just so demoralizing starting the season off so well, just to have it explode after nearly every starter and backup is injured"
"We are already the worst shooting team in the league, and we were forced to play lineups of two centers, two power forwards, and a shooting guard, that’s the point.  Having Draymond fill in at guarding the center position is a whole lot easier than asking Terrence Ross, Dwayne Bacon, James Ennis, and Khem Birch to initiate and run your offense.   And that’s not even considering asking centers to match up on small forwards and small forwards to match up on Curry."
Terrence Ross had the weirdest rollercoaster game
Terrence Ross is our MVP for this game
"Definitely Terrence Ross, and again, I didn’t say he was the worst. Far from it. I was just bored and looking for a discussion."
Terrence Ross
Ross is playing like he's Klay but he's Terrence Ross
"Makes me so damn happy.  As a UW grad there's been so much hope for so many guys coming into the NBA, but either they don't pan out, or some bullshit happens like B-Roy's knees, or Isaiah having that insane season with the Celtics and then his body failing him too.  Nate Rob, Terrence Ross, Quincy Pondexter, Tony Wroten, Spencer Hawes, Marquese Chriss.  A lot of 1st round/top 10 picks that had decent careers, but just didn't really seem to work out.  Fultz injury this year fucking sucked, have been looking forward so much to his continued improvement. And I was worried about Dejounte the first year or so.  Now with Dejounte balling the fuck out and Matisse locking people down in Philly, it's looking pretty good finally. Hope Fultz can bounce back again too."
I had a chance to pick this guy up in fantasy and I grabbed Terrence Ross instead. Just another example of me being wrong about everything in life.

We really have our announcers talking about Terrence fucking Ross like he’s Klay Thompson
"PG: Isaiah Thomas  SG: Damian Lillard  SF: Terrence Ross  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Nikola Jokic  Bench: LaMelo Ball, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo"
MCW giveth and MCW taketh.  Live by the MCW die by the MCW.  Chuma is a stud Wendell is a stud (seriously stop wasting our time and give him all of Mo Bamba’s minutes). Best of all with Terrence Ross back no more tank commander Dwayne Bacon.  Actually is that a good thing.  Idk just glad we won a game.
"The Magic without Terrence Ross too, the only above average offensive player they still have lol"
I like to call Dwayne Bacon “We have Terrence Ross at home”
"[The final game the New Jersey Nets ever played](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201204260TOR.html), where both teams (which were both mostly made up of scrubs) were tanking and only played their scrubbiest scrubs, but Ben Fucking Uzoh torpedoed our tank and screwed us out of a better pick (no disrespect to Terrence Ross, he got us Ibaka in the end)"
"NFL is a much more traditional sport and has 1 game series and a way less games  NBA would have parity with that style too, Terrence Ross scores 50 points on your ass that day and you get eliminated   7 game series the best team wins 99.99% of the time, handegg is played like that because players would die if they played long series"
Terrence Ross gives me nightmares
Terrence Ross
"No reason to trade away those guys for a season they're not going to compete in. Trading Oubre for something if they don't plan on re-signing him would be the only move I'd make here.   That also really all depends on who's on the market - trading Oubre + something for someone like Terrence Ross might be a good move, but that all depends on whether teams are looking for salary dumps or what's going on."
"Terrence Ross is the guy I had in mind, but yeah those guys for sure, along with that Niang dude in Utah, and I certainly haven't forgotten The Cameron Payne Game"
Terrence Ross has been solid for them but I get your point
"TJ McConnell, Cedi Osman, Terrence Ross"
So it’s not just Sixers fans that go to sleep with nightmares of Terrence Ross??
Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross would be a huge get for any contender.
Terrence Ross would definitely be on there.
You're right but Terrence Ross against the Miami Heat is basically Michael Jordan incarnate. Every Heat fan is definitely scared when Ross took that shot lmao
Well Terrence Ross scored 31
&gt;who the fuck does terrence ross think he is taking that weird ass shot   Ross was hitting every shot again us with 200% accuracy in the 2nd half. He could've worn blindfolds with complementary handcuffs and I still would've been worried once he took the shot.
"Terrence Ross is literally prime kobe vs us, I was dead scared when he shot that final shot."
"Terrence Ross is called the human torch. THAT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. Dude got a jerry can, poured all over us and lit our ass up. Vucevic did too."
Terrence Ross would get a super max if he played all 82 games against the Heat.
"Vucevic last 4 seasons is 70% at the rim and 50% in the paint non restricted area, and now he's 40% from three lmfao he's so fucking good  who the fuck does terrence ross think he is taking that weird ass shot   also, who the fuck does dwayne bacon think he is taking that that weird ass shot"
Terrence Ross 🔥
Yes. Terrence Ross is a baadman.
"You should throw Isaiah Thomas on the Washington team. Yeah he's probably cooked but in your description you said you're relying on terrence ross being a great scorer, so take a flyer on IT at least on the bench."
"&gt; Based on what?  Based on their defensive skill sets.   &gt; Im telling you what Milwaukee did. They clearly thought Fournier was someone worth targeting on defense, they did it and it worked.   And I’m trying to explain to you why using a 5 game bubble sample for a guy coming off covid who played like shit all around relative to his general standards is an absurd way to judge defensive value. Fournier was targeted in both the milwaukee and Toronto series because of our lack forward depth that meant he had to switch onto or even straight up match up with dudes like siakam, Kawhi, and giannis. That is not an issue for the lakers. In a death lineup scenario the lakers would have AD and Lebron on the floor to guard guys who can physically overpower Fournier.   &gt; Fournier guarding the opponents top option frequently is a byproduct of Orlando's roster not his actual defensive capabilities. Who else is going to chase Dame Lillard around a million screens, Aaron Gordon?  In theory it should be markelle fultz, the 6’4” hyper athletic young point guard. But it’s not because Evan is a very good defender and his size bothers guards a lot on the perimeter. Another funny thing to point out is that you’re saying our perimeter personnel is trash defensively and that’s the only reason Fournier gets the best assignment, but we’ve been a top 10 defense each of the last two years, despite our other back court defenders being Fultz, DJ Augustin, terrence ross, so clearly he’s doing something right. If we were just getting torched on the perimeter every night that couldn’t be true."
"Yeah Barnes would be a perfect fit for our team but he has to come at the right price.   If not, we could get someone like Terrence Ross and then PJ Tucker without giving up much at all. That gives us the role players for this season and let's us keep developing the kids so they're ready to be  contributors later down the track when Tatum/Brown are looking at contract extensions."
I think that's OP's idea but I don't think that's what would happen in actuality. I think realistically you get teams playing 4 out super small heavy shooting lineups with 1 big rim protector. Unlike when the 3 second previously didn't exist there are now tons of shooters. Like I think we may see someone like Terrence Ross playing the 4 while Aaron Gordon is basically out of the league.
Terrence Ross on the Magic  Raptors fan.
"Terrence Ross, patty mills, joe ingles"
I heard Terrence Ross is available
Terrence Ross
"terrence ross, garrison mathews, malik monk"
Fitz hates volume scoring role players. He's the same with Terrence Ross lol
Mikael Pietrus would be Terrence Ross
Sexton does nothing in terms of rebounds and assists and is not a great defender.   He takes the 17th most shots in the NBA. More than Lebron/Young/KD/Kawhi/PG. If you let Terrence Ross shoot that much he could wrack up 24.5 ppg too. I don't even know how its possible to play as many minutes as he does and only average 3 rebounds.
"We have no idea what the Magic future looks like, but I’m relatively optimistic about it. have 2 tops 10 picks this year in a deep draft, 3 first rounders playing this year , 2 of which have looked good in extended minutes in okeke and Anthony. A dpoy contender if he can stay healthy in Isaac. Wendell Carter has played well since coming over, bamba has shown improvement finally recently. And still have a great 6th man in Terrence Ross and a max contract slot the off season after the 21-22 season. That’s a lot of assets that could go one way or the other."
"Never forget Mo Williams, Terrence Ross, or Corey Brewer's 50 point games"
"If you want to highlight the best shooters, then just make a list by ""shot making.""  Using a Y axis that's half determined by the X axis creates a strong y=-x bias that conveys less information.  For example, a guy like Terrence Ross--who takes absurdly difficult shots and has a poor 3P%--should be an outlier in the corner of the chart instead of buried under James Harden."
"Before that was BRoy, Spencer Hawes, Martell Webster (from Seattle and was supposed to go to UW before he went pro), IT, Justin Holiday, Terrence Ross, and Dejounte Murray. Most of them were local guys on top of all that. Guess you can also include players like Lavine, Joe Harris, Kevin Porter Jr., etc.  Crazy how we still don’t have a team even when we’re putting out the type of talent that we are here in the PNW."
Terrence Ross and mj
Terrence Ross
You aren’t the only one.  Fuck patty mills  Fuck Jeff green  Fuck Terrence Ross  Fuck PJ Washington   And a lot of others.
"False, Terrence Ross did a great one years ago"
"Athletic players who can shoot like Terrence Ross, JR Smith, etc"
"kid scored 50 big whoop. terrence ross scored 50 lmao, stop acting like kpj is harden jr"
Terrence Ross gotta be in the MVP conversation
That’s it!!! I’ve seen enough. Build around Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross drafted with DeRozan already on the team.
"I watched him get kicked out of a rec game hosted by Terrence Ross a few years ago, dudes a hot head"
Wiseman for Terrence Ross
"He was fantastic in Orlando. Obviously not going to bring a lot of scoring, but defense, offensive rebounding, and screening were excellent. If you watched the first half of our season almost every single signature Terrence Ross catch and shoot 3 came off a screen from Birch. I even bought his jersey this year because he is the definition of grit. As sad as I was to see him go it was still best for both parties since we needed Bamba to get some minutes just so that we can actually decide if he’s going to be an NBA player or not."
Magic are legit one of the scariest teams for a Nets fan. Vooch would always go off for crazy stat lines and then Fournier and Terrence Ross would take turns getting incredibly hot for random games against us.
"@joshuabrobbins: The Magic will start Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Dwayne Bacon, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba tonight against the Pelicans in Orlando. Wendell Carter Jr., Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis, Otto Porter Jr. and Terrence Ross will not play."
Terrence ross
Terrence Ross. Im pretty convinced hes just not a player that fits on a good team but if i see him have one of those games where his dumbass shots are all going in for another team I will be extremely sad
"Laughs in Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, MCW, James Ennis, Mo Bamba, Terrence Ross, Otto Porter JR (I don’t even remember when he got hurt), and pretty much anyone not named Dwayne freaking Bacon.  Dwayne Bacon can survive a nuclear catastrophe unscathed.  That man will not get hurt or sick,  he’s the true iron man of the NBA."
"&gt;Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...? Man   You just listed quite a few terrific players. Would be by far the best best in the league"
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."
"Other than Terrence Ross &amp; Mo Bamba, other fanbases probably know MORE about our current team than our own fans do"
"Yeah I agree. I wouldn't mind Mobley and think he might be the best fit tbh outside going Cade if we get number one.  I wonder what the  team does if Wolves unfortunately miss out in the lottery. They will need more experience in the frontcourt regardless, but they should try to look for a good versatile PG or two-guard.  Someone like Terrence Ross in Orlando could be interesting."
"One word keeps playing in my mind as I watch quietly in the background this NBA season. Disrespect. Disrespect for Hartenstein's game, his skill, his impact. People treating him like he's not a NBA caliber player. People thinking rookie's are better than him. It's all so very disrespectful. Let's make one thing very Clear. Hartenstein will make the Hall of Fame. He is that GREAT.  **THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOT PLAYING AND PLAYING BADLY.**  For young players it doesn't matter how many minutes you get, it only matters what you do with the playing time you do get. Hartenstein in his career has only played 6 games over 20 minutes. In those games he was 5-1 with a plus minus of +88. The last time Hartenstein played 20 minutes in a game Hartenstein had 17/15/1/2stls/5blks shooting 89% from the field in only 26 minutes of play. Hart was a +39. Now, I want to put that specific stat line in perspective. For one, it's the only time in NBA history a player put up at least 17/15/5blks/2stls on 89% shooting, but more than that, it's the +39 that is unreal. Jokic's career high plus minus is +38. Hartenstein in 26 minutes put up a higher plus minus than Jokic's career high. But it's not just Jokic. Lebron's career high plus minus was also +39. Think about the greatness of Lebron, his longevity, his dominance. Think about how many absolutely terrible teams Lebron has played over his career. Only once was Lebron as dominate from a plus minus perspective as Hartenstein that night.  If this was only a one time thing I wouldn't really care. Many players have fluke historic games. Booker dropped 73, Cory Brewer and Terrence Ross dropped 50. I'm sure if you look though history you will find plus minus performances better than Hart and Lebron's career high. But here's the important detail. It's NOT a one time thing. Hartenstein is constantly a positive helping his team win games. This season **Isaiah Hartenstein leads the Denver Nuggets in net rating.** Not Jokic, not Murray, HARTENSTEIN. When Hartenstein plays the Nuggets are WINNING. The Nuggets are 7-1 when Hartenstein plays more than 11 minutes. Hart is a +64 in those games.  So the obvious question is HOW? How is it Hartenstein is leading the Nuggets in net rating? From a eye test prospective he's been struggling. One word my friend. **DEFENSE.** Requiring at least 25 games played **Isaiah Hartenstein leads all centers in defensive rating.** Hart is averaging 3.3 blocks and 2.1 steals per 100 possessions. Hart is the only player in the NBA that averages 3+ blocks and 2+ steals per100 possessions while being positive in the plus minus. To put those stats into prospective, Kevin Garrett only Averaged 3 blocks and 2 steals per 100 possessions once in his NBA career, the year he won MVP. Isaiah Hartenstein leads the Nuggets in net rating because he's currently playing defense at a similar level to MVP KG. [quick highlight of what I'm talking about](https://streamable.com/n5spcy)  **In Hartenstein Prime he could win DPOY.** That said I'm not sure this level of defense will keep up. This level of defense is probably a simple a flash of what Hartenstein could become defensively. Kind of like how Jokic showed flashes of averaging triple doubles when he was 22-23 years old. We might see some regression defensively, but any regression defensively will be more than compensated for what Hartenstein will give the Nuggets offensively.  Hartenstein has been in a horribly timed shooting slump, Hart is shooting just 53% at the rim (he shot 79% at the rim last season), the game is still fast for him. However Hart will improve dramatically with playing time. I know this because it's not the first time Hartenstein has been in a shooting slump in limited minutes. When Hartenstein played with the Rockets, in the games Hart played less than 15 minutes he averaged per36 11/6/1stl/1blk shooting 51% from the field. Hartenstein struggles when he doesn't get constant playing time. Because **Hartenstein never gets constant playing time**, all people see are the struggles. They don't see what happens when he gets playing time. In the Games Hartenstein played more than 15 minutes he averaged per36 17/16/2blks/1stl shooting 75% from the field. When Hartenstein gets playing time he does the same thing he did in the G-League. Dominates.  The main thing that prompted this post was the last two Nuggets games I saw back to back. The Nuggets played the Grizzles and then Played the Mavericks. One game Hartenstein played, the other game Hartenstein didn't. Jokic, Barton and MPJ played great in both games, Murray Struggled in both games. one game the Nuggets won, the other they were blown out. This back to back was the perfect microcosm of Hartenstein's value as a player.  Hart was the only bench player positive in the plus minus during the Grizzles game, he had 2 blocks and 1 steal in 11 minutes of play. Hartenstein had a defensive rating of 65 in that game. The Nuggets couldn't hit anything, Murray shot 7% in the game, Campazzo was missing open threes, Dozier was 1 of 6. Jokic was coming out after the Grizzles hit an unbelievable deep three to cut the lead to 4. When Jokic came back at the 6 minute mark, the lead was still 4. Nuggets end up winning by one point. Hartenstein didn't take a shot during that stretch, but what he did do is contest every shot, he got deflections steals, blocks. Hartenstein didn't foul. If the Grizzlies went on a run during that stretch jokic was out the Nuggets would have lost. As such **Hartenstein play won the Grizzlies game**  Comparatively, The Nuggets played a back to back against the Mavericks. Malone choose to go with the 20 year old rookie Nnaji instead of Hartenstein and that decision lost the game. Now understand Nnaji is a good player, he can put the ball in the basket and I think he will be in the NBA for a long time. But he is not ready for NBA rotation minutes without Hartenstein or Jokic backing him up. In the Minutes Nnaji plays without Jokic or Hart the Nuggets are -30 net rating. Again Nnaji is good, but he's a rook and he plays like a rook. In this Mavericks game, once then Nuggets put in Nnai the Nuggets gave up layups. So many layups the Nuggets lost the momentum and by the time Jokic came back in the game he couldn't stop the bleeding. The Mavs are too good to not play Isaiah Hartenstein.  So where do we go from here? I want to give advice to 3 people. Malone, Nuggets Fans, and Hartenstein himself.  **For Malone:** I want you to know that I love you. I love your coaching style and I respect you. Truly. Both Jokic and Hartenstein were second round picks, but you gave Jokic a real opportunity to show his talent. You said ""I wouldn't trade Jokic for anybody in the world"" when Jokic was a rookie. Without that opportunity you gave Jokic I don't know where the Nuggets would be. Hartenstein didn't get that opportunity, he was instead sent to the G-League. Hartenstein dominated the G-League, he was the youngest G-League finals MVP in history. His reward for playing great? getting cut. So my advice to you Malone is nothing crazy, just play Hartenstein the same minutes you would have given Plumlee. Hartenstien is not Plumlee, he's much better. But still, that's all he needs. Plumlee never played less than ten minutes, never play Hartenstein less than ten minutes. Let the Young player grow.  **For Nuggets Fans:** Have patience. I understand that Hartenstein doesn't look the best right now. I understand he fouls a lot, I understand he is shooting really bad at the rim. But the Numbers don't lie. When Hartenstein plays basketball the Nuggets are a better team than when Jokic plays basketball. That is not an opinion, that is a fact. MPJ had a 0/8 shooting game, he's still a clear STAR. Hartenstein is the same age as MPJ and should be treated with the same level of understanding. The fouls will end, the finishing will come, and Hartenstein Greatness will begin.  **For Hartenstein:** I believe in you. At times it must feel like no one does. Like no one understands how versatile and great you can be. **Don't give up.** Keep working, keep grinding. Your time will come. hopefully with the Nuggets but if not, that's fine too. Isaiah **YOU ARE GREAT. YOU ARE AMAZING. YOU WILL WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS**"
"1 assist a game is hilarious. That's Brandon ""No Pass"" Bass levels of unwillingness to give up the ball. Even terrence ross lucks into 2 assists a game"
I love Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross beat you to it
Terrence Ross is a great follow lmao
Terrence Ross is a great follow lmao
How am I exaggerating? [He did the same shit to Terrence Ross](https://streamable.com/xmdooh) because he didn't get a whistle.  And he has an entire compilation of frustration fouls on YT you can watch anytime if you cared.
"This dude needs to relax with these fouls. Smacked the shit outta Terrence Ross when we played them, and of course Terrence was confused as shit"
Terrence Ross doesn’t play for the Kings. He plays for Orlando.
"Find a Center, either draft or FA and then proceed to watch them suck.  If Bagley hasn't been traded, pray he doesn't get hurt.  Keep Terrence Ross  Hopefully Buddy gets traded, if not, well fuck."
"I don't necessarily think the league is in a bad spot talent wise. I do think, however, that the talent pool is already diluted and that exacerbates the league's bigger problem, which is that it's regular season is increasingly meaningless and far too long (even as much as I love basketball).  I certainly see your point about one star per team and how removing the league's bottom 100 would impact them. That said, I think you have to question how many of those stars are only such because they are the only player on a relatively talentless team? Consider the Orlando Magic--a team devoid of a superstar (as it traded away its top players). Is Terrence Ross--perhaps the team's current best player--really a guy who can drop 15 points per game, or is he doing so because, well, somebody has to shoot? His 41 percent shooting percentage suggests more of the latter than the former.  And since we're on the Magic, let's consider them as another example of the league's talent dilution. The team traded away three talented players--Vucevic, Fournier, and Gordon--to start a rebuild. Those three players, as talented as they are, were not enough to lift an otherwise mediocre team out of its depths. There's two ways you view this, I suppose. I'd imagine you'd say this is evidence that the league's talent is so great that three otherwise good players weren't enough to make the team competitive. I'd argue that the Magic simply weren't talented at all and that those three players would be better served on more competitive teams.  Last point: that the Magic have to rebuild via the draft is really an indication that there's not enough talent in the league to justify its existence. By getting rid of the only talent it had, the Magic has essentially committed to a three-to-four year rebuild through the draft. Now you could argue--with some validity--that fewer teams wouldn't necessarily prevent teams from tanking/rebuilding. However, do we really want more teams tanking/rebuilding, which is what will happen if there's 32?"
"Ariza is getting $12.8m now. Millsap got a $10m. Terrence Ross is making about $13m.   Someone will overpay, say $15-17.5m, thinking they can slide him in as the second or third guy on a potential push team. But if he wants a chip, he'll end up with the MLE."
"I’ll go contract-by-contract and defend them:  * Brogdon: I can see taking Bogi, they’re about equal in contract and ability. But Brogdon can match Bogi’s scoring and defense while also being a better passer. * Turner is a DPOY caliber player and one of the league’s best shot blockers, he single-handedly carried the Pacers defense this year. Definitely taking him over Bogi. * Capela is also a phenomenal defender, but he’s also one of the league’s top rebounders and a menace in the PNR. For me, he’s easily a top ten C in the league, and this isn’t even close. * Rose is a 6MOTY caliber guy who massively helped the Knicks go on their run to the four seed. If he and Bogi were on the same contracts, I’d take Bogi, but $7m a year for what Rose has done is phenomenal. Rose could easily get a $15m-$20m contract in the open market IMO. * Noel should be All-Defense first team. He’s a really, really good defender. For $5m a year (barely more than the VetMin), that’s hard to beat. * I could see taking Bogi over Monte Morris because of the talent gap, but $9m a year is just so cheap for a starting-level PG. I could see this one coming down to team need. * O’Neal is one of the league’s best 3 and D guys and a key role player for the Jazz. I could see him being worth Joe Harris money and getting a contract in the $16m-$18m a year range. * Kleber is a good defender, but I can see taking Bogi over him.  * DFS’s shot seems to come and go, but he’s a solid defender, decent rebounder, and $4m a year is a pittance. * Ibaka is a solid all-around, decent shooter, good defender, and has slightly improved every year he’s been in the league. He was on $16m a year with the Raptors and reportedly turned down an extension in that range to go contend in LA.  For me personally, Bogi’s $18m a year is about what he’s worth. His scoring hasn’t been proven consistent, though he’s been on fire of late- earlier in the season, people were bashing his contract as being on an overpay. If he can keep up this kind of scoring, then he’s worth more, but, if you look at the contracts of, Terry Rozier, TJ Warren, Caris Levert, or Terrence Ross, I think $18m a year is about right for a good-shooting/streaky scoring second guy."
Terrence Ross.
A 3 pt shooter who also has hops.   I thought of Seth Curry but he doesn't get up like that.  Danny Green? Terrence Ross has bounce and can shoot.
"Corey Brewer, Mo Williams, Terrence Ross, Tony Delk, Brandon Jennings, Andre Miller all have 50-point games to their names"
"It's going to be really interesting to see how much Tim Hardaway Jr., Norm Powell and Gary Trent Jr. all get this offseason.  Similar sizes &amp; player profiles between all of them, Trent is younger than Norm/THJ but has the least off-the-bounce juice of the trio (plus he's an RFA).  I think all 3 could be getting Jerami Grant $$$ when it comes down to it.  Makes someone like Terrence Ross look like a bargain (he's not as good as any of these 3 but will be making ""only"" $12.5M next year and $11.5M in 22-23)"
Terrence Ross. Thought he'd be better than DeRozan.
"Kenneth farrieds crowning moments in his career are, the Olympic run where he actually looked real good, and getting fucking DUUUNKED on by Terrence Ross.  Still the most filthy poster I've ever seen"

"Otto Porter Jr is probably gone, and most of the random injury fill-ins we signed, so Chasson Randle, Ignas Brazdeikis, Donta Hall, Sindarius Thornwell. Strictly speaking, Mo Wagner is in that category, but I think we'll keep him.   I think we also probably will trade one of Gary Harris or Terrence Ross at some point."

"What's the best draft class currently in the NBA? 2003 always good until Lebron retires - ridiculous (Melo not doing anything noteworthy anymore).

&gt;but Simmons is also barely a top 20 player. Same as Butler.  Ok then you can judge them equally? There was literally no point for you to add that in you just wanted to shit on Butler again lmao.  Acting like this bucks team isnt absolutely balanced and complete as well gtfo.   And no. There are still 15 ppg off the bench players thatre considered role players. For example Terrence Ross.

"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."

1. Magic-Terrence Ross
"I appreciate it, thanks dude! I guess to give myself perspective, it’d be like saying “If Terrence Ross came to Portland would more people become blazers fans” lol kind of a dumb take"
"While Jonathan Isaac is a good shot blocker, Terrence Ross is too. Ross is also a good slasher and 3pt shooter. Plus it may be biased a little cause I love watching him play and don’t care that much for Jonathan Isaac."
"Terrence Ross over Jonathan Isaac, Julius Randle over Derrick Rose and Pascal Siakam over Kyle Lowry. The other 27 I agree with."
"Would the Magic and Lakers consider a Kyle Kuzma for Terrence Ross swap? Magic are rebuilding and loading up on young pieces, while Ross would be a great fit as the third scorer for the Lakers.   **Lakers:** KCP, Ross, Bron, AD, some centre?   **Magic young talent depth chart:**  PG: Fultz, Anthony.  SG: Hampton, hopefully BJ Boston at 33.  SF: Kuzma, Franz Wagner.  PF: Kuminga, Okeke.   C: WCJ, Bamba."
Jalen Green will be nothing more than another Terrence Ross or JR Smith. Watch this space
Nobody but you have a real thin roster and I like shouting Isaac when I can since I think he’s a DPoY level stud so I tried to sneak him in haha.  Who should I swap the 2nd/3rd best on your roster to?  I assume it’d be Terrence Ross and someone else?
"Terrence Ross has some nice ones in-game, looks like he just glides through the air"
Terrence Ross had a statline of 35/0/0/0/0 in 34 mins vs. Miami last season
Kind of a weird one but terrence ross lol. In the sense that if he sees half a centimetre space hes launching it
"I was born in 95 so my lists are largely biased towards modern NBA players. I know it's not fair to legends but, unlike most on this sub, I don't really rank players I didn't watch week in week out. You can make Terrence Ross look like Jordan off highlight reels."
"That's true. There's some argument that it would've been better to hold onto Russ, rehabilitate his value, then trade him for maybe expirings and a 1st, or at least better contracts and a 1st. That approach has been great for OKC. But you right, it wasn't as bad as I made it sound.  The real double stinker was the Magic's ibaka trades. They gave up Oladipo and Sabonis to get Ibaka, only to trade him for Terrence Ross and a later 1st. Meanwhile the guys they started with turned into Paul George!"
"Not to a crazy extent, but Terrence Ross started spelling words like colour with a u cause thats the Canadian spelling and would listen to canadian music like rush. Cool to see someone take an interest like that"
"I’m a white dude, I identify more with Terrence Ross (an American that’s from Portland) than Luka or Jokic, two white dudes from Eastern Europe lmao.   I can see white guys identifying with like Steve Nash cuz they see him in themselves, but what the fuck do I have in common with a seven footer from Serbia 🤣"
Terrence Ross since 2018
&gt;If you put a true number one option (one capable of winning a championship as a number one option) they would still be able to do it on high efficiency   Playing next to DJ Augustin and Terrence Ross?
"Isaac.  Fultz,  Cole Anthony is pretty good.  Terrence Ross.  Gary Harris is the main defensive reason Denver beat Utah in the bubble.  Wendell Carter JR so yeah, we aren’t the least talented team in the NBA.  Teams may have a better top player than us like the Kings or the Rockets or Pistons.  But overall I’d take our team as a whole over them."
Terrence Ross is such an enigma. He can do it all but never put it together consistently enough to be a great player.
"2019 Jaxson Hayes, Texas – New Orleans Pelicans   2018 Collin Sexton, Alabama – Cleveland Cavaliers  2017 Frank Ntilikina, France – New York Knicks  2016 Marquese Chriss, Washington – Sacramento Kings  2015 Stanley Johnson, Arizona – Detroit Pistons  2014 Nik Stauskas, Michigan – Sacramento Kings  2013 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Georgia – Detroit Pistons  2012 Terrence Ross, Washington – Toronto Raptors  2011 Brandon Knight, Kentucky – Detroit Pistons  2010 Al-Farouq Aminu, Wake Forest – L.A. Clippers  The #8 picks have been dreadful for the last decade. You really gotta get lucky to end up in the top 4 and draft someone good. This year was their chance."
I think my message didn’t come off as motivating as I had intended. Sorry. I would say that at times Vuc and Gordon looked like stars that could have been trade pieces. I like Orlando and I hope good things are coming. I also love Terrence Ross. Good dude.
"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
"I don’t think you can call it a lost art. 21.3% of Booker’s points these playoffs are from midrange. Of players with at least 4 games and 15 plus mpg, six guys have a higher percentage of their points from midrange than that, nine last year with a higher percentage than Booker’s now, and eleven the year before.  This year its CP3, KD, Beal, Ish Smith, D’Andre Hunter, and Carmelo in that order.  Last postseason, it was Carmelo, Middleton, Seth, CP3, Markell’s Fultz, Gallinari, Terrence Ross, Trey Burke, and Tyler Johnson.  Luke Kennard, Demar, Monte Morris, Collison, Schroeder, Myles Turner, Ish Smith, Aldridge, KD, Lou, and Klay were the ones in 2019."
There's a chance Terrence Ross will be on the trading block.  He's exactly what Philly need.  Not sure what they could give us though that would be of interest to our FO.
Terrence Ross + #33? Lol
Terrence Ross and Gary Harris
Why hasn’t Terrence Ross been given a max contract even after he scored 51 points that one time?  The answer to that question and the answer to why Maxey wasn’t given more minutes are very similar.
whatever happened to terrence ross? dude won the dunk contest that one year and looked like he was set out to be a star
"The worst part of it to me is that he's not just chucking off the catch like Terrence Ross, he'd usually fuck around with the for half the clock with the other 9 players on the court being under no illusion that he's gonna do anything besides shoot."
I’m surprised it wasn’t mentioned but Terrence Ross had 51pts off the bench while averaging 9ppg.
They are a part of my heart because of Terrence Ross (raptors fan) and the fact that we beat them during our title run. They are part of that history.
"I feel like for Orlando you could say they don't have a ""franchise player"". It's probably Terrence Ross' team but they don't have that guy that is their franchise player just yet Cole Anthony and Isaac just arent it just yet"
Terrence Ross murdered him on a fast break and he was never the same again.
Steve Nash. Gary Payton. Terrence Ross. Zach Randolph. Walt Bellamy.
"How about Orlando as a 3rd team? Something like this:  Minnesota receives: Ben Simmons  Philly receives: Patrick Beverly, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Gary Harris, Minnesota 2024 1st Rounder, Minnesota 2026 1st Rounder  Orlando receives: Minnesota 2022 1st Rounder, Minnesota 2024 2nd Rounder, throw in players to make salaries work.  It's a decent start I think"
Terrence Ross is good for a 30/0/0/0/0 statline on lights out shooting off the bench whenever the Magic play the Heat

That's a great way to overrate someone. One night the stars aligned and Terrence Ross scored 51. That's not a good measure of his worth as a player.
Terrence Ross isn’t a power forward but not trading for power forwards hasn’t stopped you guys before.
"I could believe Terrence Ross randomly popping off for a 50 point game, the dude can shoot the 3 with the best of them on his hot days  Corey Brewer made only 2 3s in that 51-point game and was a mediocre shooter from deep for his career, most of his buckets vs the Rockets were literally just him rim-running for layups or drawing fouls."
Terrence Ross would like a word
"The ""average"" NBA player is not a starter.  15 players under contract only 5 start.  So I'm thinking the 7th man.  The answer is most probably dependent on the players age and potential to grow, but assuming for this example he is 28-30 years old or so and off the rookie pay scale.  I'm going to go with Terrence Ross as the perfect example:  signed for $12.5M this year, $11.5 next"
"Please don’t tell me Terrence Ross is the Magic’s second best player, surely there has to be someone besides Isaac better than him??"
Embiid to Terrence Ross is a drag too
"Do you think Terrence ross is an all time great because he dropped 50 once or is he merely good? Devin booker had 2 40 pt games yes but that's not the entire series.  And to be honest chris Paul was better in that finals than devin booker. Shot better, facilitated the offence, plays defense. Also doesn't play hero ball"
anyone good enough to make Terrence Ross look like an All-Star should be an All-Star themselves lol
they still miss terrence ross
"Credit to OP for the awesome structure and idea.  Starting LineUp:  PG: Kemba Walker 10  SG: James Harden 38  SF: LeBron James 39  PF: Marcus Morris 12  C: Nerlens Noel 8  Bench:  Guards: Grayson Allen 4  Wings: Josh Hart 6  Bigs: Bobby Portis 3  First of all I wanted to say awesome job OP, definitely looks like you worked hard on this list and I like it. Also, side note I think you mistook Troy Brown Jr for Bruce Brown Jr. I probably spent more time than I should’ve at this so I hope you guys enjoy.  Anyways, for my team. I went with the approach that’s been working most for basically the past decade and more now, LeBron plus shooting and playmaking.  Team Reasons:  My strategy was picking up guys who I thought was the best bang for your buck, who I thought were huge steals and honestly I think a lot of these guys are undervalued.  Kemba Walker for 10 is a steal, this is still someone with excellent on ball and off ball guard ability who can average 20ish PPG in that role doing so. He can take pressure off Harden &amp; LeBron.  James Harden is I think the best SG in the game and his scoring and playmaking ability never to someone like LeBron would be amazing like we’ve seen similarly with Chris Paul in the past. He’d make everyone around him better and scores with ease.  LeBron James age may hurt him but I’m a strong believer in him. I think he’ll still be as good as ever and at the very highest a step slower but that’s still a damn good player. His playmaking ability next to this team will be huge.  Marcus Morris for 12 is a huge steal. He averaged 20ish PPG on the Knicks and is an amazing shooter who’s proven he can play with multiple wings as a small ball C or a wing in general.  Nerlens Noel is someone who I think can thrive as a starter especially next to James Harden. His defence is definitely good enough to sustain a starting spot.  Bench:  Grayson Allen I think is someone who you undervalued OP because he was a starter on a playoff team who averaged 11 PPG shooting lights out from 3, 39% making 2 a game. He also has good enough playmaking ability and to do stuff off the dribble.  Bobby Portis per 36 stats last season he was second in the league in points off the bench and first in rebounding for 3 BP is amazing. Good floor spacer too if Nerlens isn’t playing well.  Josh Hart or Terrence Ross I couldn’t decide between. They’re the same price but I’m not sure if Ross as a 6th man is a better fit or Hart as a small ball lineup player. I think id go with Hart because of his rebounding even though TRoss is a bigger name.  I think this team has the perfect amount of playmaking, scoring, floor spacing and just enough defence to help them. I’d honestly say this is the best team anyone can come up with but I do not wanna get ahead of myself."
"I don’t necessarily agree but fine. Assuming we take your premise, given your definition, our last lottery pick was Poetl(2016) Before that it was Terrence Ross(2012).   Both of which are solid players(Poetl might still be TBD), but neither of them have flamed out. I also don’t recall us being “irrationally hyped” for these two players and jerking them off.   I don’t understand why then, based on our lottery drafting, you’re so insistent on a player who’s played 2 games in the summer league that he must be a bust. Was there something you saw during his college games that you felt made him a bust?"
Terrence Ross gonna have PTSD watching this lmao
"Why is it pretentious though? He was the best player on a team that was consistently winning 50 games there are only a handful of guys in the league you can say that about. in 15-16 the Raps won 56 games. Their top 8 guys in the rotation were Lowry, Demar, Carroll, JV, Cory Joseph, Patrick Patterson, Bismack Biyombo, and Terrence Ross. OKC had Durant, Westbrook, Serge and Adams and won 55."

NBA Superstar Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross had amber rose in Toronto 🤷
"Lol. Okay.  First round picks for Bargnani and Vasquez.  Serge Ibaka for Terrence Ross  OG at 20  Siakam at 27  FVV undrafted  Best draft record over the last decade.  Best development program.  Grooming arguably the best second exec in Bobby Webster.  Hired Nick Nurse over more experienced candidates.  Kawhi trade without giving up anyone good.   Foresight to see how Gasol would transform them.  Championship in Toronto.  And thats just the quick, off the top if my head list  Hes one of the best, and anyone who says otherwose has no idea what they are talking about."
"We need some vets, we literally have 3 dudes on the team (not including RoLo) above the age of 23, and only Terrence Ross is (barely) in his 30s."
https://www.spotrac.com/nba/orlando-magic/terrence-ross-10816/
Terrence Ross?
"Masai just on the Raptors  (discounting the Melo trade in Denver that was amazing and the Kawhi trade because we all know):  - Traded Bargnani's awful contract for a lottery pick    used to select Jakob Poeltl.   - Traded Greivis Vasquez to the Bucks for 2 picks that turned into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell.   - Signed Fred VanVleet to an undrafted deal.   - Traded Valanciunas, Wright and picks for an old Marc Gasol so we could win. Morey refused to do this for Lowry and that's why Sixers couldn't go further.    - Traded Terrence Ross and a second for Serge Ibaka.     - Drafted Pascal Siakam #27 when few had heard of him.    - Fired Casey and hired a largely unknown Nick Nurse.     Masai is a tier above Morey. He has had elite moves i  trades, drafts and coaching hires. They shouldn't be discussed in the same breath."
Take a drink every time Terrence Ross shoots a contested three
"OP was making the point that shooting poorly pre-NBA is clear evidence they wont shoot well in the NBA. Just because they shot poorly pre-NBA doesnt mean they cant develop a shot in the NBA and came off with the tone that ""it should be obvious.""  For example, Kyle Lowry shot 36% from the field his rookie season (yes I understand Lowry also wasn't a Reddish style HS recruit)  I'm not saying Cam is going to live up to his HS hype of being a future star or anything, but I think there are solid reasonings many people think he'll be a solid NBA player beyond the current struggles or why he shouldnt immediately be written off.  Terrence Ross is another example - he wasn't as highly rated as Reddish was, but by all accounts he was a top 30 HS recruit, had a bad freshman year in college, was a top 10 pick in the draft, and had a pretty terrible first couple years in the NBA. But most people consider him a solid NBA role player at the moment."
Who had the better 50-piece? Corey Brewer or Terrence Ross?
I see your Andre Miller and raise you one Terrence Ross
"Fultz is still recovering from an ACL injury and I doubt we move him while he recovers unless we get a crazy offer. Which I doubt. Let’s see how Suggs, Anthony and Hampton fit in the meantime and then figure everything out when Markelle is healthy. Someone has to end up traded eventually as we identify the best of the bunch and the player(s) to build around but I see no reason to rush Fultz out the door while he is injured tbh.   Terrence Ross and Gary Harris are the ones likely to be dealt this offseason. Ross has more value but Harris is on the last year of his deal and is better off as a role player on a contending team."
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
"Even with Ross and Delon, they were packaged for Ibaka and Gasol which led to the chip.  The only player drafted after Ross within reason you can argue for is Drummond and with JV already on the roster (and JV being better than Drummond) it was the right pick. The ten picks after Drummond were Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, Mo Harkless, Royce White, Tyler Zeller, Terrence Jones and Andrew Nicholson. Getting Ross is a W for Masai and the Raptors.  With Delon, he was drafted 20th so getting someone who was a first guard off the bench player is a good return on that. The players drafted after him in the first round were Justin Anderson, Bobby Portis, Rondae, Tyus Jones,  Jarrell Martin, Nikola Milutinov, Larry Nance Jr, RJ Hunter, Chris McCullough and Kevon Looney. Other than Looney, Delon is good return based on the picks after, I don't consider this a miss.  Bruno was a miss no doubt though. But hey, we got the Raptors 905 built up because of him so in the grand scheme of things it worked out lol  So yeah, **basically** (key word basically) all our picks have hit. Other than Bruno we haven't missed a pick."
"You can always count on the Raptors to make a surprise pick lol, regardless of GM. Rafael Araujo, Charlie Villanueva, Andrea Bargnani, Terrence Ross, Bruno Caboclo, Scottie Barnes."
"They have so many guards now. Suggs, Hampton, Cole, Gary Harris, Terrence Ross, MCW, Dwayne Bacon. I suppose the last four aren't really a part of their future though."
"You can always count on the Raptors to make a surprise pick lol, regardless of GM. Rafael Araujo, Charlie Villanueva, Andrea Bargnani, Terrence Ross, Bruno Caboclo, Scottie Barnes."
Sengun will wind up useless in the NBA just like Sabonis will and just like Kanter has.  Green will be another Terrence Ross/JR Smith   1 - Cade 2 - Mobley 3 - Barnes 4 - Sugges 5 - Trey Murphy
K but this is Terrence Ross
Shit I wouldn’t mind picking up Terrence Ross. Can’t be a super RSHK if you’re ON the heat now can ya *taps temple*
50 point scorer terrence ross
I heard he's going to the magic to pair up with Terrence ross
"Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Terrence Ross, Brandon Knight...  Yeah, out of the last 10 Sexton is almost the only one who's turned into a really good player. Ross and KCP are tidy, but nothing special."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1936756-terrence-ross-ties-toronto-raptors-record-with-51-point-game
Terrence Ross.
Yeah i thought about it the worst player you can find who ever dropped 50 in a game is some variation of Terrence Ross/Tony Delk/Corey Brewer. There's no way of really gauging this but if you can do something this extreme even in a one game sample sizes the odds that you have a high enough baseline skill set to at least be a rotation player seem reasonable. If I were his agent no way in hell would I let him sign anything for more than 2 yrs though.
Worst 50 point players I could find are these two.  Walt Wesley only averaged 8.5 PPG but had a 50 point game. '75-'76 was his last season.  For active players Terrence Ross has a 50 point game and averages 11.4 over his career.
"It really depends on the circumstances and everything but that's hard to say. But I wouldn't expect too big of a contract I'd say like $5m honestly.. Terrence Ross, Corey Brewer, Tony Delk, etc. have scored 50 in a game. This hypothetical guy, there's a reason he went undrafted and coming out of Gonzaga it's not like he's an unknown. 1 monster game doesn't automatically change everything.  Somewhat similar although nowhere near that, Jordan McRae put up 36/7/4 in the last game of the year a couple years ago. He was then in the G League the next season and waived later that year"
Idk how the contracts could match up but I’d take 28 and an equivalent contract for Terrence Ross.
"Yup exactly. Because no one is trading for Sexton, they are trading for the right to pay Sexton like 100 million, and that’s probably not worth a lottery pick.      If I’m the Cavs I’d rather move Love and Sexton together for like Terrence Ross and Mo Bamba than trade Sexton for like the 16th pick and keep Love on the bench."
TRADE OFFER  Orlando gets:  All the crazy GOP fuckers from Wisconsin  Milwaukee gets:  Terrence Ross
TERRY STOTTS/TERRENCE ROSS
"I will take number 3 and Kevin Love for 5, the Denver Pick and the Chicago 23 pick plus Gary Harris and Terrence Ross please."
"Worst play...  Either the entirety of the 2015 run, or there was this game it was the Raptors vs Kings and [Terrence Ross' game-tying three](https://youtu.be/VCgrN5q3-3I) was nullified because the refs thought DeMarcus Cousins tipped it and felt there wasn't enough time left.  Even though if you factor in the clock starting on Cousins contact with the ball, there still woulda been enough time for it to count."
"Improve the bench in a variety of ways. Namely, getting a bucket getter that isn’t just a spot up shooter (see Bryn Forbes). I think the perfect player to fill this role would be Terrence Ross, and he should be easy to get from the Magic since he doesn’t fit their timeline. Bench defense could also be improved, since their only serviceable wings off the bench are Tucker (if Donte is healthy) and Connaughton. A Brook Lopez trade could also be a good option to bring in multiple role players to fill out the bench, since Bobby Portis/Giannis at the 5 lineups proved successful in these playoffs."
"they are insanely valuable? lol. what is this comment  arguably a majority of teams have some sort of a ""volume shooter"" coming off the bench to be a focal point of the 2nd unit. Jordan Clarkson, Terrence Ross, Montrezl, Boucher, Melo, basically anybody who is taking about 10 shots a game while not starting. The teams that don't have one for the most part don't have successful or threatening second units."
"&gt; Is this a serious question...?   Yes, it is.  &gt;John Wall  He was not overpaid, he was one of the best PGs in the league when he signed that contract. The fact that he later got injured has nothing to do with the pay his agent got him during the last negotiations.  &gt;Ben Simmons  Ben is on a completely standard max extension for a player who is a number 1 pick, ROTY and All-Star. He would have gotten that exact same contract from any team, with any agent.   &gt;Lonzo Ball  You think so? Hollinger expected him to get a contract starting at $25 million a year, and he ended up on $18 million. Most reporters considered around $18 million to be the floor for Ball.   &gt;Eric Bledsoe  Really? What do you feel he's worth? He's on a two year contract, with only the first year fully guaranteed. He's making about half of what a max contract would be for his seniority. Seems about right where he should be.   &gt;Gary Trent jr  I reckon that's a bit early to say. If he keeps developing from how he played last year, he's a bargain on a contract that starts on $16 million. But he's a 22 year old kid coming off a rookie contract, so his career can obviously go in any direction still.   Overpaid, though? I bet a lot of teams would be happy to pay that for a 22 year old shooting almost 40% from 3PT, averaging 16 ppg.   &gt;KCP  Nah, man. His first contract with the Lakers was obviously an overpay, and entirely a bribe job for enticing LeBron to sign. However, his current contract is perfectly reasonable on the performance he's put up. Pretty average player making pretty average money, who signed an extension with a team that was salary capped and couldn't replace him if they let him go.  Anyway, like I said, Rich can get players paid when he can hold LeBron's weight over the head of the FO, which is exactly what happened in KCP's case.  &gt;Terrence Ross  Average player on an average contract. His base year salary was roughly 1.3 times the MLE, that's what he should be making.   &gt;Tristan Thompson  TT's current contract is at the MLE, which is where it should be. He's still a solid defensive player who can put up a few buckets on decent efficiency. That's what the MLE gets you.  His previous contract was an obvious overpay, but again, that's the LeBron effect, and the fact that the Cavs being capped out, they literally had no choice but to re-sign him.   &gt;JR Smith  Again, LeBron-cast signing. The Cavs have no choice but to sign him, as they can't replace him with the lack of cap space.   &gt;Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals.  It seems rather that your argument is that NBA salaries are too high, rather than these specific players being overpaid."
Terrence Ross
"Is this a serious question...?   John wall, Ben Simmons, Lonzo ball, Eric bledsoe, Gary Trent jr, KCP, Terrence Ross, Tristan Thompson, tht.  Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals."
"It's easy to be a draft savant when you have hindsight on your side.  I am looking at the drafts now in fact. Look at the top 5's:  2013: Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len   2014: Wiggins, Jabari, Embiid, Gordon, Dante Exum   2 out of 10 players ended up being great. If anything it makes the Cavs look better for trading while the guys still had high value.  The guys still available when they drafted Waiters were Thomas Robinson, Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, etc. So in all these scenarios there's one really great player that they missed (and 4-5 other teams passed on as well). If they took Giannis #1 in 2013 the GM would've been fired on the spot.   The Bennett pick is bad and one of the worst of all-time. But even that the likely alternative would've still been considered one of the biggest busts ever (unless they took Oladipo). I remember the hype leading up to the draft Alex Len was the most common projected #1. The other picks range from average to pretty good. They took TT over Jan Vesely, Biyombo, Knight, etc. Kyrie over Derrick Williams."
"Him asking for the “worst” player kinda throws superstar out the window tho. At that point it’s more about who’s the worst guy who’s role is to generate his own offense. Guys like Tj, Dinwiddie, Terrence Ross (big drop off) fit the bill"
Meanwhile the magic got Terrence Ross out of it
"For the Raptors, Kyle Lowry Game 6 vs the Celtics (2020) and Game 7 vs the Heat (2016), Terrence Ross 51 point game  For my favorite players: LeBron Game 6 vs the Celtics (2012), Devin Booker Game 1 vs the Lakers (2021), James Harden 60 point triple double"
Terrence Ross
"MCW is not the backup SF, he's like the 15th man. He probably doesn't play outside of garbage time.  It'll be probably be:   * Cole Anthony  * RJ Hampton  * Terrence Ross  * Franz Wagner  * Mo Bamba  Most of these bench units are missing key guys, possibly because you used ESPN. [This is a much more accurate source (although not perfect)](https://www.nbcsportsedge.com/basketball/nba/depth-charts).  In no order: Boston, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Washington probably are the top 5."
[Charania] The Orlando Magic have traded Terrence Ross to the Brooklyn Nets for Joe Harris. Kyrie Irving is looking forward to having Ross on the team.
wait..Terrence Ross said all this or the host?
"Talmbout Terrence Ross? Every bananas talmbout him. Great guy, never meddum."
this had got to be good for my Terrence Ross Top Shots
"When I first saw the headline I was like ""oh cool Terrence Ross is into reptiles! I know Danny Green loves snakes, that's a cool hobby"" and then the headline kept getting worse."
As a professional wildlife biologist I was excited Terrence Ross would be into herpetology but I guess this is the wrong kind of reptile I’m used to
Uhhhh... Terrence Ross for prime Dwight Howard? Yeah man
Terrence Ross had out before DeRozan then VanVleet beat it
"https://basketballforever.com/2020/03/26/the-most-unlikely-50-point-games-in-nba-history  Delk, Brewer, Jennings, terrence ross, andre miller, mo williams"
"I wouldn't consider Tyreke a one hit wonder. He averaged 20/5/5 as a rookie and never did it again, but had a ton of seasons around that number, closer to 17/5/5.  Jennings and his 55-point game is a great answer to this. Also in that same category of role players that randomly popped off for 50 once - Terrence Ross, Tony Delk, Corey Brewer. I remember Charlie Villanueva getting close to that once also."
"I have never been happier seeing three players leave then Patterson, carrol and fucking Ross. The first two couldn’t hit an open corner three for their lives and that was their only “strength” Terrence the chucker Ross will never be forgiven for how many shots he stole from Lowry and derozan."
what do you mean coaches aren’t making adjustments for role players? we need to double terrence ross ASAP
Even Terrence Ross has a 51 point game to his name lol
Terrence Ross
"Agree with you on the shooting and I don’t buy the argument that he just takes exceptionally difficult shots. Bball index calculates a shot quality metric that includes openness, whether or not a shot is self created, location on court, and being a movement shooter vs stationary one.   Despite not being in the top ten, Trae has a worse % than everyone on that list except for Terrence Ross. And outside of him and Luka who ranks first in most difficult 3s and shoots just .7% better than Trae, everyone else’s shot percentage is at least over 3% higher than Trae’s.   That being said, I think Trae’s playmaking is underrated if anything. Bball index also measures playmaking. Trae has 3 of the top 11 seasons in their 2013 to 2021 database. Like he hasn’t just been top 11 per season each of his 3 years in the league. His 3 seasons are all top 11 out of 9 years worth of players’ seasons. That’s insane. And him being an elite playmaker tallies with other metrics and also in my opinion the eye test."
"If it were up to me…  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don’t know where Gary Harris fits in, he’s a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don’t want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don’t want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
Edwards on Watanabe  J.R Smith on Gary Neal  Pippen on Ewing  Terrence Ross on Kenneth Faried (u all forgot)  Vince on Alonzo  Wade on Varejao  Pick one
Right beside Rudy Gay and Terrence Ross
Lorenzo Romar just forgot how to coach after Terrence Ross and Tony Wroten. They had a stretch for a while where they were really good
I’m surprised it wasn’t Terrence Ross for the sixers
"Nah, we don’t really. The most proven scorers on the team are Gary Harris and terrence Ross. Gary Harris 17.5 ppg in 17/18 is the highest average that a player on our roster accomplished. We have zero offensive firepower to be frank. The guys are young and some can dvelop into scorers over the years but this year will be very very ugly. We’d have to be an elite defensive unit to get to 30 wins, even then I think our offense will be so historically bad it’s not even possible."
Another one is when they show a Terrence Ross dunk and then turn him into an X wing lmao
"I saw Terrence Ross at a grocery (No Frills for the Torontonians) store in Toronto once. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw Terrence trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Coffee Crisps in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
Demarre Carrol  treats arena employees like fools and actively tries to dodge NBA rules that every single other nba player has no problem doing.   Terrence Ross - He drives while facetiming on his phone.   Jimmy Butler - He called me stupid but i also deserved it so idk.
Hey we had to give up a whole TERRENCE ROSS to get him.
"Yeah, but you guys got Oladipo and Sabonis, which turned in to Paul George, which turned in to SGA and a ton of picks. So OKC made out well.  Meanwhile Orlando went from Oladipo and Sabonis to Terrence Ross."
PatPat and Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross  Will Barton   Paul George
"Terrence Ross. Beal is a very selfish player who only seems to care about the score sheet, not the win. He is the opposite of a guy like Middleton"
"KCP got paid every year though.   Jordan Clarkson got paid.   Tristan got Paid. Gary Trent JR..Paid.  Terrence Ross, Dejounte Murray.  Marcus Morris had a great deal from the Spurs but Marcus turned it down.   Mikes Bridges, Darius Garland…all got paid well.    So where is this narrative that if you’re not a star e doesn’t get you paid?"
Terrence Ross has more self creation ability which is why he's more suited to the role.
Terrence Ross gonna go off to raise that trade value
"Seriously fuck Terrence Ross, dude has been a mid player his whole career but no matter what hits everything against the hornets"
"death, taxes and terrence ross"
How did terrence Ross end up in Orlando for so long? Surely a contender could've used him
A lot more players than just Kyrie are into some weird ass conspiracy stuff (see Terrence Ross).
RSHK Terrence Ross to you.
You’re preaching to the choir my friend. Fucken fourth quarter Terrence Ross
"**G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **G:** CJ McCollum  **F:** Tobias Harris   **F:** Serge Ibaka  **C:** Myles Turner  **Bench:** Lou Williams, Alec Burks, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic"
I think a better comparison is if Kuzma never played for the Lakers no one would ever talk about him. No one makes a post in r/nba when Terrence Ross likes a tweet
1 playoff win  trae young and terrence ross own your franchise
"[Terrence Ross on Kenneth Faried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiEFK7bDssE) is still my all-time fave.  Like, how did he dunk when at one point, he was like [this](https://imgur.com/a/0mqmONP) in the air?"
Terrence Ross = The Human Torch
Terrence Ross has the sexiest jump shot in the league.
This is Terrence Ross we’re talking about. Randomly going off is his specialty
"&gt; And I feel like 15 of those quarters have come against us and I hate it  FWIW every team says this about him. Like literally every team.  I'm sure if you searched comments on this sub containing the words 'Terrence Ross', the vast majority would also include 'why does he always go off against us??'."
Terrence Ross has some quarters where he will pull up mid sprint not even looking at the basket 6 times in a row and swish every one of them  And I feel like 15 of those quarters have come against us and I hate it
"Terrence Ross almost outscored the knicks in the 4th, yeesh"
Terrence Ross has to be one of the weirdest scorers of all time.
Terrence Ross.......................**FUCK YOU**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s official. I’m taking Terrence Ross over Michael Jordan.
and trade Terrence Ross this man doesn't care anymore
"Terrence Ross is low-key smooth. Dude glides like he weighs nothing, either on the floor or in the air."
Terrence Ross
Serge Ibaka for Terrence Ross plus the pick not being OG's pick.  Masai is Jesus
It doesn't help that their probably 2 best players in Robin Lopez and Terrence Ross are coming off the bench
" Jameer Nelson, Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkolu, Ryan Anderson, and Dwight Howard  vs  Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner, and Wendell Carter Jr  Not to mention, it’s SVG vs Jamahl Mosley, who is making his debut as a head coach.   The 2022 team is absolutely fucked"
"With vets like Terrence Ross, Robin Lopez, Gary Harris, Etwuan Moore and MCW it will be fun to watch their growth. Magic need to focus on adding shooting and wing help which is why if Adrian Griffin Jr is healthy he would be perfect for us at the 3 spot. Magic will have $28 million in capspace next yr and it will be fun to watch the growth of all these guys and see what we get for our vets during the trade deadline."
"jumping into defenders is one thing but players are way more skilled now from the perimeter. back in 2012 how many players could shoot 3s off the dribble or even do a step back 3? maybe KD, Melo, Curry, Kobe, lebron, pierce?  now you got non-star guys like tj warren, levert, terrence ross, mccollum, reggie jackson who can all create 3s"
"We aren't really focused on winning games as much as development this year, so I'd say Terrence Ross. His scoring and gravity off the ball opens up the floor for the rest of our young guys to play their games.   Even though he is one of the older players on the team, ironically I think he is actually the most important to achieving the goal of development, and there is a good argument for him leading the team in minutes.  Without TRoss on the floor we are an ugly mess taking contested twos and isoing because defenses are set and we don't have the personnel to shift defenders and make them scramble."
Terrence Ross
Yeah his defense has looked much improved this season. He shot 39% on catch and shoot threes last season so at the very least I think he’ll at least turn out to be a Terrence Ross type player
Terrence Ross against the Kings?? Game tying 3 pointer did not count because the shot clock did not start on time.   https://youtu.be/VCgrN5q3-3I
Fully expect them by deadline to move on from Terrence ross to get wagner more minutes. Isaac prob plays the 3/4 and carter at the 5 so bamba off the bench?
Lol bro facts. I really like Terrence Ross on the team but I know one of these days he’s gonna get traded… anyone decent in Orlando gets traded or leaves

Yeah scoring is everything!!! He should be traded for Terrence Ross!!
"The criteria in the draft is very few busts and a good number of players who over-achieve considering where they are drafted.  So for the Raptors these are their 1st round draft picks:  Scottie Barnes  Malachi Flynn  OG Anunoby  Jakob Poetl Pascal Siakam  Delon Wright  Bruno Caboclo (bust)  Terrence Ross  Jonas Valančiūnas  So 1 bust in 10 years. Pretty fucking good resume.  All of the players on this list are legit NBA rotation players, and a few have become borderline All Stars.   Pascal was selected 27th overall and is now a #1 option who scores +20-25 ppg, made an All Star Team and was All NBA.  OG was selected 23rd overall and is now one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and avgs +17 ppg and 40% from 3 point range.  And the list goes on.  And this is not including the undrafted talent (Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, REDACTED) that they have managed to find over the years."
"I'm not entirely sure if anyone of those 4 should be in conversation's with each other.  Luka is in conversation with Lillard and Harden. Trae is in somewhere along with Westbrook, Mitchell and Simmons. Morant is with guys like Caruso, L. Ball and Murray. And then Herro is with Mykhailiuk and Terrence Ross."
"Saw Willie Cauley Stein walking down the sidewalk with one other dude somewhere in Manhattan. Called him by his name and asked him for a picture. “yea sure man” he said. Wished him good luck with the Kings. It was 2016  Only few hours later, I met KAT at his greet and meet in a Foot Locker store for winning his ROY. Congratulated him for winning the ROY. “Oh, thanks!” He said with a big smile. Pictures not allowed, sadly. 2016 again    Saw Demar DeRozan and Ed Davis at Canada Wonderland’s when I was maybe 13. My friend suddenly blurted out “bro! Demar is over there!” Me not looking: “yeah right lol stop.” I looked over and there they are. 4-6 people following them. Demar ignored me. His girlfriend/or wife piggybacks his back for some reason. Ed Davis dapped me and said “what’s up man.” It looked like they are leaving. That’s it. Cool guy. Early 2010s   Saw Terrence Ross and Quincy Acy with my own eyes this time at Canada Wonderland’s another time. No one follows them this time (ahh, Canadians not caring about basketball) Quincy came off kinda egotistical but I actually find it hilarious. He didn’t look annoyed or irritated. It’s just Quincy thinks he’s the shit. Terrence was very polite and took a picture with me and thanked me for saying hello. Early 2010s again    I notice calling them by their names first helped."
his ceiling is really like terrence ross JJ Reddick type tho. not someone who can help a team a lot in the future on their own

"Terrence ""Betsy"" Ross"
Dare i say Terrence Ross?
I love Terrence Ross. That’s all
"magic starters: jalen suggs, gary harris, terrence ross, franz wagner, wendell carter jr"
"I think that Enes Kanter would win, he has the right disposition to win in my mind.   Who would be the two goofy guys that die first in the 'Red Light, Green Light' game? I could see it being Javale McGee and Terrence Ross."
Terrence Ross was God among men in the old 2K’s. I still remember him being a lot of trouble in 2K16 as well.
Terrence Ross
"Here’s the thing: Not every play that looks the similar are actually the same.   This video at 2:10 is what a defender running into a shooter looks like: https://youtu.be/eh9J9tQlrXw  Here Curry is already in shooting motion when the defender is still recovering. The close out is way too hard and they end up running into Steph who’s already shooting the ball. The recovery was reckless and he was punished accordingly.   However, for Terrence Ross, he has already recovered for a whole second before Trae even shoots the ball. Ross lost Trae but made a great recovery that wasnt too hard but good enough to prevent a shot. Ross isnt recovering while Trae is already in shooting motion. Trae only starts going up one whole second after Ross has recovered.   The first one: Defensive player makes a bad defensive move that interferes the offensive player’s shooting motion.   The second one: Offensive player deliberately forces contact on defender that interferes with his own shot.   In one the defender is clearly in the wrong, in the other, the offensive is basically setting the defender up for something they didnt do."
Again if you really had any balls you would come back here and explain where Fournier fouled Trae. You also aren’t man enough to explain the T.Ross play.  Tell me: Why is Terrence Ross penalized for jogging beside Trae? Go ahead and shoot.
"Lmao if you think im a kid jokes on you. I’ve been in competition and clubs all my life. Even got a game in a few hours. My whole purpose for my team is to be the best defender and playmaker i can be. I know more about basketball that you can ever dream of, *kid*.   If that wasnt good enough for you check the next few clips and look at Terrence Ross’ one. You gonna penalize a man for jogging beside you? Lmao you a pathetic man. Calling others a kid when you dont even know who they are.   Let me ask you: Have you ever played organized basketball? Or do you only watch in on your TV and think you know everything? Pathetic"
"Terrence Ross.   I thought he would have been an allstar by now. He scored 51 one night and next day he scores like 4 points -.- but when he got traded for Ibaka to Orlando I swear he was gonna be the next TMac. 6'7 athletic as fuck, dunks so gracefully, he just needs to be consistent."
"2011- Jonas Valančiūnas to Jan Vesely   2012- Terrence Ross to Andre Drummond  2013- N/A  2014- Bruno Caboclo to Mitch McGary  2015- Delon Wright to Justin Anderson   Pretty rough.   All three were traded for important championship pieces. Caboclo was 2 years away from being 2 years away 2 years ago, but Mitch McGary was worse"

Terrence Ross only scored more than 20 4 times before going off for 51.
"&gt; Orlando traded Victor Oladipo, Ersan llyasova and Domantas Sabonis to get ~~him~~ Terrence Ross and Anžejs Pasečņiks."
Oh my goodness was Terrence Ross all you got back for him??

Terrence Ross has been pretty decent for a long time.
"shiiiiiit, I've got a team full of those dudes already.  I'd rather the Wiz trade for like Terrence Ross, Thad Young, Eric Gordon or fucking TJ Warren at the deadline than send him to Portland for a partially washed Robert Covington."
Plz trade us Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross?
"Gary Harris/Terrence Ross toss up right now lol.  Mo Bamba at 3rd   Solely based on on-the-court performance really, and TRoss has been playing better (by this years standards). Gary has looked awful in every game except for 1 fourth quarter"
Terrence Ross?
Terrence Ross
"What I’d do is go through teams that are trash and see if there are any players of value starting with the magic, Detroit, rockets, pelicans, spurs, kings, and thunder.   I’m sure these tanking teams want a high upside player for someone who’s probably riding their bench or affecting their tanking. Just one name off the top of my head is Terrence Ross"
"Siakam didn't develop until Casey was gone. Casey himself said that Siakam was like Bruce Brown for him. Would come in and guard and would never shoot unless it was the last option.  The time Siakam spent w Casey he was a rebounder and didn't even bring the ball up the floor and we didn't see anything that made him a menace in transition.  Casey can be credited for: developing DeRozan, JV, Norman Powell, Terrence Ross, and a few select others.  When Nurse got here we saw the development of OG, Siakam, and others.  With that said, credit for these guys should go to the 905 and not Casey."
"Because someone on the top 75 in their supposed prime failing to lead or carry a team is noteworthy. Did you forget about all the shit Melo got for failing to lead the Knicks anywhere? This is pretty typical of a superstar status player: you get paid the big bucks to be that big name. Let’s not act like there isn’t a cost to anything. The dude is making outrageous money and this is the cost of that, he’s gonna get singled out.  We obviously don’t give a fuck if Terrence Ross or Tyler Zeller or fucking Cory Joseph have a bad game or something. That’s not news. A guy who is paid to BE THAT GUY and failing constantly is a discussion point.  “Guess what? Cory Joseph only got 1 assist the other night, what does this mean for his legacy?” doesn’t hold any weight, come on."
"Westbrook is pretty much stuck there and they don’t have any good firsts they can trade. You’re swapping old vets for other old vets. That’s going to be a downgrade with them having to now integrate into the system themselves. Ofc there is hope they can trade THT, an expiring contract, and that 2027 first for maybe a role player like Terrence Ross. If they are lucky they can get a guy like Myles Turner or Harrison Barnes/Hield but let’s be honest. If the Pacers/Kings call more than 3 teams they are getting a better offer than that."
"Nah, I’ve watched him since day one. He has cold stretches but I wouldn’t say that’s inconsistent. He isn’t like Terrence Ross or Jeff Green or Andrew Wiggins who look like prime MJ one day and then look like a fan stumbled out on the court the next."
"Outside of the big 3, the only role players that would have any value on the trade market are THT, and *maybe* Malik Monk.  They would have to target older role players on bad teams out of playoff contention looking to sell. So maybe THT for Terrence Ross?  Or Daniel House + Nwaba from Houston to improve their defence? Josh Hart from the Pelicans?  I’m curious how Laker fans still value THT. I think his trade value was a lot higher one or two seasons ago."
"someone on the Rockets is bound to have a career game against us lmao, don't count yourselves out yet    If you wondering who went off on us during our losses, it was OG/GTJ against Toronto, Terrence Ross on fire TWICE against Orlando as basically Curry-lite, Myles Turner having a career night from 3 with the Pacers, Rubio scoring a career high 37 points on us on 8/9 shooting from 3 and Mobley scoring a career high 26 points, &amp; Pat Connaughton with a near career high of 23 points  Imma bet either Jalen Green or Sengun (if he gets a lot of minutes) will go off on us especially with KPJ out"
Trent is utter trash outside of shooting the basketball. He reminds me a lot of Terrence Ross when he was a Raptor. Heat check guy that does little else. He might get 50 one night though!
"i stopped watching at the terrence ross fts, no point"
Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross
Terrence Ross is the president. Before this season that dude would seemingly drop 40 on us every time.
"Kawhi's career high is 45, Corey Brewer 51  You can also add like Terrence Ross"

"League average TS% is 55% btw.  I think I said ""you can argue for that triple double game to be a good game""  And taking 5 game averages is dumb af. Terrence Ross averaged 20ppg across 5 games in 2013-2014. (51,10,12,18,8) Ended the season with 10ppg"
Right and taking 5 game samples is dumb af.  Terrence Ross averaged 19.8 ppg across 5 games in 2013-2014 season.
"Yeah and its stupid as fuck.  Terrence Ross scored 51, 10, 12, 18, 8 in 2013-2014 season.  He was averaging 19.8 points."
Terrence ross
Terrence Ross is building a house man sheesh
Terrence Ross especially
"&gt;Saying Ross never ""broke out"" is nonsense. He's not a superstar no, but he's become a dangerous scoring 6th man with the ability to save or win you a quarter (or more of basketball).   Right and people were hoping he'd become an allstar earlier in his career...he never hit that mark because of his inconsistency.   So yeah, potentially being a decent 6th man is him not breaking out. That's an incrediblely fair assessment.   It's always been ""he could do this"" and ""he could be that"", long before his time in Orlando.  [What you're saying about watching more of his game is fair, but you have to understand there are other fanbases who were saying the exact same thing 7 years ago.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1937407-is-terrence-ross-or-demar-derozan-a-better-building-block-for-toronto-raptors) I'm not trying to discount what you've seen with your own eyes, but what you've seen has to be put into context.  You're talking about an exciting player with potential without seemingly realising that potential was always around and never turned into anything.   Now after a decade of stagnation he's a 30 year old who still doesn't have the consistency to warrant a large trade price.  30 year old coulda-beens aren't nearly as valuable as what you seem to think.   ""Maybe he just needs a new environment"" isn't something GMs say about 30 year old players.   &gt;with the ability to save or win you a quarter (or more of basketball).   Right and he's also been a guy who's shot you out of games as well.   Which is why his overall percentages are disappointing despite his league-renoun hot stretches (of which, our team was a frequent victim)."
"Ross is a better player than Fournier. Ross has singlehandedly willed us to many many victories over the year, Fournier has not. Terrence Ross is quite literally a one man offense. He would immediately impact any team with offensive troubles, especially with their bench unit. It's really easy to look at raw stats but T Ross's 15 ppg is very very very different from Fournier's 17 ppg, which is what he's averaged for the last 6 years. 20ppg is not Fournier's floor.   That's just my 2 cents, stats don't really explain what Ross brings to a team. He would bring even more if he was on a halfway decent team. He gets shut down now because teams know how impactful he is so they gameplan to shut him down and we have no one else that can score like him. Next to Brown and/or Tatum, it would be much harder for teams to shut him down."
Terrence Ross just… really does not like us.
"**Best:**  - Sweet Franz making our whole sub look stupid.  - WCJ becoming our most reliable player.   - Cole Anthony showing glimpses of superstardom.  - Being a fun team with loads of potential.  **Worst:**  - Suggs being awful.  - Terrence Ross forgetting how to shoot.  - Being very young and experienced, and consequently getting blown out of the building every other game."
"Yeah a Terrence Ross type of dude feels more like him. It's not that he doesn't pass, a lot of it feels like he just can't see the right pass or he only passes when his first 3 dribble moves don't work, then the offense resets all over again."

I thought Terrence Ross would be a Multi-time all-star with the raptors after he scored 51
Terrence Ross for Westbrick pls
Terrence Ross hasn't been good for a long time now
Terrence Ross.   Get this man to a playoff team that needs shooting.
"&gt; Bias  no it isn’t, Terrence Ross sucks and is even more inefficient than Coby was in a much bigger role (not to mention a completely new role with a new coach and a shortened covid offseason) as a 20 year old sophomore.  Yes he has proven himself to be a good shot creator lol have you even watched him in your life? Sure he was inefficient, but he showed insane flashes of shot creation and he has an extremely deep bag of scoring moves.  Absolutely zero chance we can get Grant and close to zero chance we get Barnes, so that point is moot."
Terrence Ross did this against Atlanta once many years ago
"At the beginning of the season we were trying to do that somewhat, making 3-4 subs at a time in an effort to keep the starting group together, but after giving up several 18-0 runs the moment the bench came in we have since moved to trying to keep one of Cole/Suggs and one of Bamba/WCJ on the floor at all times.  It's mostly Terrence Ross and Gary Harris have been totally checked out. TRoss has never been a great defender, but he's barely shooting the ball now as well and constantly turning it over. Gary was supposed to be great defense some offense and he's been horrifically negative on both ends. The other team is pretty much guaranteed to go on a run when Harris comes in the game - this was Gary's best game of the season and he was still -4 in a game we won by 7. At their current pace, TRoss and Harris will break the record for worst total plus minus in a season."
This is why people don't trust guys putting numbers up on bad teams. Terrence Ross and Corey Brewer had 50pt games before lol
Markelle Faultz and Terrence Ross to Lakers   Westbrook to Magic
If Lakers had assets Gary Harris and Terrence Ross could be the way out but I doubt ORL is selling low on Ross for THT and some low value draft picks
"Terrence Ross, Derozan, Desmond Bane, Herro.  Bench gunners and lean forwards that can create their own shot and for others are perfect 3rd bananas IMO historically guys like Love, Bosh, Draymond, FVV, Ginobili etc"
"Lakers should sign James Ennis  Try to trade for Buddy Hield or Terrence Ross  Start AD at the 5, LBJ at the 4, Ennis at the 3, Ross/Hield at the 2, RW at the 1"
"Mo Wagner, Gary Harris, and Terrence Ross shouldn’t be locked in for Orlando"
"Can I interest you in one (1) Terrence ""The Human Torch"" Ross?  Available for the low low price of Richardson + Nesmith + a 1st"
Then Terrence Ross &amp; Corey Brewer must be all time greats right and better than kawhi?  Idiot.  You clearly don’t know what you’re talking about dude.
Do y’all want one Terrence Ross
"They have a similar slim frame, but Green is taller, and their style right now are quite different. Green currently plays more like Terrence Ross who settles for difficult outside shots, while Payne is more drive and finishing inside oriented."
"They also have Terrence Ross, who they want to play because they want to trade at the deadline."
"we need to destroy the Magic by 20+ in a few weeks, don't give them any life from the jump (and don't ever let Terrence Ross touch or shoot the ball either)"
"Terrence Ross, I thought he was going to be an all star."
"If contracts matched, Westbrook and Terrence Ross would be seen as equal value. Especially in the playoffs"
"absolutely wild to me that a guy like derozan, who was touted as the next kobe as a prospect and played SG basically his entire career next to guys like rudy gay and terrence ross, is now playing the 4 consistently"
Damn you guys and Terrence Ross' mystical Knick-Killing powers!!!!     I swear that man whispers 'SHAZAM' every time he's about go against the Knicks.
