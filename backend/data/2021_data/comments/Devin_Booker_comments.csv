"You don't need support to be good individually, KAT has been great individually because he is actually good, and so was Devin Booker and many others who are labled ""empty stats players""  Actually in a bad team you get more of an opportunity to shine, no team in the NBA would allow Edwards to take 15 shots shooting like he has so it's not the teams fault   But he's still young so there is that"
Difference is you also have to deal with Devin Booker.
Devin Booker and I could just play Warzone all day. Dude is pretty great at Warzone.
They had herro apparently the next Devin booker
Devin Booker from deep!
This is tough.  Do I watch Devin Booker or Oprah?
Watching this State Farm commercial just dawned on me... cp3 in the commercial with a black devin booker
Some people think Devin Booker is injured but really he just got ejected during warmups
Devin Booker had 28 without the Mountain Dew balls. I think that was the previous record
"[OptaBall] 31 - Stephen Curry has beaten Devin Booker, and Mike Conley (tonight) for the most points ever in a round of the NBA 3 point shootout with 31. Shootout."
 Conley just tied devin booker record
[OptaBall] 28 - Mike Conley has tied Devin Booker for the most points ever in a round of the NBA 3 point shootout. Sniper.
"So would you say Donovan Mitchell has top 10 player potential since he’s leading the Jazz to the best record in the league? What about Devin Booker? Personally I think Beal is and will continue to be better than both of them, but your logic would place them ahead of him in terms of ceiling, correct? Is Paul George a top 10 player? No way he leads a team as the number one option.   I agree he probably isn’t capable of being the guy on a championship team (although look at who he’s played with throughout his career...he hasn’t benefited from playing with all around great teams like others have), but I still think you can be a top 10 player and not be capable of being that guy. Melo was top 10 for years and never good enough to be that guy. Neither was Chris Paul. I’m cherry picking players but you get my point."
"[since you can't hear, hopefully you can read] (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30994442/phoenix-suns-get-character-win-lakers-devin-booker-ejection)  &gt; ""Booker received his first technical foul for continuous complaining and then he received his second technical foul, and as per rule was ejected, for directing profane language at a game official,"" crew chief Marc Davis told ESPN as part of a pool report after the game."
r/nba made it seem like the Lakers were reacting to Devin Booker calling the ref a bitch I fucking hate y’all lol
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~
"U can’t call Booker, Devin. Makes him uncomfortable"
"we have a couple bigger things going that are like the episode that dropped today -- i love the smaller things (the devin booker double technical???), the things i find bizarre (why has lebron taken so many technical FTs for his teams over his career when he's literally bad at them?) and asking how basketball informs the world and vis versa"
Suns. Devin Booker.
Continue to enforce the rules on everyone. That includes Lebrun Luka and Devin Booker the biggest complainers in the game.
"I’d take Devin Booker over Jamal Murray, does that make things ok between us?"
"Are you forgetting that Draymond went on live television during the bubble run and openly tampered with Devin Booker, saying ""Get my man OUTTA Phoenix?""  Or forgetting the times Draymond slandered the Suns organization to defend Marquese Chriss playing major minutes for a team that went 15-50?  Or how about the time Steve Kerr let the players coach in a blowout vs. the Suns?    And if you're talking success after a long drought and being cocky af, how about the 2015 Warriors winning a championship due to injuries to 2 of the 3 best players on the cavs and immediately talking shit?"
Those are the rules. Act up get Td up. Slows down the game but keeps all the players in check. Harrell has no business screaming during play just like the whole Jazz team had no business trying to do the refs job. Just like Devin Booker has no business shouting obscenities and officials trying to do one of the hardest jobs ever.
and people think he's as good as devin booker lol
"In fact he said ""thats a foul f\*ggot"" right after the ""Technical foul Devin Booker"""
Devin Booker would never.
He's basically the opposite of Devin Booker against the sixers
"""By golly young man watch your language""  -Steve Rogers to Devin Booker"
"Devin Booker, and now Donovan Mitchell getting ejected as a result of officials being ass"
Another proof it's Devin Booker AND Donovan Mitchell
those Devin Booker comparisons are making more sense now
[Devin Booker to the ref last night.](https://youtu.be/yQpKhpvTszQ)
He's gonna go down as the best to never win a championship until he joined a team with Devin Booker.
"they are doing good no doubt, but in fairness, they inherited their best player, Devin Booker"
"I’m super late but I hear:  “That ain’t no damn foul”  “Technical foul, Devin Booker”  Either “Where’s the foul, bitch” or “That ain’t a foul, bitch”  Everybody gasps and he gets tossed"
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
"When Dame hit his big series-ending shot against the Rockets, it was his second year in the league and he was only six months younger than Devin Booker is right now."
Devin Booker got a bad case of ejectile dysfunction the other night
" [Devin Booker EJECTED From Game - Suns vs Lakers | March 2, 2020-21 NBA Season - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBxVGVvbGVI&amp;ab_channel=HouseofHighlights)      There are clearly 3 refs in that game."
devin booker is one of the hottest heads in the league lmao it's nothing new
PUT ME IN SPACE JAM 2 YOU COWARDS -Devin Booker
"I don’t personally give two shits about the refs or their feelings. They get paid incredible wages to travel the country and work out for two hours while getting the power trip of holding millionaire athletes accountable.   The NBA should dramatically reduce their ability to throw players out at a refs’ personal discretion, in my opinion. I don’t care if they straight up threaten your family, I paid to see / watch Devin Booker. As long as they don’t touch you, words really aren’t enough for me."
I’m sure that Devin Booker and Draymond Green aren’t losing sleep over 15k
Devin booker easily bc if you look at his 70 point game he didn’t even make tht much 3s
"[You're gone, Devin Booker! You said S my C!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAHptwgWPCc)"
"The refs did the viewers a favor..  if Devin Booker was still in, then the final score would have been 150-97 Phoenix.  The refs made the game more interesting!"
"""water is wet"" - devin booker"
"""Hey man, I think it's kind of weird to dip your ribeye steak in mustard but you do you boo."" - *Devin Booker moments before getting ejected*"
“ where’s my foul bitch” - Devin booker
"I was confused the whole night, not only cuz of the bad reffing but the announcers on tnt were constantly reporting the wrong calls. I remember the lakers turned the ball over and they said it was a kick ball? I was like huh?? How, when the ball was deflected off THT's foot. Then the Devin Booker incident when they ejected him basically off screen, they didn't even show him getting his first tech and all of a sudden he was gone."
"What the hell did Devin Booker say that every Laker on the court would look shocked and Jae Crowder would try to claim ""I said that"". Players only say that when they're 100% certain its gonna get their teammate tossed"
Devin Booker said to the ref “where’s my foul bitch?”
"“SUCK MY COCK, ILL MURDER YOUR FAMILY” -Devin Booker"
"They should let Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zack LaVine and Jaylen Brown do all of the dunk contest, 3p contest and skills challenge. /r/nba will go wilding"
"I dunno if its only me but I can clearly hear the following:  Referee: ""Technical foul Devin Booker"" (First technical)  DB: ""That's a foul? F\*gg\*t""  And thats when you see the reactions and the other referee comes out and gives him the 2nd technical (in the other replays you can see which one tossed him)."
"**""LeBron's beard is subpar."" - Devin Booker**   Wars have been started for less."
"My conclusion is that Devin Booker said, “you love sucking lebrons dick all day”"
"I didnt say there isn’t fouls or say hockey or nfl doesnt havent penalties, fouls are extremely common in the nba and no calls are just as bad. its the hardest sport to officiate”correctly” especially flopping going on just adds another layer..the contact fouls and illegal screens that happen every play on both ends. The refs decide what a foul is not the rule..so you could argue being a ref in the nba is easiest because u can call what you want and it want matter good or bad and not look like a bad ref because they all do it. With the devin booker situation all players talk to the refs now they get to decide the threshold because ur not suppose to argue or touch the refs. Some get away with it some dont..the nba would b the easiest game to rig snd its my favorite sport."
“Is Devin Booker the worst fake all star ever?”
"&gt;""the fuck out you had to kill kobe to be king of LA""  No way, Devin Booker said this?"
"From the ref report:   **QUESTION:**  **Why was Devin Booker ejected?**  **DAVIS:** “Booker received his first technical foul for continuous complaining and then he received his second technical foul, and as per rule was ejected, for directing profane language at a game official.”  **QUESTION: Why did Justin Van Duyne assess a second technical foul after Tyler Ford called the first one and was already walking away from the play?**  **DAVIS:** “For directing profane language at a game official.”  I still want to know what he said though :)"
"Phoenix Suns Devin Booker fined $100,000 by the NBA on Wednesday for a gay slur that commissioner Adam Silver called “offensive and inexcusable”    ...is what I’m speculating."
[MFW Devin Booker says “that ain’t no damn foul!”](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/cnu2RrM) 😰😰
Devin Booker just said “Demarcus Cousins” and he got T’d and ejected.
"they stopped that THUG Devin Booker from showing up the refs and DISRESPECTING THE GAME like he owns... /s  I think the refs might actually be worshipping the old school ""respect the game"" narrative."
"Devin Booker specifically   Not shit talking in general  Reasonable amount is fine, personally feel like he does it more than others and with less reason / pedigree   To each their own"
"The reactions of all the players would indicate that he did indeed say something at the same time. LeBron isn’t going “Oh shit wtf wtf” because of Devin Booker bouncing the ball. And the fact him and Crowder didn’t protest his ejection would also seem to indicate that, him and his teammates aren’t just taking it calmly like that if he’s getting ejected for bouncing the ball.  Edit: The pool report for referees just came out and said the second tech was for profane language."
"I honestly dont give a shit about the suns n never will LOL. but devin booker is amaZing, undeniable talent. Luka is just far better than him, in every aspect."
Devin Booker should be able to fine the NBA for this nonsense...
"I try to have a wholesome night watching basketball with my kids and they’re subjected to THAT disgusting crap?   My 5-year-old daughter, through tears, asked me “Daddy, why doesn’t Devin Booker respect the unilateral authority of the officials?”   What am I supposed to tell her?"
Devin Booker: Exist   Referees: GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE
"It's was never Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell, it's Devin Booker AND Donovan Mitchell"
"""The Phoenix Suns waive Devin Booker and Adam Silver bans him from signing any new contracts in the league."""

🎶 It was Devin Booker all along 🎶
Oh yeah I forgot how unclutch Chris Paul and Devin Booker are
this does bring a smile to my face -devin booker hater
I just really wanna know what devin booker said to the ref lmao
"Cmon bro, I know he’s on your team so you gotta defend him but the list of YouTube videos of devin booker getting into with other players is long as shit. He’s gets into it, way more often than other players"
Devin Booker: tries to play basketball  Referees: FUCK OUTA HERE I GOT IT
Devin Booker is a decoy for Dario Saric like Keira Knightley in Phantom Menace
I’m usually against calling players douches but devin booker definitely has a long history of being a hothead . He’s always getting into shit lol
I use to work at cox communications ( Major ISP) they have a monopoly on the internet. He calls in and I so happen to answer. He was having some issue on his internet. He gave me his name and address to pull his account up. I looked the address up and it was like a 6 million dollar home in Phoenix. I go “yo you Devin Booker on the suns?” He says “ya” I go “dope”. I helped him and just told him I like his game.
I spoke with Devin Booker on the phone one time. Was really nice.
Devin Booker who has the single-round record and won in 2018?
"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=devin+booker+fight  look at the list of fights and ejections he has had, he is a known doucebag  and he called the ref a bitch or pussy if you watch the replay   not fucked up , he is just unlikeable"
JJ Redick  🤝 Devin Booker  Getting ejected for passing the ball to a ref
Devin Booker is a douche
Literally just talking about how NBA refs are the worst in all of aports and this shit happens. What the actual fuck? Devin bounced a ball at a ref and the other ref had to go and save him from mean Mr. Booker?
"Refs saw that Devin Booker was getting more attention than them, had to take care of that."
"these refs are lame as fuck. IDGAF IF DEVIN BOOKER CALLS YOUR MOM A WHOOR, HE KEEPS PLAYING BASKETBALL"

Devin Booker: *gets hacked and yells in agony*  [Refs:](https://streamable.com/3wdg0c)
Devin booker should be in the MVP conversation
Maybe like a Devin Booker/Kyrie Irving?
"I like Devin Booker less than Jaylen, so the stat is garbage and doesn't mean anything. However, I like him more than PG, so if the stats say he's a better defender than PG, so be it.   How'd I do?"
"no it's a great stat, i agree that devin booker is a better defender than PG and jaylen brown. numbers don't lie."
"What? Ray Allen was not a plus defender lmao he had 4 straight garbage defensive seasons priror to 08 (devin booker bad) you’re also overrating PPs defense he also was a - Dbpm the 2 seasons prior to 08. Eye test tells you KGs Versatility absolutely elevated that D &amp; made them look better. The stats tell you the same thing, it’s night &amp; day"
wouldn’t call devin booker a guarantee yet.
"Move over Devin Booker, there’s a new poster boy for the good “despite the loss” games"
I don't see these kinds of excuses that isn't from their own team's fan for Trae Young and Devin Booker when they were on terrible teams
"In several years, we'll look back and say Kobe Bryant and Devin Booker"
"Travis Scott has a song, and in that song is a lyric that goes ‘Wet like I’m Book.’ Thats referring to Suns guard Devin Booker. That’s pretty much it for now."
"From up to 15-17 feet and from that side angle it's an extremely easy and reproduceable shot. Obviously it's still possible to bank shots in from farther than that and from other angles but it becomes much harder/less consistent.  As for why more players don't use it's cause for mid to long 2s and considering the caliber of shooters NBA players are it's already easy enough to just swish it consistently without the backboard, and the bank is also only open from certain angles and distances. From closer ranges like 7 to 15 feet most elite scoring guards and wings like Devin Booker or Klay Thompson etc know how to use the backboard for buckets whether 2 handed or 1 handed scoop, turnarounds, fades, don't matter. They just don't use glass for the deeper 15-23 foot midrange jumpers like Westbrook or Duncan cause they don't need to a regular jumper is still like a layup from that range.  There's also another type of shot that you don't see a lot in the NBA which is like driving the same angle as a layup and using the same footwork and technique but just releasing the ball from farther away from the basket like a hook or one legged runner. Probably cause the nba is full of crazy tall, crazy long, guys who are crazy fast and bouncy and would volleyball those shots into the stands. But you see it in youth basketball my old teammate was a pg who was good at it and Xavier Simpson at Michigan was a master at that shot."
"Any chance that Ja Morant gets a nod as a wildcard? If there's an emphasis on winning teams then let me remind you that the Grizzlies are the fourth seed right now.  Ja Morant: 20.7/2.1/7.7 on .539/.300/.806 (2.9 3PA). The rebounding and 3-point percentage is suspect, but for a guard he's scoring very efficiently from the field.   If the guards are locked up between Dame, Steph, Luka and Donovan Mitchell then I could see someone trying to make an argument for Ja over someone like Devin Booker for a wildcard. Also for what it's worth, SGA and DeAaron Fox are playing pretty hot right now and are putting up statlines similar to Booker but they're both on losing teams.  For what it's worth, I just don't see either Mike Conley or CP3 making it this year. Not at 16 PPG."
"I mean you can say that, but was their roster even good at any point to expect consistent wins?  What is the difference between 'we're tanking' and just having a shitty team?  With a healthy blake for half a season they were looking pretty decent and got some wins and a playoff appearance, and there was one year where they made the eastern conference finals.. but can you really blame them losing all those years on Drummond?  It's like blaming Devin Booker for the suns losing up until this point."
Imagine not having Chris Paul and Devin Booker on your team
"PG: Luka, Ja, Trae, De'Aaron Fox, a future player.  SG: Jaylen Brown. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Future player  SF: Jayson Tatum, De'Andre Hunter, Keldon Johnson, 2 future players  PF: Giannis, AD, Sabonis, John Collins, Kristaps Porzingis  C: Jokic, Embiid, Bam Adebayo, James Wiseman, a future player"

Devin Booker is to the Dallas Mavericks as Paul Goldschmidt was to the San Francisco Giants and Liverpool (A) are to Arsenal
DEVIN ARMANI BOOKER
There aren't many players in these past few years that have made me lose my will to live (in as much as sports can cause) as Devin Booker. Feel like we never beat this team and that's largely cause he's always there for a clutch bucket.
I love Devin Booker man

Devin Booker is half black half mexican &amp; puerto rican too just like JTA (half black half mexican) but i think they're the only two currently
No Devin Booker was playing out of his mind is why they went 8-0
"The Suns with Devin Booker, for starters."
"But what about fit in 2018? Y’all are thinking about fit in 2021, but consider the 2018 Suns roster. No CP3 lol. I mean like 90% of that roster ended up getting moved and the only sure thing was Devin Booker. When you’re clearly rebuilding, why not draft for talent?"
"An answer to your question would be 24 year old Monta Ellis.   But you've combined two different statements from two different paragraphs.   I said that there's been 25ppg scorers who should be playing in lesser roles if they were on a contender. Maybe as 2nd or 3rd options.   Then I said there has been players who have put up good numbers but would have been 6th men.   Take 21 year old Devin Booker (not the current, more developed, Devin Booker). He averaged 24.9ppg on 56% TS. He was a turnstile on defense. He lead the worst offense in the NBA.    He would have been a 3rd/4th option on a contender. But if you're 3rd/4th option is a bad defender then what are they adding? You're probably better with them being the first option on the second unit."
sounds like devin booker 2 years ago
No devin booker?
"Oh, the soccer community here knows it. Hockey is alittle different where they’re kind of a decent mix of high schools, travel teams, and pro youth development systems.

damn really I thought Devin Booker would have done it during that season when he scored 70 pts
"""I'm done with not making the playoffs. I'm serious,” Booker said Wednesday as the Suns conducted their exit interviews following a 21-61 season. “This is probably the last year I'm ever not making the playoffs."" - Devin Booker from the 2017 - 2018 season. Let's hope the 3rd year's the charm!"
Looking at the starting roster/ depth chart why the fuck isn’t Devin Booker listed as a starter?
Wtf? Why wasn’t Devin Booker in the staring line up
"I’ve always been a Devin Booker fan, and I hate when people say empty stats, but I feel like wins have to have SOME impact on all star status. If you’re scoring 40+ and losing the last 10 games where you’ve done it, I feel like there’s little excuse there. I feel like when you have another player like Russ who’s definitely not good this year, but he’s an option and you still can’t win a game, you don’t deserve an all star starter for that. Trae was really the only offense on the hawks last season so I understand it to a degree but I don’t think Beal deserves an all star start, and tbh he shouldn’t be an all star"
But Devin Booker hasn’t played for 3 games and several of their games also were canceled due to COVID-19.
"Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Kevin Garnett"
Devin Booker amirite? A hoe said he has a 14 incher erect
7 players with double-digit points on a night missing their star. I used to just love Devin Booker. But now I love the Suns.
Well Devin Booker scored 0 points!
[He did. I'm not making this up.](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/08/09/draymond-green-fined-devin-booker)  And yeah I'm bitter about it.
"Oubre felt bad that Devin Booker was out and decided to be the 6th guy on the court for the Suns.  Seriously, Oubre thinks he is KD with the green light he gets. He isn't a better shooter than Wiggins, Paschall, Lee."
"There was a considerable amount of time when Damian Lillard wasn't considered good enough to be an all-star. Now Devin Booker is experiencing the same thing.  Conley has never been anything close to a bonafide snub. I think you'd be hard pressed to even argue he deserved it any given year without making a detailed response about how a much more talented player missed an odd amount of games and his team was doing worse at All-Star break, which kind of misses the point of the game."
"Are people voting for Devin Booker just cause,because he definitely has not been playing at an all star level. There are far better choices like Conley"
"He's weird, the flashes are there but he just isnt assertive frequently enough. The stats on the surface look ok but he's just high variance game to game he has like 4 games with at least 24 points and like 5 or 6 in single digits.   Still doesnt have that much of a 1 v1 game just dependent on fadeaway jumpers and cant really pass. Gotten a little better with it this year but he should still get to the free throw line more than he does for someone with his tools. It's weird, outside of putbacks the only way he can really do anything on offense is when Chris Paul passes him the ball. There's just no chemistry with anybody else like Jae Crowder has thrown him more passes this year than Devin Booker."
Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker
"It's also arguably a detriment to the east in the long term, despite it making it easier to make the playoffs  In the west you can be a really good team and miss the playoffs, therefore keeping you in the lottery and picking higher than a much worse team (or teams) that makes the playoffs in the other conference  There have been multiple instances of this resulting in good teams drafting better players than their much worse opponents in the other conference. The Suns got TJ Warren and Devin Booker, the Nuggets got Donovan Mitchell (and then traded) and Michael Porter Jr, the Lakers ended up moving up for 4th in 2020. These teams are able to accumulate talent and win while keeping their pick higher  Meanwhile, teams like the Magic, haven't really won much at all, don't have a great roster, and their players 2nd contracts are ending or have ended. Yet, they still haven't had a high lottery pick since like 2017  Not to mention that by making it easier to make the playoffs with poorer rosters, it makes it more likely that ownership or management will settle or retain rosters that in the long term won't ever get out of the dreaded middle  All of this is likely why it has taken so long for the east to finally catch back up to the west, but even then the west is still deeper likely in part due to this higher level of play needed to compete."

"Christian Wood but he might actually still be underrated.      He's scoring more PPG than Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker and KAT.      He's rebounding more per game than Adams, AD, Lebron, Luka and Russ.      He's blocking more shots per game than Embiid, Lopez and Giannis"

Cmon dude we have Devin Booker
"Devin Booker possibly, or does Chris Paul negate that?"
I like Donovan but Devin Booker drives me crazy. What a player.
"And media pundits who want him in big markets.  Talk to any espn outlet and they'll tell you Devin Booker wants out of Phoenix, yesterday.  Talk to Devin Booker and he'll tell you he wants to spend his career in Phoenix. Shit, you can't even use the ""Sarver bad"" argument to say he'll get pushed out because Booker is like one of the few Suns (much like Nash) who has a fantastic relationship with the owner. You can point to LMA, John Wall, but that's not a fair comparison when Booker is much closer to Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal than he is to either of the aforementioned.  Same crap with Beal, Lavine, and I promise if the Mavs don't put together a .650 team around Luka, he'll be the next subject of criticism. Hell, people still expect Dame to want to leave when he's dropping 50+ in losses as if his entire team isn't out for injury."
"Because it's a team game. It's long been a complaint of players like Trae Young and Devin Booker. Putting up great numbers while your team is playing like shit.   In addition to that some coaches don't enable players to do that. It's usually upcoming star players on trash teams, or established stars that haven't realized their on their way down that pad consistently."
"stay salty, enjoy wallowing in mediocrity with Devin ""empty stats"" Booker"
"I hate losing, but On the bright side, we took the Denver nuggets to double OT without Devin Booker, with Frank Kaminsky and Abdel Nader combining for 50 minutes. Additionally, Jokic, Murray, Morris, Kaminsky, and the refs were doing everything in their power to will the Nuggets to victory."
Imagine how good KAT will be in Phoenix with Devin Booker and CP3 next year!!
Yeah that's 2019-20 Devin Booker numbers right there: he put up 26.6 on 61.8 TS% last year.
2nd year Devin booker is better than both prime lebron and MJ
If Devin Booker took and elbow to the face and started bleeding would you be calling it a graze?   No one is mad at you and you're clearly not spitting facts.
"Personally, I’ve always put Donavon Mitchell and Devin Booker in the same overrated category. Maybe it’s just because 2 guards don’t impact the game in ways that other positions can."
"The player isn’t really what matters, it’s player development &amp; culture.  The ‘Stones have one of the worst owners in the NBA, who piggy banks the team &amp; could care less if they do well.  Donovan Mitchell &amp; Devin Booker would very likely be “busts” were they drafted to Detroit.  It’s the franchise, not the player, 90% of the time.  And Booker has only been thought highly of since the Suns cleaned up their act &amp; hired a real front office &amp; developmental/coaching staff, both things that the Gores will never likely do, therefore they’ll keep having players “bust”.   Utah has always had near-elite developmental &amp; Mitchell got to play under one of the best coaches in the league from day one"
I was so sure we’re would draft him.  Just like I was sure we had Donovan Mitchell but we got Luke Kennard.  And I was sure we were taking Devin Booker or Justise Winslow but we took Stanley Johnson.  Sacramento got a steal like he did in this clip
"So if Devin Booker flopped on a Jamal Murray drive and it turned into a 5 point swing, with the Suns winning, you would be fine with this? Sue me for caring about my team"
A Gary Harris flop turned the game and then Devin Booker got hurt. I am angry.
"Can someone please post the ~~Gary Harris flop~~ ""offensive"" foul on Devin Booker that Denver challenged?"
"Devin ""LeBron"" Booker"
Devin Booker is nice.  The all star appearance is coming
2 fantastic defensive plays by defensive juggernauts Nikola Jokic and Devin Booker
If I put 15 devin booker level players on a team I bet I could make the finals but that make him a top 10 player
Yeah just look at guys like Devin Booker. Idolized Kobe and Kobe just returned the love and lit a fire under his ass. RIP Mamba
"Devin Booker is my other choice, some people think hes a top 15 player"
Devin Booker.
"To be fair, it's an organization that helped build a legacy on great drafting.  It's not the most profitable franchise and it's not a guarantee that the fanbase will maintain any sort of interest in a tanking team.  Most fans aren't championship-or-bust minded.  There's something to be said for staying competitive and trying to pull a Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Kawhi, Devin Booker or Michael Porter Jr. around the middle of the first round."
As opposed to notable playoff performer Devin Booker
that elbow to kawhi’s neck reminded me i don’t like devin booker
Jamal Murray maybe? Jaylen Brown? Donovan Mitchell? Devin Booker is probably the one
But Devin Booker elbowing Kawhi in the throat gets no mention. Even Reggie Miller was on TV defending it.      Pat Bev is the 1st NBA player and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
Devin Booker
"This is Devin Booker though, NBA all-star playing against men, who would possibly be able to stop him"
"Put Devin Booker on Kentucky and he averages 30/5/5, they'll also win the whole damn thing beating everyone by 25"
"Yeah its kind of interesting how teams perceive whom opponents worst defenders are and how they attack them. It matters in the sense that their strategy and whom they decide to attack can influence the outcome of a game. It's not necessarily a correct evaluation of that defender they are going at though.   Everybody tries to attack James Harden and very often because they have him defend bigger players it translates to trying to post up vs Harden. Which is useless. Clippers just tried to go at Devin Booker whenever they could last night they basically told you what they think of his defense. But I dont think directly attacking his on ball defense like that is the way to exploit him. And that's the case with alot of these guys, many bad defenders are adequate on ball and trying to hunt them that way is fools gold."
"Cade Cunningham - Trevor Lawrence: Tall/Big generation talents that every team wants  Patrick Beverly - Jalen Ramsey (ramsey a lot better but the attitude and skillset): Defensive focused players in LA that are aggressive, get a lot of fouls, talk shit and love to take on the star player of the other team, heart and soul of team  Daniel Jones RJ Barrett:Young top 10 picks out of 2019 Duke that have been really good but sometimes inconsistent. Are both doubted and underrated by media  Kyler Murray Devin Booker or Lamelo Ball: Young exciting prospects out of Arizona (Besides Ball) that will be top players in the future  Aaron Donald Rudy Gobert: Large players that impact the entire defense of their team  DK Metcalf/Zion Williamson: Large freak athletes with a really bright future in the league  Baker Mayfeild Lonzo Ball: Top picks in their respective class that haven't panned out but are still good players, Lonzo is a lot like a QB and they both have been overshadowed by better players in their draft"
David West  Blake Griffin  James Harden  Sam Presti (TEAM)  Devin Booker

Are Damian Lillard and Devin Booker known for their defensive prowess or something? Were they even the primary defenders of PG in these games?
"His arm was in before he jumped. He reaches further off the ball, for something to push off of, but was jumping directly into kawhi’s throat, who, because Devin Booker has two arms and object permanence, connected with kawhi’s throat. The other option would have been his torso, where it would still be a leaping forearm, and a hard foul and a dangerous play.   No this wasn’t normal. It was dirty af."
The Clippers don’t say shit to Devin Booker 😂😂😂
"Lol he plants the arm to boost himself towards the ball. Pat bev got ejected for being jumped into by cp3 and Marcus Morris for complaining. Reggie Jackson legit took a blow to the eye, and didn’t get a call.   The clippers, as a team, had less ft than Devin Booker."
You’d think Devin Booker would be a bit more humble for a guy who’s never made an 8 seed. Maybe thats why he hasn’t.
Feel like I'm one of the only clipper fans that doesn't hate Devin Booker lmao
devin booker and dame are half the stars in the league apparently. funny how there’s no actual superstars on that list
For being soft Phoenix sure does have a hard time stopping Paul George. Devin “Don’t Double Me I Never been to the playoffs” Booker gonna keep talking and y’all will eat it up lmao
"Oh for fuck’s sake- again, what acting? There’s nothing in this commercial that you could call acting. He’s playing a basketball player telling you about a sandwich, and honestly it’s pretty believable. Like, nobody’s mistaking him for anyone else. He’s not acting. He’s just telling you about a sandwich. What’s your angle here? You mad because Devin Booker isn’t telling you about a sandwich? Do you think he’d tell you about a sandwich better than Tatum can? Who cares? Fucking dork."
"If you're saying Charles Barkley and Devin Booker, I don't see how that would happen. I'm talking realistically, as in there was genuinely a chance they could have teamed up. My bad if you're talking about someone else."
Devin Booker is a future MVP
"I hate all this “oh why isn’t so and so in the MVP conversation” talk. You don’t see a single person actually making a case for Devin Booker as the MVP, they just think he should be “in the conversation”. And that’s exactly why he isn’t in the conversation"
"He watched the game last night. He was live tweeting it! He just had a lapse in memory and made a bad take.   It’s interesting you’re talking about not criticizing someone without watching them all the time, because if you listen to Schlecht a lot, you would know he was very high on Devin Booker even before this season. But continue to harass him on Twitter for a 20 second clip that he apologized for."
"I'm not mad at the guy, but it fits the issue with covering Devin that people just haven't watched him but make claims about him. I get this is our first year of relevancy so I understand making mistakes to a level but anyone who watched that game last night saw how well Booker was on Mitchell"
"Devin Booker is averaging 26.1/4.1/4.5 on .495/.359/.857 splits, .598 TS%, 3.3 TOV/g and playing 34.1 MPG.  Chris Paul is averaging 16.3/4.7/8.8 on .493/.372/.926 splits, .592 TS%, 2.3 TOV/g and playing 32 MPG.  Considering the leadership and defense that CP3 brings, I'd say there's a good case for CP3 as the Sun's best player this year. And the Suns are pretty deep; Bridges, Ayton, Crowder, etc are all contributing really well to the team. It's not like Booker is carrying this team on his back like Jokic, Giannis and LeBron have been with their teams.  This is why Booker isn't in the MVP race."
"I am, I just don't like people in the media acting like he's the only reason. Where's Monty Williams' flowers? Where's the Devin Booker hype? I've heard more about Donovan Mitchell this whole season than Book and he's another underrated guy."
"If Devin Booker deserves to be in the MVP conversation, I deserve to be on to be on the cover of Sexiest Man Alive."
&gt;2nd best record in the NBA  &gt;Does Devin Booker impact winning?
"Just wait for the outrage when people realize that 4 of Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine and Bradley Beal wont even make an All NBA team this year. Have no idea which 2 even should of that group"
"Devin Booker is a really big trash talker, idk about the rest of them"
I agree all time but I don't think current CP3 is better than peak Nash. Nash didn't have a Devin Booker level player to help him. CP3 is also not currently a better scorer when you consider how much easier it is to score in the current NBA.

Mom said it’s my turn to post the Devin Booker stat.
"But seriously yes.   I’ve watched every suns game the last 3 years. I watched the suns be a shit stain of the NBA. A complete dumpster fire would be a compliment.   The Suns are a top team. With back to back Ws against the nuggets and jazz, 2-0 vs the leagues top team (for now), Ws against the Bucks, the 76ers, the Blazers, and the leagues best road record, an 8-0 bubble record, AND FRANK FUCKING KAMINSKY?   of course they are contenders.   Devin Booker has been embarrassing every single fucking defense this year with midrange mastery.  Chris Paul is State Farm.   Mikal Bridges puts the clamps on the opposing teams star day in and day out.   Luka Doncic is 1-7 vs. Deandre Ayton.   As an AZ sports fan, the real test comes in the playoffs where AZ sports always fall short, unless it’s the Phoenix Mercury or 2001 diamondbacks.   You’re god damn right we’re contenders."
"I got two words for you. Devin Booker and Chris Paul, must see TV"
I bet Devin booker has the Suns winning the championship and has more sex than any of us
Get my man Devin Booker out of Phoenix
Lol no. Devin Booker has been one of the best clutch players since he’s gotten into the league
Utah scored 38 points and allowed 26 points in that quarter. Snyder is a fantastic coach. He neutralized Booker. I think Devin scored mostly on transition if I'm not mistaken.
Finally we have the solution to the Mitchell vs Booker debate.   Devin Mitchell
I hereby nominate Devin Booker as an MVP candidate.
Devin Booker doesn't look like a teenager anymore
Gonna give my best guesses here not in any particular order....  Zion  Luka  Tatum  Ja Morant   SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander)  Jaylen Brown   Ben Simmons  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Brandon Ingram
Devin Booker?  More like Devin BOOGER.  Get SMOKED Phoenix!
To piggyback of a highly upvoted comment:  * Devin Booker is overrated af * The Suns are pretenders
"Zach Lavine is what people think Devin Booker is. But then again, I'm biased as a Bulls fan"
I mean devin booker is great on ball too
"Frankly, my tank is Paul and I'm in Payne. Dario say, Mikal-ory intake today exceeded Ayton because I kept saying I'll Etwaun Moore Cam Crowder. - Devin Booker"
"I'm not going to debate you that Edwards needs to be a good 3pt shooter to be an effective player (I think you underselling his ability to drive to the rim which can be extremely elite and his defensive potential).  Second the limitation is not accounting for volume, while volume is a variable that should be considered, the point I was making is that a raw 3% is suitable to alot of noise because there are abuch of uncounted variables that you are ignoring, and the overall assumption that good 3% == being a good shooter is incorrect . I mean look at your own chart you provided do you think that Otto Porter is a better shooter than PG, Kemba, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker ... the list goes on. Also consider in 2016 Bradley Beal avg 7.6 3pt attempts having a 40% percentage, this season he is averaging 6.5 attempts at 33% if you just looked at it you would think Beal became worse at shooting but this is the wrong conclusion the reason why the drop off happened is that in 2016 he had John Wall in his prime and Beal was a second option making his shots alot more easier, but it is also obvious in the last 5 years Beal has become a much better shooter and scorer.  Because of these factor your cannot properly test your hypothesis that players do not get better at shooting."
This sounds a lot like Devin Booker. Now that he is on a great defensive team and his team is winning his defensive rating has improved dramatically. The narrative has changed for Booker just like it can for Trae.
Devin Booker solely on the fact that Drake has mentioned him and has not mention Mitchell and I think thats the deciding factor
"Defense is not 50% of the game, especially for a point guard. If you think that we would've been a better team last season if we replaced Trae with an average offensive and average defensive pg then I don't know what to tell you.   The article you listed cites Devin Booker as the 2nd worst defender in the league but something tells me you probably still think he's one of the top players in the league."
I been saying this. Devin booker keeps getting disrespected as a top 20 all time player
House Suns: House Grizzlies sent the wrong Brooks!  Devin Booker: Are you bloody seriou (never finished saying serious)?
Devin booker is already 24 and I doubt he will get much better. Switch him and lamelo.
"They just barely made the league and we're out pretty quick, neither made much of an impression.   They played for Kentucky next to Karl Anthony-Towns, Devin Booker, and Willy Cauley-Stein and we're decently important parts of that team."
if the suns pass the jazz Devin booker is a dark house. Best player best team and he is actually our most valuable player despite what the national media and casuals will tell you.
No one has said Devin Booker yet? Guy straight up looks like a cartoon
Wait they moved up to draft Zach Collins 💀.  the Heat have had bad draft picks but they never traded up for a bust lol. Heat got screwed out of D. Rose. And they drafted Justice Winslow because he was supposedly BPA and Devin Booker was already drafted
Devin Booker
"As someone who has never, ever watched the suns play this season, and only instead thinks what people in the media say about the suns, I 100% confirm and agree with this sentiment. It is all chris paul's effect. Especially when Chris Paul isn't on the floor at the same time as devin booker"
Cassius Stanley was 20 when he graduated from HS.  I believe Devin booker was 18 when he was drafted.
"For LaMelo, I just noticed that he is 5 years younger than Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker.  Holy cow."
Devin Booker is too low. Honestly switch him with LaMelo IMO
Devin Booker
Devin Booker still under 25 in like his 7th season

"How in the world do these guys get slept on in the draft? Devin booker, Kawhi, Donovan Mitchell, etc."
"I can see why Doncic won Player of the Week for the West but I wanted to give a shoutout to Booker because it was very close.  Luka Doncic: (4-0 vs OKC, BOS, NYK, WAS): 28.3 ppg, 6.75 rpg, 6.25 apg on 54.4/40.5/52.2 percent shooting splits  Devin Booker: (4-0) vs CHO, ATL, CHI, OKC): 33.3 ppg, 3.75 rpg, 3.75 apg on 51.7/39.3/93.8 percent shooting splits"
"I can see why they gave it Player of the Week to Doncic but I wanted to give Booker a shoutout for his performance. He's seen a reduction in his counting stats this year but the team has been balling out:  Luka Doncic (4-0 vs OKC, BOS, NYK, WAS): 28.3 ppg, 6.75 rpg, 6.25 apg on 56.0/38.4/47.2 shooting.  Devin Booker: (4-0 vs CHO, ATL, CHI, OKC): 33.3 ppg, 3.75 rpg, 3.75 apg on 51.6/41.3/95.4 shooting."
I don't want to watch Devin Booker game winning buzzer beaters 4 times in a row.  I would rather play any other team.
"Ayton was a consensus number one pick, quite frankly I think if Phoenix played dragan bender one more minute, James Jones might’ve been assassinated by devin booker"
"Yeah but you said probably better, that’s like saying Devin Booker is probably better than MPJ.  Garland is developing into a great player but he has a sizeable gap in development until he’s at Ja’s level"
Devin Booker was saying it to be exact.
"Many Suns fans think Suns have the recipe to make deep playoff pushes. Top 10 in both offense and defense. Players who shoot the mid range inefficient shots very well that playoff teams force other teams to take (Chris Paul and Devin Booker both do very well). Many people argue this is one of the reasons Kobe was so successful in the playoffs. A good mix of elite defenders, shooters, and playmakers. Only thing is Lakers have Lebron and AD, Utah Jazz are like Super charged Suns in that they are even better at defense and offense, Nuggets were the top 2 or 3 seed last two years and still got those same players, and going down the line every team has a case to be very excited. Just depends on who shows up. If I was that confident I would put money where my mouth is and put money on them since they are such an underdog but I won't."
"Im still on the idea that using advanced stats to reinforce an MVP campaign is sus only in the sense that we *know* voters don't vote on advanced stats unless it is extremely significant.  Anyone can use statistics and frame it in a way to push their agenda.  OP is pushing the Jokic campaign, but there is more than enough opportunity to frame an Embiid MVP campaign or Lebron, or Harden, or fucking someone like Devin Booker if you want."
"This. We also give up more midrange than anybody, can tag one of devin Booker or cp3 with oNeale...but don’t know who guards the other guy. Conversely you guys do well at guarding the 3 but our spacing has proved all year teams got to decide on whether you guard the three and let gobert get his dunks on or let one shooter get open.  One game is one game but I think the deciding factor in say, a series, would be if gobert can have his way with ayton.   If ayton can hold his own (which he did last game but not historically) - i lean you guys. But that’s an important and big if.   Gonna be a great game considering we’re both top dogs atm"
Gotta match salaries for the Devin Booker trade in 2 years

"Yeah, having a front office that passed on Paul George, Kemba, Giannis, Klay, Devin Booker, and Donovan Mitchell definitely didn't help."
"He's been bad in the clutch this season, but he is historically pretty solid.  Devin Booker and Chris Paul are still working through how to run the offense in the final 5 minutes.  Right now they seem to just be taking turns shooting off an iso, but I'll feel much more confident in the team once the offense starts to flow again in the 4th."
Devin Booker clutch performance this year is bad and they play to their level of competition. Very good team but it took OKC putting out their B team for Phoenix to finally just do what they should do against a bad team from the start  It also took until recently for their [starting lineup to finally break positive in net rating for the season](https://go.nba.com/wgfy) took a while for it to start working and that’s often what they’ll play late in games
Devin Booker is atrocious in the clutch
"Just so we're clear: you're taking **Devin Booker** over Luka, Harden, Steph, KD, Tatum, and Kawhi."
Devin Booker would be a top 5 player if you didn't count the first top 10 guys
Devin Booker is adequately ated in this league
devin booker received the 26th most all star votes from fans. He received more votes than:   * Chris Paul   * Rudy Gobert   * Ben Simmons  * Kyle Lowry   * Nikola Vucevic   * CJ McCollum   * SGA  I'd say he is properly rated
Devin Booker is regarded as a top 5 player in the league how is he underrated?
"I really wished Stanley Johnson would come good. Especially considering we chose him over Michigan native, Piston fan Devin Booker. Fml."
I got a lot of heat for suggesting he was about as good as Devin Booker during last season .
Devin Booker for sure
"&gt;Trae Young is the best PG in the draft, leading all draft-eligible players in FPG and second in FPM. However, he struggled down the stretch and his defense and turnover numbers leave a lot to be desired. His ceiling projects as more of a second tier PG at the next level – more Kemba Walker than Chris Paul.  I had him in the top tier in that draft, which consisted of 4 players: Trae, Luka, MPJ, and JJJ.  &gt;I think many people will be shocked to see De’Andre Hunter listed as one of the least safe players in the draft. It basically comes down to how you feel about his defense. Hunter is routinely listed as an elite defender, and he in fact won ACC Defender of the Year. But on tape, he’s just brutally bad. His 1.2% STL this year puts him in the Devin Booker range as a defender. His off-ball defense alternates between lazy and lost. His sense of spacing and angles is pretty much non-existent. His on-ball defense was okay but was largely helped by Virginia’s pack line. I just don’t see it. Maybe he’s the elite defender everybody seems to think he is, and if he is, he’s a valuable player. His offense is rudimentary but more than functional for a defensive specialist. But it’s nowhere near good enough if his defense is as bad as the stats and tape look. I think betting on Hunter to become the first player in recent memory to be an above average defender with a STL% that low is a bad bet.  I had him in tier 4 in that draft, which was post-lottery first round pick. Haven't gotten to watch him this year. Just took a quick glance at his numbers, but other than unsustainable shooting from mid-range (that will regress whenever he comes back), I don't see anything that really stands out."
"I’d argue we’re still feeling the consequences of that draft, it set us back so damn much.   Also you’re so lucky you have Devin Booker ... I was SCREAMING for us to take him in the draft, he’s literally a Pistons fan from Michigan, and we fuckkn took Stanley Johnson 😭"
"while I agree it usually doesn't matter, I think there's something to be said for the fact DeMars assists come largely via 3s. I imagine his 7 assists might be worth more than some other players' 7 assists. or to focus more on the spirit of the post, I'm not sure where the stats are now, but we can compare DeMar and Devin Booker.   DeMar was scoring 20 points to Booker's 24 but he averaged twice the assists on half the turnovers.  if we call each assist worth 2.5 points and say it's 50/50  that the assists come from 2s and 3s, that would mean DeMar is creating 37.5 ppg compared to Booker's 34.5, but DeMar was averaging 1.7 to Booker's 3.5 turnovers. most people consider DeRozan a top 40ish player and Booker in that 20ish range, and they're both similar defenders.    then who would you think is the more valuable offensive player with that context? if DeMar is generating more points on half the turnovers and both of them get their value from offense, one would think DeMar is better, even though realistically he's probably not. I don't think DeMar necessarily deserved the all star over Booker, it's just an interesting thing to talk about. there was such a huge public outcry about Booker not getting in at first but much less about DeMar, even though you could argue the numbers show he has more value. it's just weird how assists aren't thought of the same way because the passer didn't get the bucket."
Devin Booker
"IDK about best (definitely top 3), but the fact that there was a post last week where folks said they'd rather have Devin Booker shows just how underrated KAT is."
"&gt;four locks at guard: Steph, Luka, Dame, CP3  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Devin Booker who has had great team success this year but does he deserve it? The individual stats are not good.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;locks ar guard...CP3  Booker has better stats than CP3..."
Mitchell is possible. Devin Booker too. And Ben Simmons.
"Uh no, harden was the leagues mvp that season lol. He was easily our best player, yes even in the golden state series. This isn’t Devin booker"

Am I wrong for thinking hes gonna be an athletic Devin Booker with decent defense? he is a walking bucket
"I said the same thing, until I saw the replay from a different angle that was directly in front of Devin booker. As he was getting in the shot pocket, Powell’s right hand went in for the steal, but he hit the opposite side of Devin Booker’s elbow on the off hand"
Holy shit you must have never watched devin booker play in your life. He's going through a rough patch but the guy has proved time and time again that he can come up in big moments over the last 6 years. He gets most of his points in the paint and from midrange. He will thrive in the playoffs. Fuck outta here with that nonsense
"Devin Booker played 65 games, Chris Paul played 68 games, Deandre Ayton played 69 games, Mikal Bridges played 69 games. Your team has been healthy the entire fucking season.  Quit lying LMFAO"
"How is it fair for Devin Booker to be fouled but since it wasn’t “blatant” enough for you, they don’t call it. Get your salty ass outta here."
let it be known devin booker hates people with homes
let it be known devin booker hates people with homes
God bless you Devin Booker  *I totally did not say that you were playing like ass 10 seconds before the foul and no one can prove it.*
I LOVE DEVIN BOOKER
There is no way that Devin Booker is All-NBA. I know that he was already on the outside looking in but he still has a ways to go before he’s one of the top 15 players in the NBA
devin booker has been embarrassing tonight man
Devin Booker and Chris Paul's playoff careers have been extraordinary 🤣
"are you saying its not possible that Ant is 27-5-5 on the 8th best team in the west, resulting in his name on the short list? I really want to stress that I'm neither expecting or banking on this, but that gets you into the conversation ala Zack Lavine or Devin Booker."
"The only time the Wolves made the playoffs in years was because of him. He also was the best player during the playoffs for Philly. And everyone had the same advantages and disadvantages in the bubble so not sure why that suddenly doesn't count. Sounds like you just have an extreme bias against him for no reason. You sound like a whiny child.   And if Jimmy is a bum, let me ask you this. You believe Devin Booker is a bum too, correct? Since he's never even been to the playoffs."
"Maybe they need a Zion injury again :)  But they might need to get a bit lucky. Guys like Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Myles Turner, Jusuf Nurkić, Clint Capela have all been picked in that range in recent years. We'll see."
"See the reality is kids of superstars almost never live up to the hype. Now kids of role players? I’m looking at Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Devin Booker, Damontas Sabonjs. Oh yeah let me get some Joe Ingles and mash it up with a little Matysse Thybulle hmmm"
"I don't know dude, pretty sure if you haven't won by 23 your basically never going to win. Its clear based on all the reactions hot takes on this sub reddit that every team should win championships by the time players hit their mid 20s or else.they are busts. Look at the last 5 or 6 championship teams. They where lead by legendary young players like Kyle Kuzma, and Og Anunoby. Guys like matthew dellavedova and nick young. Guys like Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Zion williamson, Devin Booker, are over the hump has beens that missed their chance to compete in this league"
"I think given his potential to have a potentially better potential next year, and the notion that players don’t get better linearly and obese women singing and how he went 14th in the draft while playing monstrously grand  total of 51 minutes of college basketball and probably would’ve gone 1st if not for lumbar obstacles, coupled with his already good shotmaking ability, its plausible to say there’s a good of chance he could develop into a KD-level player or a tall Devin Booker or even a Kyle singler."

"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from a week ago so even if he's eclipsed some of these players since then, the point still stands."
"&gt; Switching into guards like Curry, Booker, Kyrie, etc. is still probably a bad idea because those guys are just unreal on the offensive end.  That applies to literally everyone in the league though.  Obviously you don't want him guarding guys like that all game long but he does *shockingly* well in short bursts.  Someone posted that clip of Devin Booker absolutely demolishing Gobert a week ago as proof that he doesn't deserve DPOY- the thing is, t[here are clips of him doing exactly the same thing to guys like Lu Dort and Ben Simmons and Bam/Jimmy Butler](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/5/12/22431989/nba-awards-ballot-mvp-nikola-jokic-joel-embiid) (scroll down to DPOY)."
"Really didn’t think the Warriors would have a chance on the second night of a back to back against a full Suns squad. I really love how the Warriors use the Sun’s overplay against Steph against them, back door cuts, fake hand offs, lobs over defenders looking for Steph. Everybody growing up is always taught to keep an eye on the ball and an eye on your man, against the Warriors, you gotta keep an eye out for Steph as well. Damn proud of the Warriors. For the Suns: Devin Booker is a fucking problem, scores at will and near impossible to defend 1 on 1. CP3 did his usual thing too. And wtf, Cameron Payne was killing it too in his reserve minutes.  Only thing I thought sucked for the Suns was Deandre Ayton, I really thought he would punish small ball Warriors and Kevon Looney, but he didn’t really do shit"
"I'll believe it when I see it, but maybe Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker have a superstar run through the playoffs to win it all. Felt like Donovan kinda made that leap during the bubble, and with Bojan playing great and being healthy, who knows. It could be the Jazz's turn this year. This'll be Booker's first playoffs, so I'm a little less sure about him, but I hope he goes off. Both of them have veteran backcourt mates with playoffs experience in Conley and CP3, so I'm hoping for the best."

Shout out Devin Booker for getting my man Juan T into hustle mode in the second quarter
This is for Beal.  - Devin Booker probably.
Devin Booker is a modern day Adrian Dantley
1. I live in Maryland so Jalen Smith 2. Devin Booker is cool 3. CP3 getting a ring would be cool 4. Unironically me liking the jerseys was part of the reason

"&gt;Here’s an indication of Adebayo’s defensive versatility: In its game notes highlighting the 23-year-old’s prowess at that end, the Heat talk about his success against guards, limiting them to 38.9% shooting this season, including 31.8% on 3-pointers.

"Watched high school Devin Booker score 40 of his team’s 47 points and sink a 3/4 court buzzer beater to beat my high school team.  More of a Booker fan, but the suns are growing on me."
"Agreed. Beal just reminds me of Devin Booker and once they added a legit playmaker to that team (CP) they’re the best team in the league. I dont think Beal can be a number 1 ball handler, volume scorer sure, but a teams true number 1, I personally just don’t see it. Also Klay has averaged 18.9 ppg, 3.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists when Steph has sat over 90 games.

"Idk if it's only bc I watched us beat the Suns last night, but   - Devin Booker: for as much as he hates the double teams in the summer) he's reached a level of superb ability where, like kobe, all the shots he takes are these difficult, contested, on-his-own-pace jump shots that SOMEHOW float in. It's pretty fuckin impressive - Chris Paul: I sound like a total dork but his passes are so fucking beautiful every time. This man is only like 6'0 throwing PERFECT live dribble passes to the weakside while being contained by his own teammate, the other team's guard, and the 7 footer guarding his teammate. And when i say perfect i mean shot pocket every time! AND HE DOESNT EVEN TELEGRAPH IT LIKE A CHUMP!  - Mikal Bridges: Idk how but he makes layups like his contract is based on layups made per game. Long ass arms and he just doesn't seem to EVER miss em (maybe it's the pickup baller in me that's only impressed bc I've missed my fair share of layups)"
"Not surprised about the fouling for the 100 points. I mean Devin Booker did the same, it's an achievement for sure but just less impressive if done like that imo."
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"out of everyone yall should be the ones sympathizing with us with Devin ""empty stats"" Booker and the Ayton pick lol. I guess the blowout made you hate us"
"Who we gonna bandwagon this playoffs? Feeling like the Suns are pretty good looking. They have Jae Crowder, Devin Booker needs more respect, Chris Paul has somehow morphed into a likeable veteran who deserves a ring, and their fans are some of the few who don't viscerally hate our franchise and would probably welcome us (I think)"
"Yeah but this is a problem in basketball discourse, most talented player isn't necessarily best player.   KD was absolutely the most talented player on those Warriors teams, but that doesn't mean he was the best player.  The best player on a team is the most important player, the one that the team can't stomach their loss or they drastically suffer in terms of W/L record, the player that impacts winning the most. There was never a point in time where DeMar DeRozan was better than Kyle Lowry despite being more talented and putting up superior stats. There was never a point in time where Blake Griffin was better than Chris Paul despite being more talented and putting up superior stats, similar story with Devin Booker this year. Donovan Mitchell is not better than Mike Conley this season, despite being more talented and putting up superior stats.   KD has never impacted wins/losses as much as his reputation has suggested he has, the reason why nobody ever talks about it, is his most glaring weakness (playmaking and creating for others on offense) has been covered up by the fact that he's played with an MVP point guard for the entirety of his career who has fulfilled that role."
Yeah no shit he’s an all star caliber player I just don’t think he’ll be selected to the team if the Thunder sucks. Same thing happened with Devin Booker
"Simple, because I'm a Phoenix Suns fan and I expect the worst.   (By the way, we beat the defending champs with Lebron playing and an ejected Devin Booker, so it's not like it's completely hopeless. And that same ""fully healthy"" Lakers team lost to a Sacramento Kings team without De'Aaron Fox or Harrison Barnes, so calm down a little bit on your hype-up of them.)"
"Devin Booker: ""We out"""
Devin Booker
Devin Booker dog water man. People who think the suns have a shot this year are delusional. First round exits
"You have Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton, you guys were further along than we were. Shit, we expected another tanking year.  You guys were on the up and up and you added CP3."
He ain't losing his hair but can someone please photoshop Devin Booker bald 'cause I swear he has a super weird elongated dome under there.
"That's a stupid metric. You're trying to value something based off its very peak. You could then argue that ""at their best"", Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jason Tatum, hell even a Fred VanVleet type with one huge game are all comparable to AD then."
"Kyrie did not dominate to the extent LeBron did and it wasn’t close. I don’t think you appreciate what it means to lead both teams in every category.   Also Kyrie’s *entire* reputation is built off those playoff runs LeBron took him on, without them he’s Devin Booker. He gets more than enough credit."
"Are we really sure Luka is that much better at defense? I hear he is ""much improved on defense this year trust me"" about him every year like I do about other bad defenders like Enes Kanter, Devin Booker etc. Not to say on/off is the end all be all but just glancing [at it](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) Luka is even worst on defensive on/off this year than he has any other year by far and he has always been a net negative on that end."
He'd be Devin Booker but a little better on offense and defense
"Whole lotta guys that blow our minds today, there won't be room in the history books for them. Anyone really gonna talk about Jimmy Butler? He's so godlike that the nba-viewing world collectively apologized last year for not treating him like a god. It'd take a quality documentary or else I predict that whole episode gets forgotten. On the other hand, he can and should do great things post-career. I trust him more than any other NBA player to have himself a strong second half.  I'm having a hard time envisioning a future where people spend any time talking about Zach LaVine, Bradley Beal, or KAT. But they have time left to change that. Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are currently getting themselves off that list, so it's a thing that can be done."
Devin Booker in 2016...
"Devin Booker. He’s kept the Suns in so many games, but all you hear about is Chris Paul. I feel like that will be the story of his career. Once he has success in the playoffs it will be x,y, or z factor propelled the Suns."
It may be unrealistic but I don’t think that’s as unbreakable as people think. Kobe was only 19 points away. Devin booker had 70. I honestly think it can be done under the right circumstances. With the way the 3pt shot has exploded I can see someone eventually getting hot enough to reach it or at least come close. But the fact that Kobe was only 19 away is crazy.
Well tbf Devin Booker has never been in the playoffs 😈
"He's a true shooting guard imo and he doesn't necessarily need to be a true playmaker. I think of a guy like Devin Booker -- one of the league's best scorers, and the perfect fit for him imo is with a true playmaking PG (like CP3). Booker *can* be a playmaker but I'd rather him not be the #1 playmaker, and I can see the same type of peak for Green"
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
"A ton. Devin Booker, DeJounte Murray, Jamal Murray, Jonas Valanciunas to name a few."
&gt; Theres a decent chance this will be the best Suns team of the Devin Booker era there’s a fair bit riding on this year  I said at the trade deadline that because of this the Suns should mortgage everything and anything they can to make win now moves
Unless you’re Devin Booker dropping 70 on the Celtics

"the true highlight of this game was Clyde Frazier referencing the ""Kardashian Curse"" in relation to Devin Booker lol"
"He's just making shots dude, it's like Devin Booker, you can't always stop it"
"Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Ben Simmons, Myles Turner. Two guys who are great ball handlers in Murray and Simmons, great scorers in Booker and Murray, and some lockdown defense from Bridges, Simmons, and Turner."
Damn I’m the opposite. I like CP3 but Devin Booker strongly annoys me. Don’t get me wrong he’s an incredible player and usually a pleasure to watch. It’s more just some of the shit I hear him saying that I don’t like.
Devin Booker has never played a playoff game. Safer to pick elsewhere imo.
What about CP3 and Devin Booker? 🤔
You just expect devin booker to drop 70 points everytime bs the mavs
in the regular season. devin booker as your 1st option will not cut it. people say the jazz have no shot at making the finals because they have no superstar and then claim the suns are contenders. the suns are a classic regular season team (ironic but still). only way they make the finals is if they have a fluke run like the heat
Hell even Devin Booker has vouched for him over the years since he left the Suns   I definitely feel like it’s the latter
I wouldn’t say that makes him the better player. Just that he’s the better closer. Devin booker is definitely the best player on the team overall at this point in CP3s career.
this game had devin booker getting flashbacks lmao

"&gt; Not at all. Pascal Siakam was MIP and second team all NBA. Devin Booker will be neither. Kyle Lowry wasn't considered their best player, Siakam was. CP3 is considered the Suns best player and leader. This could be bias but the difference in perception matters.  Yep, that's true. It's moreso that there was a misperception about who the best player on the team was last year (it was still Kyle), so the all-nba went to the perception. But at the same time the team had very even strength among its top seven players, so we were performing not really off the back of one player."
"Not at all. Pascal Siakam was MIP and second team all NBA. Devin Booker will be neither. Kyle Lowry wasn't considered their best player, Siakam was. CP3 is considered the Suns best player and leader. This could be bias but the difference in perception matters. Also, CP3 joining the team turned them from a 10th seed to a first/second seed. Completely different circumstances. Only similarities are point guard. CP3 also is shooting way better than Lowry did while turning the ball over way less."
Devin Booker and Suns fans rejoicing rn since this BS is over
Honestly the fact he's been practically unmentioned after taking a young phoenix team to the 1 seed is disrespectful. Like Devin Booker might score more points but they ain't a contender without CP3.
"Without picking any of the locks, i think a realistic team of:  PG: Trae Young (CP3 would be ideal here, but i don't think he plays)  SG: Jimmy Butler/Devin Booker  SF: jason Tatum  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Bam Adebayo  &amp;#x200B;  Should be able to win it all."
"Chris Paul   Devin Booker     Mikal Bridges   Torrey Craig   Deandre Ayton   Yes, I just listed the Suns starting 5"
"IIRC, they had their sights on George Karl, which didn’t sound terrible at the time, but he was just an awful coach for us. Him and Boogie hated each other  And Malone and boogie were great together. So they really pissed off our franchise player, combined with drafting another center in the lottery like that season or the one after  Sigh.. it could’ve been devin booker and instead we got willie fuckin Cauley stein"
"Yes I'm sure Devin Booker is absolutely livid with battling for the 1 seed in his first playoff berth in 6 seasons     Him and CP3 have the exact same mentality, it's a big part of why this is working so well."
"That and the fact that he was older by rookie standards, which scares a lot of teams off for one reason or another. As someone who doesn't have the time to follow college much, it was definitely disheartening to see that we had reached hard on a rookie older than Devin Booker that nobody really expected to go top 20, let alone in the lottery. This also came immediately after the TJ Warren trade which looked godawful at the time. Oh, and those two moves were the first things James Jones did after being hired as the official GM of the team, so it all looked pretty questionable. Luckily, we see how it has turned out though.  Cam has definitely put in the work to prove the doubters wrong, even if he has been slumping hard from three as of late. I love having the kid on the team and hope he stays for a long time."
Devin Booker is having a beast of a season but going somewhat under the radars
"He’s at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He’s at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He’s at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn’t worth anything close to what he’s making. He’s turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don’t make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."

"He averages 4.8 shots per game at the rim this year. That's not a lot by any means, but is on par with Luka Doncic, Anthony Davis and more than Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard and Devin Booker. Is that a good enough sample size for you?"
"lol shut up. you don't know anything.   nba players are just kids like my kids. my son played CoD with devin booker and they jsut talked normal shit, it wasn't for some stupid advertisement or promotion, they're just gamers."
Devin “***no doubling in the pickup runs! we are working on our game***” Booker
"Devin ""lets work on our game"" Booker"
Devin “we not doubling” Booker
And to get to 70 he  can ask Devin booker
I had them as my dark horse contender in the west. Had hawks in the East which didn’t turn out great. I don’t know how people saw a team that had devin booker and a good supporting cast add a all time great and not be a top 4-5 seed at least. Chris Paul takes scrubs to the 8-7 seed he could take a good core even higher
"Ironic statement about a guy who averages the most assists in the league and has less of a usage rate then Luka, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving Damian Lillard, and about 10 other guys."
"And by that criteria, then it would be between Devin Booker and Chris Paul lol"
Devin Booker
"Devin booker, MPJ, and Dame all did that in the last 2 weeks too.  Lots of NBA legacy stats are meaningless now"
Lol Devin booker also made the all star team.
"Same, but for Devin Booker."
Ben Simmons cuckolded by Devin Booker
Devin Booker
"I never get the hype of him being a great GM.. where did that even come from? Why the Pels fan act like they got their version of Masai Ujiri   Zion about to get his 3rd head coach in his 3 years in the league.. still so many problems for them to address. What kind of players do you put around Zion, what offensive scheme, how much do you want Zion to handle the ball, is NAW and Hayes starter caliber player? … it’s like the Devin Booker early years with the Suns.. just a clump of players and one potential superstar, I guess they’re better than the Suns were bc they have Ingram locked on long term"
Russ also missed 15 games that year which is a lot for him. Ibaka missed 18 games that year as well.  If either of those guys don't miss significant time they make they playoffs bc they finished tied with the Pelicans but they lost the tiebreaker.   In hindsight they should have just semi-tanked that year and they could have gotten Devin Booker.
"*Monkey Paw curls*  ""I can't believe what we're seeing, but it looks like Devin Booker has just spontaneously exploded into a million tiny pieces, right in the middle of these Conference Finals"""
"I think of Devin Booker as a great shooter, and he's won 3-point shooting contests, but he's a career 35% from 3."
FOH if Devin Booker said this you wouldn't have any complaints
He's going to end up on the Devin Booker path of being a top 5 guard in the league with no recognition.
"""imagine if you had a rookie in the western conference finals"" no thanks.   Also thank god devin booker has basically played point for us. Could be useful to give cam some rest if CP3 is out for a bit."
"That team vs  Trae young, DEvin booker, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Gobert"
They have Chris Paul and Devin Booker.   That's the difference lol
I see they're going with the Devin Booker method of development with him. Yikes.
"Better question:   Replace Deandre Ayton and Devin Booker with Russ and Beal, who gets better who gets worse?"
"In the immortal words of Devin Booker, Harden was thinking, ""We're in good shape.""."
I agree with you... but Devin Booker's career is literally defined as being held back from individual accolades because of lack of team success.  The only argument people have ever made for Booker is that he wasn't winning. If he wins the NBA finals it completely removes the main criticism of Devin Bookers career
"Devin Booker mentioned that Kobe was looking down on him in that series win against the Lakers... Kobe and Giannis trained together so I wonder what Kobe would say about these stupid turnovers and decisions by Giannis. It's not all on him but when it counts the most, he chokes. I told my roommate when we were up early that this lead is nothing and I was right. It's a wonderful time to be a Wisconsin sports fan 😵🔫"
alright we need to protect the remaining West players someone get that “Suns in four” fighting fan and get him to do detail for Devin Booker this is looking serious
Hope he's able to play. Him and Devin Booker have been a pleasure to watch in these playoffs so far.
"hey chris paul found himself the perfect partner, it remains to ask whether devin booker found the same"
Devin booker getting cheated again
"No I still think he can be the best player on a championship team, but like Shaq he's going to need a co-star not a sidekick, even though Kobe was the sidekick for the first ring he did Elevate to that co-star level for the second and third championships that they got together, Giannis with somebody like a Devin Booker would really be ideal"
Also I guess Devin Booker is Luffy post Wano.
"I honestly feel like I’ve read this 20 times at this point. Are people still surprised by this? Narratives are hard to change I guess. “Harden sucks at defense” is one of them, just like “Gobert gets played off the court in the playoffs” or “Devin Booker isn’t a superstar just a high-volume scorer”."
"Well that's not true. I would have Kyrie and Beal ahead of him, but plenty of advanced stats give Mitchell an extremely easy argument to at least be in the conversation and likely ahead of at least one or two of those four, if you don't want to have a more drawn out comparison.  538's RAPTOR has Mitchell (3.8), Kyrie (3.5), Beal (3.3), Trae (2.5), Booker (2.2). ESPN's RPM has Kyrie (3.44), Mitchell (2.50), Booker (2.23), Trae (2.22), Beal (1.90). Bball-index's LEBRON has Kyrie (3.38), Beal (2.77), Trae (2.28), Mitchell (1.70), Booker (1.19). Basketball Reference's WS/48 has Kyrie (.189), Mitchell (.167), Trae (.163), Beal (.132), Booker (.104) and BPM has Kyrie (5.3), Trae (3.6), Mitchell (3.5), Beal (3.2), Booker (-0.1). Side-note: all-in-one advanced stats apparently hate Devin Booker."
"I don't really have a problem with teams who signed their stars in free agency, at the end of the day a good team is a good team regardless of how the players got there.   That being said it would be cool to see a team like the Jazz or Suns make it to the finals. The Jazz do admittedly have the more ""naturally formed"" team, since the Suns got CP3, but for a guy like Devin Booker who was criticised for not being able to lead a team to wins, and remained loyal to the Suns despite pressure to request a trade, it would be awesome to see him succeed."
"Also the glaring error of not switching into Harden on every offensive possession. The man is injured and out of shape and he played 46 minutes with literally no worries. Devin Booker would have butchered him out of the game within 5 minutes. Is Bud trying to be a gentleman or something? It's the second round of the playoffs, not the last game of Harden's retirement tour."
Devin booker snubbed big time
Devin Booker.
"&gt;With Luka clearly being the most valuable player in the NBA from a Front Office standpoint, who is the second most valuable player in the league?  &gt;A few things matter to this I feel. Age, offensive skill, defensive skill, contract, and that x-factor.  &gt;Candidate wise a few guys come to mind. Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, LeBron James, Devin Booker, and Donovan Mitchell  &gt;Who do you guys think the second most valuable player is in the NBA and if you have the time, why?  &gt;Edit: I forgot Jokic"
"So weird not seeing James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell on the list. And yet, I don't see anything wrong with these choices (other than Jimmy Butler).     This league is way too talented."
Like don't get me wrong tell George had a good year but this is a guy that's known to wet the bed constantly. Why not throw somebody else on there like Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker. This is garbage.
It has Clint Capella over Devin Booker.  Lol indeed. 538 should stick to their dumb models which undercount Republican votes or whatever they do during election season.
Cp3 Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton :-) Go suns!
Offensive that Devin Booker has been snubbed a-fucking-gain
The Devin Booker disrespect continues.  Unreal.
"I’d rather have Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikhail Bridges, Jae Crowder and Deandre Ayton."
"Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker have been robbed in my estimation.  And perhaps Westbrook and Trae.   Who do I take off?   Well, Butler for sure. He's got there on name only. He had a subpar season for sure.   No doubt in my mind that Booker and Mitchell played better than him this year.   Bradley Beal too. I mean, if Westy ain't going to make it, how is the second best player on his team going to make it? And over two guys who play the same position and led their teams to the top of the west?   But damn... it's hard to fit Westy and Trae on there."
"Mikal Bridges ranks 68th percentile in defensive EPM. Using these stats to say Booker is a poor defender is unbelievably dumb.  If you watch the Suns play and defend, it would be extremely obvious that Devin was not a bad defender this year."
Devin Armani Booker
"Which is the point right?  Devin Booker last year 27/4/7 on 62% TS, missed the play-in by half a game, and received 3 All-NBA third-team votes.  Russ was the 3rd team guard also finishing ahead of him was Beal, Lowry, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, and Kemba Walker. Booker finished 12th in guard voting.  There is definite rewarding of winning for certain guys on that list but not others."
"&gt; Booker has a way better team than Beal, and the Wizards almost made the playoffs with an awful team, oh yeah, and he also has better numbers  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Devin Booker last year 27/4/7 on 62% TS, missed the play-in by half a game, and received 3 All-NBA third-team votes.   Russ was the 3rd team guard also finishing ahead of him was Beal, Lowry, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, and Kemba Walker. Booker finished 12th in guard voting.  This year he finished 10th.  Just seems like goal posts shifting to me."
Devin Booker scored more in a game than your entire team will tonight
Funnily enough that same exact thing has been said about Devin Booker and Trae Young.
"Notable guys on Winning Teams that didn’t make the cut:  James Harden (lol)  Donovan Mitchell (literally averaged 26 and led the 1 seed)  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Russell Westbrook  Trae Young  Anthony Davis  Ben Simmons/Tobias Harris (can these guys be combined into one elite first team player instead)  Jaylen Brown   Pretty ridiculous omissions especially Donovan Mitchell. James Harden would’ve definitely made it on if he didn’t get injured, maybe he’d have replaced Beal"
"Suns not winning COTY or getting Mikal on an all defensive team is dumb, but whatever. Devin Booker not making an all-nba team is fucking braindead.  The lazy fucks in the NBA media don’t want to watch a wcf team who had the second best record in the NBA all year, and then when the success is undeniable, they want to assign all of it to CP3. That’s just blatantly wrong if you watch any of our games, no matter how good CP3 has been... the first round more than proved that."
"All-NBA 4th team:  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Kevin Durant  I guess Russ on the 5th team? Damn, so many good guards"
These guys grew up in Serbia in the 90s I don't think they're afraid of Devin Booker. I'm also willing to bet there have been multiple times they were down to throw hands to defend their fat little brother.
If Devin Booker gave a fan free shit or something in support of him fighting in the stands.
I think Jerry would be like a modern day Devin Booker but more physical
My bad let me correct it  Who SHOULD win it : Devin Armani Booker
"You're picking and choosing the information that YOU want to pick.  Devin Booker is 6'5 according to the NBA listing. You agree that's accurate. Tatum is 6'8"".  But apparently that's not accurate.  I can just as easily say to you that Booker looks 6'6"", therefore he is 6'6"" inches.  [Here's](https://www.nba.com/celtics/roster) the official Celtics roster.  Why in the world they undersell the height of their own player?  You said Tatum is 6'10, then you changed it to 6'9"".  You're just picking the number that you want, yet you refute the actual evidence."
Just @ Devin Booker next time buddy.
Devin Booker has averaged 25ppg this past 4 seasons. 2020 is the only season Tatum has ever averaged 25ppg so how is my last statement stupid
"Why is Devin Booker above Chris Paul... media loves Paul, he always gets 95% of the credit"
"i'm not offended, just think it's hilarious how dumb you are. I'd understand if you don't comprehend the difference.  I'm not fat or old and actually only fighting I've ever done is Muay Thai but solid effort from you. Why are people so hesitant to admit they were wrong? like you honestly think soft ass devin booker would beat up trained fighters that are considerably bigger than him?"
"yes, the elite professional athlete, who is known for his toughness as much as devin booker lol. are you going to address the part where the guys are bigger and know how to fight or just admit you were wrong and move on?  the latter would save you some time and make you look less dumb   edit: just looked at your comments and you're into professional wrestling LMAO. no wonder you think fighting is like a soap opera for men wherever who is the most popular wins."
"oh he's a professional athlete he must be good at fighting, that worked out well for nate robinson....   this is such a clown comment, jocik's brothers are way bigger, fight amateur mma, and would destroy devin 'amani' booker"
O so what devin booker is a superstar now? Thats news to me
"Devin Booker scored .85 points per isolation, Tatum .82.  Neither of those numbers are particularly good."
"Right so unless he outright says “I’m gone” I’m going try to make every trade and every adjustment I can to make him happy, if he comes out and is makes it clear he’s done then I ask for the biggest trade in history and try to poach a Zion or Devin Booker"
"worst case scenario, even if 29 other fanbases hate him for sticking up for one of his fans, people are gonna start hate-watching the suns. devin booker isn't a household name yet... and i think this is one of those situations where even bad pr is good pr... it'll get fans and the media talking about him and watching their games"
"Devin Armani Booker will avenge Mitchell’s ankles, should the Jazz lose this series."
"Not cocky, I'm confident, my bitch say I'm a narcissist .40 shoot, get hot like Devin Booker, ain't no guarding this"
"""~~Wheaties~~ Violence, the breakfast of Champions"" - Devin Booker"
Devin Booker is a dweeb who clearly can't tell who starts fights.
"I realize everyone is focused on Devin Booker getting involved here, but I wouldn't be surprised if Suns fan is getting DMs from Dana White right now"
The Nuggets fan should be in Shaqtin' for throwing those sucker punches and then having Devin Booker stick up for him because he had his ass deservingly whupped.
"Devin Booker tweets ""Need mans info"" with picture of the guy that yelled ""Suns in 4"" and punched couple Nuggets fans at the game 3 of the Suns-Nuggets series.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA74qktCGdk&amp;list=UUpR-yJ1a-SKhm0gWqNkCo9A&amp;index=4"
"Wtf, I didn’t even notice that. How are voters/the nba gonna say he’s a guard when he starts alongside Chris Paul and Devin Booker? These people are fucking dumb."
What am I reading? Klay Thompson averages only 3ppg less over his career but is much more efficient and plays better defence than Devin could dream of. Steph is an underrated defender but a Booker/Steph back court would be a defensively liability. Klay’s ability to give u an efficient 20ppg without needing the ball and play both ends at an elite levels meshes with Curry way better than D book would.
"*""I'm a pacifist...I'll pass a fist in your face""*  -Devin Booker"
"""Eye test is a thing""  I've watched Thybulle absolutely son the likes of Kemba Walker, Zach LaVine, Devin Booker, and DeAaron Fox"
Today Devin Booker chose violence
Every season before this year “devin booker wants out of phoenix” “NBA’s worst kept secret: devin booker wants a trade”
"*""Violence is never the answer, but sometimes it is.""*  -Devin Booker"
Devin Booker was never an empty stats player.
I’m a casual for thinking that Devin Booker was going to be better than Gary Harris??? Bruh… shut your fucking mouth there’s shit coming out of it
Devin Booker.
Devin Booker had an off year statistically this year while Zach Lavine had a career year. Zach Lavine was better this year but we shall see if he will regress to mean or if this is the new Zach Lavine. Devin Booker has played better this playoffs than he has all season.
"Bill Simmons also said:  &gt;When I say that I thought Devin Booker should have played Team USA, why am I saying that? Am I saying that to be a dick? Am I saying that to take a drive-by shot at him? No. I’m saying it because I think he’s really talented. And here’s his career so far: he played at the University of Kentucky for one year and they made the Final Four. That was the most important games he’s ever played in because he goes to Phoenix and he’s on lottery teams for four years. They won 17 games last year. He’s never played in a meaningful professional basketball game in his life. And I find it hard to believe that it wouldn’t make him better to play on Team USA and to have (Gregg) Popovich and Steve Kerr and all these coaches … the highlights of his career have been these meaningless scoring explosions.  Up to that point, how was any of this wrong? There's no pressure being on a bad team. Steph had an all time great season, arguably as good if not better than his unanimous MVP year, and caught 5 first place MVP votes. Why? Cuz his team didn't win.  I can't even find a source for the Bomani take and Nate Duncan is an idiot. But also like who gives a fuck, the people peddling these quotes to me are more annoying than these media people saying shit takes."
Ayton is very good. He’s the reason they got past the Lakers and nuggets. He plays defense and he’s mobile . Legit 7 footer too. I would always draft him over luka ESPECIALLY if I have devin booker
Devin booker best player on the team and nobody cares lol
"A lot of advanced analytics say Devin Booker is the #1 scorer on his team but the 4th best overall player. If you have Luka as the scorer, you don't need Booker."
How the fuck is Devin booker gonna call shit like that after what he did to Schroder?
Well Devin Booker isn't arguably the greatest boxer who has ever lived so that's kind of different.
Devin Booker
his mom and sister.  both wearing Devin Booker game-worn jerseys.  Nice.
Hates Jaylen? I think he's in a pretty good tier. He's in the same tier as Paul George and Ben Simmons which seems more than fair IMO. Jaylen is great but you think he's on the same tier as Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker? I don't think he's quite there.
"&gt;he immediately went after Devin Booker   No he didn't. He was going to go talk to the ref, but Booker righteously came in and gave him a slight shove. That's when Jokic became confrontational"
WAIT HOLD THE PHONE ARENT YOU THE GUY WHO ARGUED WITH ME THAT GARY HARRIS CONTRIBUTES MORE TO WINNING BASKETBALL THAN DEVIN BOOKER LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nobody has EVER said Roco is better than Devin Booker. At no time period were they ever even in the same tier
"I want to like Devin Booker, but I can’t for some reason. I can’t figure it out."
"If the Jazz make the wcf, it would be such a good matchup.  Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker Gobert vs Ayton Conley vs Paul  Then a crapton of young talent to follow that. What a good series it would be"
Suns fans and getting righteous with CP3 and devin booker on the team 🙄

"I feel like if Paul gets this team to the finals, Devin Booker might just take over. He definitely has that mamba mentality"
"&gt; Devin Booker ON and Chris Paul ON +34 in 145 minutes (60%) &gt;  &gt; Devin Booker OFF and Chris Paul ON -37 in 40 minutes (17%) &gt;  &gt; Devin Booker ON and Chris Paul OFF -7 in 50 minutes (21%) &gt;  &gt; Devin Booker OFF and Chris Paul OFF +3 in 5 minutes (2%)   The moral of the story is that if you're going to take off one, take off both. /s"
"Yes, because Devin Booker is the Suns' best player.  But also, this team is a two-headed snake and they don't really win without both of them being good. Chris Paul has been incredible and insanely valuable for us, it just sucks that he's gotten all the credit."
Neither did Devin Booker before this year
You can already see the nba world’s narratives shaping up. If the Suns lose its because CP3 choked and failed in the playoffs yet again while Devin Booker will be guy who comes out unscathed cause everyone’s like “he’s young and he was trying so hard!”
Yeah it’s such a shame Devin Booker has been fouling out every game… oh wait
"Well Curry and Kobe have as many 40 point finals games combined as Devin Booker has in the last two finals games, so that’s where that comes from.   Lebron played in 55 finals games and scored 40+ 8 times, Jordan played in 35 finals games and scored 40+ 6 times."
"You missed the independent part. If there was a conspiracy to extend series for the sake of advertisment dollars, then they would hardly grade the refs poorly for doing the job they wanted done would they? All conjecture and there could never be any tangible proof....but the fact that there is so much distrust in Adam Silver says a lot. Now time for a homer take....Devin Booker game 4 Finals. He had a couple soft ass fouls when he got a hot hand in the 3rs quarter, the same way he got a hot hand and buried teams in previous series, and had to sat....only to have a very obvious foul ignored late in the game. Why? Because it was close and a close game with All-Stars battling it out in the final minutes of the 4th quarter is good for ratings. Again i can't prove anything other than there was some ticky tack fouls called on Booker, and one major foul completely ignored. Inconsistent"
Devin Booker also dont even have 80% of the talent Larry Bird had
Bringing up Giannis on a post about Devin Booker’s performance doesn’t change the fact that Devin Booker has a higher Finals ppg than any player in celtic’s history.
That’s because Devin Booker is (and has been) our best player
"I'm not talking about what was or wasn't part of his game, I'm talking about player tendencies because I'm comparing and contrasting players. At the end of the day, besides slight differences and development of skills..Kobe, Diana, and Devin are similarly styled players. (And if you haven't watched Taurasi to know this..go look at highlights of her in her prime. It's clear as day)  My point is that Devin is actually more similar to Taurasi than he is Kobe. Gonna be real, we're talking about my two all time favorite players in Bryant and Taurasi - and there is no attempt here to slight either of them. Again, stop with this ""go watch"" shit. I watched them both for twenty years.  Early in his career Kobe used his athleticism more than his strength to score.  Early in Booker's career - like Taurasi - he uses his strength and quick bursts of speed more often than total athleticism.  It's not that Devin isn't athletic (Taurasi actually isn't), it's not that Kobe isn't strong. Kobe is one of the most skilled basketball players of all time, there wasn't much he didn't do - but there were things (especially in different time periods) he favored. (Just like there are things Devin favors) - Also, I'm not saying that Devin is stronger than Kobe. They're both strong two guards. It's about tendencies.  Again it's a slight difference. Highlights of all three show very similar players..but there are tendency differences. (IE, Taurasi is much more likely to pass, followed by Booker, followed by Bryant) I'm just saying..when you compare Taurasi and Bryant..what you find is Booker's tendencies align more with Taurasi's than they do Bryant's. (As does his on court personality)  Which again - makes sense - given she is the basketball player that he most credits with his evolution."
&gt; A dude irl at work literally told me to my face that Devin Booker will be the first 2k player to get above 90 ovr and that Giannis was 73 overall before the playoffs started. He also said Curry averages 60 in the playoffs.  I don’t even know what to say to this.
Devin booker. Hes been on two 10-70 teams why is he good again.
"CP3 is absolutely the answer and its not even hate. He's gotten literally all the praise for the Suns success and none of the blame for failures until now. They tried to push a ridiculous out of nowhere CP3 MVP narrative just to discredit Jokic, and his ""leadership"" was apparently the reason they won every playoff series, not a great team playing great team ball. Devin Booker was an All Star due to injury replacement while CP3 was a reserve. Its ridiculous."
"Putting my take out there as Devin Booker. Not great yet defensively and has put up some real inefficient games in this postseason. He's a -7 in the finals and was a -17 in the LAC series aside from game 6 which CP3 dominated. I legitimately think Ayton and CP3 have both been more important than him in the WCF and Finals.  Still a really good player and will probably eventually be an elite player, but I think we've elevated him past what he really is."
"Devin Booker was literally an ""empty stats""(which doesn't really make sense) guy until Chris Paul came along. I don't know how you said he has an impact on the game but not Bradley Beal."
No one is talking about Paul George. We're talking about perpetual crybaby Devin Booker and his excellent tackling form.
Exactly. Chris Paul went from beat PG of the past decade and Devin Booker went from Kobe Bryant 2.0 to now they ain't making a finals ever again.
"It's not Devin Booker's fault they gave him his 2nd and 3rd fouls on ticky tack plays, then come the fourth, Booker on fire, has to sit, Refs realize oh shit Booker missed too much of the fourth and then try to bail him?  Can't be having that.  I don't care who the stars are, stop letting stars get away with shit.  Giannis can just run at someone full speed and every 3 times it's a foul?    I don't care who ya wanna root for but the NBA's star power jerkfest is on full display this entire playoffs."
Do you think the suns would be worse if they have Bradley Beal instead of devin booker?

Devin Booker  Jordan Clarkson Ben Simmons Blake Griffin  James Harden  Tristan Thompson Kris Humphries  You can fill the rest ;)
"Early in his career, Kobe was much more likely to use speed and athleticism than strength. Devin is early in his career.   I don’t need to “go watch” anything, I watched Kobe his whole career. Easily the most skilled player I personally have ever watched and one of my all time favorites. Tendencies and abilities are different.   Another big difference is Kobe is like CP3 in that he’s methodical as a player, whereas Taurasi and  Booker are at their best in a fast paced game.  One thing though, Booker is clearly special. You can’t watch what he did this playoffs and think otherwise."
Now  1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Devin Booker  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. Jamal Murray  6. De’Aaron Fox  7. Ja Morant  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander     Ceiling  1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3.

"Devin Booker can certainly act. So can James Harden.  Khris Middleton, on the other hand, hams it up terribly."
James Khristian Middleton is playing better games of basketball relative to his oppositions Christopher Emmanuel Paul and Devin Armani Booker in the last quarters of this series which is the 4th quarter but Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo is unchangedly very transparent to see to be the best player of this series of basketball games which is the finals of the 2021 NBA season.
 Devin Booker
just like Devin Booker does on 90% of his drives?   there isn't a star in this league that doesn't get away with shit lol
"Its stupid, but imma keep riding the hate train and say these comments get me irrationally riled up. This isn't an r/nba specific issue, all of the internet does this and in real life too.  A dude irl at work literally told me to my face that Devin Booker will be the first 2k player to get above 90 ovr and that Giannis was 73 overall before the playoffs started. He also said Curry averages 60 in the playoffs. People say stupid shit for attention and/or to look smart. I hate when people conveniently blame specific parts of the internet to be the problem when the problem is simply people are bad/annoying/dumb. People do it with Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc. I'm not saying those platforms haven't been thr cause of some bad stuff, but they aren't the cause and origin of every bad thing."
"They are definitely good enough. They got to the 2nd round with Austin Rivers, an undrafted 30yr old rookie, newly aquired Aaron Gordon, young MPJ, and Jokic. Bench was diminished due to Will Barton &amp; Dozier also being hurt. Take Devin Booker off the Suns, and have them play a Nuggets team with Murray. Probably be a sweep as well. Nuggets way overachieved for what they had."
Devin Booker.  On multiple occasions NBA players voted for him/ picked him more favorably than fans did.
https://www.nba.com/news/devin-booker-nba-cares-community-assist-award-2021   He seems like a really good dude. But this sub is full of comments saying he seems like an entitled guy with a punchable face all the time.
Devin Booker. The Kobe comparisons are too much
"I'm being a bit more generous because there's a lot of stars that I think ***can*** lead their team to a title, but just haven't yet.  I think after this year, Giannis would be considered a star who has the potential to lead a team to a title (even if the Bucks lose 3-4). One could also argue that guys like Devin Booker and Trae Young also showed the ability to be a #1 option on a title contender.  So my list would be like Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis...but also guys who could be #1 options on a title-contender, but are currently on teams with weaker or flawed supporting casts (e.g., Luka, Dame, Embiid).  I also wonder if Donovan Mitchell and Nikola Jokic are close to that level as well (the Nuggets did lose Murray which stunted their playoff potential this year). There's also James Harden - who has made the WCF a few times but was stopped by the Warriors dynasty  Then there's guys like Jayson Tatum, who shows a ton of promise and potential - that's a future superstar IMO  Sorry - geeked out a bit. But you can see how the list quickly expands in my mind"
bruh Devin Booker is a low to mid tier all star player who's arguably not even the best player on his own team. To say he's gonna win  MVP is absurd.
ESPN: Does Devin Booker think he's better than Kobe Bryant?
Devin Booker: *EXPOSED*
"the way devin booker plays basketball is so cringe  it's sports, I'm allowed to shit talk a little, it ain't that serious lol"
"Well maybe prime Devin Booker will be capable of dropping 3, 40 point games in a row in the finals, guess we will see   Hopefully prime Devin Booker also doesn’t get benched for being bad in an nba finals, that’d help"
Gettin that OG Devin Booker treatment
"* Luka Doncic * Devin Booker * SGA * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Trae Young * Ja Morant * De'Aaron Fox  Anyone who doesn't put Luka #1 is on crack. SGA's length makes me love him for the defensive aspect of his game more than a few others, even if they're a bit better scorers. It's crazy how Fox is last cuz I think he's also great."
"It's a let down for sure, it sucks more for Devin Booker than anyone. But I just hate that coming up short automatically correlates to saying someone didn't work hard enough.  Every all-time great came up short in their career before and came out the other side better for it.  Whether it be Kobe's airballs, Jordan coming up short against the Pistons, LeBron coming up small against Dallas, Gianiss coming up small against ""the Wall"" it happens especially during a young players first run to the finals."
"Ah editing your original comment because you looked stupid now are we?   Also Booker doesn't get hit every play my guy I'm sorry. Look at the way Giannis plays and look at the way Booker plays, do you really think Devin fucking Booker deserves more calls? Give me a break."
I think you mean trae young not devin booker
"&gt;inform me on how someone going to an Internet forum to hypocritically complain about the fact that someone complains is equal to legitimate criticism of Devin Booker.  It's pretty reductive to call someone a hypocrite for criticizing someone for complaining too much.  How would anyone ever know they are complaining too much if the only way to inform them is to ""hypocritically complain about the fact that someone complains""?  My point is that Booker is the beneficiary of the whistle (or lack thereof) more often than not. Sometimes rightly so. Oftentimes not rightly so. I personally find his complaining distasteful when I compare it to other players who have been treated less fairly but complain less. That's my opinion based on what I have seen. I don't know what other factors are involved as I am just a fan watching the game from afar, so I definitely wouldn't characterize this as a legitimate criticism. It's just my opinion, which I offered as a reason for why I (and potentially others) ""hate"" on him. Feel free to disagree. There are literally no consequences here."
"It would’ve made Booker learn to play off-ball, because you aren’t taking the ball out of Luka’s hands for devin Booker lol. Would’ve been better for Bookers development long term, because he can’t be your primary ball handler with his level of playmaking. If he embraced that role of cutting, running around screens for 3s and midrange/drives it would’ve worked."
"Maybe I'm just old enough to remember when they were stars, especially Hill. But I don't find them hard to tell apart, at all.   To me this is like comparing Devin Booker and Ben Simmons. Or Giannis and Russell Westbrook."

"&gt;MTO I have some tea for you. Devin Booker has a massive d*ck. I mean massive, I’ve never seen anything like it. We met a few months ago when he was in my DMs and we finally connected when he came to [NAME OF CITY REDACTED] &gt; &gt;He warned me that he was big before we got back to his room, but I had no idea. The thing is 14 inches and as thick as a poland spring. &gt; &gt;We tried to put it in, but it couldn’t fit. Not in my mouth, not in my p*ssy nowhere. I felt bad so I ended up [using her hand]. He seemed embarrassed by the size of it. Normally I would say a big d*ck is a blessing. But in his case, I think it’s a curse.

Because he’s not talking about Basketball; he’s talking about * Basketball narratives*. Devin Booker has not had a similar career to Kobe so far. It’s all hot air and white noise.
"One video of him complaining a double team in an offseason workout years ago is ""Devin Booker openly admitting he doesn't practice beating double teams"" ? Him being very effective against double teams this entire season now means nothing because he got stripped by arguably the best perimeter defender in the NBA right now?  Literally every star player in history of basketball has turned the ball over when double teamed.  No Devin Booker is not an All-Time Great at the moment, he's not supposed to even be in the conversation, but it's not because he doesn't put the work in. He would not be in the NBA Finals dropping 40 point games if he just didn't put the work in.  He's improved almost every season of his career this is just asinine to say he doesn't have what it takes mentality wise to be an all time great as if anyone of us knows shit about what it takes to do that or to not do it.  There was a point and time where Michael Jordan didn't enjoy weight training, that doesn't mean he lacked the mentality to be great.  You can't define Devin Booker's work habits with a 30-second video from years ago bruh. You just can't it's asinine to judge anyone in that manner let alone an elite athlete."
y’all are adding so much pressure to this young man by comparing him to kobe bryant.   i’m sure he doesn’t want to be kobe. he wants to be devin booker.
In kobe first finals Kobe played worse than Devin booker. Kobe didnt score 40 points and booker did. Plus kobe had shaq and was still shooting airballs. Im not saying devin is better than kobe. But devins first finals&gt; kobe first finals
"SAS: “How dare Devin Booker use his name and Kobe’s in the same sentence!? How dare he?”  Max: “Hold on, I think that just might be an apt comparison!”  Some lady from the rotating cast of ESPN anchors: “Guys, we gotta take a break, still to come… news on LeBron, Steph Curry, and all the rest in the league… right after this break!”"
"*A lot of people*? Can you give me more than one actual example of people saying that Devin Booker is better than Kobe Bryant? No one is actually saying that at this point in his career. Book is a great player, but 99/100 people aren’t going to try to actually argue he’s a better player"
Smith just needs to let Booker be Booker. No need to put that kind of pressure on Devin.
"Well the result is from the act it’s like when Jordan stripped Malone the strip is not all that impressive, but it’s the whole play. Devin Booker drives he is doubled he turns out to look for the pass and instantly is ripped saying he couldn’t handle the double is dumb. Jrue Holiday made the play and that’s that give the defense the props he risked it all for that play. He leaves CP3 wide open to try and make that play."
"There is a basically a 0% chance of that.  If the Suns come back to win, Devin Booker is the likely MVP."
Giannis and Bucks good guys   Devin Booker and Suns bad guys     Cade Cunningham will lead the Pistons to 7 rings
Let's stop with the revisionist history. The Nuggets Fan clearly was in the wrong when he poured a drink over the suns fan and then sucker punched him. The fact that the suns fan still got the better of him is just karma. As fans we can't complain about the league being soft when we have fans calling out Devin Booker for just buying the suns fan tickets...
"where the fuck does all this hate come from from randos on this sub? these are the bucks and the suns, how do you guys hate anyone on either of these teams right now? devin booker has been in like 5 important games in his life. were one of those a real heartbreaker for the knicks that i missed?"
"I think Giannis has officially ascended to super-star level. With a good supporting cast and great chemistry, the results speak for themselves. For the Suns, you have an ATG in CP3 and a perpetual All-Star in Devin Booker, but the gap is clear. There are levels to this, and fortunately for the Bucks, they seemed to have matured into it while the Suns are maybe a post-season or two behind.   Note, I’m not saying that the two latter players are not or cannot be that, but at the current timing, they simply are not."

"i can't say im neutral cause I wanna see the suns win, but you can't bring up the Chris Paul foul as if it was the only extremely dangerous play when earlier in the game Giannis did the exact same thing to Devin Booker"
"I'm rooting for the Bucks to win, but its funny you see only how Booker/CP3 is dirty and nothing on Giannis' dirty ass tackle on Devin Booker in the first Q when Booker had an open dunk in transition"
"In the NBA Finals, in 195 minutes with Devin Booker on the floor, the Suns have a 6.3 Net Rating.  In the 45 minutes he's sat, it's a -38.0 Net Rating.  People who even think about blaming Booker don't deserve to have opinions."
"Moses had the quickest re-jumpability of any big ever. He really should be the only guy with a pogo stick badge in 2K. He relied on his jumping and incredible reaction time. Artis was a bear. No one ine NBA history could hold their position in the post better than Artis. His frame was massive and he has the best stiff arm in basketball   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf6ABWKQ65w  Everyone remembers Wilt sonning Shaq with that handshake at the All-Star Game, but no one remembers Artis shoving Kareem 10 feet out of the post with one hand lol. Artis LOVED overpowering Kareem     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1GJ5wxyTc  Here's a close battle on the stat sheet between Artis &amp; Gilmore, that REALLY shows their games off. Artis bulls around getting wherever he wants and moves anyone he wants to move. Moses is relentless and indefatigable, and he reacts faster than everyone  &amp;#x200B;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oJrIFViCeo  &amp;#x200B;  Artis vs. Moses head to head is crazy because they had almost the exact same stat averages in their games against each other:     https://stathead.com/tiny/29JLD     Artis was much older than Moses so we should throw out Artis' final few seasons dragging down the averages. Artis outplayed Moses head to head     I think Sam Jones is the most forgotten and underrated legend we have. No one ever talks about Sam Jones, and how he was the Devin Booker or the Kobe or the Wade of the 60s Celtics. He gets no credit, no retrospectives, no mentions, just nothing. Artis is my second most underrated. He had Wilt's frame with more mass, just an immovable object badass who would NOT be forgotten if he played today. People would love his fro and his hammer dunks and his feats of strength."
Context is that Devin Booker has an identical shot chart.
If Devin Booker was that sore of a loser he would not currently be a Phoenix Sun 😂
"While I agree Giannis also shoved Booker earlier in the game, and something they look for in flagrants is result of them. I do think Chris Paul’s was pretty dangerous but so was Giannis’s on Devin Booker. I’m not gonna bother trying to go more in depth but I think if you asses a flagrant to CP3 and not Giannis it just puts more questions onto the game"
"Aside from the obvious 23…  0 gives you Lillard/DiVincenzo/Miles Bridges/Tatum/Love. D’lo is also there but that defence is already pretty rough so I’d have him off the bench to slaughter worse lineups with DiVincenzo starting.  00 could give you Lonnie Walker/Devin Booker/Anthony Edwards/Zion. Centre sucks, it’d be Mike Scott by default but Zion might actually be the best option there, but you’ve got guys like Malik Monk and TJ Warren and Bruce Brown to fill in the gaps."
Devin Booker is more like Andrew Toney
"it's that devin booker move where if you cry about it enough, it'll go your way at least one time."
"Victim mentality is a scary thing, but so is the Devin Booker circle jerk they have going on."
"&gt; Or if the Suns win, are there stronger candidates on their roster?  Devin Booker just had back-to-back 40 point games."
Trust me tho I know what Devin Booker is thinking  He’s struggling with the moment does he really have the mental fortitude???
"Lmao, “Melo is objectively handsome.” I just find it funny that this topic has to be discussed just to understand how the refs come up with their calls, because at this point anybodies guess is good.   Haha, imagine the refs at the scoring table after reviewing a flagrant foul against Kris Middleton: “common foul, Kris Middleton is not as cute as Devin Booker. “"
"I genuinely am sick of this sub sometimes, even though it’s one of my favorites. I started venturing to the baseball sub since MLB The Show‘s Diamond Dynasty rewards following the season. I honestly prefer it when it comes to reactions, discussion, and takes in general. I genuinely learn stuff about the sport and even things that seem controversial aren’t met with mass downvoting and other bullshit. If I were casually into basketball, I’d come in here with absolutely zero bearing on the league landscape on a daily basis.   Baseball still has funny memes and typical Reddit stuff, but it’s not anything near as overwhelming as it is here on an hourly basis.   If the Suns win next game, we’ll be rid of the “Devin Booker sucks lol.” Then the Bucks will win and we’ll get “Lol to everyone who thought Devin Booker was good”   Exhausting bullshit"
Lol Giannis did the same thing to Devin booker
devin booker reminds me of the walmart version of this player i watched named kobe bryant
"2011 Mavs beat Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Dwade, and bosh. Giannis beat a nets team without Kyrie, a crippled harden, trae young, and Chris Paul/Devin Booker they can’t be compared"
"&gt; Is old kobe better than young kobe in terms of playstyle (disregarding stats)?  Obviously his game changed a tiny bit as his athleticism declined, but sadly, not that much. He continued gunning and just shot absolutely atrocious efficiency once his body couldn't keep up.   If you look at 3p% as a measure of his range, there's not really a sign of that increasing as he ages. And if you look at AST%, that basically hovered in the mid 20s basically his whole career (omitting the first and last 3 years of his career).   &gt; Is old kobe better than young kobe in terms of playstyle (disregarding stats)? Same animal, different beast.  I don't think so. He relied less on dunks but that's about it ('03 was probably his last good dunking year). He could still get free throws though and I think drawing fouls while shooting jump shots is absolutely a skill. Devin Booker isn't nearly as good as Kobe at that (Kobe only had 5 seasons with a lower FTA/100 rate than Booker's current season, all at the book ends of his career)."
"When the Bucks got Portis, Holiday, Lopez, Middleton, and Giannis on the court, just wrap it up, the Suns can’t keep up with that, regardless of how much effort Devin Booker puts"
"The Suns' entire offense runs through Chris Paul. Restrict CP3's game and you've basically shut down the Suns. Devin Booker's great the last few games, but they're not going to win a title relying on Booker isos."
i mean what more do you need to know other than *Devin Booker* did not even argue the call??
well what does it tell you that *Devin Booker* did not even complain about the call during the biggest moment of the game? i think it's a lot cleaner of a strip than you think. contacting hand/wrist area does not mean an automatic foul. that kind of contact is almost always going to happen in a strip like that.
"No discredit to Giannis, but his finals run also has been a lot less difficult than Dirk's '11 run. At the end of the day a championship is a championship, and you can only play who is in front of you, but Dirk's '11 run was super impressive because of the players/teams he took down along the way.  Round 1: Portland v Miami, IMO it's pretty even, that Blazers team was very good, but if you argued '21 Miami was better I wouldn't complain  Round 2: Lakers v Nets, on paper this is close, until you realize the Nets were riddled with injuries, and the Lakers were the 2x defending champions who just easily won their first round matchup. This one IMO definitely goes to the Lakers as they weren't injured.   Round 3: OKC v Atlanta, two young teams that no one expected to get this far. That being said I think OKC was a better team.  Finals: Miami v Phoenix, One team had peak LeBron, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, the other has Devin Booker and 36 year old Chris Paul."
"In game 5, the Suns had an offensive rating of over 130 when Booker played and were +12 in his minutes. If your takeaway from last night was that Devin Booker was the problem, I don’t know anymore."
"I give Jrue a pass on shooting cause his defense. I run about 5 miles a day 5x a week and I workout and whatever, but when I play defense for a few pick up games my legs get spent. I can knock down threes all day normally but playing good defense tires me out so much that my shot starts to suck after a while. I'm chasing dudes at LA fitness not Chris Paul and Devin Booker lol so I have made respect for Jrue forreal"
"I mean, come on, Devin Booker just did this thing when he isolated outside the paint, made a few quick low pump fakes, and then shot a fadeaway. ""Is that you, Kobe?"", I asked."
Devin Booker is humble af
"There always ends up being a good guy vs bad guy dynamic, a la pro wrestling and we all fall for it.   Over the course of these playoffs, Booker  went from:  “MY BOY D BOOK DONT FLOP CUZ HE AINT NO BITCH!”  To   “God Devin Booker is such a bitch.”"
"Our ball movement stopped in the second half, it’s not like Booker stopped it. If anything, CP3 dribbling so much in the third is the reason it stopped and the Bucks went on a run. That’s also a credit to the Buck’s defense. Devin Booker then went and scored 11 points efficiently in a stalled offense.  We aren’t even in that spot if it wasn’t for DBook hitting an insane 3 to put us down 1 just before that."
KEEP THAT SAME ENERGY FOR WHEN GIANNIS TRIED TO DO IT TO DEVIN BOOKER MOTHER FUCKER KEEP THAT SAME ENERGY PUSSYHOLE
Hmmm where's all the hate for giannis and all this talk about wanting to be the villain so bad for staring and flexing after a dunk??? Oh right he ain't named devin booker I forgot
Arguably the “fix” was making sure superstar Devin Booker stays on the court to make for a more entertaining/exciting finish to Game 4.
"I'm still wondering if they would have called Devin Booker for the blatant violation on Middleton's second free throw at the end if he had missed it, when Booker ran in from the 3pt line and was basically next to Middleton as he released the ball.  Given the whistle Booker has gotten, and the fact that they haven't called that on any of Giannis' missed free throws when they do it (though none of them as blatant as this one, and Middleton doesn't have the same delay before his release as Giannis), I honestly don't know."
"If that player becomes Devin Booker it's absolutely worth it. If that player is Dennis Smith Jr., it isn't."
I can tell you've never watched Jalen Green in your life. He's actually a average to above average man on man defender. And Devin Booker made the finals at 24 and scored 70 points in a game. I wouldn't judge him yet.
"he ripped that ball out of his hands, devin booker was surprised to turn around and see jrue in his face  whats up kid, gimmie that rock.    gimmie that ring!  its mine!    chris paul's reaction on the other end too was hilarious, once he saw jrue throw the lob up he's like OH FUCK and turns around and just does the only thing he can and desperately shoves the shit out of giannis.. like noooo its my ring nooooooo give it to meee"
Devin booker is the real metapod
"Devin Booker. Giannis..Jokic, Luka."
The Devin Booker one doesn't even make sense.  His name isn't Devin Book.  It's Devin Booker.  He should be booking people into the county jail.
"trying to draw definitive conclusions from a high variance event like the 3 point contest is braindead. mediocre shooters can get hot, that doesn’t mean they’re the best shooters. case in point devin booker, he’s tied with steph at 25/30 but he is not a good 3 point shooter. but if that’s how you wanna make your evaluations then go for it"
oh so we’re making determinations from the 3 point shooting contest now. guess devin booker is one of the best 3 point shooters ever since he also has a 25/30
"Devin Booker stats in WCF:  Game 1: 40 points on 15/29,  Game 2: 20 points on 5/16,  Game 3: 15 points on 5/21,  Game 4: 25 points on 8/22,  Game 5: 31 points on 9/22,  Game 6: 22 points on 10/26,  He was locked up lol. The points total skip over the volume shooting by Booker"
"Yeah Luka is too large, not a good matchup for him. His work against Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker was phenomenal."
if devin booker put up 25 the rest of his career with minimal playoff success people would call him great too
"&gt;The two records I can’t see being broken is Derrick Rose being the youngest MVP in NBA history at age 22....Another one that probably won’t be broken for years is Devin Booker’s record for most total points in a players first playoff appearance with 601.  Those records will be broken soon IMHO because they were circumstantial records. Too many players now coming in the league at 19yrs old, for the DRose record to stand for long. And the Booker record for points is just not going to be that hard to break *---since it depends on an All-Star player being the #1 option on a team that makes it to the NBA Finals during his first time in the playoffs. That won't be so hard of a feat to repeat nowadays.*  **Records I see not being broken, are the ones that have stood for decades**. Such as  1961-'62 season when Wilt Chamberlain avg. 51ppg . Or the 1960-'61 season when Wilt avg. 27 rebounds per game ----then he did it again, the following season. I also think Mark Eaton's \[1984-'85\] record of nearly 6 blocks per game, may not be broken."
Steph Curry  Devin Booker  Luka Doncic  Klay Thompson  Kevin Garnett
Devin booker is keeping that record for life my guy
"You would think of another reason why it was so obvious. For example ""Alperen was undersized"" or ""Usman Garuba showed no offensive game"" etc. Rubio was also benched at some point and he turned out okay. Even Luka started on the bench until the player ahead of him got hurt. Devin Booker was benched in college and he turned out to be a good player. There are times, particularly in weak draft classes, where you have to depend on small sample sizes and seeing a vision of the future rather than getting perfect information."
"Justise Winslow. I always figured there was something there if we took him over Devin Booker, and he played good defense. Meanwhile Devin Booker got to the Finals, made several All Star and All NBA teams, and is known as a superstar. And Justise, got bit by the injury bug more than a couple times, never grew his game and eventually became a journeyman that is destined for vet min contracts and the bench. Between him and Beasley it's a toss up for Pat Riley's worst pick ever."
KG in the span of his career played against him and Devin Booker lol
A bunch of solid candidates for that 9th spot and then there's Devin Booker lol
"Gilbert Arenas is why I was skeptical of players like Devin Booker or Zach LaVine actually being franchise caliber players (until this last season) for most of their careers.  I watched Arenas drop 40 on guys quite a bit but it never translated in to success in the playoffs.   Guys like him are in *every* NBA generation, where they are a walking bucket but just do not get the wins despite their scoring prowess and I would argue this most recent generation's example of that is Melo, I'm curious who this upcoming generation's example will be."
D’Angelo Russell  Jordan Clarkson  Devin Booker  Kyle Kuzma  Blake Griffin
"Kyle Kuzma can ascend into a Top 30 player given he’s the first option of a team. Maybe if he gets redrafted to an expansion team and he’s the best player on that team, he’’d put up Devin Booker “empty stats” numbers"
Donovan Mitchell    Luka     Zion    KAT   Davion Mitchell   Embiid   Devin Booker
"They have a great gameplan for Giannis. Leave him wide open outside 20 feet and make life tougher for Middleton and Jrue who can beat you anywhere. It doesn't really matter when it's the most injured playoffs ever though including a Paul George vs Devin Booker Finals, weakest WCF in over 20 years.  You're working backwards because you don't understand basketball analysis and haven't even tried to learn it."
"Kawhi isn’t the athlete that young Jordan was but he plays like second three peat Jordan just slower, first three peat maybe Anthony Edwards  Devin Booker kinda plays like Kobe and Kobe was an MJ reskin just a little worse so maybe him as well"
Devin Booker should be added next!
Mitchell because I don't want him to cook the Clippers anymore. Devin Booker was so meh after we faced Mitchell and luka
aren't they? besides three point percentage they're nearly identical  |Player|G|GS|FG|FGA|FG|3P|3PA|3P|2P|2PA|2P|eFG|FT|FTA|FT|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Devin Booker|22|22|9.6|21.5|0.447|2|6.2|0.321|7.6|15.3|0.499|0.494|6|6.7|0.905|0.558|5.6|4.5|0.8|0.2|3.7|3.5|27.3| |Donovan Mitchell|33|33|9.9|22.6|0.436|3.6|9.2|0.394|6.3|13.5|0.465|0.516|5.5|6.4|0.862|0.567|5.1|4.6|1.3|0.3|3.3|2.5|28|

DLo is not and never has been even close to as good as Devin Booker.
"I think to close to guarantee you need a top 25 player who is preferably a scorer. I’m gonna say devin booker, Chris Paul, Westbrook, are players I feel comfortable with leasing a team to the final 4 no problem."
"If he was that good he’d be winning more. Even Devin Booker was sniffing the play in games before CP3 came to town. Same with Zion. Jokic had the nuggets competing for 8 seeds like 4 years ago. Other than his 1 year with Jimmy, KAT hasn’t shown he can lead a team to the playoffs."
Yada Yada Giannis isnt good on the perimeter (Please ignore him repeatedly shutting down Chris Paul and Devin Booker on the perimeter in the finals a month ago) yada yada
FVV was coming off the bench for 25-27MPG and played even less in the playoffs. We had Danny Green starting for most matchups that would give us issues defensively and also had Norm off the bench for 20MPG. This is without mentioning that both Lowry and FVV are dogs defensively.   Sexton is closer to Monta Ellis than he is to Devin Booker. If he was worth a max then the Cavs wouldn't be looking to trade him in the first place. He'd have to show something really promising in the upcoming season to be compared to Booker.
Because Devin Booker and Ayton are Kobe and Shaq 2.0?  Did you not see this sub during the finals? That’s all we kept hearing lol
Devin Booker scoring 70 vs the Celtics.   Klay thompson shooting 37 in a quarter   KD vs the Bucks (only needed an inch off his foot damn)
Harden if you incorporate getting the team involved.  Kobe if you talkin straight carry job.  Why use Harden when Devin Booker had a 70* points?
"As a Miami Heat fan, I would redo the 2008 NBA Draft. We had the 2nd overall pick and we picked Michael Beasley who became arguably the worst draft bust in Heat history.  We could have picked Russell Westbrook! Imagine him in the backcourt with a prime Dwyane Wade? Or we could have picked Danilo Gallinari if we really needed a PF.  Alternatively, we could have picked Devin Booker over Justise Winslow in the 2015 NBA Draft! We had the 10th overall pick."

"Putting Jokic or Giannis in KAT's position would've made them a consistent playoff team at the very least. No one is saying KAT is trash, he's an all-star/debatably all-nba caliber player. But ridiculous comparisons trying to equate him to mvps is what makes his fans so laughable. Unless he drastically changes into an elite playmaker like Jokic or a DPOY caliber player like Giannis, the pieces that must be put next to him to contend are very costly and rare. You can't be the best player on the team and receive no blame for the team's failures. Devin Booker increased his scoring efficiency, made more of an effort on defense and even acted as the main distributor on the team for two years before CP3 arrived. I'm yet to see KAT take a massive step out of his comfort zone for the sake of his team like that."
They call that the “Devin Booker” lmao

Call up Devin Booker to give him dating lessons ASAP
"I'd rather watch an aging Lebron over Jokic.  I'd rather watch a prime Giannis over Jokic  I'd rather watch the twilights of Curry and KD over Jokic.  That puts Jokic 5th.. and I haven't even mention Luka, Trae Young or Devin Booker."
"By the numbers (nba.com tracking stats), the five best midrange shooters last season (min. 3 attempts per game):  Kyrie Irving (54.4% on 3.8 attempts)  Chris Paul (51.6% on 5.5 attempts)  Nikola Jokic (51.5% on 3.3 attempts)  LaMarcus Aldridge (51.2% on 5.0 attempts)  Kevin Durant (50.6% on 5.1 attempts)  Honestly, that list makes a lot of sense— some other guys you'd expect to see were pretty close, like Devin Booker (48.6%) or  CJ McCollum (48.9%). Joel Embiid also had an incredible season from midrange last year (49.1% on 5.6 attempts, 5th most in the league), but the biggest surprise for me was that Kawhi only shot 44.7% from midrange— I always thought he was a low-50s kind of guy, but the nba.com numbers don't seem to back that up even in previous seasons.  ^(Surprising no one, the league leader in midrange volume this year was Russell Westbrook, who shot a blistering 38.1% on 6.1 attempts. He's #1 in shot attempts, but #11 in shots made.)"
"even that warriors team with two of the best 3 point shooters of all time needed to add KD the midrange assassin because they were running into trouble in the playoffs.     guys like kawhi, middleton, butler take their games up a level in the playoffs every year cause they have killer midrange games.   maybe not butler this most recent year but historically he has.  chris paul and devin booker firing elbow jumpers basically took the suns to the finals.    other teams know that shots at the rim and 3 pointers are the best shots so they spend all their time figuring out how to discourage those shots.   if you can just pull up from 10 feet and not have to worry about getting blocked by giannis or embiid or gobert it makes your life a lot easier.   even coming off the PNR you see a lot more people stop and shoot midranges than trying to take it all the way to the hoop in the playoffs, the paint defenders and schemes are just much harder at that level"
"Donovan is incredible. But to be called a *Superstar* you gotta be in a class of your own.  I'd say, LeBron, KD, Steph, Kawhi and Giannis are the superstars in the league.  I'd put Donovan with guys like Paul George and Devin Booker"
You’re actually using a guard that hasn’t made the all star team in the stacked ass western conference where Devin Booker has only made it once as a replacement as an example of being a bad thing?
"1. lead the league in assists and assist% on a lower usage rate than guys like Zach Lavine, De'Aron Fox, and Devin Booker 2. 8th point guard in scoring 3. 6th in rebounds, and one of two guys under 6'10"" in the top 20  you can't honestly look at those numbers and tell me there's 30 players in the league better than that. He's the 4th or 5th best pg in the game depending on where you put Harden. Some of yall are straight up on crack"
Not really. People just like watching fun teams with fun players. Steph Curry is more fun than Devin Booker and 37 year old CP3.
"Devin Booker is 24, Lillard is 31... one guy has a lot of time left and the other doesn't. I'm sorry, but they're not even close to being the same situations (assuming you're saying Booker should have requested a trade prior to CP3 joining the team)."
Devin Booker after this years playoffs
"He lowkey reminds me a lot of Devin Booker, his game, his shot, same size, even looks like him a little too"
Jaylen Brown or Devin Booker?
"Elusive 7th pick. 7th pick only works charm for the Warriors.  13th pick. Use this pick to draft a shooting guard and you have yourself an allstar at best. Kobe Bryant, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell and Chris Duarte"
I officially lost it when Stephen A said trade Kuzma for Devin Booker
"Imagine making the Finals, then losing CP3 and Devin Booker for Saddiq Bey and Spencer Dinwiddie"
Low key gives me some  Devin Booker vibes. Like discount rack
Suns have Devin Booker and Elfrid Payton (although Elfrid played like 1/3 of that season in Phoenix).
"I did unironically say that.    Devin Booker improved year after year, his defense went from miserable to acceptable, and he was otherwise showing the right skills for his position. KAT having bad defense is so much worse as a center.    If KAT improved half as much as Book did over the past few years he'd be All-NBA lock. He didn't. I hate hating on the guy, but the results are clear. If the Wolves hit the playoffs in the next five years, I expect it will be Ant leading."
"did you just unironically say you'd take clint capela over KAT?  you're aware that even just a year or two ago, devin booker, who just made the finals this year, was accused of the exact same shit as you said about KAT?   sometimes it's not the players fault, but rather their coaching &amp; situations, you can't just see everything as black or white"
Uhhhh the guy that went toe to toe with Devin Booker in the finals?
"Kristaps was seen as a massive reach at #4, turned out to be a great pick. The only guy drafted below him to outperform him is Devin Booker (pick #14)."
Devin Booker is a bad defender  Just watch his Olympic/playoff run and he’s average at worst
"Trae is undoubtedly better than Mitchell and Booker. He’s better than CP3 too. And there’s definitely an argument for him to be better than Kyrie.   Do you understand that Trae averaged 29 and 9 in his second season and 25 and 9 this season….  Those are amazing point guard numbers and he’s only 22 years old and he led his team to the ECF while beating the #1 seed and dropped 48 and 11 in game 1 against the bucks…   How tf are Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker better than him, Trae in his second season had numbers that they’ll probably never have. Trae already eclipsed anything kyrie did in Boston as the #1 option and this is coming from a guy who loves kyrie.   Tired of the Trae disrespect, he’s definitely a top 15 player in the league rn, right behind Paul George and Tatum"
"the concept of winning basketball is being used a myth perpetuated by people that don't understand that basketball is a team sport. Was Devin Booker a garbage player before CP3 came to Phoenix, or was he good and u just want an excuse to not pay attention to players on bad teams?  LeBron and Jordan both played on teams that were god awful for the first stretch of their careers, were they ""not playing winning basketball"""
"Suns, because fuck Devin Booker and CP3  Whatever team Kuzma is on now  And that's about it. I like LeBron so I never root against him and I want him to win a championship if my team doesn't win."
"Idk when I said Devin Booker is a more valuable/better player than Anthony Davis alot of people seemed to be really upset.  ""Every GM would take AD"" okay congrats lol. I wouldn't."
Devin “Ron “Faarooq” Simmons” Booker
Donovan Mitchell&gt;Devin Booker. Sometimes I get crucified for saying this
Neither are close to Butler defensively and Jimmy is an amazing slasher and better playmaker than the two  The man was putting up 40 point triple doubles on LeBron James in the finals last year. One bad playoff series does not bring him down  Also how the fuck is Devin Booker better than Paul George
"We got it y’all. Seen it before. Pulling up highlights from so long ago like oh my lebron is such a dirty player this is horrible. Please also link the Devin Booker push on Schroeder, CP3 full shove on Giannis, any other play that’s ever happened like man we got it this stuff happened why is it even relevant anymore?"
"Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown"
Devin Booker
Devin Booker: 3/24/17-3/24/17
"&gt; monk  As a Kentucky fan, Malik Monk was a better shooter than Jamal Murray and Devin Booker in college.  The talent is there, but I don't know where his head is.  I expected great things out of him when he went to Charlotte, but they barely used him.  The Lakers bench is soft and I can see Monk outshining the other shooters on the team."
"wow im shocked they got rid of Patrick Beverley, he was huge for the clips vs the suns, he was able to clamp down devin booker pretty well, Im expecting these teams to match up again in the playoffs next year, so it surprises me they get rid of him"
"Well, yeah. Cam Payne's in the NBA and Devin Booker plays for Fenerbahçe."
He shut down Devin Booker in the playoffs.
I think next season is going to be a good barometer for who the better player truly is. 2 years ago Devin Booker didn’t really have any significant shot creators on offense and so much of the burden fell on him for creation the way Lavine dealt with last season. This is the first shot we see at who is the best when they have help.
Devin Booker&gt;Jayson Tatum
Jaylen Brown &gt; Devin Booker
Zach Lavine &gt; Devin Booker. Zach does everything Booker does but is a better scorer inside and more athletic. Could have had the same success Booker did if their roles were switched and he was on the Suns this year.
There’s just no nuance when they discuss our players but it exists for other teams.  I’m sure you get it as a Suns fan since Devin Booker was an “empty stats guy” for years even though that’s not really true and it was unfair for people to dismiss the talent there.
I’m surprised about pat bev. He did good in this play off keeping devin booker scoring low
Jamal Murray &gt; Devin Booker
"Not sure if this qualifies but Tyler Herro. In the bubble I was seeing shades of Devin Booker, and then when I saw him this year he just didn’t look the same, even if his stats show some progression."
Yeah I don't think this sub can get over their Pat Bev hateboner to notice that he had Devin Booker shooting under 40% every game the only player Eric Bledsoe held under 40% fg was Giannis.
"Regular season awards mean next to nothing to me. We just saw the regular season DPOY get torched by Terrance mann, Giannis was a DPOY and they made him sit in the corner and guard Blake Griffin while KD scored 50. Beating 36 year old chris Paul and Devin booker is nothing compared to beating Steph curry, klay and dray."
I still think Tyler Herro has a Devin Booker potential. Just needs to get back on track and focusing on basketball.
"You just blamed a player for getting injured, Jesus Christ what are we doing here  Giannis beating 36 year old chris Paul and Devin booker is not even close to kawhi beating Steph, klay and Dray."
"Devin Booker, I like him a lot as a player, but he looks like he’ll cap out around the PG-13 range type of superstar. He can become as good as he wants on offense, but his extreme lack of defense is what’s gonna hold him back ultimately."
I honestly think SGA is better than Devin Booker. Everyone gets mad at me when I say it but I think Booker is at his peak and SGA is already as good as he is
Suns fans won’t like this one lol.   Jamal Murray &gt; Devin Booker
Donovan Mitchell &gt; Devin Booker
Zach lavine is on the level of devin Booker maybe even a better defender
Donovan Mitchell &gt; Devin Booker
"Devin Booker. Most of the people on /r/NBA think he's a whiney, cocky POS overrated player. I clearly think otherwise. He's already a superstar."
"""no one""  You're making an extremely obtuse argument based on watching 2 documentaries  Warriors Dynasty were full of talent, but known for being able to distribute properly  Toronto Raptors were lead by Kawhi, but revolved with the distribution of Lowry, FVV and Siakam  In the finals the Suns relied heavily on Devin Booker, but for the most part of the season they got all their guys involved which is what made them so deadly, Chris Paul, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, Payne  I would argue that the 2000s revolved way more around stars going out and scoring vs the era today which requires multiple shooters and mobile big men"
Because it was not a competitive game and they were literally fouling the other team in order to give Wilt more possessions so he could get to his 100.  Devin Booker had a 70 point game recently that was *very* similar with his Suns being on the losing end the entire time instead of winning the way Wilt's Warriors did.
Devin Booker
Devin Booker?
"So I guess we’re just going to forget KD’s daggers in back to back finals? Regardless of playing on a stacked team most people know about those shots, especially the one he hit over Lebron. The reason nobody remembers those Harden performances other than Harden stans is because he’s know for coming up short in the post season. Idk if you’ve heard the phrase, “history is written by the victors”.  Devin Booker had four 40 point games these playoffs with two of them in the finals and I guarantee the only people who will remember it in a few years are Phoenix Suns fans."
"When scoring isn’t enough  Devin Booker put up 70 and still lost.  Think it was last year where Bradley Beal got a few 40pt games and somehow still kept losing while almost leading the league in scoring.  As an individual or team you can score all the points, but if you can’t win then it’s kinda pointless. It’s why the other aspects are so important"
"Well, it's like how Devin Booker is the Donovan Mitchell of the NBA, you get me? Just extraordinary players."
"Devin booker, kobe bryant, Karl Malone,Richard Jefferson,Jalen rose. Just to name a few. Look what booker did his first two seasons. Multiple 50 pt games. Even had a damn 70 pt game. So is booker working harder or is he more talented?"
"Neither is Jimmy Butler. I’d take donavan mitchell, trae young, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, over both of them"
"&gt;Ya, they have him 17th also behind Devin Booker.   looking at this list and re-reading this comment makes me realize how stupid it was for me in hindsight to think the Suns were going to sweep the Bucks lol  yeah definitely not my proudest sports take"
"Ya, they have him 17th also behind Devin Booker. Beal just had a better season points wise, Booker a better season results wise. They did put Trae ahead of Chris Paul and Irving, which I also agree with.      You can have you own take, but for trying to make a non-controversial list they got the ordering right."
"&gt; Yeah, my mistake for interpreting his starting 5 exactly as he presented it. Fuck me, right?  I guess? Just seems weird that you wouldn't assume the ability of the coach to just play whatever lineup they think is best. Like did you assume come playoff time they wouldn't be allowed to have lineup adjustments? But whatever, my bad for assuming, sorry.  &gt; Oh, please. Every contending small ball team in the last 5 years could at least shoot from 4 out of 5 positions.  Yes I agree, if clarke was playing big minutes next to simmons there would be problems. But besides that I just don't see the need for 5 shooters. The whole point of small ball is to have 5 quality offensive players, and so that you don't have to play some unskilled big (e.g. rudy gobert). Simmons would still be a fantastic small ball 5, on offense at the very least.  &gt; And so is saying they are a contender when you have multiple teams with top 10 players they have to compete against. Simmons can’t be your second best player on a championship team.  I think the jury is still out on Ben Simmons when he has a team built to accommodate his deficiencies. Sure this team would never be favored to beat the nets or lakers, but the way most people use the term ""contender"" is fairly broad. I could say something like ""a team with devin booker as their best player when there are teams with multiple top 10 players will never be a contender,"" but most people consider the suns to be weak contenders at worst. Also FYI I never even said this team would be contending, although I think they would be, when you consider the normal, broad definition of the term.  I'll just add, in 2017-2018, the sixers went 52-30 and were the 3rd seed in the east (this was good enough for 3rd in the west too). Joel Embiid played 63/82 games last year. Jo/Ben's best supporting players were robert covington, jj redick and dario saric. Fucking Jerryd Bayless played about 20mpg in the regular season. In other words the supporting cast was dogshit and they had 60 games of embiid instead of james harden, and that team still was the 3rd seed. I hope this shows why reading that the team in OP's post has a ceiling of 5th seed gives me an aneurysm."

"Don’t get me wrong I don’t want to see Zion requesting a trade in year three or four, but I don’t really blame him as much as other people. Can’t ignore 3rd coach going into his 3rd season, couldn’t land any free agents although I think the trades Griff made were good considering what he was working with, but it is organization that hasn’t really put too many good teams together.  Devin Booker toughed it out for 4/5 seasons and I definitely wish Zion would follow suit but there isn’t any history in New Orleans to think things will be different from AD or CP."

"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
Don’t you dare make that accurate comparison then come at me with devin “Instagram eyebrows” booker.
He's got the front profile of Cinna-man from those apple jacks ads imo but my dark horse candidate would be someone like Devin Booker
"Anyone off-ball and can shoot for the back court, front court anyone who doesn’t distribute much. Gotta go with devin booker(and Collin sexton but that would be too homeristic for September 2021)."
"Eh, it still did happen though. People turned HARD on Devin Booker on here and the complaining about calls and stuff"
"Top Heel: Devin Booker and Phoenix      Top Babyface: LeBron, he’s gonna lose his sanity by halftime of Game 2 with all the boneheaded turnovers Russ will make"
That’s literally been ESPN’s agenda for any star playing for a smaller market team. I’m just waiting for some random Chris Paul hamstring strain for the Devin Booker rumors to start
"Marcus Smart as borderline all star in the same category as Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Vucevic, Domantas Sabonis, Devin Booker, De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, and Bradley Beal?  I’m sorry but yeah fucking right, okay buddy lmao  This is why you don’t just rely on analytics alone"

"To further explain, people on this sub blamed Devin Booker being sub-par in crucial moments against the Bucks on being unable to deal with double teams. A point that was disputed by Sun's fans, who asserted that Booker has been getting double teamed for ages. It kind of became a meme when Jrue stripped him in that play leading to the Giannis dunk."

"I'm lazy and picking recent things but Devin Booker was producing highlights at an almost never-before seen level in the finals but now no-one can post them for like a year or two because they lost the series.  The Kyrie ankle-breaker on Thanasis got posted, but no-one can touch [this objectively superior clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxc0KPZ6iUc) because it was Game 6 and we know how it ends."

the shotmaking of devin booker and the luggage packing of trevor ariza
"It's not just about limiting what kind of shots they take, it's also about limiting WHO takes the shots, which is the part you're missing. A shot at the rim might be worth more than a 3-pt shot on average, but I'd rather have Fred Kaminsky shooting from the paint than Devin Booker shooting from 3-pt land.   In game 2 Devin Booker attempted 12 3-pt shots. In game 3 he shot 7. Even if he'd shot them at the same % (which he didn't) clearly one is a better outcome for the buck than the other. Jrue made that better outcome, and that's what you miss about perimeter defense."
Can Patrick Beverley guard Jayson Tatum?   He did a pretty good job on Devin Booker.
"It's definitely not weird that KD hasn't scored 70, there's only 11 70+ point games in NBA history and Wilt Chamberlain has 6 of them (Kobe, David Thompson, David Robinson, Elgin Baylor, and Devin Booker have the others)."
there is no way you can actually believe that Jayson Tatum is a better fit in Phoenix offense over Devin Booker
Devin Booker is like 2 weeks older than me. That always fucks me up
Steph Curry  Jason Kidd  Devin Booker  Blake Griffin  Kyle Kuzma  ...or are you going by blood quantum laws or something?
I saw a Tim Duncan highlight with Devin Booker in it and it was weird to see they were in the league at the same time.

devin booker is gonna be going into his 7th season this year  like  wtf   hes only 24
I don't know if it's true but I heard Tyler Herro's favorite player growing up was Devin Booker

"I want to refer to everyone as that now.   Devin ""Second Place"" Booker."
At least KD didn't get destroyed by Devin Booker
I feel like people in this comment section are still viewing LeBron like he's 2018 LeBron  The man literally just went an entire playoff series without scoring 30 points in one game and got outplayed by Devin Booker
Nba executives definitely shouldn’t use them much. Theyre not worried about who’s better between like Donovan Mitchell and Devin booker have so much film and data to analyze if a free agency decision between two guys comes up.  We fans don’t have anything better to talk about and don’t watch enough film or have access to that data
cough Devin booker cough. easily the worst 70 point game ever.
"I’m not sure about putting Giannis over Kareem, just yet.  Devin Booker over Steve Nash?"
So Devin Booker this year?
"Probably Bucks, Mavs, Grizzlies, Hornets, Clippers, Nets, (Lakers maybe?) and even Phoenix tbh depending on how much they trust Devin Booker"
"As a Suns fan I don’t know what I’d do…Devin Booker is amazing, but Nash, Marion, Barkley…I don’t know"
"Everybody is hating one these terms but I feel like when used properly you are essentially describing the whole point of the spear or the guy throwing it analogy. I feel like most of the it’s a poor way of describing how well someone can play with others combined with volume vs efficiency. There are exceptions to every rule but it’s almost accurate.  Take kris Middleton, klay Thompson, devin Booker, all of these guys are people I consider ceiling raisers. Guys that can’t carry your offense for an entire season but can make it elite. These guys are all pretty efficient   Compare that to Rudy gobert, Westbrook, , all guys that can carry a team but you have to scheme around some facet of their game so they need some specific pieces to be effective  Some guys can do both, Lebron, Kawhi,"
"This is a joke, but I'm on this block. Standing reach is more what we care about than height, but we're so used to height that it would look weird to put reach as main attribute.  The whole advantage of ""height"" is how quick you are able to get your hand to a certain level. Tyler Herro is 6'4.5"" with a standing reach of 8'4.5"". Devin Booker is 6'4.5"" with a standing reach of 8'6.5"". Those two inches can be a big difference in getting off contested jumpers and finishing at the rim."

I'd go with Devin Booker.. his playstyle is what 90% of the people on NBA 2k create their player to be if they pick a wing.
He's a socialite. Imagine a Kardashian making fun of him for not shooting like Devin Booker or worse than Tristan Thompson. That'd be hell for him.

Chris Paul, LeBron, Luka, Kawhi, Steph, Trae, Harden, Lillard, Paul George, Tatum, Devin Booker. If you gave these guys Giannis's body and athleticism, yet they could do the same things they do with their smaller bodies, they would be like those made up players in NBA 2K10. Imagine Chris Paul or Steph Curry at 7 foot with Giannis's speed and athleticism, lol. It wouldn't look real."
"there was (is?) a segment of Blazer fans who thought Zach Collins &gt; John Collins and would not listen to reason on the subject.  Also the Lakers &amp; Nets flair are pretty horrid, but then again so are lots of Celtics flair.  Really every team &amp; player has asshole fans/supporters, there are 4M r/nba subs and we skew heavily toward the nephew demo.  The only fanbase that doesn't get all up in arms are the Suns, but maybe that's just because I think Devin Booker is as good as they do..."
"Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker"
Devin Armani Booker
Monkey's Paw: The Phoenix Suns have traded Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton for John Wall. The Suns will now be paying veteran guards Wall and Chris Paul a combined $75 million this coming season.
Don't forget that Lonzo Ball is better than Devin Booker  /s  For real I feel like for whatever reason PGs and Cs are rated way higher than anyone else is
ITT Fuck Devin Booker apparently.  But KAT &gt; Every center not named Embiid or Jokic.
"That's the point, though. ""Devin Booker is not a top 15 player"", ""I would take Brown/Ingram/Siakam over Simmons"" or ""Duncan&gt;Kobe"" are not unpopular opinions."
"I always find this debate interesting. If you look at it purely from a championship perspective Bam might be a better pick. The only team that's won a chip this decade with a volume scoring point guard as the focal point was the Warriors with Steph. But if you look at almost all the other championship teams there was at least one complementary wing or big that made a huge difference. The Bucks had Middleton, the Lakers had AD, the Raptors had Siakam, the Warriors had Draymond, the Spurs had Kawhi and Duncan, and the Heat had Chris Bosh.   Outside of Curry, the best players in the last several years that have consistently fit that volume scoring archetype and have consistently played for playoff teams are guys like Lillard, Harden, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Westbrook, Devin Booker (I'm probably missing a few names and I might be giving Mitchell and Booker too much credit), and none of those guys except Kyrie have won a chip. All of them have been to at least a Conference Finals with the exception of Mitchell - who's never made it past the second round - which means they've been on legitimate contenders at some point. Kyrie doesn't win a championship without LeBron and while Booker probably would have won if his team had someone like Bam who could check Giannis.   That's why I find the debate so interesting if you're trying to build a championship team. In a redraft you'd probably take most of the guards I listed over the specific versions of the players I listed in the first paragraph with the exception of Davis (especially considering Bosh and Duncan weren't their most dominant selves and Kawhi wasn't expected to be as good as he's become), because you're mainly trying to raise the floor of a team, but I feel if you're trying to raise the ceiling of a team and win a championship those elite complementary pieces are more valuable than the elite scoring guards."
Zach Lavine &gt; Devin Booker Go Bulls!
"honestly that would be a good trade. CP3 has two years left in him max, you could see how gassed he was in the last two rounds of the playoffs. Simmons would fit Phoenix perfectly since they effectively play 3 out and Ayton has shown an improving middy game. Plus, unlike in Philly, they have Devin Booker to take over as lead ballhandler in the playoffs ala 2019 Butler. In Philly's perspective, all CP3 needs to do is run the half court offense and control tempo. He does not need to be taking over on offense with Embiid and Tobias Harris (when he's aggressive)."
"Half is too high but he’s definitely in the 18-25 range. Players I’d definitely take over him:  1) Lebron 2) Giannis 3) Curry 4) Harden 5) AD 6) Jokic 7) Luka 8) Dame 9) Kawhi 10) Jason Tatum 11) Joel Embiid 12) Zion 13) Donovan Mitchell 14) Kyrie 15) CP3 16) Paul George 17) Trae Young  I’d also struggle to put him over Devin Booker, Butler, And Beal."
Zach Lavine &gt; Devin Booker
In this Sub? It ain’t that unpopular. r/nba hates Devin Booker. Lmao
Zach Lavine &gt; Devin Booker
"That's a little revisionist. Chris Paul only had one offensive explosion and that was game 4 with a whopping 18 points. Cam Payne, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton were the offensive threats for the series. Plus, Gasol was actually hitting threes compared to everyone else on the roster -- and Drummond was getting cooked regardless, so when both centers are defensive negatives, it's clear which one is better to play.  In games 4 and 6, Gasol's three point shooting helped the Lakers to close the 18-20 point lead that was made. It wasn't enough, but he made the games closer with his offensive presence."
"the truth is Zion is a great basketball player, he's gifted, but sports media needs a new LeBron and soon.  You're exactly right.  Zion also has been overshadowed by Ja Morant, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Devin Booker, and DeAndre Ayton.  Those last three guys were the business in those playoffs.  They NEED a new number one best player undisputed"
"&gt; Meh, weirdly it doesn't happen with someone like Morant, it didn't happen with KD, it didn't happen with Embiid, it hasn't happened with Trae, with Jokic. It happens when teams do a shitty job.  The one you've missed out is Shai. Because he would absolutely be a star with the Knicks, or any big market team trying to win. He's anywhere from the 3rd-6th best shooting guard in the league, he's two years older than Zion and his team is actively trying to lose. The only trade rumours we get for Shai are that maybe OKC doesn't want him, not that he wants to be elsewhere.  If it was just a case of a team having a star player but the team does a shitty job there'd be *way* more noise on other players. And it certainly didn't stop the chatter about Giannis leaving when Jrue was traded, if anything it made it louder. *Last season* there was noise that Devin-fucking-Booker was looking for a way out. Stop trying to look for a rational, objective, basketball-oriented reason in the noise because that's not the explanation it's transparently markets, transparently media and transparently views-driven. It's usually the Knicks or the Lakers (Dame, Beal, Zion, Booker) the star usually has to be well known (hence nothing for Donovan Mitchell, but plenty for Zion and Giannis) and usually it's a player from a small media market. It's not that complicated. If you say Zion might join the team the needle landed on on your wheel of teams-with-large-fanbases people will click on the thing, or listen to your thing, or watch your thing, and you can make money from that."
sir   sir  sir  devin booker  as a small forward  sir
Yeah pretty much that range maybe current Devin Booker as well....they would just need a competent team to compete
"what does empty stats even mean? putting up big numbers on a losing team doesnt make them empty. And we've constantly seen that once those players get help, those stats suddenly become meaningful- Devin Booker.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Also Jerry Stackhouse was actually above average TS% that year despite shooting 40% because he got to the line alot."
This year has got to be Brook Lopez shot clock violation against the Hawks in ECF and Devin Booker intentionally fouling when he had 5 fouls in Game 4 of the Finals
"Lol at Lamelo being an ""honorable mention"" when he's not even a top 10 PG  Lol at Devin Booker being 13th ahead of Kyrie and PG  Lol at Harden being below Embiid when he should be 5th"
"The list:  1). Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  2). Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  3). LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4). Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  5).

Ignoring this fact is the biggest issue. Tip toeing around subjects like race and avoiding how race plays a factor in alot of things isnt doing anybody any favors. Nobody is actually colorblind and we have to stop pretending like we are. Im not saying everyone should be a proud racist but we should be able to acknowledge our biases.  And Luka is elite. Its not too far fetched to have him as a favorite. It gets weird when a middle of the road player like Tyler Herro gets hyped to the point where people are legitimately wanting him over James Harden. You’d never see something like that said about more promising young talent like Brandon Ingram or Devin Booker.
"I can't remember it exactly maybe someone can help me out. Devin Booker had a nickname in college due to the fact he loved eating ass and pussy. All the girls on campus used to lick the rims on his car as an inside joke played off as a ""good luck ritual"". But I can't for the life of me remember the name they gave him. Rim Job Rob? Idk."
Since Bouknight acts like a Devin Booker and carried his team’s offense no one is taking THT over him. Only thing Davion doesn’t have on THT is age and height and that didn’t seem to concern too many people.

He is not as good as the following players Lebron  Kd  Giannis  Kawhi  Luka  Paul George  Steph  Dame  Klay  Embiid  Jimmy butler   Donovan Mitchell  Nikola jokic  Jamal Murray  Tatum  Rudy gobert  Bradley beal  Trae young  Kyrie Irving  James Harden   Anthony Davis  Devin Booker   Chris paul  So I put him around the top 25ish
"&gt;the first trade really didn’t have any blossoming young talent, that’s what the Hornets needed, pieces for the future  Goran Dragic is still playing in the NBA today! He wasn't 22 but he + Kevin Martin + Luis Scola is a way better trade than Eric Gordon and Al Farouq Aminu. Eric Gordon was overhyped as hell, imagine Devin Booker before last season's playoffs. THAT'S NOT THAT GOOD OF A PLAYER AND YOU'RE TRADING AN MVP CANDIDATE.  Again, the injury concerns were also there."
"KD &amp; Jokic have some of the deepest bags in the league.  I would also include Embiid, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, Luka Doncic and CJ McCollum on there as well.  LeBron also has a pretty excellent bag of tricks but it feels like he has relied so much on being bigger, stronger &amp; faster than everyone to get to his spots it's not as flashy as some of the other guys on this list."
"Fuck the suns, Chris Paul and Devin booker are such whiny players."
"[This is a good way to actually gauge defensive performances](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630558/head-to-head/?sort=MATCHUP_FGA&amp;dir=1)  There's more context involved with help defence and stuff, and sometimes if a dude gets completely lost on a screen it the tracking doesn't pick it up as guarded by them. For the most part though, this paints a pretty accurate picture of a defensive performance.  Only on possessions when Davion guarded them:  * Devin Booker went 1-3 * Mikal Bridges went 1-2 * Jae Crowder went 0-1"

I got absolutely decimated yesterday for saying that Ayton was the heart and soul of the Suns. Let me know when Devin Booker does anything besides scoring. It’s ridiculous Ayton doesn’t get more touches.
Chris Paul shot 1-10 tonight and accumulated six (6) points. Hield would look really good on the 1-3 Phoenix Suns right now next to Devin Booker.
KAT sounds like what u expect Devin Booker to sound like and vice versa. D book has such a deep voice
"Well shit, the Sixers could also have had Giannis in 2013 and Devin Booker in 2015 had they drafted them as well"
"2 way players need to be prioritized over scoring gods. If you aren't also playmaking for others, scoring doesn't impress me - most dudes in the NBA think they can score. Locking up on defense, or keeping a known flamethrower under 30 pts is more valuable than league minimum and a bunch of criticism about how they can't play basketball. This is fully why I believe the big has been devalued today - literally most of the MVP candidates last year were 7 footers, an athletic big has been a top 2 pick as long as I can remember, and the two teams in the finals last year punished the paint.   Equally unpopular is the idea that mid range scoring is dead, when you can't really name a top scorer who isn't deadly from midrange. KD, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, and so many more LIVE in the mid range. It's literally like 75 percent of all usable offensive floor space. Curry can do a LOT more than shoot threes, I think he's got most kids mind warped about what good basketball is."
"Cause Kemba and Horford are pretty close to washed and keeping them to try and make play in tournaments with Shai would be more of a waste of our time with him than trying to put a good young team around him like the Hawks did with Trae Young or the Suns did with Devin Booker.. so that y’know, we actually have a shot at keeping him for the real long term"
Most foul calls. But out of bounds is also dumb. Devin booker play in the finals last year where it went “out” off his fingertip. If we have to go frame by frame zoom in on some bullshit like that I also think it’s bad
Collin Sexton will be as good as Devin Booker. Theyve had very similar career trajectories except Sexton has actually been the more efficient player
Bradley beal is considerably better than devin booker.
Also better than Devin Booker.
Zach Lavine is better than Devin Booker
Devin Booker is the guard version of Kevin Love(in his prime).  Very good player. But third option on a contender at his absolute best.
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Here's another one: Bradley Beal making All-NBA over Trae and Devin Booker last season was ridiculous.
"I still don’t believe in Devin Booker or the Suns, like much at all. I think they had one of the luckiest playoff runs of all time due to opponent injuries."
Devin booker

"You proved yourself wrong lol. It is clear you still don't know how to read the stats you yourself posted so I'll humor you.

You can see Ant is at the bottom of the list, ahead of only Herro, McCollum, Ingram and Beal. Yet he also plays more minutes than all of the guys below him except for Ingram. Edwards is on the floor more than most guys and receives more passes than most guys but isn't passing.   But that's a small sample size, so let's look at last year. [Here](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=PASSES_MADE&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PASSES_RECEIVED*GE*38:MIN*LE*34) is the same link, but of guys who received at least 38 passes per game (Ant was at 40.2). And to be fair to him, I capped the minutes per game at 34 since he was only at 32 MPG last year.   If you're look for Ant on that list, you have to go to the 2nd page, where he is once again at the bottom of the league. This time there are only 3 people who passes less than him - Eric Gordon, Derrick White and Devin Booker.   It is very clear that of guys with Ant's usage, he passes the ball among the least in the NBA. So maybe instead of telling others they don't watch the Timberwolves you should pay more attention to what's happening in the games you watch."
You have Devin booker who pulls people down as they fall

It is my understanding that 538 is a literal real-time projection that becomes more accurate as the season progresses. Again, I’m not an expert, but I thought that it was widely agreed upon that those projections cannot be used as an indication of the postseason until at least a few weeks into the season. I think that such projections can be useful, I am not disregarding 538, but it is my understanding that there aren’t enough data for the projections to reflect reality just yet.  I said that it wasn’t crazy to assume the Bulls will get sixth seed in the East, which is literally what the Vegas odds you listed project, so I’m not sure where the disagreement there is.  The media is definitely not overrating the Bulls from what I’ve seen—if you can point to some overhyped TV segments or articles, I’d be surprised. I disagree with you about Zach LaVine—I mean, look where Devin Booker was without CP3. And look where Bradley Beal is (and has been) for years. But regardless, basketball teams are generally improved by adding very good players. The Bulls have done that, and we literally have only three people on our team that were there at the beginning of last season. This is not the Bulls team that people are familiar with—they are an exciting, fast-paced, fun to watch team that makes a real efforts on both ends. They have multiple guaranteed scoring options with some killer perimeter defenders. Our bench isn’t particularly deep, but it is better than bad with a few truly good players and prospects. Again, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised where we’re at in a few months! Feel free to rub it in my face if I’m wrong."
How you gonna give ayton 6 shots when he is being defended by nurkic. It seems the suns just pray Devin Booker scores 30 sometimes to win
they don’t call him devin “sneaky dirty stuff” booker for nothing
How do Lonzo and Devin Booker play even remotely alike?
Dude's essentially a less flashy version of Devin Booker. Bulls are lucky to have him
Don’t you know that he’s already clearly undeniably better than guys like Devin Booker and Zach Lavine???
It’s just funny cause most things posted on a huge sub like this are “LeBron comments on bench argument” or “Simmons suspended one game” or “Devin Booker with 45 points tonight”   and your thing is like “the Cavs made an 8 point swing during the game tonight” lol
"Kendall Jenner Sits Next To Hailey Bieber, While Cheering On Boyfriend Devin Booker at Suns &amp; Lakers Game in LA."
And how long did you guys have Devin Booker before you made the playoffs?  oh wait i know it was year 6.  Shai is in year 3 with okc if we take your word for it and it takes 3 years for them to get good then that means okc will be good in year 6 of shai.
"I don’t have a good reason.  I just don’t like Devin Booker.  He is amazing offensively but he just seems to pretend to be a tough guy.  An all bark no bite tough guy.  I realize my reasoning is dumb but that’s what it is.   I even try to look past it but can’t.  You haven’t earned that Kobe killer mentality yet, be humble."
"Trae, Joe Ingles, Devin Booker"
"Devin Booker, idk why he just pisses me off"
"I could never support a team with a racist and sexual harrassing owner, whose star player CP3 is known for playing dirty, other star Devin Booker pushes an opponent out of the air when mad, has Javale McGee on the team with the most championship experience, and talks shit even though they haven’t accomplished anything significant. But I guess that’s just me. Anyways enjoy these scandals that are about to hit the Suns organization."
Lol did you guys see him shove Devin booker for that rebound after Lebron's missed 3 with about 40 seconds left? Great assist \*cough\* travel at the end as well.
Devin Booker probably. He's only like 34% from 3 on his career I think and he's much more of an old school midrange guy.
Devin Booker and AD
Devin Booker
"Lol, Devin Booker"
Devin Booker. Trae Young
Wow did you guys know Kendall Jenner is dating Devin Booker?
*And in a bizarre move the DogeCoin Suns have traded Devin Booker for Tacko Fall and Screech from Saved by the Bell*
Devin booker looks like a shy guy kinda (the Mario enemy)
Devin Booker is absolutely cooking
"I can already hear Mark Jackson say; 'the late great Kobe Bryant, he told Devin Booker; be legendary'."
Have we gotten a corny Kobe tribute from Devin Booker yet?
"I can already hear Mark Jackson say; 'the late great Kobe Bryant, he told Devin Booker; be legendary'."
Why does Devin booker always look like 2k17's version of Booker?
devin booker rocking the baby 😭
AD has to finish that regardless of contact. That’s Devin Booker. You are A fucking D. Go the hell up like the beast you are man.
devin booker admires westbrook so much he resolved to miss all his shots
Devin Booker is coming up the fuckin beanstalk.
"I know that everyone is about to make jokes about this, but medically speaking this is actually really offensive.  Ben does ***not*** have a mental disability.  Even if you take the most liberal use in calling something a mental disability, it would still have to fall into one of the categories:  - **Developmental disability:** a chronic condition due to mental or physical impairments ***arising before adulthood*** (it is clear to everyone he doesn't have this). - **Disabilities affecting intellectual abilities:** these are learning and intellectual disabilities. - **Mental Disorder or Neurodevelopmental Disorder:** Yes, it's what you're thinking (mental illness and psychiatric disorders). - **Emotional or behavioral disorder:** This is typically used in referring children to special education, etc. Yeah I want to make jokes about his behavior too but this is wrong.  I truly hope that this doesn't hold up, as he is now trying to use a disability - something that effects millions of peoples lives - so that he can save money for ***literally choosing to not do his job***.  If I was another NBA player like oh, I don't know, Devin Booker for example - who does a ton of work for the Special Olympics and has a sister who (I think has DiGeorge Syndrome?) I would be absolutely fuming at this.  Before Ben was acting like a huge bitch about this whole thing, but this is truly a new low and honestly it's disgusting. This really is not cool.  Source for medical stuff: went to medical school."
"Point is, the Suns completely blew their only chance this decade to win a ring, and that’s that. Maybe if Devin Booker could shoot 3s they would have won something"

"Devin Booker, Murray, bridges, Tobias, and Gobert"
Tyler outscored Devin Booker by 27 tonight
"Man, he wishes. She's been with Devin Booker for more than a season.   He sat out the last time we played Phoenix."
"Devin Booker + Luka + Capela + Horford is my favorite ""what-if"" scenario right now"
Devin Booker in the finals pulling Giannis from Ayton
I'm late but it's hilarious how I see no posts of a Devin booker statline when I see a westbrook one after every single game
"""...and passes it out to Devin Booker, who has a great look!""  So would that make him Devin Looker?"
"As a Bulls fan, I truly don’t even see Booker being talked about in the same breath as Lavine. I’m sorry if this comes across as me being ignorant but Zach Lavine is without a doubt a better player then Devin Booker. If anyone can enlighten me, I’d appreciate it but from where I’ve been sitting the last 2 years its straight up highway robbery to say Devin Booker is better then Zach Lavine.   I’m sorry but Zach Lavine ain’t the same player he was 2-3 years ago. Everyone get your heads out of your asses and realize this man is top 15 in the league. Top 20 even if 15 is too hard a pill to swallow. Is Devin Booker top 15? Top 20? I just don’t see it. Please tell me I’m wrong."
A devin booker ben Simmons pnr with ayton slashing is basically the lob city clippers with the added threat of booker being a great shooter
CP3 and Booker definitely aren’t locks   CP3 has missed tons of all star teams in the last 5 years for usually health related issues and that’s not out of the question and Devin Booker has still never had a real all star selection yet. He is a 2x injury replacement all star
"KAT isn’t a top ten player. See below, I’m sure I’m forgiving some other obvious inclusions.  Lebron Steph Jokic Luka KD Harden Giannis Devin booker Donovan Mitchell Embid Etc."
It took Devin Booker 6 years to make the playoffs …
"It’s 1.5% TS gap, which paired with the point gap is decent. Not substantial but that’s comparable to the difference between say, Julius Randle and Devin Booker in terms of scoring numbers.   I was referring to stats like raptor with the lack of public explanation. BPM just doesn’t mean much cause it focuses solely on box stats. VORP is based on BPM with a few other factors. Box stats have little correlation with actual impact so it’s a flawed premise that creates a flawed stat with little use. RPM is the best of those stats based on its premise but it’s flawed. RPM suggests dame is substantially more impactful than jrue holiday is defensively for example.   I don’t think Garland is that much better than RJ, I’d like have them both in my 70-80 player range. I just think he’s better. He has edges as a scorer too, that matters more than the rebounding differential since rebounding doesn’t matter. It’s essentially the playmaking vs defence gap.   And no I said garlands playmaking edge shouldn’t be dismissed simply because of his position. Likewise Barrett’s defensive edge shouldn’t be dismissed because of his physical advantages. Their games and skills speak for themselves"
"Harden is a good one. That’s the main knock on him too though. And hey, if you wanna pick Blake Griffin, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray and whoever else over KD, Harden, Beal, PG13, Ibaka, Oladipo, Adams, Melo, and potentially LeBron and AD this year be my guest. I would take the second group personally."
"Draymond “Get Devin Booker Out of Phoenix” Green has complaints about these shows being gossipy eh, interesting"
Who is this Devin Booker? Is he a ball handler?
"Kendall Jenner, I assume?  Currently dating Devin Booker iirc, but it might've been a different player last year.  Too lazy to look up which games Simmons sat out."
"22-year-old scoring a moderately efficient 24ppg.   47.5% from the field, 37.1% from 3, 57.3 TS%. He's not a chucker by any measure.  It's a very fair request.   Looking at all +24ppg scorers ≤25-years-old from last season:    Player| Age| PPG ---|---|---- Zion Williamson| 20 | 27.0 **Collin Sexton**| **22** | **24.3** Luka Doncic| 22 | 27.7 Trae Young | 22 | 25.3 De'Aaron Fox| 23 | 25.2 Jayson Tatum| 23 | 26.4 Devin Booker| 24 | 25.6 Donovan Mitchell | 24 | 26.4 Jaylen Brown| 24 | 24.7 Karl-Anthony Towns| 25 | 24.8   I just don't see how Sexton doesn't clear 100m easily if he can keep it up. If you're in that age bracket and you're in that scoring bracket, it's a no-brainer.  We're not even talking about a 5-year max either."
They just need to swap out Jake from State Farm with Devin Booker and see if anyone notices.
And paying ten figures for the privilege to advise Devin Booker to leave Phoenix on national tv.
i have a biased question. why is devin booker never in nba marketing packages?
Devin Booker in a rip hamilton jersey woulda been fire
"Sexton is also seeking a massive contract though, which isn't something they are going to give him with CP3 and Devin Booker locked up. So they'd be renting Sexton for a season. Garland or Mobley would likely be they guys they'd want.  If they actually did end up shopping Ayton there would be much better offers than Sexton and Allen."
"I mean Sarver maxed Devin Booker, extended CP3, extended Bridges, and extended Shamet lol I get that his overall track record sucks but recently he has been spending money"
"&gt;There’s one element here which hasn’t been discussed publicly, but that Jones highlighted as part of the Suns’ thinking: If they had given Ayton the designated rookie max extension like they did Devin Booker in the summer of 2018, that move would have limited their ability to pursue stars on other teams who have already been given designated rookie max deals. Per the rules of the league’s collective bargaining agreement, teams can’t have more than two players on designated rookie max extensions. If they have hopes of adding even more star power here — and it seems clear they do — that factor does make some sense.  I thought this was kind of noteworthy"
"LeBron as Naruto, Curry as Sasuke and GSW as Taka, Devin Booker as Hinata, Jimmy Butler as Tsunade and Bam as Jiraiya lmao"
Devin Booker got his asshole bleached for nothing!
With the exception of Trae Young Dame Lillard and maybe Devin Booker every high level offensive player in the NBA who shoulders a considerable offensive burden gives more defensive effort than Donovan Mitchell. Every single one. It's a joke.
"""Oh that's cool they got the Heat in there, Jimmy looks rad. Oh the Jazz too? Can't wait to see what they did with Jrue- oh, okay. Knicks look pretty cool. Is that Devin Booker again? Are they in thi- oh it's a white Giannis. And it's over."""
....  is Devin Booker supposed to be Hinata?
"Yeah, he basically signed for the MLE which I think he would have gotten barring injury given his shooting ability. The non-guarantees make it a very tradable contact too.  For me, it's so obvious to see how Shamet will do well in the Suns' system during the regular season. In terms of the playoff rotation, it becomes a little fuzzier but there is still immense value in Devin Booker having a capable backup especially as they try to limit his minutes im after a shortened offseason."
"Devin Booker owns Paul George  (Hit the iconic game winner in the bubble, beat him in the playoffs, called him a bitch ass and beat him)"
"It's not all about what he currently is. That rookie contract extension is also what he will be for the Suns. This man is only in his 4th year in the league but has shown tremendous talent and fit with the Suns. We just saw his first playoff run, where he was one of the main guys on the team for both sides. He has a wide array of finishes in the post, and he has seriously improved defensively since his rookie season. He went from bad at defense to being able to handle his own against MVP big men like Nikola Jokic, as we saw from their series against the Nuggets. He deserves to get paid because he is the best bet the Suns have on a future center, and he will get better as time progresses and people will see that the contract will be worth it. Also, its not that he can't shoot, Ayton has above average stats for a big man. I mean, in a team with Devin Booker and Chris Paul, you don't need to shoot a lot, although he is capable of making shots from 3 - 16 feet. This contract should not only be banking on who he is right now, but also on who he can be for the Suns."
Or MAYBE (just maybe) the Suns are really good.  You know who else was off his game tonight?  Devin Booker.
"""maybe we're just better! Maybe we're just fucking better!""-Devin Booker (probably)"
I’m proud of him fr. I remember I always hated Russ playing point so when we drafted Cam I wanted Russ to move to the 2. I mean I actually wanted Devin Booker tho…crazy how they both end up on y’all team anyways lmao
"Devin Booker is winning at life. He gets to make millions playing basketball, got to meet his idol, and he's dating Catliyn Jenner. I wanna be just like him when I grow up."
Agreed. Devin booker missing the 2nd half really changed the tone of the beatdown.
"How did we do this without Devin Booker, man?  #17 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
Yea well it might have turned out different if…  *checks notes*  Devin Booker was healthy.
Devin Booker was also out...
Nah Devin Booker is better  -Suns fans
"but Devin Booker is out for them too... like legit out not just playing like ass ""out""..."
"Just as we all predicted, Devin Booker not playing and the Warriors making runs when 4/19 Steph is out of the game."
Devin Booker was cookin too. If both teams are full strength it’s a tough call
bro we are barely in the game with devin booker out rn why post this
"Devin Booker has the 2 highest points created per touch seasons of all time, and he didn't make the all star game in either season.  Just sayin."
"That's why there's so many posts about Donovan Mitchell, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker and Jimmy Butler eh"
Devin Booker always looks so sad and soulful
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"Devin Booker  Team  17-3 23.9 / 5.1 / 4.7 / 1.0 / 0.3 / 2.8tov .565 ts%/ 1.2 BPM / 2.0 RAPTOR / 1.6 WAR per 100 stats 34.4 points / 7.3 rebounds/ 6.7 assists / 4.0 turnovers  lavine  team 14-8 25.3 / 5.2 / 3.7 / 0.5 / 0.3 / 2.6 tov .599 TS% / 2.7 BPM / -0.9 RAPTOR / 0.7 WAR per 100 stats 35.5 points / 7.3 rebs / 5.2 assists / 3.7 turnovers   so it is close between lavine and book, however ill say they give it to cp3 lol"
"They beat a beat up injured nets team to get there and a sun's team who had no right being in the finals too lol. He can't take over a game the same way wade could. Yeah jokers great, high usage rate to run the offense so of course his assist numbers will be high but again he ain't won shit and they play in a time where defense is non existent. Wade would average 20 free throws a game in today's NBA (I know this year they've started allowing a little more physicality) but did you actually watch wade from 06-09? He would be unstoppable. If Devin booker can have that much success last season, wade would be double as successful."
"Just like how Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, KAT, and AD were not good enough a few years back right?"
Very Devin Booker scoring 70+ esque.
"I don't think he's making it. Steph Curry and Luka Doncic will start at the guards. The reserve spots will be Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, &amp; Paul George.   If you consider Paul George a SF, then Anthony Edwards should fill that reserve spot.  Only way he's making it is if there are multiple injuries."
"I know Chris Paul and Devin Booker absolutely feasted in the PnR last year. That wasn't because Jokic was gassed. Your metrics don't mean shit when playoff games come down to who defends a PnR the best. Like I said, maybe a Jokic led offense can be better than what he gives up on defense, but until I see it he will always be a tier below the top guys."
"I don't think he's making it. Steph Curry and Luka Doncic will start at the guards. The reserve spots will be Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, &amp; Paul George.  If you consider Paul George a SF, then Anthony Edwards should fill that reserve spot.  Only way he's making it is if there are multiple injuries."
Devin booker had 8 in a finals game it’s really the next logical step
"That’s because Chris Paul is a top three midrange shooter ever and Devin Booker is very good as well.   The fact that it’s a better percentage shot is meaningless unless it’s a down-to-the-wire, must-score possession. In the aggregate, you’re going nowhere if you take more midrange shots than threes."
*Devin Booker has entered the chat*
"Chris Paul has the god given talent to take all the credit for team accomplishments which reduces the credit Devin Booker gets. It happened when he was on the Thunder too. There was no talk of SGA, Schroder, Gallo, or Adams on big sports media outlets. Just CP3 “carrying” the Thunder like he’s the only reason they had any success at all last year."
"Devin Booker.  When Book had better stats than his peers: *""OK sure but what about the wins??""*  When Booker had more wins and made it further in the postseason than any of his peers: *""OK sure he has the wins but what about the stats??""*"
"If you're trying to make the best possible team with a starter from each team in the division, then Pacific should be -   PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Paul George  PF: Draymond Green  C: Anthony Davis  And this team is better than any of the other teams"
devin booker with the 50/50/90
Devin Booker is a superstar
Devin Booker is a superstar.
I said in a thread after Devin Booker's last game he had an argument for being better than Booker and was downvoted like crazy...is that really such a hot take?
"I've been a pseudo-Suns fan since the 2000's because of Steve (Vancouverite) and Devin Booker has always been one of my favorite players, Monty one of my favorite coaches, CP one of my favorite PGs... anyhow, yeah, I felt the same way in the heat of the moment, but then I saw him and his raw emotions come out on the court, him with his teammates seeing how much he truly cares about the people he goes to war with on a daily basis and I just couldn't do it lol   Felt no remorse when we wooped 4 in a row and won a chip doe.."
"Nd again a lot of ppl in this sub started watching basketball when curry won his first mvp so they wouldn’t know much about 2000s basketball the first finals the mavs and heat played was beautiful , lakers vs celtics was amazing , the iq was high and the game was just pleasing to watch , no inflated numbers &amp; 70 3s a game , that’s not appealing , that’s why I watch certain players that give me that 2000s vibe like klay , kd, kyrie , Chris Paul , devin booker,  demar , &amp; even melo at times, Lou will ,&amp; Jamal Murray , the mid range is the most deadly shot in the game , n can make you almost unstoppable if you can take it to the whole and have a respectable 3 , nothing will ever beat a two dribble pull up or one dribble pull up &amp; that’s why steph is so revered bc his doing that at the 3 point Line which is insane"
"They average less FTA’s than 14 other teams and are in the top half of the league in personal fouls. Devin Booker leads their team with 4.5 FTA/G, 28 players take more FTA/G than him. They have lead in FTA’s in 8 of their 20 games, had less FTA’s in 10 of their games and been tied in FTA’s in 2 of their games.   I don’t watch every Suns game but I’m sure they’d be getting more FTA’s and be committing less fouls if they got every call in their favour."
"You clearly don't watch the games lol. Those players go off because our guards can't contain. For instance, when Gary Harris returned to the bubble to guard Donovan Mitchell, he suddenly stopped his supernova streak. When we put a good defensive guard on the other team's best guard we suddenly did great lol. Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, and Devin booker were all guarded by our 3rd stringers..."
"Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Devin Booker going nuts and having historically great playoff series attacking Jokic the past 2 playoffs is probably not a coincidence."
"""Do people assume all your problems got solved because a big strong Chris Paul showed up?""  Devin Booker: ""yeah, what is up with that?"""
"Devin Booker is better than Gobert, but not for that reason  plus, i don't think any reasonable person thinks gobert is a straight up bad defender. Maybe overrated but definitely not bad"
"But you can't bring up adjusted plus minus metrics without 5 people complaining about ""wtf Devin Booker is better than Gobert, look how many points they score, and Steph Curry crossed up Gobert once years ago so he's a bad defender too"""
Trey Lyles was drafted above Devin Booker.
"Oh yeah Steph obviously had a way better shooting season than Harden but he still got close. it was 378 to 402, 22 3s is a good lead but it showed Steph's records not unbeatable. Also Devin booker averaged 23.4 less points then wilt did in his prime season, I get the hyperbole but cmon lol."
"Saying Harden came close to beating Steph’s 3 point record is like saying Devin Booker got close to Wilt’s scoring records. Not even in the same ballpark, Harden just shot a ton. When Steph did it he shot over 45% from 3, Harden shot under 37%"
"Other guy said Devin Booker had a stretch shooting 40% + from 3 in his rookie season. You questioned why that matters, because every player had stretches like that. But I don't see you questioning why this entire post matters because it's about a 20 game stretch of shooting 40%+."
"He's going to be 37 in a few weeks, short of acquiring a Luka Doncic, Devin Booker or a Trae Young, he's done winning championships if they can't turn it around this season.  They've backed themselves into a wall with a poorly assembled roster so unless he's willing to go a place like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas or Phoenix where he can be more of the Robin to someone else's Batman, I think he's done."

*Pulls off mask to reveal Devin Booker.  “Also … tell them that I’m better than Donovan Mitchell.”

Wilt was next level shitty for guys who actually got to the line a lot. Like Giannis sucks at it but the difference between him and Wilt is about the same as the difference between him and Devin Booker. It’s hard to play basketball for a living and still barely hit half your FTs.

Devin Booker
"When Devin Booker scored 70 on the Celtics, the Suns lost by 10. But that game wasn't as close as the final scored indicated, bc the Celtics were in control the entire game. Same thing as tonight. Suns won by 6, but the game was NEVER in jeopardy"
Devin crybaby booker
"#I got two words for ya. DEVIN BOOKER AND CHRIS PAUL, MUST SEE TV"
"Booker is our MVP overall, but CP3 often makes a bigger impact in the fourth.  The other team's best defender is almost always assigned to Book, and since Devin plays so physically, that defender is often allowed by the refs to play more aggressively.  So Devin sometimes gets swallowed up in the last 5-6 minutes.  Because of all the attention on Booker CP can isolate whoever who chooses to in the PNR.  All of this action is opened by our other players, though.  Ayton is too athletic and skilled for the opposing big to hedge and recover.  Mikal can't be helped off of because he's shooting 40% from 3 but is also one of the best slashers in the league.  The same goes for Cam Johnson (but not as efficiently).  Every player in completely bought into the system.  And our action is perfectly designed for this team.  We milk the clock a little too much at the end of games, but other than that the ball is constantly moving.  The double screen for Booker at the elbow just makes it too easy for this team to find their spots."
"Bruh what? Twice in the game, Nets brought the 20 point lead down to single digits. You had to bring Devin Booker and Ayton back in to make sure you didn't lose lol."
Devin booker is dating joey chestnut
If anyone thinks the Suns would even be half as good without CP need to cut it out. Devin Booker was 2 games from winning a ring and lost 4 straight.

Devin Booker now mayor of New York City
[Devin Booker has been fire for this road trip](https://streamable.com/r8w2cb)
But is Devin Booker actually good?
Devin booker is making that next jump to a superstar if he keeps playing like this good defense great passer and elite scorer
Devin Booker is my father
Feels good to see Devin Booker finally be surrounded by competent pieces
"Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Chris Paul hadn’t been in the playoffs until last year."
Devin Booker is a dirty man
"Devin Booker 11, Phoenix Suns 10, New Jersey Nets 8."
Zach Lavine and Devin Booker
1. Frank Kaminsky 2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul 4. Deandre Ayton 5. Mikal Bridges  6. Cam Johnson 7. Cam Payne 8. Jae Crowder 9. Javale McGee 10. Landry Shamet
He still better then Devin Booker
"That's what happens when we judge players solely based on championships. And give them 100% credit for team success regardless of their stats.  It's kind of like Devin Booker - he's been an outstanding player since he came into the league, dropped 70 in a game, got absolutely zero credit or respect. But after the Suns  winning games and going to the finals now people will admit he's a great player. Did he actually improve as a player in a major way in the last year or 2? Not really, his team just won more games."
There was nothing that the Knicks could have done to stop Devin Booker. Perhaps leave him open but he was going to get his no matter what and the Knicks had to get out of the way. Very convincing win this Suns team is staying hot and fresh as the beneficiaries of a productive bench. I feel this team is ready to go B2B against the Nets.
"Well then I don’t know what the fuck your point is since stars still take a ton of midrange shots. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, CP3, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, Kyrie Irving, etc. all take a shit ton of midrange shots. Even stars who aren’t good at them like LeBron, Jayson Tatum, or Anthony Davis shoot them all the time.  Most of the change we’ve seen is role players shooting threes instead of spotting up for abysmal long twos that they should never take except if they’re at risk of a shot clock violation."
"What? I’ve literally watched every game, I love the suns. I can confidently say Devin Booker has been the better player between the two"
"Yeah you know. WC champs, second seed in the nba currently and last season? Chris Paul, Devin Booker? I’m sure you’ve heard of them"

I'm not trying to be hyperbolic or anything but does Devin Booker have time to be the GOAT?
both sucked actually. Space Jam 3 with Devin Booker is gonna be deep trash
Devin Booker played in 0 playoff games before Chris Paul showed up.
so many missed shots in general lmao can’t believe people were saying he was better than booker during the finals in which devin booker actually took part.
"The late great Kobe Bryant, he told Devin Booker 'be Legendary'."
"ESPN: ""Is Devin Booker a literal murderer?"""
"Seems like it takes people a while to come around on parts of his game. First it was passing, and now he’s a legit good playmaker, now it’s defense but idk what people are watching if they Devin Booker is a negative defensively, he just isn’t anymore."
It really bothers me when on the box score they have points all the way on the right? it's a very annoying way to read it I'm a simpleton I just want to see if Devin Booker scored 70

"this guy just said a whole postseason 😭 Mitchell played 1 round and got bounced lmfao  We’re talking about Devin Booker who averaged 30 in the Finals, none of this first round second round bullshit"
Devin Booker is the Jameis Winston of passers in the NBA
"https://sports.yahoo.com/report-suns-offered-devin-booker-211157314.html  &gt; the Celtics offered a boatload of young assets, and the Suns were prepared to ship Devin Booker and swap a draft pick that would have placed the Knicks in position to draft Lauri. Former team president Phil Jackson thought the Finnish big man was built sturdier than Porzingis and would become more durable."
Devin Booker is absurd
brady has been the best player in the nfl for less time than devin booker has been in the nba   most overrated athlete of our generation is more like it

Devin Booker looked like he wanted no part of the basketball in the last few minutes.
"The Suns: Hey, our legendary veteran point guard hasn't missed in the 4th and we're down two with a full shot clock  Also The Suns: hey let's post up Devin booker"
Awful play out of the timeout.    Devin Booker postup?
"You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense.   &gt;players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing.  What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.    Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  Since you value winning so much, Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins. Beal is an older, less efficient shooter and doesnt translates to wins. Young is younger but is a lot less efficient in shooting, is completely terrible a defensive to the point where the team went through lengths to cover his flaws and doesnt translate to winning.  ( Some more inconsistency in your logic). Devon Booker and Demar are both leading their teams to the playoffs on winning teams....Hahaha.   It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao"
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he’s right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
Even the stars are replaced. Today's Devin Booker is yesterday's Gil Arenas. They're constantly shuffled in and out and the league will keep going long after the stars of today are gone.
Russell Westbrook has a higher career high than Durant(58-54).   Devin Booker has a higher career high than 10 time scoring champion and Larry’s brother Michael Jordan
No because that makes zero sense. If the Suns had the 2nd pick they wouldn't have taken Devin Booker. Shit the Nuggets took Jokic at 41. They took Doug McDermott at 11 that draft. I'm pretty sure they thought Doug McDermott was going to turn out better than Jokic.
Crazy how the Jazz turned their two biggest whiffs into two of the biggest home runs. Drafted Exum at 5 overall and traded him (and a couple seconds) for Clarkson. And drafting Trey Lyles instead of Devin Booker turned into Mitchell.
"Middleton and Brown are better by big margin, and then Booker is a tossup but I’d keep Donovan just cause I know he has good chemistry with the team, whereas Devin would be an unknown. Donovan’s better than everyone else on that list though"
I never wanna see ~~Gary Trent~~ ~~Devin Booker~~ Jordan Clarkson ever again
"There is no doubt Europe has the advantage in the front court, but The gap between AD and Jokic isn’t as big when you factor in defense, and you are underselling the overall disadvantage Europe has.  Europe has a great team, but the US has an insane team. Lebron, Steph, and Kawhi are too much regardless, and the US “B team” PG, Kyrie, KD, Dame, Kat would probably beat the Euro starters too. That’s without even including Harden, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Jaylen Brown, etc."
I really don't see what Mitchell provides that say Devin Booker can't give you.
"I agree with all of these, BUT... JB and Devin Booker are close. Very close. The only edge I give is Donovan is better then Book on defense and better then JB on shooting and playmaking. ALSO. I know he is a great playmaker and shooter but Trae Young is not as good as Donovan."
Better than Devin booker? Stop
"Devin booker can do it, he basically has and uses almost all of Kobe’s moves"
"Haliburton looks like the perfect complement to Devin Booker. He plays great D, stretches the floor, doesn't need to be ball dominant, and he knows how to set up an offense.  I was surprised Suns didn't take him at the time and I'm even more surprised now that I've seen how this has played out so far this season."
Devin tryna make her a Booker and a real Suns fan just in case.
I remember people trying to tell me he was better than Devin Booker
Devin All Star Booker
Devin Booker once missed out of PotW while averaging 52/6/6 with a 73 TS% because the Suns went 0-3. It's dumb but what can you do.
"&gt; Devin Booker had him self a week, going IG official with Kendall Jenner and going 4-0 while averaging 32/5/5 on 56/48/81  book immune to the curse confirmed"
"Huh? None of this makes any sense nor is true.  Devin Booker also was much younger than Lavine - also, now that Booker’s on a good team he probably won’t be an all star because his stats went down and cp3 has largely been driving their success"
"First, there’s scoring and then there’s *scoring*. And Lavine is a solid all-around player playing on a terrible team. People were saying the same thing about Devin Booker and now look - they put good pieces around him and they’re 4th in the west."

Devin Booker was a worse player on worse teams... what argument are you even trying to make
It's funny because I've never been a Suns fan or a Chris Paul or Devin Booker fan but I'm kinda finding myself heavily advocating for both CP3 and Book to make the All-Star game.      The Suns only won like 15 games two seasons ago and now with their current record they'd only be 1 game behind the 76ers for the \#1 seed in the East. Both of the Suns guards have been playing at an Allstar level and so when you combine that with a top 5 record in the league I think they really deserve to get in.
"Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan  EDIT: Also, we are not better without DeRozan, that take is so insane. He runs our entire offense."
1. KAT  2. KP  3. Devin Booker  4. Myles  5. Wood  THE REST ARE NOBODIES
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker need to be al stars. That’s it
Devin Armani Booker
"Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum, Demar Derozan, Kawhi Leonard"
Easy. Devin Booker.
Didn’t he say this then the next game get lit up by Devin Booker? I think he is a very good defensive player but I found that timing very funny
"Suprised Devin Booker is not on the list, I could see him going to the lakers for kuzma and a pick."
"As always, I fail to see why Devin Booker is considered ""better"" than LaVine."
Obviously Devin Booker right now wouldn't be the goat with a ring. But this Devin Booker playing 5-6 more years of this level and if he wins a finals MVP he is 100% looked at as the greatest Sun of all time.   He'll be arguably the greatest scorer in Suns history at that point also
"Only Nets can win against Lakers. But i don't think Nets will make it to Finals. People don't know how to rank playoff teams. Utah, Boston, Nets, Clippers, Bucks, Suns, Nuggets are really good teams. But sometimes good isn't enough. They gotta win 4 times against AD and Lebron. And supporting cast looks even stronger than last year. Kawhi is unlucky because he has the weakest duo. I would prefer Jamal Murray or Rudy Gobert over PG.  Edit: or Devin Booker"

"Most ridiculous game ever. Jazz have a blowout victory, Devin booker has a 59 point game, and who does the Jazz arena cheer for? Jimmer who went 1-10 (0-5 from 3). I remember seeing Jae Crowder’s face was frankly just disgusted at our fan base for how insane they were going for him. I get people being a fan (I lived in Utah and played church ball during Jimmer-mania, believe me I know how much people love him here), but that means cheering for him when he checks in and maybe for his first bucket but don’t cheer louder than you have for your own team. I wanna say Joe Ingles refused to answer a question about it after the game just walked away from the reporter lmao."
Mocha Mamba Devin Booker
"You should reconsider the SG spot imho. Watch some more Vince highlights, Klay's hot streaks, or anything by Devin Booker ;)  &amp;#x200B;  Good list though. I think you're cool."
Sure.  We’ve had ~1.5 seasons of Devin Booker basketball since then and he’s proven me wrong.
Devin Booker is top 5 from 25 and under...
I honestly don’t understand why trae is so popular. Like I don’t see a similar following for devin booker for example.
"Devin Booker doesn’t have an MVP, multiple top 3 finishes, a scoring title, and an assist title"
"Well yea he would have an argument. Like if Devin Booker did that, he'd probably be above Harden. 2 chips + FMVP is a lot"
"It’s not dumb. The Suns have never won a championship and if the Suns drafted Devin Booker takes the Suns to the Finals and win he will be remembered as the best. Charles and Nash won MVP, we have made a finals only losing to MJ. Winning a championship for the Suns will put anyone up there. Nash is 1 and Charles is 2 btw."
Devin Booker is overrated and you all know it!
"My mistake on Booker him winning a championship for the Suns would be huge I just think Barkley and Steve Nash were really really good, not a slight on Devin at all"
Why not? Popularity is irrelevant between two superstars on a forum about the NBA. If you were showing random people who probably wouldn't know Booker but would know Steph because he's a legitimate celebrity? Sure. But on r/nba? No. Lol. Anyone on r/nba knows who Devin Booker is
"Starters  G: Stephen Curry  G: Damian Lillard  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Lebron James  F: Nikola Jokic  Reserves  G: Luka Doncic  G: Donovan Mitchell  F: Anthony Davis   F: Paul George  F: Rudy Gobert  WC: Devin Booker  WC: CP3  These are just my predictions, not who I necessarily *think* should make it. For example, De’aaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he’ll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn’t good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
It's an NBA subreddit lol everyone here knows devin booker.
Devin Booker is their best player.
Devin Booker is half-Mexican just so people know      Post is deleted so no one will ever know lol
"If Devin Booker wins a championship with the Suns, he could very well be our franchise GOAT imo. Barkley wasn't here long enough, and Nash was only playing at a high level here in his 30's.  If Booker signs another long term contact and continues to produce like he has been and is the best player on a championship roster, I'd say the title is his."
"I'm not saying Devin Booker is a KGB spy sent to destroy the United States, I'm just saying that I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary."
Devin Booker is a superstar.
Devin Booker hates the Philadelphia 76ers lol. He always lights them and the Celtics up.
devin booker has one of the aesthetically pleasing game.
DEVIN BOOKER

More empty points from Devin Armani Booker
Ben Simmons and then girlfriend Kendall Jenner went on a double date with Devin Booker. Booker is now dating Jenner. This game is kind of like that.   Fun fact: the girl Booker was with was Jordyn Woods (now dating KAT). These guys need to meet new girls.
Devin booker 100% deserves to be an all star idk what else he needs to do at this point if he doesn’t get in

Battle of Kendall Jenner's Ex-Boyfriend Simmons vs current boyfriend Devin Booker.
Devin Booker. Overrated chucker.
"My list, with short explanations:  1) Donnic - it's not close, he's the next great star in the NBA.  If I could pick any player in the league to start a team with, it would be Luka right now.    2) Ben Simmons - there are going to be MVP considerations in his future.  Even if he never learns to shoot, Simmons will be, at worst, a Millionaire's Russell Westbrook in terms of size, athleticism and talent.   3) Jason Tatum - one of the absolute best young players in the game, I thought, long and hard, about including Jaylen Brown in this list, and if it were top 10, Brown would have easily made it.    4) Donovan Mitchell - he is a star, in every sense of the word, and will be a star for the next decade to come.    5) Devin Booker - this last slot came down to him or De'aron Fox.  It was close between them.    Next five for me, in no particular order:  6) Fox 7) Jaylen Brown 8) Jamal Murray 9) Domantas Sabonis 10) John Collins"
"Devin Booker is a better mid range shooter and finisher. His size helps him.  Mitchell has been more of 3pt shooter, and iso scorer when the clock runs down."
Devin Booker used to be our only lifeline.
I thought Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss were going to put us in the playoffs by 2018.   I thought Josh Jackson’s floor was Andre Iguodala.   I thought Devin Booker was just going to be a spot up shooter.   All my Phoenix Suns tales have been awful.
"That wouldn’t happen nowadays though. The closest in this day and age is Danny Green or (jokingly) McCaw but I don’t see Danny winning 4 more. A player who happened to win 12 rings being on the right place at the right time, in today’s day and age, would be a max level player, because clearly they’re offering some sort of intangibles if they’re able to do it for what is (presumptively) a majority of their career. So a LeGM player? We’re not gonna see anyone close to LeBron for a while, because that player isn’t in the league yet.   How do you not think 100 will happen in the NBA? Kobe scored 81 in an era where mostly 2’s were taken. Way less 3’s. Devin Booker scored 70 a few years ago when he wasn’t as good as he is now, Harden scored 60+ through 3 quarters, hell so did Kobe before he got 81. 100 is far more likely than someone winning 12 rings. Assuming even a very generous 20 year career, that means they have a higher Finals win rate than the current winningest player? And they’re not even in the league yet?   Bill Russell’s rings aren’t worth as much as the ones nowadays because he played against inferior talent and literally less teams. Back then with like less than 10 teams, everyone had a ring. No one is winning 12 championships as a player in the modern NBA."
I just want to see who the subreddit is comparing to Devin Booker on a day to day basis.
Jaylen and Devin booker are better than Ben simmons
If you say 11 rings you’re on crack.   Kobe was 19 points away from 100. Devin Booker was 30 away in his 3rd season. Imagine if one of those games went to double OT? Or if a Curry or Harden just went off for like 18 3 pointers and a ton of free throws
"&gt; easily all-NBA third team  I'm not saying he won't make it, but between the likes of Steph Curry, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Luka Doncic, Damian Lilliard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, and Devin Booker there's *a lot* of competition (and no doubt there will still be names that others will be throwing out there). Definitely wouldn't call him *easily* 3rd team."
"I've been on the 'Devin Booker is overrated' train for the past few years, and I have no plans on getting off now, but there's no reason for people to read into this statement."
Replace cp3 with Mitchell and probably add devin booker  Simmons is not making it this year put someone like trae young or Zach Lavine instead   I’m a wizards fan but Russell Westbrook probably won’t make it unless he steps it up these next few games
"My thoughts when I see Devin Booker being the best player of the team my team is facing: ""We're in good shape""  No downvotes please"
"i guarantee you devin booker, or literally any basketball players, didn’t need stats to know you can let giannis take free jump shots."
"The turnovers are bad but I think his shot selection is actually pretty solid, especially considering the role he’s often had to play in the bulls short handed offense this season.  I think everyone just sees that a lot of his faults could/would be papered over on a team where he didn’t have to do so much playmaking AND scoring.  Athletic two-guards with pinpoint accuracy are exactly the types of players who can tear up playoff defenses in the modern NBA. They’re offensive usefulness seems to even be surpassing the typical 6-8 power wing. Just look at who thrived in the bubble games: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, even Tyler Herro.  I salivate thinking about what Lavine would look like taking some pressure off guys like Giannis, Embiid, Jokic and Lebron."
No Chris Paul Devin booker?
Devin Booker was robbed of bubble MVP
"He’s properly rated, too inconsistent as of now, he has the potential to be good. Here’s the list right now of at least top 25, in no order, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Harden, AD, PG, Curry, Kyrie, Butler, Tatum, Jayden Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Luka, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Ingram, and I’m probably missing a few. These are the people who could carry their team, or at least have an impact of changing the team to at least a contender. Does Siakam fit in that list?"

We should've been out of sight by half time with a lead of 20+ but Devin Booker was unreal. Hit so many tough shots one after the other to keep it close and then we blew it in the third.
Devin Booker is unbelievable
For posterity: A lot of salty Suns fans below who have had to defend the greatness that is Devin Booker for years. Good players on bad teams can actually just be good players. :/
Devin Booker
Devin Booker in shambles.
This is disrespectful to Devin Booker
"   David Fleming ESPN Senior Writer     ON THAT MONUMENTAL day, the only thing Kobe Bryant carried with him was a basketball. It was early June 1996, on the morning of his now-legendary pre-draft workout in Los Angeles, when a skinny, smiley Bryant, then 17, stepped out of the swanky Shutters on the Beach resort in Santa Monica, California, with his favorite basketball tucked under his arm.  Waiting for him there in a Chevy Blazer was his driver for the day, Ryan West, the teenage son of NBA legend and longtime Lakers exec Jerry West. ""It was the funniest thing, but it showed the two sides of Kobe,"" says Ryan, now a scout with the Detroit Pistons. ""It showed the laser focus and dedication of Kobe but also the child-like nature of Kobe, bringing his favorite toy with him wherever he went.""  Having someone Kobe's own age show him around L.A. was agent Arn Tellem's idea. This workout was potentially the seminal moment of Kobe's young career, and Tellem wanted his prodigy from Lower Merion High School outside Philadelphia as comfortable and relaxed as possible. The year before, the 6-foot-11 Kevin Garnett had joined fellow bigs Darryl Dawkins and Moses Malone in making the leap from prep to pro. But Kobe was the first guard to dare make the jump. ""He's kidding himself,"" NBA scouting director Marty Blake told reporters at the time. ""Sure, he'd like to come out. I'd like to be a movie star, too. He's not ready.""  After working out for several NBA teams, though, Kobe, the son of former pro player Joe ""Jellybean"" Bryant, had been quickly climbing draft charts most of the summer. The Nets and their new coach, John Calipari, picking at No. 8, had already worked him out several times and were especially smitten.  From a marketing and basketball standpoint, though, Tellem knew there was only one place for his client: Showtime. All Kobe had to do was convince the team's architect and guardian, Jerry West, who had agreed to the workout only as a special favor to Tellem and had planned quite the comeuppance for the kid: Once he and Ryan dealt with the 405 Freeway, Kobe's on-court opponent would be Michael Cooper, one of the greatest defenders in NBA history.  What unfolded over the next 45 minutes inside the Inglewood YMCA still leaves most NBA insiders grasping for words 25 years later. Just not Ryan West. ""It's very simple to sum up,"" he says. ""Greatest workout I've ever seen.""  Witnessed by just a handful of people (the videotape recordings have vanished) Kobe's Lakers workout would ignite a nonstop frenzy of pre-draft machinations, subterfuge and intrigue before ultimately launching a legend, revitalizing a dynasty, revolutionizing a sport and inspiring one epic oral history. In the spring of 1996, Lakers GM Jerry West granted a favor to a friend -- agent Arn Tellem -- that the team would host a pre-draft workout for a 17-year-old named Kobe Bryant. Twenty-five years later, it's become one of the best decisions in NBA history. Juan O'Campo/NBAE via Getty Images  Mark Heisler, L.A. Times NBA writer, 1979-2011: Kobe was truly a prodigy. The word prodigy would have been invented for him as far as basketball goes. He told me once he thought he had a destiny in the NBA. I asked him: ""When did you first start thinking that?"" And he said: ""When I was 5."" Kobe didn't have ""overwhelmed"" in him. It was just the opposite. In Philly in high school, he had already been working out with the 76ers, and he didn't think any of these NBA guys could keep up with him, and to a large extent, it was true.  Bobby Marks, current ESPN analyst, Nets front office, 1995-2015: Back then you were allowed to have NBA players with three years or less of experience work out with draft prospects. So I ask Ed O'Bannon and Khalid Reeves to come in. Ed had just come off his rookie year, and he was the national player of the year before at UCLA -- and Kobe just dominated. These guys didn't take Kobe all that serious until he started lighting them up, and you could tell they had no idea what they had gotten themselves into until probably halfway through the workout.  Heisler: His dad was an easy-going guy, a sweet guy, always laughing. He wasn't a hard-nosed competitor. But Kobe was. And that part, that passion for the work, that came from his mom, Pam -- she was the boss of that family.  Joe Carbone, Bryant's strength coach, 1995-2004: I was with him for one of his Nets workouts, and the look on Calipari's face the whole time was like, ""holy s---."" Calipari says, ""Let me see you shoot the 3,"" and Kobe just starts stroking it effortlessly. So Cal says, ""Take a few steps back."" Boom. Swish. ""Take a few more steps back."" Boom. Swish. Cal says, ""That's it, I'm done,"" and then, kinda to himself, he goes, ""This guy's the next Jordan, I gotta get him.""  Marks: We should have made him a guarantee right then and there, shut him down and put him in the witness protection program until the draft. After workouts each team is responsible for the player's travel. We had a rule that guys who were 6-foot-8 or above would fly first class, and Kobe was not 6-foot-8. I pled with the gate agent about the middle seat, but there was nothing available. I remember thinking at the time, oh who the hell cares, he's a 17-year-old kid, too bad. Well, I remember getting my ass chewed out by Arn Tellem. You laugh about it now, but back then, trust me, it wasn't funny.  Heisler: I was in Chicago for the draft combine that year and I walked into the Chicago Marriott and I looked up and saw Kobe on the mezzanine level, standing by himself looking down into the hotel lobby. I introduced myself, told him I knew his dad, and he said he was eventually headed to Los Angeles to work out for the Lakers. He looked like a teenage boy a long way from home. Shy wouldn't be the right word, but a little bit withdrawn. Soft spoken. He looked lonely. The first thing you think when you see him standing there was: Can he hack it at this level? Editor's Picks      How Kobe almost became a Celtic     How Azzi Fudd became the best prospect in a generation     The rise of Devin Booker, starring Kobe, Jay-Z and CP3  Mitch Kupchak, Lakers GM, 1994-2017: We knew who he was. He played in the McDonald's game, but we did not get a glowing report from that game. It was a very pedestrian performance.  Heisler: Even Arn didn't know what he had. He was originally from Philly and he had taken Kobe on as a client, but he was good friends with Jerry, and Jerry had a really good eye. If he saw a good player, he wouldn't need to talk to 12 people to confirm it. He'd know right then.  John Black, Lakers VP of public relations, 1989-2017: Jerry was clearly a genius at talent evaluation. At the draft that year I was the Lakers' designated in-person team representative, the guy in the arena, on the phone with our draft room back in L.A. We had the 24th pick that year, and it was between Derek Fisher and Jerome Williams, a 6-foot-9 power forward from Georgetown. We were on the clock with three minutes to make our pick and I was on speaker phone with Jerry, who started going around the room asking everyone who they liked. Time is ticking down -- two minutes left, one minute left, 30 seconds -- and every person said Jerome Williams. So now the NBA rep is standing right next to me and there's 10 seconds left and he wants to know who our pick is -- and in my other ear I can still hear all the people around Jerry saying Jerome Williams, Jerome Williams, Jerome Williams. And I say, ""Jerry, time's up, who is our pick?"" And he says, ""John, we take Derek Fisher.""  Jerry West, Hall of Famer, Lakers front office, 1982-2000: I didn't set it up. Kobe's agent, Arn Tellem, did. We had been friends for years, and he said Kobe was in town shooting a commercial. I had watched film on him but had never gone to see him in a high school game. I was aware of his father and I was very aware of Kobe's story, but [drafting guards out of high school] just wasn't in vogue at the time."
Devin Booker. Fuckin wish he was on my team tho (that being said I'm so proud of us this year)
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Devin Booker. He got trashed on a lot early in his career because of his teams. Now that the Suns are good, people are realizing how good he actually is."
Someone should ask Devin Booker what his thoughts are on how Chris Paul has made the team so much better than last year.
"Zach LaVine plays defense like /r/nba thinks Devin Booker plays defense. I don't think I've ever seen a more eager/active player on both ends try to make the right basketball play with a lower IQ. His decision making on both ends is just so fucking poor! I think he's a starter on a good team, but I feel like I owe this sub an apology for arguing for years that you can't put up inconsequential stats on good efficiency, because watching this guy play over the last few years honestly makes me feel like a fraud."
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, DeMar DeRozan and Mike Conley deserved to make the All-Star Game over Devin Booker."
He really is a handsome dude. Man’s man. I’m not about that Kelly Oubre/Devin Booker pretty boy stuff.
"Well for starters he’s averaging less points, rebounds, and assists. Also he’s playing next to the point god, and he’s hasn’t exactly carried a team like other MVP SG’s have. I love Devin Booker but get real"
the bucks have a worse win % than the suns why is devin booker being left out of the mvp conversation
Okay so why shouldn’t we expect Devin Booker or Domantas Sabonis to speak out about it then?

Devin Booker getting snubbed from the All-Snub list.
It also reiterated that Devin Booker is quite disrespected
"""Dennis Smith Jr is a better prospect than Devin Booker""  ""Danny Green is a better shooting guard than Devin Booker""  I'm okay being a low-IQ fan if those are high-IQ takes."
“People talk about Devin Booker being disrespected”  *proceeds to disrespect Devin Booker*
Yes that sounds like famous humble quiet grinder Devin Booker.

"right.. Devin Booker is above answering ""stupid"" questions... its an insult to his greatness and humble beings like us wouldn't be able to comprehend anyway."
"&gt;Well that’s intentionally framing it in an insulting way  Kinda like the way Devin responded to the reporter who asked a very polite and complimentary question?   Book could've said ""I always felt like I was an all-star caliber player but only got recognition cuz we're winning this year."" Instead he chose a very rude and dismissive response for no reason.  And it's not insulting for the reporter to say Booker improved this season. If Booker thinks he's made no improvements at all, that reflects badly on him as a player, not the reporter for missing that."
"Ok, if the reporter had said ""Hey Devin, you've made no improvements in your game for the last 3 seasons, but you're finally getting recognition and an all-star selection now because Chris Paul decided to join you. How do you feel about that?""  Do you think Booker wouldn't have felt disrespected by this question instead?"
“Devin booker should’ve been over Zion”
"Overrated: Donovan Mitchell -- guy is an all-star 100%, but media talking heads are trying to get him in the MVP conversation when Gobert or Conley are technically having more consistent and stronger seasons than he is.   Underrated: Jordan Clarkson. He's getting 6MOY hype, but I don't people who don't closely follow the Jazz realize how good he is playing this year. If you compare his PER 36 stats to somebody like Devin Booker, they're actually really similar (Clarkson averaging fewer assists, more rebounds, and more steals, but similary scoring and shooting)."
"&gt; I get you’re trying to defend your boy  Yes, notable 76er Devin Booker lol  I don't know if you and other guy watched the video, but that's not what his question was lol. Booker is taking offense to him saying he's ""much better"" than last season, which isn't true. It shows it's an uninformed take and I think he's just moving on instead of saying ""I've actually been playing at a high level for a few years now, it's only when we're in the playoffs that guys like you start to take notice"".  His second question is also bad, asking a player what his ""motivation"" is after a regular season loss...idk if they have a past or anything but I understand Booker's perspective even if he is rude"
"We’re not talking about other players, we’re talking about Devin Booker. Which there is sufficient proof that what the players are saying is being backed up by their vote. Simple as that."
devin booker hate train here today and i am HERE for it
Devin trying his best kobe impression Booker
The league confirmed this was not a foul and also confirmed that Devin Booker was fouled on the last possession of the game which would have given 3 ft's.
PG: Devin Booker   SG: Jaylen Brown   SF: Jayson Tatum   PF: Domantas Sabonis    C: Bam Adebayo
"Ok I see your your just stupid, So An Injured kobe in 2000 is held against him, he saved that finals by the way I mentioned it. And how the fuck is he a liability in 6 out of 7 finals the lakers wouldn't have made a single finals without him.   And game score is the end all be all huh? So Devin Booker has the 6th best game of alltime?   Ya I'm done here go be an idiot elsewhere"
"Let me explain my perspective.   For years, Suns fans were holding on to hope that Bender, Chriss, and Jackson would all develop into something really good. Ya, i know it seems like i am joking, but i am not.   The whole tank for a high pick, and punt on another season for a high pick. And selling your fans on the idea of the timeline was SCAMMING.   Ryan McDonugh built a losing culture in the process or trying to hit the lotto, this was AWFUL for team morale.   Then.    James Jones came in, and changed the CULTURE by bringing in vets like Rubio, Dario, and Baynes and hiring someone with high character and high leadership.    None of that young players getting gifted minutes to develop.  You had to earn your minutes.   And James Jones doesn't put up with bad character players.  That's actually the main reason, he got rid of Josh Jackson.  Only high character guys on the Suns.   And James Jones makes sure he is on the same page with Devin Booker, but the final decision is all James Jones.   Booker wanted D'Lo, James Jones said no, because he wasn't a fan of the fit long term (probably).    James Jones and Monty Willams are on the same page, and james Jones is a 3 time Champ and knows CULTURE   And that is one think that Finch and Rosas will benefit from.   I say they should clean house with their roster, because KAT deserves better"
No a guy who might be Devin Booker one day possibly maybe.
Couple days ago he tweeted: “Devin Booker is the most disrespected player in our league!!! Simple as that.”
"I’m a huge Conley fan, and think he’s very underrated among people looking at the box score. But the reason he is so fantastic (and why he wasn’t great for most of last season), is because he’s a system player. Over time he figures out all the little things to do within the context of all his teammates’ attributes and shortcomings. He fills in all the space that’s left by more rigid players who don’t have the ability to modify their game to suit the situation. That’s why I want him on my team more than most allstars, but also why he doesn’t really fit the definition of an all star. I wish there was another way to recognize players that contribute like he does (or that teammate of the year awards and sportsmanship awards were more celebrated), but I don’t really have a problem with him not getting the nod as an all star. He probably wouldn’t be that great in an all star game anyway. Devin Booker is an immense offensive talent who’ll put on a display during the all star game, but I’ll take Conley on my team every day of the week."
And that's why he was in over Devin Booker.
"The problem is the narrative that Book couldn't get it before because of his seeding, and now they don't care about the Pelicans seeding. I see why Suns fans are annoyed. That's genuinely annoying and unfair.  But here's the flipside.  24-year-old Devin Booker isn't competing with 20-year-old (essentially in his rookie year in terms of games played) Zion Williamson. You'd be comparing 2015 Devin Booker to current Zion Williamson.  Was 2015 Devin Booker on a record list with Wilt Chamberlain and Kevin McHale? Was he often guarded by 4-5 guys because he was too difficult to stop? How much was he averaging PPG/APG when he had around 50 games under his belt?   Zion is an all-star because he's doing insane shit at his age."
"I think the Suns fans are mad about the goal post being moved all over the place for Devin but not other guys, but I also always assumed Devin was going to come in and replace AD so now we're just getting angry over whose name is called out first---which, my guess for why this happened is because Chris is also on All-Stars, and Suns have two guys, and that's why he got in as the replacement.  Also players acting outraged while completely knowing someone else was going to get in was suss. They 100% knew Booker had a good chance of getting in."
"This post, and the comments, really make me think Sabonis is the most overrated player in the league.  They are so much better when he’s on the bench, and people saying he’s better than Devin Booker are high."

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand foul baiting. The shot form is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical wrist flicking most of the shot arc will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the ref's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his officiating - his personal philosophy draws heavily from The NBA Official^TM 2020-21 NBA Rulebook literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these shots, to realize that they're not just 1 point- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike foul baiting truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the ref's existencial catchphrase ""Technical foul"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Adam Silver's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Devin Booker tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
The coaches spoon fed him? How could you say he got spoon fed? Tell me one fucking thing that Devin Booker does substantially better than Tatum does offensively. I’ll throw you a bone and not even bring up the defensive side of the game to make it kind of fair.
King Booker &gt; Devin Booker
Booker T Washington &gt; Devin Booker
"agreed, that 4 point play that was in favor of Devin Booker getting that unsuccessful challenge was ridiculous... I loathe it when Luka and Trae and Dame do it, I secretly cheered in surprise when it wasn't overturned... But Jae and Mikal were pretty awful on help D, and we just kept chucking up 3s when we made 8 of our first 9 and that killed us."
"I cannot believe how bad the calls were near the end.   Hayward being called for a foul leading to a Devin Booker 4pt play was ridiculous since Booker literally jumped into him &amp; elbowed him in the face.  Then that clearly should have been AT LEAST a jump ball if not Hornets ball, but it stayed with the suns.  Finally, Hayward definitely fouled Bookers last 3 point attempt and he should have gotten free throws but it wasn’t called or reviewed."
Lmfao the audacity of Devin Booker to bitch about a foul
Rookie of the Year and it's not even close   19 year old just stared down Chris Paul and Devin Booker in their building and beat em  Really wish the Warriors would have gotten him ... Him with the Warriors big 3 would have been a ton of fun (although the Hornets are really fun too)
now i regret saying devin booker was snubbed for all star
&gt; just cause he didn't originally make the all star game he's a bad player?  What the fuck are you talking about?  I mean why else would some lonely douche say some bitter shit like this:  &gt;Remember how Devin Booker had a top 10 game of all time dropping 70 and still lost  It must be because they totally have a fulfilling life I bet.  That same fool said “correct lol” when someone called Book a scrub.
This Zeeon guy is pretty good. Might be able to steal a few more ASGs from Devin Booker.
Trevor Booker &gt; Devin Booker
"Oh man read that as ""devin booker is dead"" had to do a double take"
Devin Booker was from Kentucky   Source: NBA 2k
So you're saying Devin Booker got the highest votes out of all the snubs in West? I found that hard to believe.
If you want to defend Devin Booker from random internet mob then enjoy your life
"Kobe is an all time great. If the point you’re trying to make is that a 20 year old Devin Booker is not as good as Kobe Bryant, then I fully agree with you"
Remember how Devin Booker had five coaches and 100 different teammates in five seasons
Remember how Devin Booker had a top 10 game of all time dropping 70 and still lost
"2x injury replacement All Star Devin Booker leaves Celery Stick Arena to put up more empty stats in Atlanta. Is he even a good basketball player or is CP3 carrying him? Before we continue, smash that bell and like button. It'd really help me out. In this video, I will demostra-"
The NBA announces Devin Booker will replace Anthony Davis in the All-Star Game next month.
No because it’s going to be Devin Booker.
"My point is if Mike Conley was the 1B to Devin Booker on the Suns, Booker would get the spot not him.  If Chris Paul was the 1B to Mitchell on the Jazz, Paul would get the spot"
"Chris Paul. I can’t believe how good he is still at this point in his career.   Without him it’s just Devin Booker dropping 40 in L’s again.   Not saying he’s carrying the team, they have a lot of talent. But none of it translates to actually winning games without CP."
Devin Booker is not better than Chris Paul...
"They have the same advanced stats. Chris has the better regular stats.  Also Conley isn't even the second best player on his team, whilst CP3 is obviously the best player on the suns. (FYI Devin Booker has a negative BPM, and pretty much half of CP3's winshares, and more turnovers lol)."
"Which is why we should remove East/West and just pick the 26 best players. Why do Randle, Brown, Vuc, Beal get to be an allstar but Devin Booker, who is leading his team to a 20-10 record, and averaging 25/4/4 doesnt? The Suns have a better record than every team in the East right now."
devin booker feels like hes been in the league for 10 years
ima say it devin booker is overrated he didn't deserve all star over the other western candidates CP3 is much more valuable to the Suns. his AST/TO ratio is not very good for a supposed good playmaker and his defense by most metrics is very very bad.
Devin booker over Zion
"I think trying to use things like player tracking in an advanced stat is really cool. That being said, I’m not sure if I’m putting a lot of merit into an advanced stat that ranks Bazemore ahead of people like, kyrie, devin booker, khris Middleton, Ben Simmons etc."
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
"Agreed. To add to that though, I just feel like Devin is one of those “great” scorers that doesn’t really impact the outcome of his teams. I think this year though that has changed as obviously he’s “winning” but I truly think it’s more of a Chris Paul effect rather than booker himself. Not to say booker is key. But still hard to say whether or not booker is just a scorer or the type of scorer that actually carries his team.  Zachs characteristics are different though. His demeanor in every point he scores has a true effect to the game and has more of a “I’m going to win this at all cost” mentality. I don’t know if that makes sense but thats the way I see it."
Team Lebron is down 15 heading into the 4th (cue background music and lights). Uh oh we have a surprise player joining the festivities! (Masked player slowly walks down ramp) Oh who could it be! (Slowly player takes off hood) OH MY GOD! ITS DEVIN BOOKER!
two weeks of them letting him run pick n rolls isn't more important than the fact he's supposedly the best player on a 13-17 team. personally. meanwhile guys like devin booker with Chris Paul and DeRozan are getting the ball in the clutch and winning the games for their teams. Conley is a much better two way player than Zion.
"Book’s still great though! I think the difference is that Lavine’s always been an underdog, Devin hasn’t. He’s been a media favorite since his second season. Yet he &amp; Booker have been in a similar range stats-wise the past few years, Lavine’s been on a much more dysfunctional, injurie-plagued squad.  They’re both incredible scorers, but this season, Lavine’s game is a bigger leap away from peers around his age like Booker, D-Lo, and Andrew Wiggins."
Yes I can tell you that a 9 time all nba defensive team player and one of the greatest scoring/passing point guards is the best player on the team. Get off Bookers cock and learn a thing or 2 about the game of basketball. Chris Paul is literally blowing Devin Booker out of the water in every advanced stat lmao.
Devin Booker. Should have made it over CP3 imo.
Devin Booker over Paul George  Trae Young over James Harden
"AChris Paul making the ASG doesn't mean the league isn't stacked, but there are multiple guys that deserve to make it over him. Devin booker got scammed for not making it, he's averaging 27 4 4 in their last 10 in which they won 9 and his efficiency was really good"
"Nah its not, there's multiple people I'd take over fox in the all star game this season, also citing purely box score oriented stats to bring up playmaking is just dumb, rpm and bpm do not accurately represent playmaking, all they know is raw assits and tos.  What you're ignoring is Raptor heavily favours devin booker offensively, and hes a way better scorer (no not a little bit).  Being league average efficiency on 22 points is good, being elite on 24 is great.  No I'm not going to admit it, i don't believe its true at all."
"Try Ryen Russilo fabricating the ""worst kept secret"" that Devin Booker wants out of Phoenix, try every ""The Jump"" segment where all the panel members make it a foregone conclusion that Devin Booker either wants to leave, is an empty stats player, or doesn't deserve to be an all-star"
"i never said Devin Booker didn’t deserve a spot when he was on a lottery team, i literally said if he was the best player on a 13 win team and outplayed the second best player in a 20 win team he should be in  so you clearly have the reading comprehension skills of a child"
[Finally found a way Devin Booker makes it to an ASG](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.barstoolsports.com/blog/754500/the-suns-devin-booker-has-a-70-point-game-and-a-massive-dick-like-a-poland-bottle-according-to-an-instagram-chick)
"Oh Lottery, aka the place the Devin Booker led Suns always are. Good thing he’s getting carried by CP3."
"What i’m saying is winning is part of what makes a player deserving, but a winning team shouldn’t count heavily towards every player on that team.   Zion is playing better than Devin Booker, Zion is the best player on his team, Booker isn’t the best performing player currently on his.   The Suns record already led to CP3 making the all star game, so the argument needs to be based on HIS performance. If the best player of a 13 win team is playing better than the second best player in a 20 win team then that first guy deserves to get in."
Because I think that Klay Thompson was better than Devin Booker?
"1) AS selections are DEFINITELY record based. Several players have been snubbed in the past based on team record, most notably Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker and Mike Conley. Middle of the pack records are often not rewarded with multiple selections even if they have good candidates.  2) Every team has had to deal with missing players, injuries, covid issues, rescheduling etc. That is now an excuse. Pacers didn't have Oladipo for a while, traded him, then lost Levert who they traded for. They still don't have Warren and lose Lamb too often. For that matter is mostly been Sabonis anchoring the team to a revised higher than the Celtics. 3) Sabonis is absolutely a player with All Star worthy stats. 21.5/11.6/5.7 is very much comparable to what Brown and Tatum are averaging. I like Brown and Tatum and I think they're having great years, but you're just stanning lol."
"As a fan i'd like to see some of these guys play. The All NBA / All Defense Teams are about awarding people. All Star Game is more about being fun.   Some guys left off, that definitely could be fun if they were involved. And Conley constantly getting left off through his career.  * Trae Young * DeMar Derozan * Domantas Sabonis * Tobias Harris * Devin Booker * Mike Conley * De’Aaron Fox"
Was Devin Booker not selected? The fuck
Shut up Devin Booker
Personally I would take Trae over Ben Simmons but I’m not really mad at the picks this year.  I feel bad for Devin Booker
East:  Trae Young  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton  Domantas Sabonis  Bam Adebayo  West:  De'Aaron Fox  Devin Booker  DeMar DeRozan  Brandon Ingram   Christian Wood
"No Devin Booker? Wow. 🙄🙄 The guy's putting 25, 4 and 4 on a nightly basis, just to get snubbed like this. :("
Derozan is a much better all around player and he’s leading the Spurs to the 6th seed while the kings aren’t even close to .500 Devin Booker is a  better player on a better team
Devin Booker getting snubbed would a shocker smh.
"I’m from Lexington and it seems to happen every year that a UK player goes either late In the lottery or first round because they didn’t shine in Coach Cal’s system, then they blossom in the NBA. Some recent examples include Bam, Shai, Tyler Herro, devin Booker, Jamal Murray, and hell even Tyrese, Quickley, and maybe even Hamidou."
"I love Devin Booker but I just don't see the potential in this team. I don't like that their big move was to go after a 35 year old with an extensive injury history. I don't see Paul playing almost every game like last season because that feels as rare as halley's comet.   Even though the Suns have had a strong start, I am still very skeptical because A) they started strong last season and B) there is an argument that Mikal Bridges has been their best player this season. While Bridges is a baller, Booker needs to be this teams best player and he hasn't been that."
"Looking at the stats, is Devin Booker shooting every time he touches the ball? He has no assists. I see he has 28 pts on 50% shooting but he also has a team low +/-, so I'm curious if the offense hasn't gotten a chance to get going  Edit: I'm wrong. Ayton has the worst plus minus. But they're both really bad."
Just like Devin Booker last season right?
"Hmm. If we’re truly saying like no defense at all, that’s hard to find. People like Luka had atleast an inkling of defense within them.  But:  Trae Young/Devin Booker/Andrew Wiggins/Kevin Love/Thomas Bryant"
"&gt; Usually in the cases such as the Magic and Grizzlies there is a statistical anomaly such as teams shooting a poor percentage on wide open 3s. There isn’t anything like that with the Suns this year, they’ve been playing really solid defense and executing extremely well on offense.  This is literally exactly what Suns fans said last year after your hot start.  ""We aren't winning because hot shooting, it's our defense so it's sustainable!!"".  Shocker, it wasn't.     &gt; What’s laughable is a Blazers fan pretending to know anything about “proving themselves”.  One, the idea that which team you support is somehow related to basketball knowledge is stupid, and only stupid people try to argue like that.    Two, the Blazers for all their failings have made the playoffs 7 years in a row in the West.  You have had Devin Booker for 6 years and he's never played a playoff game.  Sure though, keep celebrating your 10 game win loss record!"
Hopefully it will long term but it sure as hell hasn’t rubbed off on Devin Booker so far this year.
"The new devin booker  Poor bastard, get this man a squad"
"Weird question, but are you a gamer as well? Ps5/Xbox series x, PC? Is anyone on your team into online gaming? I’m a big suns fan and Devin booker and Deandre Ayton are big gamers, you look like you can be a sniper in call of duty.   Also, last thing... please tell deandre Ayton to dunk the ball when you  play against us, or maybe after the game let him know that he’s 7 feet tall and it’s ok to do so."
"Yeah I guess my point is about the idea of those OCs not catching on. Its not anything unique to /r/nba I’ve said this before on here I know a couple people who write for the athletic who’ve told me internally there has kind of been some subtle pressure to move away from/reduce the number of “film room” or Xs and Os type pieces because those just don’t get traffic at all from what they told me.   I agree tons of fans here are just casuals here for the memes and chaos not actual analysis which is fine. But it also leads to some of the inherent problems people complain about here. At the end of day this site is an embodiment of what the higher ups at the athletic are talking about. The top posts on here are highlights, rumors or drama type stories. One of the most common occurrences on here is to a thread of “Ryan Rusillo says Devin Booker is already unhappy in Phoenix” and for most of the comments to be saying this is all bullshit or shitting on the source....and yet the thread will have thousands of upvotes."
"Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton, poor man's addition"
"KAT has the talent and skills to be the best offensive player in the league but he is not a leader. He just doesn't have that quality, same with AD, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, and AD. Kentucky, or John Calipari to be more accurate, doesn't teach kids to lead."
"Eh, to be fair it's like 0.7 more points, 1.7 more rebounds, 1.7 more assists, and 0.4 more steals.   Most of the advanced stats on bbref are just combinations of box stats so having higher pts/reb/ast would put him ahead. Outside of FT% the efficiency stats all favor Klay.    Definitely given Ray's longevity he's way ahead, but if we're just comparing their first 8 years I think most people would give the edge to Klay given the fact that their stats are incredibly close, but Klay has had more playoff success and is the better defender.   Remember by year 8 Ray had been mostly on 8 seeds with first round exits. There are a lot of solid SGs in the league that put up better or at least comparable stats to Klay (his career ppg is 19.5, good but nothing insane) but until guys like Devin Booker make some deep deep playoff runs people aren't going to consider them better all time than Klay."
"It's hard to say because I feel like what seperates stars and Superstars is consistent performance.      We've seen how good guys like Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum and others can be when they're at their best and it's comparable with top tier players but the best of the best just do it more frequently."
formerly devin booker too
*cries in Devin Booker*  Though Ingram had made the game in identical circumstances so who knows...
"CJ McCollum  is averaging 28/4/5  while shooting 44% on 11 3PA and this dude has De'Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and frickin Shai Alexander above him on his list."
"Whenever Trae and Devin Booker play bad, I feel so vindicated for hopping on the hate train early for them."
"Now is the time to jump on the Suns bandwagon. We're historically a winning team, but the 2010's were very unkind to us. We have, however, taken great strides to turn that around, and I think we've got a lot going for us now.  1) A young star player in Devin Booker that shows improvement every single year (though he's off to a slow start this year) and has shown incredible loyalty and passion to the city/fans.  2) One of the most talented and respected vets in the league in Chris Paul, who people call the Point God for a reason.  3) A high energy young core of players that give it all on offense and defense, ranging from respectable role players to potential All-Stars down the line, in Mikal, Ayton and Cam Johnson.  4) A scrappy bench mob consisting of Cam Payne, Jevon Carter, Dario Saric, and Langston Galloway that is just smothering on defense and lethal on offense  5) An endearing and respectable head coach in Monty Williams.  Biggest drawback is our owner is a cheap bastard with a history of meddling where he shouldn't. Lately though, he's been much quieter and hands off while our new GM, James Jones, has turned our trashcan fire of the 2010's completely around and created a very strong, balanced, and deep team. Things are looking these days, so why not praise the Suns?"
"If your two stars combine for 25 and the team still wins it is probably a sign that the team is actually good and not a fluke.  I also don’t get why people are so hesitant to expect a lot from the Suns. CP3 already got 5th seed with Thunder. Surely devin fucking booker, ayton, and bridges are considerable upgrades."
"LMAO. Now you're saying Huerter, Reddish, Collins and Dedmon were scrubs? gtfoh, remember when THJ was just a throw in in that KP trade? When Kleber was unknown? When DFS sucks and KP was coming off an ACL injury? Luka's teammates weren't a whole lot better than Trae's teammates, it's just that Luka makes his teammates better. THJ and Burke just scored a combined 65 points yesterday in their game against Orlando. BURKE AND HARDAWAY JR. Admit it. As much as talented Trae is he will never be a winning player unless he changes the way he plays. (i.e. Devin Booker who is now learning how to play to win and not just to shine)"
"Jeez that really puts into perspective how competitive the West is, especially in the guard position.   It seems as the league is getting more and more stacked there are gonna be tons of guys getting left off putting up like 22 ppg on good efficiency. Or if you’re Bradley Beal. Dude averaged over 30 ppg last season and was the 2nd highest scorer after Harden iirc and was left off. Meanwhile Devin Booker was whining about getting left off and only got in because Dame got injured lol."
"The fact is....he is gaurding teams best player... He matched up with LeBron, Paul George, Devin Booker and some other guys.."
Devin Booker
"As a fan of a franchise that drafted Mario Hezonja 6 spots head of Devin Booker, I agree."
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
"39 points on 33 shots isn't AWESOME if you're, like, donovan mitchell or devin booker. 39 on 33 is fucking incredible for a late first round rookie making his first start as the guy getting the most defensive attention. wild statistical line to see from him in this one."
over the last few years it's been said a lot about Devin Booker and Trae Young.  Booker's gonna shed that label this year. If Atlanta makes the playoffs i'd think Trae will too.
"Ben Gordon - I thought he would be what Beal and Devin Booker are right now. I was actually pretty thrilled that he was signing with the Pistons, after his playoff performances for the Bulls. He wasn't at that level though, and the Pistons were in a bad spot, in terms of roster construction and coaching turnover.  Trey Burke - I thought he was very good at U of M. It took him a while to get going in the NBA though, where he's productive, but not the star that I envisioned.  Kenneth Faried - I didn't see him in college, but I saw some of the things he could do as a young NBA player. Then, he showed out on USA's FIBA team in 2014. I was thoroughly convinced that Faried was a star in the making, at least on the defensive side of the ball.   Then, as I noticed he was losing minutes in Denver's rotation, I started reading up what Denver fans were saying, and it wasn't really matching what I thought about him. He had great physical talent, but that was pretty much it"
"Was though, the suns didn’t win over 30 games with devin booker until this past season."
KAT? Trae Young? Devin Booker? Elite players on bad teams that are widely considered top 20 players. Beal wasn’t even an all-star.

"I retract my earlier statement claiming that Devin Booker is better than Donovan Mitchell, the events that transpired at Little Caesars in Detroit on Friday evening is unacceptable"
"You forgot Jamal Murray (Jokic) , Devin Booker (CP3).. Both those guys are over Porzingis at least. And I'm not so sure Beal is the second option in Washington. I'd probably rather have him taking the last shot than Westbrook"
This is more impressive than Devin Booker being +14 in 45 min a loss
"I'm happy for them being good, no more Devin Booker only puts up empty stats comments hopefully"
Devin Booker
"Where’s this excuse for Jamal murray, devin Booker, Mitchell? It’s obvious that most scoring guards in the league aren’t good defenders, especially when their offensive load is that high. But when they have solid defenders around them then they can contribute with at least neutral defense."
Devin Booker 70 point game. The suns ended up with 120 total
Devin booker.
Devin Booker.  He brought the Suns into existence of no longer being a lottery team.
"Devin Booker, they're pretty much similar everywhere else but Booker's a better playmaker"
Devin Booker.
"Lmao right, he definitely hasn’t watched basketball past the last couple years. Him saying his playoff success was only in the east is completely ignoring that he was going back and forth with lebron and took him to game 7 in the conference finals. Not to mention that was before he lost a year of his career to a gruesome leg injury. Meanwhile Devin Booker has never even made the playoffs."
Devin Booker. A kid who has not a played a single playoff game in his life.

Devin Booker is a Lakers fan? 👀
"LeBron turned an entire city, his hometown no less, against him with The Decision in 2010. Hell a lot of people's opinions on LeBron soured from that.  Then the choke job in the 2011 Finals gave the entire world ammo to fire at him because he formed a super-team only to shit the bed once he got to the Finals.   Devin Booker calling PG soft ain't shit compared to that lmao"
"Lmao if he thinks Devin Booker calling him soft is bad, imagine if PG had to deal with someone like Gary Payton every night who will keep yapping at him from tip-off until the final buzzer  GP might actually cause the mf to retire on the spot"
"The only reason PG has had more playoffs success is because of his team. Yes, PG was and still is a good player, but don't make it seem like he carried the Pacers. If PG was in the same position as Devin Booker is, then he wouldn't have made the playoffs either."
Devin Booker in shambles.
Article turns into shit when it talks about Devin Booker. like wtf was that? saying soft is crossing the line now?
"I mean, it's the highest scoring game since Devin Booker three and a half years ago. I hate to say it, but that two points really does make a difference. Steph became the second oldest player to score sixty points in a game behind Kobe's last game, one of three active players to get to 62 (Anthony 62, Booker 70), a more efficient 60 pt game than Booker, Dame, Harden, Beal, etc. He also did it on 50/50/90. ALSO, HE WON. It was statistically just a much better and more important game than Beal's."
"Steph won the game, Beal didn't. I think it is as simple as that. Why nobody gives a shit to the 73 points of Devin Booker?"
"""Can't choke in the playoffs if you never make it.""   -Devin Booker, tapping head"
"Devin Booker also called him a ""soft ass n----"" in a game recently"
"I agree. I mean look at Devin Booker's 70 points, they never talked about it,,   When someone is reaching 60, they always talked about  kobe 81 like comon  booker got 70, why not talk about reaching 70 pts first"

Devin booker has left the chat
"I agree. Hoping we get a good draft pick that will light it up next year when fans can go see the team next year.  In the meantime, I will be obviously rooting for a Raptors win tonight, but if not, I'm fine with the Suns being a top-seeded team with a deep playoff run this season. Devin Booker and Chris Paul deserve it."
"it sucks dude. Beal went from being considered one of the best young guys in the league to being a loser who puts up empty stats. The only thing that's changed is that Beal's team sucks ass.   Same thing happened with Devin Booker, but in reverse"
Im still surprised he didnt at least become the wing version of Stanley Johnson. Cant shoot a lick not someone you want ever creating but an awesome defender who hangs in the league that way.   Zach Lowe said on draft night that year Detroit internally was down to either Devin Booker or Stanley Johnson for the pick when they were on the clock. That type of decision can define your fate and future for teams in undesirable markets for FAs
Ignore him he’s the same guy who made multiple posts criticizing AD and when I called him out about it he says “oh AD is one of my favorite players it’s a compliment I’m comparing him to Devin Booker !!” It’s clear he just dislikes AD lol
"It's actually true of Devin Booker's entire career when looking at it.  In his 5-season career (entering this season), Booker is at 2.0 makes per game and 35.4% shooting. In the last 5 seasons, LeBron is at 1.7 makes per game and 34.7% shooting.  It does seem as if a lot of people view Devin Booker as some elite sniper, but he's barely better than LeBron, who is seen as just an okay three-point shooter at best. And you can't even really make the shot type argument, since it's not like LeBron is just taking wide open catch-and-shoot corner threes."
"Impact metrics hate LaVine. I can't tell you *why* they view his scoring as only a moderate positive and think he gives all his value back on the other end, or claim that the assessment is accurate, only that it is the assessment. Devin Booker got similar treatment for years. Also, a fair number of impact metric databases haven't been updated with 2020 data, so they might have simply missed LaVine's improvement."
People think Devin Booker is some big time 3-point shooter for some reason.
Because Devin Booker was 10 and 0 in the bubble. Paul George was pathetic p in the bubble.
soft  regards  Devin booker
How would Chris Paul make devin booker turn the ball over less
"Nobody cares about pickup games you play with random bums. We’re talking about basketball at the highest level, and on this level an offence that has role players attempt a high volume of mid-range shots is gonna suck and be competent unable to keep up with teams that actually play correctly.   Sure, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker can take a lot of them because they’re actually good shooters. Danny Green and Robert Covington and like 90% of role players should be shooting threes or layups almost exclusively because 40% mid-range shooting is terrible."
"When Devin booker leaves the Suns to link with his friends, KAT and Russell"
"Empty stats are when someone is putting up shiny box score stats, but is highly inefficient. Examples are Tony Wroten, Jerry Stackhouse, MCW (rookie season), etc.  The “empty stats” narrative is by far the most lazy accusation in bball. Devin Booker, AD, and Trae Young were all accused of it simply because of their team’s record."

Devin Booker is beloved by most and can’t do no wrong  Paul George has been putting his foot in his mouth so naturally everyone memes him to death and everyone here thinks they’re straight up Dave Chapelle every time Perplexed Pandemic Pediatric Pepperoni P jokes come up
"UK guards drafted since 2010:  2010: John Wall, Eric Bledsoe  2011: Brandon Knight, Josh Harrellson, Deandre Liggins  2012: Marquis Teague, Doron Lamb  2013: Archie Goodwin  2015: Devin Booker, Andrew Harrison  2016: Jamal Murray, Tyler Ulis  2017: De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk  2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Hamidou Diallo  2019: Tyler Herro  2020: Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley"

Trae Young   Devin Booker   Paul George   Ben Simmons    Karl Anthony Towns      I think it's possible but unlikely
Hey u/TheRealDevDev and u/d4nowar  I'm thinking of trading Devin Booker - any way you guys would include Nurkic in trade talks?? I know it's a hefty ask.
"The only player in the league right now who has ever had a higher scoring game is Devin Booker.  That's it.  Not LeBron, not Harden, not KD, not anybody else but Devin Booker.  It was kind of impressive, you know?"
"I can definitely see someone surpassing 81 points in the next few years. Devin Booker scored 70 points recently, and his teammates were just shoveling him the ball so he could reach that milestone.   I think 90 is the limit because once someone reaches that plateau, the other team is looking to take him out of the game. No one wants to be associated with getting 100 points dropped on them."
"I'm not the biggest oh fan of PG but Devin Booker, a guy who has never won a playoff game acting likes hes somehow an alpha dog was kind of hilarious"
Devin Booker was always someone that balled and showed his talent but had blasphemy because he ain't lebron tier or Harden where he can drag sorry teams or actively make players much better.  Also he was tethered to trae as bad team good stats last season.
"On behalf of Clipper Nation, I would like to extend a warm ""thank you"" to Devin Booker for calling Paul George a, and I quote: ""Bitch ass n$$$$r"" during such a critical moment of the game.  Thank you, kind sir, without your contribution this team would have folded."

"This game was basically swung on a 19-0 run to start the second without Devin Booker, Suns made sure [to do a tribute to vintage old school Suns basketball during that stretch](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq9z6l/against_the_clippers_last_night_devin_booker_was/gi2kfs9/)  That Phoenix opponent 3 point shooting luck regresses kinda hard last night   Heat check Paul George game [lot of it was just him flexing like this](https://go.nba.com/21z4) not much you can do. This isn’t a good matchup for Phoenix because they lack too many wings you are comfortable putting on Paul George and kawhi beyond crowder and Bridges. The guy who honestly did the best job on PG last night was maybe Chris Paul which isn’t ideal. Bookers defense has been better this year [but he isn’t ready for this responsibility chasing guys through screens isn’t his strength](https://go.nba.com/14n8) neither is reacting quickly in space [and rotating](https://go.nba.com/n19p)  This was interesting there was atretch in the 4th last quarter last night you look up and you see......small ball center Kawhi Leonard as the Clippers lineup [taking away that rim from Cameron Payne](https://go.nba.com/troi). Something you’ll see in the playoffs maybe   Response was pretty cool from Phoenix Saric helped lead the comeback at the end of the 3rd. Bridges and Crowder did what you want vs Kawhi Leonard he wasn’t getting to the basket a ton. Suns didn’t get great offensive looks in the half court last 5 min when it wasn’t Booker pushing off misses that helped seal it."

Devin Booker played 44:40 in a 48-minute game and was +14.  He also lost the game by 5.  **what**
Known tough guy Devin Booker
But not Devin Booker
"David Robinson, MJ, Jerry West and Devin Booker immediately come to mind."
Devin booker thinks he's hard lol
Fun stat:  Devin Booker played almost 45 minutes tonight.  He was +14.  The Suns were -19 in the 3 minutes he sat.
I mean he's just like Trae Young or Devin Booker now. The Warriors might be worse teams overall than both now.
"Players near that level that dont seem guaranteed to stay on their team are  Zach Lavine &amp; Bradley Beal  \---  Some ""big names"" that may move:  John Collins  Kyle Lowry  Victor Oladipo  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley        \---  No major issue/fit, but could see teams asking about;  Lamarcus Aldridge  Devin Booker  Pascal Siakam  Buddy Hield  \---       Doubtful, but could see being surprising moves given team outlooks of assets/health/success:  KAT  Curry/Klay"
"Man its surreal to think about someone scoring 81 points in a game, and i watched it on television.  Always thought Klay Thompson or Devin Booker would go close."
How ? He shot more threes than Devin Booker last year and made a higher percentage.
"Sorry, Devin Booker isn’t leading a team to a championship right now. Maybe a few years later, but not now"
"oh true of course, my bad. so zion sucks hey, because he hasn't made a playoffs yet.  and ja morant sucks, because he hasn't either.  oh and KAT is a bust, because he's only been once in five seasons.   oh damn devin booker? he really sucks."
"because we’re in a thread talking about guys who are good enough at offence that it makes up for their defence.  guys like booker and lavine. and for some reason you bring up an example of a dude who isn’t good enough at offence for it to make up for his defence, like you’re making some sort of point lol.   yes, this player exists? congrats i guess? good thing he is not zach lavine or devin booker. 2 dudes who defensive deficiencies can be made up for.   but hey maybe you know better than every single coach in the nba rn."
"Brother behind James Harden, Beal is the second best 2 gaurd right now followed by Devin booker at 3, CJ McCollum at 4, Jaylen Brown at 5,  Middleton at 6. Even tho Middleton is playing as a 3 he’s really a 2."
"&gt;**Empty stats is such a dumb term**. People said the same thing about Devin Booker and they put a competent roster and coach next to him and the narrative changed.  Oh really? His stats went down. He's averaging the lowest pts since his rookie year. The prolific scorer is doing only 22 a game. His efficiency isn't up. He's handling the ball less, but he's only shooting 1-2 less per game than he used to.   Your example of Booker literally supports everything about the empty stats argument.  No offense to Booker, I love the player. You just forced me to have to argue this."
ah yes the devin booker argument.
Empty stats is such a dumb term. People said the same thing about Devin Booker and they put a competent roster and coach next to him and the narrative changed.
This team will only become legit if Devin Booker starts playing like Devin Booker. Is he just being affected by the Kardashian curse right now?

Devin Booker got a big duck
Would’ve thought Devin Booker for Michigan...
" Devin Booker Moss Point, MS"
Devin Booker grew up in Michigan. Are we purposely putting Draymond over Booker?
"I was almost flabbergasted by the Mississippi choice....but Devin Booker wasn't born there. So shoot, this thread is the ultimate ""damn you got me!"""
Isn’t Devin Booker from Grand Rapids? Surely he’s better active than Draymond?
How is Devin Booker not better than Draymond currently?
"&gt; AD is demonstrably better than Cleveland Kyrie, let’s not try to make that argument. 2016 Lebron was the carry job of the century, Lebron-AD is not a Batman-Robin duo, they’re a 1A-1B.  That's not the argument I was making.  I'm laughing about these phrases people attach to players that have nothing to do with the player and everything to do with their situation. I bet you used to call Donovan Mitchell a winning player and Devin Booker an empty stats guy too, huh?   &gt; The Harden Rockets were a failed experiment.  Ha again, such a simplistic view.  THe Rockest took arguably the greatest team to ever exist to 7, and were a CP3 injury away from likely beating them. The only thing separating James Harden from finals appearances was the conference he played in."
"Devin Booker is better than Draymond, unless you meant career stats until this point in which case then you’re absolutely right."
He’s not a starting lead guard in the nba. He can’t run pick and roll bc he can’t shoot or drive. His passing skills are irrelevant without those other skills.   I could put money he won’t be an all star level player...Devin booker barely made it last year come on now
"I love BI so I hope we can just shove as many good shooters around Zion/BI as possible. BI needs space to slash too.  So maybe some Devin Booker types, a Tyrese Haliburton-type (who can shot create for others and hit shots,) etc."
I think a better comparison would be devin booker and ayton
"Paul George is an MVP candidate type of player, no one else on that list is close to that. I think Booker is the best of the rest, while the other 3 are all similar and can be swapped in any order.  1. Paul George  2. Devin Booker  3. Ben Simmons  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Donovan Mitchell"
Paul George  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  JB  Ben Simmons
"I can’t put Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Karl Anthony Towns or Devin Booker above him. His numbers have been better than all of them this season, and he just came off a impressive playoff run, so it’s probably sustainable"
He’s averaging 24/6/5 on 50/50/90 shooting. He’s absolutely better than Devin Booker.
Devin Booker is somewhere sweating.
Its found its way too Devin Booker now.
"Monroe was solid for us too bad he is playing in Russia with Alexy shved, Bertrans brother and Devin booker."
Clippers got the saltiest post of Devin Booker in the last hour smh
"He's definitely not going to be an allstar. Devin Booker couldn't get in for ages because of team record, and Beal missed out last season for the same reason, there's no exception for someone like Wood."
Devin Booker
CP3 is washed and old. Can't beat anyone off the dribble. Devin Booker should be in his prime right now...
Devin Booker doesn’t care about black people

Devin booker looking like Jose Calderon tonight
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
"No one hates the Kings, it's just y'all are a small market team in the western conference that hasn't made the playoffs in a really long time. The NBA wants to flaunt and advertise its best players and best teams since this is what people crave.   A lot of people know about Devin Booker or Luka Doncic, not so many know about Buddy Hield or Marvin Bagley, and so it's in the NBA's best interest to advertise those teams"
"I can't remember where I read it, but I think the issue was ego/talent. He went to a team with Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. That team also eventually acquired Isaiah Thomas and Devin Booker. He was a young player on a team with established guards and then a franchise guy. I think he didn't appreciate his role or minutes. Lots of talented guys wash out of the league because they don't understand how to stick. I also remember him not being able to really shoot, so it probably contributed to his leaving the NBA."
"""despite the loss, Devin Booker had 70/8/6 on .680 TS"" is an actual thing and that's wild"
Lmao this isn’t even a debate. This is like debating “would you rather have Lebron or Devin Booker and Mikal Bridges”
"He also shot a higher percentage than Devin Booker... Point being initially is that Trae doesn’t take the best shots at time, which he will no doubt grow out of.  He is without a doubt a better shooter.  It’s utterly stupid and generally facetious to say that Lonzo is actually a better shooter than either of those players."
That team is STACKED lowkey. Chris Paul Devin Booker Mikal Bridges. That's great
Devin Booker
"Trae easily. Dude is getting the Devin Booker treatment at the moment since his team underachieved last year, but he's a top 20 player right now, and should only improve. He's only 1 year older than Ja so it's not like we're comparing a 25 year old to a 21 year old.  Also you can tell a lot about a poster if they call Trae inefficient. Even shooting way below his normal level, he's at 54.1 TS% (which is within a point or two of league average I think) since he gets a ton of FTs and hits them at 89%, that's the most efficient thing you can do as a scorer.   We're 12 games in- his 3-ball will recover, and he'll make it back to his elite TS% from last year."
"Devin Booker,Klay Thompson,Kobe Bryant"
Devin Booker still hasn't been a non-replacement lol
Devin Booker  Kobe Bryant  Larry Bird  Chris Bosh  Charles Barkley
"Suns I got Chris paul, devin booker, deandre ayton. They're a decent team this season it's my memory that is trash"
You ever seen people clamoring for Dame to be more like Steph? How about Beal? Kyrie? KD? Devin Booker?
"The sheer number of talented, productive guards in the West right now is insane. Understanding that SGA is the clear alpha on a team tanking (well, supposed to be tanking LOL), you have production lines that are right up there with the guys most would have penciled in to be All Stars at the start of the season.   Unless I missed a change to All Star lineups, at MOST the West can name 6 backcourt players to the roster. It's going to be a travesty that a minimum of THREE of these guys are going to be snubbed this year:  Steph Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Devin Booker Chris Paul Donovan Mitchell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander CJ McCollum Mike Conley"
Like Devin Booker?

People taking Devin Booker because of defense is hilarious since when did he come an elite defender lol give me Trae
Devin Booker is d better player between d two.
"Devin Booker isn’t ugly, so him"
Not even going to bother to read this shit. I'd take Devin Booker in a heartbeat RIGHT NOW.
"Live in New Zealand, devin Armani booker"
"Devin Booker was a bench player who averaged 10 points, 2 rebounds, 1 assist.  Bam was a hyped recruit who was talked about as being a top pick in his eventual draft, then disappointed in college and ended up being drafted 14th."
"Sounds like a sound strategy, a list of UK players who have flashed or are showing flashes of being great in the past 5 years.

"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
You don't trade your team's GOAT for a measly Devin Booker
1 Devin Booker /s
"Smart and snarky comment!   Which is why you see superteams forming to beat Bradley Beal and Devin Booker right?  If the nets win the chip will your reaction be “ good players can win games, more news at 10”"
"fking lol devin booker is not even the same tier as harden, kyrie, kd. he's actually 2-3 teirs below that"
Devin booker calling people a soft ass ni\*\*a is super professional
No he's Devin Booker and MJ is MJ.
And Devin Booker is Devin Booker whereas Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan. Look up the definition of nuance smooth brain.
Devin Booker scored 70 points. Is he a better scorer than MJ
Devin Booker higher career high than Bird  Better player.
"In the season opener they actually put PJ on Dame Lillard for a couple of key poss at the end of the 4th and OT. Last poss [of that game he looks pretty good on here doing it](https://go.nba.com/hl3q).   Hou has asked him to play as a big the last 2 years but in 2019 googling his matchup tab here are the guys he spent the most time guarding: Paul George, LeBron, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard. If you go down youll see him having games of guarding 2's like Victor Oladipo, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine etc for 8-10 poss a game they really had him do it 2-5.  His best matchups are probably 3s and 4s. Every one of those wings I mentioned above I would trust to put on him unless he were to suddenly start showing his age over night."
What basketball law says so?   The dudes never missed the playoffs and Devin Booker never made the playoffs so maybe he’s good in a unique way where he doesn’t need to shoot
"then why doesn't dame also demand a trade to PHI, BKN, or LAL? or devin booker? or any of the other superstars who aren't on teams that can compete for a ring"
"Lol, I wouldn't trade THT for Trae or Harden if I were the Lakers, tbh. Devin Booker is in a little slump, but he is easily the gem of the players you listed."
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"

"Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Zach LaVine, Michael Porter Jr, Sabonis, Bam Adebayo, SGA all picked past 10. Nowadays with all the young talent coming in, drafts are deep. This isn’t 2001"
"Struggling to think of anyone who's been as awful in the impact metrics as Wiseman this season, and became a ""dominant"" player. The closest is Devin Booker who still has flaws in his game despite being an All Star, not someone I would describe as consistently elite. And Booker's year 1 still looked better than what Wiseman is doing."
Jamal Murray. Nugs are a bottom 10 team without Jokic but since Jokic is on the team Murray is seen as one of the leaders of a championship contending team. Without playing next to Jokic hed be seen as good but still worse than a Zach Lavine or devin booker and def wouldn’t have been paid a max deal and probably traded multiple times for being an idiot
*monkey's paw curls*  Karl Anthony Towns and Devin Booker lead the Beijing Ducks to their 4th consecutive championship.
Who or what is Devin Booker defending exactly?
"Whenever Bill Simmons, Zach Lowe, or other popular basketball podcasters bring up a discussion point or argument, people will come on here and make posts about the subject.   For example, when Bill Simmons talked about Devin Booker not being a winning player last year, I remember a few days where Devin Booker was the most discussed player on this subreddit."
"What is this mediocre efficiency you speak of, because it certainly doesn’t refer to Devin booker who has been above average true shooting since 2017 and well above average since 2018"

Devin Booker&gt;CP3 for MVP
you misspelled Devin Booker
devin booker is a glorified desmond mason
Devin Booker is built for the playoffs. People don’t realize because the Suns have sucked so bad but I don’t be surprised when Booker takes over in the playoffs. Having CP3 around him will also do wonders for him especially with this being his 1st time going. Scary to think that he’s still only 24

&gt; Couldn't be me  Looks at post history..  &gt; FUCK DEVIN BOOKER OUR LIGHTSKIN SHOOTING GUARD IS BETTER  &gt; Seriously fuck Devin Booker
"So, Devin Booker was just a lowly SG before CP3 was dealt over, huh?"
Gordon Hayward vs Devin Booker is the matchup we all need but didn't know it.
"Everyone is so quick to jump the gun and be worried about losing Tatum and Brown, when they are 23 and 24. Is Miami going to be worried about losing Bam if they lose in the first or second round this year? Is Sacramento worried about losing De'Aaron Fox since he was also just signed to a 5-year max and they can't put help around him? Is Ben Simmons going to demand a trade if they don't make the finals yet again? Same for Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz don't win this year? What about Sabonis or Devin Booker?  All of these guys are the same ages as Tatum/Brown, but I never hear this narrative about them, except maybe Simmons in trade rumors, and they all haven't won a championship yet either.  Everyone said the same thing about Giannis and then he stayed in Milwaukee. I understand where it comes from when it does happen and guys want out, I just don't know what kind of power they have with 3/4 years left on $24M+ deals where any trade to match salary would send them to a bad team or a contender would be losing key pieces to match salary and they'd be in the exact same spot in a different location. Celtics aren't buying them out lol.  They have literally no leverage to demand a trade this offseason and if you make the playoffs 4 years in a row and made it to the ECF in 2/4 of those where you're the main guy(s), why would you want out that bad?  James Harden spent 8 years in Houston. KD spent 9 in OKC. LeBron stuck it out with the Cavs for 7. Paul George in Indiana for 7. AD with the Pelicans for 7. Melo with Denver for 7.5. Lillard has spent his entire career with Portland. Embiid has played 5 season with the Sixers and there's no mention of him jumping ship. Jokic 6 years in Denver and no one is saying he's going to demand a trade. None of these guys won championships with those teams.  Why does everyone act like their window is closed now or very soon after just 4 years when people act like their help (Kemba Walker, 4 time All-Star, coming back from injury/surgery. Marcus Smart, 1st team All Defense, coming back from injury. Evan Fournier, 18 PPG scoring option, 2 games in) is no help at all? This narrative is nonsense."

"I think Westbrook has the media and the fans confused as the same all encompassing entity, when in reality it's 2 different worlds he's speaking on, with 2 different agendas. The media are the ones who WANT the superteams to form so they can milk the fuck out of covering them. It's the FANS who(mostly) don't like that shit and disrespect players for ring chasing blatantly. The media couldn't give 2 shits aside from a few people.   Shit, half of the NBA's media consists of clueless jackasses sitting around shit talking good players for being on bad teams and coming up with ridiculous fake trade rumors and reasons why those players ""should leave and go join a contender because they're never going to win staying on the team they're on"". Us Suns fans had to deal with that BS for years. Shit even just a few weeks ago I saw a video from ESPN of some dipshits talking about how Devin Booker should force a trade to the Knicks. Like what fuck fuck??? Lmao.   It doesn't matter that the Suns are a contender now. The media will never give Booker credit for staying loyal with his team for the tough times, with the franchise trying to build around him year after year, and finally becoming a contender fighting for the top record in the whole league. Only true NBA fans respect loyalty anymore.   We know it's better for the league to be balanced. Parity makes the league more entertaining, and makes it easier to keep fans of losing teams still having the desire to keep watching. There's nothing worse of being a fan of a rebuilding team, struggling just to overpay for mediocre players to come to your team, meanwhile some team that's already stacked is getting great players coming there left and right and taking less money. It's so fucking whack, and it can be easy to give up and quit watching knowing that their team can never compete with that."
devin booker.... good?
"Trae Young probably won’t get all nba this year, for 1 it’s rare you get an all nba team without making all star(same reason Bradley put up 30 last season and was ignored), Devin Booker has inferior stats to Kyrie. While games played do matter many people have missed lots of time and still gotten in. Zach Lavine and Kyrie also have pretty even stats, the second factor is Kyrie plays on a winning team"
"Depending on how far you wanna go back, I’d go Sixers.   For this exercise, I’m assuming only they get the power of foresight. Just for a quick primer, not getting to deep into late picks and such:  Draft Devin Booker instead of Jahlil Okafor  Draft Tatum at 1, or trade back from 3 with Sacramento for 5 and 10 (was a rumored possibility at the time) and take 2 of Fox/Mitchell/Bam.  And then instead of drafting Zhaire Smith, draft SGA.  Additionally, they’d retain some selection of Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, Covington, Saric, etc. to fill out the team with those new guys, Ben, and Joel."
Devin Booker?
"Damian Lillard, Devin Booker, Paul George, Jaylen Brown, and Myles Turner.  That's a mighty fine team in my opinion."
"Overrated is difficult, because many NBA reporters point such declines out relatively fast and, like with Kawhi or Lebron in prior seasons, it is sometimes just star players saving energy.   My pick for most overrated is actually a great defender, who also gets a lot of amazing help defense from his teammates and whose defensive impact gets overrated, because many people believe perimeter defense is really important:   Ben Simmons, who some demand should get DPOY for being versatile, when impact-wise Embiid is the better defender on his own team and Dwight Howard is a bigger reason than Simmons, that the defense stays great after Embiid's injury.   Simmons is still a great perimeter defender and should absolutely make 1st All Defense, but that is it, centers are just way more important defenders and drum roll, please: **It's not even close! The whole conversation about it is horribly stupid! There is no case whatsoever!**  &amp;#x200B;  Underrated are actually quite a lot of players.   ""Rookie X is so bad on defense, total liability!"" Well, yeah, that's about 80% of all rookies and way too often the narrative sticks for too long, when the players have already developed a better understanding for defense. Were they still so terrible, they wouldn't be in the rotation in their 4th year in the league or so, especially most role players, incredible bench scorers aside.   I would nominate Devin Booker, who improved over the years and is now at the level of ""Doesn't help bad defenses, doesn't drag down good ones."""
"Well outside of Spellman, all of those had multiple years in college.  Villanova itself doesnt tend to attract the ELITE prospects in the way that Duke and Kentucky do.  Villanova plays proper team basketball meaning you dont tend to see guys putting up insane stats in the way that say Trae Young did at Oklahoma - Kentucky are similar which is why Devin Booker was picked at 13"

Free my man Trevor Booker  EDIT: Just realised he left the team in 2017. Also he has a brother called Devin
I know I’m joking you would’ve been fine this season and a playoff team without overrated Chris Paul. Devin booker is better with him off the floor.
Devin Booker is overrated af anyway.
"Win Shares isn't always a great metric to go by. For example:  Garrison Matthews has a higher Win Share rate than Russ, would you say if he was starting the Wizards would have more wins?  Robert Williams has a higher Win Share rate than Tatum or Brown  Deandre Ayton has a higher Win Share rate than Devin Booker  Montezl Harrell has higher Win Share rate than Lebron James  Ivica Zubac has a higher Win Share rate than Paul George."
"&gt;Bucks with Giannis  Giannis was predicted as worthy of the risk/reward as a draft pick around the 15 range and sure enough Bucks were picking in that range. If they had the 5th pick in that draft and ""reached"" to pick him I would give them a ton of credit for that but he kinda just fell into their lap. Same thing with Devin Booker on the Suns. He was seen as a pick in the 15 range and he was picked right around there. If Suns had the 8th pick in the draft for example I suspect they would have picked Stanley Johnson or Justise Winslow like anyone else. How much of these great picks (and btw I am not saying Devin Booker was as great of a pick as Giannis, not even close) are just the prospect falling into their lap and how much of it is having better scouting than your rivals?"
"He's Robert Sarver 2.0.  He's going to be cheap, take advantage of fan loyalty, and won't pay to build a winner until he lucks into a Devin Booker level talent by accident."
Devin booker dropping 70.   Edit - he took 40 shots and 26 free throws. Really not that Impressive.  Edit #2 - in a game they lost by 10 points.
"Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are better than Zion Williamson. Zion is looking good though, at least he did last night for long stretches."
"Well first like I said the Pistons were #1 in the East the year before in the regular season. The Suns haven’t made the playoffs forever. And yes I know they have CP3 now, but it still doesn’t change the fact they haven’t played the playoff in forever, so that’s one reason people don’t pay attention to them as much.   Second, I don’t think you want to look at it that way with stars. The Pistons had a historic defense. Ben Wallace was a far more impactful player than Devin Booker. Booker may be the more popular player/elite scorer but Ben Wallace was far more impactful and decorated than Booker. Chauncey Billups also wasn’t a fancy player, but he’ll be a HOFer one day. The only time the Nuggets with made the WCF was with Billups, who was just a winner. And Rip and Sheed made All-Star teams in their career, and Tayshaun was a better version of Mikal Bridges with multiple All Defensive teams, even if it’s somehow written in history that this was a “no-name team.”  But like I said their defense was historic and they had a good track record from previous years, so that’s why they weren’t as big of a underdog as a lot of people today make it out to be.   Plus they had Darko."
You did not seriously just call Devin Booker a HOFer
"&gt;Klay Thompson, Devin Booker and Steph with their baby faces.  Klay doesn't have a baby face. His face is thousands of years old, so old that scientists are still studying how and why it was created - and how it got to Bikini Bottom so Squidward could live in it."
"I mean, if your team has 4-5 all stars then idk even like Devin Booker can be the #1 option lol. or zion or tatum"
"So true. And the players getting the ""hot"" label are always white or lightskin. I mean sure if that's your type go off, but looked at some of these ""hottest nba players"" list bc I needed a comparison for Green and only 5 of 20 were dark skinned.   Instead they included guys like Gordon ""forgettable face"" Hayward, Danilo ""ass chin"" Gallinari or Klay Thompson, Devin Booker and Steph with their baby faces. Sure not ugly, but not really up there."
"It seems like fan bases hate us, when we never care about those fans bases.  Like I don’t hate sun fans, I don’t hate Raptors fans but a lot of fans hate us. I get it tho, we’re arguably the most successful franchise in NBA history and our teams play in the same conference  And I’d probably hate the Suns too if they stopped my team from winning more championships, but they didn’t. Huge fan of Devin Booker and Chris Paul both awesome players"

"I feel like the Younger Millenials or Gen-Z guys would do it. The current generation of players already pretty much dropped the whole ""I will hate you if you're not on my team"" stuff.   Boomers get all mad at that, complain about the league being too ""buddy buddy"". Even though even back in the day it was all mostly for show.   Magic and Larry were friends, as was Barkley and MJ.   So the next gen going a step further and kinda breaking the entire concept of ""franchises"" by just aligning their 3rd UFA in their 30's and doing whatever to form a super super team also kind of ironically seems fitting.  The other thing is... the kids coming in are going to getting PAID PAID.   Devin Booker for example:   * Rookie money = $9M * Rookie Max = $158 * Vet Max= $200M (and this will end when he's 30/31.   He could potentially sign another $200-250M deal and still be valuable at 34/35  Anthony Edwards is starting off with his first four years getting $42M. The rookies that get drafted with the new TV deals could be making A LOT more."
"I think what they’re saying is someone who is on either side of the border, sometimes they’re in, sometimes they’re out. The last guys in and the people just behind them who didn’t make it. Devin Booker would be considered one (right now) since he is always on the cusp of it and has only gotten in as a replacement. Kevin Love is a good example too since he wasn’t consistently selected year after year."
"The quality of players is necessarily relative. If suddenly every other pick was as good as LeBron, then guys like Devin Booker would be seen as busts and wouldn't last. The quality of the game would improve but there would still be good teams, bad teams, and middling teams."
Devin Booker I love you

How the fuck is Devin Booker under 23?
"This year no College team is nearly dominant enough. I do think the 2009-2010 Kentucky team has a chance to hang with a bad NBA team.   PG: John Wall SG: Eric Bledsoe  SF: Darius Miller  PF: Patrick Patterson  C: Demarcus Cousins  Depth is an issue but that starting lineup is solid.   The 2014-2015 Kentucky team is also a possibility. You had Andrew and Aaron Harrison, Trey Lyles, Karl Anthony Towns, and Willie Caulie Stein starting with Devin Booker, Tyler Ullis, and Dakari Johnson off the bench.   Not saying they would win, but saying they’re maybe in the “on a random night” proximity."
Tatum don’t got that much ion think he can’t dominate the paint even for his size and shooting is what makes him elite but he’s not good enough to be in Zion or Luka talks. He like ben simmons or devin booker levels of value

"Tyson's ability to gel with teams never gets enough love. He was a key player on teams led by CP/ David West, Dirk/J-Kidd/Marion/Carlisle, Melo, and then was the buddah of some bad Suns years and helped Devin Booker. So many varied personalities and he always found a way to make it work.   He's one of the most underrated team guys in league history."
As a Nets fan I welcome anyone who wants to play for the team but I was hoping we could have landed Devin Booker and Jimmy Butler and Anthony Davis and Embiid and so on....
"I mean pierce is clutch and all, but he's in the devin booker tier. Probably a step higher.  Dame, MJ, reggie are lightyears ahead."
"A lot of Suns fans don't like him, but he was the best player on the team for a few years, and only asked out after several years of the team being terrible combined with the team benching him tons of games to tank, along with Tyson Chandler. And only made the infamous tweet after they didn't trade him like he asked. I don't blame him at all, he was getting older and the team was clearly stuck rebuilding around a vastly younger Devin Booker, of course he would want to be sent to a contender vs being the now second best player on a tanking, rebuilding team at his age."
Your initial comment with the “Lol” was not very telling on what your stance was about the East. Golden State Warriors never had Klay to begin with this season and Devin Booker missed only the All Star game recently he hasn’t been out. Yes the Trailblazers and Timberwolves has been injured.
"Devin Booker, Steph (though the narrative gets overplayed sometimes), Embiid, and on the obscure side of things... Reggie Jackson.  Oh, and now we can add Zion to that list"
"Patience. We watched Devin Booker go through it too. That’s a mighty talented Pels roster, it’s only a matter of time."
"Chris Paul, I understand Devin Booker and DeAndre ayton are playing well but without Chris Paul the Phoenix Suns would just be about their usual bottom 5 in the west self oh, and I know everybody likes to go on about how they went undefeated in the bubble oh, yes they went undefeated in the bubble and still didn't make the playoffs because they weren't good enough throughout the regular season"
"There are roughly 10 teams that could win this year, so your first options are Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Lebron, Kawhi, and Jokic.  Mitchell is easily the worst of the bunch."
Some players are better floor raisers and others are ceiling raisers. I’d also say that there are about 10-15 guys that can carry a team of bums to the playoffs. Just because a player can’t do doesn’t mean that they aren’t a good player. Is Devin Booker not a good player?
"i've already cried about this on this sub since it happened, but a couple weeks ago i legit got downvoted to like -10 for just straight up saying mikal bridges having a better RPM than devin booker doesn't mean he's a better player. really, the majority of people read that comment and thought mikal bridges is a better player than devin booker because of impact stats lmao. the way people use all-in-one advanced stats without context here is so, so bad."
Devin booker
"&gt;I don't think this is dramatically impacting the game right now. I think this is just an example of outrage culture (a bad tech gets memed to death)  Totally agree. people purposefully take them out of context to shit on the refs. Sports Illustrated wrote an article called ""Suns' Devin Booker Ejected vs. Lakers After Bounce Pass to Ref"". The other angles showed he clearly said something and Bron and KCP had a strong reaction to it, but yeah let's pretend he got ejected because of the bounce pass. Reddit and twitter eat this shit up.  Of course there are some legitimately bad tech calls, but like you said it's not dramatically impacting the game. The first tech isn't a big deal whether it's warranted or not cause it's one Free throw attempt in a game where both teams will score 110+ (and they're disportionately called early in the games). As for the second tech and ejections, Idk if this is more or less than normal, [but Spotrac says there's been 20 ejections this season](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/fines-suspensions/fines/ejection/). That's over roughly 600 games (40 g x 30 teams / 2) and some of them were clearly warranted (Jamal Murray punched a guy in the nuts).   We should seek to improve this, but fixing egregious foul baiting and rip throughs is a way bigger deal."
"Please stop it with this ""Devin Booker didn't deserve a T"" lie that can easily be dispelled by watching that game. Hell, you can just watch the 3rd quarter and see that Devin Booker deserved a T for *constantly* bitching at the refs that quarter.  While his initial technical foul incident was not major, in and of itself, it came at the tail end of a solid 6 minutes of game play with Booker complaining after almost every possession, so his initial T was absolutely warranted.  I'm also a big fan of a Euroleague fan telling us that flopping is a big issue in the modern NBA."
Devin Booker
"Serge Ibaka, JJ Redick, George Hill, and Al Horford over KPJ and Devin Booker?"
Devin Armani Booker  Ricky Rubio
no. Devin booker should be in the MVP conversation if you are talking about a suns player in the conversation
"I think r/nba loses it's credibility to criticize any officiating for the next little while. Between this and the Devin Booker ejection, it's quite clear people don't understand the rules they think NBA refs mess up every night.  Kyrie touched the ball. Randle had possession the entire time. That's not a jump ball. That's not a block. Randle 100% travelled and it's not even debatable."
"honestly man, if it's any Sun, it's Devin Booker. lol He's awesome, but he's not on, like, Bradley Beal's level, much less a full blown superstar. I think he's good enough to be a leading scorer ona. championship team, I just think there's a good reason the team got better this year and it's a combination of Mikal Bridges, Chris Paul, and the addition of Jae Crowder. Chris Paul is a basketball genius, I don't care if he's only averaging 16 a game; hes influencing the game more than a lot of 25 ppg guys."

"The Celtics 2 best players are top 3 picks, the Pelicans have 2 all-star caliber players who were both top 3 picks, 1 on their own accord and 1 through trading AD (yeah it’s called rebuilding, do your Googles), Donovan Mitchell was a lottery pick, Devin Booker was a lottery pick, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were lottery picks, Bam Adebayo was a lottery pick."
Huh? The Suns bench has been great even if you ignore the obvious Devin Booker
lol nobody was picking Devin Booker 3rd in 2015...
"Joe Harris- Love shooters  Devin Booker- Again, love shooters  Jokic- I like flashy passes and trippy jumpshots that go in"

"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."
I wonder how he feels about Devin Booker being 6'5
"This conversation is wild. The Raptors aren't going anywhere this year or in the foreseeable future. Thats facts. When healthy with a tight rotation they could probably steal a 4/5 series but that's about it.   The Sixers are not going to have success in the playoffs with Ben Simmons as their primary ball handler/second option. This is also facts. We've seen this with Giannis as well and Ben Simmons is very much a poor mans Giannis.  I think this Philly team as constructed will be a tough out in the 2nd round. Miami, Milwaukee, or Boston can definitely beat them. Indiana, or a even a healthy Toronto might be able to upset them as well but I think that's unlikely.   If you think Ben Simmons is better than Kyle Lowry, particularly in the playoffs, I don't really know what to say to you. Philly should be all in on Lowry, especially if they can somehow keep Thybulle and Danny Green.   Ben Simmons is a quality starter but he's definitely overrated. Overrated doesn't mean bad. Devin Booker is overrated and that dude is a flamethrower. Khris Middleton is overrated and he's a 50/40/90 guy. Overrated does not mean bad."

Devin Booker because he is fun to watch and is the best player on my favorite team. He is efficient and don't need to jack up 10 3s a game or foul bait
"ESPN:  Sixers win once again proves that Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons can't play together, is it time Joel Embiid demands a trade and forces his way to the juggernaut Knicks to join with Devin Booker for the playoff push?"
"If Utah ends up with best record by far, it seems many people will not want to only give them one player in the 3rd team. League leader in points per game has always been, as I remember, always at the lowest 2nd team All-NBA, but I think Beal's situation my be an exception. So I think Kyrie, Mitchell, Devin Booker, Chris Paul and Beal all are close. I guess I could bet on Beal because he probably has the least of ""shared vote"" with others.  Paul George has a great season, I think he'd be there. Also they can count Anthony Davis as forward I think, last season it was totally possible so why not now, he could get votes over any non-star players. With the missed time he might miss it anyway though, because Jimmy Butler is playing fantastic.   These are the doubts I'd say, the other guys in this list are basically sure bets to be All-NBA."

Just replace Devin Booker with your teams favorite young superstar and it'll ring true eventually.
"I’m not pointing fingers or placing the blame on anyone, but Devin Booker, you might want to consider moving on from Kendall Jenner  You’re handsome, young, most likely swinging big dick. You’ll recover, but my alcohol addiction will not! MOVE ON AND FOCUS ON GETTING US THIS RING YOU SELFISH SEXY HUNK!"
Devin Booker plays an instrument but Chris Paul plays the orchestra. Suns are an 8th seed without him &amp; get bounced in the first round. Raises their ceiling &amp; floor.
Suns fans had to deal with 5 years of people calling Devin Booker a losing empty stats player. Then when they finally start winning casuals give 100% credit to Chris Paul even though they were already on a upswing. I feel Suns fans 100%
Devin Booker is such a freaking sick player.  I’m pumped for the suns this year they’ve really got such a fun team to watch and root for (as long as the lakers aren’t playing).
"Cause yall said he was the next Devin Booker and your fans on your subreddit were saying ""I would rather develop the kids then trade for James Harden"" for Lowry I would still do it but I understand but your fans were reluctant to deal him for JAMES MOTHERFUCKING HARDEN"

It would be a fun team to watch score 120 points a night And probably allow 130 just all gas and no brake's"
"Stats wise he's still superstar level in the playoffs. Last playoffs he averaged 27ppg 14 rpg and 6 apg. That's more than all star level. Honestly, I think the reason he doesn't have much playoff  success is because he's a Shaq. And what did Shaq need? A clutch perimeter superstar guard. Let's be real Giannis and Shaq aren't the type of players to hit dagger 3's in the 4th quarter. Like say the opposing team hits a 3 pointer and then you answer back with a 3 pointer of your own. Giannis/Shaq aren't those type of players. So that's why Giannis/Shaq need a clutch perimeter superstar that can do that in the 4th. Shaq only won rings when he had Kobe and Wade. Clutch perimeter superstars. That's what Giannis needs. Giannis actually plays well in the playoffs. He just doesn't have that clutch perimeter player teaming up with him. I would say Devin Booker or Kyrie would be a perfect fit for him. Luka too."
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8.

Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
Zion averages one more defensive rebound per game than Devin Booker
I think it’s time for Chris Paul to get his ring and devin booker to announce himself as a super star. Homie could drop 80 in a game if he needed to and given the chance
"On the side and outside of work, like Shannon is rooting for the Lakers and Skip, The Cowboys/etc. So probably a little bit.  But usually, those segments are drawn up with 'bad guy'/'good guy' and the 'bad guy' gets th*e ""Devin Booker needs to leave the Suns! Go to the Knicks!""* argument, and then the other pundit will be the pro-Phoenix side and say, ""*Phoenix is a lovely city, I don't know...""* do they actually give a shit about Devin Booker/Suns? Probably not... they just want comments/clicks.  Anti-Bron vs. Pro-Bron.  So Skip has to argue on behalf of the Clippers and his storyline is ""Lebron bad!"" and Shannon gets to argue: ""Lebron good!""  Lebron, Steph, KD get clicks.  They want Knicks/Lakers fans (huge fanbases) to tune in. They also will take advantage of Sixers/Celtics/Warriors because those are interested markets as well."
Just behind Devin Booker
Devin booker would be my pick for the most likely to do it.
Never gonna happen. Unless a team is playing 5 on 3 I don’t see it. They need to deal with what Devin Booker did a few years back before they look at Wilt.
"It's not a knock on him I just think some guys below him are close talent wise and have proven more. Donovan and Devin average more points on winning teams and while they are in much better situations can we continue to look past the fact that KAT hasn't really as accomplished anything yet. More and more stars continue to catch up with those numbers and at this point I'd put a lot of guys ahead of him till I can see how far KAT can lead a solid roster around him. I know it's unfair that he hasn't gotten a good roster around him yet but the gap has gotten small enough between the guys behind him talent wise that I don't think it's a given to put KAT ahead of guys like Booker, Mitchell, Trae, and others as well."

Here is the full list updated on the season:  Julius Randle: 7/22  Kyrie Irving: 4/14  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 5/13  Devin Booker: 3/11  Steph Curry: 1/5  LeBron James: 2/8  Bradley Beal: 1/7  Domantas Sabonis: 2/6  Jayson Tatum: 2/6  Jaylen Brown: 2/6  John Collins: 1/7  DeAaron Fox: 1/6
"How? Devin Booker has been the better player his entire career, and you could even make the argument he is this year.  The biggest difference is 3pt shooting, but Booker is still just as efficient as Brown at 59% TS. Booker is a far better playmaker as I'm concerned. Only one more assist this year, but his playmaking duties have been taken over by CP3.  Brown benefits from not even being the number one offensive option on his team unlike Booker. And defensively he's only slightly better than Book. They're both terrible off the ball and average on ball."
I promise you Jaylen Brown is a better player than Devin Booker.
ya how could OP list devin booker and not this one

Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i´ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren´t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"
"I didn't mention Pat myself - but it is laughable that you're implying he's above criticism on roster decisions, he's made mistakes and so has Pop.  I was referring to blue tick Miami media members who were uncertain if Herro could be part of a Harden deal. You might also remember the Miami organisation felt Herro was on course to be better than Devin Booker"
Devin Booker
"He just passed the age of 26 and is 44 points away from 10k. Other than Giannis, he's the youngest player to have that many points. Devin Booker (8992 at 24.6yo) and KAT (8987 at 25.4yo) are the players younger than him who will likely catch up to him eventually.   He probably needs around a total of 12,500 points to guarantee being in the top 250 scorers of all time. (The current cutoff is Kevin Martin at 12,396, though other players reaching top 250 will knock out others like Oakley, Carol Butler, Joe Barry Carroll, among others.) In short, he needs a little more than 2.5k points, which he should hit in two seasons."
Devin Booker is a good player???? WTF I THOUGHT HE WAS ONLY PUTTING UP EMPTY STATS ON A BAD TEAM
"this doesn't even mention ayton was suspended for 25 games and hurt for another 13 last year. we were essentially playoff team before CP3 got here. All our young guys took jumps either going into the bubble, or going into this season or both. We added in key players like payne (in the bubble) Crowder, Craig. and we found the proper positions for undervalued players in the league like saric as a small ball 5, and Carter as more a backup 2 guard. CP has been legitimately great for us but somehow he has become overrated in his greatness as if we wouldn't still be the 5th-6th seed without him.  Especially in this thread the phoenix suns best player Devin Booker needs to get his credit."
Good company right there. Also devin booker has a 12+ inch dick. So that’s pretty rare company too
Luka took his team to the playoffs before Booker despite being drafted 3 years later. Devin an all around bum. and if you sweep us it’s cause CP3 pulled the carry job of the century.
"Well, Devin Booker is next in ""the other teams in the west that are doing well that have a young star that must die apparently""."
Devin Booker is my favorite athlete ever so no duh I want him to be a Sun forever. We're 40-15 so I'm more than happy with the way this team is
Imagine if Devin Booker or KAT or Zion request/requested trades on a rookie contract.
"Mark Aguirre, Horacio Llamas, Eduardo Najera, Jorge Gutierrez, Gustavo Ayon, Devin Booker, and Juan Toscano-Anderson."
"I was just simplifying the concept if nationality, if he was born or has a mexican nationality then he us mexican, Devin Booker has neither."
The disrespect to Devin Booker is heavy. Not Mexican enough to count sorry
Devin Booker seems to be heavily disliked by Clippers and Jazz fans (maybe Sixers?) but the rest seem to enjoy him
Suns fans remember “Dennis Smith Jr is better than Devin Booker” shit tier takes
"I think a few things happened.   First, the Suns actually had Ayton on the floor for a stretch of competitive games. The suspension and injuries last year pre-bubble killed the team.  Second, Oubre being out meant Mikal Bridges could start. His smart, unselfish play on both sides of the floor is invaluable to the Suns. Oubre is fun to watch, but he’s a black hole for ball movement and he’s not quite as good on D as Bridges.  The bench showed a ton of improvement, headlined by the late signing of Cam Payne giving the Suns a real backup PG.  Ricky Rubio showed the league just how much real point guard could help Devin Booker and the young Suns core.  And Booker showed the world what Playoff Book really looks like."
And imagine if devin booker actually helped you win games instead of putting up empty stats. /s
"Ehh that's how the majority of 22 year olds react when dropping 24ppg. Devin Booker in his age 22 season, where he dropped 24 ppg on damn near identical splits to Sexton, talked mad shit and said they where making the playoffs or something. It just seems to be a natural progression."
"1 and 2 are huge mistakes. 3 is over-blown. He had a better deal but it fell through, not his fault IIRC. 4, Drafted Chriss and traded for Papagiannis and Bogdanovic. Out of the next 5 picks after Chriss only Sabonis is better than Bogdanovic. Donovan and Bam were the last 2 picks in the lottery, it wasn't the obvious choice like Luka. The Kings were more likely to drafty Malik Monk or Luke Kennard. Yes, Vlade is a bad GM because he did not predict Devin Booker would turn into an all-star. Do you think the 14 teams that passed on Giannis were idiots also?"
Has someone made a compilation of those two annoying ass podcasters who spent years trying to disparage Devin Booker because he couldnt carry a shit steam single handedly before turning 21?
"I was skeptical of them making the playoffs this season, let alone being a top-three seed in the Western Conference. Boy, was I wrong!   In my opinion, Monty Williams should be the overwhelming favorite for Coach of the Year. Chris Paul will finish top-five in MVP voting. The only reason why CP3 isn’t a more serious MVP candidate is his lack of traditional/counting stats.  However, as a user commented below, the Chris Paul effect is real, and the Suns as a whole have improved. It’ll be nice seeing Devin Booker on a much bigger stage in the playoffs."
I watched Devin Booker get mugged after Fox shot free throws. No call. The Suns get literally no love from the refs so someone saying that they are in our favor pisses me off because it's already bad enough that the refs don't respect us despite being one of the best teams in the NBA. We are 29th in free throws this year
"&gt;	RAPTOR ranks Alex Caruso as the 47th best player in the NBA over Kristaps Porzingis, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vuecevic, Bam Adebeyo, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Domantas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward.   this really does speak volumes, perhaps not about what you think"
"&gt; Wasn’t Kobe aided in his scoring average because of the volume of shots he took?  Yes. Kobe was not a perfect player, and his inefficiency relative to other historically great scorers hurt us at times. That said, he was not that bad relative to the league average, which is the way I think players should be evaluated (to control for changing trends that are outside of the players control, like the 3 point revolution).  &gt; He shot 45% for his career, to Russ’ 44%.  Again, FG% is a bad measure. It doesn't account for free throws or the fact that 3 pointers are worth more. I like rTS, which is simply a player's TS% relative to league average.  &gt; Would anyone say Kobe wasn’t one of the greatest scorers of his generation?  Of course he was one of the greatest scorers of his generation. He was also notably more efficient than Russ. During his scoring peak, he was scoring on ~3 to 4 percent above league average (which is about the difference between CP3 and Schroder, or Devin Booker and Marvin Bagley). Russ, in his 2 scoring title seasons, scored almost exactly at league average efficiency (0.2 percent difference)."
Devin Booker is younger than Mikal Bridges
"If you go look at Shai's stats, guy is putting up some indications that he'll continue to be very good. His recent PnR stats were bonkers, IIRC. He is a young guy who has seemed to learn a lot from Chris Paul, and has a lot of good point guard skillset.  And this goes further into... how do you know who will be a top 15 guy or not? If Jokic doesn't have Murray/MPJ who is he? What are his stats like? He's still a fantastic player but his assists aren't up anymore without good guys around him.  Devin Booker was looked down on until he got a better roster/more help."
"Bron, Dame, Devin Booker vs the Mavs"
Devin Booker
If anyone has a bad season they're going to NYC or LA  If anyone has a good season (Devin Booker/Dame) they're going to NYC or LA  according to ESPN/Sports Illustrated/etc. lol
I don’t wanna hear that while y’all have Devin “I’ll talk shit while getting help from the refs and banged on by PG” Booker
This guy is my new favourite suns fan. Sorry whoever made the Devin Booker sunny clip.
Except for CP3 and Devin Booker (;
Remember StatMuse seriously asking if Colin Sexton is better than Devin Booker?
Best league ever  1 - Anthony Davis + LeBron James  2 - Giannis Antetokounmpo + Luka Doncic  3 - Joel Embiid + James Harden  4 - Nikola Jokic + Kawhi Leonard  5 - Kevin Durant + Steph Curry  6 - Rudy Gobert + Jimmy Butler + Damian Lilard  7 - Bam Adebayo + Paul George + Kyrie Irving  8 - Karl Anthony Towns + Jayson Tatum + Ben Simmons  9 - Draymond Green + Devin Booker + Chris Paul  10 - Kristaps Porzingis + Zion Williamson + Donovan Mitchell  11 - Clint Capela + Jaylen Brown + Bradley Beal
Yes. I still think that. Devin Booker is fools gold.
Their team rosters were shitty. Do you think Devin Booker before this year was just a big fish in a small pond?
"Advanced metrics Paul destroys booker, Paul leads by a significant margin in VORP, OBPM, DBPM, OWS, DWS, WS/48   We get that Devin booker has been a suns player his whole career and he’s your fans favorite player, but CP3 is your teams mvp."
"Devin Booker went 4-16 for 12 pts and the Suns obliterated the Heat by 20.  Fuckin wild. Not like the Heat are missing tons of important players either. Butler, Bam, Nunn, Dragic, Herro, Duncan all out there.  I'd say ""imagine saying that to Suns fans during the finals last year!"", but they'd probably be clamoring about the bubble Suns winning the whole thing ..."
Props to Devin Booker tonight for taking time out of his busy schedule as the top player on the 2nd best team in the NBA to build brick houses for under served populations in the greater Phoenix area. I’m proud of his commitment to our community
"It just said ""Devin Booker"""
Get like devin booker to come play with AD
"Ehh, Deandre Ayton #1 tier talent, Devin Booker and CP3?   vs. Julius Randle?   It's close, but if the Knicks get end like 8-1 or something I'm voting Thibs."
no great defensive player had ever before been beaten on a single play by a good offensive player! Bless Devin Booker for revealing the truth to us!
"I watched about 30 suns games this season on TV since they are my local team. And Devin Booker is obviously the better and most valuable player. CP3 is one of the worst defenders in the league, he plays super safe, the suns would’ve been just fine with Ricky Rubio running point. In fact, the offense is better with Booker and without CP3. I will credit CP3s leadership. I think he does help their team out, but he is not the most valuable player."
Ok but that doesn’t make him a horrible pick like you said in your original comment. Also I personally don’t believe JJJ is better than Ayton but it is arguable I guess. Does this also mean all the players taken above devin booker were terrible picks too.
"Oubre is on the bench and very inconsistent. He dropped 40 for one game. Draymond is not a walking triple double, Westrbrook is. Draymond is a great defender and goes well with Curry. Wiggins is inconsistent as hell, but still a good starter. Curry actually won the Warriors most of their games. You tripping if you think Curry has the same help as CP3. He has Devin Booker. If Curry had Klay then this would be different.   CP3 still had bad games man, he's a human being. Also, Curry beat the hell out of CP3 in every single playoff series they've played against each other."
"Lmao are you 8 years old? They're 2-1 against the Suns. One loss we didn't have Devin Booker. Another loss the NBA reported that Murray travelled on a shot to send the game to OT. Now without Murray, y'all wouldn't beat us"
Devin Booker
What would Devin Booker say to that?

We'll take a small payment of one Devin Booker and you've got a deal
"Suns -  Suns first championship  CP3 wins one at 35  Suns win chip after missing POs for a decade  James Jones turning around the franchise in just 2 years.  Devin 'injury replacement allstars' Booker rise from empty stats player  Cam Payne from out of league to 6 man on a championship squad  Monty Williams choosing Suns over Lakers, and for good reasons  Jae Crowder in the Finals once again, this time on the winning team  Draymond Green saying Devin Booker should get his ass out of Phoenix"
Why do people think Devin Booker looks like the guitarist from Limp Bizkit?
"Assuming the seeds are as current, here are my predictions:  &amp;#x200B;  First Round (West):  Suns (1) vs Grizzlies (8) : Phoenix in 5.  Clippers (4) vs Lakers (5) : Clippers in 6  Nuggets (3) vs Blazers (6) : Nuggets in 6  Jazz (2) vs Mavs (7) : Jazz in 6  &amp;#x200B;  Second round:  Suns (1) vs Clippers (4) : Phoenix in 6  Jazz (2) vs Nuggets (3) : Nuggets in 7  &amp;#x200B;  WCF:   Suns (2) vs Nuggets (3) : Phoenix in 6  &amp;#x200B;  First Round (East):  76ers (1) vs Hornets (8) : 76ers in 4  Knicks (4) vs Hawks (5) : Knicks in 5  Bucks (3) vs Heat (6) : Bucks in 6  Nets (2) vs Celtics (7) : Nets in 5  &amp;#x200B;  Second Round:  76ers (1) vs Knicks (4) : 76ers in 6  Bucks (3) vs Nets (2) : Bucks in 7  &amp;#x200B;  ECF: 76ers (1) vs Bucks (3) : Bucks in 6  &amp;#x200B;  Finals: Suns (1) vs Bucks (3) : Suns in 6.  &amp;#x200B;  I really... REALLY believe in this Phoenix team. Devin Booker is the 2nd best SG in the NBA, Ayton is having a breakout year, CP3 is doing his thing, and they have plenty of great pieces around them.  I also really don't believe in Brooklyn. Yes they have KD and Kyrie and Harden, but there's no telling when these guys are all going to be healthy. They out-talent the rest of the NBA by a long shot but I don't know if they will have the health. Plus the Bucks have a really good matchup for that series."
"That's true, guess thinking if the entire roster healthy. The roster has some talent, I love Shai - my Devin Booker All-Star this year (stats deserving, record held him back,) Horford is a winning player, DORT, and really intrigued by guys like Maledon and Bazley + and my guy Tiger Rome."
I agree with him. Suns are a fake seed. Championship teams aren't scared of playoff virgin Devin Booker or second round fodder Chris Paul.
Devin booker are way better and bring more offensively with their shooting when they don't have the ball the three of them are average defender and mitchell and booker are barely worse playmakers. They are worse rebounders but I don't believe that is that much of an x of wing players. Westbrook has also had awful shooting splits the whole season other than the last month while booker and mitchell have been consistent most of the season. Record wise it isn't like the 4th to 6th seed it's the 10th in the east vs the second or third in the west
"Yeah I'm not that enamored with book. 25 ppg on efficiency +/- 2% of average is pretty easily to replace for me. Average on defense, below average shooter, a little above average with the ball but obviously nothing special that elevates his teammates.   MPJ right now is doing more for his team with his scoring and gravity from deep. 20 ppg on 66 TS is fucking nuts. That's closer to 2014 KD than 2021 Devin Booker."
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"Every impact metric on the planet says that CP3 is the best player on the Suns. He isn’t even close to being a real MVP candidate, but he is the best player on that team. Devin Booker is just their best scorer. CP3’s complete game has a more profound effect on winning basketball games overall."
"Devin Booker w/ CP3 off the floor: (Per 75 possessions)  30.7 PTS  6.1 AST 5.0 REB  51.9% FG 40.2% 3PT 61.7% TS (+4.6 rTS)  PHX’s ORTG: 120.9 (+8.7 relORTG)  Phoenix has the 2nd best offense in NBA History when Booker is on the floor w/o Chris Paul  Like I said before, Booker is carrying CP3 and the Suns."
You mean how it measure how often a play ends with that player? It’s a good measurement of how much a team relies on a player to create offense for the team and how much that player has the ball in their hands. Devin booker ends more offensive plays for his team than Tatum does.
"&gt; They were a borderline playoff team last year when there second best player missed 15 games...  And the teams that finished in front of them (Portland and Memphis) had their 2-3rd best players injured for much longer than that. In Portland's case, Nurkic missed all but 8 games.  So yeah, they were a borderline playoff team last year, and would've remained a borderline playoff team this year.  Im not even arguing CP3 is the MVP or anything like that, but it's pretty damn obvious he's their best player.  He leads Booker in every single meaningful metric and it's not even close.  Booker Win Shares: 4.4, WS/48: 0.107, BPM: 0.3, VORP: 1.1, ORTG: 110, DRTG: 112, TS: 58.7%, PER: 19.3  CP3 Win Shares: **8.1**, WS/48: **0.198**, BPM: **4.5**, VORP: **3.2**, ORTG: **123**, DRTG: **109**, TS: **59.4%**, PER: **20.9**  Again, Devin Booker has no argument aside from PPG, which is a ridiculous measurement tool"

Devin Booker
Royce o'Neale aka Royce Booker because Devin is now his father
Devin Booker must lead the league in toe on the line threes. Got Bojan with step back a few possessions earlier for the long two.
Arrest Devin Booker.  What he just did is a crime.
Puts it into context why Kobe would praise Devin Booker dropping 70.
Jayson tatum micheal Jordan and Devin booker. Name a more iconic trio
"Devin Booker takes a ton of tough, heavily contested jumpers. He's kinda Kobe-esque in that regard."
Can’t go wrong with either one but this is ridiculous logic.   You’d take Derek Fisher over Devin Booker with this mindset.
"Wilt's 100 points is always in reach.  Play 0 D, give it to a scorer.   That's how Devin Booker got 70."
They're offense wouldn't be nearly as good without cp3 unless you're banking on cam Payne and Devin Booker to run the offense
"record-wise of course, but he has another all star player in Devin Booker.  He should be all nba third team tho.  Also statistically speaking, luka is playing better with no other current all star on his team."
You put Devin Booker again instead of Mitchell? lol
"Don't worry. You won't wake up in August 2020, in the offseason. Freshly signed Suns General Manager Vlade Divac hasn't blown up the team after Devin Booker tore his achilles in the last game of the bubble (which didn't end up mattering anyway). He certainly didn't trade Ayton for the drafting rights to Liangelo Ball and a copying machine. And Biontech/Pfizer didn't just cancel their vaccine for the lack of results.  None of that happened. Or did it?"
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
"Stats don't tell the whole story first of all. The Westbrook-CP3 trade highlights how much more valuable an impact CP3 has. CP3 took a bunch of newbies last year and their record was close to the Rockets, and they came quite close to beating the Rockets (who had 2 top 10 players in their prime).  Also the Rockets with CP3 were the only team to truly challenge a mostly healthy Warriors with KD.   Devin Booker may be the best player on the team, but his IQ is nowhere near CP3, and that impact makes him MVP worthy."
"Honestly, I think CP3 will sneak in quite a few first place votes due to Sun's being 2nd seed (assuming they finish there) and his recent play has been spotlighted more and more. Not saying I agree with it, but being a top 2 seed he fits the MVP  'rules' of being the best player on a top 2 team (which is also arguable because Devin Booker).  Embiid certainly will take several votes."
&gt;There was then a second round of backlash because of dumbass Chris Broussard saying he left Avery Bradley off his all defense team because Devin Booker dropped 70 on the Celtics.  But why get mad at Booker for something Broussard said?
"It was mostly praise by national media and headlines.  It was a lot of backlash from the vocal minority of nerds and salty Celtics fans (like me) on here.  There was then a second round of backlash because of dumbass Chris Broussard saying he left Avery Bradley off his all defense team because Devin Booker dropped 70 on the Celtics.  Bradley did not play that game, which in theory should have bolstered his case.  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Broussard situation is why I wouldn't want stat-fixing to happen.  If you don't watch the game and aren't aware of the stat-fixing, you'll have to deal with too many nephews with too many bad takes."
"&gt; He's the same player, still the number one option scoring 25+ per game on solid efficiency  Devin Booker was 24th in TS% last season. This season, he's not even top 80. His assists have also dropped by more than 2, but he's still turning the ball over almost as much as last year.  &gt; Yes, his TS% is slightly down but that has almost everything to do with him shooting a worst FT% on 2 less attempts  Yes, because taking the ball out of his hands has lowered his opportunities to draw fouls, but he hasn't really made up for that in any way with his scoring from the field"
Get the fuck out of here. He is not a better playmaker or passer.  Book would ball handle circles around Bam. Just because this year he shares the floor with the point god does not mean that Bam is a better passer. Bam actually is a better rebounder (he's a big). Give you that. One of the best FG% for a high volume scorer in the league. However big's always have higher FG% so that point is irrelevant (Top 20 FG% in the NBA are all bigs.) Your favorite players favorite player is Devin Booker. That's just the way it is. Mans elite.        edit: clarity.
Yeah he and devin booker I feel are very similar players overall except booker this year finally got a great PG to back him and now he can focus on what he is great at
huh? Devin Booker did it just a few years ago. wasn't record-breaking but the team was clearly helping him score.
He is the classic case of someone being asked to do too much. Ideally he's the second star on a team or is in the Devin Booker role next to an elite point guard to set him up off ball.  He's just got too much of an on ball usage which can drain him.  He has improved a lot though.
Devin Booker is a good leap and bound above Adebayo in draft steal per draft position.
Devin Booker hung 70 on Marcus Smart but that game is apparently a stain on his resume lol
Youngest to have a 50 point double double w assists and 4th youngest to reach a 50 point game.  Brandon Jennings - 20 years old and 52 days  Lebron James - 20 years old and 80 days and again at 20 years old and 345 days  Devin Booker - 20 years old and 145 days  Kevin Porter Jr. - 20 years old and 360 days
"""Get my boy Steph outta Golden State""  - Devin Booker"
Devin Booker riding into the playoffs on a chariot of fire named Chris Paul
The casual fan never gets to see Devin Booker. These playoffs will effectively be his introduction to the World.
I'd consider myself a casual fan. Had genuinely no idea that Devin Booker had ever dropped 70.
Cp3 getting some recognition in the league as the MVP and he still makes it about devin booker. Humble guy. 🙌
the analytics crowd loves devin booker. i have no idea what you are talking about.
Devin Booker is a role player. All he does is score.
Should Devin Booker take a Lou Williams role off the bench?
"I dont watch the suns but can someone explain why cp3 or devin booker arent mvp candidates this year? Esp cp3 like they went from last season barely missing the playoffs to the second seed in the west once he joined, that may have happened w out him but still the man has been clutch all year. Is it just a case of 'he has a costar so he cant be mvp' bs?"
"I'll never forget SI posting a video titled ""Is Devin Booker Actually Good?""  And that was like, maybe two years ago. Not when he was a rookie or something."
"My best friend is a Suns fan and I hate him (but sorta like the Suns). I couldn’t in good conscience pretend like I didn’t think they’d make the playoffs so INSTEAD I trolled him by saying Chris Paul  is a better player than Devin Booker. That got him annoyed for some time, but not anymore lol."
"Devin Booker is very good, but when you watch the way Chris Paul controls crucial games it’s hard not to say Paul is their most important player."
Devin Booker laughs
Well deserved. We get to see Devin Booker and CP3 in the Playoffs!
They really gave Devin Booker Chris Paul and people put the Suns as a low playoff seed
I've been on this misery train ride the last decade.  Fuck you bledsoe fuck you ariza fuck you morris fuck whatever fucker we drafted not named devin booker from like 2010-2017 or whatever fuck the spurs and Lakers but most importantly FUCK YOU ROBERT HORRY.  Kings you're cool though
Devin Booker is a big name. I just took the question as things we havent seen before in the playoffs.
They really tried to tell us that Devin Booker was an empty stats player even though we were the ones watching his horrible teammates let him down for years.
"lmao literally, like Devin Booker is barely 25. everyone has to chill with these expectations put on good young players"
Your gonna act like they don’t shoot jumpshots a lot? Your best players are Chris Paul and Devin Booker. They also had more fta tonight anyway while you still shot 37 3’s
Chris Paul and Devin Booker are legit threats. Of course they can.
"I'm not offended that someone doesn't think Steph was the catalyst for a lot of this change.  I disagree, and it has to do with how offenses and defenses treat the 3 more than pure volume.  But I'm watching the kids emulating Steph and let me tell you....they're not Steph haha.  Frankly, at the lower levels it's bad for basketball.  When I was coming up in high school and AAU people were already backing up to near half court hitting those shots, but only if they were true elites (future NBA players, mostly).  What I'm seeing out of the true elites in high school right now is that they can hit 3's (they shoot them at the 3 point line) but that they are insane multi talents.  Bigger guys who are definitely scorers but can really handle the ball and pass.  Honestly I'm seeing guys more in the Devin Booker and (smaller) Zion mold than the Steph Curry mold out in AAU and high school ball.  Not that that's a bad thing, and not that you don't see the occasional misguided and talented guy pulling up just inside of half court, but those dudes are mostly not taken seriously.  Basically, if other people could do what Steph does, they would."
I guarantee you it'll be easier to game plan for MPJ than Jamal Murray/Donovan Mitchell/Devin Booker.
"Devin Booker and Michael Porter Jr.      IDK if either are like shocking, but if they hit their ceilings they're going to be good enough to win one."
Not exactly the *most* unexpected but I could see Devin booker taking another step and becoming that guy. He’s already been an all-star each of the last two years and has looked great this season next to Chris Paul
Devin Booker.
"""Her favorite players include Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Kobe, Devin Booker, ..and Jevon Carter""  Wuh whaat?"
"So you don’t think teams have different defensive game plans from a generic 29 ppg scorer on 60% TS and a generic 35 ppg scorer on 58% TS? Because of course they do, I mean they even started gameplanning Harden different when his scoring first increased to that next level in 2017 and didn’t stop until 2019.   Role players hitting an additional 58% TS from corner 3s. This isn’t them not hitting shots then all of a sudden hitting 8 shots. This is those role players getting an additional 8 shots on top of what they are already getting.   But Harden doesn’t just have an advantage from playmaking, he also clearly has an advantage from scoring. The difference in 2018 scoring (36 ppg on 61.6% TS vs 28 ppg on 64.4% TS) is equivalent to the difference between Devin Booker (25.5 ppg on 58.5% TS) and Norman Powell (18.6 ppg on 62% TS) this season. I would love to see you make this exact same argument, that Norman Powell is on the same level scoring as Devin Booker, as you are making for Harden and Giannis. Little bit tougher to see the legitimacy of the argument when you remove the bias behind Harden’s name."
"Thunder fans: because he forced a trade after a disappointing playoff series.  Everyone else: because Lakers fans don't like him?  The ""because he's cocky"" reason is weird because he's hardly alone in being overconfident (see: Devin Booker, Dame Lillard, etc.).  The ""because he cheated on his girlfriend"" reason is weird because popular NBA players have done worse and never been widely hated (Jason Kidd and Tony Parker come to mind)"
"neither of the brooklyn guards have had a first-team caliber season compared to their peers. steph, luka, dame, chris paul, argubly even devin booker, and donovan mitchell have better cases than them."
"KD wanted OKC to draft Devin Booker and lobbied hard for it. Unfortunately, they couldn't and drafted Cameron Payne."
Devin Booker
I hope Devin Booker goes on and comment Draymond should get out of Golden State
Devin Booker and Kevin Garnett
Kobe and Devin Booker Rest In Peace Kobe miss you mamba
of course his initial is MJ.  Also back when he was starting games next to Devin Booker
"He's been great for awhile now, this was just an off night. Still think he's in the Jayson Tatum or Devin Booker range of value"
And fts of course. Devin Booker barely shoots threes and only averages around 6ftas.   Kobe’s volume is just nuts
Kobe was also going for the win which he did. I’m down to see someone go for 101 but only if it’s in a semi close game. None of that Devin Booker shit.
"That was not the opinion at the time. Jayson Tatum was the prize and the Celtics had Jaylen Brown too. Especially since Julius Randle left in free agency and was not on the team Lebron joined.  But there were many other teams. For example the Suns, who had Devin Booker and Josh Jackson. The Jazz with Donovan Mitchell and Dante Exum. The Sixers with Simmons and Fultz. Heck he could have gone to the Timberwolves and flipped KAT for Ad."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOMCLOpNPPc  Devin Booker hates the big moment right /u/mangoplastic17
"It's not really that confusing  Devin Booker hasn't played a meaningful game in his NBA career, such as a playoff game  Thus I'm interested to see if he crumbles under the pressure or shines  Clearer?"
He’s not very good at them ala Devin booker

Devin Booker went 13 and even looking at Kevin Porter Jr. rn who fell to 30 is kind of crazy
"I remember that ESPN video that posed the question ""Will Devin Booker force a trade to the Knicks? | KJZ"" just as the Suns were in the midst of finally turning things around.  So clearly it's because Book is going to force a trade to be with the Knicks /s"
Lol have you seen how much Devin Booker cries? Trae Young fishes for fouls almost as bad as Harden. I guess Gen Z basketball players don’t cry to the refs? I must be imagining it every game
Devin booker is definitely below average but not anywhere near Bertans/Kanter.
"Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Gary Trent Jr., Ja Morant, Collin Sexton, Doug McDermott, Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, Tim Hardaway Jr."
Devin Booker dies
I mean the Heat said they think he will be better than Devin Booker
Devin Booker about to request a trade to the Heat
And Trae isn’t bitch made like Devin booker. So there’s that too
&gt;The type that someone who averages 7 assists can score more in 1 playoff game than a supposed great scorer can do in 2 whole seasons can't be ignored.   Sooo Devin Booker&gt; Michael Jordan.. got it
It shows the same stat for every 'devin booker vs XYZ' for me.. not working monke
If that’s a shove then Devin Booker should be kicked out of the NBA lmao
Devin Booker
"Has 0 to do with Toni. I hated Lebron on the Cavs for it and he made me root for the KD Warriors over him with this stupid style he adopted. Toni is just a second hand byproduct. I shouldn't ever be rooting for Moss Point, but they managed to make Devin Booker the likable one last night.   It's sad man, 2007 Lebron was one of the greatest individual performances to watch all time. Hell, Black Mask on the Heat Lebron was wild too. How is this the same player now?  So physical yet cries at any physicality. It's not fun to watch. He's leading the NBA down a dark path. I'm scared for when Zion is gonna start playing that way. He almost has to to protect himself and that is going to effectively end my fandom of the NBA. Shouldn't be an acting show. Should be basketball. They gotta fix it or the ratings will not improve."
"Ya know, bully ball might actually be right. If you read, I said they're one of the best teams in the league. They could be the best show on television. But they take bully to mean be physically aggressive except when a parent (ref) is looking. Then whine that they were hit.   You can't call yourself strong and then cry at every bit of contact or any call called against you (no matter how much you reached in and pulled Moss Point's arm hair.)  If you think it has anything to do with that trade, buddy I've detested Lebron's style of play since he started treading into these waters in miami, then went full sail with it in Cleveland. His whininess when he's the most talented athlete in the league made me actually root for the warriors over his sorry ass. At least they're fun to watch.   That shit last night? I'd be disgusted if Zion played like that. I personally couldn't care less for most of the players on the court. Moss Point always been a jackass since high school and his Suns aren't really a team that I enjoy, but damn if he didn't gain some respect for making the worst ref in the league earn that ejection.   That's how bad Lebron's playstyle is. His whining (because it works and gives a competitive advantage with these shit refs) has cause a bunch of players to become unlikeable and actually made me give props to Devin Booker."
"Whenever someone tries to deflect from the argument by bringing up another team into it, you know they're at a loss for words. And no, Devin Booker had a very inefficient game 2 as well until he made a bunch of free throws in the closing two minutes or so."
"15/5/3 on 43/36/80 at 21 years old, he'll be fine we just have no spacing and can't get the same looks he got last year - sophomore slump after a 60 day off-season maybe he's not the next Devin Booker but he can still be a high quality player."
"LeBron is likely done with the Olympics. He’s done alot more than other players of his caliber.   KD is likely done too. He already has two gold medals, not sure a third one would affect his legacy any.   It’ll probably be younger guys like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Bam. Which I’m totally fine with lol"
"The Suns are not going anywhere until Devin Booker takes the next step and becomes at least the 2nd best player in this series. He's basically in the third tier of stars right now, and he seems to have regressed this year."
"Man, it's *hard* to be the less likable team when you're playing the Lakers.  But CP3 and Devin Booker are sure as hell making an effort. Nobody can accuse them of not trying."
Devin Booker to the Wolves after he rage quits on  the Suns  for getting eliminated by Lebron. They spend  the rest of their careers playing warzone and earning hundreds  of millions from the Wolves while living together in   a big ass mansion fucking IG models.
Devin Booker will never win a ring.
"remember that video of Devin Booker in practice saying ""no double teams in practice""?   at the time I defended him because I was thinking there's not much to work on there, just pass out of it. but after watching this series, he really doesn't know how to handle a double team, definitely needs to practice it."

"Schroeder shot the ball with 5 seconds left on the shot clock, is he supposed to just let the shot clock run out for a TO? This happened because of Devin Booker, not Schroeder. You're victim blaming."
It was a bush league move when I saw the Lakers do with  JJ Barea 10 years ago and was a bush league move when I saw it happened to Kyle Schroeder last night I understand Devin Booker was probably really frustrated with how he played last night but that's not an excuse to give up on playing basketball and just try to start hurting people

"Devin ""Grayson Allen"" Booker"
"Bron moreso stop Embiid’s forward progress and with no ill intent, Devin literally had been talking shit to shroeder a couple possessions before using a full force push as soon as he left the ground. Intent should be a factor at play too. Your natural reaction is to protect yourself from a barreling man the size of a grizzly bear or move out the way, but he had a lapse in split second judgment. Booker just looked like he was aggravated by losing.    Bron’s was bad no doubt, but his actions don’t exempt Booker’s who’s were obviously worse."

Booker also tripped KCP earlier this year - was only called for a common foul too. Dirty Devin
"Some players are on fire during the playoffs every year, he wasn't gonna be the next Devin Booker because he got hot for 1,5 months, just like he isnt a bust because of a tough sophomore season.  I never believed that he had an insane ceiling, but I don't believe he can't be a good NBA starter either now.  &amp;#x200B;  And honestly Bam and Jimmy are a much bigger problem right now for Miami, because for Herro it's about shot going in or out, for Bam and Jimmy it seems more about ""ugh they just can't get any good shot"""
"Devin Booker a bitch, especially when he was crying because he got double team in a pick up game"
Just name the fucking dog “Devin Booker” so there’s no ambiguity!
Booker obviously. I’m strictly anti giving dogs human names.  Booker is a dope dog name. Devin... not so much.
Is the dog named devin or Booker
"I can't believe I was rooting for Suns for them to get into the playoffs the past few years. Devin Booker, CP3, and Jae Crowder have been dirty this game. Lost a lot of respect for them."
"In August 2019, a video of Devin Booker went viral where he refused to play against double teams in open runs. In hindsight, Devin should have practiced against them.  https://youtu.be/e0UuLnHSgeY"
Devin Booker-T
Devin Booker is the only reason the Suns have even won a game this series lol
"""Devin will be trying to cry to refs one more time in the parking lot"" lmao bruh  I will say, Booker is proving more and more he's a serious hot head. I know he's young and this is his first playoff series, but he got heated a lot during the regular season too."
Emotional lesbian Devin Booker? Yeah
Suspend Devin Booker
Fuck Devin Booker and fuck Jae Crowder
Fuck Devin Booker
Devin Booker a little bitch 😂 glad that smug smile got wiped
lmfao devin booker
No dog in the fight but Devin Booker is such a lil bitch
Devin “don’t double team me pls daddy” Booker
Chris Paul is teaching Devin Booker bad habits.
Devin Booker a whole ass bitch
Suspend devin booker
lmao Devin Booker a lil bitch
Devin Booker becomes a little bitch when he's losing.
"Nobody gets more bullshit, unimportant free throws than Devin Booker"
Wow Devin Booker literally rage quitting lol
Devin Booker trick y’all man
is devin booker playing today
Devin Booker is only 24!!?? I feel like he's been playing for like 8 years already lol
Devin booker has to play better
Devin booker whines so much it’s it’s shocking it took this long for a tech
"The Devin Booker play, and the Schroeder and AD play are the same play but only the Lakers got freethrows????"
Devin “Tyler Herro” Booker
"Devin Booker could have 10 Kendalls, stop the cap"
devin booker botta go get his ass ate by kendall at HT to recharge
"Devin Booker is broken, man. He’s gotta stop forcing shots."
Is it hot in Staples or is it just Devin Booker?
devin booker gotta start zoning in. been getting his ass ate by kendall too often
Did devin booker shoot that? Should he really be at the line rn?
Tyler “Devin Booker” Herro
Does it count as 4 on 2 when Chris Paul is standing next to Devin Booker in the corner?
Am I the only that doesnt buy into Devin Booker hype?
Devin Booker
God damn Devin Booker is fucking Kobe reincarnated
"Doesn’t matter that he’s got facial hair, Devin Booker looks like he’s still learning his ABCs"
imagine have Devin Booker and Chris Paul on your roster and crying about flopping and whining to the refs
"Looking at Devin Booker, I thought he was latino."
RIP Devin Booker. Your career ended too soon.
So who's the highest scorer of the playoffs so far.   One of the Nets big 3?  Devin Booker?
Bro wtf is Devin Booker wearing
"welp, the butler didnt do it.  game over. blow up the team tbh  shop butler. get devin booker imo."
"Some advanced stats this year paint them as pretty similarly poor defenders. If you compare their third year stats Trae is ahead in most defensive stats and only slightly below in others. Devin Booker has had a lot more time to improve his defense than Trae has. They look about the same to the eye test, though if you get Trae in isolation against a switch he’s more likely to get cooked, but I bet Trae can stick to quick 1’s better than Book can."
You see him hit that midrange? The next Devin Booker
Yes we are delusional. Not you heat fans that praised Herro to be the next James Harden or Devin Booker
The question was which one would you rather have to start a team. Not which one would you rather have right this moment. I still think Devin booker has a higher ceiling than trae based purely on physics traits. How many guys that are below 6’0 (no shoes) and below 200 pounds have won championships as lead guys?
NEXT DEVIN BOOKER
Devin Booker even tho I truly believe that Trae is offensively better and more skilled. i just believe that Devin’s height actually does matter
I’m shocked that a Clippers fan can say this. I’ve checked your game threads when you play us and it’s all just Devin Booker slander
"Dame started being recognized because he started campaigning for himself as an all star in the media.  Lebron does this every year with MVP and DPOY this season.  Devin Booker starts crying about not making the all star team and he's in the next year.  Bradley Beal cries because he missed the all star team averaging the most points ever by someone who didn't make it. Next season he's starting.  If Trae wants the attention, he's gotta create some drama."
"Devin Booker, I was nuetral on the suns but dude can really ball out  Jo Morant seems like he can only go up, I'd be so mad at the universe if he reached his ceiling early. I know in life you should manage expectations but I see him being a super star   Harden, never saw him play too much and was infamous for flopoing but maaan during that time he was in the top 5 mvp race he was looking lethal. Harden was just steam rolling through the league, that west coast road trip where they beat everyone was spooky cos every win you could just add **they're missing kevin durant tho** felt like the opening scene of a horror movie, truly scary hours"
"Devin Booker has absolutely not been the best player in this series lol. Best scorer, maybe, but LeBron has been better in literally every single other aspect of the game."
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here’s the 24 players I have before him, and I can’t see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you’d have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren’t injured."
He is the Devin Booker of point guards: really goddamn good and people pretend he's not
"I would say trae young (hawks) , embiid (sixers), and a maybe in Devin booker (suns)"
Does Devin booker have any chance of being the face of the league?
"I think Devin Booker is their best player, but CP3 is the reason they win games and are the #2 seed"
Devin Booker wincing at the thought
Fucking insane someone can get ejected for nothing even with replay. Also Devin Booker isn't and never will be Kobe. Stop trying to make that happen
"I've always liked Devin Booker, glad to see him finally getting what he deserves. As a fellow Devin I am proud."
"Devin Booker has not scored a point since saying ""this is my time to prove it""''.  I will update you again tomorrow."
DEVIN BOOKER FACT #173816  DEVIN “THICK STACKS AND FAT RACKS” BOOKER HAS AN 11 INCH PENIS
Devin Booker is doing a fantastic job for his 1st taste of the playoffs
Devin Booker scored the 7th most points in the league this year. that qualifies as a centerpiece imo
"Same could be said for Chris Paul or Devin Booker. No one is “stopping” these players, you can only mitigate their impact. And if that’s what you meant, then Mikal Bridges."
NBA Bubble legend Devin Booker is now 8-2 in his playoff career.
"I like Booker. A lot. But when Jokic stared him in his eyes, Devin went from hard to frustrated punk ass in about 4 seconds"
"The sun's are my team. CP3 i have over curry in the all time rankings. I would let Devin Booker smash me or my girl.  But Jamal is a bad man. And he absolutely cooks the sun's. The second best player (and known playoff baller) absolutely would make a difference. It sucks for Denver, but they have a very legitimate shot at the title for the next few years if they can stay healthy"
"""Thats bullshit man"" - Devin Booker"
https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/boston-celtics/boston-celtics-jae-crowder-phoenix-suns-devin-booker-exchange-instagram-barbs-following-70-point-game   Glad him and Booker squashed whatever this was.  Dudes been legit.
"Low key, Jokix kinda bitches Devin Booker out"
"No it would be like if the nuggets got swept and chris paul or devin Booker was out, just like KD was out for the warriors"
Just wait until people realize that even if you take away CP3 &amp; Ayton there Devin Booker is waiting on the perimeter.  That play with that team is damn near unguardable
Devin Armani “14 Incher” Booker
I wish we had Devin Booker instead of Jaylen Brown. Booker is so much better.
Devin Booker did not win 4 straight games in 335 games prior to the bubble.   Today he completed his first playoff sweep and is on a 7 game win-streak in the playoffs
Especially by Devin Booker of all people. Dude is so cringy.
I think Jokic looking like he was ready to murder Devin Booker also played into the refs decision making
Devin “Mandate of Heaven” Booker
"Devin booker, ayton, and trae young have had one hell of a first playoff year."
Devin Booker has NEVER been knocked out in the first two rounds of the playoffs
Devin Booker has never been eliminated in the playoffs
And if devin Booker wins finals mvp over him?
Suns came a long way since Stephen A suggested that Devin Booker should have himself kidnapped.
Devin Booker high-fiving and hugging fans that traveled with the team is the coolest shit
They really gave Devin Booker CHRIS PAUL and they thought they wouldn't make much noise in the west
"Reggie is right, that Devin Booker screen was nasty"
"Devin “Big like Klay, Screen like Curry”  Booker."
Joker was about to eat Devin Booker. Seen that look before.
Devin Booker is a rat faced little shit.
I’m sure there are some tough American NBA players but Devin Booker is not one of them.
I mean you could make a case for that I’m not gonna argue it it. But isn’t it insanely ironic that the person who gets in his Face Is DEVIN BOOKER. That man cannot keep his cool whatsoever
you leave the part out where devin booker got into his face lol. not like joker went looking for someone.
"“If it wasn’t for me, Devin Booker would still be selling meat off the back of a truck in Minneapolis”"
"in a way with the suns being this dominant I wouldnt mind the suns winning the championship. We can say we lost to the winner, neither the clippers or the nets end up getting it, and devin booker whos game reminds me of kobe becomes a household name and bitch paul finally gets past that barrier that has been eluding him his entire career and shows that yes, the problem really was james harden being a prolapsed anus that didnt allow that houston team to succeed. if milwaukee gets eliminated the suns are my go to for the championship"
Jokic grew up in Serbia. He would literally eat Devin Booker for breakfast and ask for extra hot sauce to spice it up
Devin Booker gets a lot of technicals.
"Imagine if Devin Booker said ""get ready to go the fuck home"" and the Nuggets came back from 0-3."
We live in a society - Devin booker
Devin Booker is fake hard
Devin Booker is a man for standing up for his teammate. Love to see it.
"They have Chris Paul and Devin Booker. Not sure what you’re talking about.  But to the other person’s question, probably the 03-04 Pistons."
"Thats facts, Devin Booker been loyal as fuck."
Ppl are delusional if they think devin booker is the next kobe
Is Devin Booker a true superstar?
I'm a simple Suns fan. Ever since the 70 pt game I just literally want Devin Booker to score every time he touches the ball lol
I’m glad the world is finally seeing how good Devin Booker is at this sport
Devin booker dropping 20 in the first quarter GURANTEE
KD is furiously texting Devin Booker
"Purely in terms of shooting, he'd be no different than what Devin Booker is now. Booker's an average 3-point shooter who kills it from mid-range."
"no i’ve watched most jazz &amp; suns games this year, devin booker is one of my fav players in the nba but he just can’t do what donavon can do on the floor"
So should devin booker be getting mvp votes? He averaged similar numbers to Spida on way better efficiency.
If you pay attention you notice a lot of players really only like to drive to one side of the court. Makes guys like devin booker or kyrie who can attack either side or use either hand seem even more impressive
"Suns aren’t winning anything either. lol. Shitty ass defense? You mean like the kind devin booker plays? I’m not rooting against your team because I hate them, I’m rooting against them because they’re boring as hell"
"Yeah its a bad scheme, i think anyone else on the suns would make less tha. half on those shots. Especially with defenders who are closing out on the shooter. Cp3 makes the shot look easy since hes in control, but anyone else even devin booker might look like hes rushing his shot."
"The thing you don't see is what having Jamal in does for everyone else on the court.  He gives MPJ space to get good uncontested shots off, without Jamal there is no reason anyone should ever leave Mike alone.  Without Jamal AG can't find the back cuts that are opened up when Jamal/Jokic get into their two man game.  He absolutely feasted on those plays when he first joined the Nuggets.    The game changes entirely when he is on the court, even before you account for his 25+ pts.  Yes, the Nuggets rose to the challenge when he went down, we kept winning games.  But if your argument is that we are nearly as good without Jamal as we are with him you are actually insane.    Take CP3 off the Suns, right now.  Are they anywhere near the team they are right now?  Of course not.  Losing your second best player (by miles) is huge, and it cascades through the entire roster as players are asked to fill different roles than they aren't comfortable with.  Can Devin Booker drop those 40+ pt games if he is also saddled with primary ball handler responsibilities cause CP3 is out?    Don't be ridiculous."
"Your first statement doesn't even make sense at all. Are you saying the Suns shouldn't have looked to improve the team? Obviously CP3 makes them better and the assets they gave away weren't all that great.   No one is denying CP3's impact but he's not CLEARLY the Suns best player. Devin Booker took down the number one defense in the league when Chris Paul was playing on one arm and averaging just 9 points per game. He's averaging 27/6/5 on 62% TS in the playoffs so far.  OKC got rid of Gallo, Schroder, and Steven Adams. SGA also missed majority of the season. Of course, the Thunder got a lot worse. Not sure why you're making it seems like Chris was the only piece missing from that team."
"Having a lot of friends in the media and being a great leader has finally paid dividends, after spending the majority of his prime being underrated, CP3 suddenly is overrated.  He's been at an All NBA level for sure, all the MVP talk is a pure joke, that team is good, that team only missed the playoffs last year because Ayton got suspended 25 games, that team killed everyone with CP3 off the floor too this season, that team won a playoff series with CP3 playing with one shoulder. Devin Booker is awesome (probably a better player than CP3 at this point), Mikal Bridges is one of the best 3&amp;D guy in the league, Ayton has been awesome, the role players are all good, the team is deep, Monty is a great coach : can everybody stop acting like this is some sort of 2009 NOLA carry job by CP3 ?"
"I’d rather have devin booker and Ayton 10 times out of 10 than an aging CP3, he’s not even the 2nd best on the team"
"&gt; It is FAR FAR FAR harder to find an efficient 2nd option 20+ point scorer than it is to find a role player.     &gt;  The irony is MPJ has similarities to Booker.    MPJ is putting up 17ppg in the playoffs with 50%+ of his scoring coming from 3's.  He's not Devin Booker, he's not creating his own shots in the mid-range like Book is and has been doing since his 2nd year in the league.    MPJ's offense is the very definition of a high level role player....open 3's and dunks created by Jokic."
"not like he won 2 straight MVPs and 60+ wins, and go to the finals with dog shit teams before playing with those guys  nah you're right, lebron was devin booker before going to Miami lmao"
Nah man. Jason Terry &gt; devin booker
"Lol dirk would’ve loved to have this roster in 2011, so much better  I mean you got a number 1 pick, devin booker, a lockdown young defender in bridges and more. CP3 isn’t even the clear cut best player on the team"
"Every single other player in the NBA DOESNT get that benefit of the doubt is my point. You just have a victim complex on this. Devin Booker (and Donovan Mitchell) are getting attention as the best players on their team, when they aren’t even that."
CP3? DPOY? Donovan Mitchell? Devin Booker?   You ain't a NBA fan.
"&gt; but the lack of superstar talent is bumming me out for this series  * gobert is a 4x DPOY * CP3 has like a 25:1 assist to turnover rate at 36 * Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are two of the biggest scorers in the game  what the fuck do you mean no superstar talent lmao  they might not be superstars yet, but they have the talent and they'll get there. this is the series that will push them further"

Devin Booker and Harden doing just fine
"1. Nikola Jokic 2. Derrick Rose 3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis 5. Joe Ingles         Joker is fresh on my mind after the game but I tried to avoid putting on the really really young guys like Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker excetera, as far as Joe Ingles I like the what can I say lol"
Devin Booker elite
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker 3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton
Devin Booker has entered that chat
Lmao they’ve had a starting backcourt of Facu campazzo and Austin rivers go against Dame and CJ followed by Chris Paul and devin Booker
"I can't compare this to 2011 Mavs, Dirk Nowitzki did not have Devin Booker and Deandre ayton lol, but obviously it depends, it looks like things are actually going to go in the reverse for Chris Paul this year where he benefits from the other teams injuries, but if he beats a healthy Jazz and a healthy Brooklyn that's obviously going to lift his legacy a lot, but honestly the person who it would benefit the most might be Devin Booker, if Devin Booker just balls out and somehow even gets a Finals MVP she will have an immediate bragging rights over his other young peers in the game"
Devin Booker pretty clearly showed why he’s better in the Lakers series
The new rivalry of the future is Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker.
I think there's a difference between having devin booker as your costar compared to Jason Terry but hey
"AKA ""teammates that Devin Booker should have carried to the playoffs as a 21 year old if he was actually good""  /s"
"If monty wasn't COTY, and Devin Booker was an injury-replacement all star, then James Jones pretty much has to be EOTY because why else would we be good?"
"The 13th pick is always an interesting one, too. Karl Malone (1985), Jalen Rose (1994), Kobe (1996), Zach LaVine (2014), Devin Booker (2015), and Donovan Mitchell (2017).   Also some recent guys with decent careers so far, from Ed Davis (2010) to Markieff Morris (2011) to Kelly Olynyk (2013) to Tyler Herro (2019).  Fair share of duds though, with Papagiannis (2016), Kendall Marshall (2012), Jerome Robinson (2018), and most of the 2000s picks save Richard Jefferson and Thabo."
Devin Booker empty stats guy - won’t translate in post season
i hate devin booker
"interesting...  I think your second round seems right to me, but that means:  \- Suns have LeBron and Jokic  \- Clippers have Luka and I think Gobert (over Ja)  \- Sixers have Beal and Trae (over Randle)  \- Nets have Tatum and Giannis  I say the Suns and Nets win. So my WCF champ would be the suns:  C Nikola Jokic  PF LeBron James  SF Kawhi Leonard  SG Devin Booker  PG Chris Paul  vs the ECF Champ, the Nets  C Joel Embiid  PF Giannis Antetokounmpo  SF Kevin Durant  SG James Harden  PG Kyrie Irving  6th man: Jayson Tatum  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Suns actually win with their playmaking, but thats a clash of the titans - especially with the the front court scoring and back court defense of the Nets."
“I mean I think we’re peaking at the right time. I wouldn’t say we’re peaking.” -Devin Booker
Devin Booker PP big and hard
Devin Booker hasnt even made an all-star game yet because everyone dismissed him on a bad team
55 Points from the Suns starting backcourt of Devin Booker and Chris Paul.
ESPN is even making Devin Booker wait for commercial
Devin Booker can win with these cats
"cp3 could have gone to the kobe-led lakers  he may not have, but he got devin booker"
Devin Booker is playing on another level.
Devin Booker is playing on another level
Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker    #BOOK IT!!!!!!!! (STEPHEN A. SMITH VOICE)
Devin Booker is cool and good
"Devin Booker face doesn't belong in his body, its offsetting he looks like he should be irish or something"
...*devin booker is probably a top 10 player*
man devin booker vs donovan mitchell in the wcf could be legendary shit with how they’ve both been playing in these playoffs
Oh my Devin Booker... Oh my!!!
Devin Booker Qdog confirmed
"Devin Booker ""woof woof"""
"If the Bucks pull through, this is going to be the most conflicting Finals I've watched in 15 years less the Raptors run as a Canadian.  I want Giannis to get one, I want Brook to get one, I want Jrue to get one, I want PJ to get one, but Devin Booker is my favorite SG in the game right now other than DeMar, CP is one of my favorite PGs, Mikal Bridges was huge in me winning fantasy (he also has the most Brandon Roy voice ever), and I'm a huge fan of DA.  Gonna be a good one."
"First off, I feel like I need to clarify overall that my initial point is that they both have intangible benefits attached to them to a level that you see few other players in their sport do.   I am not making a direct Tom and Chris comparison. Not sure  NOW, that being said, let's go:  \&gt; That's ignoring that the Suns in the bubble went 8-0 against their opponents,  Definitely not ignoring that?  \&gt; This team was already considered to be playoff contenders before adding Chris Paul  You're correct - they were like +4-5000 for the title (9th best in West) and had an o/u of 38.5 wins (7th in the west) before the season.   Those odds were *after they added* Chris Paul, though. So they were just kind of playoff contenders *after* adding him as well.  \&gt; it's not like he single handedly turned the franchise around.   I'm also not making that argument.  \&gt; Booker and Ayton were balling since the bubble started.  We were all there for the bubble, and I think people reacted appropriately given the Vegas odds above.  We're talking about being 1 game back of *having the best record in the entire league.*   Ayton has had a fucking incredible playoffs, which is great, but [he's redirecting it](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/27/ayton-on-chris-paul-he-was-the-best-thing-that-happened-to-my-career/) all to Chris, [who is hyping him up](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10006574-suns-chris-paul-on-deandre-ayton-contract-hes-gonna-get-him-a-bag-this-summer).   Him and Book are great young players that also [Facetime CP3 like he's their Dad](https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/clippers-suns-devin-booker-deandre-ayton-facetime-chris-paul-after-game-1-win) after games.   My point with Chris is, is he worth what the Knicks are probably going to pay him on the court? Hell no.  But there are very, very few guys in the NBA who are to the point of where you can look at their value beyond just their on floor production and Chris is one of them.  Worth the money? I don't know. But it was a fun intellectual exercise.   \-----------------  I'm not comparing him directly to Tom. It sucks people think I am, and I have a full comment about him elsewhere that spurred the Chris point that I can't find right now, but whatever.   Really wish I could find the comment as it obviously generates some great discussion!"
What're you smoking?  I'm talking about Devin Booker.
Devin Booker from wish.com
"I still have KAT&gt;. Ik Ayton is a much more balanced 2 way player as he’s both offense/defense and he’s currently in the finals while timberwolves are at the bottom. But here’s my reasoning. In this era, I will always value offense&gt;defense, that’s why I have jokic as the best center in the league and not Bam or Ayton or embiid and that’s why I have Curry as the best point guard in the league and not jrue holiday or Chris Paul. Ayton is an extremely efficient scorer (and I’m not saying this is the only way he can score) but most of his points are coming from standing in the dunker’s spot and having someone drive and give him a wide open layup. Is he good at it? Absolutely but I believe that this wouldn’t work if he was the main option on his team. If this team had no Chris Paul or devin booker, he would be in the same situation as KAT. The thing about KAT is that he’s much more capable of creating his own shot, more so than ayton. If the defense number 1 priority became ayton, and they started double teaming/face guarding him, I’m not sure he’d be able to do anything. That’s just my two cents. Obviously ayton is very good and I’m not taking away what he’s doing"
For me it's Moody (really doubt Presti takes him based on his MO in the draft though)  Bouknight is interesting though. More of a Presti pick than Moody but not as much as Kuminga and Barnes  I think he is a project too in his own way (playmaking and shot selection is less than ideal for a guard) but athleticism/shot creation gives me some Zach Lavine/Devin Booker vibes  Moreover it's easier for me to project him as a go to option in today's guard driven league than it is a guy like Barnes--whose ceiling assuming his shooting doesn't magically improve suggest a high end role player ceiling like a current Ben Simmons or Draymond (who is really good but I doubt we are talking about him as a star if he doesn't have three of the greatest shooters ever around him) rather than a 1st/2nd/even 3rd scoring option in today's superteam era on a championship team
Trae Young is not better than Devin Booker jesus fucking christ
Devin Booker is the closest facsimile to Kobe I have and it warms my heart every single time he takes a fucking step closer to being a legend.  Fuck 50 points. Fuck 60 points. Book scoring 80 points and winning 10 ships would make me happy.
"He was absolutely garbage at drafting. TJ Warren, Devin Booker &amp; DeAndre Ayton are the only ones he hit on  Len is very meh for a top-5 pick, but tbh the 2013 draft was a shitshow for most of the lottery anyway.  Then he drafted Dragan Bender with the 4th pick in 2016, as if that wasn't enough went and took Papagiannis &amp; Labissiere as well. So thats 3 useless 7-foot bums in 1 draft. He then packaged Bogdanovic/Papagiannis/Labissiere for Chriss  Blew top another top-5 pick in 2017, this time for Josh Jackson who was the prototypical uber-athletic knucklehead wing. Jackson lasted only 2 years before he was dumped to Memphis  And I'm pretty sure the only good trades he ever made was trading Scola for Gerald Green (who was a valuable part of that 48-win team in 2014) &amp; trading Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges"
"Ryan McDonough took over when the team was struggling to stay competitive and relevant and went all in on a roster that widely exceeded expectations. He thought the Suns were closer than they actually were and then played his hand by bringing in an over the hill Tyson Chandler in efforts to lure LaMarcus Aldridge. That didn’t work and the team came back to earth the following season. By then it was too late. Losing took its toll on the locker room and we went from bad to laughably bad. When it was clear that it was time to move on, he spent far too long drafting raw prospects that didn’t have a chance on a dysfunctional team.   Devin Booker became who he is not because of the Suns, but rather, in spite of the Suns.    I say this and I mean every last word of it. Ryan McDonough was one of the worst GMs in the history of the league."
"Now I’m just picturing [this](https://youtu.be/bGq95Fadve8?t=244), but Devin Booker."
I want Devin booker  Mom: we have Devin booker at home
That’s not devin booker
Devin Booker.
"Well, I guess Devin Booker is better than KD 😐"
"Considering he did a stellar job on both Mitchell and booker it’s kinda weird to argue he doesn’t deserve his defensive reputation. His three main assignments based on possession were Devin Booker, Mitchell and clarkson. He held them to 28%, 23% and 33% shooting.   No one guarded booker more in the playoffs than Patrick Beverly so it’s not a small sample size.   Does he do dumb shit? Yes. But that doesn’t mean he’s isn’t a high level defender."
"I’m sayin bro, no offense to anybody here but nobody wants to watch Devin booker vs Pat coughington or whatever it is in the fucking finals, I watched 30 seconds of tonight’s game and turned it off"
"You mean the 25.5 pts, 5.8 rebounds, 4.7 assists average per game in the WCF Devin Booker? Some lockdown. 🙄"
"Almost like the Suns have a relatively balanced roster with solid contributors in the roation.  The team as a whole was top 10 in both offense and defense. Chris's impact goes far beyond what you see in the box score and that'd exactly why Monty Williams and the front office wanted to bring him to Phoenix. His influence on the young players is palpable and his pairing with Devin Booker is a great fit. Everybody thought that the Suns inexperience would be their downfall. Chris Paul and Jae Crowder helped avoid that. Shit, Chris Paul has been one of the best closers in the game for years at this point."
"Yeah, and they got a guy that most people consider a better player than Devin Booker and got pretty insane injury luck. Devin Booker didn't spontaneously develop into a player capable of leading a team to this level.  Any teambuilding strategy starts to look good if you just spontaneously land an All-NBA player."
"I mean, until this year Devin Booker hadn't made the playoffs in his entire career. Sometimes it takes a while for a guy to mature talent wise and to build a good team."
There’s a mean tweet that says “Devin Booker looks like a hipster lesbian” . He got so offended by that.
"I mean, in all fairness, the Devin Booker nose break was pretty obviously 100% an accident. Not sure it belongs in the same category as the other examples."
Well**one** of them was suggested as a trade for Devin Booker and it wasn't MPJ. /s
"lol nobody on this sub watches clippers games. pat bev was absolutely clamping devin booker throughout the whole series, you can find the 1-on-1 stats yourself. youre emotional though, i understand"
https://www.pamasic.com/products/devin-booker-1-phoenix-suns-hardwood-classics-jersey-black?variant=1000004891469523&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIle6H6fLC8QIV8_3jBx0HgAkLEAQYBCABEgLZAPD_BwE  My dude the throwbacks would be perfect
"Asterisks only mean anything to petty teenagers trolling /r/nba, ask Devin Booker or CP3 if they're ashamed to be here right now, or fans with Finals tickets for the first time in 30 years. If Trae or Giannis want to over sleep and miss game 1 of the Finals, we'll take that too. It's house money anyways, most Suns fans considered a 2nd round exit as successful year in the pre-season threads"
"“I thought I knew what the group might need, that we didn’t need a big team talk,” said Devin Booker. “It was LA at home. I thought please don’t go on about the Clippers, we all know what the Clippers are about, they are nice and tidy but we’ll fucking do them. Chris Paul came in and said: ‘Lads, it’s the Clippers’, and that was it. Brilliant.”"
Yeah the stat padding thing is situational. Stuff like the Ricky Davis thing seem like the bad side of stat padding. Also the Devin Booker 70 point game always felt weird because of how it was achieved.
"Not sure if this should mitigate the lack of sportsmanship, but the suns were kinda being jerks to both LA teams at the end of each of the LA series’.   There was the salsa dancing, the devin booker dunk with like 90 seconds left, cp3 talking to the clippers bench, devin booker chirping with clippers fans, etc..  That’s gotta make it even harder for the 2 guys who are gonna get all the blame for losing, to shake hands with the winning team. But yeah at the end of the day I doubt the suns care and it won’t affect anyone’s legacy."
"I think he was not being properly utilized (especially by Saunders) on top of being the primary vet on the youngest (2nd youngest?) team in the league. Dude was clearly being stretched thin and was trying to teach half the starters defense in-game. To really sum it up I think he was being asked to do way more than he ever should have been instead of just being told to just play his game. Not to mention the DLo/Rubio rotations were just never quite figured out (again, especially under saunders. We’ll see more of Finch’s vision after the offseason). As far as I understand it Rosas brought Rubio back to provide Anthony Edwards with the mentoring that Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker benefitted from. It totally worked too as the Ant/Rubio bromance is very real. Rubio got a ton of slander from other Timberwolves fans but I feel like it was pretty obvious he was being asked to do way too much (you would literally see him basically coaching players in between plays). If our coaches just asked him to play his game I think he’s the same player he always was, but they didn’t, so he wasn’t.  Edit: to be clear these are all just my takes on the situation and to answer your last question: I don’t think they trade him unless they get a solid offer. Definitely not looking to unload him. His relationship with Ant and the fact that Ant has a crazy amount of potential means they’re kind of a package deal in my eyes. Plus I would personally love to see Rubio retire in a Wolves jersey."
"Devin ""Next Kobe Bryant"" Booker with the scorching hot sub 50% TS% 🔥🔥🔥"
"Well without Booker the job gets much harder for CP3, than it does in reverse, imo. Obviously that's not quantifiable and neither take is wrong, but if Book were out I don't think CP3 would be able to create the way he does. Booker got 41mpg to CP3's 37mpg, it's because the Suns have to ride his ability to create a shot at will in order to open up the rest of the offense. There are no bad takes here, honestly, CP3 is a god, Devin Booker is the man."
LOL he fully looked cp3 and pushed him tho. Who was it meant for? Devin Booker? Suns medical staff?
"Because Jae Crowder and Devin Booker are very close to dealing with a one game suspensions because of technicals and it's not worth blowing it because Patrick Beverly decided to have a hissy fit.  If Frank steps in and hits PatBev, who the fuck knows what happens. An all out brawl with ejections and suspensions across the board maybe. It was the right move for the team to make to not try and snap PatBev."
"My friend says Booker's eyes creep him out  ""Lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at you, doesn't seem to be livin'"" - my friend on Devin Booker"
You mean when Tyler Herro becomes black Devin Booker
The one player on the team who I will always complain about not getting a fair whistle is Devin Booker. I'm surprised he hasn't sustained more injuries the way he gets hacked when he drives.
Devin Booker would be struggling against my defense if I was allowed to break his nose and reach in on every possession.
"average game score is skewed because its 4 games vs 6 games.  So 1 elite game from CP3 (which he had) tilts the scales more than 1 elite game from Booker.  Ironic that you say +/- over 6 games is meaningless but game score over 4 is?  It'd be one thing if CP3 had strung of a few elite games, but he did not do enough to be more important than Devin Booker this series - because he missed the first 2 games."
You would want a guy like that because he plays defense devin booker struggled against him at times. No my argument is nothing like that it's not like this thread was made because of an off court issue my argument is like defending a way more safe vontaze burfit
Can Devin Booker have his own jumpshot now?
"Couldn’t be worse. And suns fans wonder why I despise their team. Between Chris Paul and devin Booker, they have 2 of the least likeable stars in the league. If Giannis or trae is out for the finals it’s pointless to watch them tbh"
Ima fix Wolves   - Finals MVP Devin Booker
"&gt; so if booker doesn't go 5-16 with 8 tov they lose game 2 huh  Yes Devin booker literally made a jumper with like 20 seconds left to put them up 1.  It was a pretty clutch bucket and proved vital because PG answered on the other end.  Ayton had the great tip in but Booker kept them in that game when other couldn't. The team almost collapsed when he had to leave to deal with his nose.  Booker had 20 points and a +4 despite the low FG% and turnovers.  He wasn't having a good shooting game but he was doing what needed to be done to win.  But your argument seems to have strayed.  If the question is ""did Booker or Chris Paul have a better series"", the answer is Booker.  Simply because Booker played 2 more games, 1/3 of the series.    Also, Bookers +/- was +13 on the series, CP3's was -5 despite having such a great game 6.  It really shows how little of an impact he had in the other games.  To say Chris Paul had a better series than Book is literally just feeling the heat of the moment from last night. It was a totally epic performance from him, but Booker was the better player through the whole series."
"I am/was a PG hater, but it doesn't mean he didn't ball out this postseason. And he definitely played his ass off. He had 100 more minutes played than the next guy (Devin Booker!) so he definitely doesn't deserve shit for this series being a loss. Not this time.  I still stand by clowning him previously though."
This makes it even better lmfao   Can’t wait for people to start blaming it on Devin Booker.
The measure of one's success depends on the context in which the endeavor takes place. Tanking despite having Devin Booker putting up amazing scoring outputs places a higher bar of success than regular tanking. And the only reason we're having this conversation right now is because the Suns are in the finals. Even Suns fans wouldn't be calling the season a resounding success if they lost in the first round.
Devin booker was the 13th pick of the draft. No one plans  to get pick 13 lol.
"I think the Pandemic P jokes need to be put to rest. He played nearly the equivalent of 3 FULL playoff games more than the second closest player in minutes (Devin Booker). He closed out the number 1 seed without Kawhi, and won two games on the Suns without him as well. I’m not sure what more you could ask of him.   Idk why people like Shannon Sharpe or other haters keep comparing him to Lebron or KD when he’s never been in that tier of players. He’s a Robin and there’s nothing wrong with that."
"the year is 2021. 2x0+2-1 = 1. That's Devin Bookers number, and coincidentally the number of times Booker has made the finals as well"
Devin Booker has entered the chat
"yeah dont get me wrong I don't like Pat Bev but the person you responded to is making stupid arguments but the nature of the thread is such that it will get upvoted since it's an anti Pat Bev thread  ""He's not a good defender except he does a good job of shutting down Devin Booker and that's it"""
"I don’t care for Devin Booker either.  Jae Crowder is annoying as fuck too.   But I like Ayton, Cam Payne, and Cam Johnson a lot.  All of them showed so much poise."
"Devin Booker.  With CP3, I feel like his spot in the all time ranking is already pretty much fixed if he ends up with a ring, even without the FMVP.  With Ayton, I am not sure how he's gonna pan out in the next few years and if he's gonna creep up the all time ranking list.  But with Booker, a FMVP would do a lot for his legacy imo and potentially put him in the all time list depends on his performance and how his career pans out in the next decade or so. He already had a 70 pts game, so his name is gonna be up there with some greats on that list.  At the end of the day though, the best performer in the finals series gets it, I hope."
Devin Booker is at half court talkin to the fans
"I’ll explain.  The argument was that “ayton and booker are the best young duo in the game”  The response that tried to justify that statement over Tatum and brown being better was that the suns are in the finals.  Getting injured one out of five seasons does not make you a worse player, and being on a team where more people got injured especially doesn’t make you a worse player. The stupidity of this argument reeks of recency bias. If the whole suns team had caught covid because of an irresponsible staffer, no gm is changing their evaluation of ayton and booker as players and that didn’t make the suns any better or worse as a team. Just dumb luck.  Judging players on their amount of success in their most recent playoff run is such a weird way to judge individual players. So what, rookie jaylen brown in the ECF was a better player than Devin booker last season, because one made the playoffs and the other didn’t? Crowder is better than Levine because his teams was healthy and won?  The suns are a better team than the Celtics this year, especially with health factored in. I’m not sure who you think you’re replying to or what you’re reading."
Devin Booker all the way
Devin “empty stats” Booker out here
Booker? Crowder? CP3? On the same level as Bev and Mook? Ok lmao   What in the fuck has Devin Booker ever done
"If we win this year, Chris may get finals mvp and the media attention, but Suns fans will default to Devin Booker as the answer.  He's the guy. He's our franchise star. The player we successfully built around. The player that the front office bet on that paid off.  It would be like a Toronto situation. Kawhi is the Raptors best player, but Lowry is their greatest kind of thing."
"And CP3 wasn’t injured in the first few games against the Lakers? CP3 didn’t miss two games with covid? Devin Booker hasn’t been playing with a broken nose and Cam Payne didn’t twist his ankle?   I guess I’m just annoyed that when other teams are hurt it’s held against the suns, but when we’re injured and beat up no one seems to think that matters."
"Devin Booker is in the finals, Steph isn’t. Guess he’s better then Steph."
You type this as Devin Booker and Chris Paul take you to the finals. Two guys who have had similar tags attached to them but still made it work.
Devin Booker stats in Playoffs:  27 points/ 6.4 rebounds /4.8 assists on 44.4% from the Field and 33% from the three.  Luka: 33.5/9.5/8.8 on 49.4% FG and 39.2% from three.   Luka is way more efficient and has a considerably worst supporting cast lol.
devin booker is in the finals. lebron is not. devin booker is better than lebron
"In the 2015-16 season, the Suns (and rookie Devin Booker at the time) were one of the worst teams in the NBA at the time and ofc Chuck a former Suns great was not amused with his former team's incompetency. So on one of the Inside the NBA shows where the crew went over several games thru a Thursday night, the crew ended up having to recap a Suns-Rockets game that ended (I remember the exact year/season vividly because the Rockets were coached by Bickerstaff who is basically known as the bonafide NBA 'interim' head coach after a firing), where the Suns had very few national games at the time. And during the recap, Chuck was so fed up with the Suns (losing 24 of their last 25 games coming in) that he ended up going on a legendary rant slandering everything about the Suns that included Kevin Johnson/Dan Majerle rollin over their graves, ample parking, dirty seats, stale hot dogs and ugly cheerleaders and many more. And the killer statement by Chuck - instead of having Pickled Jalapenos on the proclaimed stale nachos, Chuck was disappointed that the Suns put **Pickles** on their Nachos instead. And of course everyone on the Inside the NBA set was dying of laughter during Chuck's entire rant"
Is it time to be worried about Devin Booker?
"Devin Booker deserves so much praise for sticking with his team, the team that drafted him, through all the horrible years that it took to get to this point.   This natural path to a championship is so much more substantive than the free agency super team bullshit.      GO SUNS!"
A first can be anything. Even a devin booker!!!
"He aint no Kobe. Like stfu. Devin booker cant perform against top defense, and he cant defend opponent too"
"I hated that this year. Towards the end of the season, I was like why isn’t anyone talking about the Suns? Because Devin Booker is ""too young"" and CP3 is ""too old""?"
"also Mitchell being a 6'1"" 2 vs Devin being 6'5"" makes positional defense tougher for the Jazz, while Booker can survive against bigger 2s and smaller 3s."
Because Devin Booker isn't a massive playoff bottler like DMitchell
"And Booker can’t defend bro. I fuck with Devin Booker and I hope the Suns win it all for CP3 and Monty, but he’s not better than Tatum"
"So I had to work tonight and couldn't watch the game. In fact, I actually forgot that there was even a game tonight at all. Anyway, I was out on a pizza delivery and I just so happened to glance up at the nearest building and had to do a double take because it was the CP3 basketball academy in Winston-Salem. I didn't even know that was a thing until today.   Then I come home and turn on the game and I see Chris Paul celebrating with Devin Booker and Monty Williams on the sideline as the final two minutes tick down. CP3 is going to the NBA Finals!  I grew up a Tar Heel, but always had a soft spot for Wake Forest, especially since as a kid I was able to go to a couple games with my dad as we got the tickets for free. Wake doesn't produce a lot of NBA players, which makes the fact that both Chris Paul AND John Collins are both balling out in their respective conference finals even more insane and exciting for the city of Winston.  If the Hawks beat the Bucks and we get a Suns/Hawks finals, it would be both insanely fun to watch and pretty special for my city. Maybe we could get a hype video featuring B.o.B. (Winston-born) and SAS narrating or something (he went to Winston-Salem State University). Probably not haha"
Devin Armani Booker
The only explanation for this is that Pat heard Booker saying some stuff to the bench (presumably some trash talk) and mistook him for CP3. Obviously doesn't warrant the shove but that's the only thing I can think of since Devin Booker can visibly be seen talking to the Clippers bench.
So Devin Booker is just gonna get ignored? Seems like Sarver should’ve handed the trophy to him and not Chris Paul.
Devin Booker aka Light Skin Mamba according to Chris Paul lol
And devin booker
I didn’t say he didn’t help he obviously helped but he didn’t carry them at all. Devin booker has played out of his mind this playoffs so has Ayton. Chris Paul had multiple games playing injured/ off covid where he was more of a liability than a help. His team has won multiple playoff games without him. That’s the opposite of a carry job.
I feel so justified in that knee-jerk reaction to buying a Devin Booker jersey after he carried my team in MyGM.
###DEVIN BOOKER HAS A 100% APPEARANCE RATE IN THE NBA FINALS WHEN HE MAKES IT TO THE PLAYOFFS
You know Chris Paul and devin booker both got hurt right?
chuck getting his jersey out gonna turn up at the arena with a nose mask on and say he's devin booker lmao
"Mark Jackson really just said Chris Paul bringing this team to a finals is more impressive than other teams winning championships, as if he doesn’t also have Devin booker and deandre Ayton…as well as a great supporting cast"
How can the NBA allow Devin Booker to empty stat his way to the finals???
Devin Booker probably isn’t requesting a trade this summer
"Aw, Devin Booker looked adorable there..."
Smart move by Devin Booker putting the mask back on.
Chris paul and devin booker were banged up 🤷‍♂️. History wont remember it like that anyways ☺
Devin booker at half court just talking to the fans
"I'd say Suns next, Devin Booker knows a thing or two about pushing players when he's upset"
"Actual article title btw:               &gt; Draymond Green fined $50,000 for saying Devin Booker should leave Suns           From last august"
Devin Booker stopping to chat to fans when I need him to drop 5 more pts... cmon man there's a game to play.
It only took 3 all stars getting injured for cp3 and devin booker to win
Chris Paul carrying Devin Booker right now
Devin Booker is a more valuable player and better scorer than Damien Lilliard. They may play different positions but Dame is one of the more over rated stars in the game.
"Nah but I can see him avg 18 ppg in a season with 5+ assists.  People need to realize it’s very hard to make an allstar game now, it’s not like Mo Williams era. Devin Booker and Bradley Beal miss/almost miss the all star game some seasons.   There is no way Fultz reaches THAT level. He doesn’t have such a refined offense."
"DJ was drafted five years ago (!!!) and is a month older than Devin Booker--- I'm a Spurs fan, but at some point you gotta face the music.  He can have a George Hill like career.  No shame in that.  He's also 3 years older than Ja Morant and 2 years older than Trae Young."
They started over Devin booker lol
"Devin Booker played backup to those twins. Those two aren't even in the league, Booker just averaged 28 ppg in the Finals"
I can almost guarantee he won't. That's like saying if Devin Booker averaged 50 would he be MVP?
No particular order   1. Luka Doncic  2. Zion Williamson  3. Brandon Ingram   4. Devin Booker  5. Jayson Tatum  6. LaMelo Ball  7. DeArron Fox  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   9. Jaylen Brown   10. Dejounte Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. Michael Porter  13. Deandre Ayton  14. Jamal Murray  15. Donavan Mitchell  16. Jarret Allen  17. Collin Sexton  18. Trae Young  19. Bam Adebayo  20. Ben Simmons  21. Anthony Edwards  22. John Collins  23. Myles Turner  24. Marvin Bagley   25. Lonzo Ball
"Well... I'm going to throw a curve ball out here.   Guys like Fox and KAT may be underrated, much in the way that Devin Booker has been underrated given that the Suns sucked for so long.   The thing is, most fans still think these guys are great players.  I think that, to find a player who is truly underrated, you have to go for a guy that people absolutely shit on .  So I'm going with a coin toss between Andre Drummond and Dennis Schroder.   People are absolutely shitting on those two, and the are actually solid players.   People are bemoaning Schroders poor play in this year's post season, but they ignore that, while recovering from COVID, he dropped three 20+ point games to go with those single-digit and zero-point point performances.   He isn't a bad defender. He's a solid play maker. A solid shooter when in a regular system. And he can score and create shots.   Drummond, well... he's not the defender you'd hope a center would be; however, he's one of the league's best rebounders, and for those who say ""He just grabs his own misses,"" well... if that were true, then that means that his efficiency is somewhere over 90% on field goals (he has shot an average of 11.4 FGs per game and has missed an average of and average of 5.3 while grabbing 4.7 offensive boards.   That means that he only misses 0.6 shots a game (by that logic). Of 11 shots?  That means he's scoring over 94% of the time that he's given a shot.   And there is no denying his defensive rebounding skills.   &amp;#x200B;  So if we are talking truly underrated players, I'd have to go with those two."
"KAT is currently getting the same treatment that Devin Booker and Trae Young were getting before this year. People will make excuses for why he's not a star based of the same canned complaints, but it really just comes down to lack of success. KAT's defense has been solid for like 2 years now, his problem is he plays for one of the worst managed franchises in pro sports.   I can understand liking Zion's potential better, but let's not pretend Zion isn't a huge liability on defense himself. Ayton has nice potential too, but KAT is a clear franchise star, while Ayton's been a 3rd option up to this point in his career."
"Maybe the next season? I remember that season he got some DNPs because he was angry that the Suns weren’t winning and simultaneously angry about who they were giving “his” shots to (ie: Devin Booker). Typical NBA b/s, but maybe he also then tore his acl. I’m too lazy to look it up"
Devin booker  Scoring 70 points in route to a lottery pick which lands you Ayton   Best tank commander ever
"No, I can assure you I did not forget. What I also didn't forget is that the Bucks still had two borderline all-stars on their roster whereas Atlanta did not.   And if you're asking which players were hurt in each series (which makes you sound like the forgetful one here) I am referring of course to Harden, Irving, Young, and then various injuries sustained by Chris Paul and Devin Booker which those two of course played through.   But as I clearly intimated in my comment above, I am not trying to play this game, I am trying to point out the silliness of it."
"True, but to be fair, he carried them against the Knicks and a banged up Sixers.  When the going got tough and a real team was in front of him, he showed up half the time.  2 good games (1 &amp; 3 where he lit them up) and 2 duds (30% fg, 1/14 3pt fg, 7 TOs per game, 14.5ppg in these games).  The other two he was hurt obviously so can't fault him there, but I guess the point I'm making is I'm not seeing how that single playoffs run can put him over any of these All-NBA guys or even a Devin Booker all things considered.  I guess OP was on the money when he picked a tough 5 to rank because we're not the only ones making cases for these players lol"
"Also, Devin Booker is 1/4 Mexican.  I get what you mean though. As a Filipino-American, the only Filipinos currently in the NBA are Jordan Clarkson (1/4) and now Jalen Green (1/8). Representation matters."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

Damn you’re really reaching now. Remember Devin Booker was also a “empty stats loser” up until last year. I think you’re hating a little too hard here my man
"Do you think Terrence ross is an all time great because he dropped 50 once or is he merely good? Devin booker had 2 40 pt games yes but that's not the entire series.  And to be honest chris Paul was better in that finals than devin booker. Shot better, facilitated the offence, plays defense. Also doesn't play hero ball"
Devin Booker mvp candidate is a bold one and the pelicans one is bold too
"Once they beat the Nets I was pretty sure. Could see it in the bucks reactions when they won that game 7 like they realized they were really staring at a championship. Like people wana act like it’s all up for grabs but if theres no superteams involved, when does the team with the best player not win? Devin Booker and Trae are nice but they’re not on that level"
"If you only talk about who is the best basketball player considering only the average level they have each season (regular) I would say :   5 - Devin Booker, as a scorer, he is probably the second best behind Kyrie for sure (maybe around Trae). He is also very good offball, can score on a lot of levels and can playmake for teammates at a decent level. I put him 5th cz he isn't a good defender  and a little bit too one dimensional for me.   4 - Trae Young, on the other hand, also is an extremely good scorer, relying even more on his shooting game than Booker. As a scorer, I don't consider him better than Booker but he is a far better playmaker, can lead the team in transitions or in the half court as one of the best passer in the game. Offensively, he might have the highest bbiq out of those 5 players. His defense is what prevents him from being top 3 as an individual. If you could consider how teams are built etc, he could be considered above Kat and Pg, but on the individual standpoint, he has simply a way too big gap on defense.   3 - Paul George, the best defender out there, got his place almost solely from it. He has been a consistent all defense type player the last few years, and can defend 1-3 and small 4s. He has also a complete skillset, good at handling, passing, shooting and cutting. He has also great bbiq defensively and offensively despite having awful claims, and rarely makes the wrong choice. His versality earns him this place, and if not for Kawhi injury, I definitely think the Clips would be in the final and PG would be viewed way more highly.   2 - Kat, my hot take, I simply think he has everything. Defensively, he's very average for a center, but compared to other position, his densive abilities are way more valuable. Weirdly enough, he becomes the 2nd best defender out there. Offensively, he's a monster. When he plays, he is ultra efficient, being one of the most reliable shooter in the league and being very dominant on the paint. He's also an underrated passer, though not on the same level as the other 4. In the end, he is perfectly built for the current era and if he stays healthy, I'm sure he will know more success.   1 - Kyrie, the Kai is just way too efficient. Defensively he is very average but not straight up bad and that's huge compared to the other 2 clear guards. He's a very good playmaker and an even better booker imo. Maybe has the best layup, finishing to the rim of any guard in the league and might be the most insane efficiency phenomenon in the league rn outside of Steph. Also the sweetest handles."
Devin Booker wayyyyy too low
"Tbh I was barely thinking about Steph with that comment. It obviously happens with him it happens with Lebron, Kobe, Duncan, Giannis, fucking Devin Booker. People are just too focused on what players could do in other players positions rather than what they’ve actually done"

"I'm not saying lavine is better than devin booker. Just that his stats being insane are false. His team shot markedly better than him, and he wasn't even the best player on his team that series"
"1: Paul George (turned up when Kawhi was injured. Has also led a team in Pacers and was an MVP candidate at OKC)  2: Devin Booker (made the finals with a 40 piece twice. Arguably best player on that team. No major injury issues. Has potential to be the main player on a championship team).  3: Kyrie Irving (won a chip with Bron with one of the clutchest shots of all time. However has shown poor leadership, very injury prone and locker room CANCER)  4: Trae young (showed up in the playoffs this year. One of the best scorers and playmakers, has made the playoffs, arguably can be placed over Kyrie).  5: KAT (great player who puts up good stats. Never made the playoffs though and hasn't shown the ability to elevate his team like the others on this list)."
"LeBron James - Flair  Giannis Antetokounmpo - Triple H  Devin Booker - Randy Orton   Trae Young - Dave Bautista  I wanted to fill all the positions, so I’d say Trae Young is the best upcoming PG who isn’t already a superstar (Luka) same goes for Booker being the best upcoming SG (Paul George, Kyrie aren’t upcoming). Giannis is in the beginning of his prime so I’ll say him as *top of the industry*. Then we have LeBron, the longevity legend. Someone who’s been a top 10 player for almost 20 years. He’ll definitely fill the Ric Flair role."
"I had never heard of this before, but looking at their page, they're at least well-funded and aren't a fly-by-night operation.  Some familiar names I see are Carmelo Anthony and Jay Williams on the Board of Directors, Kevin Ollie as a coach, and Avery Johnson:  https://www.overtimeelite.com/leadership   And:  &gt; ""Overtime [the parent company] recently announced it raised $80 million in Series C funding from top VC firms, industry leaders and athletes including Jeff Bezos, Drake and 25+ NBA stars including Trae Young, Devin Booker and Pau Gasol.""  But yeah, it's pretty risky for the players at this point when it's all just getting started, and they're figuring out how to operate.   But if the kid gets a decent salary plus some amount of equity and the league becomes valuable later, it possibly could turn out to be a good decision (or quite good, depending on the equity)... as long as it doesn't significantly hamper his development as a player right now.  There's also a lot more info here:  https://www.overtimeelite.com/facts"
"&gt;And as far as scoring goes, Book is more consistent  Trae Young playoff scoring by game:  32, 30, 21, 27, 36, 35, 21, 28, 25, 39, 34, 21, 48, 15, 35(got injured this game), 14(also injured).   1 non-injury sub-20 point game the entire playoffs and it was vs the NBA Champion Bucks.   Devin Booker playoff scoring by game:  34, 31, 19, 17, 30, 47, 21, 18, 28, 34, 40, 20, 15, 25, 31, 22, 27, 31, 10, 42, 40, 19.  Booker had 6 sub-20 point playoff games and at least 1 every round.  &gt;It's honestly like comparing worse versions of Kobe and Nash  Trae is on a much stronger career track than Nash."

"1. PG: efficient scorer, good playmaker, and by far the best defender of the bunch  2. Kyrie: most efficient of everyone on the list  3. Trae Young: his efficiency is similar to Booker, but Young is the best play-maker of the bunch  4. Devin Booker: of this group, he isn't the most efficient and he isn't the best play-maker and he isn't the best defender  5. KAT: same as Booker, but being a defensive liability as a center is much worse then being a defensive liability as a guard/wing"
"I mean I agree Trae is fucking terrible but these werent some offensive juggernauts targeting Devin Booker either. Aaron Gordon was going at him for parts of that series despite getting swept. Clippers just went at him every time they could and they werent doing it with Paul George in a number of cases also. Booker's on ball defense is generally mostly passable but he just does alot of smaller stuff that wont always get noticed as easily to hurt a defense that adds up.   If we're going by defensive metrics both guys defensive metrics are horrible. I dont think Booker is as bad as those defensive metrics state but there's a pretty clear gap in playmaking and Booker's frequency getting to the rim has fallen off only 10% in the postseason. That's one of the clear edges he has over Trae physicality getting to the rim and finishing, if he's not getting there as much he's mitigating that advantage."
Devin Booker hasn't taken anyone to the finals. That was Chris Paul lmao
1. Kyrie  2. Trae Young  3. Paul George  4. Devin Booker  5. KAT
- Chris Paul - Devin Booker - James Harden - Carmelo Anthony - Ben Simmons
"This is probably unpopular but... Devin booker is overrated. Wow you got 40 points in a finals game? Great, how about get more than 1 rebound and 2 assists."
Devin Booker has zero style
So were Jimmy Butler and Devin Booker. Do you think the average person knows them too?
"Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are all in the same tier as players... presuming Murray rebounds from injury."
"Here’s an unpopular opinion.... DEFENSE MATTERS. Guys who play elite defense get slaughtered for not always having elite offense but it never goes the other way around. Guys like kyrie, harden, Lillard, Trae young, Brad Beal, McCollum, old or new melo, Devin Booker etc of this class can drop all the points in the world but no one cares that they contribute negatively all the time defensively.   There is a reason these types of players don’t win. Their offense can cover up a lot of their flaws but once you narrow down the teams you’re playing to the top 8 or so they will have issues costing them on defense and not win titles unless surrounded by elite defenders. It seems like the media really can control all narratives around everyone because of the sheep mentality.   NBA executives should be focused on stealing these players away who are high level defenders as they always end up helping and can be had cheaper then they should."
"Tons of people do. Its wild when you read stuff about reggie miller and people talk about him like one of the all time great scorers, one of the most feared players in the game, just below MJ, curry version 1.0, etc.   They treat him like dame lillard when really he was khris middleton who showed up in the playoffs, or maybe a Devin booker.  Dude was a top 10 scorer 1 time in his career and wasnt a great passer or defender."
Agree with quite a few of these but. 1. Minnesota is a good sized market and what they WILL do is make Seattle and Las Vegas expansion teams and move Minnesota to the east with its actual rival cities i.e. Chicago Milwaukee Detroit 2. I keep seeing luka won’t win with Dallas takes but this feels like WAY to early like people just wanna predict the next 7 years of his career or more. 3. Devin booker is extremely talented and skilled but he has a bitch mentality which is pretty much the opposite of his idol Kobe
"&gt;Devin Booker is overrated  I complained about Booker a loooot during these finals, but tbh, that dude can ball. He hit so many difficult shots, I hated it when watching the games live, but going back and watching the Finals in full without the excitement of not knowing who would win, Booker played really well imo"
"Devin Booker with an average starting PG(say, last year's Ricky Rubio) would have undisputably made the playoffs. Chris Paul with an average starting SG would be competing for the play-in.  It's just bizzare to me how a guy who *nobody* outside of Suns fandom believed he could be the #1 option on a championship contender is still underrated, despite proving that he is."
"I’m a Hawks fan but I honest to God gave it a lot of thought, being as neutral as I could comparing the two, and I can say confidently that Trae Young is completely clear of Devin Booker, and it really isn’t even close. If you think I’m wrong I’ll happily dive into why… but I don’t wanna bother writing all that out unless someone wants to see it."
"Why you gotta do Minnesota like that 😂   I do agree about Devin Booker. He's cold but I think he and the Suns overperformed their talent level this season (which is a good thing). You have to give him props tho he had a good first playoffs.  I'll reserve my judgment about Luka and Dallas, I think it's a little too early to tell. It's not looking great tho.  Facts about New Orleans but it's sad bc it's a great city.  As a Bulls fan. Yes. Screw you. But yes."
"Ja Morant will be top 5 in 5 years  Jamal Murray won't get back to his old self  Devin Booker peaked this last season  De'Aaron Fox will ask for a trade, he'll become top 10 in 3 years"
"Middleton and Adebayo are great players, but they are way too high on this list. Why are they ahead of Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, and Donovan Mitchell?"
"Devin Booker is overrated, not by a lot but he is."
"I love the post but Idk, i like Trae Young better. I like Devin Booker better. Tatum is better all around than both and it's clear but when I see those other two in the playoffs. They put fear into your ass. Tatum doesn't. What Tatum is missing, isn't a skill or talent, he's missing that dog. That killer within him. The ability to put fear into others. I hope that rubbed off on him from KD because everything else is there to me."
"Frank Ntilikina would excel on the Spurs or jazz  Devin Booker is overrated   Chris Paul plays a lot dirtier than given credit for  Doris Burke is annoying as hell/ we don’t need to hear about the nets team and or players every game especially when they aren’t playing  Mike breen needs to save Bang! For special occasions only   Woj became annoying the second he knew he was popular just like Adam schefter  Kyrie won’t win anything without lebron  Luka won’t win a title with Dallas   Hardaway Jr is extremely overrated. Either he’s on fire or a clunker there is no in between.  Rachel Nichols isn’t all that and a bag of chimps   Mark and Gundy use the word absolutely waaaay too much  Bullock well he shoots at a good percentage people miss the fact that it usually is to start the games and then he disappears for the last 35 minutes.  Steve nash was a scapegoat hire not a white hire. If they fail they’ll just wipe their hands clean and move on.  New Orleans needs to relocate or they’re gonna lose Zion because they can’t get anyone who wants to there (even though New Orleans is a pretty chill place)  Minnesota should just move to Seattle already I’m hoping that is A rods plan. Minnesota is like Idaho and the Dakotas sure they’re states but ehhh that’s about it. Nobody really mentions them.   Jimmy butler is not a superstar and the heat are not a superteam. They’re a great team but not a superteam (with Lowry included of course)  The bulls are so overhyped on just signing lonzo, a guy who can’t create his own shot had one just one decent year so far. They’re going to be 7th or 8th seed tops."

"That's exactly what I'm saying, thanks for clarifying. I think people relegate Bynum and Brandon Roy as ""what if they didn't get injured"" but it was bound to happen, so the question is ""what if they didn't have their conditions that set them up for injuries?""  I personally think Brandon Roy would be like a current day Devin Booker and gone to the finals (imagine current DBook with the 2014 Blazers with Dame, pre-injury and prime Wes Matthews, prime Batum, prime LMA), while Bynum would fizzle out."

I think Devin Booker will make the team at some point
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Devin Booker didn't have success for ages too.  For what it's worth, Rubio was an integral part of that 8-0 bubble run."
Devin Booker is taller weighs more than the league average SG with the same wingspan. The exact opposite of small for a SG
"Lmao, Jokic doesn’t have unfair reputation defensively he is beyond awful on defence. In the bubble one of the main reasons Donovan was going off was because he was straight hunting Jokic on D, straight abused him. These playoffs Devin and Cp took turns abusing him, they ran a train on that boy. Jokic is not a good defender at all   And Devin Booker is bad at Defence, nothing unfair about it"
"Mate, they took Stanley Johnson ahead of Devin Booker, Henry Ellenson ahead of Caris LeVert and Pascal Siakam and Luke Kennard ahead of Mitchell and Adebayo.   That's three straight where they made picks that were obviously the wrong decision in a row. That's why the problem is scouting."
Feel like Devin Booker year 3 is an interesting comp. The stats are indeed empty until they aren't.
"Kobe played immaculate defense and was all around better. Devin Booker is great on offense, and he does make insane shots a lot, but not as often as Kobe."

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
This is low key throwing shade at Devin Booker. You could have directly said he scored a worthless 70 in a loss. Operation successful but the patient died.
"Bruh you can literally watch Davion defending against Cade Cunningham already. He knows how to stay connected to and disrupt shooters. We just watched Jrue Holiday shut down Devin Booker on the biggest stage. Davion's height is a disadvantage but not a disqualification. You can't not draft an elite perimeter defender because he ""might struggle against Kawhi or KD"""
"It was going downhill for him before that. Knight could put up points but he always struggled to score efficiently, had terrible tunnel vision, and turned the ball over a ton. The writing was on the wall when he went down in 2016 and a rookie Devin Booker stepped in."
Is he? We should ask Devin Booker.

Devin Booker could be next if he plays his cards right
Isn't Devin Booker in that class?
devin booker?... dlo?... u on some shit dog
"His floor is current Devin Booker, no exaggeration. He's clearly on a superstar trajectory."
"Pat Bev showed a lot more foolery the past few years. Shoving Jamal Murray in the back towards the end of an already over game. Stepping on Luka Doncic’s foot among other dangerous fouls. Yapping away at Devin Booker, Suns players and fans when he thought game was over with time left on the clock. Poetic that they ended up losing.  Pat really showed me he doesn’t have a strong tough guy mentality. More so a weak one where he’s an inferior player who can’t win legit in basketball, gets in his feelings and instead tries to hurt better players. Multiple times now instead of competing in basketball, he resorts to dirty fouls once he’s out worked and outclassed. Bitch needs to get out the league before his antics hurt any more players."
"I mean its hyperbole but I'd be disappointed if Jalen Green didn't average 27+ for at least like 5 seasons. His game is so similar to Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, and Bradley Beal. Just unreal shotmaking."
One time I sucked off the whole Suns roster in a hotel room. Devin Booker went first.
"https://twitter.com/spurs/status/1423788285898395648?s=21  Show me 5 players from this draft class that can do that, and he’s 18 with a 6’9” wingspan.  Dude should have gone higher his game is smooth, legit Devin Booker upside."
A team just made the finals led by either Chris Paul or Devin booker. That should put an end to that question
This was the year Sixers were so bad that people thought the Kentucky team featuring KAT and Devin Booker could beat the Sixers.
Devin Booker
Devin Booker better than LeBron confirmed then.
"[Draymond was fines for tampering, so there must be some rules about it](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29628273/draymond-green-gets-50000-tampering-fine-saying-devin-booker-leave-suns)"
"i think most people agree with me now but the argument still gets used on occasion... devin booker has been really, really good for a while now. there hasn't been a point in the last 4 years where he wasn't playing ""winning basketball"", it was almost entirely about the team around him."
"It's been enforced once, I believe.

And Players don't have to preserve a record of their calls, text, email, or get randomly audited.  Team execs do."
"That would’ve gotten an automatic ejection in today’s game. Meanwhile, Devin Booker can flip 5 feet away from the defender, shoot the ball 10 seconds later, then get an and-1."
"[Tell that to Draymond Green.](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/08/09/draymond-green-fined-devin-booker#:~:text=Warriors%20forward%20Draymond%20Green%20was,good%20for%20Devin%20Booker's%20career.)"
But Kobe. You know. Remember the finals? He was the reason for improvement of all the current NBA stars today especially Devin Booker and Giannis. /s
It’s pretty easy to tell that most of them are mixed and not just white though. Have you ever looked at Devin Booker and thought he’s just some white guy?
"at different times I was surprised to find out thatJason Kidd, Steph curry, Blake Griffin, Klay Thompson, and Devin Booker were black.  I guess I just never really thought about it too hard until someone pointed it out"

God I HATE Devin Booker man.
Idk man  Best young center-Joel Embiid  Best young power forward- AD Best young small forward- tatum/Ingram  Best young shooting guard-Devin Booker Best young PG- trae young  Of course luka is better then trae and there's an argument between Joel and Jokic. Giannis is pretty close with AD.
Devin Booker has the same attitude
"Most people on r/nba agreement with your assessment. That said, Devin Booker proved last season that a winning year can erase a bad reputation pretty quickly."
"I bet id be looked at as a fool if I said in 2015 that Devin Booker was gonna be an All-Star and a #1 option on a finals team around 5 years from now and is better than guys like Westbrook, Wall, ect.   This is all about prediction, it may not make sense now but in the future things can be so much different.  I dont believe in Scottie because I feel like his shooting could really not work out for him causing him to not reach star status."
"I don't think they need ""Devin Booker"" level hits, they need to find dudes like Cam Johnson to compliment Leonard and George. They had trouble with speedy guards and they got Keon Johnson. If he can defend for a good 15 minutes that's all they need."
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker should at LEAST get honorable mentions
Not Devin Booker. He leaves everything on the court.
Brown but not Book? At 24yrs old he just averaged [27/6/5](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/devin-booker-2021-playoff-stats) in the Playoffs and dropped 3 separate 40pt games in the Finals
"Honestly though. I’m so happy for you guys… you’re probably not gonna make the finals next year regardless. I hope you beat the Lakers, and Devin booker deserves everything he can get. But it’s probably not happening again for a while"
"&gt;Why do people say this? Sometimes it's ""easy to put up stats in a bad team"" and then ""easy to look good in a great team"" lmao   I was thinking about this, but both really do make sense, just not quite the same. On a bad team, it's relatively easy to put up counting stats because *somebody* has to take shots, and unless you're garbage, you're probably gonna make a decent bit of them. Enough to have a decent ppg at least. The ""Empty stats on a bad team"" trope really only applies to guys who are either inefficient or absolute trash on defense. Though admittedly people on this sub like to stretch it to any guy on a bad team who they don't like (see Devin Booker or Trae Young who both got roasted for ""empty stats"" until they made deep playoff runs).  The flip side is that, particularly for role players, it's a lot easier to thrive in a system where you're surrounded by guys who actually know what they're doing. The better spacing gives players more room to operate, even if they wouldn't otherwise be that great (see many of the role players from the 2016 Warriors, as well as a ton of other guys who have been in similar situations).  It really can be either one depending on the situation. The expressions just get misused sometimes."
Devin Booker? That's the first guard from Kentucky in that draft
Devin Booker?
That suspect's name? Devin Booker.
"you didn't need CP3  you just needed an above-average point guard, so that Devin Booker could play shooting guard where he is a more natural fit"

It’s easy to get to the finals if you’re lebron or the warriors*  By my calculations Devin Booker was neither
"Agreed, after Devin Booker retires."
Dude played in games against Magic Johnson and Devin Booker
Kobe played against Robert Parrish and Devin Booker
"Midrange game getting popular after playoffs and this is exciting. Thanks to Kawhi, Cp3, Devin Booker and Kd."
I guess he can't single handedly beat Devin Booker lol
It’s not the same. If Chris Middleton and holiday didn’t play good defense on Devin Booker and Chris Paul the   Suns would be NBA champions right now.
Devin Booker is learning that the refs in the Olympics will let him foul out.
"Conley subbed in for an injured Devin Booker, who himself was a previous sub in for an injured Anthony Davis. It's a fake all-star appearance."
Of course not!! We took Devin Booker....In a different timeline 🥲
"&gt;50 people have explained this to you. It's absolutely hilarious that you thought me making this thread would help your argument. How delusional can one person be.  I never said anything about how many redditors would agree with you. I told you to provide arguments yourself rather than asking other people. 50 people can be wrong  &gt;I also would have bet my fucking life that even after the overwhelming majority were against you that you wouldn't change your opinion. That's how people like you are. Can't even admit you are wrong about something as silly as this... I cannot imagine how you react when you're wrong about something in real life.  Changing your opinion based on people disagreeing rather than the reasons you formed the opinion is wrong.  &gt;Also using your OWN logic about heads up matches. Devin Booker &gt; Kobe. That's how awful your metric for rating these 2 is.  Booker was drafted in 2015. I compared Yao and Dwight in their primes, in an era with grinding 1v1 duels in the paint (especially when Houston was playing) so it's not really a fair comparison. You could cherry pick many of these instances, but they probably wouldn't have the significance of the two best centers in the league both in their primes facing each other in a 1v1 focused system like Houston's. My metric also isn't based purely on stats, it's based on watching the players in their primes. That's what I base my opinion on. The stats just support what I already know, which is that Yao dominated Dwight when they faced each other. I also agree with Shaq before I agree with 50 redditors when it comes to centers."
"If you dont win in the playoffs these fans dont give AF about you, no matter how good you are.   Look at Devin Booker and Trae this year, and how they were treated before."
"Ah yes, ignorance...when one of us is backed by stats and the other talks out of their ass.   Carmelo's 1.03 ppp in isolation was better than Donovan Mitchell, Lebron, Devin Booker, and Jayson Tatum. Good for 78th percentile in the league. He was getting double teamed in the playoff in isolation situations.   You dont know what you're talking about."
CP3 on setting the NBA record for choking in the playoffs - “This guy next to me will be the next one.” The guy next to him is Devin Booker.
"Yes, it is. I swear people here don't watch games. Devin Booker shot 34% from 3 in the regular season and 32% in the postseason. He had the 2nd most gravity on the Suns besides like Cam Johnson.   Gravity is about respect. Nobody's staying attached to somebody all game because numbers on a spreadsheet tell them to."
Surprisingly Devin Booker only played 5 minutes. Is he ok? Hopefully no injuries.
Devin Booker never made the playoffs in his first 5 years on the Suns. Last offseason they made the right adjustments and almost won it all. Presti is going to build a young core and then cash in on the right veteran talent/leadership.
I think expectations were too high  I am perfectly happy with his production from a 22-23 year old like he was last season. Not everyone can be Devin Booker. Would happily move Rozier to retain Malik and let him continue his steady progression.
"Honestly without Chris Paul and Devin Booker, I don’t think the suns would make the finals"
Friendly reminder that cal started Aaron fucking Harrison over Devin Booker at UK
"Devin Booker trick y'all, man. He just running around, doing nothing."
"Suggs is gonna have to the pull up shooting of Devin Booker or Bradley Beal to be a high end player in this league considering some of his existing limitations in finishing. I was actually hoping we take Suggs if we project his jumper to develop into that level. But if he really was bombing empty gym catch and shoot drills then I guess I’m fine with the Raptors not taking a chance on him.   Barnes on the other hand just have to be competent enough shooting the three to attract some close outs, considering what you know he can do with his size, passing, and defense. That player is still not number one option but can be a major piece on a great team if we get another first option.   It comes down to I can see justifiably passing on Suggs if you think he tops off at just an okay jumper."
1. KD  2. Devin Booker  3. Blake Griffin
Devin Booker.
"Best case scenario he’s a Devin Booker Donovan Mitchell caliber player. Worst case scenario he’s out of the league by the end of his rookie deal.   Great prospect but IMO he’s the definition of boom or bust. If he booms he’s going to be a star, if he busts it’s going to be very ugly."
Devin Booker averaged 28/3/7 against Kobe and Kobe only averaged 17/3/2 against Booker.  Booker also won EVERY game he played against Kobe.  Booker &gt; Kobe confirmed.
"Young empty stats players is one of the dumbest classifications out there imo  There was a time Devin Booker and Trae Young were ""empty stats"" guys"
Thom maker vs devin booker
They were reportedly choosing between Stanley and Devin Booker also(who wanted to go to Det).
"Better than Devin Booker on similar volume last year (5.5 3pa, ~36%)"
"Dlo Devin Booker Cam Payne KAT and Myles Turner, I dig it"
Do people realize guys like Jrue and Devin Booker shot like 31% from 3 on like 6 attempts a game these playoffs?     Literally have never seen a Booker or Jrue is a bad shooter post. Both were career losers prior to this season too. So overblown.
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
Donovan Mitchell? Devin Booker? Kyrie?
"There's only 3 players younger than Devin Booker in the current Phoenix roster. DeAndre Ayton and the two 2020 rookies. Yet, Book is the ""oldest"" Sun. It always surprise me how long he's been in the league for his age."
On 2K I always picked the young teams with potential but for some reason they start to get boring when they get good. I started with the OG OKC Trio and then went to the Phoenix Suns with Devin Booker but for last two or three seasons it's the Pelicans for me.  (I guess I'll be an OKC Fan again soon with all those picks they got lol)
"The ones that become great players are the exceptions. The odds are that most of these picks will never amount to more than role players. Yes, picks like Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell have proven to defy this, but the overwhelming majority don't. Y'all only really remember the hits, but a lot of the busts go forgotten. Either way, I don't agree with wasting a potential top 15 player of all times late prime trying to rebuild"
Devin Booker
Is it better than Landry Shamet?  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Jimmy Butler * Ben Simmons * Joel Embiid * Kevin Durant * Kyrie Irving * James Harden * Devin Booker * Deandre Ayton * Most likely CP3
Devin Booker went to Brawadis's home
"Only similar case to Primo I can think would be Devin Booker at UK. Came off the bench, averaged just two points more than Primo and got drafted at 13th. In both cases Kentucky and Bama were highly talented teams and as such had plenty of other talent to score. I’m betting the Spurs are hoping that Primo pans out similar to Booker"
Chris Paul and Devin Booker scored on him? Say it ain't so
"Holy shit thank you for holding onto this treasure. Devin Booker? Outta the league. Luka? Role player. Oh but big Charles Bassey, that mf'er is top 10 easy."
He is the same age as devin booker that’s insane
"I don’t know. I only know *why* he was picked, not how well he will do. For every Devin Booker or Giannis, you get a Dragan Bender. And the jury’s still out on Poku."
The Suns are still haggling over whether to include Ayton or just Devin Booker.
DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE DEVIN BOOKER AND KENDALL JENNER RUMORS WHEN HE WAS DATING HER AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
"&gt; 2015: KAT &lt; Mario Hezonja, Devin Booker, Tyus Jones  debatable?"
"Sixers are gonna crash and burn on this. Colin Sexton , Kevin love, and a pick or 2 is more than enough compensation. The real rub here is it is very possible Sexton will end up being a BETTER player than Ben Simmons. People are so caught up on the idea of ‘points on a bad team’ guys that they don’t realize if you put actual players around a guy like that, he’s not gonna turn into a pumpkin, he’s gonna be just as good and so will your team. See Devin Booker, Trae young, and Zach Levine (almost). The Sixers have all the defense in the world so if you add Sexton to Philly he can. Just do him.   He also becomes dare I say an AI-like beloved player. People who aren’t familiar with him need to get familiar he has ‘it’ factor and would immediately be loved by fans. Sixers are stupid"
"More like heavily-used, clearance rack 10% of the orignal price Devin Booker"
All that to beat Devin Booker?
Discount Devin Booker and Devin Booker on the same team
"Shamet has played for four different teams in his first four years.  He has played with Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Devin Booker, and possibly Chris Paul."
You got dogged in the first round by Devin Booker:///
"Back before I went bald, I had curly hair and looked like Devin Booker. I still kinda look like him in the face but he's def much more handsome than me lol"
Duarte is the same age as Devin Booker.
Devin Booker scored 47 on 90% TS to eliminate y’all in the first round after being a 7 seed all year. And you wanna talk finals this year lmaooooo
"There isn't a single country in the entire tournament who is communist wtf. I am rooting for the US because I am a Suns fan, and they are the team with Devin Booker."

BREAKING: rumors suggest Devin Booker wants to be traded to the Lakers
"Devin Booker was 17th in free throw attempts per game, not including less free throws per game than AD this year and way less free throws per game for his career than Lebron.   38 points on 15-22 shooting to eliminate the Lakers without a single point from free throws, didn’t need them to beat y’all."
Is Brandon Ingram hounding Chris Paul and Devin Booker over screens? No bro. Jrue was definitely the best player on the Pelicans. 100%. He’s not gonna get in the young guys way. And he guarded the best guards in the world so he had some dead legs…. But no way
"That team needs to be a top 3 seed for that guy to win MVP. In the East, I think most people agree that unless some serious injuries to occur the Bucks, 76ers or the Nets are going to be the top 3 seeds. The only real wildcard is the 76ers with Ben Simmons trade possibilities and Joel Embiid injury history. So, there’s one potential spot open, and the most likely team is the Hawks sneaking in. So, Trae Young can be that dark horse MVP in the East.  In the West it’s more interesting and the most likely dark horse MVP is coming from there. I think there are a couple of candidates like Devin Booker who could get a lot of serious consideration if the Suns finish as the Nr. 1 team; Paul George if the Clippers end as a top 3 seed without Kawhi.  And there are the “Are they really a dark horse if everyone knows them?” In Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard. I think if the Lakers finish as a top 3 seed and we see Anthony Davis putting monster numbers without LeBron and carrying the team you could see a lot of buzz for MVP. Damian Lillard if he stays with the Blazers and they are a top 3 seed you could see a lot narrative in his favour for staying with the Blazers, being loyal and deserving MVP for guiding his team from the 6th seed to the 3rd seed in the Wild Wild West."
ESPN: Does Devin Booker hate America? More after the break.

Was wondering the same thing. You can check out this [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=devin+booker&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk003Ru6N0x74q45JD4yGcVOQn2_FgQ:1627481714787&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=qdr:d&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSsPPr-YXyAhXNHM0KHSkfCGcQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=629#imgrc=JrCzFSdGLaCeQM) which has many images of Booker from last night.   [Here's one of them](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2021/07/28071906/GettyImages-1234254868-1024x683.jpg)
ESPN: Devin Booker stated that it was nothing personal between him and them. Did Lebron took it personal from the loss from the playoffs? Will Lebron bounce back next season? What will be Lebron's next step?
"So because Devin Booker might not win a ring, it isn't worth taking a player who's similar to him with a top 3 pick regardless of how good this about-to-be-drafted player actually is?"
"You could say something similar for CP3 and Devin Booker and the Suns, who have never won a championship despite having such hopes during the barkley and nash days. We love the suns in phoenix but have gotten no love for a long time."
I’m absolutely shocked that Devin “8 Fouls” Booker would try to commit a foul. He’d probably argue for a jump ball too.
Because obviously Devin Booker hasn’t seen or prepared for a double team since that video came out years ago
HE VICIOUSLY ASSAULTED DEVIN BOOKER
Devin Booker has accumulated about 16 fouls in his last two games.
"""Guys guys guys am I the only person who thinks Giannis is a wholesome little cupcake and Devin Booker is satan's (AKA CHRIS PAUL) little buddy?"""
"I mean he’s old and isn’t in his prime anymore. Devin Booker and Ayton just started having breakthrough years while Giannis, Middleton, and Holiday are in their prime."
"I get it’s “Hate Devin Booker” time on r/NBA, but this post is so stupid. Dude was the [most double-teamed player on pick and rolls in the league](https://twitter.com/SoaringDwnSouth/status/1164275467970580486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1164275467970580486%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-23454290093907520855.ampproject.net%2F2107030008001%2Fframe.html) two seasons ago, but apparently that old pick up ball clip means he’s never practiced them? Why can’t we just say that Jrue made a great defensive play, which is what happened?"
"Wait, are we back to “Devin Booker only puts up empty stats cuz his team loses” timeline?"
Can’t grab the rebound even with Devin Booker jumping the 3pt line before the shooter has even released the ball. He was literally &lt; 3ft away from Middleton when he released the ball on his final free throw. That shit pisses me off more than Giannis taking forever.   https://youtube.com/watch?v=AwquWb7wfFY&amp;f?t=03m38s  ~3:40 if the link doesn’t go directly to the free throw.
"Yeah I dislike all 3 of those guys because they're also constantly whining to the refs even though Devin Booker especially got away with some of his fouls, very important ones too."
I agree dude. KD could never have beat Chris Paul and Devin Booker without 3 other Allstars. He’s such a fraud right?
I like Devin Booker.  Everything else about the Suns feels off
Don't tell that to the Devin Booker haters right now....
"&gt; he will need to seriously improve in a new area to approach those guys' level.  He's been doing this, just no-one sees it because we're trained to see him as run-and-dunk man. He's one of the best passing power forwards in the league, and in an elite category of passing big men. These playoffs he's been hitting from 10-16 on the same % as Chris Paul. From 3-10 he's been better than Devin 'The Next Kobe' Booker. Can't even start on the rules he's breaking for what we expect someone 6'11 to be able to do defensively."
Just look at how much more Devin Booker whines to the refs now that CP3 is on his team
Devin Book the Refs Booker
"Ah.  You mean like when Devin Booker got a fast break off of a steal, and Giannis literally tried to tackle him in mid air, including directly hitting his face with his hand, but of course that didn't get called because they managed to just call some other nonsense on PJ Tucker to avoid having to give Giannis an obvious flagrant.  &amp;#x200B;  Weird how you failed to mention that(or any of the other literal dozen fouls that Giannis commits every single game) but managed to point out one thing that CP3 did."
"Devin ""PatBev"" Booker"
"This doesn't absolve CP3 but Giannis did literally the same thing to Devin Booker earlier in the game (pushed him in midair, similarly D Book only didn't land awkwardly because he hung on the rim). So if that play was dirty, so is Giannis...?"
Nah what’s ironic is posting a clip titled Devin booker fouls Middleton and no foul is called right after a video of Jeue Holiday steals the ball from Devin booker and hits a three. Y’all need to take off those tinted glasses you’re wearing it’s embarrassing
"Why are we assuming Phoenix just ‘stopped’ moving the ball? Could it also be that Milwaukee denied the passing lanes well and basically said fuck it let Devin Booker try and beat us with his hero ball.   Let’s admit it, Booker has always been a great scorer but it never really resulted to much success until the bubble."
"Chris Paul is a dirty player, but to be fair, Giannis did the exact same thing almost to Devin Booker earlier in the game on the booker fast break dunk. Book was lucky he had the rim to grab otherwise he would have gone flying."
"it was so annoying when mark jackson was like ‘they gotta get devin booker the ball and apply the pressure’ after they finally start playing like the finals TEAM that they are and Mikal Bridges hit a couple big shots. the rest of the team shot 73% from three for fucks sake, maybe the focus shouldve been on finding the open jumper and not devin booker heroball mid range isos"
"This is dangerously close to the “Giannis at his best doesn’t make the Bucks better” take, so I’ll say it for the Suns fans who don’t want to deal with this: Booker scoring 40 was nowhere near the list of issues for the Suns last night. In fact, the entire offense wasn’t an issue, they played fine there. Defense, transition, rebounding sure. Devin Booker doing too much offensively? Nope, not at all."
"Almost like a missed 6th foul for Devin Booker that should have taken him out of the game.  🤔  Crazy, eh?"
Giannis literally did the same thing to Devin Booker earlier… he was just trying to save a bucket
devin booker gets locked up and averages 0 points
"Giannis literally did the exact same thing to Devin Booker earlier in the game.  I get that it was a dangerous play, but it's also something that happens from time to time."
"The Bucks were due for this game. Makes game 4 where we lost by Turnovers in the most Un-Suns-like way possible hurt even more.   We can still win this series. I don't expect us to do so. We have traded punches with the Bucks but a bit of incredible play and luck meant they kept responding better than us. Can't ask much more of this great team. They will be back next year. Booker and Ayton shut a lot of people up. This has been an incredible season.  Glad for Giannis. Wave that Greek flag high. Lot of NBA players don't like him cause he's not part of the club. Fuck 'em. ""Giannis has no bag"" losers deserve a Giannis 30-10-5 FMVP.  Devin Armani Booker will retire as the greatest Phoenix Sun and it will be an honor to have watched all his career.   P.S. Bud and Monty have both coached a very good series. Bud is very proactive with throwing different looks defensively and Monty while making 1-2 big blunders mostly in game 3 has done a good job running sets that expose the Bucks did it a lot with the double drags that fueled our comeback last night. Suns went down playing Suns basketball...for 2 out of 4 quarters."
Yep. Love Devin Booker but I will always root against CP3.  Wish Rondo had punched him harder.
Needing a soft ass foul for Devin Booker is the most Suns thing ever. So fucking soft 😂
At first I wanted the Suns to win but then I realized how whiny Devin Booker is and how much Crowder flops. Plus Giannis in a small market is kinda dope.

"Devin booker only getting his ass rimmed by Kendall Jenner if he wins a chip  Pour guy gave it his all, you could tell he tried to hard carry.  He wanted it badddddd, but his asshole will remain dry as the Sahara desert."
"Giannis could’ve seriously injured Devin Booker on that after the whistle dunk, he’s lucky he landed on his feet. Wait r/nba hates the suns right now so that’s gonna get ignored."
"Honestly I don't know how any neutral fans could like the Suns over the Bucks.  The main players for the Bucks don't flop, they don't really embellish contact, they play defense.  The only big downside is Giannis takes 15 minutes per game to take free throws.  They don't even hunt free throws often, if they get a guy in the air they actually try to score it unlike Booker who does the classic NBA fling yourself into the defender ""omg he fouled me!!""  Chris Paul and Devin Booker flop like crazy, Devin Booker whines to the refs constantly and can't play defense without fouling and it only gets called half the time.  Also Chris Paul is obviously dirty af"
If Devin Booker makes a good defensive play you can pretty much assume he fouled
"Fuck Devin Booker, whiny ass bitch. How does that clown not get called for anything"
And yet I would still take all of those players over Devin Booker.
Devin Booker isnt Kobe
"I mean you obviously need to live with those, even expect that those will go in, he’s a very good player. That’s not even something they can really control, just like the bucks can’t control devin booker hitting all those other hard ass shots"
"You're really going to sit here and complain about a guy not getting a technical for bitching about foul calls..... with Devin Booker and Chris Paul on your team, also not getting technicals  for the dozens of times they've cried to the refs????  Jesus Christ.  Get some self-awareness, bud."
Yes. Look at your 4th picture. His entire left hand is inverted inwards — so his palm is against Booker’s inside wrist… he is not grabbing the ball — unless he’s trying to grab the ball with the back of his hand? Plus his fingers are curled over his wrist…  You’re correct he’s pulling his arms (which have control over Devin’s wrist) towards the ball which is towards his body and away from Devin Booker.  You can honestly see through the time stamps just from the stills (let alone actually watch the video) how much Devin is tugged forward from a planted base.  You stopped at 4 seconds but you’ll see at second 5 he literally let’s go of his wrist. You see separation that shows his hand was facing inwards at Booker’s wrist.
There is zero evidence that this Finals being played a month later has had a major effect on ratings. This is pure narrative; people don’t wanna watch because people don’t care about Devin Booker as much as they do Curry
"No, you just don't like Devin Booker. If Ayton ripped it out of Giannis' hands like that, it would be a different story."
Chris Paul looks like a snail hiding in a shell. Devin booker is at least keeping them in games
"Well, taking out Devin Booker in the 2nd quarter for those minutes wasn't a good idea when he was hot. That's a coaching fuck up. Allowed Bucks to close the gap."
If they lose the series then no not really. Jrue got the ball handed to him by a panicked dumbass devin booker and made a very basic fast break play with one of the worlds top athletes who is 7 foot tall against a ghost defense. In the moment live it was so fucking sick and the timing was badass. But it wasn’t an all time highlight. If they win yes it will mean way more. If it was game 7 of course. But really devin booker choked so hard. Then basketball happened. Calm down. And they called a foul….almost embarrassing.
Did Giannis not do the same to Devin Booker earlier in the game?
"I’m not a bucks fan, I’m a Celtics fan who dislikes devin Booker. And the bucks still beat a healthy Miami team and got past the hawks without divencenzo and giannis for some games.  Your franchises only ring is a result of injuries. Is that why your so adamant that injuries don’t matter?"
You’re misinterpreting ESPN goons as Devin Booker fans.
Devin “8 Fouls” Booker
"right? you think history is going to be kind to jrue fucking holiday taking over this game? no shit if multiple top 100 players and a couple top 20 all time were playing in the same finals, and it was going this way, people would be all over it. You cant compare khris middleton to james harden or devin booker to even kyrie"
Devin Booker &gt; James Harden
"Unlikeable why, though?   A group of young talent making a pretty good run through a tough Western Conference?   Is it because Devin Booker works the refs? I guess everyone here can't stand Tom Brady, either."
"Devin Booker the only player in the NBA finals history, playing with more than 6 fouls every game."
yea but i added up all the numbers on my calculator app and they say devin booker stinks
"BOOKER HURTS HIS TEAM. HE IS A VERY SELFISH PLAYER. ALSO, I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A CRYBABY. IF THE REF LOOKS AT HIM FUNNY DEVIN STARTS TO PLEAD HIS CASE. WHAT A JOKE."
"idk why you're getting downvoted. This is a push-off through and through, regardless if Devin Booker did this 10 times before it is still a push-off"
The fact Devin Booker had the ball stolen is an extra bonus.
Coping with Devin Booker doing something only 6 other players in NBA history has done? Pretty easy to cope with tbh
"You, their mom, Devin Booker, and everyone in this thread, you’re all bitches. Hell, I’m a bitch too. We’re all bitches."
That shouldn’t be a foul. Don’t they know that’s Devin Booker?
"Lol yes, Devin Booker ending game 6 against the Lakers in the first quarter, putting up 47 on 90% TS in a closeout game... had no impact"
NBA is really trying to make seem like Devin Booker is a superstar with all these fouls not called on him
" If either Booker or Ayton end up in foul trouble, Suns lose.  Otherwise they have a decent chance.  It depends on whether late fouls actually get called on Devin Booker."
Yup not like he cries any time he doesn’t get a call. Not like he started complaining about a no call right after the refs allowed him to go past the foul limit last game. Not like he didn’t get tossed out of a game for shoving the hell out of Schroeder while he was in the air during game 3 vs the Lakers just because they lost the game and Shroeder was going for a shot instead of dribbling it out. Devin Booker is a bitch and people are allowed to call him that just like you think you’re allowed to call Pat Bev a bitch.

Devin Booker and CP3 are no longer friends    - espn
"&gt; But also the worst defender in the suns starting lineup is Devin Booker so I’ll put that on him too  Lmao, there's no way you watched this game and say this with a straight face. It was Paul who was being hunted on defense whenever he was on the floor. If you want to use stats, Booker was a +12"
"If anyone seems to be incapable of getting called for fouls it's Devin Booker, not Giannis. He had 8 fouls in Game 4 then gets away with [this blatant foul tonight.](https://streamable.com/2bzz2l) I don't know what Suns fans have to complain about."
Yeah I agree. But also the worst defender in the suns starting lineup is Devin Booker so I’ll put that on him too
Fuck Devin Booker Fuck Chris Paul Fuck the Refs who were trying to hand them the game Fuck Lebum James and his shitty movie Fuck Cam Johnson and his floppin ass shit Fuck the dude counting money Fuck Jae Crowder for thinking he’s the third splash brother     BUCKS IN 6
"Yeah, fair enough. Certainly I can agree that the reason the Suns lost tonight is not Devin Booker, and in fact he’s the primary reason it was kept close"
"chris paul and devin booker, you two combined are not giannis. you suck!"
Devin Booker has zero career points that don’t involve shoving people with his forearm.
FUCK DEVIN BOOKER
Devin Booker Is A Fucking Bitch
"&gt;Devin how devastated are you for Chris?  What kind of shitty ass question was that? Whichever reporter asked that shouldn't be allowed to ask another question this Finals.   Booker made a good call saying ""next question."""
Devin Booker Is A Bitch
Devin Booker will mug him and get no charges
Fuck Devin Booker
Devin booker is also 24 in his first playoff run.
"Chris Paul is the key factor in all of it, if he plays like he has for the past 3 games, forget it, Bucks are winning in 6. If he decides to play decently next game then yeah there’s a chance to force a Game 7 but in reality, no one is helping Devin Booker, he’s trying to keep the Suns alive yet no one wants to step up and help him so i highly believe with home court advantage, we’ll have our NBA Champs on Tuesday"
"Lol if he passed the ball and they lost you’d be saying booker should’ve taken the ball himself and score, devin booker should absolutely get the final shot and he made the right decision trying to do it himself, it just didn’t workout for him 🤷🏽‍♂️"
Fuck. Devin. Booker.
Devin booker the only player in nba history with 40+ points and 7 fouls in consecutive finals games
devin booker learned a tough lesson about why you never want to show jrue the ball  cause he's gonna take it
"Devin booker dropping bombs all finals bar like 1 bad game, I'll take home that trophy 🏆 yall be safe out there ✌️"
Devin booker gets the majority of his mid range shots from pushing off
At least he can say he got mugged the same night as devin booker.
That’s what happens when devin booker meets good defense
Fuck Devin Booker
"CP3 could've ended Giannis career in that last ally-oop, he pushed him when he was at his highest, but luckily, he was stronger.  Devin booker has been balling all alone despite that turn over at the end, CP3 has been disappointing.  Giannis has been himself, but what made the Bucks win, is Jrue, he put a defense and an offensive clinic out there."
FUCK DEVIN BOOKER
Can I get a fuck Devin Booker?
"Devin Booker, the king of empty stats."
[devin booker every possession] (https://youtu.be/1vCVvJF6Jbw)
"He's absolutely a star, he just isn't a superstar. He's in that Jaylen Brown/Devin Booker/Rudy Gobert/Khris Middleton/Donovan Mitchell"
Devin Booker
They should trade him to the suns for peanuts so Devin Booker can bring Kendall to practice everyday.
"Sorry the lyrics were too deep for you. I'd recommend you listen to Gucci Gang, a famous diss track critical of Devin Armani Booker."
"So you're saying Devin Booker is the rule and not the outlier?  He also got Chris Paul on his team, which you know is a star player.   And no I didn't watch the finals. Once the sixers were out I had no reason to watch it.  If Sac thinks its gonna go get a star player of that level and that's what puts them into the playoff conversation then go for it.  But don't tell me that Fox is sooo good that he's untradable."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Even if defense wasn't the most important in the league back then ( which it was), it indisputably was on that team, they were consistently a great offensive team prior to drafting bill, what set them over the top and made them THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DYNASTY IN THE HISTORY OF THE NBA was bill russells leadership and incredible defense. Even today, what sets kawhi Leonard apart from someone like Devin Booker or Trae, who both averaged more points per game than him, it's the elite defense.  To call bill Russell, a 12x all star 5x MVP 11x champion 11x all NBAer 1 time all defense first team (the last and worst season of his career being the first year this award was even being given), and 4x rebounding champ just another Ben Wallace is completely insane. He probably would've had even more awards had the even existed while he played, I mean the dn fmvp is named after him."
"I have a lot of comments on different threads that get downvoted or get mixed results. Here are some:  Chris Paul is not a top 10 PG all-time  True PG’s as your number one or even two will never win you a championship (Magic and Isiah are not true PGs fight me on that one)   If TMac, CWebb, Reggie Miller got in the HoF, so should DRose.   The Knicks are still a basketball purgatory because they have been trash since 2000. Save for the 2013, 2014 and 2021 seasons.   Devin Booker is the most overrated player today because of the comparisons to Kobe.   AI’s legacy is mostly predicated on his off-court contribution. If you look at his on-court stuff, he is not a Mt. Rushmore SG. DWade and Jerry West get the nod over him."
"disagree. middleton isn't the most consistent scorer, but devin booker has back to back nights of 37 points then 12 points. he'll shoot 4/7 from three than 1/8. and there is no metric to quanitfy ""aggressiveness"""
"Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Damian Lillard. Everyone loves to overate flashy guards. I’ll say though that as soon as any of them get in a shooting slump, they very quickly become underrated. Small players are inconsistent at times. When they get hot, everyone hops on their D and says they are the next steph. A couple bad shooting nights and they are overrated chuckers."
what aspect of basketball is devin booker better at than khris middleton? serious question
what aspect of basketball is devin booker better at than khris middleton? serious question
I wouldn't necessarily pick him first but Devin Booker is one I could see doing it that I haven't seen mentioned yet.
https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2021/06/21/lakers-news-stephen-a-smith-says-devin-booker-is-the-next-kobe-bryant/
"I defnitely think some people overrate him with the Kobe comparisons but [Book averaged 27/6/5 over 22 games in the Playoffs this year](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/2021-devin-booker-finals-stats). Pretty awesome for a 24-year old. For reference, in Kobe's 2002 Playoffs when he was 24 [he averaged almost the exact same stats](https://www.landofbasketball.com/stats_by_team/2001_2002_lakers_pl.htm): 26/6/5"
"&gt; My hatred is mostly stemmed from just having it in my face all the time  Believe me, I can totally understand that. I think everyone can. It's like a song you dislike becoming a huge hit that is played over and over everywhere and so you grow to absolutely loathe it.   The unfortunate thing about what has happened with LeBron (and others like him) is that the people that hate him intensely drive the endless conversations about him as much as his hardcore fans do. It's because at this point nearly everyone is invested in him, even if it's for opposite reasons.   The true opposite of love is indifference, not hate. [People who hate LeBron want to see negative stories about him,](https://youtu.be/9G6xu-J_Dmc?t=5s) just like people who like him want to see positive stories about him. The reason why he gets talked about so much is because everyone feels strongly about him, one way or another, and that's gold to people looking for ratings.   ESPN knows that whatever they're saying about LeBron, people will care, so they keep talking about him. If they switch and start talking about like Devin Booker instead, some people will care, but others will be like ""I don't really care about this guy"" (or worse, ""who is this guy?"") and will be more likely to tune out. If you really want all the talk about LeBron to go away, the best thing you can do is just ignore it. Downvote the threads about him and never even look at the comments. If ESPN starts talking about him, change the channel or turn it off. Giving him attention, even negative attention, is what fuels all the talk about him."
"Devin Booker. Before anyone gets fucking salty, let me state that overrated does not mean they’re bad.   With that said, Booker has been dubbed the next Kobe but the only thing they have in common is their tough shot making in the mid-range area. People act like he had this giant leap when in reality he’s been the same player since he scored 70. The only difference now is he has Chris Paul. Good efficiency and great scorer but nowhere near Kobe."
"Devin Booker  You’d think he’s a superstar if you read the comments, but he still has many flaws and is a top 20 player at best. For example I’d take Middleton or Mitchell over him"
Did you just say what does Klay do that covington doesn't?? Lol wow. Klay's game is closer to Devin Booker than Covington lol.
"I think the Suns are in for a real come back to earth moment.  THey were basically the only health team in the west last year while all their peers had terrible injuries and no one they beat in the playoffs was close to healthy.  Chris Paul is going to be 37.  I don't think Devin Booker is best player on a top west team material.    Just a guess, could totally be wrong.  But that's what I think is gonna happen"
Finally watching Devin booker play on a team with a sustainable winning style of ball really opened my eyes as to how good he is.
"Phoenix Suns: pg chris paul sg devin booker sf mikal bridges pf crowder  c ayton  bench: payne, shamet, cam johnson, jalen smith, mcgee (if we trade for thaddeus young then insert him at pf)"
I never thought Devin Booker was the truth. Glad to know he just needed a legit team around him.
"Cool. Mamba mentality says that superstars should warrant it, Kevin Durant (superstar) says it’s lame shit. Both Kobe and Gilbert are understanding that mamba mentality is going against the conventional etiquette of an open gym run, that they want doubles. Gilbert was also a ball hog and that notoriously limited his game, he didn’t want doubles to pass out of them and make the right play. But even then, you’re telling me y’all are giving a pass to Noah, DLo, and those guys for having to double a 22 year old, 0 time all star DBook in an open gym? The thing that Gilbert and Kobe recognized to be doubled was to be recognized as a superstar, and they should want that. DBook wasn’t at that level, and even then KD still thinks it’s lame.   You don’t double in open gym unless there’s a clear understanding that one player is above the rest. Booker chose to play against NBA level guys in an open gym so that the playing field was level enough that he wouldn’t have people doubling him in a pick up game. It’s lame that those guys couldn’t hold a 22 year old Devin Booker, he’s in the same league as them and was a 0 time all star. If you can’t guard him, pick someone else who does a better job."
What about KD every long skinny wing player gets compared to KD. And also if you’re light skin and can shoot your gettin the Klay or Devin Booker comparison
"PG: Chris Paul  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Mikal Bridges   PF: Cam Johnson  C: Deandre Ayton  Bench 5: Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, Abdel Nader, Javale McGee, Landry Shamat"

"&gt; Dame exclusively guards other PGs.  Thank you, I’ve not had a good laugh yet today.  In the three games Blazers played the Suns this year, Dame’s defensive assignments were as follows: * Mikal Bridges 17:28 * Chris Paul 3:46 * Devin Booker 3:04 * Jae Crowder 3:02 * Cam Payne 2:09  All of them played in all three games btw.  &gt; They’re both at least always guarding and being guarded by other guards.

"Not a hater, but I thought Devin Booker was just a “good stats on a bad team” player. But a year or two ago, when he started handling PG duties really changed my mind."

He is not a basketball god just because he lost in the finals. Guys much greater players than Devin Booker have been criticized so can he.
Ok Devin booker
"  I was building 🔨 my dream home 🏡 when sadly 😞 I ran out of 🧱 bricks, Suddenly I see Devin booker  walking 🚶‍♀️ down the street! All I had to do was tell him the game 🏀 was on the line and he threw up enough bricks 🧱 for me to complete my ENTIRE HOUSE! 🏡Thanks dbook , you finally came up clutch!"
"Melo easily, this wasn’t even a conversation in their prime, cause it was so obviously Melo.  There is so much revisionist history since PP won a championship as a 2nd option on a super team. It would be like if 10 years from now people are saying Khris Middleton is better than Devin Booker, because he is a better defender and passer and won a ring with Giannis lol."
"""If Devin Booker wins a championship this year I'm putting him over LeBron."""
PLAYERS:     A) Devin Booker   B) Anthony Edwards (2nd half of the year)   C) Donovan Mitchell    B) Collin Sexton
"Yes, just because Devin Booker made the NBA Finals last year while beating injured team after injured team, he must have all the right answers on how to practice and be better.  I mean, why even criticize someone, let's just assume that because he is an NBA player he must be correct in everything that relates to basketball. This is the same Devin Booker that hadn't won more than 35 games before Chris Paul arrived in Phoenix, he must be right."
Devin Booker scoring a buzzer beater on Dennis Schroder and then on insta’s ESPN highlight commenting “That’s Tuff 🔥💯” shit was hilarious 🤣
"&gt;maybe the best dunk contest ever with Lavine and Gordon  I'm pretty sure the entire ASW was one of the best if not the best ever as well. The 3 point contest was star-studded with Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, JJ Redick (who was lead the league in 3P% that year at 47.5%), Klay Thompson, CJ McCollum and Stephen Curry. It went down to the wire between Steph and Klay- with Klay taking it all by saving his all-moneyball rack for last. The skills challenge was also one of the better ones in memory as it was the first time a big won it (KAT beating IT in the final round)"
"OG and Hunter are not “definitely” better defenders than him, that’s an absurd r/NBA take.   OG is marginally better than him sure, but saying Hunter is “definitely” better is legit laughable. Hunter is NOT better than Mikal, in fact I think he’s clearly worse at this point. Mikal is one of the most disruptive defenders in the entire NBA, Mikal’s arm are every bit as long as Hunter’s, and is a much quicker and active defender. Mikal is by far the best perimeter defender on a team that was top 10 in the regular season on defense and was 2nd going into the Finals (finished 4th).   Devin Booker and Chris Paul are essentially on the same level on defense at this point, by the wcf and the finals CP3 was getting hunted more than Booker was on defense. I believe Ayton is one of the best post defenders in the league, but Capela is up there as well.   Looking at the lineups, Atlanta has every bit the defenders Phoenix does… so why were the Suns considerably better on defense both in the regular season and playoffs than the Hawks? Mikal. So again, it’s laughable to say Hunter is “definitely” better than Mikal"
"Devin Booker keeping his whining muscle strong in the off-season, gotta respect that preparation"
https://youtu.be/yjVfRkoqOqU devin booker isn’t god.
Devin Booker definitely a hipster wannabe
Hey guys I wonder why Devin Booker is saying this
"Yeah, because I don't feel like arguing, but my point stands. Booker didn't get double-teamed on that play; he dribbled into a trap. Re-watch the game if you want. Bucks didn't double Booker all game and he just ran into two guys with Jrue behind him. It was a boneheaded play.  Besides, [here's a thread from two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ct6v9o/devin_booker_saw_the_most_double_teams_off_pick/) detailing how well Devin Booker handles double-teams. I get that /r/NBA wants to beat this joke into the ground, but good God, man."
Devin Booker would have a box Chevy pulled by 10 IG models
"He is **not** good looking. Why you think Devin Booker, Ricky Rubio or JJ Reddick are so lusted after? I have seen broke ass dudes with hot women. Know why? They are good looking. I remember some women at work roasting some athletes and saying 'I don't care how rich he is ......."
"Well I didn’t say he made any of his 3s! Nonetheless, watching him live was pretty cool!  This was also the same game when Devin Booker got injured in 2019. I saw him fall out of the corner of my eye. I was sitting on the other side of the court as it happened.  That was also the night that the Suns became my second favorite team in the NBA."
"It’s definitely passer. Take away the insane on time reads from any angle, and you have a bigger stronger devin booker. Still an amazing scorer, but when u add that to his passing game, it comes back to help his scoring game too"
"It's the covid bump players. Trae Young, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton all got a pretty good reputation boost for being available when most of their peers were sick or hurt, but I think the biggest boosts went to **Jokic** and **Randle**.  Julius Randle is an elite player like Jokic is an MVP-- which is to say that his name is only coming up if 75% of the guys above him are hurt, sick, or both. They were prolific in the Covid-addled mess of 2020-2021, and so they got the attention. Now Jokic is pencilled in as an MVP candidate and Randle as an all-NBA level player going forward. Jokic is GREAT and Randle is GOOD, but we all know MVP and all-NBA, respectively, is NOT who those guys are."
"He had that crazy run and everyone immediately jumped to thinking he was Devin Booker when it’s more likely he’s a more complete version of Lou Williams.  He’s still super young though so we really don’t know. If he turned into a 25ppg guy I wouldn’t be surprised. As a heat fan, I don’t expect it, though."
"yep, defensive perception rises and falls with narrative. When a shit defensive player gets offensive accolades or has a great offensive season, suddenly people say, actually he's much better on defense than people think. See: Harden, James; Irving, Kyrie; Lavine, Zachary; Booker, Devin; Westbrook Russell; Jokic, Nikola, etc etc. Not all of those guys are equally bad, but what they have in common is their were suddenly considered improved defenders after monster offensive seasons. Do we really believe that's true? C'mon."
"As far as DFG%, the major concern is that a player doesn't defend enough for volume to be adequate (which Booker does) or that a player simply doesn't defend anyone/takes plays off which do not negatively impact their DFG (which Booker doesn't any more).  Honestly, I've not put much thought into the LEBRON stats -- of which you are right that they have him notched as pretty bad still. However, it also is showing Ayton (the only other player I looked up) as a below-average defender which I can very much assure is confidently wrong.  However, as far as RAPTOR goes, it does continue to support my statement that he's average now. In 2021, among all Shooting Guards (96 eligible based on RAPTOR's default 1058 MP), Devin Booker ranks #51. That puts him 3 spots below the 50% marker, which would support that he is now an average defender."
"I like him and will probably get roasted/downvoted for this, but Devin Booker is just so inconsistent. Like dominate one game, missing the next."
I agree with this completely. It goes both ways too though - a player gets labeled as a bad defender by somebody and it’s a tough label to shed even if they’re actually pretty good. Like Jaylen Brown - he’s got his issues off ball and he’s not perfect but overall he’s a good solid defender - yet I’ve started hearing people say “Jaylen Brown is an awful defender”.   Total aside - people actually say Devin Booker is a good defender?  My god he’s so bad and it was just on full display for the world to see in the Finals and the Olympics.
Devin Booker only has good D when he's with Kendall
"Phoenix Suns fans 1000000% the worst offenders. Devin Booker is not a good defender and he is not the best player on the team, Chris Paul is."
devin booker should have proved empty stats don’t mean anything this season
Devin Booker
"Do u really think devin booker and zach lavine weigh more than him, also it just doesnt align with what we know about tatum's past"
Devin booker . He’s got game but his attitude needs to change
"I’m ready to be murdered for this but Devin Booker. Don’t get me wrong he’s an amazing young talent, but his defense is atrocious and he can be inconsistent for long stretches. I think we tend to rate people based on what they CAN do, not what they DO do."
PJ Tucken ~~LeBorn~~ ~~AD~~ Devin Booker Stopper
"Very good points, plus college super teams with Kentucky and Duke getting the best the 1 and done players. So glad those programs did nothing this year. Some rather be 7th man on Kentucky then be the star on another team. Like Devin Booker, my only memory of him at Kentucky is clapping on the bench.  If the trend doesn’t reverse in 10 years the NBA might just be 4 Globetrotter teams and 26 Washington Generals"
Yeah how do people not remember? In game 4 Booker had 42 and Chris had 10 lol. That was the series right there. Then in the next game Chris took forever before he did anything. Devin had another 40 then as well
"I'm taking your argument to be that he's not a good playmaker because he has low assist numbers and his teammates are not making shots?  But it's not like he's being given Klay Thompson or Kyle Korver and making them shoot 35% from 3. Minnesota has had legitimately bad shooters throughout KAT's time on the roster. Just because someone is a constant doesn't mean they're the problem, is my point. See: Devin Booker."
"4th-8th seed. I expect them to take round 1 to 7, but either lose or get destroyed in round 2. I’ve lost a lot of faith in these guys.  DLo would’ve been better off in GSW with the market exposure.   I know more stars is usually good, but KAT finally got his dream co-star in over 2 years ago, and even in spite of some team setbacks, there’s been little to no pulse of success.   I am not confident that a gun-shy BS, a complacent KAT, and DLo being a poor man’s Devin Booker will be that good. Ant is the only clear bright spot on this team, maybe he has to be the face of the team."
Devin Booker? He should have just said Mike James was better than Steph. No one will take it anymore seriously.
"Yes, I would like either Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell."
Devin Booker is not gonna like this one
Lol booker was one of the best isolation defenders on Middleton and jrue and Schroeder averaged 14 on 40%? I’m not sure if we were watching the same games  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/arizonasports.com/story/2721392/lets-give-nod-devin-bookers-defense-during-suns-playoff-run/amp/
"But Donovan Mitchell lost to the same clippers team that Devin booker beat? lol. Also, Mitchell’s defense was a huge reason why they ALSO blew that 2-0 lead. Dude couldn’t guard a guy standing in the corner. It was actually sad. He scored buckets but man was he getting toyed with on the other end."
"Light skinned 5'11 Van vleet is loved. 6'3 jamal murray is loved. 6'5 light skinned Devin Booker who also grew up well off is loved. Klay Thompson who also grew up rich is loved.   As far as his size is concerned he is league average ""at worst"" for his size. Chris Paul is 6'0. Just stop"
"Devin Booker is two inches taller, are you serious right now? You're pathetic bro lol  Edit: Jamal Murray is loved and is the same height as Curry. Seriously, grow up"
They have to get Devin Booker to Minnesota and [recreate this commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMjpG89_kKY)
We have the data: Donovan Mitchell edged out Devin Booker. Now you don't have to apologize for listing Don as 1% better than Booker.
That Devin Booker is the second coming of Kobe. Media really tried shoving that down everyone's throat and the Devin Booker/Suns stans doing the mental gymnastics to prove that he indeed was.
"Absolutely - his mid-range game is GOAT status. It adds to the sheer audacity of his accomplishments that he wasn't a volume 3 point shooter and he did most of his damage in the mid-range. Guys like Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard etc. are keeping this lost art alive."
"To be honest, Devin Booker has been averaging those numbers and better for awhile, yet he's never been selected for the all star game. He's only gotten in due to injuries."
"My guesses were:  * KD * Giannis (I thought maybe against the Pistons or something) * Anthony Davis * Donovan Mitchell * John Wall * Devin Booker * Andre Iguodala  I was certain of #5 and #6 and I guessed #7 was going to be either from the Warriors or Cavaliers, because he was never going to be one of the stars and for a role player, bad FT shooter to shoot at least 20 free throws he would need a lot of games."
"D'lo, KAT, Simmons, and Devin Booker are the new age Banana Boat crew. Except they just stream video games instead of save each other from drowning."
"*The young socialite, banished from Florence under false charges, set for the snowy Alps to begin his quest for vengeance. His lover turned her back on him for a finocchio by the name of Devin Booker, but he vows to gain her back yet...*"
6 is Devin booker
"Right... but which players rise to the top if you look at relative to averages like that? For example, against the Celtics Michael Jordan averages 30.7, but that's only .6 above his 30.1 career average. Devin Booker on the other hand averages 28.1 which is 5.1 above his 23 career average. I didn't confirm that that's the highest, but that's what I'm wondering about and for each team."
"I've always been a Booker fan, these playoffs did nothing but confirm that he can be the best player on a championship contender (I see him as better than CP3 because first   * think of the team without Chris Paul (just inside the playoffs because they were 9th last year and got major upgrade in coaching) * think of the team without Devin Booker (basically no scoring, I respect Paul and Ayton but they aren't primary scorers on a playoff team)  So I've always seen Booker as the best guy on this team and I know that's a hot take because everyone says it was all Chris Paul but people are forgetting about the bubble??? I think the drastic increase in wins was mainly due to DeAndre Ayton's improvement and Booker's maturity. Paul was a minor factor. Sure he was a good player but Booker is better. Draymond could be considered the leader of the Warriors, the glue guy, and is obviously not the best player. Although he is a completely different Chris has a similar role in terms of leadership. Go ahead and put me on some delusional takes thread if you want."
Devin Booker sees two defenders  *whistle*
Devin Booker can be hot headed at times
"I agree, jaylen brown is better than Devin booker and it’s not even close"
"Here's why its important to mention though. There's lots of stars in this league who don't have much impact when they shoot poorly like this. Most of the elites do, but impact on an off  night is what separates a Steph Curry from a Paul George and a Paul George from a Devin Booker.   However, this is not exclusive to Steph. The top tier is all able to impact the game on off nights, though perhaps not as consistently as Steph (who then also happens to be more prone to these games in the playoffs because of size and way he's reffed)"
"C'mon, did you really hit me with the vague accusation of an informal fallacy that, even if true, doesn't structurally damage my actual argument? Because I made my own positive argument, I didn't just respond to yours.  Also, claiming that it is possible to ""strawman"" an argument one of whose points was *literally* just the word 'defense' is, I think, a bit dubious.  And again, saying ""someone of his skillset is not valuable"" is just demonstrably false, considering that making the playoffs *is itself valuable* for NBA teams, and LeVert has helped to do that twice. It's also a bit dismissive considering the archetype of ""mediocre defense, good shot creation and playmaking"" is what Devin Booker is and his team was in the finals. Different levels, but the same archetype you're dismissing. The value, alternately, of the archetype ""passable defense, offensive negative despite being high usage player who is not yet but may become better"" I'm skeptical of. Don't give RJ his laurels until he actually gets there (which I think he will, it's just clear he hasn't yet)."
"I’m a Suns fan. The absence of Jamal Murray is equivalent to the Suns without Devin Booker, so his injury was the biggest factor. Not sure what the outcome would have been if both teams were fully healthy but it definitely would not have been a sweep. Deandre Ayton didn’t outplay Jokic, but he contested him enough to prevent that from being a weakness for Denver to exploit and he held his own sufficiently. MPJ didn’t shoot well the entire series, I remember there being some speculation regarding his back and I can’t remember if he was playing through a back injury or not, but he’s still young and has a high ceiling with a ton of room to grow. And Phoenix was 100% healthy that series. CP3’s shoulder was back to 100% after injuring it in game 1 of the Lakers series and nobody was injured. That series was when the Suns kinda peaked during the playoffs and it was against a banged up team missing their second best player."
"It’s a consensus ranking because most fans are casual and just see ooh he scored 50 in the finals with by far the most stacked roster when accounting for injuries in the playoffs against probably the weakest finals team in 20 years led by a 36 year old Chris Paul whose only defender big enough for Giannis was like 19 and looked terrified to be on the court.   It’s just regency bias, if KDs foot was one inch smaller everyone would be clowning Giannis, if devin booker went off for 50 people would be calling him better than harden. Even though that would change nothing about how good they are.   It’s been clear since harden got left off any all nba team in 2017, which if you look back is just laughable, when Westbrook won mvp over harden when harden was better at literally every aspect of basketball except he averaged 9 rebounds instead of 10 spoonfed rebounds a game. When Giannis won mvp over harden when harden was averaging 36 ppg on crazy efficiency (something we won’t see for a long time) and dragging a worse roster to a high seed in the west. That people are just biased against harden and will overlook all of Giannis’s flaws because he seems nice.   Harden has been better than Giannis for years and he’s better than him now, but Giannis makes videos at chic fil a, so he’s on par with KD(ludicrous). Even Giannis doesn’t believe he’s on par with KD."
"Right, so just as I said, ""defense"", ""shooting"", etc., - are arbitrary terms that are more intended to be unrefutable than to actually make a positive argument.  RJ Barrett is a better defender, but LeVert's lead over Barrett offensively is significantly higher than Barrett's lead defensively. Barrett has little ability to playmake or create his own shot, where LeVert does. RJ Barrett was assisted on 52% of his shots, LeVert was only assisted on 42%.  Which leads directly to shooting. The fact that they have the same true shooting (so I'm not sure why you're calling Barrett a better shooter to begin with) is not great for Barrett considering the degree of difficulty on assisted shots is much lower, so he should make more of them than LeVert makes off his own creation - but he doesn't, outside of spot-up threes, which LeVert doesn't really take.  As for playing in a system, Caris LeVert was the leading scorer on *two* playoff teams, whereas Barrett scored 14 points on 38% shooting and 28% from three in his playoff system debut. Regardless, ""playing in a system"" is more contingent on having a coach with a good system than anything to do with the players. Kevin Garnett never played in a good system the whole time he was on the Wolves, but they never had a functional system, so we don't hold it against him.  As for potential, that's just not really relevant. Evan Mobley has more ""room to grow"" than say Bam Adebayo right now because Bam is approaching his prime and Mobley isn't. That doesn't mean you give Mobley some prima facie credit for improvements he hasn't yet made.  All in all, to believe Barrett is better, you have to have a reason why ""defense"" and ""spot up shooting"" are sufficiently more important categories for a shooting guard than shot creation and playmaking, which are generally the go-to skills at that position. After all, in all the categories you value, Barrett is better than Devin Booker (better defender, higher 3pt%). But I'm skeptical you would use that to argue Barrett&gt;Booker."
"Aayton yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Devin Booker gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Mikal Bridges yelled out, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before CP3 hit the locker room door, former NBA player and assistant coach Willie Green hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
The Devin Booker/KAT Kentucky team? They’d have no chance lmao
"Lavine has the Devin Booker syndrome, where nephews say ""bUt CaN hE dO iT iN ThE pLaYoFfS?"" Of course he can but his team has been bad and he doesn't play the best defense either. Betting on the narrative to shift quickly this year"
"Maybe not, but he can lock up the opposing teams best guard in a way that Rondo even in his prime couldn't manage. Clippers didn't need another playmaker/ball handler like the Lakers did. We needed a stout defender who could hit 3's.   (all following quotes come from this Sports Illustrated article - https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/how-patrick-beverley-silenced-doubters)  &gt; Pat Bev answered the call. In the 45 possessions that Beverley guarded Mitchell in the playoffs, Spida scored just 10 points on 23% from the field, turned the ball over 4 times, and was blocked 5 times. In the 72 minutes that Mitchell and Beverley shared the court, the Clippers were a +29.  &gt; Coming into the WCF, Devin Booker was averaging nearly 30 PPG in the previous two rounds. His dominance helped Phoenix eliminate the defending champs in the opening round, and sweep the MVP in round two  &gt; After Booker put up a 40-point triple double in game one of the WCF, Ty Lue inserted Patrick Beverley into the starting lineup for the remainder of the series. While the Clippers were unable to overcome the loss of Kawhi Leonard, Ivica Zubac, and Serge Ibaka, Pat Bev had Booker locked up. In the 110 possessions that Pat Bev guarded Booker, D-Book shot just 28% from the field, turned the ball over 7 times, and did not make a single three-point basket.  So, again, currently they are pretty even they just have different skillsets"
"Eh not really. Were sad our players could put up a better fight even with injuries for sure, but as is the game.   Rings come in a matter of time.   I was rooting for you guys to get your ~~2nd~~ 1st championship. What with all your comparisons of Devin Booker to Kobe Bryant I expected nothing less."
"Chris Paul averaged 9/4/8 on 44% TS, and yet y’all still lost both games 5 and 6 in the first quarter to Devin Booker skullfucking your defense, tough"
"Your talking about the regular season where they placed 15th and then 10th in the standings right? Because he had no playoff stats to compare to without CP, similarly with Devin Booker who’s been in the league half a decade without making the playoffs once. Trying to claim he was more productive cause he averaged 4 less points in a season half of the size makes you sound fucking stupid."
Devin booker and Mikal bridges both get 3 inches and are not 6’9” and 6’10”. Unstoppable scorer and incredible wing defender.
just like devin booker when he first signed his max contract
And the suns are a good team and have devin booker so it’s not like getting luka would make them any better.
"I keep addressing this, but these points are all comments I’ve seen in-person and on-Reddit multiple times.  Yes, knowledgeable basketball fans don’t think Kobe was inefficient. But not everyone is well-versed in career TS% or refuses to acknowledge it. Hell, we’re in 2021, and no one uses TS% on TV as an efficiency metric. Kobe being inefficient is still a commonly-held opinion on Reddit. Just yesterday, someone called Kobe inefficient (he said it in absolute terms, not relative to someone else) and he got upvoted several times. I can find the comment and link it if you’d like.  As for the other myths, there are multiple people on THIS THREAD alone who called Kobe a ball-hog and a chucker. Literally just look at what DeanBlandino said: “I find it strange to pretend he wasn’t a ball hog or a chucker.” There was another dude that also said something along the like. I cant believe you’re trying to insist these myths aren’t commonly-held opinions. Is it the majority? Probably not, I haven’t polled NBA viewers. But there’s several opinions on here that are narratives surrounding Bryant which still float around to this day.   As for his playoff performances, I’ve seen multiple people on Twitter bag on Kobe and bring up stats like “Oh, Devin Booker has more 40 PT games in the Finals than Kobe” (which is a fun fact) or things along those lines. Just yesterday, someone brought up Kobe’s career Finals FG% to try and argue he was a poor Finals performer who simply got carried. I can also show you that comment if you want me to go back and dig for it.  It seems like you keep trying to downplay the premise of my post by saying no one believes in these arguments, yet I run into these type of people every day - including on this thread.   Even if you reject the notion that these are commonly-held opinions of Bryant (which I wouldn’t understand), that shouldn’t detract from the meat of my post: the actual facts and statistics."

If you knew anything you wouldn't say he's just a 14ppg 11rpg player... Swap Devin Booker with Ben Simmons these past 3 years and Ayton would have a higher usage ÷ with more ppg. Embiid would put up way less numbers because Booker is a top scorer and so his usage ÷ would go down. Simmons is a top passer and Ayton would have been taking a lot more shots a game without Booker on the team. Location matters.   It's a lot deeper than just looking at his career averages. Maybe watch a game sometimes
Sources: Devin Booker is beside himself. Driving around downtown Phoenix begging (thru texts) Ayton’s family for address to Deandre’s home.
"Kind of hilarious how the dude has already played with:   Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and now Chris Paul and Devin Booker."
"This is so hilarious. Your only argument is hypotheticals - ignoring that in this run the Suns were also injured lol Chris Paul was injured the first game of the Lakers series, got COVID, and tore ligaments in his hand which he needed surgery on. Devin Booker had his nose broken. Saric tore his ACL lol. Further, you're somehow criticizing the Suns for beating the Clippers, which the Jazz failed to do. The Bucks needed seven to beat the Nets WITHOUT Harden and Kyrie. Do you see how dumb this sounds?  I am not expecting a return trip to the finals, but implying they don't have an extremely good shot is just either ignorance or stupidity."
"Did Woj really include ""The emergence of Devin Booker"" in the  list of Aytons ""sacrifices""?"
"Just to clarify, when you say he turned things around, do you mean since devin booker? Cuz that was like 3 years ago and he's owned the suns for almost 20. Sorry, my dad lives in arizona and suns are as close to a 2nd team as I'll have, Sarver SUCKS"
"He could win a chip as a first option but it would take incredible amount of luck to do so, just as devin booker and the suns had this year. Even then you could argue chris paul was the first option that playoff run because of his leadership and facilitating. Dame’s playstyle just fits better as a second option. Someone who is clutch and can take over when the first option cant hit any shots (like khris middleton but alot better)"
"Dame is more than good enough to be the first option.  Hell we just saw Devin booker up 2-0 in the finals as the #1 option.   He just needs another superstar with him, barring some crazy super stacked team.   But there's not many guys that would be the first option over Dame. He's a top 5 scorer in the league. Harden, KD, Curry, and maybe Giannis are the only guys that are better  ...and those guys are all obviously able to be the #1 option"
"What everything Ayton does, Bam does better except rebound. He’s better offensively and on the defensive end, not to mention having Bam feed Devin booker would be ridiculous, Booker would get way better shots."
"I feel like it's underrated how much pressure young players are under in modern sports. Rookie QBs supposed to be the savior of the franchise the moment they walk in the door. Lottery picks are expected to come in and score 20ppg off the bat or they're a bust. Or guys like Devin Booker, AD, or Kevin Love who are thrust into the first really meaningful games of their careers and are immediately expected to be centerpieces of championship teams."

Imagine Bam with Chris Paul and Devin Booker making space for him
He was sitting just like Devin Booker had to.
A little bit ago I had to defend my comment that devin booker is better than Zach Lavine and it became a heated debate so yeah
Brandon Roy I think could have gotten very close to top 15. Devin booker is a lot like Brandon Roy was
"Devin Booker MVP - Suns take No. 1 overall seed as Paul takes a step back, while Booker takes a step up. He finally becomes the 3-pt shooter he should be capable of being, and wins it on a 31/6/6 line and 48/39/88 shooting."
"Re: the recent Draft --  This year's draft will likely go down as one full of moderate hits, one or two grand slams, and big misses. The moderate hits will be Cade and Green, each of whom will likely be all stars at some point. Neither will have the massive impact of a genuine superstar, however, like Kawhi or Jokic etc. Sengun and Giddey are both more promising superstars than Green and Cade because while they have lower floors, they both also have higher ceilings. Sengun is likely to have a high percentile outcome and Giddey's home run outcomes are considerably better than Cade or Green's 75th percentile outcomes.  Barnes was likely the best draft pick after Mobley and has as good odds of being the best player of the group in 5-6 years as anyone in the draft. Mitchell tops out as a good starter and Kuminga was a high risk pick. That said, Barnes' defense is overrated and his shooting was underrated.  Non-draft related hot takes:  Volume scorers with small builds aren't worth building a franchise around outside of rare exceptions (e.g. Curry), so Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, etc. are all low or mid-tier all stars and likely always will be. The Bulls will not make the conference finals without significant help from injuries and if they do make it there, they won't get more than 1 win."
"Kevin Garnett played against Magic Johnson and Robert Parish, but also Devin Booker and D’Angelo Russell"
he is basically the same age as Devin Booker
Sitting in the corner while you got dudes like Chris Paul and Devin Booker taking all the offensive pressure away from you is obviously gonna lead to him having higher efficiency. OG has always been an elite 3 and D player but you can clearly see he’s added to his bag this summer. I don’t see Bridges pulling step back 3s (I’ll admit tho I haven’t watched his preseason performance so maybe I’m wrong)
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Deandre Ayton  4. Mikal Bridges  5. Jae Crowder  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Abdel Nader.
"Devin booker and the Point God are ""The Bible"""
"It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.  Ayton is a good player but not a great one. Same thing is true for Devin Booker and late 30""s Chris Paul. If the Suns let any of those guys walk for nothing it would be devastating, but at the same time it's almost impossible to build a contender in 2023 if you're paying $100M to three guys who aren't All-NBA caliber."
Trae and Devin Booker are two that come to mind for me.
"Harden, AD, Devin booker/CP3, PG, maybe Jamaal Murray when healthy, and that's just the west."
"Top 5 Now Steph Curry, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Trae Young.  In 5 Years that’s tough, but I say. Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Cade Cunningham."
"Who is the player everyone knows that everyone agrees is overrated, by the way? Like who are you supposed to say to get upvotes here? Pascal Siakam? Tyler Herro? Ben Simmons? Devin Booker? Domantas Sabonis? Jayson Tatum?"
"They play nothing alike but most likely Devin Booker/Lavine/beal level *impact*, less volume scoring and more passing"

Devin Booker definitely is not in that group with those others
"In the 17-13 range imo. I think he's just below or on the:   PG13, Devin Booker, Tatum, Jimmy Butler, tier of guys."
"&gt; If Chris Paul is injured, would you still say this?  It took literally a top 3 playoff series performance of all time for the Suns to lose.  Giannis has never consistently made FT's or mid range jumpers and fadeaways like he did that series.  If it isn't for the dude playing as well as anyone has ever played in a playoff series, Suns win.   Why do people act like the Suns lost to some scrub or something?  lol  But to answer your question, yes.  Devin Booker led the league in points created per touch, for like the 3rd or 4th time in 5 years.  They have snipers at every position other than Ayton.  Cam Payne is a very good backup PG, and we added Shamet."
Devin Booker is not Top 15? Come on bruh
Kareem did scoring and elevating his teams better than wilt. He was the first post scorer to lead his team to an elite offence. In today's era even with his game wilt would be accused as an empty stats guy like devin booker.  And you can't have wilt ahead of bill that's just straight smoking crack. And KD ahead of steph come on now.
"Welp, Devin Booker is still very good at basketball."
"This entire situation starts with one key misunderstanding.   If the sixers succeeded trading Ben Simmons for James harden, they would have fucked him over. It is a straight knife to the back to make a player sign a max and then trade him. The entire fucking point of the max contract is so players cannot leave and they cannot be easily traded. Look at the players that got fucked over   Derozan, Blake griffin, Chris Paul (to a lesser extent). The biggest offence a team can commit against a star player is to make them sign the max then trade them.   Imagine if this happens to anyone else; gainnis? Klay? Siakam? Bam?    You are all hypocrites, you cry that players don’t sign the rookie extension but don’t see it as treachery when the players are just being pumped to be traded.   Player empowerment this and that but you forget that this tanks the value of the rookie extension even more.  You don’t want super teams but you are setting the rookie extension up as a bad deal.   Why stay with idiots that got lucky with ping pong balls when you can build a team with players that fit your play style. Player built super teams have always been more successful than team built super teams.   This Ben Simmons situation sends a clear message, fuck the rookie extension, the teams aren’t loyal.    Because for all this noise Ben could have been playing on the same team with trea young, or devin booker, or steph curry. We are here because he was loyal, until they weren’t, then he wasn’t."
Devin Booker - Family Channel
"Siakam actually had a pretty good year last year.  Just don't look at his buzzer beater attempts, although he was still more clutch than Devin Booker, Jimmy Butler, Ingram, or VanVleet, AND at least he attempts the clutch shot, unlike some ""super stars"" out there.   Also, without Siakam, no Championship either, so a lot of that contract was probably a reward."
"most stars have some type of mid range post game. changes in officiating and player archetypes have made it harder to run the classic- clear out one side, get position, entry pass type post play but you see it more in flow and hybrid moements a la kawhi and devin booker and KD and most of the leagues elite scorers"
Devin Booker and Chris Paul still use the midrange jumper heavily
Where did SAS pull that Harden info out of? Probably the same place where Kuzma was being traded for Devin Booker.
"I was high on Klay and Devin Booker during their college careers and was super happy to see how they panned out. However, I was also super high on Austin Rivers before his draft. Not a complete bust, but definitely nowhere near as good as I thought he would be. My worst was definitely believing that Kendall Marshall was the next Rondo.   Also, no one will probably believe me, but I used to hype up Jeremy Lin all the time before Linsanity lmao. I remember leaving a comment on an old YouTube highlight video of John Wall and Jeremy Lin playing each other in Summer League. Claimed he had what it took to be a solid starting point guard in the league. Can’t find that comment anymore. But it was an incredible feeling when Linsanity happened."
Right. Because Chris Paul and Devin Booker aren’t good enough to win a final. 🙄
Devin Booker is not going to be that good and Jaylen Brown will never be a top 10 player in the league
everything about Devin Booker over the last 6 years. I got a whole list of Book comments that are down voted to hell that all ended up being correct. The most recent ones being right during the 1st round of the playoffs last year.
I truly believe that Adam Silver recognized that Mike Conley has been deserving of an all star bid throughout his career and realized that he was getting older and might never have an opportunity to make the game and saw the perfect opportunity to put him in the game when Devin Booker got hurt
If you wanna bring up the Devin Booker less suns PG couldn’t beat Joe Ingles with Westbrook in a game that actually matters
Devin Booker still in quarantine? I remember reading he had COVID but haven’t heard if he had symptoms/ was feeling better
Luka Doncic  Devin Booker   Mikal Bridges   Jae Crowder  Clint Capela
and Tim Hardaway Jr becomes Devin Booker lol
You get Luka playmaking + 3-level scoring and Devin fucking Booker then decide to get Clint? Shitttttt
1 Chris Paul 2 Devin booker 3 Mj 4 james harden 5 lebron james
Donovan Booker or Devin Mitchell but it’s close
"I don't see Booker being a good or great defender. It's just completely different.  Butler came into the league as a random kid and Thibs made him guard the best player. He had those defensive tendencies early and although Devin is relatively young it's hard when you have such an offensive load.  Kobe is an outlier, no one will ever be as passionate and determined to be that fucking great. He wanted that challenge and embraced it, completely chaotic and psychotic.   Players like Demar, Harden, Beal are great offensive stars which I would put similar to Booker. All their respective team relied on them to score because they were the first option.  Sure there are guys two-way players like Klay, PG, Jrue but it's so taxing chasing people around screens and playing defense in today's NBA. CP3 was the best thing that happened to Book's career so there's some balance now but if you don't learn and embrace defense early it's really fucking hard to develop it later."
"0. Steph Curry  1. Luka Doncic  2. Steve Nash  3. Klay Thompson  4. Ray Allen  Honorable Mentions: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, Kobe Bryant"
he is one playoff run away from garnering the same level of respect devin booker has this past season.
"If you’re team has to bench you at the end of a playoff game because you literally refuse to shoot the ball you’re not a top 25 nba player.   This list is not in an exact order, it’s just players who are better than Simmons.   Ben Simmons sucks  1. Lebron  2. Curry  3. Giannins  4. Kd  5. Jokic 6. Ad 7. Kawhi  8. Westbrook  9. Lilliard 10.

Zach lavine 25. Pascal siakam"
"As a Lavine stan, this feels high.   There’s so many talented dudes in the NBA. Like, how do you rank him against Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jaylen Brown, etc? Cause those are guys all outside of the top 15 who play a similar position to Zach."

Devin Booker seemed so far away
The only problem I have with raptors fans is that some of them overhype the players to an extreme. After the championship I had arguments with multiple people who tried to say that FVV is better than Devin Booker
Jayson Tatum &gt; Devin Booker
Khris Middleton &gt; Devin Booker
"Throwback to the infamous Blake Griffin [he ain’t even stretch doe](https://youtu.be/NCFd-e6ggbE) which features young D’Angelo Russell, Devin Booker, and Bobby Portis"
Devin Booker is vaccinated he’s just doing that dumbass annoying thing that a lot of other players are doing in not holding unvaccinated players accountable and not calling them out.
Do your own research means getting confirmation on your own dipshit takes from other dipshits.  Kyrie: “I think vaccines do not work  Devin Booker: “I also think vaccines do not work”  Kyrie: “I fucking knew it”
Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. I just feel like their impact isn't as great as their stats would suggest. I feel like their teams would do better if they got others involved more. Booker with his role players and DMitch with Gobert specifically.
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"Right, which explains why he lost to Devin Booker   Meanwhile KD was a toe away from eliminating the current champs, with his second best scoring option shooting sub 30% from 3"
Devin Booker in front of the Kobe Memorial is enough to make a grown man cry
I’m just saying their is no way prime Lebron misses the playoffs or gets knocked out in the first round by Devin Booker.  He’s clearly a different player
A 24 year old being called a glorified scorer? Devin Booker has entered the chat.
"Kyle Lowry-Devin Booker-Robert Covington-Ben Simmons-Porzingis  3 high level defenders, 4 willing and able shooters around Simmons, rim protection with KP and Covington, and 2 playoff tested shot creators to make up for Simmons lack of skill in that area. Also 2 elite level passers and a very good one in Booker   It really depends a lot on if you think KP can get to a better defensive level than he’s show in Dallas though, you could swap him for Myles Turner but you’re losing some of the shooting upside"
"I think they can do a lot better, even in that scenario, than trading for 2 years of Vucevic, coby white, and a Portland non-lottery first, which is the only pick the Bulls can trade because all their first rounders after 2022 are subject to being traded.   Coby does nothing for them, they don't need him with Cam Johnson, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Cameron Payne on the team already. His role will be very small. Vuc is in no way valuable enough to make that trade work."
Answer: Who is Devin Booker?
"ESPN: Monty Willams doesn't understand inflation, shows how dumb he is. Should Devin Booker request a trade to the Lakers?"""
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
Ok I see so he pulled off the Devin Booker.  He was 17 in the NCAA and 18 in his NBA debut which is pretty remarkable.
Devin Booker but a deeper voice
"Yes, but what about unrealistic expectations. Devin Booker, but sexier?"
"&gt;Who is the best **shooting guard** in the NBA?  &gt;1. James Harden, Brooklyn – 63% 2. Devin Booker, Phoenix – 17% 3. Luka Doncic, Dallas – 10% &gt; Also receiving votes: Bradley Beal, Washington; Stephen Curry, Golden State; **Kevin Durant, Brooklyn**  Um, excuse me? KD hasn't played at the 2 since Seattle..."
"He was 16th in FTA per game, higher than lebron. Higher than devin booker, higher than Kawhi, higher than Donovan Mitchell. Stop with the bullshit that he doesn’t get superstar calls."
Chris Paul/Devin Booker in shambles
"man fuck Devin Booker, hated him since he was at Kentucky"
Devin Booker 26/5/4 on 49/37/89 splits
"If you seriously think just because he placed top 5 in mvp voting that means hes a top 5 most valuable player in the league you are on the moon. The MVP has and always will be an award that narrative heavily influences. I can name you more than ten players that are more valuable than 2021 Chris Paul. Lebron, Jokic, Embiid, Davis, Giannis, Kawhi, Durant, Harden, Curry, Luka, Tatum, Trae, Mitchell, hell even his own damn teammate Devin Booker has an argument for being more valuable to his own team than him. Chris Paul adds veteran leadership, high iq basketball, and an all time great facilitator but I have no clue why suns fans act like he's still some otherworldly top 10 talent."
"Nah the consensus was for Devin Booker. Hell, Jimmy Butler and Bam were bigger snubs than Derozan.  And yeah, I'd take Lonzo over Derozan if I could only have had 1 join the Bulls"
"There's no argument for Devin Booker over Kyrie except being a hater.   Even Beal, who just has raw scoring numbers over Kyrie, is not a better player than Kyrie.  The hate for Kyrie's decision making in real life may be justified but not for his ability. He's better than these guys."
Cam Johnson is older than Devin Booker
"Chris Duarte, who got drafted this year to the pacers, is the same age as Devin Booker."
"If they chose the best possible player with the best fit at every pick every year? Probably a lineup of  Ben Simmons  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  With guys like Mikal Bridges, Dejountae Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Thomas Bryant, Robert Williams off the bench."
And then got bounced by devin booker 💀 try again
"And it ended up being predictive of how the narrative would change  Devin Booker for example  19/20 the Suns had a positive net rating when he was on the court but a bad one when he wasn't, he got blamed for ""empty stats"" just like KAT is now  Then suddenly he gets help and his reputation improves"
"I hate Herro and didn’t see the Devin Booker comparisons previously, but holy shit that kid can score. Looks like he grew taller too, I swear."
Devin Booker
Trade Ant for Devin Booker. The 3 friends can play together and boost morale.
I feel like Ants going to go through what Devin Booker went through. Putting up crazy numbers on a losing team until he was surrounded by the right pieces and the right coach to turn the franchise around.
Devin Booker is already a top 12ish player and probably will end this season top 10
I don’t even see the confusion lavine is a better basketball player than Devin Booker
"Chris Paul are the reason Devin Booker in the finals. Remove Paul, Booker would be in the trashcan again"
"Everyone's a loser who can't get it done, until they're not. This time last year, Devin Booker hadn't played a playoff game. He won 24 games or fewer his first four years. Now he's one of the best players on the defending western conference champs. His #1 pick teammate kept developing, and the team added a couple of good veteran pieces, and he looked totally different. Give Ant time to keep improving, and if the rest of the roster improves, KAT could look totally different too."
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
Khris Middleton is better than Devin Booker? Idk if that’s such a hot take I’ll still stand by it today
Zach Lavine for Devin Booker
Devin Booker backed up when he watched that video
"Seems highly unlikely. Don't you think CP3 (who's had Sterling), James Jones, Devin Booker and Monty won't show solidarity if DA was sitting out because of the allegations? I think if Suns player(s) and/or staff take action, it will be as a group."
"Maybe Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker?  Assuming age isn't a criteria."
"Mikal Bridges, Chris Paul, Devin Booker."
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

"People tell me DBook can’t take that next step because he doesn’t defend, pass, or rebound. I must not be watching the same Devin Booker as them, because he’s does all of those very well.  Cam Payne is a top 5 backup pg in the league and it’s not some “oh good for him” shit anymore, dude is a problem.  Mikal is a legitimately 40% 3pt shooter nowadays, and damn that’s real nice lol.  Javale McGee was unironically one of the best signings of the off season. Exactly what the Suns needed, a stop gap when Ayton isn’t in the game. Rebounding, defense, rim protection, very good finishing, penalizing switches in the post, and good screens when Ayton isn’t in the game.... damn, isn’t that nice.   Thank god for that amazing 3rd quarter, bc that 4th was rough. Opposite night I guess."

"Well, enjoy Devin Booker while you can. He’s moving to LA the second he can lol"
"&gt;If they had 80 sources, I would have thought they had more dirt on him and wouldn't need to resort to using Earl Watson so much who was bitter about being fired. Earl Watson gives himself a lot of credit for unlocking Devin Booker and makes it seem like the reason he got fired was because he wanted to give the reigns to Booker instead of the veterans on the team so a lot of Suns fans have a slight hesitation with him.  So how is that a bad thing? You’d guys rather build around vets who can’t win a playoff game than Booker?  It’s also funny how the “Sarver is the devil” talk suddenly went out of flavor with Suns fans"

"They've gone from Spalding to Wilson but in theory it's supposed to be basically identical because Wilson are copying the old Spalding balls (minus the logo) as opposed to bringing in their own builds.   The design is supposed to be the same but several players have complained about it feeling different.  Devin Booker said it felt like the balls were different every night, whereas Spalding was consistent."
MVP is very narrative driven. I have a hard time seeing Jimmy win the MVP without crazy stats - given he was also on the team last year.   Like there's a reason why CP3 was in the MVP discussion last year instead of Devin Booker. It's really all about the narratives.
"&gt; Jamal when he was maxed was very inconsistent and was averaging 18/4/5 on 54 ts% with bad defense. That type of player is not worth a max. This is a fact proven by the existence of players of similar caliber none of which are getting paid the max. The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract. I think you're thinking of supermax contracts which come after something like that.   Why? Because a team sees clear evidence in growth in the player as they've been in their system for years. They see a higher ceiling and as they mature and gain more experience (like every player in league history) they will become more consistent.   Otherwise they get the rookie extension which is for players like Grayson Allen, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma, Luke Kennard, Markelle Fultz, etc. or the let Jamal Walk into RFA and feel disrespected or not believed in by the team, another team with the space gives him the max and then Denver matches it but with 1 less year on the contract.  &gt; The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  Well...yeah. Of course. He had the same first 3 years as Devin Booker but just had less shots because Jokic was there. Same as Donovan Mitchell. All of these players are getting this contract based on their potential to grow and the teams belief that they will reach that potential. No player is an actualized or realized player at 21 or 22 years old.   When Jokic was averaging 18/11/6 did they sign him thinking that was going to be his peak? Of course not. When Mitchell was averaging 24/4/4 and shooting terribly from 3 and playing 0 defense did the Jazz sign him to the rookie max thinking that was the player they were going to get forever? No.  &gt; Reaching his potential or even improving at all was in no way a given.  A generic statement that can be applied to any player ever. Embiid being able to play 1/2 of a season when he got his extension wasn't a given. Trae Young finding a way to not be the worst defender at his position in the league and shoot better than 43 from the floor or 34 from 3 isn't a given--but he got his max. Fox turning out to not just be a stat accumilator on a terrible team when he was given his max isn't a given. KAT not being a black hole on offense and a terrible defensive player when he was given his max wasn't a given.   &gt; There were some things that were encouraging and would leave you to believe he's gonna improve, there were also huge red flags that would lead you to believe the opposite.  I don't know what red flags you're talking about. Year 1 to year 2 Jamal had a massive jump. Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up. Year 3 to year 4 Jamal took another step up in all areas and then obviously we saw the bubble. Then sure enough year 4 to year 5 was another giant step up.  There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.   &gt;  Waiting a year for him to hit RFA would've cost them nothing and alleviated a lot of the risk.  This isn't 2K. There is a human element to showing belief and trust in your player, especially for this Nuggets team and management, especially for all small market teams. You don't just get to let someone go to RFA and pretend like that doesn't stick with them, upset them, be in the back of their mind when they come up for free agency down the road. That's life. It has happened time and time again. If you think your player is worth matching a max in RFA then you max him on your own, otherwise you just bothered a cornerstone player of your franchise and also signed him to 1 less year than you could have.  &gt; Just because he turned out to be worth the max doesn't make maxing him a smart decision.   I guess it's a good thing that our front office of professionals designed to scout, draft, evaluate, train, and put players in positions to succeed before assessing the risk of 9-figure paydays knows better than you what is and isn't a 'smart decision'. It was a bad take then and I'm sure people let you hear it at that point just as they are now. It was a smart decision as a team, as a franchise, as a culture building organization, and as a small market team. No brainer.  &gt; This wasn't/isn't a reactionary take, all of you are just braindead.  Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong. It is the children who are out of touch!"
"You cut out the best part  &gt;""Chris Paul and Devin Booker are All-Stars, but Deandre Ayton is a quality center, Jae Crowder is an experienced, quality stretch-four man that’s tough, Cam Johnson is nice and **Mikal Bridges is my favorite small forward in the league.""**"
Give the kid a chance. We haven’t seen enough for Bust talk yet. But wow Jalen Green is already amazing. The Pistons always pick the wrong guy. Detroit took Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell.
"of the three players named in the op, only devin booker is in a shooting slump."
"You're hearing from a first person source, Devin Booker that all of the balls feel different to him. It's not far fetched to believe there's another manufacturing issue at play if that's the case. Imagine thinking you think you know more than Mr. Booker. You're extremely dense."
Devin Booker for MVP?
"Winning or Losing isn't the point OP is making. This was a mistake from the officiating crew who couldn't keep track of something as basic as the team foul count. You shouldn't have to correct the score two possessions after the foul, especially in the fourth of a close game.  Similar to Devin Booker playing with 10 fouls or something in the 21 Finals. Just because Milwaukee won that game, doesn't excuse the obvious incompetence of the officials."
Two suns stat lines stand out to me.  CP3 4 points 18 assists. *nice*  Devin Booker 3-16 shooting. *oof*
Am I tripping or does Cam Johnson kind of look like Devin Booker in the face a little bit.
Less talented players.  Devin Booker seems like the worst player on the court and is taking all the shots.
"Suns are just ass this year outside of Ayton. With Ayton, they're still ass.   Devin Booker looks like a terrible version of Tim Hardaway Jr"
"Elfrid Payton isn't good at basketball and keeps playing  Devin Booker is just bad so far  Suns in general suck. So called shooters can't shoot, bench scorer Landry Shamet is struggling to average 5 points a game"
"I think that's fair.   I tend to be very strict when it comes to these labels and that's mostly me being a choosy asshole more than anything else.  You can certainly make an argument for the rest of the top 10 players in the league and it'd be very difficult for me to argue against it. Luka, Dame, Jokic, and Embiid certainly are must watch players.  I feel pretty confident in saying that Tatum isn't a superstar yet though. He's comfortably in the same category as players like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Green, KAT, and Zach LaVine (I'm probably missing a few guys here). Each of these guys certainly have upwards projections."
"Okay but the Bulls have low key circumvented this completely, I got an Instagram ad from skillshare and I'm gonna paraphrase here, but it was basically like, 'Are you a PG like Damian Lillard? SG like Devin Booker? Or a PF like DeMar DeRozan?'   I was like.. huh? PF? DeMar? I haven't watched the Bulls enough (despite having Vuc, Caruso, DJJ and Javonte on my fantasy team—I had Patrick before he went down and picked up DJJ/Javonte when I saw the news) but I'm assuming with Caruso, Javonte/Dosunmu, Lonzo and Lavine that they are running somewhat of a 3 guard set with DeMar guarding 4's? There's no way all five of those guys are averaging 25+ minutes a game without someone logging minutes at the 4."
if he's such a good defender why did Jayson Tatum let Devin Booker drop 70 on him 🤔
"Hes the cp3 of yall team. Zach lavine is still devin booker but in the clutch, leading the team and making the plays, its still derozan as the mvp. Controversial to say given its been zachs team and he scores more and hits 3s but derozan still seems to be the best guy there. Lavine has a higher ceiling though"
"Anyone have the numbers like this, but for Devin Booker this year?! I feel like I see a lot of 9-20 stat lines."
"I always think that you need to evaluate a pick relative to the players who could have been picked in that spot. There's always going to be someone better taken way deeper in the draft, but the point is usually that NOBODY saw that guy coming.  Most of the time teams are, in practice, choosing between 3-5 players. So the question is, was the guy taken better than the next 3-5 guys taken?  So with Kendall Marshall, both John Henson and Mo Harkless had better careers, and they were the next two picks. That makes it a clear bad pick. (IN fact, four of the next five picks had better careers. Oof.)  On the other hand, Alex Len - you look at the next few picks, and they're not clearly better than Alex Len by a large margin until you get to CJ McColumn. So you say he wasn't worthy of the #5 pick but that's actually fairly typical return for a #5 pick: solid rotation guy, nothing special. So that's not a bad pick.   TJ Warren went two picks ahead of Nurkic, but was better than the other guys around there. Solid pick.  Devin Booker was picked ahead of a bunch of other decent players, which makes that pick look ever better. Lots of plausible picks and they got the best one!  Dragan Bender, OTOH, is an awful pick. The guys taken after him (Dunn, Hield, Murray, Chriss, Poetl) are all better.   And Josh Jackson is more borderline than I think you're giving them credit for. D'Aaron Fox, Johnathan Issac, Lauri Markinnen, Frank Nkitolina, Dennis Smith, Jr? Josh is neither the best nor the worst of those players. Going to the G-league as a rookie isn't a bit deal for a young guy. He look to have the makings of a serviceable backup big.  2018 obviously they should have taken Luka.   2019 since they must have drafted for the trade, hard to evaluate based on thee quality of the player.   And with Smith they could have had Haliburton ... and now they declined his option? Wow. Yeah. Huge mistake.  So there are a couple of howlers there, but also some of those picks aren't as bad as they look."
"That face when Alex Len is 100x more valuable than the 4 other top-10 picks (Jalen Smith \[10\], Josh Jackson \[4\], Dragan Bender \[4\], Marquese Chriss \[7\]) in the past 15 years the Suns have had combined.  Apparently the Suns just need to draft in the low-teens from now on.  * Cam Johnson -- 11th pick 2019 * Devin Booker -- 13th pick 2015 * TJ Warren -- 14th pick 2014 * Kendall Marshall -- 13th pick 2012  (Fucking eww, never knew why we did this) * Markieff Morris -- 13th pick 2011 (Even with him being a dickhead, he's still a serviceable NBA player) * Earl Clark -- 14th pick 2009 (We held out hope for so long on him) * Robin Lopez -- 15th pick 2008 (We bitched about him so much until we lost him and had Len as a starter, who we bitched about until we lost him and had continuous garbage as starters until Ayton)"
"Trading Chauncey Billups for Allen Iverson. Haven’t won a playoff game since..  Another terrible one was taking Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell, when Mitchell didn’t miss a single shot in his workout. Or taking Stanley Johnson over Devin Booker, a Pistons fan 🤦🏾‍♂️"
"I gotta go with Mike Conley.   He gets spoken about like a top 5 pg alot back then in the grit and grind era. He gets paid like devin Booker Zach lavine level. He got put into the the all star game last season for being being ""snub"" all those years.   Half his accomplishments will be broken by ja morant by 5 seasons.   Then kemba walker. He shoots below average and he's only been able to go to the playoffs I think twice in that decade.  Then mike D toni  as a coach. Other than doc rivers which is obvious for many reasons has been soooo lucky to be put in opportunities to coach stacked teams.   Gifted Melo knicks. Turned out bad. Linsanity was talked the most about.   Gifted the super stack 2012 lakers. Turned out bad and kobe gets injured trying to carry.   Gifted the rockets. Couldn't even beat the warriors that one year and had harden with super star after superstar."
Devin booker 3 point shooting
"Meanwhile, Devin Booker will get the foul called for him, wait 5 seconds, take the shot, and it will count"
The Celtics aren't on shit. And Jayson Tatum is closer to the Devin Booker/Trae Young tier than Jimmy Butler and Paul George  Zion's gonna come back healthy and make a big mid-season push for the Pels.  Cam Reddish is going to establish himself as the 3rd best player from his class.  The Bulls are going to run through the regular season but get trounced in the 1st round.

"Lemarcus ""Devin 'Kawhi Leonard' Booker"" Aldridge"
"OKC fans dubbed the 2014-2015 season the plagues of Egypt Season.   Our starting line up was Russ Roberson KD Serge Adams  We also had Reggie Jackson until the trade deadline. If I am remembering correct. KD, Russ, Ibaka, and Jackson started the season injured. There are a couple others I think I am forgetting. Russ and KD came back full strength around December only for them to be in and out of the line up the whole year. When we finally traded Jackson and got fully healthy in March KD got injured again. It was horrible. We missed the playoffs by one game on an Anthony Davis buzzer beater basically. It was the season from hell. To top it all off we got the 14th pick which ended up being Cam Payne. One spot behind Devin Booker!"
"Devin Booker is shooting 40% right now from the field, his issue isn't a lack of free throws."
Haha yea me too bro. In the meantime I’ll be living my NBA dreams thru Devin Booker and hoping he succeeds
"uhhh malcolm brogdon is scoring 23 a game. if he can do it, so can damian lillard and devin booker lol some guys are just off to slow starts. dame bricking 3s has nothing to do with foul changes."

"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"Yeah he's nuts. As far as I'm concerned him and Scottie are 1a and 1b as future of this franchise, he has that Devin Booker type scoring potential."
"Jimmy proved a year ago he could be the number 1 guy. He averaged 26/8/10 in the finals on 66% TS. Devin Booker just averaged 28/4/4, albeit on below average efficiency but he’s clearly good enough to be the go to guy and he took over in multiple games last postseason.   Demar has an inconsistent postseason history and we haven’t seen what Zach can do in the postseason either."
My favorite [clutch](https://youtu.be/WLYPwrNgrOY) Devin Booker moment
Devin booker is still underrated in my opinion
No that's Devin Booker. We made like 85% of his foot on the line twos last season
This Devin Booker guy is kind of a good scorer
"Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Kevin Johnson, Mikal Bridges, Dan Majerle, Devin Booker, Walter Davis, Shawn Marion, Amar’e Stoudamire, Charles Barkley, Vince Carter + Shaq"
"Holy fucking shit Devin Booker is scorching, he made that random floater three lmao"
For real. I remember in the middle of our comeback season last year ESPN doing some spot about how Devin Booker should go to the Knicks. If you can't swing a story towards a major media market then they're just not gonna bother.
"Devin Booker has a rat face, and so by extension I think the suns are a team of rats, and the city of phoenix needs to exterminate their rodent problem."
I don't remember this kind of reaction when Devin booker tried to fight Gorgui Dieng in the tunnel.
"Maybe I should say 3 best players. I don't think anybody that isn't overdosing on crack would argue that. Let's break down some facts. Mpj had the second most efficient 20 point season of all time last season (look it up). Jamal Murray was putting up stats comparable to Devin Booker and Donavon Mitchell, what non crack head would aregure that they aren't max players? Mpj and Mal have missed less time over the last 3 seasons than Klay Thompson. Is Klay Thompson an overpaid broken toy?"
Alex Caruso got more allstar votes than Devin Booker lol
I 100% subscribe to the conspiracy theory that refs make entertainment-based calls in crunch time.  Tyler getting fouled like fuck and bodied out of bounds and getting no-called by a team trying to mount a comeback is just one example. Most obvious recent example is when Devin Booker took an intentional 6th foul in the finals and the refs just didn't call it because they didn't want a star player out.
I want Ben Simmons and Devin Booker on the same team. Kendall’s ex and her boyfriend. A movie. Or Karl Towns and Tristan Thompson on the same team. Will Jordyn still sit courtside???
Devin booker killed my dog
"right now? James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal,  Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Karl Anthony Towns, arguably Demar Derozan"
"The Suns were hated long before CP3 and Devin Booker. Just ask [Kobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl5pjyHjIgs)   We were terrible so long that people forgot how much the Suns used to hassle the west other than the Spurs, especially because Kobe was on the rise and Nash beat out Shaq for back to back MVPs which he still hasn't let go. Sarver having a bad rep is a factor. I personally don't have any bravado towards our chances this season and am not looking forward to the dirty bomb that's gonna pop off when we play GSW regardless of who wins. Kinda was more comfortable sucking."
"He also shares the ball with high volume scorers  Harden, Westbrook, Curry, Klay, Kyrie, and Harden again  You put KD on the Suns team instead of Booker when Devin dropped 70 KD would probably go for Kobes record"
"Chris Paul is dirty, Devin Booker is dirty, and Jae crowder is dirty.   Plus just CP3 being such a little bitch. That’s why for me at least"
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
Is Devin Booker saying Ayton is slow to develop and his rudimentary playstyle requires more variety? - ESPN  I'm playing. ESPN doesn't give a shit about the Suns
Devin Booker isn’t even CLOSE to Kobe-like and should stop getting compared. It’s getting really tired
All I’m seeing from this list is unrefutable proof Melo and Curry are better then LeBron and Lillard and Harden are the same level of basketball player as LeBron. And that clearly makes Devin Booker the goat of this era.
"&gt; Devin Booker: Won in 2018 during the Disastrous Suns Era.  The real question here is did you not say that Buddy Hield (whose name you spelt incorrectly) won during the Disastrous Kings Era because you've got a Kings flair or because the Disastrous Kings Era is so long that ""Era"" really sells it short?"
He's made me dislike the Suns purely out of association. When I see Devin Booker on TV I call him Devin Booger. I like Ayton though. The rest of the team I just don't like. Them losing to Giannis was so immensely gratifying.
"Suns fan chiming in about how Pat Bev is a piece of trash. Not only did he tear Westbrook's meniscus in the playoffs, he literally head-butted Devin Booker in the face and broke his nose on live television in the conference finals, and blindside whiplashed Chris Paul. Yet all the LA stans and national media outlets last year were saying ""Wow, Bev plays such incredible, physical defense, what a stud!"" Now Wolves fans are like ""this guy is great"", but you know what? He's an asshole, and I can't wait for his body to break down, force him to retire, and then be forgotten like the shithead nobody he is."
I want to jump out of a window every time I hear Devin Booker and Kobe mentioned in the same sentence.
"durant's a marathoner, not a sprinter  no offense to someone like devin booker but nothing about his career, including his 70 point game is anywhere close to as impressive as kd's insane scoring consistency throughout his entire career tbh"
and Devin Booker is on their team lmao
The devin booker “being the next Kobe” last year’s playoffs was so forced and made me hate him. Plus Lavine is better then him and it’s not even close.
"Phoenix Suns had the most overrated run I've ever seen last year in the playoffs and all that Devin ""Next Kobe"" Booker shit is fucking hilarious, this man wishes he was even half as skilled as the Mamba   Doc Rivers is the biggest fraud in the whole national basketball association and the fact he still has a job after 3x 3-1 blown leads is fucking beyond me   Montrezl Harrell can eat a dick"

So he can guard Ja Morant 1 on 1? Or even old Lebron James? James Harden? KD? Chris Paul? Devin Booker? Jimmy Butler? Kyle Lowry? Paul George?
in order of importance  1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Deandre Ayton  5. JaVale McGee  6. Cam Johnson  7. Cam Payne  8. Jae Crowder (Dario Saric if he was healthy)
Devin Booker is a superstar
&gt; hey won against a pretty good Mavs team a couple days ago  Luka didn't play   &gt; and nearly won by 30 pts against the Nuggets despite a struggling Devin Booker.  Literally missing all 3 of their best players  I know suns fans love memeing about playing injured teams but doesnt mean facts go out the window
That Devin booker is a bad defender or  is a average playmaker
"This sub loves hyping up the Warriors, but why is no one talking about the defending Western Conference Champion Suns being 12-3?  I didn't realize until now that the Suns are currently 12-3.. why is no-one talking about this?  They won against a pretty good Mavs team a couple days ago and nearly won by 30 pts against the Nuggets despite a struggling Devin Booker. And from what I know they're just about fully healthy.  For anyone actively watching the Suns this season, what's the main reason for the early season success? You would think they'd have trouble building up motivation to start the season after their amazing Finals run.."
* Devin Booker * CP3 * Deandre Ayton * Jae Crowder * Mikal Bridges * Cam Payne * Cam Johnson * Javale Mcgee
"Well lebrons played like 13 years longer than Giannis but I’ll give it my best  Here’s a two minute long video of giannis kicking his leg out under peoples feet after they shoot, it’s got like 5 or 6 different examples in it https://youtu.be/JzkbmlAjIwU  Here’s a video of him doing it to Kyrie  https://youtu.be/H62TbXugOqQ  Here’s a video of him tackling Mike dunleavy  https://youtu.be/GWajqr55HFg  Here’s a video of him head butting Mo Wagner and getting ejected  https://youtu.be/SnNED3DsoL4  Here’s a video of giannis undercutting Devin booker in mid-air https://youtu.be/BG7A2lhaXho  So there’s about 10 videos here all with different levels of dirtyness, again in a much smaller time frame than lebrons entire career. Some of these are pretty bad. My point is, every player makes dirty plays at some point   EDIT: I want my $50"
"1. The amount of games suspended in the rule book (Section 12) is not specified. It's to the commissioner's discretion. So you look at precedent. Chris Paul, Rondo and Ingram got different levels of suspension for their roles. CP3 got 2 games for instigating and an eye poke, Rondo got 3 games for a punch, Ingram for 6 games for the push on Harden and the missed punch.   Going off this, Lebron probably gets 2 games max. Might even be 1 or none because he's Lebron. 2 sounds reasonable though.  Stewart who didn't throw a punch at all, never swung either. All he did was be untimely to leave the court. Paragraph D of section 12 (rules and fines) says he should get a max of a 50k fine. Nothing in there about games suspended and as far as I can remember when Devin Booker got ejected and wanted to fight in the tunnel, he didn't get a game suspension. It would be harsh and out of precedent to ban Stewart at all.  Edit: link to rule book  https://official.nba.com/rule-no-12-fouls-and-penalties/"
"&gt;	 Lol someone might want to look up how Devin Booker rim frequency was even lower in the 2021 playoffs then now.  I was with you until this. Bro it’s the playoffs, of course his rim frequency is lower, the playoffs are the most physical basketball period, regardless of rules."
Unpopular opinion but this whole thing feels like a stretch and is what you see on here with people projecting what they want to be true about these rule changes mattering more than they do because they like them. Like arguing Devin Booker is going to the rim less because of rule changes? Lol someone might want to look up how Devin Booker rim frequency was even lower in the 2021 playoffs then now. I like Ben but all of this just felt like projection and kind of lazy also
"I mean, you say you'd prefer it but also; grass isn't always greener. When the majority of the attention on your team is about their best player leaving to go play for the Lakers you'd appreciate *something* else to balance out the discussion. I know the Nets coverage is sitting a little bit in this territory, but it's something different to, say, last season when the Suns are having one of the best seasons they've had in recent memory, just became one of the best teams in the league, and for a full week you have to hear how Devin Booker should request a trade to the Knicks."

"devin booker is a ridiculously good player though he'll be a many time all star all-nba player in the next few years  he is one of the 15-20 best players in the NBA right now, that guy is so so good and so consistent.  and his team is great"
"I think it's very obvious that Devin Booker is an all-star calibre player. I don't get your point. He is a top 15-20 player in the league, that isn't detrimental to Wiggins."
"Bro even Devin Booker has yet to make an All-Star team where he hasn't been an injury replacement and he's completely far better than Wiggins.      Wiggins could not ""also be an all-star"""
[Damn so that's who Devin Booker called up for the Meet Me In The Tunnel Special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6VinMvCawc)
Devin Booker could literally sign at the sign deadline in 18 years with the best team in the league and probably win a title. At worst case scenario. Lol. He could also easily help a team make the finals and win.
Enjoy getting owned by Devin Booker again in the 2 vs 7 matchup
People who put up stats on non winning teams because it’s easy to blame them for losses  Bobby Portis  Zach Lavine  Devin Booker  Dwight   Wiggins  TJ Warren
Devin Booker kinda ruined this.  He was the posterboy for it and now just won 11 straight games.  Not to mention two games from a championship.
Devin Booker aswell
"Ben for rookie Durant from the Sonics, or no deal - Morey.  Salaries might even match, just need the Sonics to invent a time machine to throw into the bargain, so we can undraft Okafor and Fultz and pick up Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell as our backcourt duo instead (sorry Seth, sacrifices had to be made).  As a compensation to Seattle, we allow them to change the timeline so Oklahoma City never steals their team as a result of how bad their roster is without Durant at that time, and share the secrets of ""The Process""."
"As of right now the Wolves don't have an allstar. LeBron and AD will both make the allstar game, even if the Lakers are barely above .500, which will take away the possible frontcourt spot KAT could get. Guard is way too freaking deep for Edwards to make it, and as you can see from this breakdown, there will be an overflow of guards into the wildcard spots, making it so the bare mininum of 6 frontcourt players make it.   **Starters**  * Stephen Curry * Luka Doncic * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic  **Reserves**  * G - Donovan Mitchell * G - Chris Paul * F - Paul George * F - Draymond Green * F - Rudy Gobert * W - Devin Booker * W - Ja Morant"
Is Devin Booker considered a “superstar” I know some will say yes off name recognition but I still don’t see him there but I think he’s next up.
Let me introduce you to our good friends Christopher Paul and Devin Armani Booker.
I love Devin Booker
"""the late great Kobe Bryant, he told Devin Booker; 'be legendary', he now has a tattoo saying that"""

"A brief explanation -   John Wall team failed  2012-we won  2015 team - Went 38-1 record, Harrison twin dribbled it off his leg in crunch time. /r/nba notoriously has bad college bball takes imo, they will badly argue that Devin Booker/Tyler Ulis should have been playing instead but forget that Harrison twins had one of the all time miracle runs in the 2014 NCAA tournament to take Kentucky to the finals. Devin Booker also could not guard a lamp post in college, so the Harrison twins were the correct decision, it's just really hard to go 40-0 at Kentucky.   2017 - Fox/Monk/Bam team had their hopes dashed by John Higgins referee making calls like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8j5d4ixo\_k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8j5d4ixo_k) throughout the game. Even though the biased referee tried to make us lose, the game still came down to one shot which North Carolina made. Had they missed that shot I believe we would have won a championship.   Immanuel Quickey/Tyrese Maxey year - This team was hitting their strides at the end of the year and I was convinced we would get to at least a Final Four and then Covid happened and the tournament was cancelled. Convince me this team didn't have a good shot when these two are so good. Quickley had the outside shooting, both of them could score floaters at will, and Maxey lives for the big time moments. Too bad we didn't get to see them shine together."
"Jimmy Butler has been significantly better than LeBron, given that LeBron has not played much. I would say  SF: Butler, George, Derozan, and then perhaps LeBron and Tatum  Even as a Mavs fan, I dont think I can say Luka has been the 2nd best PG.  PG: Steph, Ja Morant, Trae Young, Luka, and then I see one of CP3, Lillard, and SGA  I also don't think Harden has been the best SG. I would say that Lavine, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and Jaylen Brown may all have had a slightly more successful season than Harden so far."
"Man people throw that comparison too early 😂first it was devin booker, then Jayson tatum, who's next?"
I remember empty stats being a knock on Devin Booker
Wym salty? The Suns lost. The Celtics blew them out. And Devin Booker played through garbage time against the 3rd stringers.  It doesn’t belong in the same sentence as Kobe’s 81 pt game

[Devin Booker](https://streamable.com/r8w2cb)
Devin Booker is playing at an All-NBA level right now imo and it's just amazing to watch.
That Devin Booker bailout with no plays drawn up was our entire offense 3 years ago lmao
Where is Devin Armani Booker?
"Another thing to consider was Kobe would do whatever it took to win. In 2010 Kobe was the game 7 leading rebounder. He out rebounded kg/gasol/Bynum and everyone else. He was playing with a broken finger on his shooting hand and his shot wasn’t falling so he took over the glass as a 6’5 guard in a finals game. That’s insane, like imagine devin booker in last years finals put rebounding Lopez/ayton/Giannis in the last game to help secure a win. It would make people shit a brick"
It's so sad to see. He really fell off the face of the earth.  Also shout out to r/nba for comparing him and Devin Booker :D
"Listen man, Harden can put up 50 when he wants. 50 is child's play. 50 is baby Devin Booker stuff. He's bigger than it. If you can't see that, you don't know Nets basketball. Harden is the new GOAT. He's changing the game. You saw how Steph made dudes chuckers at the local Y. Harden is getting those same dudes to grow beards, shoot lefty, and do nosebleed taunts when they go up for ferocious layups. Don't you dare disrespect the man like that ever again."
"I honestly don't think the last few years have really shown it to be that breakable.   If you look at players in the modern era who come close you have two: Kobe and Devin Booker. Both played almost every minute of the game, both shot about 50% of all attempts, both shot way above their averages, both got a massive number of FTA, and most importantly both still fell way short (19 for Kobe and 30 for Booker).  These were two players playing out of their minds in perfect conditions and still came up really short if you think about it."
I think they'd be more like Kawhi but more shots or a better Devin Booker with defense. Kobe wasn't super heavy PnR like pre CP3 Rockets Harden and his iso spots were really different than Harden's.  Definitely capable of playing a style like that but they didn't play like that. M
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"He was also out nearly half the season last year, then came back and got whooped by Devin Booker. Yet y'all say but ""dae Kang was injured so it doesn't count"". No one else get passes like that."
"Lol ok ... I'm totally with you and this whole post but Jimmy and PG, lol. No.  I'd take Trey Young and Devin Booker though."
"&gt; In impact entries that take on and off court splits in addition to box scores stats into account he was top 5 in the the postseason from 2015-19.  Can you share any non-cumulative ones of these so we can look over them to see if that's measuring how valuable Draymond is as a singular player, compared to his value compared to the player replacing him in the Warriors scheme?   &gt; ""aNd NevEr HaS bEeN"" it was literally the most valuable skill in the league for 30 years. You know one player won 11 rings off the back off of his defence.  Which 30 years were those? Because defense was, uh, not particularly existent in the 50s and 60s. Even when you're speaking of Bill Russell and those Celtics teams, they were constantly at the top of the league in PPG and played at the highest pace in the 60s. The only reason why they didn't have the #1 ORTG every season was because of that insane pace leading to, well, more questionable shots than usual. Even by those standards.  You could make the argument that it was their defense that allowed them to have such a high scoring offense I suppose but that's pretty cyclical. I mean look at the 63 East Finals against a lousy defensive team in the Royals.   Game 1: **Royals 135** Celtics 132  Game 2: **Celtics 125** Royals 102  Game 3:** Royals 121** Celtics 116 Game 4:** Celtics 128** Royals 110  Game 5: **Celtics 125** Royals 120  Game 6: **Royals 109** Celtics 99  Game 7: **Celtics 142** Royals: 131   Or what about the 66 Finals vs. the Lakers?   Game 1:** Lakers 133** Celtics 129  Game 2: **Celtics 129** Lakers 109  Game 3: **Celtics 120** Lakers 106  Game 4: **Celtics 122** Lakers 117  Game 5: **Lakers 121** Celtics 117  Game 6: **Lakers 123** Celtics 115  Game 7: **Celtics 95** Lakers 93  Russell, Havlicek, and Sam averaged 23 a piece, West and Baylor averaged 34 and 25 respectively. I implore you to go watch some tape from the 50s and 60s and try to come away with the opinion that defense was the premier skill and reason for winning back then. Hell I'd say stamina was more of a factor for winning then than defense, considering it was just a track meet up and down the court every game.  &gt; Draymond performed like a low level MVP candidate in his prime  He has only had votes casted for him one time in his entire career. That was the 15-16 record season setting where he came in 7th and his teammate, Steph Curry, was the unanimous MVP. Because Mike Fratello and John Denton had him aas their #2 MVP. Denton who had Avery Bradley as his #2 in DPOY voting, case the sole 6th man vote for...Allen Crabbe... Fratello who had LMA and Pau Gasol on his All-NBA 1st team. Cmon now. Even Draymond said in an interview he couldn't believe he got those two votes.  You are conflating the value that Draymond receives from being on some of the greatest teams of all time compared to his actual standalone value. No doubt he is a big part of those teams, but to suggest his standalone value as a player is anywhere near the quality of an MVP is past even the most fervent of fandom takes. I like Draymond as a player, a lot. He does truly unique things. If you put him on any other team besides the Warriors his value drops off a cliff. If you put any other ""MVP"" players on a different team, ever, their value does not change much.   You would have to suggest that Draymond is account for 20+ points negated on defense alone to have the same standalone impact as an MVP caliber player, which would be by far the most of all time by lightyears.  By every single defensive metric you're going to find, Rudy Gobert is a more impactful defender than Draymond Green. In fact Gobert has a number of the best defensive seasons of all time. Rudy had the highest DRAPTOR rating of all time last year at +8 going back to 77. The highest DRPM since 1996. #1 and #3 DEPM seasons since 04. DLEBRON says he has the #1 and #4 best defensive seasons of all time. He has the single season record for most team points allowed since 06-07.   This was all last season.  So by every ""impact"" and ""performance"" metric there is, the solid ones or as solid as you can be since defensive metrics are kinda meh, Gobert is a vastly superior defender than Draymond, and last season might have been the best defensive season of all time. Did you feel like he was an MVP candidate? Was he even a low-level candidate? Probably not something you had ever considered and you might not consider it right now either.   &gt; AD is no doubt a better scorer but most most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let's not undersell that first point.   Draymond's best scoring season was on the 73 win warriors where he scored 14 points a game on 49/39/68. Excluding this season he would never average over 45% from the floor again or over 30% from 3 again. Nor did he before that. No doubt Draymond is a better passer, that's part of his role in that offense because he cannot score at an NBA level. He averages 5 more assists a game than AD for his career.  AD is not used as a passer even if he is better than we think because he is an elite scorer. He is the guy people like Draymond pass the ball to. He is on a streak of 9 straight 20+ ppg seasons. 7 of which are over 24 points. 4 of which are over 26. 2 of which are over 28. Obviously on much better efficiency than Draymond from every shooting location that is tracked. He's not just a better scorer. Most years he double or triples Draymond's scoring.   Even considering Draymond's elite positional passing and being on historic offenses he only cracks the top 20 of OWS once. That 15-16 outlier season for him where he was 10th. AD is top 20 6 times, and top 5 4 times.   Draymond has never been top 20 in OBPM. Anthony Davis has not only been top 20 6 times but he is 14th overall in NBA history by that measure.  The levels of value on offense that AD is greater than Draymond, even when Draymond sits on these historic offensive teams that are the absolute perfect positions for him imaginable in all of NBA history, are staggering. They cannot even be mentioned in the same breath. Draymond is like if you fused a non-rebounding Dennis Rodman with a non-scoring Andre Miller. AD is one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.   &gt; most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let me make it clear. I don't care about championships in this discussion, nor do I think it's particularly relevant when assessing the individual talent of players. Especially in this case however, because there is no case that Draymond is a #1, 2, or 3 offensive option on his team--so there isn't a discussion to be had like Jokic vs. AD wherein you can suggest Jokic is that extra level better because he's a true all game #1 option that leads to winning.   As Gilbert Arenas said in regards to the 75th Anni List redo he did, ""Championships are the cherry on top of the sundae, stats, all-nbas, all-stars, individual achievements are the sundae. Championships are just this extra thing on top of that to be a tie breaker or a nudge over the edge.""   So while AD did go crazy in the bubble, and conspiratorial as it may be I think that he and the Lakers got some serious help from the refs, it's not like it was some outlier among outliers like Draymond 15-16 season. Certainly his bubble run (28/10/3.5/1/1.5 on 57/38[3 attempts]/73) was better than his other playoff seasons (31/11/2/1/3 on 54/00/89 and 31/13/2/2/2 on 52/27[2 attempts]/83) shows he is still an elite playoff performer. In fact when you account for the fact he was on wildly worse teams than that LA team in 15 and 18 where teams could double and swarm him all game, compared to a Lakers team with LeBron and shooters, and the fact that most shooters got hot in that bubble, it's even less of a staggering outlier.  As far as being effective as a scorer in isolation in 19-20 AD was in the 71st percentile for isolation scorers. Not elite but certainly not ineffective. That was better than players like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and around the same as Jason Tatum and CP3.   As you can imagine Draymond is in the no-percentile on that because they would never isolate Draymond. Additionally playmaking is more than assists, which Draymond is an elite passer especially for his position but he is not a good playmaker.   Playmaking is not passing, that's just one component of it. Playmaking comes from being a threat to get places on the court to score or pass.  The more of those places and the more ways you can do that, the better a playmaker you are. The play part of playmaking is there for a reason, and there are many more plays than a pass. Otherwise we'd call it a passmaker. Draymond isn't a threat to score, he isn't a threat for the defense to collapse in on, his passing comes from passing to people off screens or when the defense makes a mistake because his IQ is great. It also comes from his elite 2 man game with Curry, the best shooter of all time who is going to convert a lot of those assists. But a playmaker he is not.   &gt; Its the same with Giannis and Embiid as well. Their scoring is brilliant but their value in the postseason comes from their standout defence.  No. It comes from both. I don't even really understand how you can come to the conclusion that their value in the postseason comes from their standout defense more than their scoring, let alone the sole value.

"""Devin Booker continues to improve in so many areas"" as a graphic is showing the exact opposite"
"Now that the Suns have Chris Paul, it would be fun to see them start using Devin Booker in more creative off-ball plays. At least I think it would be."
"&gt;Devin Booker is an American he deserves fans that like the country he represents.  Devin Booker is a Phoenis Suns player, he deserves fans that support him as a player or the Suns as a team, no matter where they are from."
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
"No the Suns winning would be the best story ever. Devin “empty stats” Booker and CP3 winning a chip? Unbelievable, definitely no homer bias here"
"Devin Booker- yes, I agree. Bradley Beal is arguable though I'd lean Kyrie slightly. Neither have proven much of anything as the main person on their team, they're just high scoring guards."
How? Where did I even rate him? I never said where I believe he ranks in the NBA I just said he’s clearly better than Devin Booker and Bradley Beal which he absolutely is
1. James Harden 2. Bradley Beal 3. Devin Booker 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jrue Holiday 6. CJ McCollum 7. Victor Oladipo 8. Seth Curry 9. Danny Green
"What single basketball skill are Bradley Beal and Devin Booker better at than Kyrie😂finishing? No. Mid range? No. Three point shooting? Definitely not. Clutch scoring? No. Rebounding? Beal barely is but he’s taller than Kyrie. Passing? No. Ball handling? No. Defense? They’re all bad.   You literally just said those players are better because you don’t like kyrie😂kyrie is a proven champion. Those guys haven’t proven anything yet and they’re not even better at anything than Kyrie. Kyrie is better at literally everything on offense, and they’re all bad defenders, and Booker and Beal have never led good teams. So wtf are you talking about? These takes are embarrassing"
Devin Booker
"among active players, those with most rs games ando yet zero playoffs experience are:  1. Alex Len, 484 games 2. Elfrid Payton, 413 3. Julius Randle, 401 4. Zach LaVine, 376 5. Wilie Cauley-Stein, 372  **6) Devin Booker, 361**"
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
"I think he's incredibly deserving but he's going to face some stiff competition. The All-Star teams are set up to allow a maximum of 6 guard selections.      I think Curry, Lillard, Luka and Mitchell are all locks at this stage. Devin Booker or Chris Paul will likely make it due to the Suns early season success and improvement from last season. That leaves Fox to compete with guys SGA and Conley amongst guards and front court players (for a wildcard spot) like Zion, Ingram and Derozan.      At this stage of the season he has my vote and if the Kings continue their recent form (wins in 7 of their last 9 games) then it'll be hard to leave him out."
"Devin Booker bruh, I laughed.  And KAT has played like 4 games this season and missed half of last season, he's literally not been playing like at all. Kyrie is easily top 15."
"I’m sorry but Bradley Beal isn’t better at anything than Kyrie, Devin Booker, jimmy butler and KAT are definitely not better then kyrie. Devon Booker bro? Seriously?"
"Jaylen Brown &amp; Devin Booker are ahead of  several of the guys on your list so let's include them.  I'd also say SGA, CJ McCollum, Siakam, Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Ingram and Middleton are all better.  Julius Randle &amp; Ben Simmons are probably where the line is, so that's another 8-11 guys at least (I am probably forgetting some).  It's interesting to name the guys, something we almost never do, as a result there are 12 top 5 players in the league at any given time.  EDIT: I forgot De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant and Zach Lavine, would take them over Murray comfortably."
"I'll give it a stab.  Jaylen Brown,  Zion Williamson, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, KAT (if healthy), Ja Morant, Kyrie, De'Aaron Fox (arguable, but I would say so), Brandon Ingram (same thing), McCollum until he got injured (this season),  Shai (I'm high on Shai), Maybe Kemba, Probably Vucevic, Lavine."
Devin booker over Kyrie? Interesting
"In no order:  LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Jokic, Doncic, Embiid, Giannis, KD, Harden, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, KAT.   That's 17 players any sane person would take over him just on the basis of being strictly better at basketball. Then when you factor in his questionable mental state I could add on another 15-20 easily. I would say he's around top 30 at best, top 40 at worst."
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I’d put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That’s 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There’s 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."
"Don't forget Devin ""empty stats"" Booker, this is a big 3 I'd watch"

"""Yo get my man Draymond out of the Bay! It's not good for his career."" - Devin Booker"
Devin Booker is a psycho
"Devin ""~~despite the loss~~"" ""*in the win*"" Booker"
Devin Armani Booker
Our offense shifted from moving the ball to force feeding Drummond. Drummond was being really bad. Offense hasn't really recovered since.  Our defense has fallen off a cliff.  We badly miss Kevin Love. We're missing spacing and his defensive rebounding. Suns 2nd chance points really kept them in the game when it seemed like the Cavs could take a solid lead. Then Devin Booker did his thing.
"See now we can stop with the ""Is X player better than Devin Booker now?"" This is the kind of game he has when the offence goes through him playing on ball."
"tough game, Devin Booker is a bad man"
"While the Cavs subreddit was busy making fun of the way Devin Booker looks, he and Mikal were busy cooking.  GG to the Cavs regardless. Team played hard, never gave up, and kept the whole thing entertaining. You're my hometown team and I love ya, especially with the rise of SexLand."
Devin Booker
Devin Booker
Devin Booker is incredible
"Seeing that my last lineup posts were like this kinda hurts:  &gt; Nance is back from his wrist injury tonight! Let's hope for him to be ok.   \+   &gt; Shortest injury report of the season :')  &gt; And almost close to just one, I hope.  But oh well, sadly Nance is out for 4~6 weeks now, so let's hope for him to be alright!  ---  Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-14) | [](/PHX)Suns (13-9) ---|---   D. Garland |  L. Galloway  C. Sexton  |     Devin Booker Isaac Okoro |       Mikal Bridges  T. Prince |  F. Kaminsky  A. Drummond |   Deandre Ayton  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-14) | [](/PHX)Suns (13-9) ---|--- Outback Jesus (OUT)  |     J. Crowder (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |      A. Nader   (OUT)  L. Nance (OUT) |  Chris Paul    (OUT)  |  C. Payne    (OUT)  |  D. Saric   (OUT)"
"I don't think most people think Devin Booker should be an all-star this year. Donovan Mitchell is the best player on the #1 team in the NBA right now, so that adds a lot more weight than just comparing their stats. De'Aaron Fox could be an all-star this year, but it also wouldn't be crazy if he wasn't, he's on the bubble imo."
"Better: DeAndre Ayton- people look at his stats and probably think he’s having a down year, but he’s become the anchor of our defense and the reason why we never get completely killed on the boards. Also in the previous two years DA relied on plays being ran for him in order for him to make an offensive impact, but this year he’s getting most of his points recently just off his hustle and effort alone.   Worse: Devin Booker- now due to his play recently this is most likely going to change but Devin had a lot of growing pains to start the season. His play struggled mainly because he didn’t know where he was within this new team with big expectations. He struggled learning how to play within good players and when he needed to play hero ball. Often times he would either be too passive or too aggressive. Couple that with his major regression from the free throw line and turnover problem Suns fans were genuinely concerned. But it looks like he’s starting to figure it all out."
"Seriously. The knicks can easily attract a top tier A free agent. I'm talking Bradley beal, Devin Booker maybe, perhaps KAT, also wouldn't be surprised if they could be in the running for a guy like tatum. Oladipo is great but they can do better if they continue building like they have been."
I'm not particularly concerned with whether Devin Booker makes more money in a day than the average American family makes in a year...  Or whether he makes EVEN FUCKING MORE THAN THAT.
Devin Booker: perennial all-star alternate
"if Vucevic is getting an All star spot, I don't see why Trae Young doesn't deserve one. He will likely get in as a replacement (just like I think Devin Booker will). But yea, that's the only gripe in these. Otherwise, the rest of the picks seem fine."
"do me a favor, make him say Devin Booker while you ram him"
no devin booker? Shitt
had devin booker floated around a .500 record while setting numerous records and winning some high profile games against top teams then he would’ve made it
"I don't understand how people do not grasp this fact. Devin Booker has been in the league for six years. His team has been under .500 in five of those years.   Then suddenly Chris Paul shows up, and they're a game behind the Lakers.   ""Oh, Booker's better than Chris Paul.""  Did you watch what he did for OKC last year? Did you watch the way he turned one of the most moribund franchises in the NBA into a really, really good and supremely entertaining team? Did you watch the 2008 Hornets or the 2018 Rockets?   Chris Paul has literally *never* been on a bad team. A few mediocre teams. But *never* a bad team. That's because Chris Paul elevates everything around him, and has done so his whole career."
&gt; NBA coaches think devin booker is not an all-star   They sure double and triple him like an all-star
NBA coaches think devin booker is not an all-star and worse than those 3 players this season. live with it lol
"The answer would still be Zion on most teams. He is proving to be absolutely unstoppable since they started having him actually run the offense more. Devin Booker is a nice player, but ultimately no different from  about 10 other guys in the league who do similar things at a similar level."
Sometimes I think about how many All star games Devin Booker would have made by now if he was drafted 1st overall   I’m only kind of joking
"How the fuck does Brown have a green light and not Devin Booker if Brown is sharing first option with Tatum, and Booker is the first option."
"If you don’t think Devin Booker has been better in the 30 games this season, including the fact that AD has missed about a third of the season, then you should watch more games"
He became the youngest player to rob Devin Booker of a spot too.
"If you don't think Anthony Davis is a better player than Devin Booker, your fandom has blinded you."
its devin booker and its not even a conversation
"Yah. Don't believe me? Poll 30 GMs. ""Would you trade Devin Booker straight up for Zion Williamson?""   Guaranteed, more than 20 say ""absolutely."""
Appoligies up front to the other 29 teams and their fans because devin booker is gonna murder all of your teams the rest of the year.
Easily Devin Booker.
Have you watched Devin Booker defend?
"&gt; If a Suns fan says ""devin booker should be traded"" should i say that...    No. You shouldn’t be pedantic af and should just say nothing."
"Here's a hot take:   Devin Booker is a German.   Now, you have already decided to downvote this post, but hear me out:   In world soccer, there are 2 mega-forces (with Argentina being the almost-mega force) - Brazil and Germany.   Brazilians play the game of joy. They dribble, they laugh, they make acrobatics, and they make Soccer a really fun game.   Germans, even though they abandoned the 3rd reich ideas almost completely, never abandoned the work and the discipline that came with it. Their national team is super efficient and zero fun - it's like there are 11 robots on the field, all doing exactly what a soccer player should do, and not a single thing more, or unnecessary   [This is how a brazilian scores a goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH_gBJT9bAg)  Germany plays with 11 robots - unfortunately, no highlight, because all their goals are boring, they are a product of perfectly executed game of football (soccer) as much as possible played by the book  D Book, plays by the book. Which is an odd thing, being that he is a unique character with a rebel-like stance, whenever I watch the Suns, I have yet to see that ""something special"" in his game, that unique swag, that drive that would make him more like Kobe, and less like a shooting machine. He needs to be the [different animal, and the same beast](https://youtu.be/wt_MLLVcxoc?t=12), I guess."
"If advanced stats were the reason that Booker didn't make it, that's just the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.  Advanced stats are kind of laughable IMO. Have you seen Devin Booker play at all? Are you seriously trying to tell me that Booker is barely above the level of a replacement player (.4 VORP) because some numbers that are an aggregate of subjective basketball values told you so? C'mon man. It is hard to argue with 24.8 PPG on 50/38/85. Nothing about that is ""slightly above replacement level""."
"No, you're just misrepresenting things.  If a Suns fan says ""devin booker should be traded"" should i say that all suns fans want devin booker traded because that one guy said it?"
"Eh, Zion's a better player than Devin Booker."
"Devin booker impact much more on court than zion, so overrated pelicans shouldn have a all star their record is awful"
"Zion over Brandon Ingram, Demar Derozean, Devin Booker, Deaaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Christian Wood, John Wall, and so many others? I don't agree. Zion's game is limited and his team isn't good. How do the Spurs not have one all star? They're the fifth seed!"
No Devin Booker?
It’s gotta be Devin Booker
My next fantasy now is for Devin Booker to be a 6x allstar injury replacement
"100% agree, no way zion should be in all star especially over Devin booker"
"Well Devin Booker is the second all-star on Phoenix, so I'm not sure having 4 less wins is much of a factor. Worse stats are only if points are the only stats. Demar is averaging an amazing 7 assists to 2 turnovers per game. He's been great in the clutch and is unexpectedly leading his team to a 16-11 record.  The efficiency difference is also 60.3%TS for Derozan and 60.7%TS for Booker, so that's not much at all. Advanced Stats also favor Demar."
"Vucevic over Sabonis lmaooo  Winning matters, unless you’re Devin Booker. Then it’s whatever’s convenient (Zion, Ingram)."
Devin booker got screwed again lol and what the hell is vuc doing on this list
Devin Booker???
"DeMar, Devin Booker and Trae Young are the big snubs. I’m mad for DeMar, he’s been under-the-radar good this season."
Devin Booker Snubbed
Dude THANK YOU. I should just copy and pste this comment everywhere cuz you put it so perfectly lol. And super ironic that he has Devin Booker on his team... reminds me of those ppl that were poor and became rich and then hate on poor people.
"&gt;	 His teammates allegedly don't like playing with him. Collins wants to leave. He has questionable shot selection.    Yall realy love hating the sensationalism of Br and ESPN yet turn around and believe everything they say. Show me where his teammates dont like playing with him. JC doesnt WANT to leave, he wants to be paid the max and we didn’t offer it. So he’ll go where the money goes.    Lastly, you talking bout Devin Booker in your last two sentences?"
The all Kendall Jenner starting 5:  PG Jordan Clarkson  SG Devin Booker  SF Ben Simmons  PF Kyle Kuzma  C Blake Griffin
Why do you want to disrespect Devin Booker for his 71/100/100 shooting splits last night?!!!
And you can say the same thing if you take away Devin Booker
"Probably could add CJ Mccollum, Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker. Julius Randle is having a hell of a year."
Devin Booker 25/4/4 on 50/38/85 61% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25/4/5 on 43/39/83 56% TS  Chris Paul 17/5/9 on 49/40/97 59% TS  Mike Conley 16/3/6 on 44/41/82 59% TS  Demar DeRozan 20/5/7 on 49/33/89 60% TS  Three of these players should be all-stars. Tell me there is no world in which Booker deserves it.
devin booker has been on that team for years and they've never been even remotely good but now Chris Paul joins and they're playoff contenders.  I think you know which one should be the all star
Devin Armani Booker.
PG: Steve Nash  SG: Devin Booker   SF: Shawn Marion  PF: Charles Barkley   C  : Amare Stoudemire
I love watching watching Jason Tatum and Devin Booker play. Tatum seems to do a float away instead of a fade away I can’t explain it. And booker seems to get where he wants easily and most of his shots are pure net just swaps on swaps
And people are talking about whether Chris Paul *or* Devin Booker deserve an All-Star spot.
Devin Booker
"Devin Booker, Bradley Beal &amp; Seth Curry"
Devin Armani Booker
G- Luka Doncic   G- Stephen Curry   F- LeBron James   F- Anthony Davis[INJ]  F- Nikola Jokic   Bench:  G- Damian Lillard   G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard   F- Paul George   F- Rudy Gobert  WC- Devin Booker   WC- Chris Paul  INJ-REP- Zion Williamson  The only player whom I think would miss out would be DeMar DeRozan
You will remember the backcourt of Tyler Ulis and Devin Booker
I don’t care as long as Devin Booker makes it.
"Devin ""Steph Curry"" Booker sitting out 4th quarters"
Devin Booker is an all-star nuff said
"Whoever called his stats empty deserves a brain MRI to  see that there is nothing there  Empty stats are Jerry Stackhouse taking 30 shots to score 30 in a shit team not Devin Booker being efficient, a decent playmaker while scoring 25+"
I’d like to see devin booker do that
Look at Devin Booker man
Devin “Voldemort” Booker  Edit: fuck me I’m stupid of course they both look like Voldemort 😂
"Devin Booker and Zach Lavine - brothers in nerds complaining about their ""empty stats"""
"Devin Booker really is the type of guy to just pull up on you on anywhere and steal your girl, your family and your homies while casually dropping a 40 piece chicken nugget combo with all the sauces"
Devin Booker with no nose would be particularly hilarious.   Historical pick: Charlie Villanueva
Zach LaVine my favorite player after Devin Booker
Devin Booker  That is all
I meant this year. As in Devin Booker (for example) says the Suns goal is to win the championship this season. Most players don't say that.
Mentioning Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell
I don’t know but it’s kinda uncalled for. When you see dudes that have literally done nothing like Devin Booker or Bruce Brown calling him soft and a bitch that must mean a lot of dudes in the league not respect PG. I’ve never seen guys go at a star player like that ever
Jamal Murray and also Devin Booker.
"Kobe Bryant,Devin Booker, Damian Lillard,Klay Thompson"
Maybe cuz CP3 has fucking Devin Booker on his team
Beal’s putting up better numbers than last season but it’s not a drastic change. But now some people talk about him like he’s way better than Devin Booker.
I still think there's no chance Devin Booker can be your best player on a championship contender.
"people said the same about devin booker, giannis, jokic before they got better teammates."
Didn’t Devin booker say this quote first
"On similar usage which I already mentioned (do you not understand what this means?)....on far better efficiency despite facing more challenge on defence. Tell me how Devin Booker was winning before Chris Paul and Ayton came around. Funny enough, Lavine also has more winshares than Booker and his advanced metrics are better than Booker's across the board. Just admit you have no clue what you're talking about and we can move on lol"
Devin Booker clone. Premium Kevin Martin
"I'm fairly certain that, before the bubble last season, Devin Booker had never won 4 games in a row in the NBA. If it wasn't in the bubble, I know that was at least true until last season.  It's crazy how bad some teams can be for so long."
"I kinda like these tiers.  Destroyer Class: Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Steph, Harden  Wrecking Crew: Bradley Beal, Zach LaVine, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker"
"Lavine is walmart Devin Booker, big stats, bad team  Tell me when lavine going head to head with bron in the playoffs, or making the ecf   Wait, tell me when lavine just makes the playoffs,  I don't think this debate is close at all, 10/10 I'm taking Tatum"
lmao you literally compared who was more overrated in your original stance:   &gt; Devin Booker isn't overrated this sub. The most overrated player this sub is Luka Doncic by far but Beal isn't nearly as overrated as Luka yet.  fuck outta here acting like a victim.
"&gt; Hell, he’s already lead his team to playoffs which is more than Booker has done despite being drafted 3 years after Devin...  He was on a team with a bench that had a top 5 net rating in the NBA. A team with a top 5 net rating has never missed the playoffs... He carried/lead that team to 7th in the west. Not really a carry. If luka wasn't on that team last year they would have been like the Clippers before Kawhi and PG where they had no stars and were a strong team that made the playoffs.   &gt;But he’s doing things nobody has done except those 2 at his ag  He is one of the most high volume PG's ever. Even as a rookie had had a higher USG% than any year of Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Magic Johnson, and John Stockton. He also puts up uncontested Russel Westbrook style uncontested rebounding. He puts up volume stats I'll give you that. However in a league where defense and 3 point shooting is so important, Luka is very overrated and people think he is a top 15 player which is foolish."
Devin Booker isn't overrated this sub. That is Luka Doncic.
Is anything going to be done about Alex Caruso getting more votes than Devin Booker last year?
*Correction to your post: It was Cameron Payne who hit the three that broke the record not Devin Booker.
I promise you Devin Booker is not overrated on r/nba
i will never forget when miami took him over devin booker
Yes it’s devin booker all over again
Give Devin Booker a competent guard and the Suns are not a bad team. Then you got young guys improving. The Suns are a good team and bridges is awesome
"this is gonna go on for years, look at his history with Devin Booker lmao Suns fans know"
"Underrated and under hyped by bball fans and press at every level.   I keep hearing people say it's cause he's on a bad team, but Devin Booker on the pre-bubble Suns was still getting tons of attention every time he went off.   Is it cause the league was so guard focused when he entered the league?  Is it a lack of flash or charisma? Cause Vucevic been winning people fantasy leagues a couple years now.   My guess is that he just get's lost or confused in the sea of East-Euro ""ic"" talent in the league."
"Dude only took 11 shots and at 35 years of age was BY FAR the best player on a game with future superstars like Zion, BI and Devin Booker.  Sucks that he will most likely end his career without a ring as a major contributor, because the eye test always showed that he was the 3rd greatest PG ever (to Magic and Steph obviously)"

"When people think Derrick Rose was better at his peak or that Devin Booker is currently the best player on the Suns, I am confident he is still underappreciated. Many don’t recognize what he brings to a team."
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B.

"Nate Duncan is a like the Darren Rovell of ""serious basketball analysis."" Dude is just no fun.  Also he rated Danny Green as better than Devin Booker and said DSJ was a better prospect than Booker :)"
1. *Stephen Curry (Golden State) 2. *Luka Dončić (Dallas) 3. Damian Lillard (Portland) 4. Donovan Mitchell (Utah) 5. Devin Booker (Phoenix) 6. Ja Morant (Memphis) 7. Chris Paul (Phoenix) 8.

"Devin Booker has been my favourite player since Dragic days in Phoenix, but maaaaan Chris Paul deserves to be in the All Star game over him. He has been killing it this season."
So you would also say Giannis is a better offensive player than a guy like Devin Booker? Because he averages more points per possession?   Zion is very effective based on his size and athleticism but I wouldn’t say he’s a better offensive player.
"Devin ""Don't call me Devin"" Booker"

There were flashes of superstar-level Devin Booker tonight. His playmaking ability is making leaps and bounds seemingly.
"The scoring of devin booker, the rebounding of Anthony Davis and the passing of doncic   Ladies and gentleman, Julius Randle"
not the current form of Devin Booker man. Anyway if we want to end up with the best record Devin has to start playing to form.
If the Suns end up with the best record in the West Devin Booker has to win MVP right?
No Devin Booker is clearly the best player on their team
Barring some tragic injuries I think the team is more stacked than people realize. Chris Paul alone took the Rockets to a 7 game series and Devin Booker is still improving
"Yes, definitely. But, also Devin Booker was always going to eventually be this good regardless"
Devin Booker
"Same, not a believer in the Suns either. I think Devin Booker and the Suns team are overrated."
"I have seen people unironically putting harden below not only Curry Luka and Dame, but also below Tray Young and Devin Booker.   Anyone I had seen saying so was in the off-season. It's insane how all the anti Harden narrative shapes people's opinions, when there are no games for harden to drop 40 every night."
“Did I leave my stove on... oh shit!” - Devin Booker
I rarely ever see people criticize Devin Booker
Devin Booker
I’d say the 5 seed is a safe bet because there’s the close to inevitable Chris Paul injury (or “injury” for load management purposes) coming in a month where he misses 12-15 games They’ll build out a cushion then come back to earth in the middle to end of February if I had to guess.  If they’re still top 4 in the west after CP3 misses 10+ games then I’ll believe in this team and Devin Booker
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
Devin Booker is easily a front runner for MVP if he takes the Suns from the 10th seed last season to a top 3-4 seed this season.
"[Devin ""Otto Porter"" Booker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwfh_6TG0A)"
people don't seem to realize that I'm just using Draymond's old quote about Devin Booker and just putting his name in there.
It kills me when I see people calling them one of the best NBA pods. I remember Duncan being particularly convinced that Danny Green and Dennis Smith Jr. were better than Devin Booker. Their scouting is just flat out bad.
"Youngest players to achieve 20 pts, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds in a game (in order)  1. Lebron James  2. Tracy mcgrady   3. Kevin Durant  4. *Lamelo Ball*   5. Devin Booker  Not bad company by my standards."
"Hopefully this is the year Devin """"empty stats"""" Booker can finally get the respect he deserves"
This is correct.   But I find it interesting how this sub labeled Devin Booker an empty calorie loser when he scored efficiently seeing a doubled every time up the court with Oubre and a whole lot of teammates at the level or worse than this Warriors squad
The best way to encapsulate the difference between the Suns now and before is now Devin Booker can afford to have an 8 turnover game and not have all the takes after the game of “well does Devin Booker actually help contribute to winning basketball that much??”. Twice so far actually 8 TO games for Booker and Phx still won against a good western conference playoff team
"Generally who knows, but I find it hard to imagine that CP3 would be considered the top player in this team. I think it's most likely Devin Booker will be taking MANY more shots and have the most points per game, and in that case, the second option (at most) will not get MVP attention unless the team has an extremely high record.   The start of the season is very promising, with Suns seemingly having a lot of decent scorers around. With that, I would not bet against CP3 dipping even below 20% usage. He doesn't NEED to score and many players do."
No but they can actually take someone out in the playoffs. CP3 plus Devin Booker is a combination that allows you to be in the  game/series
"Jalen Smith at 10 in last year draft is actually not that big of a reach, he could be a project player that takes a couple years to develop whereas Cam Johnson is older than Devin Booker and got drafted at 11.  Speaking of which, has Jalen Smith gotten any minute?"
"The fact that the Suns are 5-1 and Devin Booker isn't even playing well is a good sign for this teams playoff hopes. I predicted a top 5 seed before the season, and I happily stand by that prediction"
Devin Booker has been such a disappointment this season.
"youre saying murray can help you win a championship better than trae young can. we've never even see playoff trae to know the answer to that. you have devin booker ahead of murray. booker isnt a ""winner"" either, hes in the same lane trae is in. both amazing players but get shit cause ""they never played in the playoffs""."
Devin Booker
"Lmao @ cherry picking 3pt percentage like it’s some random stat 😂   TS% is a crock. It takes into account FT%. In the modern game it’s inflating thr #’s for guys who shoot a lot of free throws and shoot them well. That’s the fly in the ointment that analytics babies haven’t figured out. It’s a scam. A guy can shoot 30% from 3 which is Giannis level, it’s not good at all, just if he shoots 10 FT a game at 80% you think he’s efficient! On paper James Harden is as efficient as Michael Jordan! Lol TS% is broken.   But anyway I digress...Devin Booker ain’t top 15. He might not even be better than Jaylen Brown. Booker just has the name recognition"
"Ight i’ll give it a go..  Devin Booker Trae Young Jaylen Brown Donovan Mitchell Jamal Murray De’Aaron Fox Ja Morant  I think Young &amp; Booker are 1a and 1b honestly, and I like Brown for MIP and All Defensive nods this year."
1. Trae Young  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Devin Booker  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Jamal Murray  6. DeAaron Fox  7. Ja Morant
\- **Trae Young**   \- **Devin Booker**   \- **Jaylen Brown**   \- **Ja Morant**   \- **Donovan Mitchell**   \- **Jamal Murray**   \- **Deaaron Fox**
"Devin Booker, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, Deaaron Fox, Jamal Murray.  Though these guys are so young this list can easily change in one season."
In my opinion:  1 - Devin Booker  2 - Trae Young  3 - Jaylen Brown   4 - Donovan Mitchell   5 - Ja Morant  6 - Jamal Murray  7 - De'Aaron Fox
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
I'm surprised no one brought up Devin Booker.
"Devin ""no playoffs"" booker???? Hahaha yep reasonable take bro"

"Ayton missed half of last year between the suspension/injury, most of the team was ravaged by injuries all year, including Ricky Rubio and Kelly Oubre, and missed the playoffs by half a game. Also, people ignore the fact we added Crowder/Nader/Cam Payne/Etwaun Moore and Langston Galloway to replace a bunch of g-league guys.      The year prior we didn't have a single point guard and we were starting 2 rookies on offense with Igor Kokoshkov at hc. Devin Booker also injured his shooting hand that year and was basically shooting left handed for a while"
"Losing a season at 23, he doesn’t have a ton of miles on his joints. Murray is the same age as Devin Booker, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell. All three are better players at the moment but none have reached their peak yet either. 17-18 season he earned NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to be named All-Defense. Now he’s figuring out his offensive game and this kid could be scary."
The Suns were on an upward trajectory already though  In 19-20 they went 19-63  Last year they went 34-39 and undefeated in the bubble   Devin Booker has also been getting better statistically every year he’s played
"I don't look at Devin Booker as a top-10 player or even top 15 quite frankly I don't think he's going to make any of the guards slots on the all NBA team, and that's not a shot at him that just speaks to the depth of the guard position in today's NBA         Not to mention I think most of the Suns recent impact comes from Chris Paul"
yeah man. Devin booker and tyler johnson
"I agree. There's a couple more players you can bunch into that group of ""over hyped"": Jayson Tatum and Devin Booker. That's not to say that they're bad, but their hype doesn't match reality. ESPN had Jayson Tatum ranked over Jokic as young players you would start your team around."
"Here's a list you could argue for being ahead of him: (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER)  1. Luka 2. LeBron 3. Giannis 4. Steph 5. Jokic 6. Embiid 7. Kawhi 8. Paul George 9. Kyrie 10. Lillard 11. Harden 12. Durant 13. Anthony Davis 14. Beal 15. Gobert 16. Butler 17. Chris Paul 18. Ben Simmons 19. Devin Booker 20. Karl Anthony Towns 21. Zach Lavine  &amp;#x200B;  That's all I could come up with. I think I would personally put Tatum ahead of 3-5 guys on this list, so he'd be in the 15-17 range for me."
"#118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that’s the MVP.   I could even argue the reasoning for his offensive numbers being so good is due to his lack of impact/effort on D. Atleast with Embiid he was doing both offence and defence at a high level so I could see his case. But jokic has no REAL case hence why lebrons ahead of him in almost every MVP race right now except the one that ranks MVP standing on pure stats."
"LOL if I must.   #118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that’s the MVP."
"You lost me on the 2nd half, Devin Booker the guy who hasn't sniffed 30 wins in a season better player than top 5 PG all time CP3 who just carried what was supposed to be the worst team in the league (OKC) to the playoffs and almost upset the Rockets   Who then gets a perennial lottery bound Suns team to what looks like will be home court advantage at minimum   Kawhi is flying under the radar and clips don't get no love, especially after the post season but I thought his name should at least be mentioned, I feel like it would be a crime to not have him in top 5 at least"
Devin Booker isn't close to superstar status.
Devin Booker fo sho
Devin Booker MVP SZN
"Kind of a related but Devin Booker is kind of overrated as a shooter. He's very streaky as a 3pt shooter, some games he's like 6/8 with deep shots and others he's 1/7 but still scores a lot because of his mid-range. For someone so good in the 3pt competition I would have expected him to be close to a 40% shooter."
Point: Russel Westbrook SG: Devin Booker SF: Carmelo Anthony  PF: Domantas Sabonis Center: Nikola Jokic
He’s just making a joke referencing [this](https://kentuckysportsradio.com/nba-cats/draymond-green-on-devin-booker-get-my-man-out-of-phoenix/)
It's also outdated bullshit to think someone taking issue with another player's racism would cost them equity among the NBA fraternity.  Just look at how all the players on the court (including LeBron) reacted to Devin Booker calling the ref a bitch a little while ago.
I feel the same way about Devin Booker. They're both fuccbois

"Not here to overreact, but I think that Devin Booker feller is good."
"Thank you! “Give me guys you lead teams” yet lists Devin Booker who has never made the playoffs, Zach Lavine who has never made the playoffs, and Beal who debatably has never been the best player on a playoff team over Kyrie who was the 2nd best player on a championship team."
Devin Booker is the suns best player  and no one will convince otherwise he started the season struggling a bit but since his return from the injury he has been all nba level
Devin Armani Booker
Devin Booker and Mikal Bridges and others
Devin Booker scored his 100th 30 point game. Most in Suns history. He’s only 24 lol
"Yeah, our comparison for ""whiffing on a pick"" is taking Frank Kaminsky instead of Devin Booker. We'll take Miles Bridges every day."
"Unlikely. Considering where he started, his shooting is the best it could possibly be. His finishing has still been sub-par, he can run PnR but unless it’s with Zion it’s not a *great* idea, and in that case the real threat is Zion not Lonzo. Also in 3 years who of Shai, Luka, Fox, Steph, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, and possibly Dame will he be better than? If he isn’t better then at least 2 he isn’t making an all-star game chief (assuming they all stay in the West, which is a big if but like, still).  In short, the Pelicans are gonna get 29 calls about Lonzo at the trade deadline because he’s THAT good when paired with the right talent. Could he make an all-star team as an injury replacement or something, yeah. But perennial? C’mon now."
except there is a weird comparison because Draymond got fined 50k for saying Devin Booker should leave the suns.
"If it doesn’t mean shit for the team then why does it matter why KD signed? It’s a team sport and if a teams previous years achievement don’t actually mean anything they should be completely justified in signing the best player available so that the next year what they do does actually mean something.   You can’t just move the goalposts and make both statements go against the Warriors. Either 73 wins don’t mean shit and KD was justified in signing or 73 wins makes them one of the best teams in history and KD is a snake for joining. But 73-9 doesn’t mean shit for team but as soon as KD signs is suddenly does because...? He’s good? How the fuck is a teams previous year achievement dictated by what player signs there in the offseason. What?  And Klay and Dray were all star caliber players every single year of our dynasty. We’re not talking about players 5-10 years removed from their primes, they were deserving every year. But they’re only all star caliber players when it comes time to talk shit and complain about the super team but any other time they’re role players. The big difference with Devin Booker being that nobody is talking shit about him being a replacement player, everyone accepts he was deserving of an all star spot the same way Klay and Dray were. However Klay and Dray were talked about as if they weren’t.   And the wording that you use “could” makes it seem like it’s a complicated matter, yet the overwhelmingly popular opinion is that KDs rings don’t count.  None of these point are at all close to being legitimate or criticism for that matter and defending your team when shit gets talked about it isn’t having a victim complex, it’s called being a fan"
"Great OC. Tanking has definitely been lampooned in recent years but it's a (mostly) necessary part of building a competitive team. Even some of the anomalies you listed (without a home-grown top 10) relied on lottery picks they had drafted to create the team that eventually won a championship ('19 Raptors trading DeRozan, '20 Lakers trading for AD). At the end of the day, tanking raises your asset capital and places you in a better position to secure elite talent. It helps if you have an top-tier organization that can scout prospects well and support their early careers, or else you're going to flame out like the Kings have for over a decade. But even dysfunctional or barren organizations can luck into good players by virtue of being in the right place at the right time with draft positioning, like the Suns did with Devin Booker in 2016.  Tanking raises your team's possibilities if executed well over a period of like &lt;5 years, but go any farther than that and you need to seriously re-evaluate every component of your organization."
"Players on different teams can talk all they want directly to each other. Lebron could walk up to Kawhi Leonard, tell him he should leave the Clippers and join the Lakers next year and it would be completely fine.  The only player I remember getting fined for tampering lately is Draymond Green talking about Devin Booker. But that was a tricky situation, he was fined moreso because he did it in his capacity as a TNT analyst."
I don't think he is top 5 but I would give a nod to Devin booker if we are talking about being able to score in many ways at a high level. His left hand is a beauty on drives. He can score at all 3 levels including a mean post up game.
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but this was also true last year except it was Lonzo Ball against Devin Booker. Hit more 3's at a higher rate in less games. That stat could have been just up to the shutdown, don't perfectly recall."

"zach lavine &gt; devin booker. it’s okay to have different opinions, but you cant deny zach is doing things booker has never done. ever"
"IMO, hand checking would see lower scores for a season or two, and then it's go right back to where it was. Guys like Steph or LeBron, who already deal with a lot of physical defense, wouldn't get fazed by it. But guys like Trae or Devin Booker would get fucked."

"If Kyle Korver was an all star then Duncan Robinson has a chance of making one sometime down the line.          For herro, I think his ceiling would be around Bradley Beal/devin booker range, although I don’t think he’ll actually ever end up being that good."
Which moron outside of Utah thinks Donovan Mitchell is better than Devin Booker?
Devin booker with a worse handle but a better 3point shot.
"I think Devin booker is gonna end up in many ways like Carmelo Anthony. He can fill it up with the best of em, but somehow that doesn't translate to any significant accomplishments. So gimme Tatum."
"Tatum, because he seems more agreeable. Devin Booker could be dramatic at times, I’d guess."
&gt;The Heat's organization believe Herro can be Devin Booker.  The heat will be disappointed
"Devin Booker is a pretty decent/good defender now, yeah"
Devin Booker is a pretty decent/good defender now and is one of the purest scorers in the league so I'll take him
"And he's asking for you to give a specific instance, with the Thunder organization, of another player who acted like Reggie did during the whole debacle.  Don't bring out a strawman argument, while referencing Russ ""leading the league in techs"" (11) like that's some metric for his attitude  as a player. In the top 5 spots there's also Draymond Green (9), Dwight Howard (8), Devin Booker (8), and John Wall (7), but none of those players (aside from maybe Draymond) would be considered ""petty"" or argumentative.  Russ has a hot head with certain rivalries (Wall and Dame in particular), but nowhere near as bad as you are portraying it to be."
Robinson: you're pretty much looking at it  Herro: Devin Booker
"I’ve never heard the dwade comparison for herro but I have heard the devin booker comparison/potential thrown around a few times. Like many others have said, I think Robinson is Korver or reddick."
The Heat's organization believe Herro can be Devin Booker.  D-Rob can be one of the best 3pt specialists in the NBA. Not much beyond that.
"Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, and some other players had their ""homes for sale"" a while ago, it doesn't correlate much. I wonder what the actual success rate is for a news story of a player's house being sold and them within the season"

Last year’s suns gotta be up there for the not making playoffs. Devin Booker played out of his mind the entire bubble only for them to fall short. I don’t remember the details but DBook was averaging some crazy stats filled with clutch shots.
"Ok, harden in 2015 was the second highest scorer in the league. Donovan mitchell is 11th this year. You’re committing the same error people make when they compare true shooting percentages across eras. A lot has changed in basketball since warriors mania.   I never said Donovan mitchell will not improve, but there are a lot of players that are also young that are more likely to be the next generation of “super stars.” Luka and giannis are already superstars. Zion already seems more likely to be a super star than mitchell. To name a few others, we got Devin booker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, and then a few more that I really think will be better even though there’s not a lot to go on I.e. lamelo ball and Michael Porter jr. Not to mention there will be more and more players pouring into the league, other guys that improve as well like maybe Anthony Edwards, and some current super stars that are still decently young like Anthony Davis and will be taking up those spots for the next while in Mitchell’s career.   Basically, I don’t really believe mitchell will ever be a borderline top 5 player and I actually believe he’ll probably stay at around 15-20 for most of his career  Edit: ad is actually 28, but there’s others like jokic that are 26 and will be considered better than mitchell for like the next 6 to 8 years probably"
Devin Booker must become a superstar and DeAndre Ayton must become an all-star in order for them to carry the load in the future. Bridges is ridiculously inconsistent
"No, I copy pasted his post below:  Look at past drafts:   2018: Ayton v. SGA 2017: Fultz v. Donovan Mitchell or Bam 2016: Simmons v. Sabonis 2015: KAT v Devin Booker 2014: Wiggins v Jokic 2013: Anthony Bennet v. Giannis 2012: AD v Draymond 2011: Kyrie v Kawhi 2010: John Wall v Paul George  I’d take the 10th pick in 2018, 2017, 2014, 2013, 2011, 2010.   2015 is a wash"

"a rare resighting of Devin ""Despite the Loss"" Booker"
Never forget when SAS proposed a trade of Devin Booker for Kyle Kuzma and MAYBE a first round pick...
"&gt;    Devin Booker  &gt;  PHX - SG  &gt; 36 PTS, 3 REB, 1 AST  &gt;    Kyrie Irving   &gt;  BKN - PG   &gt;  34 PTS, 6 REB, 12 AST  He had 34, 12, 6. Yeah Kai dominated this game."
Devin Booker shook. Kyrie got Kendall Jenner googling how to convert to Islam.
Book. Book. Booker. Devin.
The Devin Booker joakim Noah being doubled in pick up leagues thing
Devin Booker doesn't turn 25 until october.
Devin booker aka Poland spring
"Lebron year, he, Lebron, rondo, and Lonzo all missed near 30 games each. Kuzma missed 12 games and Josh hart more. Our starting center got pneumonia too. It is crazy to say they should have made it regardless lol. You can’t say team had talent and then ignore that the so called talent missed a lot of the season. The team was 4th seed by end of December and had a great win on Christmas Day. Blaming for not winning when they can’t play is a new one.   As for this year, you just have to tune in, the team is just not good enough. It is not about being flawed, the overall roster depends on two guys and the rest are inconsistent. Tonight they missed 15 fts and lost. Blaming individual players for team injuries or bad rosters is stupid. Devin Booker was the biggest victim of this and is now thriving on a good team."
Because the Pistons drafted him. Sometimes it’s that simple. The Detroit franchise drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell in successive drafts. The Pistons draft the wrong guys. It’s what they do.
Players like Devin Booker and Zach Lavine are borderline all stars.  18 and 7 were borderline all star numbers like 10 years ago.
 Devin Booker
devin booker   (this is not slander I’m just guessing)
translation: Devin Booker &gt; Donovan Mitchell
ah the Devin Booker line
we were u underrating devin booker until he started winning. so all kat has to do is start winning and i think he will be alright
"Gobert probably is the MVP of the Jazz this year but there have definitely been a number of national media guys asking why Mitchell was not getting MVP consideration as the best player on the team with the best record. If that same stuff was happening for Jamal Murray or Ben Simmons then that would really hurt the cases for Jokic and Embiid.   You don't hear Kawhi and CP3 getting MVP buzz for this same reason, because Paul George and Devin Booker can make the case that they've been more important to their team's success this year. It might be a minority of people who think that, but it's enough to knock them out of the MVP race. Like I said above, the same thing happened when Steph and KD were teammates.   There's just a big difference between how clear it is that Jokic and Embiid are the MVPs of their teams versus guys like Gobert, Kawhi and CP3 with their teams."
"No. Melvin Booker and his son, Devin, interestingly played against both KG and Kobe in their pro careers"
Devin Booker is the best SG in the league.
"Same reason Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and Rudy Gobert aren't. He isn't good enough. No way MVP can be like the 15th best player"
"My favorite player is LeBron, and I've liked him ever since he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine like 20 years ago. But I would advise you not to be a LeBron stan.  Here's some young and exciting players that I love to watch:   \- **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City** \- Crafty young point guard with an all-around skillset   \- **Lamelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets** \- Great passer and playmaker, and still super young   **- Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies -** Explosive athlete, a point guard who plays above the rim   **- Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings -** Smooth, reliable guard who plays like a veteran  Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Zion Williamson, and Trae Young are all really good and young, but they already get lots of fanfare."
Its been confirmed. Devin Booker cant keep up with the Kardashians.
Because Devin Booker is under contract for much longer and is much younger.
Probably Steph. But for a less obvious choice I really like watching Devin Booker.  My least favorite popular player is Luka. I find his style very boring
TIL only 4 teammates separate Devin Booker and Bill Russell
"It feels to me like when the Raptors clinched a playoff spot for the first time in years, with homecourt advantage, just to face KG, Pierce and Joe Johnson Nets... at least you guys have a veteran and one of the all time greats in CP3 and  Devin Booker is more talented that Derozan or Lowry were, still it feels like that to me. Hope you guy manage to get through."
"2 problems I see with that  1. If a team is genuinely bad, I doubt they would ever win the tournament and just be stuck as a late lottery team for a very long time until they get lucky and find a Zach Lavine or a Devin Booker at 13.  2. Unless the pay day incentive is huge, I doubt most players would be to eager to bring in a 19 year old kid who might take away their minutes, lessen their role, take away their touches, and possibly hurt their next big contract.  The current system isn't perfect but it's fine the way it is"
"Curry was never gonna get open on the last play, they needed to use him as a dummy and find someone else.  Only Devin Booker is getting that call."
"Hey man, we deserve something nice for a change. Think of Devin Booker and the memory of Amar’e Stoudemire getting fucked by the league"
Devin Booker just pee'd a little bit
https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2785943-video-released-of-elevator-fight-involving-tyler-ulis-devin-booker-intervenes.amp.html
Devin Booker as well.
"Wow this is pretty crazy I’m not gonna lie. I think of Sexton as a defender first so the way the stats are presented it’s crazy. But if you look at the talent around A vs the talent around B, it makes sense that his offensive stats are diluted. Examples of that are Devin Booker this year, statistically his stats are down but his team is way better &amp; talented. Another good one is Steph Curry’s numbers with KD vs this season without Klay."
"That is true, however we do have exceptions like devin booker who are considered ones before they make it."
Devin Booker
"I agree there are too many variable which is why I should’ve prefaced this with IMO lol but I will say this. Bradley Beal has played with a player who was just as good as him maybe a little better and at best made it to the semis in the East. AD never had that type of player and made it to the semis in the west. By himself he carried a team to the playoffs in the west twice. Most other seasons he was hurt as well. Beal has never done that and has had the chance. I would also say that ADs teams that he won with weren’t world beaters. So if Brad was on the same level as him he should at the very least carry one bad team to an eighth seed in the East. Listen I think Brad is a great player. But I don’t think he’s a 2nd tier guy which is completely fine. Dude is still a top 20-25 player in the league. He’s on the same level as Murray, Klay, Gobert, Devin Booker, Sabonis, CJ, etc. Those are all star level guys but they aren’t going to drag your team to a playoff spot. In a great system with a better player they can parade as a 2nd tier guy(looking at you CJ). Which is what happened when Wall was there. But even then he wasn’t that consistent and wasn’t the clutch guy they needed him to be."
Zach lavine and Devin booker
"It definitely won't be Unanimous. Too many great seasons from great players. Curry and Lebron will get a couple 1st place votes each. Devin Booker, and Donavan Mitchell will likely get one. Embiid will also grab a handful"
"Lol all 3 of those teams have star power, jazz the least amount but it isn't like Mitchell or Gobert are scrubs either. The suns and Jazz are only in sketchy spots because of potentially having to play the Lakers in the first round.  Oh no, the suns will have to play Chris Paul and Devin Booker more minutes, wow how will they recover lol"
Where was Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton picked at? And how many good seasons did they have before old man Chris Paul had to show up and got them into shape? Dudes teams have 1 good regular season and they get big heads
"Zach Lowe's a fucking hater man. Dude has enjoyed a lot of revenue shitting on the Knicks over the years.  And quite frankly, the only necessary argument for Thibs over Monty is so simple to me, a fucking casual could conclude the same logic;  - Phoenix Suns projected win total, and seeding: ~35 wins, top 8 (lower half) West team  - NY Knicks projected win total, and seeding: ~22 wins, bottom 5 team *league-wide*  CP3, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges?  Before the season, nobody would have dared to compare Julius Randle to *any* of them, let alone anyone else on our squad. Look at our talent comparison on paper? Lmfao please dude, what a joke.  Fuck Zach Lowe, and fuck anyone that seriously considers Monty Williams over Thibs for COTY (excepts Suns fans, cause bias, can't blame em lol)"
this man spelled devin booker´s name deven

I watch the Hawks, and even I didn’t notice how many oops compared to the rest of the league that Trae connects on. There’s a new lob city now!"
Even if it somehow goes to game 7 which is unlikely if the Lakers stay healthy. You’d really take Devin Booker over Lebron fucking James in a game 7? Devins first game 7 against the literal king of game 7s? Good luck with that.
"Going to add this as it's own comment even though I responded to another comment with it in case it gets buried.  Devin Booker is averaging .455 points per touch of the ball this year.  For comparison Beal is .454, Curry is .393.  Trying to track it down, but I'm on my phone which makes it difficult, but I believe either last year or the year before Booker either was first or second in the NBA in points created per possession and touch as well, meaning combining his points and assists.  Booker is an absolute elite playmaker, it's objectively true.  Trying to meld his style of offense with the addition of CP3 has come say the cost of a slight dip in offensive output by Book.  When CP3 is on the floor, the suns points per possession is 1.18.  when Booker is on the floor it's 1.19.  it's clearly very close."

You're correct and Jokic will once again kick their asses but without Murray their guards will be exposed and they got no one to guard both Kawhi and George along with playoff Rondo. You think Austin Rivers/Campazzo is gonna play as well as Murray would've? No way.  If you're going after the Lakers then it makes sense to play them asap cause they are still getting over injuries and need to know to play together and build chemistry. BY round 3 they will be much more dangerous then in round 1.   The Jazz are a hell of alot more scarier then the injured Nugs and the playoff inexperienced Suns (sans CP3).   Then there's the mavs who are now healthy and still remember last years playoffs. You think playoff Luka is not as scary Devin Booker? The bracket they are in now is much more harder then possibly facing the Blazer/Suns/Nugs. Even facing the Lakers early would've been better for them.
"Ah so Kris Middleton is a better scorer than LeBron. Devin Booker as well, CP3 too and don't forget Steve Nash."
What? What does race have to do with this?  Kobe was a very handsome man.   Tony Parker is handsome. Devin Booker is very handsome.

Dillon Brooks and Devin Booker go hard at each other in their games.
devin booker
"It's a PPG thing.  People don't give him credit because he only scores 14 PPG.  Same reason you have people saying Devin Booker, who by advanced stats, is pretty much a net neutral player, saying that he's better than Chris Paul. They only look at PPG."
"I've been saying it for the past few season: Devin Booker is one of the most overrated players in the league, and also has one of the most punchable faces in the league too."
Trae mad disrespected tbh. He is averaging 25 and 9 on a 4th seed hawks team that has been riddled by injuries. He deserves third team IMO over Devin booker
You missed a bunch:  Giannis had 31/13/6/3/1 in G2.  Anthony Davis had 34/10/7/1/3 in G2.  Bradley Beal had 34/4/3/1 in G2.  Deandre Ayton had 22/10/1 on 85% shooting in G2.  Devin Booker had 31/1/3 in G2.  Kawhi had 41/6/4/2 in G2.

They're gonna pay him as long as he's willing to play. Devin Booker will not stick around if they drop back out of the playoff picture
Basically Devin booker bailout free throws to end the game after that 6 mins left ish timeout
How many did Devin Booker have?
That's because Devin Booker is one of the most overrated players in the league. He's the reason the Suns are going to lose to the Lakers.
"&gt;With the game on the line Devin Booker blew it. Not only that, but he was talking mess to AD and LeBron for no reason.   S-o-f-t"
# THREE FREE THROWS FOR DEVIN BOOKER
What about Devin Booker and the Suns lmfao
"Devin Booker shot 17 free throws off some absolutely atrocious calls. AD's last four were intentional, refs were literally gifting Book points at the end"
And the refs are trying to make up for it by giving Devin booker 9 fts in 2 minutes like it matters now
Devin Booker is 17/17 from the stripe and I think about 10 of those have come in the last two minutes
Devin booker has just as many fta as AD
"Devin ""Trae Young"" Booker"
"Devin Booker gets super star calls, but he’s not a superstar?? Just curious"
Devin booker gets every call lmao I didn’t know he got superstar status
Again Devin Booker just standing around watching the game
Devin Booker is a stud don't disrespect my boy.
Schröder has outscored Devin Booker
Devin Booker choking his ass off. No points in the 4th quarter.
Devin Booker is fine.
When you study for cp3 and devin booker but get cam payne on the test
All of this with Devin Booker on the bench
"Payne, the man that can be either Chris Paul or Devin Booker when you need it."
I'll always remember the series Devin Booker first experienced playoff foul bullshit
Tell me you haven't watched Devin Booker without telling me you haven't watched Devin Booker.
Devin Booker is a bad man
"The truth is if Devin Booker isn't going to take it upon himself to lead this team and take over, the Suns won't go anywhere.   He seems afraid of his own potential at times. And no, he's not getting locked up. Each time he touches the ball he isnt looking to create, he just gets rid of it then disappears."
So many people are ready to write off the Suns.   Devin Booker wont let it happen
Devin Booker is negative 16. Lol.
Devin Booker ? More like Devin Bitch
Devin “Grandpa puppet” Booker
Holy Shit Devin Booker.....these Kobe disciples man
The Devin Booker disrespect
I love you guys. Devin Booker is the man!
AD will never be as cute as Devin Booker and I know deep down that hurts him
"A number of reasons over the years    * he has been dominant at every level and gotten a lot of attention for it, leading to getting called ""overrated"" since High School * both in college and early on with the Hawks, Trae was thought of as nothing more than a volume shooter and a ball hog (really both teams were trash and he was just doing what he could to carry those teams) * he plays with a huge ego and deliberately makes plays (like the nutmeg passes stuff) to make opponents look silly, and he has done this since high school * the Luka trade brought comparisons and shade from probably the most fervent single-player fanbase after Lebron since Trae and Luka entered the league * he was an easy target for ""meaningless numbers"" criticisms like what Devin Booker got * lightweight technician who can bait contact and easily sell it because of his size * ""punchable face"" aka people don't like that he's ugly  tl;dr he's good and he plays for someone else's team"
PG - Steve Nash  SG - Devin Booker   SF - Shawn Marion  PF - Charles Barkley   C - Amare Stoudemire   This team would be nasty.
"I agree that we've done pretty well with our picks, especially seeing as they look better and better each year, but I think it's also kind of a curse. The way max contracts work means that Sexton will probably end up costing us basically the same as, like, Devin Booker or Embiid while not being nearly as good. To win in this league you really need a player or two that you're heavily underpaying, whether that's because they're on a rookie contract or because the max limits how much of their true value you have to shell out."
"Trying it right now, right off the top of the head  Dallas: Luka; Denver: Jokic: Houston: Harden: Clippers: Blake Griffin; Lakers: LeBron; Memphis: Ja Morant; Minnesota: KAT; New Orleans: Anthony Davis; OKC: Kevin Durant; Phoenix: Devin Booker; Portland; CJ McCollum; Sacramento: DeMarcus Cousins; Spurs: Tim Duncan; Utah: Donovan Mitchell  Atlanta: Trae Young; Boston: Jayson Tatum; Brooklyn: Kyrie Irving; Charlotte: Gordon Hayward; Chicago: Derrick Rose; Cleveland: LeBron James; Detroit: Ben Gordon; Indiana: CJ Miles; Miami: LeBron James; Milwaukee: Giannis Antetokounmpo; New York: Carmelo Anthiny; Orlando: Mo Bamba; Philadelphia: Ben Simmons; Toronto: Kyle Lowry: Washington: John Wall"
"&gt;Picking one or two instances of things based on narrative doesn’t mean “everything is based on narrative”.  Just because I gave you an example, doesn't mean that there are only one or two instances. The NBA doesn't just give these awards out based on individual play, they give them out based on how important the player was to a contending team. This is why lower seeded players and players that missed the playoffs rarely win MVP awards.   Take a look at Devin Booker for example, dude was balling out for years and should've been considered for All-Star and All-NBA accolades sooner, but it was all considered ""empty stats.""   The simple fact is this; Randle will be considered for those awards for more than just his play on the court. He will be considered for those awards because he was a new addition to and a massive part of the Knicks turnaround from one of the worst teams in the NBA, to a 4th seed."
If we kept that 2018 team + made the correct draft choices:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - Donovan Mitchell - Devin Booker - Tobias Harris - Andre Drummond
"But at the same time Nash has also said in interviews how he thinks players today take too many ill advised three point shots. Nash was the first MVP I saw growing up and his game was a lot more inside out then I think takes like these give credit. I don’t know if Nash would ever hit that high of a three point attempt average just because he was such an adept three level score and he was also one of the smartest players from his era and I think he would certainly hit 5 3PA a game 7 feels a little too high for Nash especially since he had a good feel for the flow of a game and if he went like 0-2 or 3 he would try and attack another way. I actually see a lot of the intellect of Nash’s game in guys like Malcolm Brogdon or Devin Booker, albeit they aren’t necessarily at the level of passer that Nash was. They are hardly ever going to disrupt the flow of their offense for a bad outside shot, they get in and attack the paint and will take what you give them they got spots at all 3 levels where those guys are cash.  He also wasn’t a high-usage guy. In his mvp seasons he had I think 18 and 21% usage rates. I think even if Nash was lacing em up having grown up today he’s too smart of a guy to just jack 3s up at the rates we see guys like Duncan Robinson or Davis Bertans do. I think we’d always wring our hands a little bit asking Nash to shoot more"
"People were crowning him the next Klay Thompson/Devin Booker after the bubble.   Speaking of Rockets fans, a good portion liked the idea of Herro on a rookie deal which we would be able to extend over Ben Simmons, who was already making 30+M in a Harden trade. I was pretty close into buying into the hype (Jaylen Brown was the player I wanted the most).   Herro can still be a great player but it seems like he’s been pretty up and down this year. The next 2-3 years are going to be telling for his career. Will he be a top5-10 SG or just a nice player than is maybe the 3rd best guy on a competitive team."
I wonder how discussions about Devin Booker legacy will go 10 years from now if the best season of his career the best player was clearly an ageing Chris Paul.
I really like the Suns grey shirtseys. That uniform endeared me to a young man named Devin Booker.

I believe that Herro has potential but it was 100% blown out of proportion. I don't think he'll reach Devin Booker status but I think something like a better version of Jordan Clarkson is perfectly achievable for him
"Still there were a ton of Heat fans insisting they would rather have Herro over Harden, saying he was the next Devin Booker and stuff like that."
He *sure* showed that Devin Booker that Kendall should have stayed with him!!! /s
"One fluke playoff run turned Jimmy Butler into a superstar, Bam Adebayo into a top 5 center and Tyler Herro into the next Devin Booker"
NEXT DEVIN BOOKER
“The Heat believe Herro can be better than Devin Booker”
"Lmao ok buddy have fun welcome to the big show, I hope you don’t have an aneurism thinking about Nuggets as you get swept by Devin Booker"
"People heavily underrate iso-style play because it's not as ""efficient""  But the ability to create their own shot is why players like Bradley Beal and Devin Booker so good offensively despite shooting ""average"" from 3 and taking a lot of midrange shots - Fighting double teams and traps for tough buckets is what creates wide open opportunities for teammates"
"Devin Booker has arrived at the playoff ladies and gentlemen, and by the looks of it he does not plan on leaving them any time soon.  P.S. Games with crowd &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"
Devin Booker is highly criticized?!?
CP3 as better Rondo just means we are gonna need Dwade that one year he won with Shaq levels of offense from Devin Booker. You think he’s got it in him?
"Suns in 4, Devin Booker runs LA"
I think he’s saying Trae young is an assassin that loves to fight using deceptive techniques while devin booker calls out his opponents and fights them head on like in ghost of Tsushima. Lol idk that dude’s a nets fan and wants to talk about honor loll
Devin Booker plays with honor though. Trae doesn't.
"Classic feel out game from LeBron, not worried about him at all. LeBron will do LeBron things.  However, I am very much concerned about AD. He doesn't look interested at all and hasn't all season. His midrange isn't falling yet he refuses to move away from it and start posting up and attacking the basket more. Quite frankly, he needs to stop being a baby back bitch and start playing the 5 and being more willing to take contact. Drummond at the 5 isn't gonna get you far.  Devin Booker was AMAZING. Getting to his spots with ease. We've all been wondering what for years what ""Playoff Book"" will look. Safe to say I'm not disappointed.  Deandre Ayton is legit. He was bullying AD on the glass and in the post, at only 22.  CP3's injury is definitely something to watch moving forward. He couldn't control his dribble that well after it, which is highly unusual for him."

Well Trae Young is a noob and Devin Booker is a Pro.
"I hate Chris Paul with passion, but I am rooting for Monty Williams and Devin Booker"
"1. Knicks/Hawks (big play after big play, the teams seemed super evenly-matched, and the crowd was wild. Such a fun game) 2. Bucks/Heat (also a crazy game that was super close and intense, could very well be #1 but was barely edged out) 3. Suns/Lakers (I know it wasn't *as* close but the atmosphere was great and also I like watching Devin Booker play basketball when he isn't playing my team) 4. Jazz/Grizzlies (sorry Jazz fans but it was entertaining and also a huge upset from a very fun young Grizzlies team) 5. Clippers/Mavs (Had some great plays on both sides and it was really close up until the end of the game when the Mavs pulled away) 6. Nuggets/Blazers (I'm biased and the Sixers game was probably a better game but I like it when my team wins) 7. Sixers/Wizards (Fun game as well but it was definitely a morning game) 8. Nets/Celtics (For pretty obvious reasons I think)     Honestly all of the games this weekend were fun to watch"
"Next generation showed out this weekend  Luka Doncic: 31 PTS, 10 REBS, 11 ASTS  Devin Booker: 34 PTS, 7 REBS 8 ASTS  DeAndre Ayton: 21 PTS, 16 REBS  Trae Young: 32 PTS, 7 REBS, 10 ASTS  Dillon Brooks: 31 PTS, 7 REBS, 2 BLKS  Ja Morant: 26 PTS, 4 REBS, 4 ASTS"
"Alright best playoff debut: Devin Booker, Trae Young or Dillon Brooks? Make your choice"
"What a day for Kobe disciples, Trae Young, Devin Booker, and Dillon Brooks."
"Here is how it was for me. LeBron tried to save his team, failed. Right around the time when CP3 re-entered the game, he was not the only one losing handles. Handling and shot making was too loose for the majority of the first half even for the away team.  Drummond surprised me, and showed more efficacy than AD in terms of what is expected out of these players based on their physical looks.  KCP drilled some 3s to make us feel alive but alas, it was all in vain.  Kuzma again scored points equal to his jersey number, a pretty bad showing. Caruso, you tried man, you tried.  Oh and Schröder had a fine attempt at the second half too.   Anybody notice, how the Lakers missed a LOT of free throws? It was incredibly low efficiency, at least from the eye test. There can't be more than a couple of attempts where both times the bull's eye was hit. Saving grace was the blocks I guess. AD had a couple, so did LeBron if my memory serves right.   Devin Booker, you are the man man. Double teamed a ton and did what any smart player would do, pass the ball to someone unoccupied. Oh and Ayton, take a bow big man!"
"To be fair, plenty of NBA fans only watch the playoffs and had never heard of Devin Booker until his first playoff game, which was.... today."
"This is the first time I've ever heard someone refer to Devin Booker as ""Devin"""
Devin Booker is undefeated in the playoffs
TRAESPECT YOUNG 🧊   DEVIN RESPECT-BOOKER ☄️
# DEVIN BOOKER IS THE SECOND BEST PLAYER ON THE COURT IN THIS SERIES
"Man people talk allll the time about sixers missing on Tatum and Bridges, but missing out on Devin Booker is what realllly haunts me at night.  I know we heard rumors of him not working out for certain teams, but still. Team still would have tanked in 16, and 17 then when we get good in 18 mmmph. Simmons, Booker, Roco, Saric, Embiid."
"Yeah, I mean I don't really feel like it takes a genius to understand why Booker doesn't get that kind of love. He doesn't have the history that Tatum has and thats really the end of it.  Who knows, maybe these playoffs start to change that narrative. But nobody ever earns anything in this league by missing the playoffs.   But saying ""less Devin Booker"" is the key to making the Suns better is just a dense take largely designed to fill a specific narrative. If you weren't so intent on trashing the dude, I feel like you'd have taken a step back and pretty simply understood why that makes absolutely no sense at all."
But that’s what I’m trying to say.. this was a post comparing Tatum and Booker. Tatum is quite a bit better then Devin Booker and has more facets to his game. Booker is an amazing scorer but he’s not anywhere near as good as what tatum brings to the Celtics.
Devin Booker and Trae Young my two favorite players now
"Yeah, the Lakers played no defense and the Suns only scored 99 despite having Devin Booker who has scored 70 in a single game by himself. That must be it, the Lakers played NO defense"
"The problem was he couldn't dribble much in the second half. I was getting nervous he was turning into a liability. In the fourth he basically just told Devin Booker to do everything on offense. And then played defense and acted as a decoy, or outlet pass on offense."
I was told Devin Booker wouldn’t be ready for the playoffs
Lebron James: 261st playoff game - 18/7/10 on 6/13 fg.  Anthony Davis: 35th playoff game - 13/7/2 on 5/16 fg.  Devin Booker: 1st playoff game - 34/8/6/1 stl on 13/26 fg.  Deandre Ayton: 1st playoff game - 21/16/0/1 blk on 10/11 fg.
Devin Booker is undefeated in the playoffs.
"So, Devin Booker then?"
Big Dick Devin Booker
Devin Booker has 0 (zero) playoff wins without Jae Crowder
I heard Devin “Despite the Loss” Booker for 5 years leading up to this season
"Devin ""Alpha Centauri"" Booker"
"Tatum is two years younger, and is much better at 22 than Booker was at 22.   Booker spent a couple of years as a guy who shot too much for how efficient he was, and who couldn't play in a team concept - it was The Devin Booker Show as soon as he touched the ball. And a lot of people didn't update their understanding of him as he grew as a player- they haven't noticed how, over the past few years, in addition to improving his efficiency he's drastically improved his ability to operate in a team context.   Most people's opinion of players lags reality by half a season or more, because the truth is that most people just don't watch enough NBA games closely enough to notice slow, steady growth. It takes somebody delivering, repeatedly, usually in the playoffs, for them to change their minds. This happens with improving young players as well as with declining old ones."
DEVIN BOOKER
The over talented Kentucky guard drafted by a team in the midst of an all time cold streak and was pretty overlooked in the draft with an anime haircut and Devin Booker have a lot in common.
"His eFg% went down, his scoring went down, his assists went down from last year. His minutes went up, so you’re telling me the key to making the suns better, was *less* Devin Booker? He’s the same player he’s always been with a little bit better shooting compared to his early years but worse off then last.  You can attribute the suns success this year to the growth of miles bridges on both ends, Chris Paul, and better coaching. Miss me with all of the excuses on why his team couldn’t win more than 25 games a year lol"
"That's a bad take.   For the first three years of his career, Booker was not efficient enough to justify his me-first, high usage style. This isn't surprising - VERY FEW guys who are 19, 20, or 21 are wining players in the NBA. The guys who contribute in a meaningful way to winning at age 20 or 21 are generally all-time greats.   However, like most young players, Devin improved every year. His defense improved. His efficiency improved. His ability to find teammates instead of forcing tough shots improved. So he went from a good-stats/bad-team guy into a guy who is actually making other players better and helping his team win while scoring with high volume and high efficiency.    It happens all the time. A young player comes into the league with holes in their game, and everybody makes their opinion of the player then, and refuses to change it for a while, ignoring the fact that young players improve and there was no reason to think Devin wouldn't improve.   Phoenix got better for a lot of reasons. Chris Paul was obviously an upgrade. Ayton has improved a ton in the past year. The supporting pieces all fit. The team plays with a clear identity and everybody understands their role. But Booker's continued, year-over-year improved is also a big part of why they got better, too - you sub out this Booker for 2018 Booker and the team doesn't make the playoffs."
"Post after Booker has a bad game: ""Devin Booker is a bum. Time to face facts sheeple!""   I love sensationalism and recency bias"
Devin Booker 2021.
Most points in a playoff debut by any Phoenix Suns player by Devin Booker.  Great playoff debut from Booker and shows he can set up in the absence of key players on the Suns.
*Devin Booker
Devin Booker is the best young player in the game and will prove it by going on a Finals run first year in the playoffs.
"I’m late here but goddamn you’re right. I’m not an advocate for *not* talking about debatably the best player ever, but he lost. He’s out. And who is still in? Trae Young, Giannis, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Kawhi, Jokic, KD, Harden, Kyrie....the best and most exciting players mixed with the future of the NBA. Let’s talk about them until we are blue in the face. Oh and the arguably best player in the league right now, Luka."
"Sometimes its less about weather you win or lose but how you play the game. Lebrons talent, his longevity, and his pure star power is absolutely unquestionable. But he's the biggest whiner on the court in the history of the league, Throughout his career he has quit on teams when things aren't going well. And in this recent series he left with 5 minutes left in game 5, and left game 6 without even shaking his son's god fathers hand to congratulate him when its was all over. All of this is after the clowning he and many of his teammate tried to put on the suns in game 3 and then proceeded to not win another game. LeBron deserves all the hate he gets. But just because he gets hate doesn't mean that his game isn't appreciated.  I am old enough that I got to see Jordan play in the 96-97 season and the 97-98 season. I even got to see him play live when he was with the wizards. But I am young enough That I didn't get to experience the rise of Jordan and his career arc. I've gotten to see the whole career arc of lebron from being the chosen 1 in high school to being dethroned by Devin Armani Booker. And its truly been amazing every step of the way.  Both these paragraphs are true. get the Lekluch clients doing cover PR work for lebron out of here. He can be appreciated and legitimately deserve hate at the same time. If he truly didn't want to be hated he wouldn't have gone to such a garbage franchise like the Lakers near the end of his career.   For lakers fans thinking about responding I don't care about how many titles you have, your team still sucks."
"people tend to forget about all the mixed guys like that, like how Jason Kidd lighter skin tone and facial structure makes him look white. people wouldn't realize Devin Booker is half Hispanic because they'd probably just assume he's black and white mixed. once you know, it feels obvious.   even to me as a Hispanic, Tony Romo looks white as shit but he's probably the best Hispanic QB of all time, but you'd never know it. Jason Kidd has an argument for most athletic white player of all time, if he was actually white lmao stuck with that Logic situation forever"
Devin Booker on Kyle Kuzma: “ He destroyed us. That’s what it is. He had a hell of a game. That’s what he does.”
"You have Devin ""Look at him wrong and it's a foul"" Booker and you're complaining about the refs? Yikes.  It took Cam Payne playing like steph to even keep you guys in game 2."
"Devin Booker, Cam Payne, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Chris Paul"

"The bubble was absolutely a fluke, 90% of this sub is Lakers/Lebron/Heat fans so no one will admit it.  A Utah/Milwaukee Finals would cause Adam Silver to announce another 2 expansion teams to make up in advance for how much revenue they’re gonna lose.  Devin Booker &gt; Ja Morant"
"This year really does feel like the changing of the guard in the NBA a little bit, if the Mavs close this out the remaining 8 teams will be led by their stars of:  Donovan Mitchell/Rudy Gobert (never made Finals)  Devin Booker/CP3 (never made Finals)  Nikola Jokic (never made Finals)  Luka Doncic (never made Finals)  Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons (never made Finals)  Giannis (never made Finals)  Trae Young (never made Finals)  and then KD who has won Finals/Harden who's never been  Other than the Nets it's allll fresh blood from a superstars perspective. And same from an organization perspective for the most part. Exciting times!"
"You right, gonna go make a Who You Got Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell thread instead."

*enter Game 6 Devin Booker in a Mavericks uniform
I'll name mine Devin Booker
"Booker does virtually everything better than Mitchell at this point, including defend. Mitch is a better 3pt shooter than Booker, but shooting is still just a function of scoring and Devin is more efficient at that overall, and it's not like defenses close out slower on him behind the arc or something. He's generally been the better passer/playmaker throughout their careers as well.   I honestly don't get why this is a debate, Booker doesn't take it in a landslide or anything but unless you're crediting Mitchell for playing on better teams throughout his career, I don't know how anyone could analyze both their skill sets in a vacuum and not come away with the idea that Book is just a little bit better."
"Do the Lakers win if they swapped Jared Dudley with Devin Booker, Andre Drummond with DeAndre Ayton, and Dennis Schroeder with Chris Paul?"
**Kobe vs Wade** - Kobe  **Duncan vs  Garnett** - Tim Duncan  **Dirk vs  Robinson** - Dirk Nowitizi  Some of my own:   **James Harden vs Kevin Durant**  **Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker vs Bradley Beal**  **Rudy Gobert vs KAT**  **Jimmy Butler vs Kyrie Irving**
"Leave it up to r/nba to twist someone's success into hate for someone else. Jokic is obviously leagues above Towns but that's more telling about Jokic then it is Towns. Also you talked about stat-padding as if that label wasn't thrown at Devin Booker for years and look at what he accomplished now.      You also said ""y'all need to keep jokic out of the same sentence as him."" I've never heard anything about Jokic and KAT being compared this season. Let's not forget Jokic is THE best player in the league this year. This post seems so manufactured and its so random. Lets not use Jokic's historic success as a way to slander other players"
ha totally:  https://lakersdaily.com/devin-booker-takes-cocky-clever-shot-at-dennis-schroder-after-suns-end-lakers-season/  here's the post for the first screenshot: https://www.instagram.com/p/COqMFEVhvGY/?utm_medium=copy_link
I really like watching the Suns play.  Devin Booker is a beast and they play very well together as a team.

"Crowder started dancing, got T’d up. Then Booker walked over to the Laker bench and starting talking trash, and got T’d up as well. Lakers didn’t really even react at all to Crowder dancing, they did approach the court when Booker came over and started talking. You can just Google “Devin Booker ejected” and find video to refresh your memory."
"&gt; Holy shiiiit Lakers fans hate Devin Booker so much lmao  If you think these comments exemplify extreme hatred, you haven't watched the NBA, or been on r/nba long enough."
"Sorry, that's a ridiculous point. ""LeBron should be so good that he can shoot like Devin Booker even with an injury otherwise the game has passed him by despite the fact that he is literally the reigning finals mvp."" So if that's your point I don't know how to help you.  Obviously if he was a better shooter that would help his game. You can say that about every player ever. And LeBron obviously worked at his game over the years and went from a poor shooter to a solid shooter. Anyway, I'm not a LeBron fan but that take needed to be dialled back."
"Lebron played 224 minutes in the series, only Devin Booker played more minutes.  He was gassed and he was never right again after Solomon Hill."
Thank god I don’t hear anyone crying about Monty Williams playing Devin Booker 46 minutes last night
Lebron played 224 minutes in the series.  Only Devin Booker at 24 years old played more. Lol you really trying to take every single quote and turn it into some big indictment.   But yeah Bron supposed to literally make Lakers shoot better than 29% from 3.
It's 100% real I am twelve and I think that if you care about getting back on defense you know nothing about basketball  I also think people believe Devin Booker is the best player in the world  And also I think LeBron hate comes from jealousy that LeBron is the best LeBron in NBA history. Some people got nothing better to do than hate smh  100% serious. No jokes. Basketball talk only 😤
"Lol huh? I didn't say he *couldn't* do it, I like shit-talking ultimately. But Jae acting like he dropped 47 and not Devin Booker. Or acting like he shut down LeBron and AD by himself. Give me a break. He's a role player."
"What does this even mean? He's talking like he dropped 47 and not Devin Booker. He's a good role player but that's his ceiling, so it's entertaining to see him talk so much shit when he's not one of *those* dudes and never has been."
Lebron's giving Devin Booker the Make-A-Wish treatment
"I am not convinced that the Lakers could have won this series with a healthy AD.  They could not stop Devin Booker, which allowed for shooters to get open looks.   Unless AD was guarding Booker, I do not think the Lakers would have won.  Game 1 - AD played the whole game and was a non factor (Suns win)  Game 2 - AD was a huge factor and the Lakers won by only 9 (Lakers win)  Game 3 - AD was a huge factor and Booker had an awful game (Lakers win)  Game 4 - AD was 2-9 from the field before getting hurt (Suns win)  Game 5 - If AD was healthy, the Lakers would have still got blown out (Suns win)  Game 6 - The game was over after the first quarter and even if AD was healthy. Booker took over."
Devin Booker damn well channeled his inner skyfucker yesterday
While we’re here I’m gonna add myself to the list of guys who shoot better than this guy that doesn’t shooter better than Devin Booker
Yeah! Devin Booker getting snubbed for all star picks and not getting the respect he deserves!   All came together at last. Happy for him. 🔥🙏
"Sort of proving my point that you’re an immature internet weirdo lol.  I think Devin Booker and CP3 are great players who I enjoy watching, so sick burn man."
I wonder if Devin Booker had a great showing for that exact reason. To be closer to his succubus.
"No, I get how they can be equal. Devin Booker is the GOAT after all"
Curry was playing against  a superteam with a top 5 player of all time leading it. Lebron was playing against Devin Booker.
Neither is Lebron and their best Devin Booker defender KCP
"&gt;If you get to talk yo shit when you win, you are damn sure gonna eat it when you lose and act like that.  Are you talking about Devin Booker and how he acts when he loses vs when he wins?"
We had a really good defensive gameplan against Booker for a few of the games where we would have Dennis cheat off his man and we would close out the rotations when the pass went out. It gave Devin some discomfort but he navigated through it really well.
"I don't understand why people keep saying this.  Giannis is a 2-time MVP. He's a star.   Luka will make the first team all NBA; Chris Paul is a HOFer and Devin Booker is a rising star that was also a famous NCAA player; Utah is maybe the weakest draw, but they have 3 All-stars so even casual viewers will probably know someone; Jokic is probably this year's MVP so no worries there.  This is going to be a star-studded finals, even more so if Brooklyn gets in instead of the Bucks. And if the Hawks somehow get in it would be nuts - Trae Young is the second Steph Curry to most casual fans."
Devin Booker is my hero
Devin Booker another of Kobe's deciples.
Nah if the Mavs win the whole sub will be a Luka hypefest. Just like the sub was all Devin Booker hive yesterday.
Despite all the salt coming our way watching Devin booker prove all his haters wrong in this series was a joy to watch. CP3 is a dirty ass player but ayton and book are turning into something great. Happy for them to continue to grow. We’ll be back
"For me it was when one of, if not the best player of all time got dominated by Devin Booker in an elimination game on his home floor."
"Chris Paul is the missing piece of the Phoenix Suns this year. All they need is just solid leadership, but they're loaded talent-wise. That monster performance from Devin Booker was something, a redemption from the last year's bubble."
"Devin ""despite the loss"" Booker and Trae ""empty stats"" Young facing off in the finals would be beautiful"
Why the fuck would Booker want an autographed jersey from a man who he just embarrassed in front of the world? Devin Booker is daddy now.
"Devin Booker reminds me of Klay Thompson. Looks like him, has a perfect release like him, and get hot as fuck like him. Crazy that he got 70 in a game once. Dude is a baller"

"Is Devin Booker not a marketable star? He has a pretty game, talks trash, scores heaps"
He did say “guys out there.”  I’ll add myself to the list of guys who aren’t better at shooting 3s than Devin Booker.
"With Chris Paul you are getting not only a player, but also a head coach on the court, which is why I think your claim to be untrue. That and he also nearly matches Devin Booker in efficiency."
Good for Devin Booker. I’ve always been a critic. He put up 70 in a loss and I thought he always needed to be second fiddle to a superstar to succeed.  He proved me wrong by dominating the defending champs and eliminating Lebron from in the first round.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate LeBron James.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 12 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched The King in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into Instagram posts and analyzing body language. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Instagram. The moment somebody brings up ""washed king"" or ""not getting back on defense"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  LeBron's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the greatest SF ever, and one of the best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Devin Booker is better than LeBron, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched LeBron  in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that LeBron is better.  You might be jealous of LeBron's four rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest LeBron in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that LeBron isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Devin Booker The Best Player in the World™, but leave the LeBron talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Been telling people for years, Devin Booker has IT."
"Call me a casual if you have to, but I haven’t seen that many Devin Booker games and I am a converted fan after this series.  Side note: Kendall Jenner needs a GM role on an NBA team"
"""That's not actually Devin Booker"""
Lol fuck off. Devin Booker is the best player on this team and he and his team defeated the reigning champs in 6 games.
Devin booker and cp3 gonna do something steve nash never could.
"You *sure* it's not because they spent the last 4+ years arguing that ~~Russell~~ ~~Lonzo~~ ~~Ingram~~ Caruso contributed more to winning, and just now had to watch Devin 'Empty Stats' Booker himself finish on their chin and bounce them from the playoffs after a half decade of clowning him..? It's just because of that one play, mhmm"
Trae Young and Devin Booker straight up became my favorite young players in the league now because of these playoffs. Love players who talk shit and back it up
"Holy shiiiit Lakers fans hate Devin Booker so much lmao, even Knicks fans have a begrudging respect for Trae but /r/Lakers are some petty mother fuckers"
I'm beginning to think Devin Booker might be really good at basketball.
"IDK about a storyline, that seems crazy overdramatic for me. I understand the Lakers are not your normal 7 seed but it was still the 2 vs 7 matchup without the Lakers' best player (I have mad respect for LeBron but I had to say it).  With that being said...yall hit us with a right hand, put us on the ground, then pissed on us and kept talking shit -- TBH which I'd be mad at if it were any other player than Devin Booker. I've always liked Booker -- he seemed like the quiet type who would always go about his business knowing he was gonna be a star someday but kept his head down and didn't say much, just worked on his craft.  But within these last few years he couldn't handle it anymore, he was fed up trying to do his best Kawhi ""IDC I'm quiet but I'm dope"" impression (which to be fair is probably very difficult to do as a an elite pro athlete) and starting letting people know how good he believes he is. Which I can respect, he always seemed to me like the quiet dude who thought he could always be quiet but is finally realizing embracing his swag might be a good thing for him."
"Right now LeBron is at the parking lot in tears calling Curry. He was sowing the seeds for another super team since the all-star.  Wait for him to thump his chest and self-promote once again that it’s all him once another star joins. Instead of chasing the possibility of being the GOAT, Devin Booker made him his mule today by putting 47."
"FADE US  On the plus side, Devin Booker has arried"
"&gt; YOU SAID THE GAMES AD PLAYED BRUH  AND HE PLAYED IN THAT GMAE, BRUH  Are you trolling?   &gt; No, good lord...I'm responding to ur assertion that AD's presence causes struggles for him. This isn't even reading between the lines it's really just reading  Actually, i said:   &gt; He realllllly struggles to create good looks when teams fixate on him.   I never mentioned AD, you did.   I did say   &gt; lol the lakers that he's been destroying wasn't a number 1 defensive team tho.   and it objectively hasn't been  You think the last two games were even close to being the number one defensive teams?   &gt; First, Book was playing the number 1 D in the league and seeing doubles on most possessions in his first playoff series.   Which happens all time for star players.   And once again, it was mostly shades, not hard doubles when he was making mistakes.   When he was hard doubled, he mostly just made the basic pass to the open shooter.   Really not that tough bro. lol   &gt; Second, with Chris Paul hobbled over half the series...the Suns best ball handler was literally Cam Payne. If Chris Paul actually gets fully back to form...Book can be taken back off ball and do even more damage.  What are you talking about? Devin Booker needs to constantly create shots as playoffs go on because he's their premier shot maker. Devin Booker will HAVE to play more on-ball as teams man mark him off ball.. which will clearly happen if cp3 comes back.   &gt; Second, with Chris Paul hobbled over half the series...the Suns best ball handler was literally Cam Payne. If Chris Paul actually gets fully back to form...Book can be taken back off ball and do even more damage.  Devin Booker was at 1.4 obpm this reg season when he was playing along side CP3. His 58.7% TS/12.4 tov% isn't that great either.   Where are you getting this notion that he's some insane off ball player that can change everything?    &gt; I say all that to say this : this is literally the best defense Book will face in the playoffs...and while I have my reasons why the Suns as a whole will probably struggle... Book is going to annihilate whoever else he plays in the postseason. He's the truth  No wayyyyyyyy. Booker will need to be far more consistent with the ball to really destroy teams consistently.  his defense has been very good tho, but he's too slow and lack the handles RN to be a huge issue for teams."
"one team’s best player has a GOAT case and the other is uhh devin booker? No hate but I would think most NBA fans see Bron on a dif level than Devin Booker but hey, thats just me!"
You’re aware that Lebron has played almost 4 full extra seasons of basketball just in his postseason career. You don’t think a two month offseason had an impact at 36? Devin Booker was in Cancun a full month and a half before Lebron’s season ended last year.
"Did you somehow not watch the game OR look at stats? He absolutely dominated the entire Lakers team. 47 points on 22 fucking shots. 15/22, 8/10 from three, 100% from the line, 11 boards and 3 assists. You are an absolute clown if you can't realize how great of a performance that is, especially against supposedly the best player in the league. Lebron even had plenty of help today. KCP, THT, and Schroeder were all great today.  Let me remind you that this was literally the first ever series for Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton, and they absolutely demolished the defending champs.  Again, miss me with this ""in a couple of weeks shit"". Like I already said, yeah, they very likely will not win it all. When you smugly message me if they get eliminated, it's not going to be a surprise.  All I'm saying is that they have a chance. You're saying it's impossible."
"Ok. Now I’m blocking your dumb ass. But let me leave you with this. The fact that the lakers won game 2 and 3 doesn’t mean they won the series. How I have to explain to you that when we have repeatedly seen teams win down in series JUST THIS VERY WEEK is insane.  You want to suck the Lakers nuts. By all means go at you. You seem to be doing a great job. But, and I really want you to read this, the lakers lost with AD injured AND healthy. Also AD is, as you have brilliantly put it, just 1 player. The lakers are a TEAM. Otherwise they wouldn’t have made it to become a favored 7th seed.  So again, shut your dumb ass up. You have MULTIPLE people in this very tread calling you out for all the stupid shit you are saying. Enjoy that loss. You let the “terrible” devin Booker drop 47 on your ass IN THE STAPLES CENTER. And he sure to whip your mouth after you get done sucking off the team in the locker room. I know it had to be tough for you to type all this hate as you blow AD. Tell him I said to get his ass in shape."
Devin Bucket Booker
Devin Armani Booker
"Unlike the notable MVP candidates in Utah? And not that I agree with it, but CP was literally like fourth in MVP polling like right before the playoffs lol. Devin Booker just put up an all time great playoff performance. And Ayton sonned AD when he actually played. They also have elite role players that rival any other team, and a great coach. You have no idea what you're talking about."
"&gt; U said the games AD played, that's the first 3 games  He played 20 minutes of the fourth, that was way over 50% of what his usual minutes were...Why would you just take off samples?   &gt; Book played poorly in that game...but it had nothing to do with AD obviously because he didn't explode in the second half either  So... you are just ignoring samples?    &gt; I didn't use a ONE game sample size...I used 3. You either can't read or you're being obtuse. I said he played great the first game solid the second and poor the third. This is literally the 3rd time I'm saying this   I'm not sure if you are really understanding this, so let me walk this down. He played in game 4, and he was trash in game 4.   In game 3, he was trash.   In game 2, he was underaverage. How in god's name are you arguing that Devin Booker had a solid game in game 2..Because his ts was great? He turned the ball over 4 times, and because he couldn't run the damn offense, had the worst plus/minus out of the suns. Oh you are right, plus/minus is flawed for one game, let's objectively look at box stats: bpm. Booker had -.9 BPM in game 2. How are you arguing that this was a ""solid"" game?   Even if you REACH, you are wrong.   His average BPM was in the negatives when AD was playing bro.   Just accept he wasn't very good and move on. jesus christ."
Devin Booker is an absolute monster
You are proving my point.  With the ankle injury he needed to shoot like Devin Booker from 3 but he can't.
Media heads will have nothing to talk about? How about a 47 point 8/10 3pfg 15/22 overall fg and 11 rebound effort from Devin Booker to eliminate LeBron James from the Playoffs? And he's just getting started :-) Wait until you see NBA Finals Book ;-)
Devin Booker Shoulder Shake.
Devin Booker?
Sad for my team but happy for Devin Booker. Be legendary
How about we celebrate the team that actually beat the Lakers? Let’s celebrate Devin Booker and the Suns instead of talking about how LeBron isn’t making the finals
"Devin Booker.. crazy.  What's even crazier is that most of his numbers were in the first.  He was pretty average for the other 3 quarters.  CP3 led them in the 4th.  Booker was doubled hard though in the second half, and still made shots."
DEVIN MF BOOKER
The Suns eliminate the Lakers and Devin Booker does it with the manner.  A great performance from a player who is becoming the true leader we were waiting for.
"Shout out to Stephen A Smith for Saying the Lakers should trade Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker straight up. January 14, 2020."
"It's not just you, it's 100% true  Fans are idiots that think that only winning means you are good otherwise empty stats which makes no sense if a player is efficient, the hate Devin Booker, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Beal etc have gotten despite being amazing players recently just shows you   It's a 5v5 game at the end of the day not everyone is a LeBron that can carry a team like that"
"I don't think people are sleeping on KAT, he's just now in the Devin Booker territory from a few years ago. We've seen KAT put up stats for years, but the narrative won't change until he wins in the playoffs, which may not be fair to KAT but that's just how it goes.  I feel like if you swapped Gobert and KAT, both teams would get worse lol"
"“The west was the weakest it’s been in a long time”  We just gonna ignore how great the Jazz, Nuggets and Clippers were prior to the Bubble? Let alone the insane play of Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker and Jamal Murray IN the Bubble?"
Devin Booker is better than Bradley Beal. A healthy Klay is too
Devin Booker he’s a brat
Nah. Bubble doesnt count. Unless you believe Jimmy Butler has proven he can be the best player on a title squad and Tyler Herro is the next Devin Booker.
"Not to take away from the Suns, but Devin Booker got so many calls against the Lakers. If Marc Gasol even stood near him, it was a foul, then Booker would shoot the shot in the confusion and get an and-1."
Fuck the clippers. Fuck devin booker. Fuck the nets just because. And that’s how i ended up “go jazz” lol.   Not gonna bother rooting for any team in the east because i think the nets are going to the finals.
fucking Devin Booker lol?
Devin Booker is in his bag. It’s only a matter of time before he explodes for 50 or 60 piece
Yea Devin Booker has made the playoffs every year of his career right
"Watching Devin Booker, Steph Curry, and Elfrid Peyton highlights 😈😈 that's who I model my game after 💯💯🏀✊🏽🙏🏽  — Tyler Herro"
"Definitely Bron and AD is a super team that's two top 10 guys when healthy. No one can stop AD when he's healthy and aggressive. I don't think PG is good enough to make the Clippers a super team myself. Steph and Klay are a better duo, but Klay is injured.   I think with PG being one of them it's arguable that Devin Booker and Chris Paul is a better duo. In a few years that'll be Booker and Ayton. Jokic and Murray might be right underneath them. Idk, Jokic won MVP. Currently this years stats put George just slightly over Murray by 2 points per game, 2 rebounds, and half an assist.  All in all, I can't call Clippers a super team"
Like devin “2x injury replacement” booker
"Why would every disadvantage not also apply to the Lakers?  And what's your source for your claim that everyone was checked out? *Plenty* of players seemed like the exact opposite, like they were totally locked in. See: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Nikola Jokic, etc  Like it honestly seems like you completely just pulled that out of your ass because one or two players voiced their struggles, no offense"

"Y’all got beat by devin booker and cp3 stfu man🤧, saltiest fan base much"
"Who’s gonna be the next face of the league? I think it’ll be Devin Booker or DMitch.   Both guys appear as family-friendly and are Curry/Wade-like in terms of being fast and scoring a lot. Luka will be the hardcore fans’ favorite. I think Giannis is a bit old and not very successful to be the face. If he was younger, maybe."
devin booker or mitchell?
"Lmao Bron gets sonned by Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton because he ""has nothing left to prove."" Yikes!"
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker have been popping off this post season
"If Suns makes the finals with Devin Booker playing the way he is all the way through, I can see him knocking one of them off. Recency bias is strong."
"NETS ARE BUILDING A WALL, AND DEVIN BOOKER IS PAYING FOR IT!"
"Correct -- but its comparing his defensive value the same as Devin Booker guarding Wesley Matthews.  Booker is probably a better defender than Fournier, but its a lot easier to guard Wes (therefore allowing less points per possession)"
"Whenever I watch, Schroeder seems capable of blowing by literally anyone off the dribble and also seems to be a top tier defender. He was really bothering CP3 in particular and to a lesser extent Devin Booker. He is a worse shooter than Reggie though."
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
"I think the Suns are very similar to the 2018 Rockets, but with much better ball movement and generally better across the board _____ Chris Paul is Chris Paul _____ Devin Booker is James Harden. They have a different play style and Harden is obviously a lot better, but they are the bucket getters _____ Mikal Bridges is a better version of Trevor Ariza ______ Jae Crowder is better than PJ Tucker _____ Ayton is about equal to Capela"
"Wow bro, chill. We can just talk without getting all stressed out lol. You seem like you’re close to calling names here.   My point of nurk and dame still applies. If Melo is standing in the corner while dame scores off a nurk pick, melo’s +- benefits from that. that’s an indication of melo’s impact on the floor. they have to respect melo in the corner, and that’s where melo’s value comes from in that game. Even if he’s not drilling threes for a game, you can’t give him open shots. If for some reason a player is out of position, or blows a defensive assignment, the +- goes down for each player on the entire team. That also makes sense.   So a guy like Devin Booker who runs down and hits a pull-up, then gets put in the basket by Aaron Gordon on the other end, there is no benefit to either team here. So Booker’s plus-minus ought to reflect that.   Again, don’t be rude because +- is best measured per 100 possessions. Pace this year was 99.2, just shy of 100. Doesn’t it stand to reason that If +- per game is not a good indicator of player contribution to winning that game, measuring the stat by per 100 possessions is also a bad measure?   The validity of +- per player is pretty clear because winning basketball doesn’t just consist of points, rebounds and assists. Like those big 3 stats, +- is an indicator of how a player contributes to their team, only in intangible or non-counted, or obscure ways.   Like there’s no stat for “distance primary defender must travel to play help defense on a successful pick and roll in a half court set.” But they do have +-, lol."
"April is not all star numbers and May was half a month which makes the sample size too small to matter much. If you want to combine the months then it looks less significant and not all star numbers like I said. I’m not sure why I’m getting downvoted for saying the obvious, devin booker barely made it when he had significantly better numbers on a top team while consistently doing it for the whole season and the seasons prior"
"He was only the epitome of “empty stats” to nephews like you. Newsflash: empty stats are utter bullshit. They don’t fucking exist. Stats benefit the team. And let’s not forget that Ayton has Devin fucking booker and chris Paul carrying him rn. Trae is leading the team, even if it’s the east. You can’t legitimately tell me the suns would be this good if Ayton was the number one option. Ayton is literally a product of the impact and gravity that booker and Paul draw.  And I’m not triggered, I like the suns. You’re just a fucking idiot lol"
"They also have a hot young stud on each team, devin booker and joe ingles"
"I knew Devin Booker was better at offense that defense, but I didn’t realize how WIDE that gap actually is.   I can legit see this dude scoring 80+ points.  Defensively, it’s like the suns play with 4 players when he’s on the court.   I struggle to remember seeing a player this bad at defense, but who is also a star because of their surreal ability to score.   Maybe harden a few years back, but at least we’ve seen him actually attempt to defend, so we know he can. I haven’t seen Devin Booker play defense yet."
Lol Suns only had 2 All stars because of injury replacement.  Devin Booker has yet to he voted into the All-Star game
&gt;Devin Booker now officially owns LeBron James  This is all I read
"this is one of the kind, its playoff worn and last time he worn the #23, with a personal message to devin booker."
"It kind of is. Devin Booker is playing at least average defense this post season. Whether or not it’s because the guys barking him, he’s doing it. Every single other player in the NBA gets that benefit of the doubt but Book doesn’t?  Those examples don’t prove anything since Trae is on a great team and is still one of the worst in the NBA. His size is what makes him awful. Book is a 6’7 SG"
"Not hating on his performance at all. He’s amazing. I mean that I hate random stat lines like this:  “Lebron is the first person since Wilt Chamberlain to score at least 30 pts, 8 rebounds and 10 assists while having skipped lunch.”  “Devin Booker is the only player in 10 years to average a triple double while also leading his team in minutes.”  It’s like the random goal posts have been defined in a way to isolate that players performance in some way. Just use standard metrics."
"I genuinely love this year's team so fucking much.  In terms of analysis, I was shocked that Malone had no defensive answers. Jokic was lowkey cooking and it did not matter, and that's with the Suns playing bad defense in the first quarter (and were kind of lucky the Nuggets still missed everything).   MASSIVE props to Ayton for picking up two early fouls and then just, not.  He's been so huge in the playoffs I am almost running out of superlatives. He's embodying the archetype of a top ""role player"" center at this point even better than Capella. Watching Warriors fans wishing Wiseman can be like Ayton is so much better than where we thought he was going to be post-suspension. Huge credit to his work ethic AND mental resolve.  Chris Paul and Devin Booker are incredible. Mikal Bridges is finally cooking.   We won with no one scoring 20 two days after 4 guys got 20 points. And it was even easier this time.  Hope MPJ is going to be okay, I would absolutely hate if this means his back issues will be lingering. The Nuggets had a potential homegrown dynasty brewing before Murray went down. Huge respect to both the team and the fans, although I *will* get cocky if we win in less than 6."

"This season has not changed my perception of Devin Booker in the slightest. He was one of the 5 best shooting guards in the league before the Suns were a playoff team, and he's one of the 5 best shooting guards in the league now.   Definitely improved my opinion of Ayton, though. Been impressed by Mikal, too."
He’s injured man. Playing with a stiff back. It’s impossible to move the way he was doing throughout the game. I would still give him props for playing through the pain and stiffness. If only Aaron Gordon hunted for Devin Booker like he did in game 1 every possession Denver would have still lost by 15 points.
And if Devin Booker had F cup breasts I'd be questioning my sexuality.
Devin Booker truly always looks like that.
"Devin Booker actually showed up with a wingspan that was something like 2 inches longer than what everyone expected at the combine. He has a 6'8.25"" wingspan which isn't elite but is solid. Nothing like Tyler Herro's 6'3"" wingspan for example."
"Little do we know Devin Booker is actually really mean, and when LeBron gave him the jersey he told him ""This is mine now, I beat you. There will be no more. Change your number, bitch."""
Devin Booker closeouts are amazing
that's exactly how kendall feels about devin booker.
All time: Steve Nash  Current: Devin Booker
Devin Booker can be an elite secondary playmaker but still struggles as the only playmaker.
"I mean Chris Paul is absolutely running the court at will, Devin Booker is transcending his human form and balling out at a moment's notice, and the supporting cast comes through putting up huge numbers and taking all the pressure off the stars. Nets in 4 by a combined margin of 100 points."
"I mean Chris Paul is absolutely running the court at will, Devin Booker is transcending his human form and balling out at a moment's notice, and the supporting cast comes through putting up huge numbers and taking all the pressure off the stars. Nets in 4."
"He’s sharing the floor with Austin Rivers and Facu Campazzo against Dame, CJ, Chris Paul, and Devin Booker. Those metrics are pretty flawed when you take that into account."
[.](https://giphy.com/gifs/nba-devin-booker-1oFsGPivfGO1ESNcaf)
It always felt like Devin Booker had elite scoring ability but needed a playmaker if he was going to be able to carry a team into the playoffs and then they went and got him one of the best to ever do it. So fun to watch Chris Paul diming guys up all night.
"This was the most disrespectful shit I've seen.  Nuggets need to find some answers man, they're too good to go out sad like this. And I am confident Jokic and Malone can find some.  The Suns are the best passing team in the league but the national media didn't watch them till like game 3 vs the Lakers so it's just not an existing narrative.  This not being the Devin Booker series is so cool. Chris Paul get your fucking flowers mate. And don't forget, 3/100M. You're one of us now."
"Didn’t the Suns become a contender literally this year with the addition of CP3? Going from not making the playoffs to beating the defending champs in round 1. After years of ceiling raiser Devin Booker putting up good numbers and not winning games, I don’t see how that makes him a ceiling raiser. I don’t understand your point at all."
"I first read the post title as ""Devin Booker now officially owns Lebron James""."
"Honest question, is devin booker better than michael jordan?"
"Devin ""Gandhi"" Booker"
Devin Booker. He has a kickable face.
Devin Booker is a baller
Devin baby bean booker
Devin Booker
Ahh yes Defensive First team Devin Booker
"I have no clue why I read this as ""Devin Booker now officially owns LeBron"" I was like ""tf did he buy him or something?"""
Cam Payne and Devin Booker have the dumbest faces I've ever seen.  You asked.  I'm not projecting.
Devin Booker is cool and good
Feel like Devin Booker is the closest thing to Brandon Roy with knees.
Anyone know what shoes Devin Booker is rocking this game?
Devin Booker is so fucking cool
Play hard like Devin Booker
Devin Booker man...
DEVIN BOOKER
Devin Booker signed a 5 year 158 million dollar contract with the Phoenix Suns. He's already rich 🤦‍♂️
"It’s absolutely hilarious they described Barton as just “another body to throw at booker” lol, as if that’s his value for us. It’s because we have 0 shot creators outside of Jokic, it has nothing to do with Devin Booker"
"I stand by the jazz mods kicking out an inbred suns fans. Bro card revoked. Devin Booker is a rat faced whiney boy, that can’t even make an all star game."
"Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are doing what they can to make sure the casuals know their names, too. These two are both superstars, already."
well if Devin Booker ever somehow faces financial troubles I imagine that could pay off a mortgage
I’m going to sleep with devin booker so I can steal it
Why not Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell? Booker in particular has the most star power in the NBA (on Twitch).
Devin Booker ~~owns~~ *owned* lebron~~’s~~ *in his* last game ~~worn~~ *wearing a* jersey in the number 23.
Well Kobe developed his play style on MJ and Devin Booker on Kobe sooo it’s the ciiircle of liiife
So what makes someone dumb in your opinion depends on whether they think Devin Booker and Kobe Bryant are similar basketball players?
Devin Booker owns lebron’s last game worn jersey in the number 23.
He should wear 1 to honor his father Devin Booker
And Devin Booker is good too and he lets Chris Paul ride in his cool cars and Mikal Jail and Salsa Crowder and stuff
The Suns are a basketball team that I support. I like the players on their team. I think the Suns will win because Chris Paul is good at shooty hoops and Devin Booker drives cool cars
"I’d rather have tatum as my teams best player and primary shot creator  But give me giannis with like Devin booker or (god forbid for the sake of the league) luka, and it’s easily him.  I think giannis in a Shaq and Kobe type duo is where he belongs, isn’t creative enough offensively to be the only superstar on a roster imo"
Devin Booker vs Harden as well.  https://youtu.be/OerZS34BUSE
I mean…Devin fucking Booker beat y’all ass
Why the ever loving fuck would you think I'm happy with Lebron after a first round exit where he got outplayed by Devin fucking Booker? Take your Laker hater goggles off.

Devin Booker lookin ass dog
And this sub thinks pg13 is better then Devin booker..
Devin Booker did.
All we need is devin booker
Chris Broussard left Avery Bradley off his ballots for both All-Defense teams in 2017 cause Devin Booker dropped 70 on the Celtics... In a game Avery Bradley missed due to being sick in the hospital.
Avery Bradley not getting an All Defensive vote from 1 guy because Devin Booker scored 70 in a game he didn't play.
"Ayton's defense was pretty overblown predraft imo. Arizona had terrible defense that year, and he was blamed for a lot of that but what people forget is Arizona was also terrible the year before when Ayton wasn't on the team (and a lot of people blamed Lauri for that) when it was the whole team and the scheme. Ayton also didn't get a lot of blocked shots but people didn't realize that he played PF 85% of the time and wasn't asked to rim protect. Ayton was always good at perimeter defense for his size and was actually even Pac-12 all defensive in college. Ayton's reputation as a poor defender lasted during his rookie year because the team was terrible overall including defensively and he was blamed for that when he has Devin Booker and some G leaguer PG starting on his team."
Devin booker for sure. That dudes an elite level scorer.
Lol yeah they’re all going to be gunning for the next Devin Booker prize package.
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they’d take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De’Aaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant"
Globally? No. They aren’t globally recognized. Put Trae Young or Devin Booker next to let’s say Toni Kroos or Bruno Fernandes and ten times as many people would recognize Kroos and Fernandes over them.
Bridges is more efficient? Who woulda thought the guys with a Chris Paul Devin Booker backcourt would be more efficient than the guy on a tanking team.
Depends on your take on whats “good”.   I’d actually have loved to see a world where everyone was healthy and we just wound up with this conference finals.   This will be the year where someone snuck a ring. The playoffs are a good product but it’s not as epic as Bron/Kawhi/KD/Steph going at it. There’s a very real chance we watch Trae Young and Devin Booker throw blows for an NBA title. This ring (and I don’t diminish their efforts in the slightest) is most definitely looking like the healthiest squad is gonna win.
devin booker and trae young killed the narrative  its time we pivot to EMPTY STATS BRANDON INGRAM
"Trae Young and Devin Booker have now posted empty stats in conference finals wins, why is nobody talking about this?? Smh 🤦"
Careful. Devin Booker might get your name and send you tickets to the finals.
The biggest storylines of these playoffs are definitely Devin Booker and Trae Young. I’d love nothing more than to see both of them dual on the biggest stage. Such young players proving they are in the upper echelon of talent at the same time in separate conferences. It’s perfect.

"I think it really depends on where all 3 would team-up. Someone needs to run this through NBA2k and give the results.   There is no way it would be Phoenix because then this scenario includes Devin Booker possibly and the Basketball Gods wouldn’t be that generous to one place.   If the team-up is Atlanta, I can legitimately see that team having a 3-peat or being like the Heatles.   If it’s Dallas, I honestly hate how their team is constructed. It might be visions of a former Houston “superteam” from the 90s with Barkley and Pippen. I think they might make a Conference Finals and flame out after a couple years."
Please give us Trae Young and Devin Booker in the Finals basketball Gods 🙏
&gt;Because periodically he does do sloppy shit and get people hurt.  Case in point: Headbutting Booker and both guys going to the locker room with blood on their faces (and Devin with a busted nose).
"KD has a career series, Trae Young gonna have a career series. If we go through and play Phoenix Devin Booker is going to come out as the undisputed GOAT"
"This is my opinion as well. You don't need to throw away years of basketball just to get good players, you need to draft well regardless of position. 76ers threw away how many years and only really have Embiid and Simmons to show for it (and we know how that pairing has gone). Noel, Okafor, Fultz... All gone. Heck in the draft they took Okafor 3, Devin Booker went 13 to the Suns."
" &gt;Not really, they don't get by Jokic, or any other big time centers if they don't have Ayton.   Damn didn't know that Ayton is the only guy that would allow a team to beat the Nuggets without their second best player. That really does change everything.  &gt;Luka has done a great job putting up big stats, but he hasn't won anything yet  You can't honestly be saying this while arguing for a team with Devin Booker. Do you not see the irony there?   &gt;What Ayton is doing this playoff run is extremely valuable and directly is driving how successful they have been.  Sure, he's still not in the same realm of player that Luka is."
"Definitely. The playoffs earn your spot more than your stats. Devin Booker and Trae young are going to be MVP candidates next season if they perform the way they did this year, because that’s the way it goes."
"Would be an interesting dilemma for them.   I think Green can be a difference-maker, especially in the playoffs, when you need guys who can get you a bucket. Look at Devin Booker. Green’s athleticism and potential to get better at shotmaking makes him my #2 pick, as well. Plus, at #2, I want a star player, and to me, Green is the only guy after Cade that screams “STAR!”  Besides, in a perimeter-oriented league, it feels like you should take the best guard/wing over the big man everytime. (Look at Lamelo vs Wiseman last season)."
"Devin Booker: ""So much death. What can men do against such a reckless virus?""  Chris Paul: ""Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them.""  Devin Booker: ""For death and glory.""  Chris Paul: ""For Phoenix. For your people.""  Devin Booker: ""Yes.....YES! THE HORN OF PHOENIX SUNS ARENA SHALL SOUND IN THE DEEP, ONE LAST TIME!"""
"Rudy gobert = wants to get pushed.  Devin booker = wants to get pushed.   Two amazing basketball plays that definitely aren't soft at all. I figured you would appreciate more gutty, not soft basketball so I showed you that highlight. Hope this helps friend because I'm not sure how much easier I can make it. (By the way the beginning of this is sarcasm just so you aren't confused)"
"We missed out on the greatest Olympic Men’s Basketball team because of the pandemic and injuries. Yes, better than ‘92  LeBron James Anthony Davis  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard Klay Thompson Steph Curry  Dame Lillard  Draymond Green Bam Adebayo  James Harden Chris Paul  Devin Booker"
"While everyone complains that the league is getting sooooo soft, the good 'ole Clippers fans are getting their knickers in a bunch for Devin Booker saying some mean things in response to Beverly's premature celebration. Gotta love it."
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
Who is uninteresting!?!? This has been amazing and I f’n love the hawks team Devin Booker? GTFOH
It’s because this sub is on a major Phoenix high lmao. U could say that Devin Booker is better than prime Lebron and they’d probably still upvote u lol
"Booker was all rookie and dropped 70 points his sophomore year. His team was just as successful as traes has been up to this year.  He's been getting praise from Kobe, LeBron, Durant and other greats his entire career...  Just because you weren't paying attention doesn't mean Devin Booker isn't a star."
A ton of the best scoring two guards entered the league with meh playmaking. That's something they can develop. He's definitely pretty one dimensional but so were guys like Devin Booker
"Stephen A:  DEVIN BOOKER IS BIG TIME, HE'S SPECIAL, HE'S BOX OFFICE, HE'S THE NEXT COMING OF JESUS CHRIST  OP: WHY WON'T THEY TALK ABOUT THE SUNS AND BOOKER IN A POSITIVE LIGHT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  Meanwhile Nike has the NBA fixing games to get Devin Booker in the finals for his upcoming shoe later this year."
"The Suns had to endure a tough past decade ever since Nash and Amare and that core left. They had one semi-good year in 2013-14 where they nearly made the playoffs, but overall they have been woefully mismanaged. But now they have a good coach in Monty Williams, a former superstar in the Point God, CP3, a superstar in Devin Booker, a young and upcoming star in DeAndre Ayton and they are now in the Conference final, 2 wins away from the finals. A Suns Bucks finals is ripe with storylines, and First Take is more interested in Lebron switching his jersey number. This is actually great for parity and the NBA as a whole. Either Giannis, CP3, PG or Trae will win their first championship and it will be great. It just shows that every year manufactured super teams running through the playoffs isnt the best thing for the league. Also fans are back in the stands, and in the Suns and Bucks case, they have phenomenal fans."
"We haven’t gotten him yet. I’m not gonna celebrate till I hear “the pistons select Cade Cunningham” because I’m still nervous about them trading down or doing something funky. But please for the love of god just take Cade!! I just wish D Rose was still with Detroit, he would’ve helped mentor him like CP3 and Devin Booker"
Devin Booker is dating Kendall Jenner so there’s certainly some casual eyes on their team.
Phx isn’t that small market.   You got the 2 time mvp vs Cp3 trying to get there finally.   You got Devin Booker who has scored 70 pts in a game. And should be a very marketable player  You got the “I don’t wanna be here” Sideplot.   The Chris Paul could have been a Buck and the possible regret.   I think the Nba is most fearful of a suns-hawks matchup because both teams had no postseason buildup and it’s literally so new. Usually teams make the playoffs and have a long run before they make the finals.  That being said Trae seems to be pretty marketable.  Plus they are 2 decently sized markets.
"Yes, he's a Kobe/MJ type player. Has that fire, works on his game tirelessly, wants to be great, and has every tool, especially athleticism. Devin Booker is also a good comp. He's kind of a mix of Mitchell/Booker which is crazy."
"Kobe Bryant told Devin Booker to be legendary, and he goes on to eliminate the Lakers by scoring 47 points in Staples Center in game six. I'd say that's a pretty good story about a player on the Suns"
"Ayton being the #1 overall pick over both Trae and Luka making the finals isn’t an interesting storyline for casuals?  Casuals aren’t interested in Devin Booker, the guy who dropped fucking 70 and has several mainstream pop culture references about him?   I get that casual fans aren’t interested in Jae Crowders story or whatever but asserting that a former #1 pick and the dude who dropped 70 aren’t interesting to casuals is just flat out wrong."
"Preach it. I am more excited about the 4 remaining teams than I have been in years. I have absolutely loved this postseason.   So many storylines… nah we will force Lebrons Space Jam and who turned down Team USA down your throats because why would you be interested in Trae Young, Devin Booker, or how the Bucks have stuck together through the embarrassment of the last 2 playoffs and look where they are. You’re interested in what Lebron’s opinion is of players health in this years playoff. Let’s lead with that story."
The Pistons have no Devin Booker or anyone remotely close to as promising. Their current franchise player is a 27-year-old Jerami Grant. They should take the best player available and not think twice.
"It’s because the media hasn’t given any of these guys their due before these conference finals. Maybe Kawhi, but he’s such a low-key guy he doesn’t draw as much attention as LeBron, Curry or Durant.  Like they’ll talk all day about Luka, and obviously he’s very talented and has a bright future, but he hasn’t won anything yet.  Atlanta got kind of disrespected/flew under the radar, as did the Suns this year  It’s just the media likes to create a narrative and now that Nets/Lakers are out, they’re “uninterested” with the results  Suck it, Suns in 4  Chris Paul + Devin Booker/Paul George/Giannis/Trae Young winning their first ring, even Kawhi with 3 rings on 3 teams if Clippers win, is one of the best outcomes this year could have had as a fan of basketball"
&gt; no one on the Suns is an exciting player  Devin Booker??? I guess a 40 point triple double isn't exciting
"Here was my take. I made a post just like this a few hours ago. I don't know if this will help, but it's a start.  1.) **If a player has possession of the ball** (like devin booker dribbling) and someone knocks the ball out, they have to review it in real time. They can review it as many time as they need to get it correct, but it has to be in real time. If it's inconclusive, stick with the call.      2.) **If no one has possession of the ball** and for example, the ball is loose and getting deflected off players , they can go ahead and review it in slo mo.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't worry, some of these people haven't actually touched a basketball in their lives, but want to argue against it.  You're good bro."
"You can't hold a ball the way a waiter holds a plate. That's a carry and is relevant to the discussion. Even taking your example at face value, the conclusion you're drawing just isn't true. It's also silly to say ""It's just physics"". The play between Devin Booker &amp; Pat Beverly isn't common, it happens because Beverly gets the ball from the bottom while book is dribbling down. Booker ends up loosing control."
"Suns are up 2-0 on the clips with no CP3 and Devin Booker playing with a broken nose.  IDGAF tho if you wanna call it a Mickey Mouse ring go ahead, I'll totally care about your thoughts at the championship parade"
&gt;They have Devin Booker who many compare to a modern day Kobe  Nah
"""The media"" are businesses.  They cover what people want to be covered because that's how they generate money.  If covering MLS got espn the same amount of interest as the NFL they'd cover the MLS. If their viewers would watch as much about Devin booker as they would LeBron James they'd cover Devin booker. The mainstream isn't going to cater to diehards.  Stop crying about it"
"Devin booker broke his nose during last nights game and helped his team win, Steve Nash did the same, MJ had the “flu game.” There are over 80 games a season you won’t always be 100% it’s an explanation but not an excuse to his terrible field goal % or his inability to move from his spot. If he was worse then his replacement he shouldn’t have played. But he ain’t, even at 50% he should be better but he didn’t play to his true level. Or share the rock, just bricked them."
"Jordan passed to Kerr from the wing on a designed play to get things moving first. Devin booker passed off Jae Crowder(who you 100% don’t want taking that shot) who then turned in to Mikal Bridges. Who has been anything but good shooting the ball from 3 lately.   I’m not saying he shouldn’t have passed the ball. I’m saying more should’ve been done previous to that. Deandre Ayton and Cam Johnson(who actually had the hotter shooting hand) go far side as booker comes to collect the ball. He slowly dribbles up, double teamed roughly 30 feet from the hoop. He flips the pass to Jae crowder the inbounded. Who then kicks a pass to the corner to a guy who’s been ice cold for the series and last 5 games.    You compare it to jordan and Kerr. But that was a designed play with lots of movement going on. There was absolutely zero movement on this one. And the suns got lucky that somehow the shorter guy going for the rebound knocked it out of bounds. Because if it goes off Ayton, that’s game, or if Ayton cleanly gets it where he’s at, he would’ve had less than two seconds to gather and put it back up.   But I think you missed my point. It’s not that he passed. Every legend has a big time game winning assist. But it’s that there was nothing smooth about that play. And booker didn’t even pass it to bridges anyways. Booker kicked it to Jae Crowder, the last man you want shooting when you absolutely need a bucket."
That was the year before (she just told about it last year). The only Sun left from that team is Devin Booker
No shit no one is saying Jaylen Brown is Devin Booker lol read my comment again that’s one of the dumbest trades I’ve ever seen in my life
Jaylen Brown as in the same dude who was putting up almost Devin Booker type numbers in the regular season.....literally had a career year for y’all lol
"&gt; Always making the playoffs with low-mid 30 wins  Idk why people keep saying this, we've made the playoffs exactly twice since Dwight - last year and the year before. Everyone acts like we've been the 8th seed for a decade. It's bizzare. Even before the bubble playoffs (so literally ONE playoff appearance) people were saying the same thing...  The other years we didn't just miss out of the playoffs either, we were straight bad (bottom 5 every year except 2016 (11th, still bad) and the playoff appearances) and then unlucky with draft slots and terrible trades by the previous FO. If you look at our drafts since Dwight, we've always moved down or stayed put and just out of reach of franchise talent.  https://i.redd.it/ncc5bvz3rx671.jpg  * 2013 - Oladipo (good pick but bad trade by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job)  * 2014 - AG - we miss out on Embiid by one pick because we move down in the draft.  * 2015 - Mario - we miss out on Porzingis by one pick * 2016 - Pick becomes Sabonis, but traded by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job * 2017 - Jonathan Isaac - good pick, but we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Fox) by one slot, again because we move down * 2018 -  Bamba - we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Trae) by one slot, again because we move down * 2019 - Chuma - Great pick * 2020 - Cole - Good pick * 2021 - We probably take Kuminga, missing out on the perimeter scorer we desperately need (Green/Suggs/Cade) by one slot, because we move down...again.  It's silly to try and say retrospectively they should have drafted a Devin Booker (13th pick) or an MPJ (14th pick) or SGA (11th pick) with a 5th pick. We've simply been unlucky and haven't had any franchise talent simply fall into our laps like some of these other teams. The trades made by the previous FO deserve the criticsm and Hennigan should have been canned much earlier, but it is what it is."
Everyone missed Boogie’s two handed shove of Devin Booker too. Could have been another 10 minutes with them reviewing player interaction and technical fouls after that play.
"After review of the play, technical foul assessed on Devin booker."
"Luka took the Clippers (who had a healthy Kawhi) to a game 7 when his co-star was Porzingis who scored like 10 ppg through the series. If his co-star was Devin Booker, that would be a huge upgrade"
Yes for the delicious Devin Booker flavored tea
Ain't no one gonna talk about that Devin Booker Flop?
Imagine thinking CP3 and Devin Booker are likable.
What about the intentional foul resulted in injuries. Look at what Patrick Beverly done to Devin Booker. And Giannis also stopped ended the championship of Nets with his move.
"Kendall Jenner traded Ben Simmons for Devin Booker, can someone get her a GM job?"
"Average emcees is like a TV blooper, MF DOOM, he’s like Devin Booker"
It was clear the Clippers entire defensive focus was on Devin Booker this game. Payne took advantage of that.
My first thought was Devin Booker so I’m glad to see him at least as a mention.
"Watch the play again. Based on how Phoenix is set up there’s only 2 guys who could realistically break to the corner. Either Cam Johnson who starts closest to the corner, or Devin Booker who would get there on some type of action. Bridges is far off ball and Ayton you wouldn’t care if he took a long shot. So watch PG guarding Johnson and Batum guarding Booker    1. PG’s back is turned to crowder. His feet are literally dug in and his hands in Cam’s chest . He is 100% defending agaisnt the immediate pass to that corner. There’s nothing there   2. Part of the reason Ayton got free is Batum is positioned to trail Booker and he, too, is also facing with this back completely to crowder which again means he is defending agaisnt Booker breaking toward the ball. There is no play there. They had the short passes covered. Which left the  lob. Cousins needed to shade to cover the line of site for the lob—-correction, the coach should have told him to do so."
I love a cock Devin Booker.
"I get the CP3 narrative, but he wasn’t the guy who changed everything about the team and the organization, he was the perfect final piece.  The Bubble Suns weren’t a fluke. If Ayton hadn’t missed 30 games for injury and his drug fuckup, the Suns would have been in the playoffs.  Monty Williams is an excellent coach and leader. James Jones is a hell of a GM. Robert Sarver didn’t fuck it up yet. Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton are a rock solid foundation.  Chris Paul is an incredible player and an incredible leader. He deserves a ton of credit. But he alone didn’t change a “trash organization.” He was the right guy for the right time."
They need Booker in the finals to sell his upcoming shoe after these playoffs and Olympics.  That is the reality of the situation.  You can bet money by the end of the year there is a Nike Devin Booker shoe.
Show me on the doll where Devin Booker hurt you
Devin booker is always a bitch. How quick people forget that he shoved Schroeder mid air when they were losing. Sore winner and sore loser
"Should Luka not be confident? Should Devin Booker not been confident? These are professional athletes so I don’t understand why they shouldn’t be confident to be 1 in a million to have a job in which only 450 people in the world fill the position a year. It shouldn’t be a prerequisite someone has to make a Finals, also people are still holding onto a quote he made in jest at a practice 4 years ago, it’s pathetic."
Devin Booker is and has always been a brat
"I think Devin Booker saw it, and might have mentioned it to the people around him. Also it looked like the security staff saw it."
Devin Booker just did what James Harden never could. He won WCF games with Chris Paul out. Why is nobody talking about this?
Devin Booker: 9/9 FT tonight
I'm gonna put an opinion- if Ayton is what healthy Greg Oden would've been. This man's a joy to watch. Then you pair it up with possibly one of the best guard in the NBA in Devin Booker- sweet mercy this is a solid team.  Wait till Point God comes back.
"Insane screen by Devin Booker, he really toughed it out the whole game have a lot of respect for him after this one"
Disfigured Devin Booker gimmick when
OHHHH-OHHHH THERE GOES DEVIN BOOKER
I can’t believe Devin Booker doesn’t know how misunderstood Cousins is. Wildcat on Wildcat crime.
The moment the announcers don't even acknowledge something happened you know the fix is in.  Stephen A said Devin Booker is the next coming of Kobe.  They need Booker in the finals to sell his upcoming shoe after these playoffs.
"But that absolutely should not be the point. The point is that the outcome of the call is dependent on challenges &amp; review.  Let's pretend you're holding a ball like a waiter is holding a plate, and i come and slap the ball out of your hand, who's the ball out on?  In real time, it's out on me. In slo-mo, it's out on you, Same thing applies here with Devin booker &amp; Pat beverly."
"This is the best example on how i can explain this:  ""Let's pretend you're holding a ball like a waiter is holding a plate, and i come and slap the ball out of your hand, who's the ball out on?   In real time, it's out on me. In slo-mo, it's out on you, Same thing applies here with Devin booker &amp; Pat beverly"""
"&gt;Pretty much this.. here's the best way for me to explain this   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Let's pretend you're holding a ball like a waiter is holding a plate, and i come and slap the ball out of your hand, who's the ball out on?   &gt;   &gt;In real time, it's out on me. In slo-mo, it's out on you, Same thing applies here with Devin booker &amp; Pat beverly"
"Unfortunately, but you can't fault Luka for not having the supporting cast of Devin Booker and Chris Paul. I would pay lots of money to see how far that team could go."
"They're absolutely calling it differently.   Let's pretend you're holding a ball like a waiter is holding a plate, and i come and slap the ball out of your hand, who's the ball out on?   In real time, it's out on me. In slo-mo, it's out on you, Same thing applies here with Devin booker &amp; Pat beverly"
"Gg Suns fans, I can’t even be mad at pg for missing those free throws, dudes just exhausted and those felt like pure ball don’t lie(plus the second one he almost bounced back to himself which would of been a fun dumb way to end a game).   Gg Suns. I hate Devin Booker now but for the good reasons to hate an opposing player. Like the fact that he’s a punk ass. Makes these games fun."
"Devin ""literally Kobe"" Armani Booker"
“Did you see the screen I was setting”  -Devin Booker
"The Booker out of bounds play is *technically* correct, but imo it's bad that the rules are the way they are. Pat Bev clearly hit the ball out of his hand, the problem is Devin still was making contact with the ball after the poke. They should revise the rule to say that in the case where one player has clear possession of the ball, a poke out of bounds by a defender should always be off the defender unless a part of the body of the offense other than the hand of the offensive player in possession of the ball makes contact with the ball after the poke."
So are we gonna ignore DeMarcus Cousins pushing Devin Booker after Ayton's dunk?
Devin Booker the unsung hero on that last play. Totally got Ayton free enough to get the slam
Devin Booker looking average tonight. But he gave the Suns what they needed to win in the last second.
"Devin booker averages 26.1ppg Jayson Tatum averages 23.6ppg Devin booker has a 48.7 fg% Jayson Tatum has a 44.8 fg% Devin booker has a 36.0 3p% Jayson Tatum has a 39.8 3p% Devin booker's ft% is 91.6% to Tatum's 80.6%. ... Booker the better shooter, but Tatum has the bigger offensive package"

Devin Booker about to do some king shit

Devin ‘Owen Wilson’ Booker. Jokes but he’s showed his toughness.
Fast forward. It’s 2030. The suns have won 8 out of 10 championships. Devin booker has no nose and goes by Voldemort
devin booker gonna be looking like mr burns by the end of this series
Devin Booker will never be able to smell the fact that he’s filthy stinking rich again
"Devin ""Voldemort"" Booker"
Devin booker is a worse flopper then Chris Paul
A Trae Young-Devin Booker matchup in the Finals is the last thing bill simmons wants to see lmao
Respect Devin Booker.
"It has genuinely been a joy watching Devin Booker. He is simply that dude. Hits shots he probably shouldn’t, wants to go at you. Go book."
Me: Dunks on Booker   Me: *fuck yeah!!! Shoulda stayed in the library!!!*  Devin: what  Me: cuz books. Library?
Devin Booker JACKED lmao JVG
DEVIN BOOKER IS THAT MAN
If the Devin Booker and the sun's win you wouldn't put Booker above Luca until further notice
"Devin Booker so inexperienced he's never even played in a game 7, it's not just dbook winning games the whole suns team is solid - same with the jazz."
i want the devin booker kill shot game
"Booker continues to be unable to guard literal Reggie Jackson   Devin ""next Kobe"" Booker, as Suns fans call him"
Devin booker is consistently getting cooked on defense how tf did people compare him to kobe???
Devin Booker was better on D this season but he is getting fucking toasted this series.
Devin booker got crossed by pat bev lmaoo
I like Devin Booker as well
Devin Booker is not settling for jumpers today.
Devin Booker is the only franchise player remaining with fully functioning arms and legs
"&gt; They aren't doing anything to avoid injuries better  Teams can absolutely do this..... the Spurs implemented ""load management"" before anyone else and it paid off by helping Duncan, Parker, and Manu last longer. That's just one example and doesn't even begin to take into account differences in nutrition and rest protocol, among others things, that vary between teams.  &gt;and it'll be that way if the Suns win too.  Are we gonna pretend that Chris Paul didn't contract Covid and that Devin Booker broke his nose and has worn a mask the last few games?"
CP3 and Devin Booker are too busy looking for their shots that they forget to feed Ayton. If they forget again they will lose. This is where Monty needs to take over because CP3 and Booker have no problem doing what they've been doing.
So who's the 2021 NBA Playoffs Curse going to claim this game? Suns better hope nothing really bad happens to Devin Booker tonight
Also Devin Booker literally broke his nose. People are acting like the Suns haven't had their fair share of problems too.
Yeah sure against like Devin Booker not Embiid lol he'd put him in the basket
Devin Booker was a good stats bad team guy and where is he now?  He’s critical to a team competing in the WCF.  Good stats on high efficiency - don’t downgrade him just for being on a bad team.  Herro is a bad stats ok team guy lol
"The Clippers aren't holding tight to Saric on the perimeter, they're happy to live &amp; die with him shooting jumpers.  Cousins is bad, but he gave the Clippers a real spark in game 5 when he got to go against Saric.  If you want spacing around Booker &amp; CP3, then going with Cam Johnson at the 5 is a better bet.  The real issue for the Suns in game 5 wasn't Ayton, it was that Devin Booker is playing through an incredibly painful broken nose and that CP3 was way too happy to try &amp; iso for mid-range Js.  You have to credit the Clipper defense for that, but they're dogging Booker &amp; CP3 regardless of who else is out there with them."
"  Lol, is Devin booker doing well"
im glad boogie is getting his respect. he was shit on sooo much unnecessarily a la devin booker
Devin Booker
"didn't seem like Ayton needed a 3-pointer when the Suns were cruising through 4 games and he was putting up 20/13 through the first 4 games.  Perhaps the problem is that CP3 took a bunch of shitty isos in game 5, Marcus Morris hit a bunch of mid-range fades, PG-13 hit a bunch of really tough Js with a hand in his face and Pat Bev head-butted Devin Booker, broke his nose and now he hasn't been the same since?"
This kid has a deeper voice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lAHKitHVyU  Damion Lee and Devin Booker need to switch voices
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
It's near Calabassas.  It's to stalk Devin Booker and Kendall Jenner.
Devin Booker is a better basketball player than Anthony Davis.
"Thank you homie, people keep just glossing over the fact that the Suns had the 2nd best record in the league. They were a top 10 offense and defense team. It wasn't a fluke, they're good. You can acknowledge that they're a good team and also acknowledge that injuries have created an easier path through the playoffs. On top of that, Chris Paul got hurt in game 1 against the Lakers, then he got covid, and Devin Booker broke his nose. All of these things can be talked about at once, but fuck nuance right"
"Devin Booker has been a shell of himself since Beverley broke his nose, and that has hurt the Suns in both ends of the floor and nobody is mentioning it.  Booker is healthy, the Suns are in the Finals since Monday."
"Crazy, maybe that’s the exact reason we played the defending champs in the first round as a 2 seed. I love how all of you NBA Twitter fucks never seem to comprehend that. The Lakers weren’t a normal 7 seed, but AD missing 2 games and Lebron not being 100% made them a lot closer to that... even though you’re brain dead if you take the 2021 Celtics or either 7 seed last year over this hurt Lakers team (Dinwiddie Nets and Blazers).   I mean we are at the exact same point the Celtics have gotten to in the past decade, that’s just a factually true statement. Y’all started off in a much better shape, had the trade of the decade, and yet your success isn’t greater than the Suns with Devin Booker. Tough to hear, isn’t it? 3 conference finals, never won a 4th game.... tough. You thought you’d be on the rebuild... with Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, and Al Horford? Or was that with just Kemba and Gordon? 3 allstar level players, Tatum, Brown, and Smart... still couldn’t make it past the ecf. Like I said, tough lmao"
"Best player in the finals might really be Devin Booker, no disrespect to him but damn"
"The healthiest team that has also had Chris Paul injured ten minutes into their first series, he gets healthy again only to get COVID despite being vaccinated, Devin Booker has a broken nose, and Cam Payne hurts his ankle 4 minutes into game three.   Luckier than other teams that none have been season-ending injuries but definitely going through their own stuff."
"And… why is that a problem? The Hawks have won their first two ECF games in franchise history, one of which with a heavily home-grown rotation of underrated guys. The Bucks have another guy who was an all-star last year in Middleton, and a guy everyone said was gonna put them over the top in Jrue. Paul George is silencing a lot of the ‘Playoff P’ memers. Devin Booker is playing the most important basketball of his life, and Ayton’s showing that he shouldn’t be an afterthought in the 2018 draft conversations. There’s plenty of narrative here if you’re interested in something beyond “here’s the same guy who made the finals six years in a row do it again, wow #greatness”"
"Booker has been much better than Chris Paul in this series, not saying he's been nearly good enough but if Chris Paul was performing at Booker's level this series would be over already.   Chris Paul is shooting 32/13/94  Devin Booker is shooting 38/32/91  Also, for the first four games, Devin's defense was fine, they had been switching him onto PG and he had been doing a good enough job. The last game was bad because Morris took advantage of the size but I don't think Devin played bad defense on him. My issue with Booker's defense last game was in off-ball situations, he needs to lock in and be much better there tonight."
"maybe this season can at least provide an example of why valuing wins so highly for an individual player is fucking stupid.  go hawks and suns they deserve it, but them winning shouldnt affect your opinion of devin booker"
lol you are so mad on every thread about devin booker. u aight
"Top 10 player conversations are so weird especially with so many aging or legacy superstars on the list.  They didn't get it done this year but it's their rosters fault. Still top 10.  But the other players left off the list getting it done don't deserve credit for whatever reason?   At what point to we live in the moment and say this year Trae Young, Devin Booker and PG have elevated their game and deserve to be rated top ten if only for this year. No doubt they have been electric this year and playoffs more so than quite a few names on that list."
No. I'll remember it as the season Trae Young proved all the haters wrong.  No. I'll remember it as the season PG13 proved all the haters wrong.  No. I'll remember it as the season Devin Booker/CP3 proved all the haters wrong.  No. I'll remember it as the season ~~Giannis~~ Middleton proved all the haters wrong.  At least one of these gotta be right right
"But I was told Devin Booker was already the greatest player in the NBA by Suns fans, robbed of MVP/DPOY and a top 5 player of all time."
What a game.  Bridges with the field goal at the buzzer.  Devin booker goes 34/46 with 326 yards passing 2 touchdowns 1 interception
"This was my first thought as well.   A few of the most prominent injuries that come to mind of late were just the result of random happenstance. Pace probably isn't going to result in LeBron *not* getting dived into, it's not going to prevent that awkward drive in the half-court that resulted in Giannis getting hit, it's not going to prevent Trae from stepping back onto an official's foot, and it's probably not going to prevent Patrick Beverley and Devin Booker from bumping heads.   But on the other hand, there's another category ripe with candidates as well; those who sustained muscle tears, contact-less ligament-based trauma, and whatever else may fit. I think *those* could kick-start a discussion on overuse and perhaps pace, types of movements, etc. I just have too little knowledge of this year's injury specifics to know where to start."
"If Trae doesn't come back or the Hawks lose:  FMVP might be Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Deandre Ayton, Paul George.  Never would have expected those candidates, George is the best player there but we never thought he had a chance at it due to Kawhi being there and now gone."
"CP3 had the shoulder for about two games. Devin Booker broke his face. Cam Payne had an ankle injury. They just might healthier but they are not healthy. I think that's the theme of these playoffs, injuries."
"&gt;this now leaves Paul George, Devin Booker, and Chris Paul as the last 3 all stars left in the 2021 playoffs  wow... that's depressing as hell"
It's higher than what Devin Booker shoots from 3
But Paul George isn’t on that level either.  Nobody has him as a top ten player in the league.  Before the playoffs people were putting guys like Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker above him.  I think Bill Simmons had him ranked between 20-25.  Weird that he’s held to a top 10 standard when nobody thinks he belongs anywhere near the top 10.
It’s more annoying than anything like do it for Devin booker or Chris Paul
"Nah, 0% chance the Suns lose this series. Devin Booker is the best player in the world right now, it won't matter if Kawhi Leonard comes back they are losing in 6 either way."
[SomeAsshole] Rip Hamilton says Devin Booker says Clint Capela called him about wearing a mask in game 5.
Has r/nba found their new overly loved role player in Kevin “Better than Devin Booker” Huerter?
"Poor Devin Booker isn't out here playing with his nose hanging off for mfers to be calling the Suns ""healthy"""
Devin booker is a poor mans jr smith
Devin booker is a superstar. Hasn’t been the same since his nose but I’d still say he’s one
"The Jordan rules was only a pistons thing, and the Jordan rules were if you fouled don’t let him get the and 1. And it was for 2 seasons. It wasn’t his whole career. And mugged?  Devin Booker and PG went through more last night"
"I didn’t say play like MJ. I said move off the ball. Those pockets are still there.  Those shots are still there.  Someone like Giannis gets in those pockets and isn’t skilled enough to make those shots. Steph gets in those pockets and scores so much off the ball with floaters and lay ups.  For PG’s offense to be purely isolation and spot up 3’s, there’s easier points for him.  Devin Booker as well. Like I said it’s not single out PG, and it’s not play like Jordan, it’s move off the ball."
"Two top 5 players get more traction/hate than Devin Booker, absolutely fucking shocking 😱"
"Think about players that have elite skills by modern day standards. Simmons is an elite defender, Zion has an elite second jump and finishing skills, Devin Booker is an elite scorer with decent 3 pt shooting, Westbrook is an elite dunker and offensive rebounder    Michael had all these skills paired with the athleticism of a player like Gerald Green and a psychotic will to improve continuously and win."
"Not necessary a NBA unpopular opinion, more of a r/nba one.  Devin Booker is highly overrated on here, he is a solid role player, nothing more."
"""Devin Booker is a terrible defender because he gave up a couple baskets inside to a 6'9"" PF"" is interesting logic."
"Can't even hope to compare to? Devin Booker is one of the best players in the league with the ball in his hands? He'll never be the passer Trae is, but to say he doesn't have an elite on ball presence is laughable."
"Unfortunately, Chris Paul is not a great 2nd option for a championship contender. Devin Booker also isn't a great 1st option for a championship contender at this point until he develops his handles and offensive repertoire more. Then you got Ayton who plays too soft for some reason at times and Mikal Bridges who's nowhere to be found on offense.  The postseason is all about half-court offense, and I thought the Suns were good at that, but the problem is that Chris Paul is not good enough to beat great playoff defenses that are athletic and can switch. He only had his great series in the 2nd round for a reason...because he could feast on bigs and slow wings all day. Now, he's got a lot more athletic and aggressive defenders on him.  The Suns have to figure out what they can get for Chris Paul in the offseason. I would not sign him to a huge contract if he limits your ceiling this much (can't imagine how badly he would struggle against the Bucks, Nets, or Sixers). He's just not worth 2nd-option-star money."
Top 10 Active Players Remaining:  1) Giannis  2) Paul George  3) Devin Booker  4) Trae Young  5) DeAndre Ayton  6) Khris Middleton  7) Jrue Holiday  8) Chris Paul  9) Reggie Jackson  10) John Collins
I completely agree and that’s essentially the gist of my post. Great players but I feel they’re overrated and the general discourse around them always makes them seem greater than they truly are. In CP3’s case primarily  (greater than the team). For gods sake I was seeing articles printed out titled “Devin Booker saw cp3 was injured so he decided to play like him” after his 40 point triple double. Then you have media and blog ppl crediting cp3 for games he didn’t even play
"The Suns are the least likable team left in the playoffs. Watching solo PG try and lead a Kawhi-less Clippers to the finals after years of slander is exciting, Giannis is primed to make his first finals and show everyone just how dominant he can truly be, and The Hawks are playing wayyy above their weight class. On top of this, Chris Paul can be snakey and Devin Booker is a hothead. The Suns aren’t unlikable, they’re just the least likable of the remaining contenders"
"half of this sub just doesn't like basketball and treats this sport as a vessel to spew negativity.  I guess we like Paul George now? Devin Booker isn't bad now? Doc Rivers is literally Hitler now. Don't even get me started on Ben Simmons.   Just fucking have fun, watch basketball and enjoy it."
I don’t know Embiid doesn’t look psychological broken. Devin Booker lost for years seems to be doing fine.
"They aren’t on the court though which is what matters..anyone can offer advice From the sidelines, let’s say devin booker and bill Russell are great friends do you include Bills experience as well?"
Reporter: how was the energy on the Clippers bench??  Me: the energy was amazing the atmosphere was unreal &amp; I just wanna say  WERE GONNA FU** DEVIN BOOKER  IN THE Pu***Y
Lmao one of the stupidest comments I’ve ever seen. Refs were sucking Phoenix dick all night. You couldn’t get near devin booker without a foul being called
"as much as i love devin booker, he's terrible at defense. he has potential with his physique but not very skilled and borderline lazy with it. he needs to step it up in game 6 smh   idk shit about trae tho."
"That’s an argument that just lacks any understanding of basketball. If Ayton is just getting spoonfed baskets, what is it that Cam Payne and Devin Booker are doing that other teams can’t replicate??? I mean Ayton’s averaging 20 on insane percentages when cp3 is hurt or out of the game.   Rudy Gobert has 5 20+ point playoff games in his career out of 43 games. Ayton has 6 20+ point playoff games in his 15 games and is averaging over 18 a game in the wcf."
"I was listening to ESPN radio for most of the Suns game last night and the way that Doris Burke just drools over everything the Clippers do and then doesn’t give any kind of positive energy towards anything that the Suns did pissed me off. I don’t want to listen to you be biased as fuck for 3 hours, I just want to know who is shooting shots or blocking etc etc, not how good do you think this bench man is vs how Devin Booker taking a contested 3 is a bad shot."
"Devin Booker is so bad. Streaky is appropriate, but his hot streaks are so far and few between and very short lived"

Devin Booker hasn’t had a good game since game 1. The clippers probably take a sigh of relief every time him or Chris Paul have the ball.
"you don’t, but you do see sam jones doing the pull up jumpers you’ll see from like a devin booker"
If Devin booker has time for a pump fake plus dribbling  then Ayton has time to pass the ball
"Hes been the best player on the floor all series still cant believe I saw people say Devin ""traffic cone on defense"" Booker was better than him lmfao"
Reporter: how was the energy on the clippers bench??  Me: the energy was amazing the atmosphere was unreal &amp; I just wanna say   WERE GONNA FU** DEVIN BOOKER IN THE Pu***Y
"Pat gets the attention he does because of the players he's injured. Devin Booker (broken nose), Jeff Green (shoulder contusion), and Russell Westbrook (torn meniscus). He might not be trying to injure people but he's also not trying to avoid injuring them.  He makes high risk plays because at worst for him he gets a flagrant 2 and he's out. He might injure someone but that's the role he's created for himself in the league"
"Devin Booker is the definition of a front runner, dude goes WWE when shit ain't going his way."
"Harden and Kyrie are role players you heard it here folks.   Your take is real bad mate. Like you should think about how teams have more then one star, a role player is a facilitator for the whole team but isn’t high in stats. Pippen 100% is not a role player   Role players to you  Lakers Shaq   Any of Lebrons teammates (Bosh, AD, Kyrie, now Melo+)  Devin booker behind CP3"
Devin Booker is black? I really had no idea
"That's Olympic Gold Medalist Devin Armani Booker to you, ya no talent 🤗"
"*Devin Booker filmed beating up a dude.*  r/nba: he’s just young, he’s maturing, he’s still my guy  *Rudy Gobert filmed crying when thinking of his mom*  r/nba: LOL WHAT A BABY BISMACK BAGUETTE AMIRITE"
Devin Booker in game 6 of NBA Finals punching the air rn
"On a 1 to total fuckboi, Luka is about equal with Devin Booker, and is closing on Ben Simmons at a rate of knots."
"Oh yeah, typical third stringers Damian Lillard, Devin Booker, and Kevin Durant. Dudes who barely can see the floor in the NBA. You this ignorant?"
Devin Booker must feel somewhat vindicated
"Can someone explain to me why the action in the Olympics looks so different than in an NBA game? Is it the lack of fans? Or because they don’t regularly play with each other? Or am I just imagining it?   I just felt like Dame and Devin Booker looked like nobodys compared to when they’re in the NBA and seem to dominate. KD seemed to be so heads and shoulders above them, whereas when they play against each other in the NBA I feel like the talent gap is much closer."
"I understand the thought, but I think it's gotta be tough, recruiting wise. Like what are you going to do, refuse Devin Booker because you could get a guy like De'Andre Hunter or PJ Tucker?  Team USA has a hard enough time getting its stars to play as it is. Might get worse if you start refusing offensive stars in the league because of fit."
"Stock Up:  1.) Holiday: Dude provided the US with lockdown defense, playmaking ability and some clutch scoring.  2.) Tatum: Looks like he will take over as the best pure scorer in the league next year.  3.) Luka Doncic: 48 point bomb and didn't play the full game and 1 REB away from a triple double in another game.     Stock Down:   1.) Bradley: Dude was so bad he was kicked off the team  2.) Dame: Dude was just as bad and should've been cut from the team as well.  3.) Devin Booker: 0/4 FG in the final game for gold. Dude sucks in the biggest moments."
Bogus stat that no one tracks:  Devin Booker scored the winning point (#83) with 1:58 to play in the 4th.
"I find it wild that these aren’t even the best US players. If Ad, Lebron, Curry, Harden, CP3, Klay etc decided to go, half these guys would even “qualify.”  Imagine being as good as Devin Booker and still not making the cut."
Devin Booker gonna fuck around and make it a close game at the end for no reason.
devin booker hate club assemble
Devin Booker has been utter useless. Get him out of the game permanently
Devin Booker and Dame turning out to not be better than international stars is something.
I keep thinking Devin Booker is Seth Curry.
Devin Booker isn’t conceding ground and is holding his own defensively. Olympics are a magical place
Devin “Seth Curry” Booker needs to be subbed out of the game for a perimeter defender

Devin Booker is a superstar and a generational talent
James Harden and Devin Booker would go look for new jobs
"Really you mean the jae crowder, devin booker, Chris Paul suns? Or the James “mr flop” harden nets? These two fan bases are complaining about players bitching to the refs?  Classic"
"The Devin Booker no call foul in the finals was the worst I can ever remember seeing as he was their only offense at the time, but nba refs bailed him out"
It's very rare the Jazz don't sniff the playoffs just have a hard time staying competitive when we get there. I agree Rudy fits the system better because we do play with a defense first mentality but often times good defense isn't enough. Mitchell is an outstanding player I don't really understand this narrative but to each his own. Also Books and Spidas stats are very close and comparable so I wouldn't consider him a downgrade Books has an edge on defense Spidas a bit higher % from behind the arc. Also less TOs.  https://franchisesports.co.uk/donovan-mitchell-vs-devin-booker-comparison-2021/
"&gt;What do you mean you take injuries into account? That's like you saying klay was a top 20 player this season. It makes no sense. That's like saying durant was top 5 player in 2020. If you get injured, that matters. We're not talking about hypotheticals where everyone is healthy, we're talking about what actually happened.  there's a difference between being injured and not playing entire season and being injured and playing through said injury in the playoffs. cmon let's not do this. We don't have to agree on Curry being the best.      &gt;Also how can someone be the best player in the world and not make the playoffs? If you don't make the playoffs, how do we compare your playoff performance to someone who did make the playoffs. We have to guess what you would have done, which isn't fair. Once agin we are not talking hypotheticals, we are talking about what actually happened. Saying Curry is the best player in the world right now is wrong, you're literally only using the regular season as evidence.  because we're comparing people and not teams?? Curry the player was great, the Warriors the team were not. I don't why you're so adamant about this point. Was KG not a top 5 player when his teams were missing the playoffs? Is Devin Booker better than Curry this year? Where do we draw the line."
It's just like the dumb Devin Booker and Trae Young empty stats garbage like usual.
Deserved All Star over Mike Conley and Devin Booker last year at the time of voting.
I was at that game with a date who was among the crowd of Utahns who wanted to see Jimmer real bad. I instead watched Devin Booker drop 59 points and try his absolute damnedest to give Jimmer just one bucket in that final quarter and walked away a huge Booker fan and an equally huge Jimmer hater.
...And devin booker had Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul on his team lmao
so is devin booker a losing player ?
devin booker literally had the same issue until the bubble lol we’ve had dogshit players around zach with dogshit coaching.
Now she's with Devin Booker so it looks like it worked out.
People say this without realizing players like Devin Booker are fighting to be in the 15-20 range.
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"
"Devin has always been on the spotlight tho. This was Randel's first taste of that. But to your point, and I love Julez, Devin Booker is Devin Booker."
Devin Booker.
He almost killed Devin Booker tho
Devin booker had his first time in the playoffs too
"I see a Ben Simmons thread, i downvote  Dude isn’t worth discussing and has **zero power** and Devin Booker cucked him"
"Trae or Harden drawing a foul by making an unnatural motion to draw contact? They’re cheating and cheapening the game of basketball. Luka drawing a foul by making an unnatural motion to draw contact? High basketball IQ, willing to do what it takes to help his team win.   Devin Booker complaining to the refs on 3 straight possessions? Annoying little bitch who can’t win games without the help of the refs. Luka complaining to the refs on 10 straight possessions, plus in the postgame presser? Highly competitive guy, cares about winning, just has a general passion for the game"
"""Devin Booker once complained about double teams, and then had a turnover in a double team"" is by far the stupidest post I've ever seen on r/NBA. Nephew Everest."
All Devin Booker
Devin Booker.
KD has been amazing but these takes are getting absurd. Draymond and Jrue are definitely giving effort on defense. Devin Booker has been off and on but after settling into Tokyo seems to hitting his rhythm. Book has also been a solid defender and has come up with multiple big steals. I mean tonight the team was cold from 3 for a quarter and the Australians were shooting at a ridiculous clip of like 13/17 to start and got a ton of early foul calls. As soon as both of those things started to lean back to average the US came back and was up 20 before you could blink.
well devin booker leaves this club next season i imagine
“Mostly iso guys and we're about to add Devin Booker and Khris Middleton lmao. Jesus help us.”
i love seeing team mates javale mcgee and devin booker
Devin Booker
Devin Booker +30 😳
Devin Booker was good defensively all season long.
"Devin Booker has brought me so much joy since he got to the league. Balled tf out defensively tonight, so proud of my dad"
Apparently this Devin Booker guy is good at basketball
feels like nobody has raised their stock higher in the last 6 months than devin booker
My unbiased opinion is Devin Booker is gas
did you miss devin fuckin booker of all people locking up your skinny guards lol  and lavine dunking all over your ass
Devin Booker taking his anger at the Finals out on poor Australia
Not a regular on this sub. He is a good player. He might even be a great guy. But does Devin Booker have a reputation for having a super punchable face?
Two straight game-swinging third quarters from Devin Booker. He's up to a game-high +24 after being a game-high +22 in the win over Spain.
DEVIN MF BOOKER
Shoutout Devin Booker man.
Devin “neutral court GOAT” Booker going HAM
That was some of the best 2 way basketball I’ve ever seen Devin Booker player. Very patriotic 🇺🇸
#DEVIN BOOKER.  That is all.
Devin Booker letting freedom ring 👀
Devin Booker.
Yup that's a Devin Booker And 1
"GOD DAMN, DEVIN BOOKER."
Devin Booker is a role player without NBA Refs.
"We really boutta lose to patty mills and company. God damn. A team with KD, devin booker, etc. Horrible coaching or what is it?"
Paschall is five days younger than Devin Booker lmao. People acting like he's a 20 year old prospect are just deluding themselves.
"Devin Booker: 40 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 fouls"
"Look, I haven’t been arguing that the Mavericks are a top 5 or even top 10 team. I’ve said that one of their players had a great series against his opponent in the clippers. If winning is really the only thing that matters (which you seem to believe, correct me if I’m wrong), then by that logic Trae Young and Devin Booker are better than Joel Embid and Lebrun James."
Eric Paschall is the same age as Devin Booker and Chris Duarte.
"No one saying he was 2015 lebron. Im just saying book actually showed up and played pretty well given the circumstances, he wasn't a dissapointment like you say. Was he incredibly efficient no, but he certainly did his job and got buckets. Phoenix could have won game 4 Devin booker was keeping them in that game all alone, Chris Paul was no where to be found. Game 5 Book balls out again, again chris paul no where to be found until he hits some 3s in the fourth quarter that make his efficiency box score look good but he was no where to be found the first 3 quarters. That was the turning point in the series."
The saddest part of those years is when we missed the playoffs that first year and got the 11th pick I was hoping so bad the Pacers would take Devin Booker. Myles Turner is a nice player but I think most people would agree Booker is the better piece overall
smh except it's not actually a nebulous concept for anyone who has looked at synergy data.    holy shit no one seriously guards devin booker or joel embiid beyond the 3 point line.  Devin booker wasn't even top 50 in true shooting last year.    I'm done with this.  Mia runs Robinson off screens all game and the defense has to account for him constantly- it creates countless opportunities for other teammates.  those other guards you listed are also elite shooters and defenders never leave them alone... and they make a TON more money than Robinson does.
DeAndre Ayton is 17 but he still buys beer and cigarettes for Devin Booker when he forgets his ID.
"I'm not ignorant nor arrogant you're literally assigning rankings to a completely nebulous concept called basketball ""gravity"" and using one single tweet to prove your point. But because I watch basketball and you don't, I can name 5 players just off the top of my head that NBA teams would never not guard before they would not guard Duncan Robinson. Kyrie Irving, Keving Durant, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Joel Embid, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Lebron James ...oh wait that's more than 5."
"Kind of a weird name.   Would be like Booker deciding calling himself ""9/11 Devin"""
"Yah I like those line-ups a lot for you guys, I'm a biiiig Fox fan, I really think he's at that Devin Booker pre-2020 level where he's undervalued by most fans because he's not on a winning team, but the second his team gets some success people will realize how elite they are.   No room/hope for Bagley even in the second unit?"
"Devin Booker went from underrated to overrated. PG, Tatum,  Beal are better. Also where is Ingram and Zion?"
"We paid a lot, but seeing how much we added and how we didn’t lose anything that was in the long term plans, we’re super happy. AKME ain’t crazy. All the contracts thus far are shorter deals, so should things not work out we’ll have a ton of cap space and all our picks for 2024 free agency. That year KAT, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, and Devin Booker are all free agents. Chicago will have money to offer max contracts."
"Devin Booker, Trae Young, etc"
"Timberwolves are in the West, D'Lo is good but he ain't that nice to be a consistent All-Star in the West  Devin Booker barely got into those 2 All-Star selections and he puts up better stats than D'Lo"
"It’s so weird and frustrating to me that he can’t seem to break through to that level. Lightning quick athlete who can really shoot from deep, and seems to be a smart player, incredibly easy to support and root for, but not a superstar.    I really like him and hope we can get to winning with him, but he just seems to not really have a switch that he can flip and go and take over in winnable games. And I’m not talking about the final few possessions or something. More like the last 5~ minutes where you’re either making a final push to catch up or trying to maintain a lead. I feel like that’s where things got ugly for the Bulls in a lot of games this year.   Zach can get incredibly hot and win games with his ludicrous offensive output, but from what I’ve seen of him, he just isn’t great at going and getting a couple of buckets in close games. He valiantly tries, but it feels like he usually ends up taking a contested or off balance shot from mid-range or 3 that rarely goes in during those moments. The type of shot that you just feel your body disagree with the moment you realize he’s not pump-faking anymore and just lets it fly.  The ability to slow down, control, and take over a game on your own in crunch time is IMO, probably the most crucial attribute to be deemed a superstar in the NBA. Devin Booker, Trae Young, and Luka are all young players that I’ve seen to possess that ability. I feel like you have this confidence when watching them operate in close games, where you know that they’re going to get value out of their possessions. They’re just in control.  I’m more than open to hearing why I’m wrong, as I definitely didn’t watch every Bulls game this season, but I have watched a lot of Zach being the first option for the Bulls, and these are my objective reactions/observations about his game. He’s still a really talented offensive player who can average 25, but I want him to do that in a way that’s conducive to winning a lot of basketball games."
"I feel there are a lot of budding superstars that would definetely take center stage once the great ones retire.   Obviously Zion, Jason Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Trae Young are just a few names that come to mind."
"Larry ""Skywalker"" Nance Sr. and Jr. are both pretty nice  Mychal Thompson and Klay Thompson vs. the Curries in a shootout?  Rick Barry and all 3 Barry boys (Bones was probably the best)   Henry and Mike Bibby, though I think they still hate each other  Mike Dunleavy Sr. and Jr. would somehow finesse you out of every penny  Doc Rivers and Austin Rivers would probably call bullshit fouls  Fun fact: Melvin Booker and Devin Booker BOTH played against Kevin Garnett and Kobe. Imagine your pops giving you tips on guarding Kobe."
"Are you looking at the average for the league...or by position..? It doesn't make sense to lump the power forwards and centers in there. Amongst guards he's actually better than guys like Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Drose, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Westbrook"
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
"Honestly depends on how you define superstar. If Devin Booker is a superstar, so is Zach LaVine. If superstar means top five in the world, then obviously neither of them are current contenders."
"Three Suns players should be watched carefully this upcoming season. Devin Booker is going to have hardly any time off after playing into the Finals and then right into the Olympics before getting back to work for next year (training camps start in about 7 weeks). Jae Crowder will be playing his second consecutive season on extremely short rest after making the Finals in back to back years, each with the shortest off-seasons ever. And of course Chris Paul, who has never gone deep into the playoffs at all so he's always had a long off-season, and now will be playing on extremely limited rest.   I think Phoenix could have a lot of problems this year."
It only took people one season of success to switch the tone on Devin Booker after calling him an empty stats/calorie type player.   Same thing will happen w/Lavine if this season is a success--it's crazy that he came back from that ACL injury and his improved literally every season in his career so far.
"Any 38 year old would be embarrassed by Devin ""Devin Booker"" Booker"
Devin Booker played in every game
"It's all fairly irrelevant, right? He had 21 points, 6 assists and 6 rebounds in the Heat's regular season finale.   That says more about his NBA standing than does a national team game (or many). It's not like anyone is worried about Devin Booker because he's shooting poorly in Japan."
They're quite often starter or star level players at 13-15.  **13th pick over last 10 years:**  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Zach Levine  Kelly Olynik  Markief Morris  **14th pick over last 10 years:**  Michael Porter  Bam Adebayo  TJ Warren  Marcus Morris  **15th pick over last 10 years:**  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Kelly Oubre   And that's ignoring a bunch of guys who have had long careers off the bench.
Bill is still my go to for entertaining basketball discussion but my issue with the dude is that his ego won’t let admit he was ever wrong with his takes. I.e Devin Booker and Trae Young as two recent examples.   I’d appreciate him more with a bit of humility but that’s not his style.
This man watched 6 Devin Booker games and thinks he has him all figured out lmao  Bet you think you could guard him too huh?
"My point is that even if you think the duck is having an objectively worse day, the subjective suffering is just as real to Devin Booker as it is to the duck.  Hedonic treadmill zeroes out pleasure like a kitchen scale"
Well Devin Booker knows if he backs down then he would get a lot of backlash
"“All star” is not a much better way to determine worth. Would he have been an all star in the west? Is he still at that level? Does he have even more potential? Work ethic?                                                            Tbh, I haven’t heard much on Vucevic. I’ve heard a lot on Devin Booker. My understanding the past few years is that Booker has a versatile skill set - he’s good at attacking with either hand, midrange, and threes. Some people worry/worried that he’s a chucker. Vucevic is more of a skilled big man though right? Kinda like Bam, Lopez, etc?"
Cam Johnson is older than Devin Booker
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
Chauffer with sign at airport: NBA Champs...and Devin Booker
"yeah man. I wanted to tank but people can't act like tanking has helped anybody but the Suns all that much. I'm sorry Kings and Wolves fans, but I'm pretty content as it is. Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, and Donovan Mitchell were late lottery picks. it's not the worst thing in the world.   all we have to do is let DeMar go and we're gonna go from the 12 pick to top 7 almost unless someone takes a big step which would be what we want anyway. lol"
We're on a pretty good streak right now.   One reporter asked if JaVale McGee's mom was alive.  Another asked Josh Giddey if he pooped.   And just a few days ago a third asked Devin Booker how frustrated he was about losing... on behalf of Chris Paul.   Can't wait to see what's next.
"I feel Trae has more impact on the game.  The separation seems to be creative playmaking.  Booker isn’t on the same tier as Trae in terms of passing, and facilitating.  Trae’s a poor defender, but Devin isn’t the greatest in the world."
Trade PJ Tucker for Anthony Davis and convince Chris Paul and Devin Booker to take the hardest road and sign vet mins for bench depth
The quickest to come to mind is Devin Booker and Sebastian Telfair obviously on kind of different points of the spectrum.   Marvin William's going 2nd in 2005 while coming off the bench at UNC kind of ruined bench lottery guys for me so that kind of fair right?
"I love when wins become player stats. He was on the fucking Orlando magic. He is the sole good thing we had going for us over the past decade. It isnt empty stats we just suck, I thought this whole empty stats shit would die with Devin fucking Booker being in the finals but I guess not"
Did you not see how many touch fouls they called for devin booker like geeez devin initiates the contact and it’s a foul. Also he is such a complainer every drive he’s talking with the ref
"Did you not see the part where I said it was for Small Ball lineups? Simmons and Embiid could work together if they had better shot creators and shooters. Until Morey made his moves they didn’t have enough shooting or ball handlers to make Simmons and Embiid work. Even without Simmons in the playoffs Philly got embarrassed by Boston because they didn’t have a guy who could enter the ball into the post to Embiid. You put Simmons on Phoenix with Devin Booker, Bridges, Ayton, Saric, Cam, Payne and more 3 and D wings and they could totally make it work. Simmons at the 5 against small ball lineups would be like what Draymond does for Golden State. You can’t trap Booker because Simmons is a great playmaker and he can push the ball in transition like Draymond. On defense his versatility allows you to make all kinds of lineups and he can hide other players on D as well."
So Russ/Dame aren’t an honorable mention but Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are
Devin Booker for Donavan Mitchell
Trae Young for Devin Booker
I was at a game once and they were chanting MVP for Devin Booker and I was thinking how crazy it would be if he heard me specifically and we locked eyes and he came into the stands and kissed me haha
"Yeah you don’t know hoops  Middleton is a wing not a 2 guard and he’s not mediocre on defense. He’s above average and taller so you can trust him switching on to guards and forwards   Sixers have one good perimeter defender besides Simmons and he fouls a lot  Devin booker was the #2, hawks aren’t a championship team and Middleton is better than CJ  Ben has all stars and an all nba"
but devin booker is?
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
In the timeless words of Devin Booker: “Damn”
These playoffs were best known for how many star injuries there were and this dude is this gassed up after beating Devin Booker and 36 year old cp3
"Everyone lights up the clippers in the playoffs so I'm not sure that's saying anything.   Every series this clippers team has played over the last 2 years there's an opposing perimeter player that averages 30+ a game against them.   Luka x2, Murray, Mitchell, etc. Hell both Chris Paul and Devin Booker had 40 point games against them lmao"
Devin Booker is not better than KAT and Butler. SGA is too low.
I think people are mistaken what I’m saying as Giannis slander lol. It’s like culture I’m talking about. Giannis is a fantastic player and seems like a great human being. Just why should we care that some bandwagon idiots took 8 years to notice this? That’s 1.5 million people who would have called him a choker and followed devin booker and Ayton if they won instead. They aren’t really fans..
"&gt;15 - Devin Booker, Karl Anthony Towns, Kristaps Porzingis, D’Angelo Russell, Myles Turner  So KP is a SF here?"
"Yeah but you can straight up tell when nephews dont watch games. Box scores tell maybe 20 percent of the story and it shows when you try to talk about a game withour watching it.  Its impossible to watch every game. Like just from highlights and box scores i liked the suns. Watched them in playoffs, fuck those cats. Whiney losers. People  were coming into the post game threat talking about how great devin booker was because of his 40 pt games were not watching."
"Dope post, like the effort you put into some of these man  Lmao at the Scott foster posts. Crazy how ref names are just as commonly said as some actual stars’ names, especially nowadays.   In some of these games that take an hour for the last quarter to finish because of officiating, Ive heard Mike Breen say ‘Scott Foster’ or ‘Zack Zarba’ more than Devin Booker"
"Game was really close through most of it. I feel like inexperience really got to them in general though. In their previous series it really felt like they were playing as a team, moving a lot without the ball and making the right passes. Everybody was involved. Then vs the Bucks they'd do that for a quarter followed by 3 quarters of Devin Booker isos, and that final game was even worse in that regard. Booker is a great young player but it made them really predictable and easy to defend."
West pulling up from mid range doesn’t look that different from some of the moves that Devin Booker uses today.
Yea meanwhile there’s guys this sub sucks off like Ben Taylor who can do no wrong to them  Love them both but Ik Rusty would be clowned a lot more for thinking that Devin Booker is an empty stats player or that James Harden can’t help your team win a championship
Nobody thinks Devin Booker is underrated anymore after this playoffs lmao
Is Devin Booker just an empty stats guy
"Man fuck him. Dirk put a punch of vets on his back and beat the super heat. Devin booker is awesome but The bucks did not play Prime Lebron, Dwade and Bosh."
"Again the people he checked, pestered and sometimes shut down this postseason:  James Harden   Kevin Durant   Jimmy Butler   Devin Booker   Trae Young   Lou Williams   Kyrie Irving   CP3  Some Revis Island shit right there."
but DeViN bOoKeR nExT kObE bRyAnT
if devin booker is then dame definitely is lol tf
"At the beginning of the year he predicted that the suns would be so bad that Devin Booker would demand out, they’d trade CP3, and start tanking again. He continually looks like an idiot"
"Ok I agree about being a bit overrated but now you’re just going too far and underrating him lol. Just because he shoots an average percentage, doesn’t mean he’s actually average. You’re ignoring volume. Idk why people don’t understand this, but the more you shoot, the harder it is to make a good percentage. 5.5 attempts on 34% shooting for Devin Booker this regular season, compared to Kevin Durant’s 5 attempts on 35% shooting in 2018-2019. Is Kevin Durant league average from 3? Devin Booker is a good, not great 3pt shooter. Definitely not average.   And yes I know KD’s percentages were lights out this year (45% on 5.4 attempts), but it was a much smaller sample size due to minutes limitation and shortened season. Also not trying to say Booker’s as good a shooter as KD, just proving a point on why volume matters."
Not to mention the regular season games this year were one point losses. And one of those losses came from a ….devin Booker flop to shoot buzzer beater FTs
"I forgot that 36 year old Chris Paul and Devin Booker were on the level of prime Bron, Wade and Bosh. My bad!"
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Suns game when gunshots rang out in my house. It turns out the sound was just Devin Booker bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down Devin!
"Sometimes I feel like we've gotten past the times where Dame was underrated then I see shit like this. I really don't know how you can watch the guy and still feel like this.  Maybe that's it, maybe you don't watch him.  You just watched a team led by Chris Paul/Devin Booker make the finals and you think somehow Dame Lillard isn't good enough to be that lol.  People have a really hard time separating how good a player is from how good their team is. You stick him next to Lebron for a year and people would think he was a god.    &gt; and average playmaker at best.  This is just hilariously wrong.  He was 7th in assists last year.  He was 16th in turnovers. He averaged 10 assists a game on TWO turnovers a game this year in the playoffs. In 2020 he lead a team starting Hassan Whiteside and Carmelo Anthony(with Mario Hezonja 2nd off the bench) to the 3rd best offense in the league.  He's statistically the best pnr guard in the league, and actually set the highest recorded ppp for PnRs in league history.   &gt;  but he is also a high volume shooter.  ...in the last two years he's averaged just under 30ppg on 62.5% TS.  He's one of the most efficient players in the league."
Devin Booker and Jae Crowder each missed 7 three pointers in game 6
"Devin Booker is pretty terrible player if you look at his advanced stats. CP3, on the other hand, shines both offensively and defensively."
"Bruh, Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker on the shelf, lmao...."
Kevin Porter Jr.   Devin Booker  Evan Fournier  Kevin Durant  Kevin Love    Love is getting smoked at the 5 otherwise they’re alright   Where were you when I rhymed Kevin with Kevin and Kevin?
Felt that same way in 2011 my dude. Hoping some of the young pack now will see Giannis do it and maybe in a few years a Ja Morant or Jokic or Devin Booker (sorry Suns fans) will be the one talking about how proud they were to do it with the team that drafted them.
"I think people sometimes put too much weight on numbers and accomplishments than the context in which they occurred.  For example: Malone and Barkley lost to Jordan in the finals.  Everybody lost to Jordan in the finals.  If they had lost to the Knicks and Patrick Ewing, they'd have the same numbers (meaning: 0 rings) but they'd probably be less respected than they are now.  Now the story is: they got beaten by Jordan.  If it were the Knicks, the story would be ""they lost to Patrick Ewing"".  Barkley lost to Jordan. Well shit, who didn't?  Dirk beat Lebron, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Tough competition.  Giannis beat an old Chris Paul and a young Devin Booker and a young Deandre Ayton. I love the fact that Giannis won, but I'm not sure if 10 years from now we still think he went up against a really tough opponent.  Then again, Giannis might have a few more rings a few more years from now and that changes the story completely.  My point is: it's just too soon to be making all these statements about where Giannis stacks up historically.  He's not even done yet."
Overrated shooter I would say Devin Booker. He has a career 3pt% of 35.2% which is just meh.   Underrated shooter I would say Nikola Vucevic. Has been one of the best mid range shooters in the NBA for awhile and now he’s knocking down over 40% from 3.
"On the finals game look at that one block Giannis does on Devin. Booker falls to the ground, but keeps his feet straight and notice Giannis gets tripped up."
I don’t know man. It was pretty clear to me that porzingis was more impactful in these playoffs than Devin Booker
Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker
Jaylen Brown ——&gt; Kawhi Leonard ——&gt; Michael Jordan  Devin Booker ——&gt; Jayson Tatum ——&gt; Kobe Bryant
Devin Booker -&gt; Vince Carter -&gt; Kobe Bryant -&gt; Michael Jordan
The team that Giannis beat to win his first championship is objectively worse than any team that beat during LeBron's first Cavs tenure.  It is the worst conference championship team since Kidd's Nets. Its best player in Devin Booker couldnt even make an All-NBA team.
"Uhhhh no. I'm going to name 11 guys, and then ask how the fuck you justify ranking Devin Booker ahead of any of them (in no particular order):  1. Kevin Durant 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Nikola Jokic 4. LeBron James 5. James Harden 6. Anthony Davis 7. Joel Embiid 8. Steph Curry 9. Damian Lillard 10. Kawhi Leonard 11. Luka Doncic"
Devin Booker isn’t better than Kevin Johnson or Joe Johnson
Hey I love me some Giannis and Devin Booker so that's a good call my dude
"Steph had to beat the second best player of all time, and 2 time champion, in the finals.   giannis had to go against CP3 and devin booker, who have never been to the finals.  also, nets were just as injured as that cavs team."
I mean if you're talking about the elimination game that wouldn't be on CP3. It would be Devin Booker and in some way Ayton. He was probably talking specifically talking about this game.
I do agree the bucks were the good guys  Chris Paul and Devin Booker were so irritating to watch with the way they look for calls and cry to the refs.
Anyone catch that when the Bucks won he walked off the field to the locker room without shaking any hands? Devin Booker stuck around to congratulate them. Pathetic behavior from a 16 year vet who's also president of the player's association. Yet he won't get called out for like Lebron was.
"Yeah I guess i phrased it poorly. more so it's surprising to think that the Magic have been in a Finals in recent memory considering how bad they've been since. It just goes to show that when you get opportunities like this, you have to seize them. That's why it sucks for Devin Booker right now.   But yeah in those late 2000s early 2010s, Dwight was an absolute monster on both sides of the ball. Turkoglu had the playoffs of his career and I was always a fan of Rashard Lewis. They were definitely a good team, but they've fallen so dramatically and so quickly"
"Devin Booker is not more offensively talented than Giannis. Giannis just scored 50 points in one of the most important games of his life! And he was consistent throughout the Finals! Like literally how dare you, lol. The nerve!"
"I mean you guys would be salty too if devin booker went down and you lost 3 in a row. The difference is we're salty cause of the way we lost, and ya'll just legitimately hate us. I've peaked at the suns subreddit and every other post is ""fuck the lakers"" even shit that has nothing to do with us. You won the series so what do you even still have to still be mad about?  I can't say I agree with our fans brigading your sub and I agree a portion of our fanbase can be really obnoxious. But man that doesn't mean I have to get random PM's from sun's fans saying ""fuck you and fuck the lakers"" or dumb shit about how I should stay mad because  ""[we] would have lost anyway""."
"Suns fans stopped being and acting like underdogs after winning 2-0. Then they started losing. When Devin Booker should have fouled out in the opinion of everyone, except delusional Suns fans, and kept fouling and complaining to refs naturally we were disgusted as fans of the game."
"Devin Booker probably wants to trade, so another run like this seems a bit unlikely for the Suns."
Devin Booker hugs say hello...
"no he did not lmao   no one is gonna remember devin booker and his 40/4/3 on 33 shots   it’s a damn good game, but it’s okay to say he could have passed some of those shots up"
"Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson  Future is sunny"
I bet you that Chris Paul and Devin Booker beg to differ
i never understood this “kardashian curse” bs. let folks date who they want to. kendall is pretty af and devin booker is handsome. they make a good couple.  y’all need to stop worrying about people’s relationships.
"Kyrie Irving is a better 3 point shooter, mid range shooter, finisher at the rim, playmaker, and ball handler than Devin Booker. And any difference in defense is negligible."
"He probably did it to try setting an example for his team. Chris Paul gave zero congratz and was a little cry baby bitch crying on his way to the locker room. Should be interesting seeing Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton play on the same team during the Olympics."
"And 5 big-time blocks! Giannis was in Greek God mode to close the Finals out man.  Also fun stat: in the only potential lowlight, Giannis tied for the most TOs in the game at 6. Tied with Devin Booker lol."
"I mean i wouldn't say the window is closed, Ayton was looking like a bust before this season but showed alot in the playoffs, I know he didn't look great in the finals but for a guy like that in his 1st postseason getting matched up against Giannis is worst case scenario, Devin Booker dropped back to back 40 pieces in the finals and hes only gonna get better, cam Johnson showed flashes and hes only gonna get better, I dont know about cp3 tho, he looked great all season but in the finals he was looking old hes definitely past his prime and this offseason is like a month in a half I dont know how much longer he can keep it up.  But that being said they made the finals this year and honestly if they had 1 more player that could create his own shot consistently they would have won"
"In the second half, I was like “why is PJ guarding CP3 when Jrue worked so well on him earlier in the series”? And the answer was that Jrue was busy guarding a much more likely scorer named Devin Booker instead.  Basically cutting off Paul from feeding Booker.  Booker’s “poor” statistical performance has a lot more to do with Jrue’s defense than Booker’s own offense."
I think Paul George in his current form is better than Booker in his current form.  But Devin Booker is 24 and Paul George is 31.
What on earth will Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns do without your support? Losing a championship pales in comparison.
"&gt;	can’t and won’t do what Giannis just did lmao  What did Giannis just do? Serious question. Beat Trae Young, Devin Booker and a hobbled Nets team? Congrats, but doesn’t seem like the hardest achievement"
Devin Booker trying to order but keeps missing the drive thru.
"He just wants to get every superstar doesn’t he? Maybe he should steal Luka, Giannis, Devin Booker, and Tatum too"
"well yeah because this is a thread about Devin Booker.  You wanna talk about other young guys that fit the mold? Trae Young, Ja, Zion, etc I'd rep them too.  But why the fuck would I bring them up in a conversation about Devin Booker? lmao"
And devin booker
"&gt;He didn’t have to win them all but he wasn’t even flirting with five hundred.  Suns ended up just short of .500 in 2020 and that was with DeAndre Ayton being suspended for almost half the season.  It's just a dumb standard.  Anyone with a brain can see that they were losing because they had an absolute dogshit roster, not because Devin Booker wasn't ""good enough"". Even LeBron in 2019 with a Lakers squad better than anything Book had in Phoenix didn't make the playoffs.    My point here though is you're blatantly changing the goalpost.  First it was that Booker didn't win. Fine. But then this year Booker is the best player on the 2nd seed in the West, gets his team to the NBA finals as a 1st option, and then proceeds to put up back to back 40 point games in the NBA finals, and was 28/5/4 in his first ever postseason.  Clearly Booker has won this year and he balled the fuck out.  Rather than acknowledging that, the narrative changes to he didn't win it *alone*.  It's a garbage take and completely unfair because plenty of other stars haven't done shit until they got a good team around them.  EDIT: It has nothing to do with me being a fan of his and everything to do with this being an absolutely stupid take.  I would rep this stance for any of the young stars who haven't won much yet."
This thread is a mess. Are y'all gonna give De'Aaron Fox praise if he stays with Sacramento and their FO continues to do what they always do? Or are y'all gonna give him the Devin Booker/Trae Young treatment when they weren't in the playoffs?
"We need the one where, I believe, Devin Booker had someone wide open on a fast break and he overthrew the pass. Might have been the turnover at the 11:08 mark in the 4th quarter."
"He definitely didn’t choke, but it also felt like he didn’t rise to meet the moment when the game was really in the balance.   With 7:21 left in the game, Paul hit 2 free throws to make it a 4-point game. It took nearly 7 minutes for Paul to attempt another shot (a missed 3 with 37 seconds remaining). He didn’t register an assist. He had one rebound.   He was outshot in that period by Devin Booker (understandable), Jae Crowder, and DeAndre Ayton (far less so). And it didn’t feel like he was orchestrating the offense either — he was far more mortal than his usual Point God moniker.   I don’t think he “choked,” especially since it does look like something’s physically wrong with him (that late turnover was just — not Chris Paul), but he definitely didn’t seize the moment like you would hope for a player of his caliber in a moment of this magnitude."
You can tell watching them celebrate hit him hard....that shit stays with you and with that being said I say this Devin Booker will see the finals again
He pushed for OKC to draft devin booker and they drafted Cameron Payne instead
Idk man. He's definitely gonna improve and be a better player. I just don't see him becoming one of the great SGs of this league. There's just something missing.  Ive been watching NBA since the days of Pete maravich. I'm an old dude. There is this spark you feel from future HOFers. Two guys currently who don't give me this are Klay Thompson and Devin Booker. They will become HOFers. It just seems like their game ain't explosive. Idk maybe im wrong
"He was praising Devin Booker pretty early on as well and also gave Jrue his respect, saying he’s probably the best defender."

"Chris Paul is an all timer, idc what anyone says and if he ever wins a title. Devin Booker just went to his first playoffs and I think did pretty well all things considered.  Saying that the Suns would have lost to all these other teams is just speculation and who cares really, someone had to get through this year, and they did. Not sure how this is so difficult to accept. Someone needs to get through. Period."
Devin Booker LOST in the finals.
James Harden and Devin Booker in shambles.
"ESPN: Booker says ""nothing personal towards Holiday and Middleton"" does he want out of Phoenix?   Bleacher Report: 3 impossible trades for Devin Booker now that he wants out of Sun's"
ESPN: Did Devin Booker Imply Kobe was not a Man?
ESPN: Does Devin Booker care enough about winning?
Durant does a rip-through where he invents a shot that requires him to swing his arms sideways across your arm when normally he just goes straight up to shoot.  The off-arm hook is when you are driving and you grab the other players arm and kind of make it look like they are hooking you and draw a foul against the other player's will who is just trying to stay in between the basket and you. Devin Booker does this shit every time.
Devin Booker and Trae Young in shambles
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can’t take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that’s better than all those all stars lol"
I'm pretty sure the NBA Finals exposed how bad flopping has got in the NBA to the masses. Devin Booker and Chris Paul were insufferable with it! Booker has now surpassed CP3 in the flop department. Bobby Portis set a pick after the play was over to stop Booker from getting to the refs to bitch some more.
"# Team USA  * STARTERS:     * Curry, Harden, LeBron, Durant &amp; Anthony Davis * BENCH:    * Kyrie, Lilliard, Tatum, Paul George, Devin Booker, Beal &amp; Zion  # Team Euro  * STARTERS:    * Luka Dončić, Bojan Bogdanović, Giannis, Jokić &amp; Gobert    * BENCH:    * Domantas Sabonis, Clint Capela, Evan Fournier, Dennis Schröder, Bogdan Bogdanović &amp; Rubio"
The fact is Book was 21st in the NBA in FT/game. Probably not a foul baiter if that's the case.  The fact is the Suns were beating the Lakers when both teams had everyone healthy (except CP3 was still hurt)  The likely fact is the Suns would've been up 2-0 on Bron/AD had CP3 not gotten hurt.  The fact is the Suns had an average margin of victory of 18 points per game against the Nuggets. Don't think Jamal Murray would've made that a win for the Nuggets.  The fact is you need to learn to cope with Devin Booker being a star in the NBA and stop crying about it lmao
Himself. Devin “Hanamichi Sakuragi” Booker
Devin Booker new hair cut is cursed and no one can tell me otherwise
Devin ARMANI booker
For some reason Devin Booker wearing #15 is the weirdest number change on this team to me
It’s pretty funny I’m watching some Russian commentating stream and they call Durant KD. “Sahgdjfjvfjgfjffhj KD! sdjfhgdjfjhfggg Lillard! sjgxjggnghgdjh devin booker!”
Devin Booker future MVP? like 12-15 dudes would have to miss significant time
Devin Booker will not pass it to Khris Middleton or Jute Holiday!
Devin Booker was a bench player in college
"It actually makes a ton of sense. For a teams with one player that is clearly the best, they have the ability to run a pretty traditional offense. Star play gets fed the ball, everyone else plays their role. Problem with team USA is you they have a bunch of dudes who are the stars for their team. It's a lot harder to tell Devin Booker or Zach Lavine that their role is to defend and space the floor."
"Devin Booker used that arm hook so much. Him, Harden and Trae gonna have to adjust"
Yes no more slight minor contact on Devin Booker being called.
"Yeah that’s why he was 27th in FTA despite being first in touches as a paint scoring, bruising center. This ain’t Trae or Devin Booker"
Devin Booker just became a 15ppg scorer
"RIP James Harden, Trae Young, CP3, Devin Booker"
"I’m not happy but there’s nothing wrong with me, I just preferred devin “hooker” booker"
"Devin Booker would have been FMVP had they won, so he wasn't carrying. Role players did step up  - it's how they got to the finals. I agree the team had not experienced heartbreaking losses like Giannis did. There  just was no answer for Giannis from the Suns. Definitely wanted CP to get a ring, but he will have to live to fight another day"
as an /r/nba nephew im happier those bums devin booker and jae crowder lost
"cp3 was getting hunted by the bucks, whatever extra points he gets he's just giving back  it's a hot take because it's something you're all too insecure to admit  &gt; off court impact that CP3 brought to this organization and Devin Booker specifically  ah yeah the classic ""when it gets hard to prove on court, start coming up with invisible meaningless shit""  &gt;  Love Kyle but his impact on development isn’t in the same breath as CP3  love cp3 but kyle didn't shit his pants the first time he got to the finals. let alone against a worse team :)"
I assume Devin Booker and Kendall Jenner
Then you should wait until he gets one or two all-stars to say that. Devin Booker looks like a perennial all-star. Donovan Mitchell looks like perennial all-star.  Guys that haven’t even made it once don’t “look like” they can do it *consistently*.
I do.   Keep in mind the west is so stacked that not even devin booker could make it till injury replacement
"No no you get me wrong. Presti should have traded Westbrook 8 years earlier rather than than trading Harden, and then move him ASAP.  After they land SGA they land CP3. And Gallo was there too. Adams, Grant, and other good players.  That team all together will be by far better than this year Suns. And they was almost 4th last year too (i think same record than the Rockets)!  They basically blow out a 4th seed in the Western Conference, with a rising superstar, only to rebuilt from the scratches. I bet all my money they won't be again a 4th seed before SGA probably get sick of loosing and asking out. And then you have to rebuilt again. Hope it didn't happen for you fans of OKC, but this happens most of the time in the NBA.  So Presti really shipped out a team that could compete for the Finals for picks and nothing more. You don't know what you will get, you only know you are wasting the prime of an amazing player like SGA. Which by all means isn't inferior to Devin Booker a guy the Suns started to built around for 2 years now."
Devin booker is a lil bitch
"Hell, Suns might look for a backup PG this season. He's probably thrilled to play behind Chris Paul and Devin Booker again."
"Rotation needs to be cut down by a lot. No need to be playing Keldon Johnson 9 mins. KD was in a bit of foul trouble vs France which can explain why he only played 20 mins, but he needs to be playing 30+ in important games going forward. One of Bam/Draymond needs to be on the floor at all times in any important game. I really don’t see the need for Lavine to be starting or even playing at all. Middleton, Holiday, and Booker are strictly better and should take over all of his minutes by the elimination stage.   The next two games for Team USA should be easy to win, so Pop should use those 2 games to get a fixed gameplay/style of play and to find the right number of players in the shortened rotation. The biggest problem is there is no identity with this team. It’s not even the lack of chemistry - it’s not like Luka played with Mike Tobey prior to the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Matisse Thybulle never played with Australia prior to the Olympics. The Nigeria team that beat Team USA in the exhibition had even fewer reps playing with each other than the US team did. It’s just that guys like Mike Tobey and Matisse Thybulle know their role.   Players like Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker, etc. don’t know their role on this team - it needs to be made clear to them they play defense and play more of a 3rd/4th option to KD/Lillard on offense or they get benched. That’s why it’s easier for Jrue Holiday to adjust - he already played this role with the Bucks, unlike the other stars who were #1 options on their teams. And if you don’t want to bench or threaten to bench Jayson Tatum or Zach Lavine for the entire game because they are “too good” be benched, well that’s why they won’t win."
"I never *wanted* to dislike Devin Booker, but here we are"
"Jerami Grant got 0 minutes in the games that USA lost so I don't know what your point is about the team being better with him when he wasn't even given a chance.  Devin booker was on a 11 hour flight a few hours before the game, and was playing in the finals less than a week ago.   Bam Adebayo played great last game, he was not the reason they lost.  Seems like you just hate every young player seeing that you ignore context and blame the them for every failure of the US team and dismiss KD or Dame's bad playing since they are ""proven"". Quit your bullshit"
Devin Booker?
"Devin Booker. doesn’t get to the rim. Doesn’t really draw help, doesn’t really pass at an elite level, and doesn’t take off the dribble threes. Really hard to dominate  the game as a not physically imposing 2 guard who only takes difficult long twos. Yes I saw him have two forty point games in the finals. The suns lost both.  He’s a good scoring guard but I don’t think he’s a #1 option on an elite offense."
"I would say Anthony Davis, Devin Booker, Karl Anthony Towns, and John Wall have had decent careers."
"That's what was said about Devin Booker and Trae young, though."
"I've see a lot of players live in the last 20 years. Tmac may not be the best scorer I've ever seen but he was the smoothest.   Like, the best comparison I could make is Devin Booker in Giannis' body. He made buckets look so easy.   I got lucky enough to see him play Kobe in 08, cant remember if it was the season opener or opening week.   Kobe was so explosive in 08 but Mac could just glide man."
"""Part time star."" No load management BS from Devin Booker during the season. Went 14-8 in the NBA playoffs, went directly from the NBA Finals to Tokyo to play in the Olympics. Part time my ass."
"You're fucking insane dude. Devin Booker is efficient as hell. Sure, he's adapted his game to play within the NBA system where foul baiting is rewarded. Either way, he gets his points."
all aboard the devin booker hate train
"Shh, Devin Booker is bailed out by refs more than any player in league history. That’s the narrative now buddy and we just have to go with it"
idk he does have the suns flair so maybe he does know Devin Booker more than Devin Booker
You mean the Devin booker that averages nearly 30 PPG in the finals with less then 5 FTA?
"The dude just lost finals, gets clowned for being the next Kobe, and has to carry a shitty USA basketball team. How would you feel if you were Devin Booker in these times?"
"Devin Booker for sure, right mixture of handsomeness and wholesomeness (he don’t look like a thot). Perfect for parents"
Tell that to Devin Booker
Devin Booker is a grade A bitch

U know more about devin bookers development than devin booker himself?
"From a relationship standpoint and developing his mentality, sure.   As a HC he was awful. That being said as an assistant he’ll be fine. Devin Booker is responsible for Devin’s development"
Devin booker without nba refs is Kevin Martin
"So I didn't heed to country boundaries, which is why Montrealers like Dort, Chris Boucher &amp; Karim Mané are on the Celtics, since Montreal is closer to Boston than to Toronto as the crow flies. The only players I manually sent to teams were Andre Drummond &amp; Devin Booker, as they were crossing large bodies of water."

"They’ve got Devin Booker, literally Kobe 2.0  /s"
"If a 19 year old put up 15 straight NBA games of 70 points, I would be calling them the greatest athlete in human history. No shit they’d get a max contract lol.   70 points is absolute bonkers, I remember very vividly where I was when I got the notification that Devin Booker dropped 70 in a meaningless end of season loss. I couldn’t believe it, it was the only thing anyone wanted to talk about for the rest of the night and the next day. If someone did that 15 times straight, we’d have to take them in for questioning."
"Bruh ppl said the same shit about Devin booker and he was just the best guy on a finals team. Kawhi is the same type of player. Roster construction and how you complement a star player is very important. Also, Lillard was 7th in the league this season in assists and averaged 10.5 in the playoffs. Continue proving that you don’t actually watch games"
"Lmao dude gets injured and has a bad year and people start rewriting history... Kemba was an All-Star starter his last year in Charlotte and an All-Star last season on a 50 win team, fuck off with ""empty stats"" nonsense has Devin Booker showed y'all nothing?  The concern with Kemba was his age and his knees. Which is his issue right now."
"To be fair I would expect a lineup with KD, Dame, Devin Booker and Zach Lavine to be able to make something. Not like they put scrubs out there instead of Middleton"
"Michigan would be good:  **Starters**: Monte Morris - Devin Booker - Miles Bridges - Draymond Green - Javale McGee  **Bench:** Bryn Forbes, Edmond Sumner, Denzel Valentine, Josh Jackson  **Coach:** Magic Johnson  **Cheerleader:** Jalen Rose  **Water boy:** Kyle Kuzma"
How many All-NBA players are on Team USA this year? 3.5 (if you count that KD makes it playing all year). Out of 10/11 Americans on the All NBA teams.  I don't think this Team USA says very much about the NBA's best stars because they're generally not a part of it.  Zach Lavine and Devin Booker would be like the equivalents of Mitch Richmond and Glen Rice. I see no reason to compare them to Jordan and Pippen.
"This right here! I’ve been saying this for the longest time. Harden for sure has exploited the rules. Another player who is guilty of this is CP3, who is such a flopper. He hooks, he stops suddenly, he kicks his legs forward when he shoots a three, all to make contact “in the act of shooting.” Dude is a crybaby schemer. That’s what happened when Clipper Beverly was defending him, CP3 kicks his legs to draw the foul but Beverly is caught in the pick and roll. Well, CP3 landed flat on his back in a very painful way. Beverly didnt do anything wrong, it was CP3 who overcommitted to the flop and he paid the price for it.  I hate players like that. Unfortunately, Devin Booker has been schooled by CP3 and he’s becoming quite a flopper/crybaby himself. I rooted against the Suns bc of all the flopping. I hate teams like that."
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De’Aron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
"Guys, I think Kevin Durant, Zach LaVine and Devin Booker each had more fouls than field-goals vs France."
Devin Booker 3 years ago: I wish I could play with better teammates   *monkey paw curls*
Devin Booker has now lost 5 straight games
Imagine how Devin Booker feels. He goes from losing four straight games in the finals to losing to France
Why is Devin Booker on this team lol.
"You have to actually perform some analysis. It can't be just down to ""wins"" because Frank Kaminsky won just as many games as Devin Booker this year, because wins are a team result. It's not the Phoenix Bookers.  I never said Booker was an empty stats player, I don't believe any stats are truly empty, so don't pin some old grievances on me. His stats just have never been as good as he's supposed to be. Everyone shuts their eyes when he has god awful offensive games and then laser focuses when he has a good game, ignoring that when he is bad at shooting the ball he provides essentially nothing else to his team the way all other 'superstars' do. Yes, KAT and Zion are better players. I don't care about wins out of context - there are half a dozen shootings guards who would have made the finals with the suns (Mitchell, Beal, Harden, Lavine, SGA). I say those two are better because they contribute more to their team, and if you look beyond flashy turnaround midrange shots, it's very clear when you watch games. Advanced stats have always backed this up; if you think Booker's stats when the suns were bad were real (which they were), you should believe KAT is better, as KAT's stats (analytic &amp; box) are far greater than Booker's."
"I know people who don't watch the regular season and only saw him in the playoffs are going to think I'm being ridiculous, but Devin Booker averages less free throws per game than almost every name I've seen mentioned in this thread so far. I would definitely say he fits this one."
"How do Jrue and Devin have the legs for this? They must be absolutely gassed.   However they do it, I really hope they win a gold. Booker deserves it after that finals loss and the Holidays are one of the most generous families in the world."
NBA All-Stars?   Devin Booker  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Zach LaVine  JaVale McGee  Jrue Holiday  Bam Adebayo  Khris Middleton  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Draymond Green  Keldon Johnson  There are no better players in USA than these? Only one I even know is Kevin Durant.
Devin Booker fr flew 12 hours just to lose another game
Devin Booker looks like he doesn’t even want to be there
This roster construction is ass.   Like what’s the point of Devin Booker when you already have a small army of dudes just like him but better.   Wouldn’t like a Marcus Smart be better for matchup purposes?
Devin Booker just lost 5 straight games
Evan Fournier is just a better Devin Booker
"ngl, haircut Devin Booker is cute"
It's kind of weird that I have to like Devin Booker now...
"Devin ""Kevin Durant"" Booker"
"LeBron gave Kevin Love depression, Giannis made Devin Booker get a haircut. Just goat things"
"Sure feels like it. Announcer mistakenly called Devin Booker ""Zach Lavine."""
"LOL. Reggie was really solid, but he was never even seen as a top 10 player in the NBA. Theres a reason he only got on 3 all NBA teams his entire career, and all were 3rd team.   He was a lot closer to a devin booker/bradley beal/jayson tatum level player at his peak than an MVP candidate who got robbed. Not meaning disrespect, but the rose tinted glasses on reggie are kinda wild."
Considering Jason is only 19 and never been to the finals /s. I’d still pick Booker over Tatum any day. I’d give Devin a A- and tatum a B+.
"He definitely has improved as an on-ball defender. I would consider Booker above average in that aspect if he can limit the amount of fouls he commits per game. His offball defense is what still makes him a bad defender overall. The Suns finished 9th in DRtg this season, but Devin ranks T-15th and 16th out of their 17 players in DRtg and DBPM. He has clearly gotten better over the years and is still young so I think he could become at average-above average defender.   I also give him credit for attempting to play defense vs. a guy like Beal. Beal was an elite college defender and was a good defender in his first three years in the NBA. Now he uses all his energy on offense so he does not put any effort on the defensive end."
"who's more famous internationally, Devin Booker or Booker T?"
"Devin Booker probably showed some respect to Kobe by writing his name on his shoes, saying a prayer, or doing literally anything considered orthodox behaviour. Not sculpting out his fg% in a negative way just for certain numbers."
"I hate this attitude.    &gt; ""We could've very easily got to the last game ... and Devin Booker saying, 'Man, we lost, I'm pissed off, I'm out,' or Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday saying, 'We just won a championship, I want to celebrate and stay home with my family, I'm out,'"" Green said.  No, you don't easily do that and anyone who does should be criticized for it.  You shouldn't have a lot of respect for people doing what they're supposed to do.  Committing to your word is a basic principle one should have."
"Great response! I understand your reasoning on your player tiers. I had Booker in the mid 20s since I rank players differently. I rank players looking at their role and how well they are in that role. For example, I would rather have Booker as the first option over Middleton and CP3, but I would rank Khris and CP3 as the second option over Devin as the first. But I understand your methodology and do think I should take more consideration into that when ranking."
Devin Booker is an abomination to the NBA and is a complete mockery of Kobe Bryant's game
"I think the names you said for 12-16 are clearly higher than Booker.  Also, I think it’s fair for Booker to be below the others you named.  Zion is clearly better than Devin, regardless of his record.  When KAT plays he is better but he is injured frequently so it is debatable. Gobert’s impact on defense = Booker’s impact on offense. Gobert’s offense however is better than Booker’s defense.  Beal and Booker are very close as I think if you switched their teams, Phoenix and Washington would be in similar situations as they ended this season."
You forgot that Devin Booker also had 8 fouls in game 4
What’s that thing that one redditor said about Devin Booker? That he always looks like he’s wearing a Michael Meyers mask from the movie Halloween?
"Kevin Love will probably be remembered in the same way that a guy like Kenny Smith is remembered. That is to say, he was definitely an integral part of some pretty historic moments but he’ll be on ESPN in 15 years getting made fun of for being carried by an all time great. That being said, Kevin Love is a lot better than Kenny Smith and I think in a weaker year he could actually slip into the HoF just off of the pure narrative of the 2016 finals, even if I personally think his case is pretty weak.  As for Devin Booker... idk man. Best shooting guard since Jordan is pretty clearly Kobe or Wade. And I’m a Celtics and Suns fan saying that. I love the man and truly hope he proves me wrong but it will be really tough for him to live up to those legacies, Kobe specifically. Could see him surpassing Wade though."
Off my chest:  Kevin Love was a stat padder in Minnesota and is severely underrated in his Cavs career. The guy is not a Hall of famer and most people won't even remember him when he retires.  Devin Booker is on a path of greatness and if this keeps up we're looking on a best shooting guard since Jordan himself.  Chris Paul's redemption arc is nearly complete and i'm warming up to the fact that people call him Point God  NBA is in a better place when California's teams struggle (except the Kings)
"yeah this is it. Devin Booker is the perfect CP3 companion b/c he's bought into playing a role where he's the primary scorer but secondary ballhandler. I don't think that would've worked with Kobe. And if Chris isn't driving the boat, you're not using him right because his decision making, passing and control of pace are his elite talents."
Devin Booker &gt; Steph Curry
"If it makes u feel any better we passed on Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and Wade/Bosh/Melo. Detroit has had its fair share of blunders in the draft"
"Sir, no. You are forgetting Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Fred VanVleet, Donovan Mitchell, Shia Gilgeous-Alexander, CJ McCollum and Terry Rozier who could arguably be better than him. Booker, Brown, Mitchell and George are all definitely better."
And Devin Booker is a SG
&gt;how is he an empty stats player  Same reason Devin Booker was all those years.
Devin Booker is our best player
As someone who hasn’t watched them play more than 2x all year and just looked at the stats: is Sexton not close to max player material?    He is putting up very good stats at 22. Devin Booker numbers at that age.
"You sound a lot like my dad when we watch the game. The game has changed everyone does walk and carry a lot that isn’t called, it frustrates me too. The amount of complaining frustrates me too. However there are plenty of reasons to be amazed by the game. There are plenty of great moves and shots. The suns moved the ball great last night, Devin booker made some ridiculous shots. That possession where they passed it 10 times and everyone touched the ball was great. I hope you can find pleasure in the good aspects of the game again. My amazement at the shots guys make or moves they make and pleasure in great play far outweighs the frustration."
"Devin Booker is in that weird place where fans just kind of have him where they're always going to have him; when he had better stats than players who won more games, we scolded him for not winning. When he sacrificed his stats to win more games, we fell in love with other players who don't win as many. He's going to be stuck in that 15-20 range until his late 30s imo"
You joke but this definitely warrants suspending Devin Booker for four games.
"But that kinda means he's an empty stats guy  Maybe instead of overreacting to that fact like it makes someone a bad player, we can understand that in a different team construction, a lot of those ""good stats, bad team"" guys can fill a 2nd or 3rd star role and do it at the highest level.  Some guys can still be the go-to scorer but need more around them (i don't think that's Grant)   Devin Booker is a great example, leading a shitty Phoenix team forever until now he's leading a fantastic phoenix team by adding Paul and everyone else around him getting better."
"50 years really is a very short span of time in the grand scheme of things. Regardless, I don't think any NBA player's accomplishment should be discredited, and that includes everyone from the very first season until whichever year far in the future eventually becomes the NBA's last. And frankly, I think it actually makes it more impressive to say ""Chris Paul and Devin Booker just did something that hasn't happened since Jerry West and Johnny Egan did it 52 years ago"" than to just say they're the first within some arbitrary timeframe. It does a better job at both honoring the past and recognizing just how rare what just happened is."
"It's not about having them individually guard whoever, it's about the amount your team defense is taxed by covering for negative defenders. The Bucks put those guys in a lot of defensive actions to try and tilt the defense in a way that favored them, even if Trae was not directly defending the shot that Jrue was taking the space he got was often a direct result of the defense's inability to make up for the group deficiency caused by them.     The same way now the Bucks do not have Pat Connaughton or Brynn Forbes assigned to Devin Booker or Chris Paul, but by virtue of the offense tilting the floor towards those defensive assignments their inability to properly cover their portion of the floor hurts the cumulative defense. Despite Jrue doing an absolutely phenomenal job defensively this round, the guards for the Suns are going off because of these sorts of adjustments that are required."
"So Devin Booker is an incredible talent and its cool he might be about to get a ring, but my god I keep seeing Booker vs \_\_\_\_\_ on NBA Twitter, Tik Tok. etc and people always say ""Oh DBook dropped 70"".  Like even in cases where Booker is the better player this is such a stupid basis for your point.  Tom Chambers scored 60 once.  Durant tops out at 54."
"Worst case scenario, Devin Booker is your point guard, but getting rid of cp3 for Lonzo now because you're worried about your point guard position in 3 years is nonsense. Plus at that point, even if cp3 is that bad, you can trade him for cash and sign a point guard just as good as Lonzo"
You’re only as good as your last game   Right now Devin Booker
"Between this and the ""devin Booker. Looks like a choir boy, plays like a hoodlum"" he was killing it"
"i think he's saying that devin booker and the other suns players are very attractive and put in work on-and-off the court. OP did say,  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You want a guy who gets hype when his teammate is hot."
Who cares hes devin booker a superstar.  Not buck tooth khris
no. Westbrook is the perfect example of what Draymond calls an 82 game player vs a 16 game player  Devin Booker would be lucky to get 10 shots/game with Westbrook
"Kobe isn't in the GOAT convo because how he treated the legend Jeremy Lin. Also he chose to not stay with the Hornets a small market team that drafted him, unlike the greats Michael Jordan and Devin Booker. Kareem is the exception because the Bucks were an exceptionally bad team who no man could have saved."
Devin booker is gone if Phoenix doesn’t win this year
"Based on that statement, What are your opinions on Devin Booker?"
In all of these comparisons people put up since he entered the league the answer has been Devin Booker is 1st. As for Beal vs Lavine. Thats real close. I'd probably take Lavine but it could go either way tbh.
Yea because Devin Booker received multiple top first round picks from 2017-now. Along with Chris Paul. More players would do this if the lottery/draft was different. They wouldn’t need to stockpile talent when they receive talent from the draft.
"""Points scored by the front court in the finals"" isnt a Thad Young stat. Also are you trying to imply CP3 and Devin Booker aren't anywhere close to comparable to Steph and Klay like Thad isn't comparable to those names?"
He's probably never listened to it.  [It's from an article written about Booker from three days ago](https://theundefeated.com/features/suns-devin-booker-dad-pushed-him-to-go-farther-go-further-go-harder/).
"Devin Booker has been playing great defense.  Having CP3, Mikal &amp; Ayton has allowed Booker to put some more effort into the defensive side.  He's no Rudy Gobert out there, but he is playing high level defense in the NBA Finals.  Jrue and Middleton are shooting 11% when guarded by Booker."

"Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton were already providing enough fantastic play for the Phoenix Suns. So when they’re getting 27-point efforts from other players? That makes them pretty unstoppable."
tbf Devin Booker is lighter skinned than Van Gundy....
looks like JVG read this [https://theundefeated.com/features/suns-devin-booker-dad-pushed-him-to-go-farther-go-further-go-harder/](https://theundefeated.com/features/suns-devin-booker-dad-pushed-him-to-go-farther-go-further-go-harder/)
"Lacks greatness?? Are you really that obtuse? Devin Booker, Giannis and CP3 aren’t playing “great” enough for you? Hell, the way PHX is playing I’d put them up against anyone right now."
"Reminds me of the Western Conference Finals. There was a series of plays where Devin Booker tried to back down Patrick Beverley with his shoulder, and Bev flew backwards and got a charge. Very next play Marcus Morris did the same thing to Bridges except it looked like he was much more forceful. Bridges however stood his ground, got forced back, and Morris got an easy bucket. Only difference was Bridges didn't throw his body on the ground and it was a 4-point swing."
DeAndre Ayton is my fucking guy! Chris Paul and Devin Booker are just on another level but watching DeAndre Ayton play just ties the room together. I absolutely love it.
"If it stays as close as it's been for the first two games, it's definitely going to be Chris Paul, even if Booker averages slightly more points, the media narrative around Chris Paul has just been too strong, Devin Booker would have to go off like 06 finals Wade without the help of the officials to take it away"
"Booker make it no secret that he draws inspiration in his game from Kobe.  He has written on his shoes 'Be Legendary' as a tribute to Kobe, after Kobe sent him autographed shoes with that message on them after their first game against one another:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2903475-devin-booker-says-kobe-bryant-serves-as-his-inspiration-with-me-every-day"
"Devin Booker had never hit more than 6 threes in a game in his entire career and he does it twice in the playoffs, once to eliminate Lebron and the second time to take a 2-0 lead in the finals. This dude rises to the fucking occasion"
Devin Booker has a higher chance of making a contested step back 360 three than jrue holiday has of making a layup
Preach man. They're so ungrateful because Devin Booker isn't there yet as the floor leader and CP3 naturally slots in.
"Tariqs Buck Breaking Part 2      The light skinned barbarian devin booker descended from ice age Northern Europe with no melanin and a spirit full of animal rage. After a while staying in Athens Greece having gay sex with men he met a young athlete, proclaimed to be a buck, and the rest was history… Learn that history for only 19.99$"
"Devin Booker is going to win a ring before Lebron did and he didn't have to form a superteam in Miami to do it either. Doesn't choke in finals, plays whole career on one team, and doesn't recruit superstar players to win Mickey rings. Devin Booker is higher up in the GOAT conversation than Lebron EVER will be. Also went to college unlike Lebron who barely even graduated high school (bum)."
They actually did a just relative to last game. Their adjustments went from allowing Devin Booker and CP3 to get whatever the want in the midrange to trapping every time one of them drove down the lane and leaving an open shooter.  They’re not going to stop the Suns defensively. They have the match them offensively. Unfortunately the only answer they have is Giannis. Jrue and Middleton are proving why they’re not stars
"&gt; Defense has to be better, they always leave the suns open for 3.  You can't have this, *and* stop Ayton, *and* defend the CP3/Devin Booker PnR, *and* cover the mid-range. Something has to give. The Suns 3's weren't all from open looks, and they were hitting those that weren't just as well as those that were."

devin booker gets sloppy from the refs on demand and is never satisfied
How does Monty Williams not put in rebounders for the Giannis and1 free throw? Devin Booker is the one who has to go in and body Jrue Holiday for the rebound? They had a timeout and he's more likely to miss that than make it.

I have never disliked someone so much more after a playoff run than i do Devin Booker.. This playoffs all he has done is whine and complain while constantly flopping looking for calls.

devin booker is the only player who flops though right
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker. They're both silky smooth and fun to watch.  And no order on their names; I just alternate between them when I answer questions.
Last year in Mitchell’s 4th season he averaged 26.7 ppg on 57% TS and Devin Booker averaged 25.6 ppg on 59% TS in his 6th season. This is with Devin Booker having Chris Paul on his team and Donovan Mitchell’s 2nd best scoring threat probably being Jordan Clarkson. I’m not like saying TS is the end all be all of efficiency or anything because my main argument is what Mitchell has accomplished as the sole number 1 option compared to what Booker has done before CP3
I know I’m getting downvotes because of recency bias but in reality. Chris Paul was at times the best player on that team and would have very likely won finals MVP. I think Devin Booker is a great player. But Booker lacks length and the speed to blow by players. He isn’t the best shooter and it’s not like he plays above the rim. He is amazing at making tough shots but Mitchell has shown what he is capable of as his teams sole offensive threat and I don’t believe Booker can do what he has done. And I stand by that
Booker? Struggle to create shots? As in Devin booker? Huh?
Devin Booker was already back to a 100% by game 6. CP3 was at like 80%. AD couldn't play like 5 mins. And Lebron was very obviously not playing the same bcz of his injuries.
Sure. But what about devin booker and DeAndre Ayton?
1. James Harden  2. Klay Thompson  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Devin Booker  5. Zach LaVine  6. Bradley Beal  7. Jaylen Brown  8. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  9. Colin Sexton  10. CJ McCollum
"Maybe Morey is envisioning a 5 team trade where every team fleeces the next team by increasing amounts, so that by the time the trade loops back around the Sixers have Dame, and somehow Portland has Khris Middleton, Clint Capela, Devin Booker, and now Steve Nash is somehow back in the league and Brooklyn is coached by Harden and KD screaming at eachother"
"It ruined it but gave us the chance of something new. Finally seeing Chris Paul in the finals, Devin Booker having playoff success, Giannis proving haters wrong, ~~Blazers getting out of the first round~~, Paul George and other role players stepping up.   I know it isn't the Starpower or bracket we expect but seeing something other than LeBron, Curry, and KD roll through the playoffs can still be refreshing and entertaining even if the process to get there wasn't what we wanted"
&gt; They didn’t even have a top 10 player either and relied on inefficient shooting philosophies  Mid range shots are only inefficient for average shooters.  The best in the league at hitting those shots make them efficient and viable.  Devin Booker and CP3 are two of the best mid range players in the league.  They should be taking those shots when they're available.
Too many great finals runs get forgotten because only one team wins a championship each season.      There's Also the fact that if you don't win it all it's a choke and people love to talk about failures instead. Chris Paul and Devin Booker seemed to get more criticism for blowing a 2-0 lead and losing the finals this year than other teams did for not making it that far. Also I've seen more people talk about Dirk's failures in 2007 than this playoffs run.
"Devin Booker - Grand Rapids, Michigan"
I think he has great shot creation potential. I see his max potential reaching a more perimeter oriented version of devin booker. He has a nice handle and has that irrational confidence type while also being in a great coaching system. He’s shown some passing chops as well I don’t think he’ll become an amazing playmaker but good enough that it’ll keep his game varied.
Imagine trying to trade Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker.  Game 6 2021 First Round. Booker scored 47 pts. Kuzma wasnt too far behind with 2 pts
"Devin Booker is a great 3pt shooter…just not in games lmao. We have seen the 3pt contest, practice highlights, even Kentucky highlights. He can catch and shoot very well.  However he takes some bad 3s when the Suns need to be bailed out of a possession. His shot quality is so low it makes him look like a terrible 3pt shooter. If he was just a 3&amp;D player and shoot some corner threes here and there he would look great."
"You’re saying Booker isn’t a three level scorer?  Psssh.  What would happen if teams just gave him open threes? He’d make them at a 40% clip, easily.  Devin Booker is a classic three level scorer. Most of the threes he takes are contested shots that he has to take (short clock, defense has taken away everything else) but make no mistake that he opens up the lane with his ability to take and make open threes, and that is as three level as it gets."
"Lol. I said ""could be"" for Zion and ""potentially"" for LaMelo and Jalen Green. I think that to be the kind of dude I'm talking about -- to have that kind of sway -- you have to at least be in the conversation for best player in the league for meaningful stretches of time. I don't even really think Westbrook or Dame have ever been on that level; it's really just (among active players right now) LeBron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, and maybe now Giannis. I don't think it's some slap in the face to Trae Young or Devin Booker to think that they might not ever be in the conversation for best player in the entire NBA (whereas Luka seems destined to be, and Giannis has just become a part of that conversation)."

"This seems fun I want to try Tyler Herro, CJ McCollum and Devin Booker"
"Even as a not huge devin booker guy, yes, of course he is."
"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"

While Devin is a better pure scorer Klay is a better defender and deep shooter. Klay absolutely isn’t overrated as he’s known as a good defender and one of the best shooters ever. Devin is known as a walking bucket. Depends what you want. But I did give you a link of Klay’s top scoring games."
"Um the Suns?!?!?!?!  Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Eddie Johnson, Charles Barkley and Shaq.  Subs like Amare Stoudemire, Tom Chambers, Deandre Ayton, Chris Paul, Kevin Johnson."
Devin Booker is easily the better player so him
"I think they have a shot if Lebron, AD, KD, harden, Kyrie, Steph, dame, luka, Giannis, Trae young, Middleton, jimmy butler, jokic, Rudy gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum, Julius randle, Devin booker, Chris Paul, Paul George, embiid and ja Morant suffer season ending injuries"
Yeah was looking at career. But he had the same as Devin Booker and he was 6th in the league in scoring. I think he should be in the convo at 22 years old
"That's a pretty whatever foul call, that's what a ton of steals are. The Jrue Holiday steal on Devin Booker in the Finals was similar, Ben Simmons had steals like that on Trae, it is what it is."
"Not ADs fault new Orleans couldn't build a team properly around him. AD was the only reason new Orleans was competing. With that logic Donovan Mitchell, trae young, and Devin booker are better than Luka just bc they have made it further and had more success. ( I'm not saying AD is better than kawhi, Giannis and Harden btw)"
A year ago it was Devin booker. Lots of dudes hating on him cause his team wasn’t winning. Thankfully that’s been rectified.
"Devin Booker is not underrated at all the hell lol, the media treats him like a superstar now and I see people consistently rating him higher than people like Butler, PG, Kyrie.   No way u believe this"
"Devin Booker, just had a great season and playoff run and led the team to the finals while injured and people act like he was bad. His stock somehow dropped after the playoffs. He carried the team in the finals."
"Why stop at 2? I want to see D’Lo, Jordan Clarkson, Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, and Devin Booker mix it up in a segment all about dating Kendall Jenner.  Also, it’s funny how Blake Griffin stands out so much in that list, but he’s only 3 years older than Clarkson."
"Zach has been training for this his entire career having to take way too many shots and carry too much by himself. There is no doubt in my mind when the playoffs come around and adversity hits or we need a bucket, he'll go get it for us.  I can't wait to see what happens this season and hopefully he can have a Devin Booker-esque moment as his first playoffs run and do some damage."
Unless Devin Booker absolutely snaps and takes yet another jump (possible) it's Utah
"Agree 👍 He proved ""I can win you a ring with my offense"" to every GM by being an absolute bucket machine in franchise defining stakes games. Even some stars disappear on the big stage (Devin Booker game 1 against LAL, anybody?) But kyrie smoked a 73-9 team when it mattered."
"Devin Booker literally set the record for most points created per touch in the 2019/20 season(points+points scored by teamates off his assists divided by number of of touches per game). Most efficient offensive season in NBA history. Best player on a finals team. 3 point champion.  Yeah, so over rated.  This sub is so low information and reactionary it's ridiculous."
"Devin Booker literally set the record for most points created per touch(points+points scored by teamates off his assists divided by number of of touches per game).  Most efficient offensive season in NBA history.  Best player on a finals team.  3 point champion.    Yeah, so over rated."
"Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, and Rudy Gobert come to mind."
"Its a crime that Devin Booker, Paul George and Kyrie made the list before him tbh"
"Devin Booker should not be on here lol  Jimmy, Kyrie and Trae are better"
"So many players on this sub go from underrated to overrated so quickly. Guys like Jrue Holiday and Devin Booker being hella overrated and being called top 20 players when they arent meanwhile a year ago they were called empty stat guys and were underrated.  Wonder who is gonna be the next person this sub does a 180 on, Lavine? Sexton?"
Devin Booker sees red when Wesley Matthews is guarding him
"lol really?  As a starter in the front court he’s not popular than  Lebron, AD, and PG.  As a reserve he’s not getting a forward spot over Jokic, Rudy, and Zion.  He’s not eligible at guard which I’m assuming is penciled in for Steph,Luka, Dame, and Chris Paul (?).   Which means (barring injuries) he’s competing for one of two spots with Russell Westbrook, Devin Booker, Ja Morant, Mitchell, Brandon Ingram, Fox, CJ, KAT, and  Draymond"
By this logic Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are superstars and Luka is not. Which is why this logic is completely garbage. He is clearly already a superstar.
Devin Booker
"Cassius Stanley is a 1 and done player from Duke entering his 2nd season. Devin Booker is coming off a Finals appearance, scored ~9,400 points and is entering his 7th season. Stanley is 22 and Booker is 24."
Cameron Johnson is older than Devin Booker by some months
Devin booker
"My homer pick is Collin Sexton. I freaking love that guy and if we trade him I’ll be devastated.  My non-homer pick is either Devin Booker or Steph Curry.   Steph is the player that got me into the NBA and inspired me to work harder. I thought basketball was just a boring old sport until I watched him go off in 2012 against the Knicks. I was in Middle School at the time and I was just amazed at his shooting. He singlehandedly inspired me to get in the gym and work on my game. I studied his jumpshot and tried to replicate every little bit of it to look like him.   Too bad we had to become rivals. I despised him after playing against him in 2015 but we’ve come full circle and he’s one of my favorite players in the league.  I like Booker because he’s who I try and play like now. His mid range and post game are so smooth. He doesn’t have a super tight handle, but he kills dudes with subtle jabs, pump fakes and little fade aways. Absolutely love his game."
Devin Booker has played against Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett
"Where the fuck do I start, lmao.  * /u/ugn_terror's comment above  * The Lakers played an injury-plagued Heat team in the 2020 finals and Heat fans don't even try to give Lakers fans the same hell Lakers fans give the Suns / everyone  * The Suns ""lucked"" into this playoff path by being the 2nd seed and then immediately facing the defending champs because the teams they played in the 2nd and 3rd rounds SHAMELESSLY tanked to avoid the Lakers  * The Lakers only took a 2-1 lead once Chris Paul couldn't shoot and was averaging 8/8/4 shooting like 33% from the field. Literally Vogel set a 1-2-2 to trap Booker leaving nobody wtihin 35 feet of Chris Paul in the corner, and it worked. Not only that, but game 2 was a 1 possession game for much of the 4th quarter without Chris Paul landing the plane.   * Nuggets, as they were, still bodied a healthy Blazers team. We knew Murray would be out since February. The entire NBA world did. Saying ""But murray would reverse a 4-0 SWEEP where every game was won by double digits or more"" is fucking hilarious.   * CP3, fully vaccinated, tested positive for COVID and missed the first 2 games of the Clippers series. ""Fully healthy.""   * Devin Booker had a hamstring sprain in game 3 of the Bucks series. CP3 had torn ligaments in his wrist he was playing through. Obviously Giannis had the horrible knee injury so I say that they even out. Regardless, it's not like the Suns were ""perfectly healthy.""   Ultimately, people just have their narratives and will take any argument to fulfill that narrative, consistency be damned. Lakers fans just like you love to do that, I'm sure you'll ""nuh-uh"" most of these with some flawed logic too."
Chris Paul (2004 Draft Class) is also older than his teammate Devin Booker (2015 Draft Class)
Cameron Johnson (2019 Draft Class) is 8 months older than his teammate Devin Booker (2015 Draft Class)
"The year is 2034. Devin Booker retires after a HoF career, two championships, one MVP. Top comment on reddit:"
I could see him being like a lite Devin Booker. Maybe average 20/4/4 on above average splits
Monty Williams was coaching a starting backcourt of Devin Booker and Chris Paul to the playoffs.  Tom Thibodeau was coaching a starting backcourt of RJ Barrett and fucking Elfrid Payton to the playoffs.  One of these things is very clearly not like the other. Give it a rest already.
Devin Booker. He really thinks he deserved to be in those finals. Do it again (don’t have to win) and I’ll agree.
"&gt;ESPN: Zion says[with alot of anger] playing for the pelicans is sickening[feels like hell]. Thinks he should be on a playoff team[or any other team]. While watching Devin Booker in Phoenix he said ""I (...) can be there this year""."
"ESPN: Zion says playing for the pelicans is sickening,  Thinks he should be on a playoff team. While Watching Devin Booker in Pheonix he said “I (…) can be there this year”"
"This is a first take type of take. If you watch the games, you can clearly see the difference between the two. Jrue abused Chris Paul and Devin Booker defensively while Bledsoe was getting cooked by the likes of Terry Rozier and Kyle Lowry (respect to Lowry but he ain't in Chris Paul's category)."
"Devin Booker : ""I'm done with not making the playoffs""   *Team goes 19-63*  Good luck Zion"
Devin booker still
"Yeah I’m sure if Devin Booker and Trae Young made All-NBA teams they’d have put the clamps on him, really slowed him down."
"The person I was originally replying called them idiots who need to shut the fuck up and do the right thing among other things. And look at literally any thread about a player who's not vaccinated. Its all insults. Hell even players who turns out are vaccinated are getting insulted if they haven't come out and confirmed they are vaccinated. Look at Devin Booker. Look at LeBron.   Its really something how each side tries to blame the other. Like I said, some of the biggest pro vax people just last year were talking about how distrustful they would be of the vaccine. And now suddenly their tune has changed. As someone who is vaccinated and recommends it, it's quite fascinating how people have handled and fumbled this whole thing"
Or just Devin Booker
"I just don't see why. The Suns just made the Finals with ancient Chris Paul, great but inconsistent Devin Booker, and young, inexperienced Ayton. If there were absolutely zero chance of winning with Embiid, the best option would be to trade him at the height of his value before he demands a trade or leaves in free agency. The team should be doing everything to win or he's gone."
"""The late great Kobe Bryant, he told Devin Booker: be legendary"""
Lonzo Ball  Devin Booker  Mikal Bridges   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Deandre Ayton
PG: Lonzo Ball $1  SG: Devin Booker $4  SF: Robert Covington $1  PF: Giannis Antetokoumpo $5  C: Karl-Anthony Towns $4
"Watching him in the playoffs, I came away thinking he was kind of inconsistent. If he could work on that and improving his scoring in general and/or work on his defense, then he could be top 15.   I have him at 20  11.Damien Lillard   12.Jayson Tatum  13.Donovan Mitchell   14.Kyrie Irving   15.Chris Paul   16.Jimmy Butler  17.Trae Young  18.Paul George   19.Zach Lavine   20.Devin Booker  21.Bradley Beal   And you could even make the case that Beal is better than him. I don’t think he’s better than anyone in the top 15 personally. Even if you think he’s better than Chris Paul, there are still the players from 16-19 that have a case to be over him."
"Nothing there came from his mouth notice the word ""allegedly"" also that came from Sullivan who has a Hard on for kyrie and kd using them for clicks ever since kd cut him off. Wouldn't be surprised if a lot of that is largely exaggerated. Even then if he's doing all that, it might be stupid but he's not publically saying anything like Bradley Beal was or Devin booker was"
I believe that with better defense and increased playmaking ability Devin Booker would crack the top 15.
"Please respect his opinion, he’s just being cautious. Would you ask his wife about the medications she’s on while pregnant? No, so don’t ask him if he believes Devin Booker has been seen at practice, we all have our opinions"
Mainly because we were missing Klay. And y'all got sonned by Devin Booker and the corpse of Chris Paul in the first round even though Lebron had AD for 5/6 games.
"These are all great, but I think that the Devin Booker example in #2 is a poor choice for this call. Any right handed player who has curled around and taken a shot going left to right knows that that right leg often will rise up higher than usual. It's just a consequence of momentum and mid-air balance. It can certainly exaggerated, but this specific example of Book committing and offensive foul looks pretty borderline to me. Yeah, that leg comes up, but it doesn't look like he egregiously exaggerated it.  This will probably be one of the toughest calls for the refs, because you can see pretty much any shooter that has to adjust for this movement is going to have some leg movement that looks ""unnatural""."
"Harden and Russ have a finals appearance each and they were on the same team with KD when they did it. CP3 also has only one finals appearance on a team with Devin Booker. AI in his prime was a perennial scoring champ and steals leader who carried a team with no discernible offensive gameplan besides “give Iverson the ball” to the Finals. He should be above them, he had a better career than any of them have so far"
Devin Booker.  James Harden.
Well this is leg kickin to draw a foul. But in my opinion what kobe did and devin booker doesnis just great shooting form and why not stave off a defender with that separation. But kickin your leg out to touch a defender and draw a foul is bs imo
To be fair at least for Suns fans people actually listen when you say Devin Booker is good now.
Devin Booker owns the Lakers
"Suggs is the first blue-chip prospect we've had since Dwight left.  Besides our two playoff years, we didn't just miss out of the playoffs either, we were straight bad (bottom 5 every year except 2016 (11th, still bad) and the playoff appearances) and then unlucky with draft slots and terrible trades by the previous FO. If you look at our drafts since Dwight, we've always moved down or stayed put and just out of reach of franchise talent.  https://i.redd.it/ncc5bvz3rx671.jpg  * 2013 - Oladipo (good pick but bad trade by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job)  * 2014 - AG - we miss out on Embiid by one pick because we move down in the draft.  * 2015 - Mario - we miss out on Porzingis by one pick * 2016 - Pick becomes Sabonis, but traded by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job * 2017 - Jonathan Isaac - good pick, but we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Fox) by one slot, again because we move down * 2018 -  Bamba - we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Trae) by one slot, again because we move down * 2019 - Chuma - Great pick * 2020 - Cole - Good pick * 2021 - We should have ended up with Scottie, again missing out on the point guard we desperately need by one pick, because we moved down...again. Toronto passing on Suggs was the first break we've caught in a long long time.  IMO it's silly to try and say retrospectively they should have drafted a Devin Booker (13th pick) or an MPJ (14th pick) or SGA (11th pick) with a 5th pick. We've simply been unlucky and haven't had any franchise talent simply fall into our laps like some of these other teams. The trades made by the previous FO deserve the criticism and Hennigan should have been canned much earlier, but it is what it is."
There aren't many things I want more in the world than a Devin Booker version of this jersey.
"I find myself in agreement with all these rules. But I'm having a problem accepting one example video. In [https://twitter.com/NBAOfficial/status/1443591762820440064](https://twitter.com/NBAOfficial/status/1443591762820440064), they say that Devin Booker is committing an offensive foul while shooting because his leg was too high. But isn't that a way to keep balance while shooting? I don't watch a lot of NBA/Suns games, so I don't know if Booker usually shoots without flailing his legs.   Your thoughts?"
"im a big fan of all of these changes except for the one regarding kicking out the leg where they used devin booker as an example  sometimes that leg just comes up as a part of the normal shooting motion, particularly when turning and shooting or even fading  i cant explain the biomechanics of it but it just happens ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
It's almost like you don't have a panic attack whenever I talk shit about another player lmfao. You think I got like 150k karma on here and they're all about devin booker? And no other team is this sensitive so I don't have to reply to them like I'm doing to you...
I'll prob get shit for this but Devin Booker is a bitch. This clip and the clip of him making fun of the dudes having a pickup game at the gym made me dislike him.
This is exactly why devin booker ain’t a top 250 player in the the league. Just doesn’t have that #mambamentality😤😤
Devin Booker
Devin Booker in shambles
"This trade actually would make sense, but Philly is so delusional they probably wouldn’t make it bc Sexton doesn’t have big time name value. That’s how misguided they are  And fans are too. You’d think people learned from Devin Booker, how a player pegged as a ‘stats on a bad team’ guy can become a “winner” overnight in the right setting and/or with the right player(s)   Sexton on the Sixers worh all those vets and Doc would be  a perfect match. You would have a roster of guys to hit 3s, D up, and do the dirty work. Then let Sexton and Embiid absolutely cook on offense.   And I’ve been following Sexton since high school. People have no idea this dude has the same things in him that Jordan, AI, Kobe, all those type guys have. No that doesn’t mean he’s as *good* as them, but he is the same type of absolute maniac with that type of will to win. He would win over Philly fans from day 1."
Yeah but did he stop Devin Booker from scoring 70 in a game he didn't play?
Zach Lavine is better than Devin Booker. Don’t @ me
2011 Enes Kanter - Tristan Thompson  2012 Kevin Murphy - Kostas Papanikolaou  2013 Shabazz Muhammad - Giannis Antetokounmpo  2014 Dante Exum - Marcus Smart  2015 Trey Lyles - Devin Booker   Just wtf
"I formally file a motion to revoke the nickname ""Book"" from Devin Booker."
Devin moron is a Booker
Devin Booker is a moron
It’s not a surprise that Devin Booker is fucking stupid. Every time I hear him talk about anything other than basketball my brain hurts. I saw him on Jimmy Fallon once and I couldn’t comprehend how he passed school
"Devin Booker ending his statement with “educate yourself, educate yourself.” after pushing this “you can still get COVID if you have the vaccine” shit is something else. Anyone that has educated themselves knows that isn’t the point. The list of dudes in the NBA that I no longer respect grows by the day."

"I like MPJ and think he will be a multiple time all star and star. Still 41 million should be for top 5 players and if it’s an clerk at should be for guys like Devin Booker, KAT, or Jayson Tatum. I don’t even think he can make the all star team this season.   Even if he is a great player, I don’t know if he can ever come close to 41 million. Maybe 30-35, but this is a huge risk and I don’t think he can come close to his full contract which is understandable, but this is going to be a lot on pressure on him to perform."
Devin Booker is way better than Kevin Love.

"&gt; Jimmy butler has the option to bring the ball up the court and create plays from the wing, which to be fair he is really good at  Agreed, I didn't want to get in to things like ""passing ability"" and ""dribbling"" because they were as unfairly slanted towards Jimmy as blocks and rebounds are to KAT so I tried to stick to universal ""skills"" to pose the question of whether a skillset is superior to an impact on winning.  Taking the same question with a more equitable comparison might be something like Devin Booker vs Zach LaVine where the skill set is relatively close so you'd probably have to give the nod to Booker right now for going to the Finals and having a bigger impact on winning."
Burden of proof isn't on me. You can't prove a negative. And what report is this? I've yet to be linked a single thing saying Devin Booker is vaccinated.
"Just like you'd think it'd be pretty obvious someone like Jaylen Brown or Devin Booker is vaccinated, but at the end of the day we don't know these people, just the persona they allow us to see."
"This is why I'm not convinced guys like Jaylen Brown or Devin Booker are vaccinated. They just won't say so which makes zero sense. And all the Suns fans keep saying ""the team said so"" but never link this confirmation. At least the Celtics fans admit they are speculating when it comes to Jaylen Brown."
Devin Booker didn’t have any supporting cast whatsoever. Beal has had all nba level teammates
"One of the symptoms of Covid, loss of taste and smell are the most noticeable. Devin Booker currently cant taste or smell."
Between this and [Devin Booker not confirming if he got Vaccinated](https://streamable.com/o1u2yp) im starting to think not all these dudes are the brightest.
yea my point is devin booker didn’t have any team success until he got a better roster around him. look at the roster beal been hooping with lol
"Its public health in that it impacts the people in his life, those he works with and interacts with on a day to day basis, they are entitled to know his vaccination status.

"I forgot about that!  &gt;The league tightened its rules before this season when it comes to matters such as tampering, salary-cap circumvention and free-agency timing -- with one emphasis being the rule prohibiting player-to-player tampering.

"In addition to past announcements regarding Chris Paul getting COVID that the entire Suns team is vaccinated, Devin has a sister with DiGeorge syndrome.  I’m willing to bet he’s vaccinated but he doesn’t want to be caught in the crosshairs of the endless vaccination debate.  **[An article from last year:](https://eu.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2020/04/09/take-seriously-suns-devin-booker-training-home-keeping-distance-during-pandemic/5123204002/)**  &gt; Mya was born with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome.  &gt;""COVID-19 could be very dangerous to people with weaker immune system, which I think a lot of people are learning at this moment now and just aren't informed with the correct information,"" continued Booker, who added he's been doing plenty of Face Time to stay in contact with family.

"Yea bro I was just on a sub where a guy was trying to say Devin Booker doesn’t have the right to keep his vax status from the public. And I was like no, actually Devin Booker will only ever be compelled  to tell certain ppl, he owes us, the public, jack shit lol. Ppl are obsessed to the point their rationale is out the window."
"Or he just doesn't want anti-vaxxers to use him as an example  Something like ""oh you see, Devin Booker was vaccinated and got Covid so vaccination obviously doesn't work""  It's happened at Croatian NT in football during Euros and at one point, every anti-vaxxer used him as example"
Yeah he would be sacrificing so much just by saying one sentence! Wow poor Devin Booker how would he have ever had a fun stream if he said “I’m vaccinated!”   Y’all are crazy.
You sound like a self entitled prick. Devin Booker will never be obligated to tell u anything about himself ever not one single day...go breath some fresh air or something and get a life lmao
"Can't believe I had to scroll this far down. Devin Booker isn't and hasn't been the #1 guy on the Suns since CP3 came to town, and that's because of his stunningly small skillset. The man is a midrange God and he's decently clutch, but has no other discernable or otherwise ""star-like"" skills. He is the reason the Suns lost what should've been an easy finals IMO."
And that reason is he’s a young player at a stacked position right? Are you of the opinion that devin Booker is a kevin love level player?
"Devin Booker is overrated, I would say he is the 6 or 7th  best shooting guard in the NBA. Whenever I watched him in the playoffs  he took some wild heavily contested shots throughout games. Although hes skilled than most players at hitting these shots, during crucial moments, I'm scared af when he takes those shots when he misses hit I cringe, but when he hits it I freak out. I'd rather see smarter shots or at least those kinds of shots at the last second, not in the third quarter."

Said it has been about a week and he'll be back in no time. He said he's straight right now and the worst part is no taste and smell. He did not want to say if he has been vaccinated or not.

yea this is just obvious and a reporter fishing for a headline.  what next they are going to ask for simmons for devin booker? When they already have a PG in paul just like nuggets have in Jokic?   Offseason headlines.
Jaylen Brown will soon be better than Devin Booker
Devin Booker is the best SG in the NBA
Klay Thompson (Booker) Isaiah Thomas (CP3) David Robinson (Ayton) Khris Middleton (Bridges) Shane Battier (Crowder)   Off the bench   Devin Harris (Payne) Doug McDermott (Johnson) Andrew Bynum (McGee) Greivis Vásquez (Shamet) Nenad Krstić (Kaminsky)  Yeah I’d say that’s a pretty good team.
Devin booker would bounce off of Lebron prime like a fly
devin booker obv
"I'd put him in the Devin Booker/Donovan Mitchell tier. Great scorer, not great at anything else but not awful either."
"shirt that says ""young socialites shoot 3s"" with a pic of Devin Booker"
[official NBA statement on Devin Booker](https://twitter.com/nbaleave/status/1415520755148861440)
That was a bit after the initial reaction - I found the threads:  * [[Highlight] Booker gets ejected from the game for something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lwlig9/highlight_booker_gets_ejected_from_the_game_for/)  then   * [[NBA Official] Pool report on Devin Booker's ejection vs the Lakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lwn9uw/nba_official_pool_report_on_devin_bookers/)  then finally  * [[Gambadoro] The magic word that got Devin Booker ejected last night vs the Lakers was b**ch](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lx5m7j/gambadoro_the_magic_word_that_got_devin_booker/)
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
"Remember last season where everyone was outraged that Devin Booker got a second T and ejected for 'complaining', without knowing what he said? And then it turned out he actually turned to the ref and called him a bitch?"

"The ole’ Devin Booker trap. Good player on a terrible, mid market team."
KD choked against Giannis in the playoffs. Steph choked against Lebron in the play ins. Jokic got swept by Devin Booker lol
"It's not because they're in the media, it's because Laker fans are known to overvalue their players to delusional levels.   I knew Laker fans that thought Kuzma was as good as Devin Booker a couple of years ago."
Devin Booker deserves a mention
"I'm disappointed Sexton isn't playing.  Ever since Devin Booker and Trae Young last year, I'm skeptical of players with good stats on bad teams that people say ""Aren't winning players.""  Kinda wondering why everyone is so down on him."
"AD remains the most unimpressive first option for a ""star"" in the current NBA and probably in the history of the NBA. Of the top 11 players, he is clearly the worst first option. Even after that, Butler, PG, Russ, Beal, CP3, Dwight, Melo (lol even Melo), Beal, Donavon Mitchell,  Kyle Lowry, Jason Tatum, Demar Derozan, Trae Young, Devin Booker and John Wall have had more success than AD as the first option.  It's fucking ridiculous that I can name 25 players with better success as a first option than a ""TOP 75"" player ever"
"This is a great read for Bulls and Warriors fans (or just Zach or Draymond fans), and Devin Booker even makes a cameo as another wine afficionado.  Some stuff I thought was great:  We drank a lot of burgundy,” Green said. “He (LaVine) had no clue. He had no idea about anything when it came to wine. And it was good just to see him start trying wine. Before you knew it, Zach was coming up to the lounge, like ‘Hey, man, we drinking some wine tonight?’ ”  LaVine returned to the States a bonafide wine drinker.  “Big time now after messing with him,” LaVine said. “I’ve been donating to the vineyards already.”  ***** “He was the best teammate you could have for a guy in our situation,” LaVine said. “He was the leader of the team. Obviously, we know KD (Kevin Durant) was the best player. But without Dray, we wouldn’t have won. He’s the one who had everything (together) in every practice, watching film with the guys, making adjustments, giving guys confidence to come and play their game and just keeping everybody engaged.  “You can really see why the Warriors are so good. He’s the glue guy. He’s the one who makes everything run. At least that’s my opinion. He looks out for everybody else before himself.”  ***** Green has been watching LaVine closely this season, equal parts proud and excited. He watches every game. He listens to his interviews. He follows how LaVine is growing his brand, even how he dresses. He can see the difference, the superstar blossoming. His demeanor. How he carries himself. Green said he even notices that LaVine walks on the court differently.  “You are becoming exactly the Zach LaVine you’re supposed to be,” Green said, “and that’s a beautiful thing.” *****  “Greatness doesn’t just happen on the floor,” Green said. “ Greatness is in how you carry yourself. Greatness is how you interview. Greatness is how people deal with you. It’s not just you can score 30 points on the basketball court. Greatness is how everybody else responds to your greatness, and if you don’t require people to respond to your greatness, they won’t.”"
"I was just about to mention this, it's kinda like a Devin Booker scenario where you add a few vets to the team, you guys get better and a lot more people really start to see who a Zach Lavine is like they did with Booker. Obviously different players, but both are Kobe disciples so both just want to hoop and get better."
It's called doing a Devin Booker. LaVine really reminds me of him in terms of career arc. Exceptional players who spent years getting disrespected for being on bad teams with little to no support.

Next Devin Booker!
"If someone gets injured before the all star game, another person who was close to being an all star takes their place, ex. Lillard last year was injured going into the All Star game so Devin Booker took his spot."
PG: Chris Paul  SG: Steph Curry  SF: Devin Booker  PF: Mikal Bridges  C:Bill Russell
"It depends.  If we're working our way through a tough, evenly fought game and it comes down to the last shot, we're solid. Between Chris Paul and Devin Booker, we've got two players that excel in taking those tough, big moment shots.  If we have, say, a 20+ point lead against an under 500 team, or a team missing two of their three all star players, its more or less a guarantee that we're going to fuck it up."
"Id like 2 dominant bigs paired up in the front court to see what it would be like, like any combination of Embiid, Jokic, Porzingis, AD, KAT, Vucevic etc would be interesting   and fill out the rest of the roster with Brogdon at PG, Beal at SG &amp; Devin Booker at SF"
**70 points or higher** * Devin Booker - 70pts **60 points or higher** * Carmelo Anthony - 62pts * Steph Curry - 62pts * James Harden - 61pts * Lebron James - 61pts * Damian Lillard - 61pts * Bradley Beal - 60pts * Klay Thompson - 60pts * Kemba Walker - 60pts **50 points or higher** * Russell Westbrook - 58pts * Kyrie Irving - 57pts * LaMarcus Aldridge - 56pts * DeMarcus Cousins - 56pts * Kevin Durant - 54pts * Fred Vanvleet - 54pts * Jimmy Butler - 53pts * Anthony Davis - 53pts * TJ Warren - 53pts * Giannis Antetokounmpo - 52pts * DeMar DeRozan - 52pts * D'Angelo Russell - 52pts * Isaiah Thomas - 52pts * John Wall - 52pts * Caris LeVert - 51pts * Kevin Love - 51pts * Khris Middleton - 51pts * Terrence Ross - 51pts * Eric Gordon - 50pts * Blake Griffin - 50pts * Nikola Jokic - 50pts * CJ McCollum - 50pts * Derrick Rose - 50pts * Lou Williams - 50pts * Trae Young - 50pts
All I know is Devin Booker got the highest. Why not.
"Honestly, it seems like you haven't watched Zion in about a year. I only say this because he has *elite* touch around the rim. He's hardly been dunking. Most of his scores are off of his incredible body control and layup finishing ability. As for the defense: most 20 year olds are awful at defense. Westbrook and Barkley sure weren't anything special on that end at any point of their careers, much less at age 20.  The empty stats narrative is played out imo. 99% of the time people are simply forming narratives about *individuals* based on team accomplishments (or lack thereof). Perfect example is Devin Booker. The Suns get CP3, Ayton develops a bit, they have a real coach instead of a coaching carousel, and the narrative vanishes despite most of the change being in his surroundings. Put Tatum on the Bulls and Lavine on the Celtics, and you'd see some narratives form around those circumstances. The narratives are *especially* unreliable with young players imo, as people rush to make takes about them."
I wonder how many guys currently have their career highs in a loss.  Devin Booker  Bradley Beal  Ben Simmons   And now Grant
"Suns  2011: 13 markieff Morris  2012: 13 Kendall Marshall  2013: 5 Alex Len  2014: 14 tj warren, 18 James ennis   2015: 13 Devin booker  2016 4 dragon bender, 13 Georgia’s papagiannis  + 2nd round pick bogdon bogdanovic traded for 8 marquess chriss  2017 4 josh Jackson  2018: 1 Deandre ayton, 16 zhaire smith  2019: 6 Jarrett culver traded for saric + 11 cam johnson   2020: 10 Jalen smith"
I’ve always liked Henry Ellison’s game. The guy just never caught a break. But Detroit ruins everything. Detroit drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. And There has to be a spot for James Young somewhere.
"Lmaoo  ""Suns players Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton played really well. Booker had 34 pts and Ayton had 21. Anthony Davis needs to do more if Lakers want to win this."""
"Devin Booker has played a SINGLE playoff game and you're calling him a top 5 player, it's a crazy overreaction"
Is this the first time this sub has ever seen Devin Booker play? Dude has been doing this for years.
Devin Booker created the Earth

Remember... Devin Booker is still undefeated in the playoffs. His win record is 100%. He's indisputably the GOAT.

"You’re kidding... right? Two time all-star Devin Armani Booker dropped 34 points, 8 assists, 7 rebounds in his first playoff game just now. What else could you ask for him to show he’s ready?"
"&gt;	and at this point it’s expected he has a bad game in the playoffs more often than not  The difference is that PG dropped his first big playoff performance 10 years ago, while Book just played his first one of his career today. By this logic, you could say that it’s expected that Devin Booker will miss the playoffs more often than the opposite"
"Replace Paul George with Devin Booker and the clippers get better, ppl won't admit it tho"

Playoff Devin Booker van touch me where he wants
I would just like to point out that Devin Booker is a good basketball player.
Devin Booker outscored AD and Bron combined lmao were absolutely fucked
"Man, people bashed these Suns, saying that they had no play-off experience, and the Suns respond by playing a fantastic Game 1, completely locked in on D, their defense and rotations were so crisp, and against the Lakers who won the title last year thanks to their defense and versatility. And Devin Booker is THE MAN! I'm looking forward to this series, it's already looking like a banger."
Patiently waiting on the “Devin booker is the best player in this series” thread lol
"lakers will really lose game 1 in a series theyre favored in and r/nba instantly rushes to their computers to post about how they're ""probably gonna lose this series"" like bruh would you be posting ""should the suns trade devin booker and chris paul for shake milton"" if the suns lost lmao"
"Also Rachel Nichols said Devin booker had the most points for Phoenix in their playoff debut, but Charles Barkley had 37pts in his playoff debut for Phoenix’s stop lying."
devin booker is the really good
What a debut playoff performance for Devin Booker
DEVIN BOOKER CAN SOLVE THE ISRAEL-PALESTINE CONFLICT
Devin Booker is good at basketball
"Devin Booker has arrived in the Playoffs. This is what us Suns fans have been waiting for!  Great to see Ayton deliver up against AD too, and the intensity and hustle of Mikal and Jae can never be underestimated  Just hope CP3 is all good!"
Devin Booker is the best basketball player of all time

Devin Booker played 45 minutes. That's not sustainable...

Devin Booker is the best basketball player of all time
Devin Booker is a fucking star
"Devin Booker went off in his playoff debut! Ayton did well too, the Suns was great all around all game even when CP3 went down  Loved the crowd energy too. AD really gotta pick it back up if they wanna win this, also where is Gasol man"
PLAYOFF DEVIN BOOKER HAS ARRIVED
Devin Booker is a bad man.  Anthony Davis got bullied tonight by Ayton.  Mikal Bridges is a stud on defense.
AD no longer a top 5 Player. Devin Booker most likely is.    Dont @ me
Devin booker is really fucking good
What a playoff debut for Devin Booker
Devin  booker u nasty

God damn I love Devin Booker
Devin booker said hold my dick
Lol Rachel's update on Chris Paul was that Devin Booker is ready for playoff defenses.
Marty Booker or Devin Booker? Debate 👇
Devin Booker has to become Kobe to win now  Even then maybe not enough
Devin Booker thinks he’s Grayson Allen
"""*2-for-1, by any means.*"" - Devin Booker"
Devin Booker
Devin Booker has also never lost a 1st round playoff series. Something's gotta give.
Not true I lived in Phoenix people give 10x more of a fuck about the Cardinals and Larry Fitzgerald than Devin Booker and Deandre Anton combined
Let’s flip it to his opponents. If this was Devin booker you know he would’ve been suspended multiple games which could have decided this series
"Trades aren't made in a vacuum. Suns already had a back court franchise player in Devin Booker and were in desperate need of a big man, so they picked the best one they could and who was projected to go in the first few places anyway, with the sky as his ceiling potential-wise.      While Luka at PG and Booker at SG would be a cheat code offensively, they would really suffer on defense, the ball wouldn't be in Luka's hands as often as it should, slowing down his development and Booker would soon feel like he was replaced as the face of the Suns. These two are young hotheaded alphas, they can only coexist if they decided to play together by themselves."
"I’m officially suspending Devin Booker from Sunday’s game, he walked by me on the street yesterday and I had a cough a few weeks ago."
The Devin Booker erasure in the ticker preview hyping Lebron vs CP3
One of the best in the league imo. That game against Phoenix he took like 4 charges from devin booker and basically took him out of the game.
Lmaooo.  [Did Devin Booker try to sabotage LeBron for the first game?](https://i.imgur.com/tfrRABx.mp4)
Devin Booker gonna get swarmed and will still be legendary
I’m expecting Devin Booker to put on a show in the playoffs. He’s a star but I expect him to really become a mainstream superstar
"We still havent gotten a Devin Booker state farm commercial, weird"
"Perfect timing to bring this up. Cause in about 2 weeks.....  Dray is wrong in hindsight, but if we don't ignore the context he was making a valid point at the time.  For what it's worth, the Suns won't win anything simply because Devin Booker is in that 15-20 range. You need a top 5 player to win championships."
"Maybe you're thinking of [this](https://sports.yahoo.com/draymond-green-fined-50-k-for-saying-devin-booker-needs-to-get-out-of-phoenix-during-tnt-studio-show-163321480.html)? I'm not sure... but perhaps he was fined because he was acting in an ""analyst"" role when he said this. Now I'm not sure I know the tampering rules lol."
"I mean, it's cause of Chris Paul, not Devin Booker. If Chris Paul was not on the team they'd be in the lottery again"
"Draymond 9 months ago, confident both Steph and Klay  would be back and healthy this season grabbed the Monkey's Paw and said  ""I wish Devin Booker will play for the best team in the Pacific Division""  His hubris made him think himself invincible from the curse, turned around and walked away as one finger from the paw curled."
"I didn't see many people disagree with Draymond back then, he was saying he wanted to see Devin Booker play on a good team so he can play his best. And now they acquired CP3 and they are a good team because of it.   What was so controversial about that?"
"didnt doubt lebron  was pretty giggly when AD was 2-14 in the first half though :D  curious how they do vs Chris paul and devin booker though, they def gotta up their game. if they play like they did vs GSW it will be a 4-0 sweep (i have no doubt playoff lebron will find it before game 4, prob much earlier)."
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29628273/draymond-green-gets-50000-tampering-fine-saying-devin-booker-leave-suns
That's exactly what Draymond said about Pheonix and Devin Booker when he got fined for tampering during the bubble lol

"If we're talking shooting, not scoring - like 4 or 5 people. Booker is a 34% three point shooter. Ingles is 45%, Mitchell is 39%, Conley is 41%, O'Neale is 39%, Niang is 43%.  Jazz are 1st in the league in 3-pointers made and 4th in 3pt percentage. Suns are 13th in 3-pointers made and 7th in 3pt percentage. Devin Booker is a high-volume midrange and iso scorer, he's never really been a knock-down shooter (has never shot over 50% from field or 38% from 3)."
It’s the way him and devin booker play. Trying their best to draw tikky takky fouls. It’s kinda disgusting
Oh empty stats? Great argument man. I thought this sub was done with that BS after Trae Young and Devin Booker.
Who on Utah is a better shooter than Devin Booker?
Devin booker cute asl

Alex Len is going to be in a playoff game before Devin Booker (by 2.5 hours). Really proves how great a pick Len was by McDonough!
"I would just turn on the TV and see which teams you like to watch. After that I believe there’s a database somewhere not sure of the link but you can look up some players.  Here’s a couple I would HIGHLY recommend watching because they are all stars and all time greats at the moment 1) LeBron James and the Lakers 2) Steph Curry and the Warriors(they will make a comeback next year) 3) Kevin Durant + Kyrie on the Nets 4) Giannis Antetokoumpo and the Bucks(he’s just fun to watch dunking too lol) 5) Some extra all stars - Westbrook, Beal, Jokic, Embid, Simmons, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell  Anyhow those are some all stars the first 3 points are hall of fame level (except Kyrie), then you can learn about each player on your favorite team.  Hope that helped"
"1. Lebron and Anthony Davis were injured for dozens of games and their record tanked - many have them coming out of the West despite the 7th seed. Suns are a very inexperienced team with their best player Devin Booker never reaching the playoffs until now and Chris Paul being notorious for having early exits  2. Not really wrong but there's only like 10 superstars imo, with 2 of them being on the Lakers. Basketball is a very player-dominated sport due to it being a 5v5  3. Idk what you mean but people say defense wins championships, and its not wrong. Most if not all of teams that got chips had amazing defense"
Devin Booker is a pissy little bitch who shoves guys out of the air and grabs ankles when things aren't going his way
If we were talking about Devin Booker
"It’s funny that a player who many had/have considered to have future star talent would say he modeled his game after Devin Booker, Steph Curry, it’s like yeah okay makes sense...then Elfrid Payton. Just funny considering how bad Elfrid is now and that a future star player was studying him for reference, and said player had a down year"
Devin Booker just happens to be playing the number one defense in the NBA and Dame is playing a team that literally doesn't defend. Great argument though.
Devin Booker is literally getting triple teamed so I'm just going to veto the third one  You're right on the other two.
MJ isn't in the 70 point club.   Yet another reason Devin Booker is better than Mike Jordan.
"Out of Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine and SGA that always get compared to each people usually say something like Murray &gt; SGA &gt; Mitchell &gt; Booker = Lavine on defense."
"Yes.  Are you not aware how much more defenders were allowed to get away with back then? On what planet is Devin Booker scoring 30 points back then, let alone 70? Tatum is not getting 50 in a game either. And James Harden would get litterally killed on the court for his antics that Windhorse and the rest of NBA shill media have to pretend is ""clever"".  A prime LeBron would struggle to average 24 ppg back then. That cute football barrage into a layup that he likes to do would end up with him on the floor each time, right on his shoulders."
Cp3 isnt the best or most important player in the suns...its devin booker...so a win wont improve his legacy by much
"Dude all these young guys are super comfortable and legit. Ja morant, Trae young, Donovan Mitchell. Devin booker is one or two classes earlier but hes finally getting the national stage to shine too"
"you guys remember devin booker had a groin strain like 3-4 years back and had to be carried off the court. He was out 2-3 weeks i believe, but not sure what grade it was"
"AD was 2/9 and took the most Lakers shots BEFORE he injured himself when he fell awkwardly... He was actually trying his best but still failed to be efficient despite being healthy enough to start the game and play 19 minutes before his injury. He had a whole first half, where he usually is able to put his imprint on the game, to assert himself...but he didn't coz the Suns played awesome defense on him.   The Suns finally figured out how to guard him basically, and I agree with Mark Jackson that the way AD was playing, he was a detriment to the team being a net negative 8 on the 19 minutes he was out there in the first half. It wasn't a dumb take at all... The numbers basically pointed to that fact.  TBH, I really wish AD is healthy and will be ready to go for Game 5, coz I want the Suns to continue proving to the world that they can defend the defending champs with two of the best players in the NBA and beat them in a first round series. Their defensive turnaround has been nothing short of a miracle, and even Devin Booker can be called a good defender now the way they have been playing in the system Monty established... Good game LA...though I wish LeBron just didn't quit on the team that last few seconds... It doesn't paint a good picture of leadership from the GOAT... go Suns!!!!"
"Maddening.    LeBron and AD need a third superstar to beat Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul?"
"Lavine isn't a bust tho. How about one Lauri Bird and one veteran Shrek man for one Devin Booker, whomst we will safely land on a good team for a PG."
devin booker has been completely nonexistent in the second half lol
Devin Booker is the third best player on this team.
Why is Devin Booker such a mediocre three point shooter? He's a great mid-range shooter and excellent free throw shooter but since that 38%/7 3PA season four years ago he hasn't reached even 35.5% once
Devin Booker IS A BUST!! Time to trade
Fuck Devin Booker play like ur an all star
Devin Booker trying very hard to lose the game!
If by Devin Booker he means Chris Paul then sure.
"He's about to get a playoff series win in his 3rd season! I guess I always felt it would be more likely he'd have a *good, but never really leading his team to the playoffs* career arc like Kemba Walker, Demarcus Cousins, Devin Booker before this year lol. Maybe I made that underestimation also because of his size."
Devin Booker needs to become a much better shooter if he wants to take the next step.
man devin booker does so much dumb shit lol
I can see why both these fan bases are touchy LeMickey and CP3 each only have about a year left before they become mere “locker room presences” and Devin Booker and ADisney are way too soft to lead a team
"You sound like a man who doesn't watch devin ""I pass up open shots to foul bait"" booker"
"Just because devin Booker exaggerates a flopping motion doesn’t mean it’s a foul, aka what’s happened most of the game for him. Your argument that the refs have favored LA so far today is complete nonsense"
Devin Booker has twice as many free throws as the lakers
Imagine watching Devin Booker flop around the court and claim he’s getting the short end of the stick officiating wise
"devin booker is a great player, but man he makes so many dumb decisions."
It’s okay for your favorite analyst to say CP3 should have been but not Devin Booker?  The only reason they won a game was because of Book   Stop the character attacks. Devin Booker’s name should have been higher in MVP talks during the season than CP3s.
Devin Booker is such a soft bitch.
Devin booker should have been in the conversation for MVP of the Suns
"he could be in the conversation if you were saying, ""Devin Booker will not be MVP."""
"Fuck is AD thinking? If you're AD and you're posting up Devin Booker, why are you passing out of that?"
Rare booker to ayton connection. Devin needs to do more of that
"Would have expected Giannis middle top. It's a good reference to game 2, but he looks a bit like Devin Booker from that angle."
"In case you still haven't realized, they purposely make these kinda things controversial, and borderline stupid, to get people to talk about them. Their ranking of the top players under 25 was also dogshit. They had Lamelo over Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell lmao."
"I’m sorry but if you think Ben Simmons is better than him I don’t know what to tell you. He’s clearly better than Devin Booker too imo. His defense is significantly more impactful than bookers offense and he’s a better offensive player than booker is a defender. Those guys you list at the bottom are mostly ridiculous. Sabonis or Morant, really?  And as for the playoffs I believe that narrative is wildly overblown. Not to mention pretty much everyone in the nba that’s been around for a while has had at least a couple bad series. Kyrie shit the bed the only time he was the best player on his team, KAT hasn’t had a good series, klay has shot 30% from the field in like 4 series and it never mattered, etc"
Devin Booker is a problem.
"Homie, before ad was injured, Devin Booker averaged   25/5/5 with 55%TS with 5 to per game.   This is genuinely bad for today's game.   And superstar players get doubled ALL the time."
"Devin this year is surrounded by an all-around great team. What was he doing before that? And I’m saying the best scorers. Don’t let this game fool you, booker is not an above average 3-point shooter. Kyrie can hit from anywhere on the court. Meaning he’s a better scorer than booker. He also averaged more points this year."
"I guess man. They had already given up. Blow devin booker for this weak ass dunk all you want, the lakers were beaten and had given up. And booker stunts on them lol. It’s just douchy."
"Hats off to the Suns. Everyone was feeling sorry for them, ""all that work to get the 2 seed just to face the defending champs in round one"", but they prevailed. All the talk about Devin Booker being a ""good stats bad team guy"" or whatever looks silly in hindsight.  That being said, those are some dirty seats and cold nachos."
"I saw Dudley be the first person to run to Booker and thought thats whats up, Dudley was the vet leader for us when Devin got here."
Wtf I love Devin Booker
"Think about it, right now, Devin Booker, from Mississippi, is in the locker room butt naked cleaning his groin so that he can go bang the Princess of LA. Doesn’t get much worse for the City of LA."
"Chris Paul, devin booker, Jae crowder, deandre Ayton had a great series. Extremely impressive play from all of them"
Devin Booker is a superstar in this league
Devin Gianis or Booker will duke out for that title. Trae Young will be the best pount guard in the league i two years.
When I go to sleep tonight ima check my closet for Devin Booker
"Devin ""The Funcooker"" Booker is officially a playoff assassin and honorary Celtic for life. Score 70 on us again next year, king!"
"but tbh, it really wasn't because of lebron that lakers had that push before he sat.   He missed looks, lakers came out of nowhere for second chance points, and devin booker forgot how to dribble a ball."
"Does fuckin LeBron have 47 points in a playoff game this season I dont fuckin think so bud. I'm fuckin tellin ya Devin Booker is dropping 100 in '21 fuckin callin it right now. Clap bombs, fuck moms, shoot, break ankles, and fuckin celly boys fuck"
Devin Booker is a problem. Flat out killer.
Remember when Stephen A said the Lakers should trade Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker? Good times
"the bookie who made these odds is getting fired:     ""Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns will score 5 or more three point field goals against the Los Angeles Lakers +2200""  shoulda put more than 10 on it"
DEVIN ARMANI BOOKER.
"Devin ""Steph Curry"" Booker won the game."
Why are you talking about your “King” like that? Devin Booker owns Lebron🤨
Devin 47 Booker
"Of the guys you listed, in my opinion, it’s not Devin Booker."
devin booker is a hot slut
"That old man just walked off after getting beat straight up and couldn't give Devin Booker his credit. Quit on his teammates, quit on his coaches, quit on the city of L.A. and then acted like LeBitch after every play. Good riddance, glad this man finally earning a first round exit and is being exposed a little more as that LeGacy starts to look a lil spotty. Bubble rings were soft, both finalists eliminated in the first round."
"Excellent series from the Suns. They showed why they were a no. 2 seed.  Devin Booker. Just no words. Absolutely amazing.  Their role players showed up and CP3 fighting through the injury and coming in moments to halt the Lakers momentum.  \_\_\_  As for the Lakers.  For starters, those boys need to rest. Like a lot. The injuries they've accumulated throughout the year is insane. Lebron's ankle. AD's knee and now groin. Caruso strained his leg. KCP hurt. It goes on.   Now thats out the way, fucking Lakers. What happened to that Lakers team that had disciplined defense irregardless of their two best players being out? They've never been consistent from range but they could always rely on their D no matter what. When they started seeing the Suns making tough shots, they fucking stopped pumping the brakes. The fuck is wrong with you guys? Wizards had more fucking heart and they were playing into their funeral?  Lack of chemistry was apparent but more than that, their effort. Kuzma, he needs to evaluate his performance this series because man, for someone who has come a long way and won a chip, he still plays like a deer in headlights.   Schroeder, ironically the dude who played with the most hustle but man, disappointing.  All in all, they have too much age on that team. I was willing to wait til this game before I said it but Lebron may not be the best player in the world anymore. And thats fine, no king rules forever. A lot of eyes will still be on him next season to see how he bounces back but the days of him playing all game and being effective is over. Their FO needs to keep that in mind this off season.   Would also like for him to fucking work on his body language. I dont give a fuck if he leaves a game before it finishes (that thread was a fucking meme, Bron's been doing that shit for years) but on the court, you gotta keep it 100. Even if you aren't playing a vet role, you're still a fucking vet. Energy is contagious in a team sport, whether its football, cricket or basketball. Your team may have played like dog but you did nothing to inspire or even help. Leadership doesn't go out the window when things aren't going your way.  I hope all the hurt and injured players recover this off season. They really need it."
Devin Booker
"DEVIN BOOKER YELLED ""THATS WHAT I THOUGHT"" AT THE LAKERS AND GOT EJECTED AFTER DROPPING 47 TO ELIMINATE THEM  NEVER FORGET THAT THIS MAN IS A BASKETBALL GOD"
Devin Booker is a killer
"Chairman LeMao hated getting chirped at by Chris Paul, Jae Crowder, Devin Booker, and the rest of the Suns after showboating Game 3. Did the Isaiah Thomas walk-off and left at 0:00's. Now he got time to push Space Jam 2 for Winnie the Pooh in Shanghai. Still Top 5 GOAT player."
I love Devin Booker and I don't care who knows
"Devin Booker is the future man, he has shown he is one of the top 3 future superstars in the NBA"
Neither has Devin booker
Never forget Devin booker scored 70 points against the Celtics and lost this kid deserves the team he has now

Devin Booker will never win an NBA championship. Not up for discussion
Cool story if LeBron was 6/7 from 3 right now it'd be a 1 point game but he's not and it's a 13 point game because Devin Booker is 8/9 from 3.  LeBron has essentially become dollar store Luka.
"there's a ton of shit in nba games that wouldn't fly in pickup games, huh? what an awful argument.   devin booker whined about fuckign double teams in pickup games. you think he's gonna complain about them in the nba? cmon now"
Don't get all the Lebron hate in here. Why wouldn't you want more opportunities to watch the greatest player since Jordan? Y'all aren't going to be telling your grandkids about Devin Booker.

Lebron is 14-0 in the first round.   Lakers have been out scored by 22 in the 1st quarter.   AD is out and not returning.   Lebron’s ankle injury seems to be lingering.   Devin Booker is killing it tonight.
Happy for Devin Booker. Let’s not forget that this dude scored 71 points in a game...
devin booker ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Devin Booker is better than Ben Simmons
"Chris Paul shouldn't have gotten votes. People say that Steve Nash was the MVP and he averaged less points so why can't Chris Paul do the same. Well Nash was the best player on his team. MVP minimum criteria should be ""best player on his team""  and in Paul's case, it was Devin Booker."
Nuggets in 5. Will Barton is our Devin Booker
"Maybe there was a big thread on this, but TIL there is a Devin Booker who plays in Europe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker_(basketball,_born_1991)"
"Eh I’d prefer starting from 2014/15. You lose John Wall Brandon Knight and Cousins, but you gain KAT Devin Booker and Julius Randle"
"Because I don't share your knee-jerk reaction to Phoenix winning the first game in a second round series?  Look, I think Phoenix is a very nice team and a very fun story. Devin Booker is the real fucking deal, he is already phenomal and when age really starts to catch up to the current-guard of NBA elite (Kawhi, Lebron, KD, Steph, Harden) I think Booker will be a top-4 player with Luka, Trae and Jokic. However, I don't think they have a championship squad as it stands, and I don't think that changes when they simply run it back next year with the same squad.   Could Phoenix come out of the West? I mean it wouldn't break the laws of physics, but I don't think it's likely. They still have to win 3 more games against Denver, and then the next series against the Jazz or Clippers is going to be an uphill series for them. But sure, they *could* win, but they are going to have play exceptional basketball and have a lot of things going their way. And even if this happens, what difference does it make? Brooklyn is top dawg right now, and the Suns simply don't have the fire-power to go toe-to-toe with those guys. How does that change next year? You would basically need two of the Nets big three to get hurt for the Suns to compete, and that's just not likely"
"pat bev pissed off okc, lakers, russ fans, and dame. like every basketball player with chip on their shoulder he talks to hype himself up. he isnt garbage and at the same time he isnt the best. and he is now our own mr glass/streetclothes  peak of the fuck gsw days i hated on dray and kd but i still liked their team for klay curry livingston iggy and kerr. hating on teams over one person is a bit overrated.    devin booker for case he is way too cocky and started shit talking pg earlier this season for no reason even after pg dropped 39 on him and 36. do i hate the suns lol no they have mostly likeable people beside devin."
"&gt; I’ve never seen a player so confidently put up 20+ shots a game while legitimately looking like a great value version of Kevin Knox. This man is butchering ball movement, is taking early shot clock contested iso shots, and can’t hit the broad side of the barn. Khris Middleton in this series is averaging more attempts per game than Kawhi Leonard, Devin Booker, Kyrie, and PG... while shooting over 20% less TS%. This man is getting paid a max contract.  Middleton scored 22 PPG on 64% TS in the first round. He's scored 21 PPG on 60% TS over the past two seasons.  Chill out over 2 games."
"Of course Bridges is gonna be more efficient when he’s playing off CP3, Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton. OG playing off of Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, has to create way more for himself."
Don't leave out Devin Booker! He's only 24 and has had some incredible performances in his career already.
"Pure point guard just refers to a true playmaker.  Somebody who is looking to get everybody invoked and make plays for others most of the time, but can also get their own shot.  Somebody averaging above 7 assists per game is what I think.  CP3 is a 10 apg type of guy.  A non-traditional PG is Kyrie Irving or Damian Lillard who looks to score first and pass second.  CP3 looks to pass first and then he turns it on to score in crunch time in the 4th.  He’s not the teams main scoring threat all game, that would be Devin Booker."
"Zion has post moves so he'll be fine.    His biggest concern (like Devin Booker until this year) is actually making it in the playoffs. But once he's in, I'm not worried at all about his game."
I wonder if girls are still licking his car?  [one article that talks about it. ](https://kentuckysportsradio.com/basketball-2/devin-booker-talks-about-girls-licking-his-car-music-and-more/)
"Shaq, Dwyane Wade in 2006 was not a great shooter but he still had to shoot all those free throws and did pretty well lol, and Greek Freak I do believe can lead a team to a championship, however it's like whoever it was on one of these Sports shows said, he is a Shaq who needs a Kobe, if Giannis had a Devin Booker/ Kyrie Irving type as his second option, obviously with a solid team around him that could be a title Contender right there"
Tatum has also dropped a 50 point playoff win against the Nets and also dropped 60 in a comeback win from down 32 points. Devin Booker Stat padded at the end of a blowout LOSS to hit 70 points. Those are very different whether you like it or not
devin “the donk” booker 😎
Donovan Mitchell Devin Booker Trae Young Jayson Tatum
"He's had one year of better scoring, and that came after Book let Paul take the reins this season. Devin is still a better playmaker and has higher IQ on both sides of the court. I feel like there's a reason that HOF's praise Booker and want to play with him despite him being in the league for a year less than LaVine."
Well there’s no worse star than Devin “empty calories” Booker so…
I wanted to punch him in the face after he asked Devin Booker if getting doubled team while playing pickup in the summer helped prepare him to play the Lakers and their #1 defense in the playoffs
"If not next game, Joker is gonna give y’all some of Mama’s Cookin’ when they get back to Denver. Fortunately, you have an all-time great scorer in Devin Booker, and the point god himself to feed him. Should be fun."
I want y’all to take it aswell I love cp3 and devin booker is becoming my fav
Devin Booker.
"I have to imagine Luka would do pretty well with Devin Booker and CP3 at his side, though."
"**This year**  Paul George: 23-**5**\-**6** on 46/**40**/86. *VORP* = **2.6** *BPM*: **3.7**  Devin Booker: **25**\-4-4 on **48**/34/86. *VORP:* 1.1 *BPM* \- 0.1  **Last 5 Years**  Paul George: 24-4-**6** on 44/**40**/85. *VORP* = **18.7** *BPM*: **4.3**  Devin Booker: **25**\-**5**\-4 on **45**/35/**87**. *VORP*: 6.9 *BPM* = 0.3  The stats show Booker is a slightly better scorer and is a better facilitator.  George has much better defensive metrics, rebounds more, and shoots better from 3 on more attempts."
"He played like 23 minutes and 26 minutes if I remember correctly games 2 and 3. Last year for the OKC thunder he averaged over 20ppg in the playoffs and this year he didn't even average double digit in ppg. Obviously he does more than scoring but I think that scoring puts a quantitative perspective in how hurt he was. Before game 4, he asked the rest of the team including Devin Booker and Jae to tell him if he is playing like trash and he will sit, even if it is only 2 minutes into the game."
devin booker t
Devin Booker should be the mvp instead of Jokic
Wins over Lebron:  Paul George: 0  Devin Booker: 1
"Credit to James Jones for assembling a good team. Credit to Monty Williams for managing this team. Credit to Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton for leading the charge.  Suns in 6."
"Devin Booker, Klay Thompson, and Squidward's house all need to form their own super team."
"Devin Booker, better playoff performer"
Devin Booker is MJ 😂😂😂
Devin Booker can score anyway he wants
"Is Devin Booker actually good, though?"
Is Devin Booker bad on defense ? Gordon has been attacking him the whole game
Feeels like Devin Booker shouldn't be guarding Aaron Gordon.
PG: D’Angelo Russell  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Cam Johnson (he’s probably a PF but who cares)  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Matt Bonner
I hate the suns eliminated my Lakers but when I worked at COX Devin Booker called in and was a super cool dude. I’m so conflicted
Michael Porter Jr and Devin Booker look like twins on the court
devin booker looks like a metapod man smh
The Devin Booker head raise. Classic.
Aaron Gordon sonned Devin Booker who sonned the Lakers  Aaron Gordon&gt;Lakers
"As long as teams hunt Devin Booker on defense, I can't take the Kobe comparisons seriously."
not surprised devin booker plays like this the second that he faces a team in the playoffs whos best player isn't injured
Does Devin Booker have a herpes outbreak on his bottom lip tonight?
"Everytime I put a suns game on, my first thought is ""Devin Booker looks like a mii"""
Devin Booker is sneaky fast
"Devin Booker ran out of ups lol, I thought that was a dunk"
"Suns fans, imagine no Devin Booker and making it this far. That is Nugglyfe with no Murray"
DEVIN BOOKER IS A SUPERSTAR
Poor Austin Rivers.  To go from guarding Dame to Devin Booker
Devin Booker is fun  I'm on the Suns bandwagon now
Devin Booker man GOLLY
"Part of it is Dallas just doesn't have a real 2nd option. It's masked a bit because Luka can shoulder that burden really well.  Like if the Mavs have someone besides him who can run an nba offense he probably doesn't score 35 per game, but they also probably win this series.  I think he definitely has the BBIQ to coexist beautifully with a Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker type scoring guard with playmaking skills. Someone to play off of who can also effectively run the offense while he takes breaks."
devin booker swims laps at the ymca i go to and i’m always telling him “im wet like i’m book” and he just laughs and signs his autograph on my buttcheeks in the locker room cuz my dick is too small for his handwriting oh well
Never forget that Devin Booker wasn’t given minutes during clutch time in a final four game
i got:  austin rivers OVER 9.5  &amp;  devin booker OVER 29.5
"Just got off war zone with devin booker, expect a masterclass from him tonight"
"Thibs did more with less than the Suns did. Suns roster was stacked compared to the Knicks. Devin booker +  possibly the greatest point guard of all time, that's a one two punch combo that the knicks don't come even close to having."
Devin Booker is definitely the greatest Mexican nba player ever. He fits Phx so well. Lol
"Because the suns have Devin booker who is better than any player on the bulls and the bulls are not going to add one of the greatest point guards of all time to their roster next year.  Deandre Ayton was the first pick in the draft for a reason, he's still coming along but he is showing signs of a player who can be one of the best centers in the game.  You think the bulls are going to make a huge jump, but who's going to do it?  You can fantasize all you want but you need to have some realistic reasons if you're going to make a post about it.  Trae is a better player than anyone on the bulls and they have solid pieces at every position.  The Knicks have good defence and a coach who is defensively gifted.  There is no reason to expect the bulls to make a significant leap even with everything you mentioned, they will still have sizeable holes in their roster."
"That's ""old injury prone Chris Paul"" ""#1 bust DeAndre Ayton"" and ""empty stats Devin Booker"" to you."
Monty also has CP3 and Devin Booker. Not saying Monty isn't deserving but Thibs did a LOT with a pretty bad roster with no superstar players. It was the biggest season-to-season win percentage turnaround in Knicks franchise history.
"&gt; Ayton only averages 2.8 personal fouls this season, but against the Nuggets he’s totaled three, three and six fouls this season.  I'm pretty sure you wrote it this way to be intentionally misleading but yeah so he went from his season average of 3 fouls to 4 fouls? Given his success guarding Jokic 1 v 1, if Ayton stays out of foul trouble for two of every three games the Suns are winning in 6 easily.   Nuggets also played one of those regular-season games without Booker and another was the OT loss the night before in which he got injured in. In that game Jamal Murray traveled before hitting a game-tying three that went uncalled.   A shocker, the Suns were not very good without Devin Booker and followed up the Nuggets games with a loss to the Thunder. At that point the offense was still struggling to gel and they were 8-8. They have gone 47-15 since then.    Taking away anything from those games as a future predictor is really dumb idea. This whole post screams ""I am very smart"" but without having actually watching the games lol   One more thing Cleaning the Glass can tell you is since April 1, the Suns have had the best offense in the NBA."
"The Knicks don’t have anyone as good as Chris Paul, Ayton or devin booker. Come on now."
"Monty’s case was hurt by how good the team was IMO. It’s harder to give credit to the coach when you have guys like Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and especially Chris Paul on your team.   Meanwhile, the Knicks had the largest leap in season W/L % in the league while barely changing their roster. It’s just harder to argue against that compared to Monty’s case.   I wouldn’t have been mad if Monty got it given the sophisticated style the Suns play and the way he motivated that team to excel this year. Really got the best out of his roster and would have deserved the award."
Devin Booker is better than anyone on the Knicks. DeAndre Ayton would start. Stop it
0 Devin Booker highlights  0 Chris Paul 3s 0 Jae Crowder 3s
"It might be Devin Booker, the only clear cut best player of an elite team that basically get no credit for it because the media love CP3 so much"
"imo, they should really go with some of the young up-and-coming stars like Ja, Zion, Tatum, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Bam, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, and other young guys.   Of course, if it's Dame Time and he wants to play, he should play too, but I have a feeling some of the young guys who have never been to the Olympics before would be more likely to go and play hard.   But goddamn, imagine watching Zion and Bam dunking lobs from Trae and Ja... good stuff"
"Me, Zach Lowe, Suns fans have been screaming Devin Booker for 3 years on this very subject. Glad he’s getting recognized now"
idgaf zach lavine is every bit as good as devin booker and nothing will change my mind about that.
Just like Kuzma and picks for Devin Booker
"Luka puts up great stats in a loss - r/nba: Oh dear, oh dear gorgeous  Trae Young and Devin Booker putting up great stats in a loss - r/nba: you fucking donkey"
Stop fucking doubling him!  -Devin Booker
"Tyler Herro is an elite scoring talent, it's like saying Devin Booker or Zach Lavine can't be your #1 scorer on a championship level team."
So Zion’s stats don’t matter because they were regular season? So was Trae Young and Devin Booker just empty stats guys before?
"hes way better than most give him credit for.  If you replaced Devin Booker with Lavine, the Suns would still be in the second round where theyre at right now"
then Devin Armani Booker entered the chat
"&gt;The Clips guard/wing starters are Jackson/PG/Kawhi if you want to try hide him on Morris Sr. — he’ll go off.  &amp;#x200B;  I mean I said Reggie. I don't think that's a bad option. Clint will be in the paint and if we lose to Reggie stepbacks then so be it lol. Do you really think the Clippers are going to run the offense through Morris? Even if they did, we could send help on the back down and force him to make a decision to pass out like you pointed out. Something he's not used to.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;CP3 would cook him. Booker would cook him. Mikal moves off the ball well enough to where Trae would have to actually participate in the defense. Crowder can back him down pretty easily.  &amp;#x200B;  I was told that Danny Green moved off the ball well enough to where Trae would have to participate, but that didn't really ever become an issue. Not something I'm worried about. Anyway, Crowder is the most likely matchup I believe and again, if they want the offense with Chris Paul and Devin Booker to be run out of the post with Crowder, then I honestly see that as a win for the hawks. Clint will be there to help and we have a scheme in place to handle it just like you pointed out."
I think it depends on scope. I think y’all conflate people “shitting” on someone needlessly with speaking on their career during ranking conversations.   I’m not gonna call Bron a bum for his mediocre performance (by GOAT candidates) here. However when we talk about all time players and their careers we have to speak on it.   The same way you hear “Jordan was 1-9 without Pippen” you’re gonna have to hear “Bron got clapped by Devin Booker and Chris Paul”.
Chapter 3: Devin Booker. Final chapter: Nets
"Kinda funny seeing Luka above Jordan, Ja Morant above Allen Iverson, Devin Booker above KD, Donovan Mitchell above Steph Curry. Maybe let's wait for a larger sample size?"
"By Steph? Sure. Steph will cook anybody. However, Rudy is one of the best iso defenders against guards in the league.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/  “For the 2020-21 season, opponent possessions featuring an isolation with Gobert as the primary defender have yielded 0.779 points per chance. That’s fourth-lowest in the NBA among 66 players who have defended at least 125 isolations, per Second Spectrum data, trailing only Draymond Green, Richaun Holmes and Julius Randle — and a big improvement from earlier in Gobert’s career.   A half-decade-old viral clip of Steph Curry turning a younger Gobert around off the dribble has shown remarkable staying power; once or twice a game, some unsuspecting young guard gets Gobert on a switch and assumes it’s easy pickings, only to be rudely awakened to the reality.  Smarter offenses eschew the iso against Gobert, generally in favor of attempting to stretch him out utilizing modern spacing and shooting themes. A ball-handler who can pull up for three, a stretch big man or even both simultaneously can force contortions away from the Jazz’s preferred drop-big defense.  He’s improved here too, though, both in terms of effectiveness and willingness. Today’s Gobert will often play up higher in pick and rolls against known pullup aficionados like Damian Lillard or Devin Booker — but he also has the mobility to recover all the way back to the rim and put out any fires this increased floor space creates.”  Your narrative is way outdated."
Guarantee that the people booing this play because he fouled instead of letting PG dunk are the same people who booed Devin Booker for dunking at the end of the Suns game
I think there's at least a small connection because strength makes you less likely to slow down if bumped or something like that. Basically Luka or Harden are going to be able to pick a speed and not slow down at all easier than say Devin Booker.
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
"I mean, let's be real here. Kidd doesn't want the job. The Dame thing is \*very\* convenient if you want a way to say no but you don't want to have to make it clear that you think the Blazers are going no where any time soon with their roster. He doesn't want to be tied to an organization that's nearing the end of a prosperous time and is almost certainly going to have to enter a rebuilding phase within the next few years in a small market.  Switch the Blazers out for the Nuggets or the Suns and I guarantee Kidd doesn't give a shit if Jamal Murray or Devin Booker publicly calls for him to be their next coach."
Maybe people should wait until a player has a good team around him before saying he's empty stats lol. Same thing with Devin Booker.
"Played against his own father too, Devin Armani Booker"
"See: Devin Booker game 6  /s of course, but Devin dropped 22 in the first quarter just like MPJ"
Bradley Beal  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Zach LaVine  Jaylen Brown (count him as a SF though)
Pretty much anyone drafted to the Suns by Ryan McDonough not named Devin Booker or Deandre Ayton.
1: Devin Booker  2: Bradley Beal  3: Spida  4: Jaylen   5: Brown      99: Trash ass Ben Simmons
"This is the actual truth, but people are incapable of admitting. This is the same guy that averaged 35/8/5/1/2 on 70% TS in the 2017 NBA Finals, but people still refused to call him the best because he had a stacked team.  KD is averaging 30/7/4 on 65% TS in the playoffs since 2017, for reference LeBron averages 30/9/8 on 63% TS, but has missed the playoffs once and has been eliminated in the first round this year.  People will never give KD his due credit because of the teams he has played in, but the reality is that he was the only player that had outplayed LeBron in a playoff series in over a decade before Devin Booker did so this year."
Devin Booker also
Devin Booker ? Kawhi ?
"Kevin Love gets so disrespected its funny. Same with every star Lebron has ever played with other than D-wade. Kevin Love was considered a borderline top ten player in the league at his peak. Dude was averaging 26 and 12 on the wolves. And before you hit me with bad team empty stats argument, people said the same about Devin Booker. and look at him now. Kevin Love had post ups and touches pretty much stripped away from him when he joined the Cavs, and was turned into a spot up shooter.   Every all-star big other than AD that Lebron has ever played with have made major sacrifices to accommodate Lebron and people like you want to downplay their previous accomplishments when they don't put up the same numbers they used to put up because they were forced to play in a system tailored for Lebron and because it makes Lebron look better.  I'm not trying comparing the 1995 magic and 2018 warriors. You're the one trying to shoehorn the warriors in the conversation when we're discussing teams that they actually beat. Also, the 1995 Magic are the only team who can say they Beat MJ Bulls in their prime.  Yeah, Lebron should get most of the praise because he was the best player on the floor but everyone wants to act like he beat the warriors by himself. Kyrie outplayed the warrior's best player in a h2h matchup and he's just an afterthought.  But yeah, Lebron gets all the praise when he wins and his teammates get all the blame when he loses, it's par for the course at this point."
"You simpering dipshit, if Jokic loses to Phoenix then what? Is Devin booker now the best player in the league? You have literally no argument other than Lebron lost in the first round and Jokic didn't. You can't even say Jokic winning the MVP makes him the better player because the regular season is ""meaningless"". Only the stupidest YouTube-comment-ass NBA fans don't understand how injuries affect the game. So stupid and shortsighted, how do you manage to not fall flat on your face every time you blink?"
LeBron went in the back and was taking pictures with Devin Booker. Y’all are so soft it’s unreal that this bothers you lmao. Mind you I absolutely hate James Harden.
"Chris Paul, Devin Booker, PG, Kawhi, (Trey Young or Embiid), and Giannis. They don’t know what they’re talking about, probably only think the NBA is made of Lebron and the Nets super team."
&gt;.  You forgot that at the end of your autistic screeching. Also it’s Devin Booker.  Capitalization is important.
I SAID DEVIN BOOKER IS A LITTLE PRETTY PRINCESS BITCH
Over the Chris Paul and Devin booker suns? No way
"Sad that a lineup of Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Giannis, Middleton and Trae Young is considered a “nightmare scenario.” The NBA really needs to figure out how to market small markets, the NFL doesn’t seem to struggle with it on nearly the same level. Shit, just this year they had Tampa Bay vs Green Bay and that was one of the most hyped matchups of the year. (yes I know they both have elite quarterbacks, but the point stands; the NFL found a way to make a game with 2 of the smallest markets in the league incredibly hyped up) Edit: words"
"you know, i think devin booker is pretty underrated"
Immovable object vs. unstoppable force vs. [Finals Devin Booker](https://streamable.com/vh05by)
Pretty sure Devin Booker is currently the one resisting the Kardashian curse
Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton were great at holding down the fort against LA tho so I just went with the talent edge of Kawhi
"People are acting like beating half the lakers/nuggets crowns the suns already. CP3 isn’t there and Devin booker isn’t as good as playoff luka/Mitchell. Ayton will be an interesting wrinkle tho, but I imagine they’re just going to go small ball again and keep it rolling. In these big games it’s about the role players and the way I see it the jazz role players are better."
"No im saying on an All NBA team period. I would put him over Chris Paul too, I think people under rate what Devin Booker has done this season and while I think CP3 has helped for sure, Devin Booker is having an amazing year himself and I think you have to credit Mitchell more considering how much of the load he carries offensively as well being the vocal leader on the team. Also, looking at the lists, Luka wouldnt have even been first team if they counted Lebron as a guard which he has been most of the time. Now you show me where Luka has won more in both the playoff and regular season while being the best player on his team. You cant and you got so pressed about it you started saying I hate white people."
What happened last year in okc and what happened last year with Devin Booker in Phoenix?
Additionally the stars and starters generally play more minutes in the playoffs. For example Devin Booker played 33.9 minutes per game in the regular season. In the playoffs he's played 39.9 minutes per game. 6 extra minutes of Booker is a big boost for the offense.
"If you can't notice the racism on ESPN when they talk about the NBA then I don't know what to say.  Every black player is Stephen A's BRUTHA MR. DOMINATION SUPA STA while Luka and Jokic are ""a'ight.""  Let's see who are Stephen A's ""THIS BRUTHA IS SPECIAL FUTURE OF THE NBA.""  Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, etc... no Luka, no Jokic.  The mere fact Jokic wasn't a 100/100 first team All NBAer says it all as well.  Who voted him 2nd team?"
"I'm an old head..... the days of Magic, Bird, Michael. But watching these playoffs, I'm certain the game is in good hands. The play of Morant, Luka, Trae, Terance Mann, Donovan and Devin Booker have all but solidified the league for years to come. Thank You."
High volume scorers on good efficiency are not empty stats players.  After Devin Booker everyone should see that
Why leave out Devin booker if you are going to include Trae young?
You should be thankful for him. Look how he has inspired Devin Booker
Devin Booker hasn't even MADE the playoffs until this season. Not all guys are wired to just pack up and quit when faced with adversity.
Except Devin Booker...
Devin booker owns the lakers
Right?  Then we can change his name to Devin 'the One' Booker.  Or 'kardashi-slayer'.  Something.
That couldn't be Devin Booker
Devin Booker he is so underrated. He’s well on his way to being one of the best in the league!
Devin Booker is the most disrespected player in the NBA
Won't stop Lakers fans from thinking they could've traded him for Devin Booker.
"Booker is better than Tatum. I don’t care how many Boston fans are on this sub and come to downvote me, Devin Booker is the better player, and that’s why he is going to the western conference finals after defeating LEBRON."
"Devin Booker is the best player on a team that beat the defending champs and swept the mvp, jaylen brown is the second best player on a 7th seed"
Devin Booker has good size
In 59 years the Suns with Devin Booker the 3rd will win their 7th straight championship against the England bulldogs.
Devin Booker gets that call
I mean Devin booker is great but didn’t lead his team to a playoff series win his rookie year
"I read ""Devin Booker has committed..."" and then the Reddit app crashed. I don't know why but i was scared for like 2 or 3 seconds"
Booker decided against playing for team USA one season and Bill Simmons called him [out](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/09/devin-booker-had-an-excellent-response-to-bill-simmons-criticism).
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker?
Devin Booker fucking around and playing the whole year.
&gt;leaving him for Devin Booker  Who in the world wouldn't lol
"Give him a break, he's still just a young rookie. Probably still thinking about Kendell Jenner leaving him for Devin Booker, he can't concentrate"
"I first saw the notification and only saw ""Phoenix Suns All-Star guard Devin Booker has..."" before it cut off. I was relieved when the tweet ended with committing to the Olympic team instead of some bad injury news or something."
"Uhm, Devin Booker is 24. Him having a negative narrative about his career is news to me...?  &amp;#x200B;  That being said, Beal is the most talented, Lavine and KAT have the most upside. More than likely tho, the answer is someone else entirely because of who these players play for."
Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Ja Morant  Lamelo Ball  De'Aaron Fox
Wasn't it Kuzma and 2nd for Devin Booker last year?
I can name another free agent if wants me to   Devin Booker seems decent alongside the Joker
Devin Booker is in a different tier than Paul George?

Devin booker is paul george’s dad. Suns in 4.
"These analytic Reddit nerds aren’t going to like it but it’s true, all the best players in the league can score from the mid range with ease. Even the young promising players like Luka, Trae, Devin booker, Tatum all have great midrange game"
Devin Booker giving this fan tickets &amp; a jersey isn’t going to suddenly turn people violent and increase fan violence in stadiums. Relax.  All it did was rally the fan base even more by acknowledging it.  They’ll show the guy on the big screen next game. Everyone will cheer. His 15min will be up. And we’ll all move on. You can find the next thing you want to get upset about.
Chris Paul and Devin Booker imo. CP showed he was washed and DB showed he can't lead a franchise.
"I can confidently say that for the series, the Lebron we got looked pretty damn healthy, catching lobs off the backboard with his head at the rim. AD for the 3 games we got him, 2/3 were dominant free throw shooting performances.   And at the end of the day, Devin Booker was easily the best player in the entire series. Maybe that doesn't happen if the Lakers are fully healthy. We can only let the teams play whoever is in front of them. Talking about what-ifs just screams salt.  Also, the fact that none of the Lakers players stepped up in the absence of AD despite more looks and shots shows how poorly constructed the roster was. Or how poorly coached, whichever. That's not an indictment on the stars, unless you want to go by your definition of ""the best stars elevate a group of role players into a championship"", where even a 75-80% lebron couldn't do that for Kuzma, KCP, Schroder, Caruso, Matthews."
Devin booker and CP3 would like a word
"Except he didn't raise their level of play, they just played well. Shai was significantly better this year than last year, he was just naturally improving, same with Lu Dort. These aren't guys who fell off post-CP3.   The only person you could argue was a result of him would be Schroder having a career year, but you could also just say that was luck considering LeBron is also known for getting the most out of guys and Schroder still wasn't as good. On top of the fact that Schroder and Paul frequently weren't even on the floor together.   Heck, even this year, Devin Booker was putting up higher volume on better efficiency before CP3 got there.   Even if you want to operate on that ""making players better"" narrative, Bogi just had the best year of his career after joining Trae, and Capela put up a year not far off his Houston #'s with Harden, who was known as the best in the NBA at manufacturing big man production."
Devin Booker is in there.
awwwww - Devin booker
I mean if devin booker asks for tickets there’s not much the NBA can do to stop an NBA player for getting tickets to his own game
"Dear NBA Talking Heads and Hyper Sensitive Non-Fans on Social Media:  Literally nobody is condoning violence. We rallied behind a dude that was sucker punched and stood his ground before letting out an absolutely legendary one-liner that, no doubt, had a significant influence to our fanbase and team.  If you want to be upset, be upset at the dipshit coward thugs that started this in the first place by dumping beer on the Sun's fan before throwing a sucker punch that, thankfully, didn't connect. If that punch hit, Mr. Suns fan, who was just having a good time and was being friendly to everyone around him, would have been significantly injured.  Shout out to Devin Booker and the team for recognizing the full context of what happened and giving this dude some well-deserved attention. He literally took more than a reasonable amount of shit before standing his ground. This is how you deal with people like the assholes that started this shit.  Stop being so damn sensitive. Suns fans aren't going to start seeking violence for clout. Leave that shit to Lakers fans."
"When Phoenix sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing beer. They’re bringing cardboard cutouts of Devin Booker. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."
"Devin Booker spent the first 5 years on a team that wasn't competitive, had a revolving door when it came to head coaches, and a roster filled with G-league level talent.  I appreciate him more and more everyday for staying patient and staying loyal."
This is amazing and Devin Booker is one of my favorite players now   Suns in 4
"I understand what you're saying, but it's not the point I'm making.  Suns guy got a beer poured on him, then after things de-escalated Nuggets guy punched him unaware in the back of the head and a fight happened. We all agree on this, and that situation does not make the Suns guy seem overly unreasonable. Maybe a few more punches than was necessary, but generally we get it.  The problem is that it's not ridiculous to say that there are sports fans who take minor things (being jostled, being made fun of etc) as a big fucking deal and want to start a fight about it. And maybe some of them might be *more likely* to start that fight if they think they're like Suns guy and Devin Booker wants them to stand up for themselves in a way that involves fighting the other fan that 'started it'."
"Oh i agree that Pels fans have all the reason to be mad. Idk, I feel like Zion might not physically last in the league that long, so him and his are probably trying to maximize everything asap. Why be Devin Booker or AD? His team needs to swing for the fences now i feel"
"What criticism have you actually pointed out?   So far, all I see is he only has 3 moves, which is hilariously dumb and shallow for multiple reasons, and that one half where his team shot under 30% from the floor he only had 2 assists.   Wow, such a strong argument, you really levied on some very legitimate criticism and showed your understanding of the player and how much of the hawks you have watched.   I get it - before these playoffs, we've been on national TV only 5 times in Traes career.  It's easy to just look at box scores, go with the r/nba prevailing circlejerk of the time which was ""bust"" followed by ""empty stats guy""  then ""foul merchant with no skills"", or listen to the Simmons and Rusillos  of the world who also watched little of the hawks and would spew the same things.   We can't watch every game from every player. I haven't watched a ton of the suns before this, but im also not going to spew a bunch of ignorant dumbass opinions about Devin Booker and act like I know better lol. It's easy to admit when you're wrong, and even easier to just not say anything when you don't know what you are talking about"
Devin Booker would like a word
"Input: throw punches Output: get free shit from devin booker.   No updates available at this time, although I’ve contacted the vendor and they might have a patch out later this year."
Suck it up   Look how long it took for the Suns to build around Devin Booker and now they’re in the WCF   Building a competitive team around a star takes time. You don’t get to complain basically 1 year in
"Makes me all the more thankful that the Suns have Devin Booker.  They made A LOT of dumb moves, a lot of personnel mistakes, changed coaches several times but he stuck with the franchise and never demanded out, though he probably could have done so easily."
"It's been like two seasons, look how long Devin Booker had to wait."
"He’s probably watching the Grizzlies, Hawks, &amp; Knicks (who drafted right after him) in the playoffs with their draft picks on good teams already making noise in the post season. Zion’s up there with the best up and coming guys like Luka, Tatum etc. but won’t get the chance to show with the current group of guys around him. Zion wanted to stay another year at Duke originally because he wanted to win the Natty. I think his money will be straight regardless but the kid wants to win. Griffin’s plan for sustainable success has had mixed results, good being that Jaxson Hayes looks like a good piece for the future, along with Nickeil, maybe Kira but keeping Bledsoe around, signing Adams to an extension, which i wasn’t too opposed to at the time but his health is questionable and he doesn’t really defend the rim. With the assets we have, the FO can put together some things right now, maybe not a superstar or another all star but some guys that could get us into the playoffs. He doesn’t want to suck for 5 years like Devin Booker had to go through."
He’s basically the next devin booker. It might also be team fit. You take Trae off the hawks and I bet they still could make the playoffs with Nate as a coach. You take Luka and Zion off and those teams are bottom feeders.
Starts don't always tell the story. A lot of people were saying Devin Booker was an empty stats guy but once he got decent pieces around him they started to turn it around. And I'm not talking about this here if you look at last year after DeAndre Eaton came back from his suspension the sons were above .500 . Now look at Brandon Ingram who puts up pretty similar stats to Devin Booker but had a monster in the paint and Zion Williamson who I'm sure most people would say is better than DeAndre Eaton and a decent point guard in Lonzo ball and they where the 11th seed...
"&gt; It's easy to be loyal when you have success with your team.  tell that to all the guys from 1950 through about 2014, who played on teams that either stunk or couldn't get over the hump, but still went out and earned their paycheck. shit tell it to devin booker, it was barely more than a year a go that every suns post-game thread had dozens of, *""book needs to get his ass out of phx asap"" comments"
"""Why date Ben Simmons when you can date Devin Booker?""   -Kendall Jenner (probably)"
"there's a miniscule sliver of difference between good organizations and bad organizations when the measuring stick is success. Devin Booker is happy now and the Suns may be on their way to the finals, does that make the Suns a good organization? No it doesnt. They got lucky too. The Lakers missed the playoffs for multiple years in a row yet everyone called pelinka a genius after they won the chip and now after a summer of bad moves those people are real quiet."
"I think we can actually thank the perception of devin booker as not an all-star caliber player, but more an empty stats player for that. The media didn't give him the expectation that he was going to be a great player so they attributed the front offices' problems to him as well. Of course you'll get the Draymond Greens and the Stephen As and the Amin Elhassans and the Rachel Nicholses of the world trying to ""Get Booker Out of Phoenix ASAP"" but everyone else? They thought he was part of the poison in the well, and that just made his bond to Phoenix stronger."
Devin Booker will be finals MVP  Ben Simmons will be a 75%+ FT and 30%+ 3pt shooter next season
"even when we were bad, we never got exposes on how much devin booker hates his team's management"
"I think younger players are starting to get tired of being really good and then being underrated or straight disrespected for not making the playoffs or winning a series. Your team is a prime example of this, Devin Booker getting snubbed constantly because he couldn't drag  Alex Len and Isaiah Canaan to the playoffs."
Homie is getting the Devin Booker experience. 5 different head coaches in 5 years
Some girl blew like 8 suns players in a row in a hotel room. Apparently devin booker was first in line. Star privilege ya know
Devin Booker is fine
So Devin Booker is better than James Harden and Deandre Ayton is better than Anthony Davis. Got it
Devin Booker is good at basketball
I feel PG's pain. Missing both FTs when you are up with a few seconds left in the game. A Devin Booker buzzer beater 3 is the only thing that it needs for it to be pretty much the same situation Grayson Allen went through.
raja bell &gt; devin booker
"Devin Booker trick y’all, man, like he playing offence. He don’t score, man. He just running around, losing the ball."
I’m starting to think Devin Booker fucked one of the refs’ wives...
"I know no one wants to hear it, but Pat Beverley has pretty much owned Devin Booker tonight. Feels weird to even type, but it’s true."
someone post the Devin Booker copypasta about throwing his lambo key in his bag
devin booker &gt; kevin martin
Devin Booker is gonna be real good for a real long time
James Harden would've chucked at three. Devin Booker is the mid-range King
devin booker &gt; james harden
Devin Booker welcome to your Kodak moment
DEVIN “EMPTY STATS” BOOKER
Devin Booker plays better with a broken nose than Patrick Beverly does with two good ones
I can't wait to pass on the next Devin Booker in this upcoming draft for the next Aaron Gordon.
DEVIN MF BOOKER
Devin Booker looks nothing like a first time all star
devin booker &gt; ben simmons
DEVIN BOOKER WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
DEVIN BOOKER
I love this guy Devin Booker
#devin Booker the hero
How braindead do you have to be think that Devin Booker didn't foul PG there?
Devin Booker is disgustingly good
Devin Booker broken nose game
"DEVIN BOOKER IS LIKE THAT, A BIG FUCK YOU TO SCOTT FOSTER"
Can we give a little credit to Patrick Beverley?. That face guading of Devin Booker has taken him out of the game
Devin Booker!! That was fast lol
devin booker is devin booker. not kobe
Devin Booker is having a tough night
"Man, Devin Booker is such a problem on offense that he has 3 offensive fouls and a broken fucking nose....."
Devin Booker really drops bombs then goes home to Kendall Jenner
Devin Booker caught in 4K drooling
This is old Devin Booker with his turnovers
We were all here on this night: The game where Devin Booker went from Al Pacino handsome to Robert De Niro handsome
Devin “James Harden” Booker
Devin “The Nose” Booker
I see Devin Booker is taken inspo from Nash with that broken nose lmao
Devin Booker will fully transition into Kobe’s prodigy with a face mask for the rest of the playoffs. Thank you Bev.
"Noted foul magnet, Devin Booker"
Pat Bev: “Devin Booker…. YOU’RE NEXT!”
How do you confuse Devin Booker for a player who's not even at the game
Dashing Devin Booker
"Devin ""Literally Jesus Christ"" Booker."
"Old school NBA (Patrick Beverley): whacks noses with opposing player, keeps playing with the expression of ""huh? what?""  New school NBA (Devin Booker): whacks noses with opposing player, falls as if shot, stays on ground for several minutes"
"Devin ""Steve Nash"" Booker"
Devin Booker a whole faucet wtf
Steve Nash bloody nose game 🤝 Devin Booker bloody nose game
Wouldn't mind seeing devin booker in a lakers uniform next year
Devin Booker fucked Scott Fosters wife and daughter
Devin Booker looks like Kyrie vs the Bucks in 2019
Because Devin Booker is playing like Dookie Booker to balance out a Pandemic P performance
Devin Booker looks old and young at the same damn time.
Only reason Devin Booker didn't score more than 70 against us is because they had Jimmer. He has been even better since that game.
"Yes.  And hell, who's to say that Cunningham, Mobley, and the other guys available in the lottery don't flame out and where OKC lands ends up being a guy like Devin Booker."
&gt; Thunder Dan was a good player but he couldn't stop Jordan.   ....and do you think Devin Booker could?
Fax. The amount of people saying Devin Booker is the best player on the suns is ridiculous.
"Just in case anyone forgot, this game reminded everyone that Chris Paul is the reason the Suns are where they are, not Devin Booker lol."
Payne looking like Devin Booker tonight.
Who needs devin booker when you have Cameron payne
"Cameron ""Devin ""Kobe Bryant"" Booker"" Payne"
Tbf everyone could use Devin Booker haha
Devin Booker looks like Asian George Bush.
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12. Seth Curry 13. Pascal Siakam 14. Fred VanVleet 15. Zach Lavine 16. Nikola Vucevic 17. Jarret Allen 18. Colin Sexton 19. Jerami Grant 20. Domantas Sabonis 21. Malcom Brogdon 22.

Suns are going to win it all and Devin Booker will be the next big superstar. I love it.
"Devin Booker is gonna lead the Suns to the Finals in his first year in the playoffs, something that James Harden was not able to do in 8 years in Houston."
Sixers could use Devin Booker....
*Cameron Payne stats*     Shows Devin Booker
Uh oh drop coverage against Devin Booker  Uh oh boring refball shit call against a star player
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Pascal Siakam  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Paul George  Karl-Anthony Towns  Klay Thompson  Trae Young  Zach Lavine  Bam Adebayo  Kyle Lowry  Jamal Murray  Domantas Sabonis  Russell Westbrook  Demar DeRozan  Julius Randle  Rudy Gobert  Ja Morant  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  Chris Paul  Draymond Green  That's 37 that I would rather have on a playoff team than Ben Simmons and I could definitely add more
Does Devin Booker have a kid?
So how long until they ask Devin Booker “would you say CP3 has been a good father figure for you?”
If Devin Booker sucked at basketball he'd be the GOAT no question
"And that man,  is devin booker."
"If Devin Booker was bad at basketball, would you guys still think he was a top player?"
I'm excited for some Devin Booker supremacy tonight. No CP3? No Problem. Time to watch the Suns get a close but decisive win tonight.
Devin Booker went insane in the second half of the 3rd quarter through the 4th.
Someone in Phoenix have a remote job opportunity for me?   My cover letter: Devin Booker is the next Kobe.  I think that is sufficient.
"i mean that's actually how it does work...look at how much more respect r/nba gives to Devin Booker...what changed? He has a team that's 100x better than the team he had like 3-4 years ago.   Of course proving yourself in the playoffs is important, but it's not like he became that much of a better player than the lst 2-3 years, he actually has a good team around him.  If you win a ring that's all that matters. Kawhi is a 2x Finals MVP. Does it matter the 1st time he won it, it was one of the most well rounded teams ever? Or does it matter his 2nd FMVP was against a Warriors team without Klay/KD with also one of the best supporting casts (Lowry, Siakam, Ibaka, Gasol, FVV)?"
Oh I know you must ***hate*** Devin Booker lmao
"It’s the reason Utah didn’t take Devin Booker in 2015! It’s very real, and definitely sucks for some teams certain years"
"It's also a legacy thing. A gold medal or two is a major boost to your HoF resume. Players like Devin Booker and Jayson Tatum are definitely considering that.  That plus a gold medal is something you get to share with everyone else on Earth who are quite literally the best at what they do. Winning an NBA championship means you're the best in the world, but getting to own a gold medal you get to stand next to someone who's the best skier or shotputter too."
Devin Booker would love that
"All NBA teams are voted on by the media. They are all focused on the current/old faces. That’s why CP3 made the All NBA second team, averaging 16/9and Devin Booker is yet to sniff one, averaging 25/4/4...  Wait until next season. He will be all over promotional material."
"Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Giannas, Leonard, George, Trae Young apparently don’t exist."
You're right about the mediocrity trap in the East. That's why the Sixers had to resort to extreme measures during the process whilst Suns kept getting shots at top picks even though they had Devin Booker when they'd be a playoff contender in the East.
Devin Booker&gt; Ben Simmons any day
"""So Team USA has got all times greats like Kevin Durant and James Harden, exciting young players like Devin Booker and Jayson Tatum, and...Kevin Love."""
I about lost it when he proclaimed Devin Booker the next Kobe Bryant after making his first WCF's.
Yeah the devin booker thumbnail is great
From the thumbnail it seems Devin Booker is perplexed by this
"Unfortunately you're going down against a Suns team that is superb even without Chris Paul, while Devin Booker is torching your behinds."
"The fact thybulle will actually shoot it means teams won’t sag off 12 feet and double embiid. Ben doesn’t give you this at all.   So far, you suggest CJ is a trash playmaker and also he isn’t very good at scoring because he settles for midrange attempts. You mention KD as a superior midrange guy (44% at 3-10ft and 46% at 10-16ft)  Whereas CJ is 43% at 3-10 and 50% at 10-16 ft which btw is peak midrange.  KD excels at the basket in the 72% + 0-3 ft.   So, actually CJ is better than KD at midrange. Or at least on par. CJ shots 40% from 3 and 50 from the field despite not being the greatest scorer at the hoop, youll find he passes or should be encouraged to pass out of this position to open perimeter players, something Dame has the luxury of.  You’re speaking out of your ass about the blazers, norm Powell went there and despite having 4 more minutes per game and leaving a complete wreck health wise raptors team had the same assists per game. The blazers don’t have players who create for others, that responsibility falls on Dame and CJ. CJ doesn’t create good looks but Melo, Roco, Nurkic etc Offensive games literally are about being setup by another player soemthing CJ did with a very low turnover rate.   I’ve listed guys who are sgs but play with ball heavy hog players. Devin Booker was one such example of a guy who despite developing more this year had his time with the ball setting up others reduced by CP3, did he have an off year? No, and neither does CJ when dame controls the ball. You don’t need more than half a season to know how a team and guy plays. 500 games is 6+ full seasons. You don’t get that. You don’t need it. There’s a 30 game sample of CJ without  Dame and Dame games without CJ. They all point to the same thing.  Same shit happens to Fred van vleet when lowry is out.   You completely ignored Beal assist totals tanking with Westbrook, how Shais went up with a worse team when Paul left.   I already mentioned kyries assists largely comes through the backs of an elite offense which inflates his assists. He’s not a great playmaker, kind of gets blinders.   Like I said CJ without dame 7 assists a game. Like Booker. With? 4.7 on low turnovers. (1.4) Like the assists to turnover ratio is elite tier. CJs game is literally the pick and roll and choosing what the defense gives him. He’s been a pg all his life till the growth spurt and honestly still is a pg who happens to have an elite one.   Prove to me that High usage pgs don’t dramatically affect their combo guards assist numbers. Then you have proven me wrong. Give me your me example. What CJ does despite Dame is elite."
TIL Simmons is older then Devin Booker. I woulda swore Simmons was younger.
"He was wrong about Devin Booker only because hee was injured and unfit to play in the team. Booker should've played if he was healthy, and I agreed with Simmons' reasons for it. Being around world class players and coaches 24/7 is worth every second you're there."
Why not just trade Kuzma and maybe a pick for Devin Booker?
Devin Booker looks like a guy wearing a Devin Booker mask.
Devin Booker too
Devin Booker wrote this post
"Bill Simmons had made the same case for Devin Booker and was clearly wrong about him. Also, there’s a huge difference between playing with the best and playing with the rest."
"Our game manager was injured against the Lakers. We BLEW OUT the injured Nuggets, so it stands to reason we would beat the healthy Nuggets. Devin Booker just had a 40 POINT triple double and we won with Paul out again. We are not without our own setbacks in these playoffs. STFU with the “only here bc of injuries” bullshit."
"Devin Booker, this season had really made me appreciate the midrange game. Him and CP3 during Game 4 against the Nuggets was just beautiful."
That’s literally the only reason I’m glad I close a Josh Jackson jersey over a Devin Booker jersey 3 years ago 😭
Trae is on his way to having that Devin Booker Conference Finals arc
"these conference finals have been a good reminder of don't react to a one game sample  no, Devin Booker is not Kobe  no, Trae Young is not Steph"
Weird in game 2 that same thing was called off of Devin Booker.
Aside from Stephen a smith. People can’t really believe Devin Booker is the next kobe
"My mom knows Devin Booker only by his Kardashian status, has no idea about how good he is as a player."
Chris Paul is Derek Fisher. Devin Booker is Kobe Bryant. And DeAndre Ayton is Andrew Bynum without injuries.
Chris Paul is Derek Fisher. Devin Booker is Kobe Bryant. And DeAndre Ayton is Andrew Bynum without injuries.
I was pretty confident in Devin Booker not being that good and Trae Young being a net negative player.  Is there any player you guys want me to doubt for next season so they can explode in the playoffs and make me look stupid?
"For the record Luka is taller(6ft8 vs 6ft6), has a bigger wingspan(7ft2 vs 6ft8), and weights about 20ish pounds more than Booker(230 vs 206).   Meanwhile Pat Bev is listed as 6ft1 and 180lbs with a 6ft7 wingspan.   Pat was giving up nearly a foot and 40lbs to Luka and that whole series was getting owned solely on size. Luka was literally backing down into the paint and turning around and dropping it in.   Devin is a much better match up for Beverly bc although he's shorter his reach allows him to bother Devin **A LOT** more. It'll be interesting to see how Monty changes it up to give him more space to work because the last 2 games he's been very effective against him."
Hell those people would probably know Devin Booker before Steph because he dates a Kardashian
"How do you account for outside influence. Like my friends, who don't watch the NBA, know who Devin Booker is because he dates a Kardashian?  Like should he be on the 3rd tier?"
"And to be fair, unlike Devin Booker I doubt he can be better than Jordan. But I also doubt we've seen his ceiling."
"If Devin Booker is getting this as an explanation, it definitely applies to Curry."
"If Kawhi was back and 100%, it'd be a different story but the Suns aren't going to have CP3 and Devin Booker shooting a combined 10/40 every night.  The Suns are still the favorites imo"
So how does he intentionally and with malice of forethought bonk heads with Devin Booker?
"Harden is playing a different role on the Nets than he did on the Rockets. Being disingenuous doesn’t help your argument, only weakens it.  Luka and Devin, and for that matter Harden, have all been the far and away primary scorers on their respective teams at one point or another.   In those instances Harden&gt;&gt;Luka&gt;Booker.   it is what it is, stop trying to be a strawman. Luka’s the better scorer."
Mike Breen is so good. Marv would have thought that was Devin Booker and called it a dunk.
"And it gives him an unfair advantage but also disadvantages him! Plus don't forget it's extremely important that all the rules are always enforced to the letter abruptly unless it's lane violations or the 3 second rule which are fine because *they* don't give any advantage unlike Giannis FT routine which, by the way, he would hit more if he didn't do it. Y'all see that out of bounds call on Devin Booker? What a terrible call, everyone knows that's not what the spirit of the rule is and why are they suddenly changing how it's officiatied? Frankly I hate that the refs are now whistling everything - except they should call more violations on Giannis FTs they make him shoot better apart for when they make him shoot worse. It's like those bullshit jumping-into-the-defender-draw-a-foul calls that slow down the game (not as much as 2 seconds per Giannis FT though) - it'd be unfair to call those suddenly differently now in the playoffs so I'm glad they've given warning to teams that coming into the next season they'll officiate them differently so that players have a chance to adapt. Not as unwatchable as the FT man taking too long though - they should really call the violations they clearly help him and he would shoot better if he was quicker."
Pretty sure devin booker has been doing that most of the playoffs.
"Devin ""Joe Biden"" Booker"
Devin Booker ain’t gonna be a superstar. He doesn’t have that skillset to get there. A superstar can create a good shot for his team at will at any point in the game. Devin Booker creates TOs and bad shot selections for himself in crunch time very often.
"I'm just saying we throw around labels like ""clamped"" and ""locked up"" only based on the results. Guys like Ben Simmons, Capela, PJ Tucker, Pat Bev, etc: they play great defense every night. But the offensive superstars? They get paid the big money to hit shots in spite of great defense. Pat Bev did his job last night, Booker didn't. If Booker drops 40 the next game that's still not Beverly's fault though, he's probably playing just as good defense but with a guy like Booker he'll only stay quiet for so long. That's why I'm also not rushing to give him too much credit for Booker's bad performance. You can clamp a guy like Julius Randle, the Hawks did it for the entire first round. You can't really clamp Devin Booker."
"[Mike Prada on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MikePradaNBA/status/1408268764886482950?s=20):  &gt;Bev is well-equipped to guard Booker b/c he hits first. Devin wants to speed into the play, stop, hit you, then pivot off you. You disrupt that by getting into him early, and that's what Bev does.    (This is also why Luka fried him. His move cadence is the inverse of Book's)"

I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Clippers vs Suns game when i heard gunshots ringing inside my house. At first I was confused but then It turns out the sound was just CP3 and Devin Booker bricks clanging off the rim again. KEEP IT DOWN YOU TWO!
Devin “Kobe Bryant” Booker. 37% shooting on 25/66 shooting   “Pandemic P” 38% on 29/75 shooting. The narrative here is hilarious.
"Yeah, Devin Booker is only a half-minute less per game, Suns series just haven't been as long."
&gt; PG is losing his legs earlier and earlier each game  He has played 653 minutes this post season 129 more than the second place in Devin Booker.
"here's what I will say for Jordan as someone who was alive (albeit a kid, born in 85) when he played.  MJ was a singular force and was by far the best &amp; most popular athlete of that era.  Contrary to what many believe, he did not play against milkmen, there were tons of legends in the 80s &amp; 90s that are all-time players that Jordan went against, and he subjugated them all.  MJ was head &amp; shoulders above the rest of his peers in a way that LeBron hasn't been in his career.  It's up for debate when LeBron passed Kobe, a lot of people say 2012, and for 3 seasons LeBron was the undisputed best player in the world until Curry &amp; KD came along (and then Harden, and Kawhi, and Giannis, and now Luka).  Once MJ passed Bird &amp; Magic there was nobody else even remotely in his stratosphere for an entire decade.  By the 90s, MJ was so far ahead of everyone else and so dominant that he was inevitable in a way that LeBron hasn't been.     As a kid, you KNEW the Bulls were going to win, it was a question of when, not if.  Jordan redefined the sport and is still influencing &amp; impacting the game today.  When you see Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum &amp; others, they're all doing a Kobe impression, and Kobe was doing a Jordan impression.  Jordan was the best offensive player AND the best defensive player in the NBA at his peak, and his statistics are absolutely bananas in a vacuum and doubly so when considering the era he played in.  Regardless of whether you consider stats, career achievements, influence on the game or really anything else, MJ is it.  I recommend that anyone who is able to finds a copy of *Playing For Keeps* by David Halberstam to get the most complete Jordan experience, cannot recommend that book highly enough."
It's like Devin Booker became a different player after Pat Bev broke his nose.
&gt; Rip is also one of Booker's favorite players ever. Said he tried to model his game off of RIP and Kobe  Is Devin Booker me but with much better basketball skill?
"I think they've solved Devin Booker, but there's a lot more to the Suns than Devin Booker. I think the Suns can exploit the Deandre Ayton vs whoever matchup a lot more."
"Booker is 6'4.5 without shoes so probably 6'6 at least on the court.  https://valleyofthesuns.com/2019/09/28/nba-requires-phoenix-suns-submit-non-inflated-heights/  &gt; ... the NBA sent a memo to the Phoenix Suns and all NBA teams requiring them to submit the **accurate height without shoes for all players** on their roster.  &gt; ... superstar Devin Booker (listed 6’6″, measured 6’4.5″)."
They gotta draft James Bouknight he's gonna be the next Zach Lavine/Devin Booker style player who's a late lottery steal
Knee contusion sounds rough. Aka bruise. Devin Booker has an entire face contusion.
"Devin Booker is the next Monta Ellis. There, I'm already more right than SAS."
That direct pass to Devin Booker was some quarterback not seeing the cornerback type of shit.
"1) people in the comments that day were saying the group was antagonizing them before it happened. Suns fans were saying this.  2) the Suns fans were surrounding them in the video, you can see them moving the group to take their back side  3) you have clearly never been jumped, if you know it’s going to happen the best decision you can make is to swing first. This is beneficial for various reasons but isn’t the only possible response   Now do I think the clippers fans could’ve disengaged and walked away, yeah I don’t think the group would have acted on it. But the part that annoys me is that the group was shouting “Suns in four part 2.” They are letting everyone know their intention and their motivation yet everyone wants to act like the Suns giving fame to a guy who got in a fight is normal.  You point out that we don’t know what happened before the fight but we also don’t know what happened before the fight with the jazz fans. Booker literally shouts this dude out on social media when this guy could be any type of person who said any type of shit before the altercation and now he’s sponsored by the Phoenix Suns and Devin Booker.  Y’all arent acting like rational adults and it’s weird to me. Just like Suns fans chirping off about injuries not being a factor. Which ironically I also got called soft by a Suns fan last series when I pointed out injuries are a fact of basketball life. Just weird energy coming out of the Suns fandom lately"
yeah well you cant blame Devin Booker for not being Darth Vader incarnate
devin booker refers to pat bev as father now
"Devin Booker tricked y'all man, he's just chucking around"

I think people are overestimating the impact a rusty Chris Paul and a broken nose Devin Booker can make.
Devin Booker up there

Will Devin Booker even win a playoff game in the rest of his career? I think he’s a choker now. Worse than Ben Simmons? - r/nba
Devin booker is young and his nose was broken. He is inconsistent for now. Hopefully he becomes much more consistent with playoff experience.
Ya not like there wasn't a bunch of questionable calls on Devin Booker to keep LA in it only for the Suns to overcome those odds and finish anyways.
"Suns fans after game 2:  This series is over, CP3 is coming back, Kawhi isn't and Booker isn't going to shoot 5 of 20 again.  The next game:  Devin Booker 5/21 CP3 4/19"
Ya not like there wasn't a bunch of questionable calls on Devin Booker to keep LA in it only for the Suns to overcome those odds and finish anyways.
Devin Booker gotta step it up or its over

Fuck Devin Booker

James Harden gets that foul 10/10. Devin Booker gets no respect from the referees
Devin Booker looks like Michael Myers
Cant count out the suns with devin booker and cp3 going into the 4th
Insane defensive effort here by Devin Booker
"Cry more lmfao. Our best player is out, another starter is on one leg, and Devin Booker is 4-15. But yea. It’s the refs."
"Yes, Pat Bev intentionally bumped himself into Devin Booker and made himself bleed."
"I really want the clippers to get swept but Devin Booker struggling makes me happy that we'll see less of those ""Masked whoever the fuck is a beast bro"" dumbass posts"
Come on Devin Booker. Don't let Patrick Beverley punk you
Devin Booker has been absolutely atrocious man. Just can’t no show like this
Devin Booker: *tries to defend*   Refs: *…and we took that personally*
patrick beverly is locking down devin booker lmao
devin booker is really getting boxed by patrick beverly damn
Devin Booker is Devin Booker news tonight at 7.
FUN FACT DEVIN BOOKER HATES BOOKS
"He might be. He averaged 24 points on 57 TS%, which is pretty good.  I'm not going to just write off guys in bad situations. Devin Booker was considered an empty stats player last year and now he's going to the finals. Trae Young was considered an empty stats player 3 months ago, and now he's also going to the finals."
suns are really leading with chris paul and devin booker combining for 1-13 shooting lmao
Devin Booker and Trae young are my two least favorite players in the entire nba and there's a shot they meet in the finals. My Salt levels off the charts right now.
"I was having a nice nap on my couch during the 1st quarter of the Clippers, Suns game when I was suddenly awoken by gunshots on my television! I was confused at first but then I realized that the noise was just DEVIN BOOKER bricks bouncing off the rim! Keep it down DEVIN!"
Devin Booker is about to lose me sooooooo much money 🥲
Devin Booker fucked the basket's wife too?
How the fuck is Devin Booker called for a foul in game 2 and Paul George isn't called for that?
Devin Booker developed   They hit on the right picks with Ayton and Bridges   They signed a good veteran in Jae Crowder  They signed Payne who understood his role   They traded for Chris Paul
1. Draft Devin Booker  2. Draft Ayton 3. Fleece the Sixers 4. Get veteran presence in CP3 5. Sign a criminally underrated coach 6. Use cap space to sign solid role players   Profit.
"I’m not sure if Monty Williams and CP3 are executing some master plan knowing they’ll win the series regardless and just letting CP3 take control of 20/24 seconds of every shot just to either kick out or shoot bricks as a form of getting re-acclimated to the NBA after 10 days but if they’re not, they need to seriously adjust. The Clippers are so well coached and can shoot the lights out. The Suns are running out of offensive options here considering they won’t feed Ayton the ball, Devin Booker is streaky and CP3 has turned into kuzma"
Reporter : how was the energy on the clippers bench??   Me: it was crazy asl the whole bench rocking we fought hard and WERE GONNA F*** DEVIN BOOKER IN THE PU*** !!

It’s actually comical how badly Devin Booker started to suck once people started calling him Kobe 2.0 🤦🏽‍♂️
"Devin booker is looking good out there. Missed his last 10 shots, but maybe 11 times the charm huh?"
devin booker probably averages close to 50 a game vs the sixers so like pick any game
People started calling Devin Booker the second coming of Kobe and he immediately started choking for 3 straight games 🤦🏽‍♂️ that’s why you shouldn’t over react in the moment
it’s honestly embarrassing how the suns don’t dish to ayton he rarely ever has less than 50% fg yet devin booker taking 20 shots when Ayton doesn’t even have much of an obstacle. come on man.
Fuck Crowder Fuck Chris Paul and fuck Devin Booker
Devin Booker made a 'business decision' from 30 ft - not sure I've seen that before.
Devin Booker with the quietest 31 points I've ever seen

Chris Paul and Devin Booker woke up and decided to brick every single Mid range jumper today huh
Devin Booker is a little baby and the refs are powdering his tender ass.
Devin booker getting all the soft calls right now lol

What's up with this Devin Booker dudes face? ( new to basketball)
Well I guess now we know who Marcus Morris Jr is...Devin Booker
Booker T doing the spin-a-rooni might be a better defensive strategy compared to whatever Devin Booker is doing out there.
Devin booker is getting abused

Fun fact Terrance Mann and Devin Booker were born 12 days apart.
Imagine a life where Devin Booker isn’t on your team   Couldn’t be me
Lmao there was this long ass segment on ESPN about how Kobe told Devin Booker to be legendary    And as soon as they come back SAS says “if I know one thing…. It’s that he has not been legend at all”   Smith is a troll
"KD, Dame Lillard, Zach Lavine, Brad Beal and Devin Booker don’t do it for you?"
Devin Booker and Trae Young. Can you picture a team with either of those guys ever winning a playoff series?
Devin Armani Booker-Jenner III has the 2082 All Star game MVP on lock
Steve Kerr Steph Kerr  Paul George George Paul  Lebron James Lejon Brames  Devin Booker Devon Booker  Demarcus Cousins LaMarcus Cousins  LaMarcus Aldrige DeMarcus Aldridge  Pat Bev Fat Bev  Rajon Rondo Rayjawn Rondo  Ernie Johnson Bernie Johnson  Kenny Smith Jenny Smith   Trae Young Swae Young   John Collins Juan Collins  Kevin Huerter Devin Huerter  Cameron Payne Cam'ron Payne  Obi Toppin Tobi Toppin
"Would this lead to teams tanking or fighting to get a specific playoff spot in the hopes of nabbing that player they want at the end of round one? You raise a good point about the Hawks only ending up with Rose/Randle.   One of the things that gets missed in thought experiments like this - fun as they may be - is how to incorporate a new player into your defensive and offensive schemes quickly so as to not disrupt what helped you win the last series. But it's really tough to pass up the prospects have having a top 5 or 10 player in the league added to your roster.  Jazz v Grizz (1 v 8) - Take Ja Morant   Suns v Lakers (2 v 7) - Take Lebron (pray he holds up or doesn't end up brawling with Crowder in practice)   Nuggets v Blaze (3 v 6) - Take Dame   Clippers v Mavs (4 v 5) - Take Luka  Sixers v Wiz (1 v 8) - take Beal   Nets v Cs (2 v 7) - take Tatum   Bucks v Heat (3 v 6) - This is so bloody tough. Don't want Butler because he can't shoot. Don't want Bam even though his D is great - he can't shoot or create for himself. I can't believe I'm saying this - Duncan Robinson   Hawks v Knicks (4 v 5) - Take Rose (6th man, keep in Trae's ear)  Jazz v Clippers - Closer but the Clips prevail. Take    Suns v Nuggets - Nuggets take Devin Booker from the Suns in a close series - yes, I'm aware the Suns have Lebron. It becomes too many cooks in the kitchen with Dame, Joker, and Lebron. Save yourself the headache and take the hot hand.  Sixers v Hawks - I think the funk of the Process can't be solved by Bradley Beal. Hawks. Take Matisse Thybulle for his sick defense and not needing to run a lot of plays for him.   Nets v Bucks - Nets win with two guns. Take the Freak.  Nuggets v Clippers - Nuggets rip the Clips. Take Rondo to put in as your closer, 2nd team general. Keep your Playoff P away from me!  Nets v Hawks - I think this series would be really close. But I think the Nets prevail. Take Giannis.  Nuggets v Nets - Close series. But I think the Nuggets would squeak this one out. Do they get to take KD for game one of the 2021-22 season?"
"People see his 18ppg a couple years ago and think he's good  He is literally what these kids call empty stats, he's the one not Trae Young or Devin Booker  He's at best a 6th man, will win you some games but getting hot and lose you a lot of games by being a chucker"
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker were much bigger snubs than Tatum.
"I iant saying Okoro is the next Kawhi, but as a 19 year old kid he guarded literally every single All-Star night in and night out and held most of them to well below average scoring and play.    https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2021/04/isaac-okoro-undaunted-after-defending-gauntlet-of-nba-stars-including-stephen-curry.html   “But Isaac makes you beat him. He doesn’t give you angles, he doesn’t go for steals and get out of position. He makes you have to score over the top of him, and I thought he did a great job of that in the first half for sure.”  Harden’s attempts to get past or around the stout Okoro were to no avail, so much that he didn’t even take a shot until a minute and 25 seconds into the second quarter.   “It was impressive from the young fella,” said Taurean Prince, who scored a season-high 17 points in his Cavs debut. “Usually you see guys kinda get happy feet guarding those caliber of players, but he was staying solid and sticking to his principles. Definitely stuck to the game plan. He definitely looked well-prepared and focused out there, and that’s truly all you can ask (for) out of the young guy.”  Of course, Harden is not going to be held down for very long. He found some success in the second-half and overtime periods, and ended up dropping 21 points (along with recording his third consecutive triple-double for the Nets). With that said, when you look at the shots he made, he didn't actually score on Okoro until the 3:28 mark in the fourth quarter.  https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/nba-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-isaac-okoro-swarms-james-harden-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-kevin-durant-defense  Pre All-Star break, a span of time consisting of 31 games, Okoro averaged a mere 8.1 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists. Not exactly encouraging numbers for a top five pick averaging 33.2 minutes a game up to that point.  Post All-Star break, the rook has scored at a rate of 10.6 points per game, adding 3.4 rebounds and is still dishing out just 1.9 assists. What’s more? Okoro is having a great month of May as through seven games, he is posting about 16.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists.  “Ice,” as he is often referred to, showcased exactly what he is capable of in a May 4 matchup against the Phoenix Suns (currently the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference) in which he exploded for a career-high 32 points while defending two of the game’s best in Chris Paul and Devin Booker.  He did a bit of everything offensively as he hit 10-of-16 of his field goal attempts and shot three-of-four from three-point range while also going nine-of-nine from the free throw line.  https://kingjamesgospel.com/2021/05/14/cleveland-cavaliers-should-isaac-okoro-make-one-all-rookie-teams/"
If only he could carry a team through the playoffs like Devin Booker
"And Michael wouldn't be in the goat conversations without Pippen. That's a fact. Pippen took on the responsibility to get rebounds, get teammates involved, score, and defend the best player. Jordan could do some of that, not at Pippen's level but he was such a gifted scorer and had the flashy plays so he got all the attention.  For example, take a look at Suns vs Clippers game 4. Booker played poorly, shot 8/22, but still scored 25 pts, 2 Reb,  2 STL, 0 AST, and 5 TO. DeAndre Ayton shot 8/14, scored 19 pts, 22 reb, 3 AST, 4 blk, 1 STL. But all headlines said Devin Booker's 25pts lead Suns past Clippers. That's a garbage headline. Ayton was the most valuable but mainstream media didn't give him that credit.  Imagine that happening during your whole career!"
I saw a tweet about how even when Devin Booker scores 20 in a half but CP3 fans still have to act like Chris Paul saved the entire state of Arizona

Devin Booker
"Elite ball handling guards and wings from 2009 to 2019: Harden, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Luka, Trae, Dame, beal, Steph, Khris Middleton, devin booker, Jamal Murray, Ja Morant. There are twelve all-star level guards in eleven years. If we just take the top half that is Harden, Steph, Beal, Luka, Trae, and Dame which is six in eleven years or about one every other year."
"Trae's hair, Luka's bitching and Ayton's custom Devin Booker T-shirt"
"Already top 5 guard? What are you smoking?  1. You're wrong, if he was an all time guard in the making he would be way more consistent at this point, its not like he is a rookie. Both Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are way more consistent than him.  2. I think Ben Simmons imploding on the Phillies, or Raptors getting a Kawhi rental and winning a quick chip easily proves that you trade for the best player when you can."
Trae Young needs a better haircut if he’s gonna pick up Kylie when Devin Booker drops her.
Trae Young &gt;&gt; Devin Booker
"I've been a fan of the NBA for over 50 years.  I live in the suburbs of DC and became a bullets fan in 1967 when they drafted Wes Unseld, and went from doormats of the league to winning their division and Wes was only the second player ever to win MVP and rookie of the Year awards.  I agree with your choices of non-dominant players on those Mavericks and Heat team and interestingly that Heat team beat a highly favored Mavericks team to win.  I enjoyed seeing that Mavericks team beat the LeBron led Miami Heat teams.  Both my sons 32 and 29 are big NBA fans We watch a lot of the games together, and talking about the Brooklyn Nets and the LA Clippers I was talking to them about those two teams and how they were stacked with veterans.  That 2006 Shaquille O'Neal Dwyane Wade team had Gary Payton a point guard Williams Antoine Walker Alonso morning backing up Shaq.....  That Mavericks team that beat LeBron had all kinds of old veterans Tyson Chandler Jason Kidd Jason Terry Sean Marion they also had Quran Butler but he was hurt when they went to the finals and another wizard a guyI never liked Deshawn Stevenson who came up huge  for them.   I would disagree with you about generational talent Trey Young is as good a guard as I've seen as is Donovan Mitchell ,Devin booker, Jamal Murray he didn't get to play, Jokic, Doncic, ,etc. A  big crop ofgreat players and time will show which of them is truly a generational talent."
Do people honestly think Devin Booker is better than Trae??
People on Reddit hate people with Herro’s personality and appearance for obvious reasons. Same reason Kuzma is hated and Devin Booker for a while.
"[Mike Prada had an interesting thought on this a few days ago](https://twitter.com/MikePradaNBA/status/1408268764886482950?s=20):  &gt;Bev is well-equipped to guard Booker b/c he hits first. Devin wants to speed into the play, stop, hit you, then pivot off you. You disrupt that by getting into him early, and that's what Bev does.    (This is also why Luka fried him. His move cadence is the inverse of Book's)"
“He’s not really a winning player”  The guy hasn’t played a whole two seasons and he’s already given label??? Devin booker couldn’t make the playoffs for years on top of years and years and all it took was an elite pg to elevate their team to contention. We gotta stop giving this dumbass labels to young players just because they don’t come into the league making deep playoff runs
"[Stephen A.] Devin Booker doesnt like Montys music. If i could package Kuzma and maybe even a pick, i make that trade."
"No, Devin Booker"
&gt; Tracy McGrady doesn't hard win a stats argument  He does.  He just had more points/rebounds/steals/blocks with a lower turnover rate at pretty much any point to start their careers. This is while playing in a much slower paced league.  When you factor in pace this looks far worse for booker.  Player per 100 pos age 21-24 | Pts | Reb | Ast | Stl | Blk | TO | on/off  ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Devin Booker | 35.8 | 5.9 | 7.7 | 1.1 | .3 | 5.0 | +3.3   Tracy McGrady | 37.0 | 9.2 | 6.8 | 2.0 | 1.3 | 3.4 | +11.2    Is it the almost extra 1 assist that puts Booker ahead when he played 2 seasons without a proper point guard on his team?
"Regarding Devin Booker can we just line up one narrative please? At 21 Devin Booker averaged 25/5/5, and had a reputation as a good stats bad team guy.  He got more efficient, and we still wanted to see him do something in the playoffs. He is now, he's entering the top echelon of the league as we speak   Compare the points in their careers you cite, Tracy McGrady doesn't hard win a stats argument over. Book is 26.5/5/5 and McGrady is 28.1/7/5. Go fuck yourself if you're trying to sell me that a point and a half and a couple of rebounds more per game is worth more than the fact that Booker's already won more playoff serieses than McGrady did as a number 1 option. Congrats. He won 2 scoring titles, I will never undersell that 32 per game season from McGrady. He was an animal. Booker has earned this recognition though"
I don’t know. I really think your team is a lot better without Luke Walton. Your roster has a lot of guys who you could argue need to be given a chance in a GOOD coaching situation. And I think de’aron fox can be as good as Devin Booker or Donny mitchell.
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
"Dude your main scorer, devin fucking booker, has never averaged 27 in a season. What makes you 'legit' think that Ayton can do it right now?"
"Devin Booker dislikes anyone not in a Suns uniform.  Also, no secret that it’s easy to get under Booker’s skin so might as well mess with him."
really hope the bulls get a turnaround like the suns. practically he's in the same position as devin booker was.
"If we are the champs, I said I’m getting “Be Legendary” tattooed if Devin Booker wins FMVP"
Devin booker is the goat
"I guess by that logic Messi isn't even top 30 players of all time. Obviously Timo Werner is better, he just won the CL.   Devin Booker is clearly better than LeBron James, look he's in the Conference Finals!"
Devin booker voice *🗿*
"&gt; so devin booker and jaylen brown at 58% ts% are just ever so slightly above average?  Literally yes  &gt; .573 is good for guards, especially considering his 34% usage%  I'm not convinced taking the ball out of Sexton's hands will make him more efficient, given his shot selection"
devin “Poland spring” booker
"Suns have obviously been luckier than other teams but people like to pretend the Suns have been 100% healthy - Chris Paul was injured the whole first round, he got healthy then got COVID despite being vaccinated, Devin Booker has a broken nose, and Cam Payne hurt his ankle in game 3."
"The suns can pretty much rely on one of Chris Paul, Devin Booker or Deandre Ayton to deliver in any given game."
I would love to see a hawks and suns in the finals. Trae young vs Devin Booker 🤯
KD didn’t win more than 23 games until his 3rd year in the league. Devin Booker didn’t win 30 games until his 5th!!!! Year in the league. Giannis averaged 6 and 12 points his first two years and his first playoff series win wasn’t until his 5th year. Zion has played 1 season of games because he was legit too out of shape to play in his first season. You guys need to chill the fuck out.
"The Suns are so much better when Booker is part of the offense instead of trying to BE the offense. I’ve seen too many games of Book trying/ needing to iso his way to victory. There are a bunch of guys on this team that can shoot and get to the rim. You don’t have to do everything anymore, Devin."
Devin Booker doing his best Scott Stirling impression.

[Book](https://arizonasports.com/story/2705743/maskless-devin-booker-suns-game-4-win-over-clippers-in-wcf/).  &gt; Booker was clearly not his usual self in Game 3 of the series, his first contest wearing the mask.

Dame about to be fined for tampering with Devin Booker.  https://twitter.com/rachel__nichols/status/1409009564716986373?s=21
"They fucked up the Devin Booker foul out so it was a wash.  That game was horribly officiated, but it seems to fuck over both teams relatively equally  The team that was gonna lost last night wasn't gonna lose because of the refs, they were gonna lose because they both shot 20% from the field"
"That's the point I was trying to make. Booker is a great player already, it's not like he's a raw young guy with great potential. He's already an All-Star and has been the #1 option on a Finals team. People don't say things like ""Russ didn't shoot well tonight but he's good in other aspects I swear,"" that would just be disrespectful. Booker has already made his case that he's a great player, so it's weird to me that in the playoffs and also now we get these sorts of comments. You just need to say ""He's Devin Booker, next question"""
How would this affect Devin Booker and Aytons free agency? Could those two still sign up max when their contracts expire?
Have you seen Lonzo shoot?? He was literally our number one shooter last year and has shot better than players like Devin Booker 2 years in a row
"Bluntly, Devin Booker played his heart out in the NBA finals, lost, and then got on a plane to Tokyo.  Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday could have partied for a month in Milwaukee. They were on a plane to Tokyo as well.  Kevin Durant is the best basketballer on the planet (and, yeah, Im a bucks fan. Father time is undefeated, and the future belongs to Giannis. But right now ? Its KD). After a rough ECF loss where he left his heart on the court, he's there too.  So. They are all American athletes.  And as an Australian, I'm proud they are there. We will need to go through them for the gold medal, and there is no better way than to face the best."
"Because only one person can shoot the ball at a time, and the international teams have clear better players. If Devin Booker was playing with a bunch of G-leaguers in the Olympics he would score a massive number of points (but probably lose) because they'd run the entire offense through him.  A similar thing happens in the NBA when good stars get traded to good teams, or when good players go to lottery teams."
I feel like Devin Booker is going to be the player that grows the most from these olympics.
"I literally watched every minute of the Suns in the playoffs. I had a Suns future to win the West cause I love Devin Booker’s game. He does nothing but score. It’s not some attack on him, he doesn’t have to do anything on the Suns. They have a defensive anchor, a leader who is also the floor general, great bench guys. Booker is there to score."
"Because Paul isn’t really a “negative asset” yet in my opinion. Asset valuations are pretty fluid in the NBA. We’ve literally heard that about Chris Paul himself before, and he was eventually a positive asset again on the same contract by the time Phoenix traded for him. Phoenix wants to remain competitive. If you don’t see a point in that when they realistically won’t win a title, then fine, but Devin Booker probably does. You’re the one claiming he’s furious about it. Burden of proof there lies with you, and I don’t think you have anything to base that on except for an assumption that Devin Booker shares all of your opinions.   Fair point that Lonzo was just one suggestion, but it goes to show that it’s easier said than done to just get somebody else instead. I’m curious, you seem to be (or at least think you are) very informed on the subject; did Phoenix have legit cap space to bid on outside free agents instead of re-signing (not resigning) CP3? I also don’t think many good options were out there regardless. Dinwiddie? They’d go nowhere with him, he’s not that special. Lowry? He probably wouldn’t want to go to PHX over Miami, and even if he did, then they’re just slightly downgrading older PGs to pay big money.  Lonzo? Solid option, but wanted to be on the Bulls as we discussed.  I would personally say that I’m very confident Booker would be far more upset with Phoenix if they let Paul walk for a mediocre replacement or none at all than he is with them for giving CP3 another bag."
Devin Booker is a legit ballhog and KD can't be stopped

Devin Booker has been incredible defensively this half. No joke.

"Devin Booker, the Beige Mamba!"
The good Devin Booker is back ?
"**The Suns.**  **They will be back with last years team but:**  CP3 on a pay cut from 45mil to 30mil. Only 2 years of his 4 year deal are guaranteed.  Cam Payne is back on 6 mil a year for 3 years.  JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.  They are noticeably improved from last season and still have plenty of money to spend.  **The Suns have to following line-up AND 15 mil to spend (plus a 4.5mil injury exception):**  Chris Paul, Cameron Payne, Ty-Shon Alexander      Devin Booker, Landry Shamet      Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson      Jae Crowder, Jalen Smith,      Deandre Ayton, JaVale McGee"
"2nd Quarter Observations:  - People have been hating on Lillard, but he's had a good number of nifty passes in penetration and the pick and roll; the problem is that the recipients (Green, Booker, and Levine) have struggled to convert open looks  - When the US attacks the basket, it's been pretty successful, except when your name is Devin Booker  - Rebounding is the Achilles Heel of this team, and somehow they do better at it without Adebayo on the floor, probably because they get way more defensive strips that way  - Spain's ludicrous shot-making went away after quarter 1, and they really struggled to score in the 2nd except on the offensive glass.   - players who have been invisible: Adebayo, Tatum, Middleton (except for a nice out-of-bounds play and solid defense)"

I'd imagine Devin Booker &amp; Javale spending a bunch of time in Toyko had more to do with it but I'm sure this helped too
Kuzma is two years older than Devin Booker he hasn't been a young star in a while
Phoenix Suns mortgage the best of Devin Booker on last seasons cp3.. Not the declining one that will be 40 by the end contract.  This will ensure they will not be a consistent threat for the championship without severely injured opponents. This last run of understrength teams will not happen again with the seasons back on regular scheduling.
Still waiting for Devin Booker to be in a State Farm commercial
Devin Booker goes right more often than not. Any competent defender that studies tape could make that play   It was a good play don't get me wrong but Jrue has had better defensive plays that have gotten less praise from JVG and Mark
Devin Booker looks like an android with those eyes
Every time Devin Booker makes a mistake he complains to refs like a baby
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."
I'll never understand the Devin Booker hate
"This series has really exposed how unlikeable Devin Booker is - constantly flopping, whining, and foul baiting, just fucking play ball"
Devin Booker is a certifiable dumbass for not just taking that clean at half court. Seriously.     Was he going for the foul on the half for buzzer beater that had never been called in league history? Jesus Christ.    I'm rooting for Milwaukee but dumb shit like that annoys me
"I’m a new fan, only started following sports really recently. Why do I hate Devin Booker with a burning passion?"
The wonderful magical unexplainable disappearance of a Devin Booker
Has devin booker even touched the ball?
same with devin booker when he bitches to the ref
I've been watching about 7 minutes of game time now and I got one question: where the fuck is Devin Booker?
You have Devin Booker and CP3 and Cameron Payne has to bail you out. Unbelievable
Chris Paul and Devin Booker are shook; they're deferring to Ayton
"Cameron Payne bailing out CP3 and devin booker, cmon now dawg"
Devin Booker store brand Kobe Bryant
"this game is on a knife's edge for Phoenix... the crowd is so HYPED, a little 8-0 run by the Bucks might blow this thing wide open... Devin Booker taking 33 shots to get a 40-piece ain't cutting it tonight"
You missed the segment on Chris Paul and Devin Booker?
Devin Booker looks all business. Watch out Bucks
nothing i love more than what watching devin booker lose
How did Devin Booker not commit sue of side after getting the ball stolen from him
Damn Devin Booker is sweaty as fuck already lol
"Yeah, but the stats show that the team is better with Devin Booker on the court.  Personal stats notwithstanding."
Devin 'El Gato' Booker cuz he has nine lives
"Sure, but a big part of that is because the Lakers only had 6 weeks off following their championship win and the start of training camps, and AD was recovering from [an injury he got in Game 5 of the Finals](https://youtu.be/M--IRVucDW8) which in retrospect looks suspiciously like it ties in to the injury issues he had this year. AD needed time to recover and then time to get ready for the season, but the scheduling didn't allow it. You'll find out all about that next season with the short break you guys are gonna get after the Finals ends tonight.   Last season the Suns had the benefit of being so bad that they missed the playoffs entirely and got two nice long breaks and were able to come into the season refreshed and ready, and it showed in their health and availability this year. We'll see how you guys do with it next year when your guys are also going on short rest. I'm particularly going to keep an eye on CP3 with his durability issues (isn't he supposedly hurt right now? Could impact his off-season), Jae Crowder (back to back extremely short off-seasons), and Devin Booker, who's going from tonight's game straight to Tokyo to play for the next month. And of course next year you guys will be without Saric and probably Cameron Payne once he gets a bigger offer in free agency. Best of luck with that, no excuses, ok?"
He looks slow and unathletic. Also staying in college longer is viewed as not being good enough to make the leap at the next level. He’s huge and put up numbers on sheer height advantage but I think the scouts are looking for who’s games can translate the best to the NBA. Not just stats. Devin Booker/Jamal Murray/Tatum/Embiid didn’t put up high scoring numbers in college. You could see their ability #Eyetest matters. Not just stats.
"Or the case of Michael Beasley/Bagley/Zion/Trae with ludicrous college stats and top 5 pick status. A lot of these guys come from stacked teams where the leading scorer may only put up 14 a night.   Hell, Devin Booker didn’t even start at Kentucky."
"Absolutely. That's a lot of talented shooting to space the floor around a generational talent of a center in Embiid. If Lebron was able to drag his early Cavs teams through the playoffs, I believe a healthy Embiid could be competitive with that roster in the playoffs.  Tobias is like Melo with better defense, Seth is low-sodium Steph Curry, and CJ is a Devin Booker / DeMar DeRozan type of scorer. That team, anchored by a talented defensive center with a solid post game like Embiid, could beat a lot of playoff teams in a 7 game series.  Ideally they would also get a veteran point guard like Rondo to run their offense and rack up double-digit assists every game with limited scoring, although Rondo - Curry - CJ could be rough defensively and Seth might have to shift to 6th man."
IDK we should ask Devin Booker
"""You're invalidating my Devin Booker fandom!"""
"CP3’s turnovers are a problem, not *the* problem. The main problem is they bench Devin Booker when we’re up, and don’t put him back into a play until we’re down fighting for our lives. They are playing hard, keeping the games close, they need to play smarter.   Book needs to stop getting himself into foul trouble a well."
"Yup, CP3 has been on my list of most hated guys since like 2013, and I've hated Devin Booker since he was at Kentucky."
"Here is an attempt at putting the article here. There are videos with surrounding text so I cut those and the surrounding text. Sorry if some of it doesn't make sense.  One trend that has perhaps been underdiscussed in these always-evolving NBA Finals: The Milwaukee Bucks are one win from the title in large part because their offense has been really, really good.  The Bucks in the Finals have poured in 117.7 points per 100 possessions, a mark that would have edged the Brooklyn Nets for No. 1 in the regular season. The ugliness of some of Milwaukee's meandering half-court possessions obscures how lethal this team can be when it gets rolling.  The easiest path to that is to not play in the half court at all, and a big theme in this series has been Milwaukee's ability to get out in transition. The Bucks aren't running quite as often as they did in the regular season -- when they played in transition more than any team, per Cleaning The Glass -- but they are still doing so at an above-average rate, and that's a win considering the Phoenix Suns were among the very best at keeping teams out of transition.  And the Bucks are scoring just about every time they hit the open floor: 152.9 points per 100 transition chances, according to Cleaning The Glass. The No. 1 team in the regular season by that measure finished at 133.8. Yowza. This is one of the subtler ways Phoenix's lack of size hurts. Deandre Ayton is the only guy in the Suns' rotation even resembling a big man, and he plays near the rim on offense -- meaning he is rarely back early as a deterrent. No other Sun can make Giannis Antetokounmpo at full throttle pause to think for one second.  The Suns have been a little lax with their floor balance and ball control, but the Bucks are opportunistic; they hunt transition chances with constant urgency.  Behind some hot shooting and smart adjustments from Mike Budenholzer in Game 5, Milwaukee's half-court offense -- its weak spot in past playoffs -- is up to about league-average production for the series, per Cleaning The Glass. The Bucks doing that against one of the league's nastiest half-court defenses is almost cause for a parade.  Milwaukee brutalizing Phoenix on the offensive glass has boosted that half-court scoring figure by turning some initially listless possessions into points. Milwaukee has needed all this offense, because the Suns have scored 115.5 points per 100 possessions -- a hair below their sixth-ranked figure in the regular season. Their effective field goal percentage for the series would have ranked No. 2 behind the Nets; it bumped even higher over Games 3, 4, and 5 -- all Phoenix losses. Phoenix is shooting the bejesus out of it.  The Suns have had to, because, as I noted before Game 5, the Bucks have methodically turned this series into a math problem the Suns can't win. The possession battle is a rout for the Bucks. They are getting more offensive boards and free throws. And their defense is scrunching the Suns' offense toward the midrange to a dangerous extreme. Phoenix is getting to the rim at a league-worst rate, and it has attempted just 30 corner 3s -- six per game, down from its regular-season average of 10. Seventeen of those 30 came in Game 2. In the four other games, the Bucks have basically erased the corners from the court.  It's great and not super shocking that Phoenix is shooting so well; the Suns consciously built around two elite shot-makers in Devin Booker and Chris Paul. It's not great that the Suns have to shoot well -- and almost preposterously well -- to have any chance to win. The Bucks have a margin for so-so shooting; the Suns don't.   Starting in Game 3, the Bucks have found the right mix of defenses to make the Suns uncomfortable. When Brook Lopez is on the floor, the Bucks play a slightly more aggressive version of their base pick-and-roll defense: Lopez ventures out to deter an easy jumper, but not so high as to approximate any sort of trap. He has mostly been able to stay in front of Booker and Paul, and then pivot back to Ayton in time to meet Ayton outside the block-charge circle -- forcing tough hooks and floaters.  The Suns might be able to find traction getting even more creative with where Ayton sets his picks -- sometimes close to midcourt; sometimes at the foul line. (Ayton is also smart about flipping the direction of his pick at the last second.) Booker might benefit from more instant head-down driving, and less pulling back to map the floor. Regardless: Lopez has hung in since the Bucks ditched Game 1's switch-heavy gambit.  When Lopez is off the floor, the Bucks switch everything. They don't seem all that concerned with handing Booker or Paul the Pat Connaughton matchup both are seeking. An adjustment in how Milwaukee's other four defenders react when the Suns get Connaughton on an island is one reason the Bucks have flipped the momentum in these Finals.  One Milwaukee tweak was to stop switching with Lopez. Connaughton at least has a shot of sticking close enough to Paul and Booker as to not require emergency help -- or at least not inspire the fear in his teammates that such help might be required.  It's easy to say Phoenix should spice things up instead of getting bogged down in isolation basketball: keep moving, set more ball screens, run split actions off the ball (when two teammates screen for each other and veer off in random directions), and continue with its sets as if facing a normal defense and not a switch-everything vise grip. The Suns should do all those things!  But elite switching defenses have a way of squeezing that verve out of you -- of making all that motion seem pointless and exhausting.  Milwaukee's offense has had euphoric ups and troubling swoons in the Budenholzer era, including in these playoffs, but its defense has been constant. If the Bucks have a mediocre scoring night after a sizzling first five games, that defense might be good enough to carry them across the finish line."
"Explain Devin Booker not fouling out of game 4 of the finals. His foul on Jrue Holiday made it clear that there was nothing he could do to foul our of that game. However, his being in the game didn't aid in his team coming back as they lost the game. He's kept in there for entertainment purposes. He's a big part of the show."
"I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Sure, they should've taken more 3s maybe throughout the game, but they blew their huge lead while Devin sat and Jae and Torrey Craig started bricking 3s leading to easy buckets for the Bucks..    When you build a 16 point lead you don't just start settling for 3s, you have to be more methodical. Booker sitting out for so long killed the Suns' momentum"
"I think, for me, Devin Booker has pretty clearly been the Suns' better/more important player for the whole season, although not by leaps and bounds. They have both been key to the Suns' success.  The ""value"" argument people make for Chris Paul is entirely in intangibles, i.e. he just makes these guys better. It may be true, may not be but it's impossible to actually say without being in the room with those guys so it seems pointless to argue either way."
Mfs act like its impossible to blow a 3-2 lead lol these same types of posts were rolling in for Chris Paul and Devin Booker when they were up 2-0
"Devin ""Kobe Bean Bryant"" Booker"
"/r/nba: Devin Booker poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses!  Suns fans: he did?  /r/nba: No, but are we just going to wait around until he does?"
I hate Devin booker but admit that Giannis play was total BS and just dangerous.
"Yeah, any type of analysis like this is going to be severely limited, for the reasons you stated.  I guess what it comes down to is this: you are leading and have possession with 3:40 left in an NBA Finals game. As a Suns fan, which scenario do you prefer?  A: a 1 point lead and Devin Booker playing with 5 fouls, or  B: a 38% chance of a 2-3 point lead, but no Devin Booker?   The answer probably seems obvious, but my point is that it may not be."
"You can out Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Zion WIlliamson, Paul George, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, ect. on the Timberwolves and they will still almost certainly be a Lottery team.  Basketball is a team sport, I find it outrageous to blame the Star for a teams lack of success."
Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton - Combined 12/34  r/nba - Hur hur Chris Paul not clutch
I have 0 respect for the suns espically with the antics Jae crowder and cp3 pull and with antics Devin booker does I’m happy they lost
I need Devin booker to never make a finals again. He doesn’t deserve to ever win
"&gt; If Devin Booker hits his average two or three three pointers tonight, Suns are looking at a game seven.  Or if Giannis ""Shaq"" Antetokounmpo shows up, rather than Giannis ""Steph"" Antetokounmpo.  Think about that, Giannis hit more 3pt shots than Booker this game and shot *90 fucking percent* from the line for nearly 20 shots.  This was a matter of the Bucks' best player putting up an absolute all-time legend of a performance on the same night Phoenix's best player(s) struggled."
"Yeah, this was the elimination game that Devin Booker decided to go cold in...."

Devin Armani Booker
He did show up to this game though. Devin Booker however...  of all the games to be cold in....
"Sad for Chris Paul, but I’m glad Devin Booker didn’t win a title and we’d have to pretend that he’s better than he is for the rest of his career"
"Devin Booker went back to back 40+ in four and five. Not sure I would say he shut the superstars down defensively.   The problem is that the Suns didn't have a generational talent on their team, and the coaching staff had no ability to motivate their team to play all four quarters of each game like they actually wanted to win the championship."
You can say the same thing for the entire series with Devin booker too.
The man made Devin Booker dissapear
"Every other player on the Suns, before they took a shot, I knew if I could feel good or bad about it; it was from a spot they don't like, they had a certain defender on them, the timing seemed off or their balance didn't look right. Devin Booker denied me any opportunity to feel safe about any look that the Phoenix Suns had. He was amazing this series."
The kid showed up major in prime time. Devin Booker is be a perennial all star from this point on. No more injury replacement all star appearances.

"This is a franchise that went 87-241 from 2015-2019. They were an absolute laughingstock, Devin Booker was brushed aside as a stat padder who couldn't win anything, and they served nachos with pickles on 'em Ernie. They might've fallen short this season, but they have a promising future with a solid core now."
"Huh...? Devin Booker is 24 years old, Ayton is going to improve.   This isn't the closest your guys have to getting a chip lol, they have finals experience now, and the only thing you have to be concerned about is who is going to replace when CP3 leaves"
Idk about if the 07 cavs beat the suns. But yeah this sub acting like Facing the Tim Duncan/Manu/Tony Spurs and the big 3 Celtics vs Devin Booker and Chris Paul is the same thing lmfao
"Devin Booker won the NBA cares award , Monty is a fucking saint whose wife died in an accident, Deandre Ayton is a big lovable goof. I know some of y'all have issues with the Suns but there isn't any reason to think they are ""bad people"", and if you look at this world and think outcomes are about your personal virtue then you are just fucking stupid. This guy is a joke."
Devin Booker stayed on the court and hugged a bunch of Bucks players
From the clip it looks like a pickup game where they double teamed someone. Sure It’s not traditional in that setting but it’s Devin Booker
"*Devin Booker gives another forearm shiver to a defender who doesn't touch him otherwise, gets another shooting foul.*  *Jae Crowder falls down after every shot, gets another foul.*  Cry harder."
"Last years Finals had two of the Heat's best players suffer relatively serious injuries (with one out for the series, and the other playing hobbled after missing some time), and their best player getting a minor injury, all in Game 1.  If Deandre Ayton and Devin Booker got hurt in this series, we'd never hear the end of how ""easy"" it was.  But everyone forgets that about last year because it's the Lakers and LeBron."
"James Harden, Trae Young, Devin Booker, etc are all walking buckets and more offensively talented than Giannis, yet have legions of haters."
"cause you're a Lakers fan who most likely idolizes high volume, ego centric, individual scoring players; which Devin Booker is one of"
