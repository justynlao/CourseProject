Jokic Murray MPJ Monte Morris JaMychal Green
"**Pleasant**: Monte Morris. Dude has gotten better every year and in an early season where most outside of Joker are struggling, Monte has been a constant point and play making boost off of the bench. Oh and JaMychal Green is dope.   **Unpleasant**: Everyone else, really. Will and Gary have taken their time getting back in the groove.. Will is more frustrating to watch because his game revolves around having the ball.. Gary as well though because he should be a critical piece in our offense and just... isn't, but we need his defense.  MPJ went and broke protocols so while it's nice he's back missing him for 20 days was annoying.   Facu had a great game yesterday but otherwise was having a rough transition to NBA ball while being undersized.  I didn't really expect Jamal to seriously ascend to All-Stardom, but injuries are making him less impactful than usual.   I've been annoyed with Millsap since the restart. He just isn't a great fit, but as long as he can hit occasional threes he isn't a huge detriment."
"When Jokic was drafted, they called him a power forward. He plays with guys like JaMychal Green who can play 5. Not to mention, Anthony Davis refuses to be called a center. So I think the person who deserves it most should get 1st team regardless, if we‚Äôre following last year‚Äôs precedent."
"In the Clippers series, the Clippers went really small and took Zubac out, took Montrezl out, and put JaMychal Green at the 5. Malone noticed that Jokic was getting doubled and Murray was getting blitzed frequently, and set up more plays for Harris and Grant.  Defensively, the Nuggets, according to Kawhi Leonard, became more aggressive in their double-teams. Additionally, they adjusted to collapsed the paint paint better on drives. A big part of this was Malone's decision to reign in MPJ, which you may remember was pretty vocal about this at the time. These were some adjustments that were mad that helped them come out of the Clippers series."
Shoutout to Campazzo and JaMychal Green
Don't forget JaMychal Green.
Thank you for Jamychal Green
Jamychal Green said YEET
"Lol nuggets.     JaMychal green is a better shooter, equal defender, and a better rebounder (this one despite playing 15 less minutes per game) than Grant.     Good on Grant for proving he can be a number 1 or 2 option, but acting like the Nuggets would be better off with him instead of Green is a total misread of the situation."
JaMychal Green
for nuggets and laker fans - how are jamychal green and trezz doing?
Jamychal Green has been covering for Jerami's defense and PJ Dozier for Craig's. Defense wasn't a problem in past 10 games until last night. I have a feeling it was fatigue related.
"So many good role players are underrated  JaMychal Green, Bazley, donte, luwau cabarot, hunter"
If only we kept jamychal green
"Not washed, but severely underrated: JaMychal Green."
"&gt; Ibaka has a good playoff history  Sure, back in his prime, but he's not in his prime anymore. If you look at his most recent playoff appearance he was played off the floor against Boston and now he's a year older. Here's why I don't think the Clippers offseason was that great, the way the OP above was saying it was: the Clippers still have the same problem this year that they did last year, in that if Ibaka isn't up to the challenge the way Trez wasn't last year, they have no other option. At least last year the Clippers could theoretically turn to JaMychal Green at center, but he's gone too, replaced with another wing.   Ibaka might be slightly better against Jokic or AD than Trez would have been, but he's primed to still get cooked by both, and if that happens, then what? Last year Boston played Ibaka off the floor with Daniel fucking Theis at center, but you're counting on him to hang with Anthony Davis? Answer me this: if Ibaka can't contain AD, what else can the Clippers do? I don't see Batum, Morris or Kawhi being able to guard him instead.   Batum has been a productive signing for the Clippers, but he's redundant because he's just another wing. The Clippers needed more frontcourt help, and while they did get Ibaka, they lost Green and Trez along the way. They're thinner now at center than they were last year, and you guys are acting like Ibaka is simply the answer. Again, go look at what happened to him last year against Boston and tell me how he's the solution there."
"The Clippers had a good off-season, but definitely not the best, especially among contenders. Batum was a great signing for them, and Kennard is a mild upgrade over Shamet, but the contract they gave Kennard is clearly a big mistake, as was the one they gave Marcus Morris.   And I think it's wrong to say they ""upgraded"" from Trez to Ibaka, as Trez contributed more last year (and this year) than Ibaka currently is. Trez had a horrendous playoffs so Ibaka will probably be better this year in the postseason than Trez was last year, but overall Trez is currently the better player, and simply losing him for nothing was bad for them. I think that assessing Trez's value based solely on his play in the bubble coming off the death of his grandmother is just wrong.  Additionally the Clippers also lost Jamychal Green to free agency, and he was a very productive player for them. Kennard, Batum and Ibaka replacing Shamet, Green and Trez I'd say is collectively an upgrade, but more of a mild one, not an overwhelming one. The Clippers still have big depth problems in their front court and still lack any kind of reliable playmaker. And they seem to be extremely limited in ways to address these flaws this year."
I think you're right (Craig was a pretty tough defender on the whole you can't just find that anywhere. We do have JaMychal Green now tho)
"You have to look beyond the record. Jokic has been utterly dominant, just as much as Embiid has been while also literally running the offense and setting up his teammates - dude leads the league in assists, as a center. He's 4th in the NBA in steals. Leads the league in PER, and is at or near the top in BPM, DRPM, TPA, etc. He's scored or assisted on 42% of the Nuggets made baskets this year, which is the highest percent in the NBA (next closest is Luka at 40%, and PG and Embiid are closer to like 25% each respectively since people are mentioning them). And honestly he's doing this with teammates that mostly have been subpar so far.  What I mean partly - the Nuggets have been incomplete the whole year. Murray hurt his elbow in the 3rd game and hasnt really be right since, missed one game but he's still bothered by it. JaMychal Green missed the first four games, and MPJ missed the last 10, so the Nuggets depth/size at forward has been quite bad mostly. Monte Morris has been steady as always, PJ Dozier is ok, defends well, JaMychal Green has been solid as a backup 4... but Gary Harris is still one of the worst shooters in the NBA, and Will Barton has been wildly up and down (and REALLY cant finish at the rim). Paul Millsap is incapable of finishing in the paint anymore, for the most part. Like, Jokic's teammates have really not been very good, and he still is just dominant (to add a bit more evidence, only 3 Nuggets have a positive net rating when playing without Jokic - Murray, Monte Morris, and PJ Dozier). It's not a stretch to say that Jokic is quite literally the only thing separating the Nuggets from being average right now in record (with the 5th best net rating in the NBA mind you), and being utterly awful, like worst team in the NBA. With him on the floor the Nuggets offensive rating is 120. With him off, it's 97 which is historically bad (and also the largest difference in offensive on-off rating in the NBA by a HUGE margin). If all that doesn't make someone an MVP candidate I dunno what does."
"Last year, I think Jamychal Green for the Clippers; the bench unit offense strictly ran through Lou and Trezz.  I don't think he had as much of an opportunity to shine."
Monte Morris   JaMychal Green
My mans just called Montrezl Harrell a TOP FIVE player.  You just said Kemba wasn‚Äôt even a ‚Äòstar‚Äô yet a man who has to sign a VETERAN MINIMUM just so he can spite his former team IS? And since when did Doc Rivers LEAVE? He was let go cause he couldn‚Äôt stop blowing 3-1 leads. ‚ÄúSeveral Role players left‚Äù? Since when was Jamychal Green several players?  Stick to baseball man.
They need a Jamychal Green.
nuggets fans how is jamychal green looking? i miss him and want the best for him üò≠
Big Facts. Tae is the only consistent guy coming off their bench this season (JaMychal Green too tbh). Dude is so fucking smooth with everything he does
"Honestly, the biggest reason is because we've just not really played together yet. Michael Porter Jr and JaMychal Green haven't even played together, and they're both big components. We started like 1-4 while JaMychal was out, and we climbed to 5-5 when he started playing. Murray got hurt, so he's having his weak games, even though he started the season off really well (exception of his first game). MPJ has been gone for a long time too, and he was cooking.    Just give the Nuggets some time to figure out the roster and actually play together and we'll be climbing up the rankings."
"Prolly but there‚Äôs no guarantee we win it all even if he did spend. It‚Äôs not like we were spending it on stars, people are upset because he didn‚Äôt extend Ariza for 15M or trade for Garrett Temple/JaMychal Green. I‚Äôm sure Harden is tired of carrying teams with role players around him.   On the Nets, he has a higher chance at a finals appearance   Even if Tillman did spend, Harden would still prolly leave   His decision came after we lost to the Lakers, KD and him were hooping together in LA and the rest is history.  There was no possible way for Rockets to get to that level anymore, and he knew it. That‚Äôs why he said ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt good enough and it can‚Äôt be fixed‚Äù"
"Depends who you ask. I think Barton has been the same guy for a couple years. He‚Äôs a ball handler who looks to get his own shot. Works great as a 6th man against bench units but not as a starter. Completely disrupts Murray and jokic‚Äôs chemistry.  We need wing depth. And a back up center. I was really hoping we would make a push for Jae crowder, or even a long shot on Gordon Hayward, who I think would literally be perfect in Denver‚Äôs offense. But alas, we only signed jamychal green."
"Most nuggets fans will tell you it‚Äôs because people are out or it‚Äôs early season or some other bullshit. The truth is since the start of last year, we have lost 5 key rotation players to either trades that resulted in nothing of value for the nuggets or let go in free agency. Grant, plumlee, Craig, Beasley, and hernangomez all out the door with not a lot of value coming in outside of jamychal green."
"It's quite apparent Jokic foul baits pretty often. Not as much as Luka but it ruins the flow of the game a few times.   Defensively, our bench is as shallow as a puddle. JaMychal Green is definitely a much needed addition off his delayed season start, but losing Grant and Craig really screwed our depth."
"it's a bit hard to tell in his case because the roster and lineups don't make a lot of sense   he's often guarding 4s in a 4 guard lineup (beside some combination of murray, harris, barton, campazzo) with like hartenstein or jamychal green at the 5  i'd say he's an above average defender, and he's young and seems to have the tools to be a playable basketball player"
"Tough to say due to small sample size, but I‚Äôm gonna go with Reggie Perry is currently a poor mans JaMychal Green. Perry is a 6‚Äô8/6‚Äô9 250lbs 4/5 that has the ability to shoot"
We won't need to. Our backup plan is AD at center. Not JaMychal Green.
"I think I share all the same doubts with you but there‚Äôs always the chance. Blazers continue to be cursed with Nurkic breaking his wrist and they don‚Äôt have a backup guard but maybe Collins and Simons step up like people have been expecting.   Losing Grant hurts for Denver but I think once Jamychal Green gets integrated he can replicate some of that defense and add some more BBIQ at the cost of the energy Grant brought. Murray also needs to become consistent for anything to happen there.   With the Warriors, I just think that Steph-Draymond guarantees at least a playoff berth, and if Oubre/Wiggins/Wiseman can at least be ok collectively instead of starting off the year shooting 5% from three (lol) that elevates a little.   Gobert‚Äôs been fine - he does what he does and can guard on the perimeter capably. Their bigger problem seems to be Mitchell‚Äôs inconsistency (like Murray) and the fact that they can‚Äôt seem to get the best out of the combination of Mitchell/Conley/Bogdanovich at once.   All this to say, I think I would also put Mavs in tier 2 and top 4 but think it‚Äôs kind of shaky ground still."
"Give some credit to our big men. Jokic is unguardable, Milsap is as smart and experienced as they come, and JaMychal Green is hitting 50% of his 3 point shots."
Consider me a massive JaMychal Green fan.
JaMychal Green commits an offensive foul after complaining about a defensive foul
Jamychal Green chose violence
"Vanderbilt is probably the best we have and odds are he might crack the starting lineup soon.   It was a known issue this roster is missing a 4. We tried to get Millsap, JaMychal Green, Derrick Jones Jr, and Jae Crowder in free agency. Some we couldn't afford but others just chose other teams. We've also been rumored to be probing trades for PJ Tucker, Larry Nance Jr, and Aaron Gordon.  Our GM has been trying but not much has come our way."
"We got the better jg   Yeah that's right, Jamychal Green    ~~jerami please come back i still love you~~"
I can‚Äôt stand Frazier. He just called Jamychal Green effervescent and vivacious. He tries too hard
JaMychal Green seems decent at it as well but he's undersized
Plumlee‚Äôs a better defender than Jokic and Malone could bring him in late for that reason. Plumlee‚Äôs defense is definitely missed. I do think JaMychal Green can take that role as the season goes on though.
"He's still getting paid 20m  Nuggets would look something like this - Murray (30m) + Jokic (30m) + Gary Harris  (20m) + Grant (20m) + Barton (15m) + Monte Morris (10m)   You don't have any money to sign JaMychal Green and I'm no salary cap expert I think you have to let Paul Millsap go if you want to talk about the future with MPJ and potentially the possibility of an extension the next year, Gary Harris by then would become a FA though, so you can choose to resign or let him leave in FA because you probably can't pay him as much as he would like.  From in the 2020 season advanced stats show the Nuggets offense and defense was better when he was off the court, but idk - check in 2 months time to see if he's still ballin."
"The Clippers hardly gutted their team. Their roster last year was pretty stacked... Beverly, Lou, Trez, Harckless, Jamychal Green, Zubac, and eventually Morris and Reggie J. They didn‚Äôt lack talent. Kyrie and KD seem to have a clearly better relationship than KD and PG."
"But now you have Ibaka and Batum, and have gotten rid of Trezz. The only major defensive loss player-wise you guys have this year vs last year is JaMychal Green, right?"
"Called PJ Dozier Jamychal Green, Monty Morris instead of Monte, Will Borson?, said our bench is missing MPJ(who is our starter) due to injury(out for covid protocol, not injured), and said Bill Walton is the best passing big of all time because he's a winner. Just a rough game to listen to."
They about to pull out the JaMychal Green blame card
^and ^Jamychal ^Green
Jeff Green   Draymond Green   Javonte Green   Danny Green   JaMychal Green   Josh Green
JaMychal Green is living the dream man!
&gt;It's literally Jokic and bunch of scrubs so far this year.  I mean you have MPJ and Murray. Jamychal Green is also shooting 62/62/62 splits.
"this Nuggets team is bad.  Jokic is the only player doing incredible things.  Murray, Harris, Dozier, Millsap, Barton are not that good.  Jamychal Green needs more minutes at times.   The west is not fucking around. the Nuggets are"
"Jamychal Green right?  Only know that because I really wanted him on the Mavs, he‚Äôs a quality bench guy now."
"This Nuggets team needs a ton of help.  Harris / Dozier / Millsap are not up to par right now.  Jamychal Green looks like a good contribution.  Jokic is carrying this team, and the rest of this team needs to step up. The west is not f*cking around this season, and the Nuggets are.  edit/ I said Jeff instead of Jamychal out of anger."
If you told me that Jamychal Green and Freddie Gibbs were brothers I would believe you
"I was thinking I just saw Jeff Green in the last game how is he here on the Nuggets, turns out it's JaMychal Green"
 It‚Äôs JaMychal Green and he is 30.
"Draymond Green, Danny Green, JaMychal Green, A.C. Green, Rachel Greene. Lakers in 4"
"I know it's pedantic but we're 2-4, haha.  And actually have a healthy Jamychal Green to fill out our bench now.  Doesn't sound like much but when he was hurt we had literally zero replacement for Jerami Grant's production and role and it was noticeable."
JaMychal Green played a lot of center with us. Only thing new is Dozier at PF.
A player who I trust to hit open threes? I think I love Jamychal Green
"JaMychal Green(who was out until the suns game), PJ Dozier, Will Barton, and Hartenstein those four are not getting it done right now maybe they‚Äôll turn it around but they are not near the level of production that Grant, Plumlee, and Craig were providing for the team especially defensively"
"I didn't expect 1-4 from the Nugs, but I don't think it's surprising at all. Training camp and pre-season were so short, you almost have to expect some teams to not have the kinks in their system worked out. This is especially true for teams like Denver that have had so much change. Plumlee and Grant gone, MPJ taking on a major rotation role, Barton coming back, Jamychal Green joining the squad, etc. It's a lot, but they'll figure it out."
"Right now? Basketball.   Overall and looking ahead a bit: depth. If Barton and Harris continue to play the way they currently are then the Nuggets really only have 3 legit starting calibre players, maybe 4 if you throw in Millsap. The bench would be solid if Barton picks thing up with Monte Morris, Jamychal Green but the team going forward is perpetually a couple of shooting slumps or injuries away from being terrible like they are right now."
Nuggets gonna need to trade for Nerlens Noel   Neither Jamychal green or millsap are fit to play defense next to Jokic or even the back up minutes at 5
"You can say that and it's fair but last year the Nuggets had some similar issues. Paul Millsap and MPJ were all but unplayable defensively in that series - JaMychal Green is much more mobile than Millsap and should be able to stay out there when Bojan is out there. MPJ's defense is night day different this year, he's not good there yet but he's much, much better defensively and improving by the game while also actually being integrated into the offense as a weapon (if he's fully integrated, there's no one on the Jazz that can guard him either). By the same token with the Conley thing, Gary Harris didnt come back in the playoffs until game 6. He missed the first 5 and his defensive presence was felt quite strongly by Mitchell and Conley both in games 6 and 7. No guarantee he plays if they match up a gain, but I think that's part of why Denver's held him out so long, they want to make sure Gary is healthy for the playoffs. Jamal Murray is also vastly improved on the defensive end too. PJ Dozier is better at dealing with guards than Jerami Grant was since... y'know, that's his actual position. Will Barton didnt play last year in the playoffs at all. He gets a lot of ire from Nuggets fans (including myself at times), but he's a good 2-way player when healthy and locked in. He defends decently/with good effort and length (and there's not really anyone on the Jazz save Bojan who can punish his slight build), and he can get to the rim and shoot. Both are different teams, and the Nuggets are a different team arguably moreso than the Jazz, they've just had some quite bad luck with injuries and a couple covid related absences.   I still maintain that despite all the differences in both teams, it will come down to if the Jazz can stop Murray and Jokic, and... I just dont think they can. We have a pretty clear trend now in the last what, 12 games they've played including the playoffs, Jokic dominates Gobert at this point, and Murray can get to whatever spot he wants (in this way too, Murray is harder to scheme against than Mitchell - both great players no doubt, and Mitchell is especially good if you let him get to the rim, but he's not quite as good of an outside or midrange shooter - and Murray's best skill is his ability to make difficult shots along with that 3 level ability... you can take 1 or even 2 areas away but it's extremely difficult to take away everything. Even Kawhi/PG/Pat Bev couldnt do it)"
"When Murray was hurt and MPJ was out for COVID, Jokic was like the only player on the team. Was a rough start. And even right now, Paul Millsap, JaMychal Green, Facu Compazzo, and Gary Harris are all out. 2 of those guys are starters, the other 2 are important rotation pieces."
"No. The picks used helped to swallow the remaining salary of the Brendan Knight and Marquese Chriss contracts, as well as ship out Nick Stauskas in the deal that brought Shumpert's expiring contract to the team.  The Rockets could have used the same picks package (technically less) to get JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple from the Grizzlies, but were averse to the $3M in tax that deal would have incurred."
2 on Memphis looks like JaMychal Green
"Thanks Jamychal Green, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory."
"Well then enlighten me, Barton isn't a wing and actually isn't a good defender anymore after his injuries, Millsap also isn't a wing and is just bad now with his age, Porter sucks at defense.  If you think JaMychal Green is a ""top wing defender"" I don't really know what to tell you."
Lillard/Danny green/middleton/Covington/bam  Rivers/smart/osman/jamychal/muscala
Jamychal Green led the league in 3P% in 2018-9. He‚Äôs a career 37.4% shooter. That‚Äôs pretty elite
"That wasnt Jokic's fault, that was JaMychal Green's man. JMG was fronting Len and went for an impossible steal and Len was way too far out for Jokic to have any chance to recover without fouling him on the dunk attempt. One of a handful of just supremely dumb plays Green made in this game, along with his attempted save on the fucking AIR BALL (with NOT A SINGLE WIZARD NEARBY) that turned into a Bradley Beal corner 3. Just sheer idiocy."
"Murray is inconsistent maybe due to injuries,   Grant is gone,   Millsap is older and injured,   Plumlee gone and his replacement is a G league caliber(hartenstein),   Garry Harris injured,   pj dozier injured,   Jamychal Green playing very badly for two weeks and occasionally injured,   Bol Bol is useless,   Monte Morris injured,   Barton unavailable due to personal reasons,   MPJ Shooting 20% so mostly benched also due to very bad plays not just bad shooting  basically 3 people can play right now except rookies. Campazzo, Joker and Murray available only"
Because he jumped right into JaMychal Green? Watch the replay under the basket. He wasn‚Äôt even trying to make the shot he just jumped into the nearest defender.
That's a vertical jump by Jamychal Green...
"Jamychal Green was pitifully bad down the stretch; he literally lost the game and blew the comeback. I mean, five points on two possessions on fouls. wow"
JaMychal Green . . . wtf.  Two stupid fouls were the only reason the Wiz couldn't give away this meaningless win.
Ouch Jamychal Green with the foul on Bertans then this
JaMychal Green sold
"Jamychal Green had money on the Wiz, I have no other explanation for it"
JaMychal Green gave the Wizards 5 free points in 30 seconds
Jamychal Green is a great guy to look at for the award. He was an underrated part of the Clippers bench last year
"Like say if the Nuggets go on a winning streak I like to think that it would be possible for a guy like Jamychal Green to get more votes then Lou Williams who has been bad all year but who is the ""6th man archetype"".  Clarkson is VERY VERY good at that, like Lou was 2 years ago when he won it so I have no problem with those guys winning it, but when it's debatable I like the voters to reward who the actual best player is and not just look at ""points per game"""
"Looking back now it looked like an all time fleece tbh. Blake for Tobi and Bobi (traded to 76ers to grind up picks for PG13), Avery Bradley (then traded for JaMychal Green who was great) and 2018 1st (that they traded up for SGA (included in PG13 trade). Wow"
"Idk man that Nuggets bench is pretty good, they got:  Monte Morris  Facundo Campazzo  PJ Dozier  JaMychal Green  Paul Millsap  &amp;#x200B;  Idk if it's better defensively but efficiency wise they are (even tho they don't shoot at the volume the Knicks bench does), not to mention 11-15 they are by far the best in the NBA imo. I mean RJ Hampton, Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, are all getting minutes on most teams imo."
"I‚Äôm a bad homer, but Nuggets are so deep, Idk who will play when we are fully healthy:  Monte Morris, Facu Campazzo, RJ Hampton, PJ Dozier all legit role-players  and the only non-guard bench rotation player: JaMychal Green"
I thought one of the biggest blunderers by Doc Rivers last year was not playing Jamychal Green as much as he should
"Underrated:  * Royce O‚ÄôNeal * Derrick Favors * Jamychal Green * Cam Payne * Justin Holiday * Thad Young * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate   Overrated:  * Marc Gasol * Lou Williams (maybe less so now) * Carmelo Anthony * Robert Covington * JJ Redick  * Matisse Thybulle * Donte DiVincenzo  * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate that just signed a big contract  It‚Äôs like the other guy says, good or large teams that have a lot of fans and a lot of attention on them will generally have their role players overrated, bad teams and small market teams will generally have their role players go under the radar."
"i‚Äôm curious about this actually. was losing jerami grant that big of a hit? also, if you have the time, could you tell me how jamychal green is looking? i miss him but saw a handful of your games where he was looking good but haven‚Äôt seen enough to know really. i hope he‚Äôs getting more minutes than doc was giving him and i hope he‚Äôs happy in denver!"
"It wasn‚Äôt just the contract (and he signed so fast we didn‚Äôt really have a chance)- he wanted to play for a a Black coach and a Black front office, in a majority Black city: https://www.google.com/amp/s/theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/%3Famp.  Not kidding, was an actual reason which I respect. Either way he wasn‚Äôt THAT important for us in the regular season last year though ofc it does hurt, but JaMychal Green has been super good in a similar role. We will probably make a trade, also Murray, Barton etc have been awful, Gary has been hurt and the bench is just figuring it out. But we have a top 5 net rating playing the 3rd hardest schedule in the league so far so I expect the record to improve significantly as we start playing more below .500 teams."
"Also all the injuries... Harris has been out recently, MPJ was out for a while, Jamychal Green was out at the beginning, and Murray is playing hurt."
It‚Äôs Jokic and JaMychal Green. Those dudes are gonna be friends for life
"Ah the classic comment to tell how someone clearly hasn‚Äôt watched him this year.   Idk how anyone surrounded by an injured Murray, an undersized defensively terrible guard in Morris, a 36 year old Millsap, a dumbass MPJ, Barton who‚Äôs been getting roasted by wings, and 5‚Äô11 29 year old rookie would play good defense. Jamychal green has been his only defensive help on this losing streak.   Embiid has a top 3 guard/wing defender in the league in Simmons, Dwight Howard, a much improved Tobias, Thybulle among others to help him.    He‚Äôs been playing better defense and it‚Äôs clear when you watch him, and it‚Äôs also clear his defense is not the issue. Stats back this up."
"Man, if people thought Jokic roasted the Clippers last year when they had Zubac, Trez and JaMychal Green to put on him, imagine what he'd do to them this year if all they had was Ibaka to play center. It should be pointed out that Ibaka is only averaging 24 mpg this year. If they trade Zubac, it would be like last year's Rockets all over again üòÇ"
"I agree. I feel like Jamychal Green is one of those guys, they just need more ppl who can reliably shoot off of Jokic's dimes."
"Nuggets-Facu, PJ Dozier, AG, JaMychal Green, JaVale McGee"
I would compare Gary Clark to a smaller and worse version of Jamychal Green
"At what point do the equal punishments just lead you tossing in a bench guy to start a fight with a star? Let's imagine it is the playoffs, Nuggets vs Lakers. At what point do you just tell JaMychal Green to go out there and start a shoving match with AD. Refs are just gonna toss you both and that will hurt the other team more."
Hey remember when the clippers had jamychal green
"I thought that was mostly about our rotations  There was a couple minute stretch where we had JaMychal Green on him, no center, and three guards, and he was just slicing it up.  We pretty much matched Kawhi's minutes with Gordon and usually MPJ was there too so he had to deal with a ton of length whenever he was out there and I think his legs went down the stretch"
PJ Dozier and (imo) JaVale McGee  JaMychal Green and Facundo Campazzo are in that teir too.
Paul Millsap and JaMychal Green
Gary Harris missed 25 games.   MPJ missed 10.  Millsap missed 10.   Jamychal Green missed 13 games.  Monte Morris missed 11 games.  Dozier missed 15.  All of these guys are in their rotation and play 20+ minutes.
"Paul Millsap yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Michael Porter JR gave a look of pleasant surprise. JaMychal Green belted, ‚ÄúWe got an [expeltive] squad now.‚Äù And before Nikola Jokic could hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Allen Iverson hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
Yep.  2019 Rockets and Warriors series was extremely close. JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple would‚Äôve helped so much.  And dang I remember Melton was on the Rockets but they bundled him with Anderson
Tbh would any team go into the luxury tax for Ariza? Who wanted $15M  He should‚Äôve gone into the tax for Garett Temple and JaMychal Green
"This is a nasty team. Bench is also fine tho, jamychal green will barton monte morris facundo campazzo javale mcgee. Definitely winning the west."

"This is JaMychal Green, mah boy."
1. Jokic 2. Murray 3. MPJ 4. Gordon? 5. Barton 6. Monte Morris 7. PJ Dozier 8. Jamychal Green 9. Facuuu  10. Javale McGee? Idk
Paul Millsap is not a solid role player this year. Jamychal Green has missed a lot of games. And Will Barton is pretty much putting up the same stats as Carmelo Anthony but we're forced to start him.
"Don‚Äôt forget about Paul Millsap, Will Barton, JaMychal Green, I mean they have quite a few really solid role players. There‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre in contention for the conference championship and potentially a title. Portland is Damian‚Äôs Band of Misfit Toys and Talent. He sent my entire franchise to the shadow realm, and I still want this man to get MVP. I really don‚Äôt understand how people can possibly argue the value Dame has to Portland. He is one of a VERY select few players whose max contracts are actually undervaluing them as assets."
"Jokic is just not a good defender. Statistically, he the 2nd worst paint defender (behind jamychal green, who is also on our team.) And no, getting steals does not mean he's a good defender. His offense more than makes up for his deficiency on the defensive end, but he's simply not good."
"&gt;Love didn‚Äôt really appreciate being left with a bunch of kids  He could've been a professional and taken on a mentor role instead of bitching ever since the moment he got paid.  &gt; He should‚Äôve been traded to a competing team long ago.   Nobody wants him with that contract.  &gt; Sucks to be a decent player who could compete on a rebuild tanking team.   Decent is generous, I'd rather have JaMychal Green today than Kevin Love. It's not 2009 anymore."
Since when is JaMychal Green a center?
"Damn that's really bad but at least he isn't the worst, that JaMychal Green guy must suck wouldn't want him on my team that's for sure"
Lol you guys really have no idea how inconsistent Denvers line ups have been do you? Mpj missed 3 weeks in Jan. Gary Harris (our best defender..) has missed over half he season.  Jamychal green missed 15 games and Paul Millsap came back yesterday after 3 weeks off.  Outside of Portland I can't think of any team that's getting screwed worse from Injuries/covid.  Also calling Denver the 5th seed is funny. Until Lakers won their game yesterday they were the 4th seed. Let's not act like they're miles ahead. It's a close race
"&gt;If Jokic is able to get a top 3 seed, then there's an argument for him.   Oh so it's ""Most Valuable Player on a Top 3 seed"" award?   Jokic has been doing all of this with a rotating cast of heavy injuries.  They didn't have Milsap [starting 4] or JaMychal Green [backup 4] vs the Bucks [and have been without Gary Harris for a long time] and still whooped them.   Also, the thing so many people miss, is that without a superstar sidekick [or like I said, even an All-Star sidekick], the 3rd/4th/5th/6th best players on the team become even more important when the 2nd isn't a superstar. MPJ, Harris, Milsap, Green, and Dozier have all missed significant time. Murray was visibly playing hurt most of the beginning of the year too [and his numbers show it - - he's been much better of late]."
"Only because Tilman refused to pay tax to replace Ariza and M'bah a Moute with a rotation-quality forward.  If they make the deal for JaMychal Green or another good forward, that team would have certainly been on a similar level."
"Hasn't MPJ shown a lot more promising results at the 4 versus the 3?  I know MPJ playing the 4 was a result of Paul Millsap and JaMychal Green being injured but Millsap's washed anyways. No reason that MPJ couldn't be the starting 4 for the rest of the season next to Barton.  I kind of figured that Gary Harris would be the most expendable since he continues to fall off a cliff offensively but I know his defense is valuable. He's way overpaid though and wouldn't have any trade value.   Either way, losing Grant sucked. Barton's too undersized for the 3."
WHY DOES JAMYCHAL GREEN LOOK EXACTLY LIKE JEFF GREEN FROM THIS ANGLE
Imo the most obvious missed call was JaMychal Green shoving Griffin right before he failed to secure the offensive rebound. That no one here is mentioning it tells me a lot about where the ref complaints are coming from.   Also think these complaints are a lot worse when a homer tv analyst decides to pretend to be a reffing expert.
"Tough game overall, but Jamychal Green threw this."
"Tough game, but damn Jamychal Green threw that game."
Lmao Jamychal Green what the fuck?
Jamychal Green worst game of his life lol
Jamychal Green &gt; KD???
Incredible pass by Jokic to JaMychal Green...
I really think JaMychal Green is an underrated player
I mean Doc gonna keep throwing the same shit; Jamychal Green would've been better on Jokic than Harrell
"How can everyone on the Nuggets be so bad at defense when the Nuggets are so good at defense?   Jokic bad. MPJ bad. Campazzo annoying but bad. Barton (was) bad. Murray (was) bad. Morris (was) bad.   AG I guess? Makes sense. He's so good he carried their defense before he even got to the team. Lol. It's getting pretty tired that just because they don't have a flashy defensive scheme Nuggets players can't play D.   Y'all know MPJ is doing better than Jamychal Green and Paul Millsap on defense, right? Hes honestly been comparable to AG. Idk what exactly that says about either of them, but aside from MPJ having a little more of his strengths in help defense and AG having a little more of his 1 on 1.... They're very comparable. Above average switchable forwards with length but limited lateral quickness. Good but not great (yet)."
"Jamychal green, Facu, Jokic, MPJ all missed wide open 3s and shot well below their averages. Bench shot horrendously too. Not too worried about a bad shooting night and and a shitty call that killed momentum and took away a 1 point game leading to our second loss in 11 games."
I feel like jamychal green is usually automatic from the corner
"Not really sure about that honestly. Sure with Kawhi and PG in theory they have dudes they can throw at LeBron, same as the Nuggets can throw AG, MPJ, PJ Dozier and maybe JaMychal Green / Millsap at LeBron... but the Clips realistically dont have a guy they can put on AD. For the Nuggets, at least Millsap guarded him well last year in the playoffs statistically and if worse comes to worse they can try GIANT lineups with JaVale McGee. Joker can also hang with AD when AD is at the 5 (and statistically got the better of him on offense, shot 10-17 (ish - might have been 9-16?) against him in the WCF with like a 5:1 A:TO ratio).   I'm just saying that no team truly matches up well with the Lakers. The Nuggets I think actually matchup better than the Clips on the whole defensively at least. The Bucks are close as well, though Khris Middleton leaves something to be desired defensively. He's solid there but not as physical as AG or as athletic, to say nothing of fully engaged Kawhi of course."
Jamychal Green revenge game
We've trimmed a lot of fat but JaMychal Green was not fat.
"3P% is only part of it, there's also release speed and height.  Some good shooters have slow releases so it's easy to run them off the line even if you don't guard them tightly. Examples are JaMychal Green and Malcolm Brogdon a couple years ago (he is better now). Guys like this don't provide great spacing because teams are still fine with helping and recovering off them.  The statistical signature of this kind of guy is high 3P%, but low 3PA / 100 possessions.  A good spacer needs both accuracy _and_ volume"
"What? MPJ missed a third of the season. Murray was never healthy and missed time all year. Their second best guard behind Jamal is Barton who has been injured most of the year and is out right now. 3rd best guard is Monte Morris who has missed a lot of time and is currently out. 4th best guard is Facu who missed a lot of time earlier in the year. 5th beat guard is PJ Dozier who missed a lot of time. Our two top bench guards at the moment were signed off of the street after the deadline. Gary Harris barely saw the court for us this year before they traded him for a  loss (Hampton was to get Gordon and the 1st to take Garys contract as part of it). Paul Millsap missed a few weeks. Jamychal Green missed a few weeks sparsed out and has played through injuries.   The only rotation players the Denver Nuggets have who haven't missed significant time this year are Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon (who they traded an injured starter for), and two guys signed midseason as reactions to both a starter and his backup going down at the same time.   And just to throw the math out there:  Players lost to injury this year so far:  Clippers - 10 players missing 148 games between them  Nuggets - 14 players missing 164 games between them."
"Let me guess, this is the first video you saw about Jokic and MVP in the same sentence? Dude was never like ""I'm the best""... He called JaMychal Green the best player in the NBA, even though Jokic had a better game than him that day."
He gave that franchise everything he had and it‚Äôs unfortunate Fertitta couldn‚Äôt reciprocate by going into the luxury tax to bring back Ariza or even trade for JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple at the 2019 trade deadline
"If they can get a more experienced veteran 3 and D and power forward it could potentially spark great things for the Wolves. If they fortunately keep the kick they have to GS, Mobley could even be one of the closing players in those lineups.  I feel like someone like Daniel House, Danny Green, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes, JaMychal Green, etc would be good free agent or trade targets for boosting their defense and experience."
JaMychal Green?
"not just lou and trez. pat was literally our only good defensive guard and he was out for one series and on a minutes restriction in the 2nd; this led to both dallas's and denver's bench guards killing us. combine that with shamet's shooting struggles and jamychal green ended up being our only consistently positive bench player (lou actually was sort of decent because he was still a good playmaker).  by contrast, people clowned on the lakers roleplayers all season, but they ended up really stepping up and playing well in their roles during your championship run. depth on a contender is less about ""talent"" and more about fit and basketball IQ.  anyway, i agree that this season our roleplayers make a lot more sense in terms of contributing to a championship team. kennard will probably end up being the odd man out of the rotation unless we get fucked by injuries, due to his defense like you say--though he may still have a use as an offensive spark plug if our other guys are shooting cold."
Our coach also likes to counter the Warriors not having a real center by playing small ball with JaMychal Green and Millsap playing the front court when Jokic is out. We traded for Javale McGee so he could pass out the orange slices and Gatorades at half time.
I mean we just lost our 5th guard out of our top 5 guards in the preseason depth chart so that time may be fast approaching.   We‚Äôre literally playing a Shaq Harrison-Austin Rivers-PJ Dozier-JaMychal Green-Jokic lineup rn fml
"I agree jokic himself says JaMychal Green is our best player, he's the MVP"
Just give the MVP to JaMychal Green and be done with it
"Jokic: ""JaMychal Green is the best player on our team"""
"Reporter: So you're getting a lot of MVP buzz, how does that make you feel?  Jokic: Idk, I think JaMychal Green is our most valuable player"
Y‚Äôall would be better having a guy like Jamychal Green or something as your back up 4.
Shades of Jokic's bounce pass vs Minnesota this year through 3 dudes down to JaMychal Green. Pretty cool!
JaMychal Green :(
JaMychal Green erasure
Reporter: People are saying you are the MVP this year  Jokic: The best player on our team is Jamychal Green
JaMychal Green is a terrible defender jesus
"But they already had Millsap. I think you mean JaMychal Green. My guess is that because of the Lakers, Nuggets wanted to maintain size over switch ability, hence why the panic to get Green instead of keeping Craig."
Jamychal green
"That's pretty much what Denver Nuggets were turning into. One or two injuries away from a Campazzo, Shaq Harrison, Zeke Nnaji, Jamychal Green, Jokic starting 5."
How come no one ever talks about JaMychal Green joining the team that came back on him from 3-1 like KD ?
"Danny Green, Jeff Green and JaMychal Green should all form a Mecha-Green and see if they can take out the Suns"
The issue really is having him on the floor at the same time as Aaron Gordon. He makes more sense with JaMychal Green
nooo i want you guys to do it üò≠ at least one game for my guy jamychal green
"Literally all of it was: omg Doc didn‚Äôt play Zubac and Jamychal Green more, he lost them the series"
"Joker also said jamychal green was the best player on the nuggets. Said Austin rivers was. He praises everyone to be fair.  What the other guy is talking about is joker shot some WIDE open 3‚Äôs and missed, same with mid range.   What the other guy misses is the shot selection he forces him to take"
I‚Äôm being obtuse? The guys you listed are all thoroughly outplaying the guys i referenced. MPJ is in the same role as Seth Curry because he can‚Äôt create anything for himself and relies purely on outside shooting. Tobias is a solid three level scorer and a  fringe all star and you‚Äôre comparing him to jamychal green and monte Morris who are both bench players. The start of this argument is you saying Embiid has had a better fg% and then saying he has no offensive help. Regular season has no bearing on how a player performs in the postseason. This postseason Embiid has had objectively better teammates and has faced markedly worse teams than Jokic has. So address the argument or just admit you‚Äôre a moron who hasn‚Äôt watched a nuggets game
"MPJs shooting percentage right now in this series is 36%. He‚Äôs averaging 14 ppg. Jamychal green is averaging 5 ppg on 40% shooting. Monte is averaging 9 ppg on 30% shooting. Again, re you trolling or are you just incredibly stupid? These numbers aren‚Äôt even hard to look up. And why are you acting like Embiid is the only offense when it just so clearly isn‚Äôt the case. Please watch these games before making these embarrassingly stupid comments"
the AG trade looking bad rn. hes lightskin JaMychal Green
"we got millsap locked down after JaMychal Green signed with us  i guess they determined that the remaining free agents wouldnt really do much for the team, but then again it's the same guys who determined torrey craig couldnt find a spot on the team either for some fuckin reason"
Jamychal Green is just a body out there. I never notice him unless he fouls someone.
"&gt;I‚Äôm gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not ‚Äúcheap‚Äù  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn‚Äôt the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn‚Äôt he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren‚Äôt cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren‚Äôt exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don‚Äôt have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don‚Äôt have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don‚Äôt trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don‚Äôt know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I‚Äôll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there‚Äôs a high chance of us bringing back. So you‚Äôre talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that‚Äôs 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you‚Äôre in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that‚Äôs fine.   Now I don‚Äôt even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we‚Äôre talking about the Lakers."
"&gt; Who ever gets high value guys for cheap? You want ring chasing veterans, which is what we got last year, lol.  I‚Äôm gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year. Under that, we have:  Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.   $6 mil or under is everyone other than Augustine, Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  All guys that were available last year. Obviously some of them were restricted, and most of them have outperformed those deals and will probably get slightly better ones next time around.   The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions."
"Starting 5 is Murray/Barton/AG/MPJ/Jokic with Monte Morris, PJ Dozier, and JaMychal Green subbing in and out on a fully healthy roster. Facu averaged 9 minutes a game before Jamal went down and Rivers wasn‚Äôt on the team"
"Gordon expires after next year. We‚Äôre losing Monte Morris, McGee, Millsap and Austin Rivers this year. Will Barton and JaMychal Green have player options but Barton would be dumb to walk away"
jamychal green lowkey reminds me of cj
"&gt;he‚Äôs worth way more than the MLE  I mean, not really?  Did Trez have an above average season, yes.  But 1) fans discount defense in favor of offensive stats and 2) fans also don't seem realize the contracts of certain role players.     This year, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka, and Tristan Thompson all made MLE.  They don't necessarily put up the numbers that Trez does, but they are all likely more reliable players for a playoff team as they aren't huge defensive sieves.  The year before that, Seth Curry, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all signed for roughly the full MLE, while other good players like Bullock, JaMychal Green, Richauln Holmes, and Rodney Hood all signed for less.     Literally every single one of those guys has an argument for being a more useful player for a contending team looking for playoff success than Trez.  Trez absolutely has a market, but it's smaller given his playstyle (which is good for the regular season, but difficult to play in the playoffs).    Saying that he deserve ""way more than MLE"" is silly, because substantially more useful players get MLE all the time."

"jamychal ""steph curry"" green."
What I‚Äôd do to still have jamychal green on the clippers. Damn you doc
i feel like jamychal green is way more important to the nuggets than anyone knows about except nuggets fans
"Mpj,rivers,gordon,morris,jamychal green are all good shooter wtf are talking about"
"I don't guy why he gets blamed for us not having any depth. He is who he is. A good shot creator, a very good shooter and a poor defender.   He can be in the rotation for a playoff team, we don't have the luxury to do what Denver did where they could sit MPJ for the 4th quarter and ride with JaMychal Green instead. Our back up forwards are harry Giles and TJ Leaf lol.   Short doses of Melo is a formula for success but we have to play him way more than we should because Kanter is the worst defender in the league so we had to go small when Nurk was fouled out or in foul trouble."
"All I'm saying is that people should give Jokic's teammates a little more respect. He for sure makes a lot of space and elevates his team. He's a big guy who seems like he can do literally everything. However...  In the regular seasons Aaron Gordon, Austin Rivers, JaMychal Green, and Paul Millsap have been putting up similar numbers on different teams for years. MPJ was one of the top prospects in 2017 and a first round pick. Jamal Murray is already good. Will Barton's numbers shot up as soon as he joined the Nuggets, before Jokic even joined them.  It's harder to tell with Monte Morris, Facundo and Markus Howard because they've only ever played with Jokic but I assume he just makes them better when he's on the floor with them, so you could be right about them."
"Try to look at it this way, the main media narrative is to say ""Jokic single handle is going to win the MVP"", ""Jokic doesn't have any help"", ""Look at the lineup Jokic just won playoff series with""   Now the coach, in effort to give a compliment to his best player, impulsively says a bunch of old guys who couldn't play in the NBA when they were young men, can don a jersey as middle aged men and be competitive as long as they have Jokic.    It feeds into the narrative of minimizing the contributions of Jokic teammates. Clearly he knew as soon as he said it, it's not a good narrative to push out there. It wasn't just Jokic hitting three pointers on the road late in the game (Austin Rivers) or point guards coming off the bench stepping up to score 28 points and 22 points (Monte Morris). Many of his players are guys working hard to establish a reputation as belonging in the league. (Campazzo, Morris, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Markus Howard). Their playoff run doesn't happen nor continue without consistent benefaction from those players.  Malone's comments should be cognizant of the hard work contributions of those players to push back on the narrative to champion their cause. Malone wouldn't like it much if a player used the old Jerry Jones line during their 90s Super Bowl run, ""anybody can coach this team"".    Clearly you're a big fan of the team. Famdom doesn't give accessible  privilege of insider access to private conversations or thoughts. It's also impossible to summarize how every coach in the league is viewed unfiltered by their players where you can garner a ranking system to determine ""the most love in the locker room of any team"""

I can't believe I'm saying this but Jamychal Green was HUGE for them down the stretch. Great pickup for them
"Ya I know. But in their place the other guys played really well. MPJ 10-19 with 6 three pointers, and 8-16 and 9 assists from Monte Morris. JaMychal Green didn't shoot the ball a lot but he was +22 for them! If they had Murray playing those 23 minutes instead of Facundo I wonder what damage they could do but what they're doing right now isn't bad at all. They've got depth"
JaMychal Green was such a big pickup for the Nuggets. And Monte Morris is so steady. I hope Portland can get Dame some help.
jamychal green was huge in this nuggets win
"I‚Äôm honestly not mad. We have the better roster and the Nuggets started Compazzo and played Austin Rivers, Monte Morris and Jamychal Green big minutes and we lost. Stotts is ass, Jokic is amazing and CJ gone! Excited to see what moves the Blazers management can pull out they ass."
Bruh is Jamychal Green always this good?
And that‚Äôs despite the fact that he didn‚Äôt touch the ball for like the last 3 minutes because Paul Millsap and Jamychal Green were chucking and wouldn‚Äôt pass to him
"&gt;Jokic allowed the 3rd fewest points per possession against the pnr this year among NBA bigs lol  Where does that come from?  [Source](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/roll-man/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TypeGrouping=defensive&amp;sort=PPP&amp;dir=-1)  Guys I see ahead of him: Wagner, Hachimura, Gafford, Wilson, Looney, Jordan, Davis, JaMychal Green, Gibson, Nurkic, Williamson, Saric, Antetokounmpo, Bryant, Griffin, Birch, Stewart, Cousins, Gordon, Achiuwa, McDaniels, Hartenstein, Kleber, Zubac, Turner, Reid, Millsap, Wiseman  By my count he's 29th among NBA bigs"
Ok take away the two guys we‚Äôll go down the list MPJ&gt;McCollum (close could go either way) Gordon&lt;Nurkic Facu&lt;Covington  Rivers&lt;Powell   Bench  Monte&gt;Simons Jamychal green&lt;Melo Howard&lt;Kanter Millsap=RHJ  Which of these would you disagree with?
"I can‚Äôt believe the Blazers are struggling against a team starting Campazzo and playing Austin Rivers, Jamychal Green, Monte Morris and Markus Howard big minutes."
"No one expected him to play this much or to play this well, not even Batum.  The funny thing is that we probably wouldn't have had room for him if either JaMychal Green or Markieff Morris had signed with us.  We got clowned so hard when Green signed with Denver and Keef signed with the Lakers, but it ended up working out for us."
"MPJ improved a lot but he's struggling with consistency, especially now in the playoffs, which is perfectly understandable considering his age. But even if he played better, I wish that would have been enough for us to truly be better than last year.   Jerami Grant is an excellent two-way player and we couldn't really find a replacement for him. Gordon is good on defence but sometimes invisible on offence. Jamychal Green is okay as a backup but nothing more. Milsap is one year older and he can give you a quarter of good basketball every like five games but that's it.  People forget how important Gary Harris was last year. Him coming back from injury turned that series vs Jazz. Murray balled out but we actually lost one of those games where he scored 50 and then won the last two with Harris. Craig was great on defence as well and our replacements for him are PJ Dozier (injured) and Zeke Nnaji (not playing).  Plumlee had his issues (AD buzzer beater flashback) but he was a solid backup big overall and we couldn't find a replacement for him. Javale isn't playing much and we usually go with Green at five which isn't working that well.  Campazzo is a positive but he's not much of a scorer and we need scoring badly. He would be a backup with Murray healthy but our bench is terrible at scoring anyways, so he wouldn't contribute much on that end anyway. Morris is playing worse than last year. And yeah, Barton is injured again although he might come back in the next few games."
You had to have watched the games. His decision-making and defense were utterly abysmal. They're still not great but he honestly was unplayably bad.  The problem in the Nuggets series was Doc played Harrell over JaMychal Green.
Jamychal Green was solid
low key JaMychal Green
"&gt; you mix the way the Clips ducked the Lakers this year, overvalued zubac, scapegoated doc and trez and I don't feel like basketball people are calling the shots.  While these are valid points, I would just like to add some context.   * Trezz was a huge defensive liability for us and his ego far exceeded his value to the team's success. I actually prefer the combination of Batum, Ibaka, and Rondo to Trezz, Jamychal Green, and Lou Will.  * PG and Doc were never going to get along, so one of them had to go (I would have rather traded PG for like Jrue Holiday or something).  * And yeah seems like Zubac doesn't have the BBIQ to really contribute as much as he could."
"To expand on this, the Suns signed him using the non-taxpayer mid-level exception, which is the main way for over-the-cap playoff teams to add role players in free agency.  The Suns used theirs on Crowder, Portland used theirs on Derrick Jones Jr, we split ours across JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2-ish), Utah used theirs on Derrick Favors, Boston on Tristan Thompson, Toronto split theirs across Aron Baynes (7) and Alex Len (2-ish) and Washington used some of theirs to give Robin Lopez 7.2  Just looking at what other teams did with their MLE last year, I would bet Crowder had other bidders and Phoenix had to go the 3 years to bring him in."
"I agree that the Clips kind of sold their soul to get Kawhi and PG. They had such a promising mix of young talent and good veterans like Lou Will, Montrezl Harrell and JaMychal Green. I was so disappointed they traded away Tobias Harris, Shai Gilgeous Alexander and Landry Shamet. That 2018 team was awesome to see, it felt like those young OKC and Warriors teams before they found real postseason success.   They technically replaced them all pretty well on paper, but they lost a lot of chemistry in the process and I don't think Kawhi and PG have been a great fit in personality or leadership.  If things blow up this year which I'm kind of hoping they do, I'd be excited to see how they can refresh with Mann, Kennard, Zubac and others. They have pieces where they won't be a dumpster fire like the post-LeBron Cavs, but who knows what happens."
"Yes! Trezz and Jamychal Green were good against Looney, who is an undersized center that can‚Äôt shoot. It was an ideal matchup for them and there was less tape of the Lou-Trezz pick and roll (had diminishing returns each year).  Why exactly is Trezz falling off one year to another and Zubac as well? I‚Äôm going to have to assume it‚Äôs based on the matchups but it‚Äôs hard to say ultimately."
IF THEY PLAYED JAMYCHAL GREEN MORE MINUTES THEY BEAT THE NUGGETS  /s
"&gt;Remember it‚Äôs all Doc‚Äôs fault for making PG hit the side of the backboard and his bad rotations.  No, but it is Doc's fault for putting 6'8 Montrezl Harrell on Boban. It was Doc's fault for letting Reggie be the single defender on Luka's last minute shot. It was Doc's fault for not calling timeout until after the Clips blew their 20+ point lead. It was Doc's fault for not trying Jamychal Green on Jokic instead of letting Trez get eaten alive. And it was Doc's fault for giving so many minutes to Trez last season over Zubac."
"Their choke last year falls on Doc and his stubbornness.   The man refused to acknowledge the matchups against Trezz and insisted on playing Trezz heavy minutes over Zu and even JaMychal Green. Add to that that Trezz didn't play in 1 bubble game and started straight into the playoffs, playing extremely rusty.   I can't blame Trezz though, guy was trying his best."
Man Jamychal Green has played with so many people.  He's the link for so many Denver Nuggets.
"Facu, Shaq Harrison, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsapp, Javale, Austin Rivers. They‚Äôve all been plus defenders. The fact you said Jamychal Green is a good defender kinda diminishes what you said."
"Blazers have better defensive role players, that's for sure.  Covington, DJJ, Powell, Hollis-Jefferson are all good defenders.  Who's good at defense on the Nuggets? JaMychal Green and Aaron Gordon?"
"It was mostly Jamychal Green at that point, as Hartenstein had fallen out of the rotation.  It's worth noting that it still isn't Javale, who has only logged 6.25 minutes per game (rounding up) since the trade.  It's still mostly Jamychal/Millsap backing him up in small ball second units, with the exception of last night's game where he was finally operating as the true backup.  He got big minutes two nights ago as well, but that was starting alongside Jokic and having them alternate who plays center on offense/defense"
Man I'd love to have him he'd be a better JaMychal Green
"players who get wishfully compared a lot to Draymond Green because they are pretty skilled, they look like they are too small to play center a lot but center is still probably/aspirationally their best position, and if you squint hard they seem like maybe they could be multi-position defenders  Tier 1 - Draymond Green, ŒüG Anunoby, Ben Simmons  Tier 2 - Onyeka Okongwu, Daniel Theis, Aaron Gordon, Zion Williamson, Robert Covington, PJ Tucker  Tier 3 - Grant Williams, DJ Wilson, JaMychal Green"
"How do you mention people like Bol Bol or even JaMychal Green and just leave out Dozier?  Forget that this post as a whole is stupid, that‚Äôs definitely the worst part"
I disagree. I don‚Äôt think Jamychal Green would be that good for them.
&gt;What moves would you make to make the Wolves competitive again?  Well you have to ride with this group because I don't see any good vets signing with the Wolves this year (if we make the playoffs next year I can see some of them buying in).   What moves I would make? Try to get Larry Nance Jr. or JaMychal Green since they are the only realistic targets.
"Yeah, I get your point, but if you offered me Jamychal Green or Kevin Love for $1.5m, ugh, I might have to take Green. I'm just a huge Lebron fan since I was a kid and those Cleveland Love years scarred me for life."
&gt;  Fizdale was trying to throw away the old style of Memphis and Gasol was trying to keep it.   That's not quite what happened. Gasol was quite happy to incorporate Fizdale's style into his own game. He had taken 66 3s prior to being coached by Fizdale and took 268 Fizdale's first year. Marc's best passing and scoring year was the first year under Fizdale.   Then the second year Fizdale pushed Zbo and Tony Allen out and replaced them in the rotation with a bunch of 3 and no D scrubs like Ben McLemore and Jarell Martin or Fizdale's buddy Mario Chalmers.  Mike Conley goes down and suddenly the team is reliant on Marc and a bunch of scrubs plus a bunch of passable roleplayers like Tyreke Evans and Jamychal Green.
Jamychal Green comes off the bench already drenched in sweat.
"Covington, Powell, and Jones Jr. come off the books after next season. That‚Äôs $32 million in room to sign a swingman over 6‚Äô6‚Äù to play the 3, and a weak side defending, 3-ball shooting PF.   Jimmy Butler, KD, and Julius Randle, JaMychal Green, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bamba, Okongwu, and others will be available.  Dame should be patient and wait a year, and if they don‚Äôt make moves at the deadline next year, then consider asking for a trade."
jamychal green deserves an honourable mention at least
"(Nuggets fan btw)  **PERFECT:** The Kroenkes hold true to Tim Connelly's statement of being willing to go deep into the luxury tax, and we pick up somebody like Norman Powell, while Barton declines his player option. MPJ Extension gets done, and he develops his ball handling skills and defensive ability.  Jamychal Green opts in to his contract. Sign some backup center who can rim protect. Murray comes back healthy mid-season and returns to form by the start of the postseason.  **REALISTIC:** Will Barton either picks up his contract or declines and returns on a \~15M APY deal. We give MPJ the max. Re-sign Austin Rivers to a relatively inexpensive deal. Sign a backup 5 like Tony Bradley. Otherwise, run it back with current squad. Murray returns by the postseason, but won't return to his pre-injury form until the 22-23 season.  **WORST:** Will Barton and Jamychal Green decline their player options and leave for another team, while the front office doesn't do much to find replacements. MPJ declines any contract offer we put on the table this offseason forcing him to enter RFA in 2022. Murray never returns next season at all."
You have almost all your picks and a good young player in MPJ. You also have Aaron Gordon/Jamychal Green/Will Barton (if he opts in) to match salaries and Monte Morris on a team friendly contract.   Although I would probably move Murray instead of MPJ because Lillard and Murray will be essentially playing the same role.
"Lol Jamychal Green game changer? Gtfo.  Everyone acts they know what would‚Äôve been better, imagine him not playing Simmons and they lost, it would be the same narrative"
Some person force him to not play jamychal green last year? or to put ben simmons and dwight on the court at the same time on a must win game 7?
"Yeah there aren't _that_ many full MLE slots, since a lot of teams like to save 2 million or so to sign their second-rounders for four years (otherwise they can only sign them for 2 years, like Lakers with Horton-Tucker), and a lot of the contenders (who don't care as much about their second-round guys) only have the tax-payer mid-level.  Like this past year we split the MLE between JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2.x)."
"You just made me realise there are no Greens left, now that Danny, Jeff and JaMychal have been eliminated this round. First time since 2012 there has been no Green in the finals."
harden had KD and Kyrie and didn't get out of the second round. Jokic had MPJ and Jamychal Green and got as far in the west. these 2 players aren't comparable lol.
JaMychal Green isn't really a small player though tbf. He's very strong in the post
"When Jamychal Green was on Jokic we had a good momentum swing, but Doc was in love with Trezz for some bizarre reason."
"I agree that's the issue for the most part, but I'm not entirely sure that the league is heading in that direction in such a dramatic way that we will see a ton of teams like this series' Clippers.  Ultimately there are few things better than a star big man, and even guys like Sabonis, Nurkic, Valanciunas, and Lopez could have really done some significant and consistent damage in the paint vs. that line up. Let alone guys like Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, or KAT.   I think the problem can be alleviated in a couple different ways. One is Gobert just getting one singular post move. He can get into the key and call for the ball and get it any time he wants vs. Batum,  keep the ball high, and have some sort of drop step move or baby hook if we're being very optimistic. He's gotta have at least one thing he can go to.  Second is Mitchell needs to significantly improve his playmaking. Rudy gets involved on the offensive end so much more and much more easily with a healthy Conley on the floor setting up lobs, little dump offs, and short rolls for him. Mitchell has not been able to do that with any regularity or consistency, and he needs to be able to. On top of becoming a way better defender, but that's another issue.  Additionally Utah needs to sign an actual back up ball handler because if Conley isn't in the game then your play making is really poor. Mitchell isn't great at it, Clarkson is horrible at it, so you're left with Ingles being your point forward and he just is not gonna cut it. Maybe they throw cash at TJ Mcconnell or something in the off season.   They also need to get a dynamic 3/4 defender to plug up a lot of holes on defense for them, and I suppose primarily to avoid situations like this. Someone like a Covington, a JaMychal Green, or Crowder who can effectively guard 3s and 4s in a normal game situation and mirror Batum as a super small ball 5 if that pops up again. Bojan can't do that, Ingles can't do that, Favors can't do that, and you can't clone Royce.   Gonna be a real interesting off season for the Jazz."
sorry JaMychal Green isn't good enough to go by JMG
"It just needs to be a stretch 5 someone like millsap, jamychal green or batum would be fine cheap options if the rest of the team is good"
"Or maybe teams should be more realistic about win now. I agree with the clippers, he messed up a ton not playing jamychal green more minutes in that series. But I don't buy that this team in Philly is a ""win now team"", they've always had postseason question marks with Ben simmons existing as a liability, regardless of whether they improve their spacing with Seth curry or not. Even if they do end up coming back and winning the title in this injury laced year I still won't believe in the true strength of this roster due to the limitations from the talent standpoint."
"Only in that he has some pretty out there ideas about vaccines and stuff, which I don't know how solidified they are. At least he got vaccinated.  As far as a dude and a teammate he is the complete opposite of a douchebag. He is one of the first guys off the bench cheering for other guys, all his post-game conferences are really well spoken and measured and gives the credit to his team and the coaches for a ton of positive things he does. Always big upping the guys and talking about how good they did if they had a good game and how important they are.   There was a situation last year where he was having a good game and during his minutes on the bench JaMychal Green came in and was having a great stint on defense, boards, offense, and the team went on a run. When MPJ would normally come back in he told the coaches to keep green in because he was cooking and he continued to play strong and we ended up winning, in large part due to that.  He definitely knows how good he is and isn't afraid to be blunt about it, but he's also very aware of when he fucks up and is pretty hard on himself and does not shy away from taking responsibility. I think people just remember him saying that stupid thing in the bubble about getting the ball more or whatever and assumed that's how he really is.  OFFICIAL: Not a douche."
Jamychal Green? I'm definitely not the only dude to call him that
He looked awful and old last year. Denver‚Äôs Jamychal green/milsap bench front court is part of the reason Denver lost last year. He‚Äôs simply just a bench presence who will play spot minutes from here on out
"The others just aren't talked about much. There's lots of guys that you just shrug and say ""seems fine...""  Will Barton, Alec Burks, Alex Caruso, Khem Birch, Torrey Craig, Gorgui Deng, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte Graham, JaMychal Green, Furkan Korkmaz"
"I'd agree that Jokic is average/above average in the playoffs, but has struggled more in the playoffs thus far.  I think him and Curry are very similar defenders. Both very active, both great communicators, both try hard on that end. Both have physical limitations, Curry his size, Jokic his speed. Both are transcendant on offence, but no doubt an average defending center is much harder to build around.   Do you think the Bucks would trade us Giannis for Jamychal Green and a first?"
We already have Jeff green and jamychal green too
Don't forget they already have JaMychal and Jeff Green now to add to the fun
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
No Jamychal Green?
"You know PJ Dozier is on the team, and he's better than either of those shooting guards you listed.  Also listing Bad Bad as depth is laughable.  Also Gordon is our 3, and Porter is our 4.  Also JaMychal Green is a 4."
JaMychal Green playing SF now lmao
"Draymond Green, Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jamychal Green, Javonte Green, Jalen Green‚Ä¶ who else?"
Also Jeff and JaMychal Green reunited on the Nuggets. They were teammates on the Grizzlies.
Lmao man Minnesota can't even sign JaMychal Green. Don't talk to me about FA woes.
"Didn't they just signed Jeff Green? On top of Jamychal Green and Aaron Gordon, I feel like they just running small."
"Denver did very well. Kept Barton, Jamychal Green and Rivers on good contracts and added Jeff Green for cheap.   The Bulls did well but I honestly think this sets this up to be just *kinda good* for the next couple years adding a good but expensive and odd-fitting Derozan with Lavine. They've been *kinda bad* for a little while so I think they made solid moves, I'm just expressing why I don't think it's a home run."
"Got Austin back on a min, sniped Jeff Green for 5/yr, kept Jamychal on good value. Idk what you're smoking man"

JaMychal Green maybe? Jeff Green? Thad Young?
They could have used either JaMychal or Jeff Green. I don't see the likes of top tier PFs signing with them unless they massively overpay.
Well the writing was on the wall with us signing Jeff Green and JaMychal Green earlier today.
"I already mixed the two up for the past 5 years, but now Jeff and JaMychal Green are together at last. Brothers reunited."
Ppl thinking JaMychal Green is Jeff Green. Lol
Someone explain to me the difference between Jamychal Green and Jeff Green and why the Nuggets got both.
"Damn good pickup for the Nuggets, no indication he was going there from what I saw.  Gordon, JaMychal Green and Jeff Green are three great versatile wing pickups in the past year for them. They need all the defense they can get to help MPJ and Jokic."
Jeff and JaMychal Green
"Fucking bullshit hogging the mid PFs, Wolves could have really used Jamychal Green"
Our options kind of in order of what I selfishly prefer   Lowry  Powell  Match offer on Lonzo:  -Keep Zo  -S&amp;T to Boston for Smart  -Chicago has nothing other than Thad Young that I‚Äôd want back so   Duncan Robinson   Reggie Jackson or Kelly Olynyck or Furkan Korkmaz or JaMychal Green  Dragic  Dinwiddie (meh)  Kemba (kill me)    Most of (except Lowry in the universe where the tempering police veto Lowry to Miami) ‚Äî if not all ‚Äî of these can be done while also re-signing Josh Hart and using the MLE.
"I think we can do so much better than Melo. There are so many quality PFs available in free agency: Jeff Green Batum, JaMychal Green, Craig, Millsap, Kieff. All these guys can play as small ball 5s (which isn‚Äôt a huge need with AD but still valuable I think)"
"He‚Äôs a awesome in transition so he fit well next to Rubio off the bench. Just gets a little lost on offense and can‚Äôt shoot outside of like 6 feet from the rim. He‚Äôs not perfect but if we‚Äôre not getting Nance or Favors or Jamychal Green, I think he‚Äôd be a decent starter"
"Minnesota should be on the list for John Collins (S+T), but I bet he re-signs with Atlanta too.    My prediction is Minnesota will sign or trade for a F/C that no one thinks they‚Äôll get.  Could sign JaMychal Green to the MLE, could trade for Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Jonathan Isaac, etc.     Something is definitely in the works."
Wolves will probably get a jamychal green/Paul millsap type at best. I‚Äôd be happy with that.
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
"Just off the top of my head, guys who are vets and would ring chase for vet min (regardless of how likely). Lots of guys out there, its just about finding the handful needed to play alongside 3 hall of famers.  danny green  james johnson  reddick  millsap  Tucker  derrick rose  jamychal green  avery bradley  mike scott  enes kanter  javale  dwight  stan johnson"
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
"Morris twins ,Jamychal Green ,Sabonis are there"
"We're just talking shooting and nothing else? There's a busload of guys available on the market who are good shooters who probably wouldn't be super expensive.  Carmelo, Ellington, Lou Will, Ennis, Jeff Green, maybe Redick would be willing to make a near-min deal, maybe Korver, E'Twaun Moore, Patty Mills, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Kent Bazemore, Korkmaz, Otto Porter, Temple, Terence Davis, and on and on.  Obviously these are all role players and certainly not the elite of the elite, but they're all guys who can give shooting/spacing on cheap deals."
"Honestly the question that makes it difficult is who is the matching salary. You need to be able to send out 30 million bucks worth of dude for Ben Simmons without completely screwing your team post-trade.  For us the matching salary would have to be Aaron Gordon and Will Barton, but like, IDK if I even want to do that trade straight-up, Barton is our starting 2-guard and Aaron Gordon is like 85% of Ben Simmons for 60% of the money. Maybe if the concept is Gordon / JaMychal Green / Zeke Nnaji? IDK, still not even that stoked.  So you kind of have to be like ... who has 30 million bucks worth of slightly overpaid role player that would help the Sixers. Porzingis from Dallas? Cam Reddish and two of (Capela / Gallo / Bogdanovic - who has a trade kicker btw) from Atlanta? Bagley and one of Barnes / Hield from SAC? Hayward from CHA?"
"If the wolves move off beasley (who has shown he can be a good scorer and is on a team friendly contract), I imagine they will likely move more towards a glue guy/defensive player with shooting like Larry Nance Jr, JaMychal Green, maybe Daniel Theis. you can get what Harrell and Kuz give you (ok scoring, poor defense) from alot of places."
"I don't hate the guy or anything and I think he might even put up decent points and rebounds if he got to start at the 4 somewhere, but 538 had him between Solomon Hill, Wes Iwundu, Taurean Prince, Thad Young and Torrey Craig last year. That's what, an 8-10M guy in Thad, a 5-6M guy in Prince, a 3-4M guy in Craig and a couple minimum guys. Kuzma is younger than those guys except Iwundu, but I think you're still talking 20M over 3 kind of deal, though as I said I think if he moved to a non-playoff team where he could be a full-time 4 he would probably put up decent numbers.  As a Raptors fan, if Lowry signs with you guys and we have 19M in cap space, I wouldn't be stoked if we spent 13M of that on Kuzma. The Lakers have apparently been offering him and KCP all over town for a reason, and it's not because LeBron think he's a solid rotation guy. He's shot 40 percent in the playoffs and 28% on 3s in the 5 playoff series he's been in at age 25 and 26.  Though ironically, I think he'd be a good fit for us at forward next to whichever of OG or Siakam is sitting. Kuzma is a tantalizing player, but there's no real evidence he's more than a 9th man. My guess is he goes somewhere, puts up slightly better numbers but doesn't help his team win. But today? I think he's a 7M guy on potential and 5M on actuality. I wouldn't trust him over a guy like JaMychal Green and that seems like a guy who would be overpaid at 10M a year, never mind 13. He's not Marcus Morris, he's a guy who in theory could be."
The wizards nuggets game this year was insane. He clutched up so hard just for jamychal green to give them 5 free throws in two possessions
JaMychal Green rn. Me by next June
His value was also at an all time low though. What JaMychal Green gets this summer will be a good way to gauge Batum‚Äôs next contract. If Green is turning down $7M I assume Batum can fetch $10M+
"They still have Jokic, Murray, and Porter, and *JaMychal Green* opting out is what makes them done?"
That wins wayyyy more than 7 probably. Also jamychal green is better than 2012 dj
"That Clips team is so entirely different. They had Zubac and Montrezl harrell clogging the paint the whole time + Montrezl getting cooked by Jokic. The lineups where they ran 5 out with Jamychal Green murdered the Nuggets, this is basically that on steroids.   The Lakers haven't done anything to suggest they could beat a Clippers caliber team. Nobody they faced in 2020 was as good, and I doubt AD and Bron both play as well. Also Westbrook has been dogshit in the post season."
"I‚Äôd my mind does not fail me he scored 1 field goal in the second half of a game 7 and went 1-11.    It‚Äôs the worst game 7 performance by a star ever, got outscored by Jamychal green, Lou Williams, Trez Harrel, Pat Bev and Zubac. Disgraceful."
"Well just agree to disagree ig. We‚Äôll see how he looks defensively in Brooklyn.  What? There was a literal log Jam between he AG and Jamychal green, all players that aren‚Äôt very effective at any position but the 4. The fact that he played less against the suns just proves my point that Jamychal green was given priority due to his shooting and their need for offence, since Portland was a much worse defensive team than Phoenix was and they didn‚Äôt need to squeeze every bit of offence they needed to out of the team.   There were 4-5 teams that gave millsap interest in FA based upon reports. It‚Äôs possibly they all offered the minimum, since A- he‚Äôs old and B-  few teams had cap left, but it would also make sense for millsap at his age to settle for a minimum to compete for a chip. Guys like Blake griffin and Malik monk took pay cuts to ring chase."
"What? For starters he‚Äôs a great defender. He‚Äôs a post defender/ help defender. He‚Äôs not gonna wow you visually but he‚Äôs gonna elevate the teams defence with his presence. That‚Äôs what the metrics have shown for years and that‚Äôs what teams want defensively.   And he didn‚Äôt get that many minutes in the Denver series cause Denver had a log jam at his position. They wanted to play Jamychal green more due to his shooting since they desperately needed it without Jamal, and they had Aaron Gordon as a starter. Not that many minutes left to go around"
" Danny Green, Draymond Green, Gerald Green, Jalen Green, JaMychal Green"
I am far from an expert but for Denver:  Monte Morris  Will Barton  Michael Porter Jr  Aaron Gordon  Nicola Jokic  **Bench**  Campazzo   Rivers  Dozier   Jeff Green  Bol Bol  Could be forgetting someone and JaMychal Green may end up being in the 10 man rotation
For a while there I had trouble remembering who was Jeff Green and who was JaMychal. I got it now but that one always confused me.
Hard to say in a vacuum  I think Jeff Green is a better fit for us just because Millsap is pretty redundant with JaMychal Green and our bench is desperate for shooting and athleticism.
"Not a star, but JaMychal Green took a huge leap around that age"
"We had a lead in that 3rd quarter with Porter playing, the problem was more in the 4th for game 6 where they went with Jamychal Green at the 4 with Jokic, we couldn't handle that type of physicality inside. Denver, although banged up still had more depth than we did. It was like the reverse of 2019, where we had the more important player out [Nurkic] but we still had enough depth whereby we could make a lineup change mid series."
"I know you said you're casual but we already had JaMychal Green last season.... we just re-signed him is all.   I'm also insulted at our ranking, even with Jamal out. Jokic is a 1-man carry and the rest of the team is young"
"&gt; Do you support Malone‚Äôs lineups and decision, specifically regarding Bol?  Definitely.  You need to prove yourself in practice. And when you enter games, you have to play the right way. It still is basketball. Bol Bol? Black hole on offense, black hole on defense. He doesn't try on D, and just shoots everything on offense, every time. If we had a stat about 3rd stringers vs 3rd stringers, we get murdered almost every time. Why? Bol Bol.  As I stated, I don't agree he has played anything close to ""well"" in his opportunities.  &gt; Do you agree that when placed in the starting lineup against KD, he played very well and with energy and focus?   I agree he tried. That is the thing. You don't get to choose when you try. You have to play hard and the right way every single time.   &gt; Would you also acknowledge the fact that a 21 year old son-of-an-NBA-legend would probably have a strong emotional response to G.I. Malone‚Äôs military style seniority system while he‚Äôs watching guys like Dos Verdes and Austin Rivers make significant negative impacts in positions he can play?  Who cares who's son he is? He has to show _he_ belongs, and that he has the right mindset to be an NBA player. He hasn't shown that. Now, Bol Bol can't even start to thing to play Rivers position. Bol Bol isn't an SG. And Rivers _proved himself in the playoffs_. Remember? We beat Lillard/McCollum. With Rivers.  &gt; You REALLY gonna sit here and suggest that Bol Bol should be eating pine for JaMychal Green or Austin Rivers? Especially when Malone is running a 3-guard lineup with the Geriatric Duo in the front court???  YES! You have to play basketball, a team game. you have to show effort, every single time. YOU ARE NOT A STAR! You don't have _anything_ given to you, never. Bol Bol acts like he is Kevin Durant, and as he doesn't need to do the dirty work. He can rot on the bench with that mindset, he is no good at all to any TEAM with that smug attitude."
"Skip over the points I made to try and use the ‚Äúdo you even watch‚Äù argument. Typical Nuggets fan.   Do you support Malone‚Äôs lineups and decision, specifically regarding Bol? Do you agree Bol has played well in his limited opportunities where he wasn‚Äôt given an extremely short leash (preseason, summer league)? Do you agree that when placed in the starting lineup against KD, he played very well and with energy and focus? Would you also acknowledge the fact that a 21 year old son-of-an-NBA-legend would probably have a strong emotional response to G.I. Malone‚Äôs military style seniority system while he‚Äôs watching guys like Dos Verdes and Austin Rivers make significant negative impacts in positions he can play?   You REALLY gonna sit here and suggest that Bol Bol should be eating pine for JaMychal Green or Austin Rivers? Especially when Malone is running a 3-guard lineup with the Geriatric Duo in the front court???"
"‚ÄúStagnated‚Äù suggests he‚Äôs had a peak to begin with. Imagine being 21 in your third year and your coach still gives minutes to guys like Austin ‚Äúcan‚Äôt play offense to save his life‚Äù Rivers, JaMychal ‚Äúlead footed goof troop‚Äù Green and ‚ÄúUncle‚Äù Jeff ‚Äúgets burned by even the simplest inside offense‚Äù Green, while you rot away on the bench after continually showing out in opportunities. When Bol gains momentum, Malone nips it in the bud and sits him for ages. When he shows out in practice and gets praise from said coach, he receives literally no minutes at all. The Bol hate in the Nuggets community, especially when compared to the praise this derpy fucking coach gets is egregious."
"He demonstrated that he was listening to coaching during the preseason. The way he positioned himself off ball changed/improved a lot. However, it has been hard to develop him. He hasn‚Äôt been easy to slide into the post lineup, because the team works backwards from Jokiƒá, and in the second unit NJ is in love with JaMychal Green.  I‚Äôm a Nuggets fan who has held out hope for Bol. I‚Äôd be fine with the team making a mid season trade if that seems like a good option and teams are willing to take a flyer on him. But first we need to see Murray back from injury to identify what the team would need back in a trade. Being on ice for another half a season must really frustrate the young man, but managing his emotions is part of his job."
"nuggets. got into them because i liked faried and now jokic is one of my favorite players and i love murray, monte, and jamychal green"
"Yeah that's why I can't take the Nugs seriously as a contender, not that I expect Jokic to be out, but because their depth is pretty bad. Relying too much on guys like Campazzo and JaMychal Green"
"Lol stupid JaMychal Green, Whiteside should have just knocked him out"
"Jeff Green, JaMychal Green, Javonte Green, Jraymond Green, who else?"
JaMychal Green*
Jalen Green  Josh Green  Javonte Green  Jamychal Green  Jeff Green
I just don't get why Malone has an offense that pumps out the same amount of 3's for Porter as it does for Jamychal Green
I've never seen JaMychal Green hit a three
"Fun fact Jeff and Jamychal Green are not brothers, but they were also both on the Grizzlies at the same time before, confusing box score watchers everywhere with the ""J. Green"" conundrum"
"&gt; Like they're very redundant. Ideally, (this would never happen), you upgrade Gordon to Simmons and keep the rest of the shooting.  Even the salary-matching here is hard. For it to really work you want to hold onto Will Barton at the 2, so you're looking at like Gordon, JaMychal Green, young guy. Which you can't even execute for a while because of the Gordon extension.  But the Sixers would be after MPJ or Murray so they can go fuck themselves we have Ben Simmons at home.  (If I were them I wouldn't do it for the matching salary above, I just don't think there is a DEN-PHI Simmons trade that makes sense for both teams)"
"People shitting on the Clippers make me roll my eyes; they definitely deserve to be in the top 10.  Everyone only looks at AFTER what happened with Kawhi/PG, but ignore the previous 2 years where the FO made amazing yet unpopular decisions, after another, to get themselves in a position to even pitch to Kawhi. They didn't tank a single season like the Lakers, Thunder, or Warriors, and tried to make the playoffs every year.   They turned the team around in a matter of 1.5 years, from the end of Lob City when CP3 was traded, back to a team qualifying for the playoffs.   They traded CP3 for Lou Will, Bev, Harrell, Decker. Harrell was an unknown quantity at that time, Decker was trash, Lou had been traded like 3 times in 2 years, and Bev is Bev.   Then they traded BG on a supermax despite suffering another mid-season injury for Harris, Bradley, Boban, and a 1st (which became SGA).   Then they traded Bradley for Jamychal Green.   Then they traded Tobias Harris mid-season who was due for a new contact extension the next offseason, Boban for Muscala, Shamet, and the Miami FRP.   Then they traded Muscala for Zubac.  And the most annoying thing is when people say Clippers traded all their picks, and then you still see people surprised the Clippers have FRPs. They traded 3 of their own FRPs, which isn't a lot when you trade for a player coming off an MVP season, especially when the Thunder held all the leverage. The other FRPs came from deals that FO made in the past couple years before the PG trade, which is again a testament to how good the FO is. Miami FRP came from Tobias trade, another Miami FRP came simply from helping facilitate the cap situation to get Butler to Miami."
I'm not mad about not paying Ariza  I'm mad they didn't turn the Anderson contract into a viable replacement forward.  Could have gotten JaMychal Green at the deadline for a very minimal tax bill (but one that would have prevented the league payout) and chose to use assets to duck the tax and get Shumpert (another guard) instead.
Eric bledsoe Myles Turner Jamychal Green Mikal Bridges Robert Covington John Collins Thaddeus Green Dorian Finney-Smith Royce Oneil Reggie Jackson Cameron Payne
Cant wait til (Jeff) Green is being guarded by (Draymond) Green and kicks the ball out to (Jamychal) Green
prolly JaMychal Green
"Aaron Gordon, Will Barton/JaMychal Green, Bones/Zeke and 1st round picks is best Nuggets can offer. Not sure if it gets a star but this is better than what Pelicans got for Jrue honestly"
"""I'm fully vaccinated"" - Nikola Jokic  ""I'm fully vaccinated"" - Jamal Murray  ""I'm fully vaccinated"" - JaMychal Green  ""I'm fully vaccinated"" - Tim Connelly  ""It's a private matter"" - Michael Porter Jr."
"Dude, I'm happy when anyone wants to play for Denver, even when they perform under expections like JaMychal Green has so far. I remember everyone roasting IT when we signed him for a year, but I think we should treat anyone who willingly comes here as well as we can and give them all the chances to work their way into the rotation as we can. The fact that we made almost no effort to include Javale McGee in our rotations last year was super frustrating because stuff like that gives players a good reason as any to NOT sign with us in FA. I think the Jokic success has spoiled fans a lot, and now we're being more picky than we have a right to be. Like do people not get the optics of a very white city booing a black player when we already struggle in free agency because of that reputation? We have a huge burden already to attract quality free agents, we don't need to make it worse by boo'ing our own guys."
"Tillman was going to go into the tax, just not for Trevor Ariza. Ariza‚Äôs contract with the Suns was a huge overpay  If we landed Butler in that trade that almost went through, we would‚Äôve been paying luxury tax.  I do not blame him for not going into the tax for guys like Ariza, Garrett Temple and JaMyChal Green.  The window closed the moment CP3 looked washed in 2019 because Ariza, Green and Temple were not gonna save us  Tillman‚Äôs start as an owner was bad but I don‚Äôt blame him for this.   Everyone wanted Silas and it looked like a great hire at the time. He was heralded as the genius behind the Mavs historic offense  Also IIRC Stone wanted Silas not Tillman (he wanted JVG while Harden wanted Lue)"
"JaMychal Green is trash. I dont understand how Michael Malone watched him play last year and say ‚Äúyeah, I want more of that‚Äù"
"Gordon took too many shots, bones got cocky, Morris didn't look for any shots despite being the third option, Jeff green did absolutely nothing, jamychal was okish in limited minutes, and rivers fumbled a great jokic pass"
Jamychal green
Do you even know what the ejections were or are you just looking for reasons to take shots at the Jazz?  Ingles second ejection was justified but it was him coming in contact with a ref. Donovan's was the same. Both were deemed unintentional contact.  Whiteside was ejected for fighting with JaMychal Green.  Ingles' first ejection was due to a flagrant 2 because he made incidental contact with Davion Mitchell while he was in the air. He was trying to get out of the way.
"Probably either Jeff or Jamychal Green, depending if you want to go big or small."
"MDA/Morey weren‚Äôt fired. We also got a pick for taking on Wall‚Äôs contract, we didn‚Äôt give up picks for Wall  To this day, I‚Äôd say Tillman‚Äôs biggest and only fault was not going into the luxury tax in 2019 for JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple"
Especially JaMychal Green!!!!!!
"Yeah but the problem is its too linear of a stat that doesn‚Äôt take into consideration diminishing returns and stamina. Like if Tacko fall scores 6 points in one minute his per 36 would be 6*36PTS. That shit don‚Äôt make sense.  In a real sense For example, Jamychal Green is a good role player, but then one of the criticisms of the guy is that he has terrible stamina. Going by that logic, if we play Jamychal Green for 36 minutes his production should go bad but since its a linear stat, PER36 will say oh he‚Äôll average more points. I can‚Äôt take PER36 seriously I‚Äôm sorry."
"He would be the perfect 6th man for the nuggs, playing the JaMychal Green bench 5 role, but I doubt he would much like that role and nuggets can‚Äôt afford him."
"people say ""well FAs never come to denver so they might as well spend the money on him"", uh, I'm not looking out for the poor billionaire owners or anything, but it kind of feels like some people don't realise that billionaire owners... prefer not to pay gobs of luxury tax?  if they're $20M, $30M, $40M over the luxury tax threshold, they may very well start cheaping out on other parts of the roster.  maybe they don't use the MLE.  maybe they trade someone away and let their TPE expire.  maybe they get a DPE but choose not to use it.  maybe they let a fan favorite leave in free agency when they had his bird rights and the player was willing to give them a slight discount.  next year, jokic, murray, mpj are all going to be max scale-ish.  gordon and barton are other substantial contracts, and so is jamychal green.  how much are they really willing to spend?  down the road, how hard will they try to duck below the luxury tax line to avoid being repeaters?  it's going to be tricky if mpj's injuries actually become a big issue."
TIL JaMychal Green was on the Nuggets
Have y'all seen JaMychal Green recently
With this quote I really don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt sign Cousins to a vet minimum contract. Nuggets badly need a backup C because Jeff and JaMychal Green are underwhelming and can‚Äôt protect the rim whatsoever. DMC can at least provide a cheap option to increase depth and a versatile skill set along with size.
"Facu, Rivers, Dozier, and two 30+ year old forwards in Jamychal and Jeff Green?  On paper there are some serious issues with the lineup.  Who in the world is going to score the ball?    In theory the bench works *when Murray is healthy.*  Although there is still a notable lack of an actual backup 5.  But when Murray is out, our bench is definitely not ""really good"" even in theory"
Dos Verdes (Jeff Green and JaMychal Green) have been awful this year so far.
"JaMychal Green said recently he's going to add ""Sr."" to his lol"
"All-Greens:  Jalen Green, Josh Green, Jeff Green, Draymond Green, JaMychal Green.   6th man: Javonte Green"
I still want JaMychal Green
