"What would the package be?  James Johnson, WCS/Dwight Powell and a pick for Andre Drummond? I have no clue, just spitballin here"
"It's possible that Embiid will be the only first round pick from the draft to make an All-Star team.   Good second round though: Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Dwight Powell (who was pretty good before his Achilles injury), Jordan Clarkson."
"Our bigs can't rebound - even if they're uncontested. I have 0 faith that a rotation of Boban, KP, Maxi, Willie Cauley Stein, and Dwight Powell could get more than 20 rebounds altogether on a consistent basis."
they are like 3 games out of a playoff spot and 4 out of their top 6 players(and Dwight Powell) have missed roughly half of their games.
You idiot you fell for a Dwight Powell punt fake.
I tend to notice the [games](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/poweldw01/gamelog/2019/) where multiple possessions end in a bricked dwight powell 3
Falling for a Dwight Powell pump fake should be an instant forfeit.
Imagine falling for a Dwight Powell pump fake.
THE DWIGHT POWELL PUMP FAKE HAS CLAIMED YET ANOTHER VICTIM
Bruh how do you fall for a Dwight Powell pump fake **and** fall down
"KP (#2 offensive weapon) was out with the meniscus recovery, Josh Richardson (3a offensive weapon) was out with covid, (Dwight Powell (the only backup center with any pick and roll ability) was out with covid, Dorian Finney Smith (2nd best defender who shot 37% on 3s last year) was out with Covid, and Maxi Kleber (best defender/shooter who is shooting over 47% on 3s this year at the Power Forward position) is out with Covid - all these players have been out at least 9 games. Jalen Brunson (backup point guard and is shooting almost 50/40/90 on 12ppg) was also out with covid protocol for like 5 games."
they dont like lightskins  edit: guys i was joking they literally have dwight powell
"I think there are two or three things that are hurting them. The major one is Rick Carlisle is a elite coach but Dwight Powell sucks and Carlisle just seems to wear blinders for him. He plays with great effort, set quality screens and rolls hard but that's all he does well. He's very bad on defense and he's played a lot. The other and I think they have the personnel to solve this, like finney smith might be a good 4 man against the clippers but he just leaves them too exposed around the rim, especially with powell. The other thing is I'm pretty sure they haven't played one game with all hands on deck yet. When they have Luka, jrich, hardaway, kleber, kristaps starting with a full bench they're gonna be a handful."
At least Dwight Powell looks like he gives a shit out there
"Big difference between missing Seth Curry for 8 games, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott vs missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, and then have Tim Hardaway Jr play through injury."
"2nd-6th best players (Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson &amp; Dwight Powell) have all missed nearly half the season. We've also had the 5th hardest SRS schedule thus far. As of now the remaining schedule is the 29th hardest."
"yeah, i'm not saying he's is not improving, is just that he is being guarded by dwight powell"
As long as it means fewer minutes for Dwight Powell and Cauley Stein im all for it
"Luka had a slow start and when he started getting going, we lost what I think are four of our essential players in Maxi Kleber, JRich, Dorian Finney Smith, and Dwight Powell for 2 weeks and counting now due to health protocols. The first three are starters and provide excellent 3pt shooting and defensive versatility. Without them, our defense has suffered heavily and with no reliable 3pt shooting for Luka to pass to, teams can effectively swarm him on drives since Wes Iwundu isn’t gonna be swishing anything. Powell can catch lobs, which is something that our replacement WCS can’t do, and Boban, as much as we love him, is an absolute non factor and is a negative on defense.  Our schedule as also been absolutely brutal along with missing a lot of our guys. Obviously there are some games we should’ve won that we lost, but the reason for this rough stretch has been due to us losing our starters."
Is that Dwight Powell or something in that video?
"This is a good take. There should be more optimism around Dallas for multiple reasons.   1. as you mentioned, point differential based models had the Mavs as one of the best teams in the west   2. Mavs struggled heavily in the clutch last year largely due to a very young and inexperienced core and also some bad luck. It’s worth noting that Luka was one of the best clutch performers in the league in his rookie year specifically when we had a bigger vet presence.   3. Mavs had quite an injury riddled season with Luka missing almost as many games as Kawhi, Dwight Powell going down with a torn Achilles and Jalen Brunson suffering a torn Labrum and of course KP tearing his meniscus in the playoffs"
"Dwight Powell, we usually start him at power forward, though Maxi is arguably better."
Dwight Powell pump fake
"who do I have to contact to heal Maximillian Kleber, Josuélito Richardson, Dorian “extinct avian” Finney-Smith, and NBPA representative Dwight Powell"
"Add Dwight Powell, play Boucher at the 4."
"I might go with Dwight Powell over Brandon Clarke. Plus Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles, Karim Mane, Mychal Mulder off the bench"
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
"worst part is, he's better than Dwight Powell"
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
"Well Dwight lost his spot when he got that big injury, before that he was really really important piece in the team. He didnt even have enough time to adjust this season and get back to his old form when he was hit with coronavirus. So lets be honest if he didnt have that injury WCS would still be getting 10 mpg, with Powell in the team. I watched his game closely lately , especially vs the centers he played, he makes a lot of fouls and centers just didnt have problems handling him. This is observation without Mavs key pieces, when WCS played 30+ minutes. It works better when he is the backup center and subs out, he actually plays better like that. He lost himself when he left Kings tbh, he was pretty solid there,but that next trade kind of set him back a lot."
"You're taking one game (granted I didn't watch much of the first half) and blowing it up. WCS's more physical, a much better defensive presence, and is longer.  Looks to allow him more opportunities around the rim than Powell got.    Powell's ability to hit a 3 is gone this season and it hardly existed last season. WCS is about the same level of 3 point competency as him as we've seen this season.    You're one of the only ones, the offense and defense has looked better with WCS taking his minutes and Rick usually rewards experience/familiarity. Says a lot how quick WCS has replaced him, granted Dwight will perhaps take time coming off a long recovery."
"Dwight Powell doesn't get brought up often enough in these discussions.   He's owed 30 million through 2023, and after his injury he's literally a 6'10 body out there and nothing else."
"We were missing THJ, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porziņģis is in his 3rd game back. That's 50+ FGA we were missing. Someone had to make up for them being gone. I'd rather have Luka shoot 30 FGA than Wes Iwundu or Tyrell Terry taking 15 FGA apiece."
OUT:  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Tim Hardaway Jr  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson
DNP - Dwight Powell (trash)
Dwight Powell  The Suns  The Knicks
"Dwight Powell, James Johnson and a protected 1st rd pick   or  Aron Baynes, Norm Powell and 2 2nd rd picks"
"Would probably be something like Dwight Powell+James Johnson, salaries match."
"really, mavs fans think dwight powell is not a very good defender? interesting"
"Drummond for Dwight Powell+filler, send it in"
I think he'd be good in Dallas as KP insurance and a much better version of Dwight Powell. Idk how salaries would match tho.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Mavs move for Drummond. Since Dwight Powell is apparently cooked since his injury something like James Johnson + Powell + 2 2nds for Drummond or something. This also gets off the Powell money for next offseason
breaking news: one of the best finishers in the league is better when the paint is open   dude was balling with Shanghai bound Dwight Powell
Idk he was just as good with Dwight powell starting last year and WCS this year
Mavs are 4-0 after taking Dwight Powell out of the starting line up
Nets should trade Kyrie for Dwight Powell
Any rotation with dwight powell
He’s so underrated as a small-ball 5. Basically the east coast Dwight Powell.
Dwight Powell straight up.
"When I watched them they didn't seem that homerish, but they were getting basic facts wrong about our players that indicated a lack of preparation. Didn't know how old Luka was, didn't know that Richardson said he wanted to be traded to Dallas, thought Dwight Powell was a stretch 4..."
we have 1 dwight powell if you insist :) go full offense right? :)
Dwight Powell is soo bad
How was he a throw-in in the Rondo trade? He was our only young asset and was a good young role player. Dwight Powell was the throw-in in that trade
Dwight powell is so washed it’s unbelievable
He's (Dwight Powell) coming off an Achilles injury. Give him time.
"Dwight powell fits none of that description. He cant rebound for shit, cant rim protect, cant really switch, cant guard the post, isnt even explosive for lobs anymore...which was all he was elite at.   Right now he is a Gleague level player and this is comming from a mavs fan."
I really can't believe Dwight Powell only get 3 rebounds per game
"I remember a lot of analysts thought he was going to get way overpaid and Dwight Powell ended up singing for more than him. He just does too many things well at such a low usage, in a lot of ways he’s like the Mavericks pj tucker."
Does Dwight Powell look like a Pixar character to anyone?
Dwight Powell playing so well he got benched and minutes taken away
"""I'm impressed with how well Dwight Powell has been playing""   Uhhh who wants to tell him?"
idk if he counts cuz of injuries but Dwight Powell
Gimme Dwight Powell  Team so far:  Sato  Powell  Jalen Smith  Aaron Nesmith  Shamet  Svi  Layman  Isaiah Joe
&gt; yet he started the majority of the games after Dwight Powell was injured.  Starting because someone else got injured doesn't disprove the fact that he was given the starting job to begin the season and lost it to someone who played much better in that role.
The Mavs literally didn't play their best non-Dwight Powell lineup in the playoffs.
You say he couldn't hang on to a starting spot yet he started the majority of the games after Dwight Powell was injured.
"3 of the top 5 sounds good if you ignore the fact that he wasn’t in the top 2...  Kinda defeats the purpose of saying he was vital. Another way of saying it is that our offense was great, and almost everyone involved in it had career years, including Seth.   Stupid to bring up a pre-Achilles tear Dwight Powell but seems pretty on par with your whole argument."
Do you know 3 out of the Top 5 lineups did?  Those top two lineups you mentioned contained Dwight Powell too. And we know how the MFFLs feel about him.  https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/lineups?season=2019#tab-four_factors
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"Dwight Powell should be number 1. Love what he brings to the team as a leader and locker room guy but even when he was healthy last year, he had some pretty glaring flaws defensively and as a non-shooter. He just made up for it as a top-tier lob and roll man.  But after the injury, he's been absolutely atrocious. Although it seems like he may have finally lost his starting spot."
Put some goddamn respect on Dwight Powell.
"Really good, but imo a tiny bit too late sometimes. Also Harden throws lobs well for pretty much everyone, Luka needs more familiarity with his roll partner. This season he hasn't adjusted for Dwight Powell's decreased athleticism and initially threw a few lobs too high and now misses a few chances, because he doesn't trust Powell.  Small margin, but Harden has imo the edge."
Luka KP Maxi DFS Brunson Dwight Powell (sigh) JRich Josh Green
"In the East maybe but definitely not the west. And unless you’re interested in Dwight Powell and THJ, there’s not an offer that makes sense for a rental. Finding a trade package for Lowry is tricky for most teams."
"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."
Mavs twitter bullied he and Dwight Powell pretty good. I guess it worked
Dallas should trade Dwight Powell for  him and pair with Luka. That would be fun turnaround 🙃🙂
I can offer one slightly used Dwight Powell
Dunc'd On has been on an anti-Dwight Powell jihad the last few weeks.
dwight powell is so useless and it makes me sad. his injury really fucked him
dwight powell gives me bad vibes like a friend who sleeps on your couch every weekend and doesn’t bother to fill the ice trays when he leaves.
Dwight Powell. That man is going to be a superstar
Dwight Powell is jar jar binks?
Watching the same game and some reason I don't like Dwight Powell. I've probably only even seen him play a handful of times.
The trade was made to clear cap space for Giannis. JRich is on his last year with a player option he will opt out of. THJ is expiring. If we clear those two it's 33M of cap space. Move Dwight Powell it's around 45M. With Seth Curry it's around 37M.
"It was a trade made to make room for Giannis with the backup plan of resigning JRich.   With JRich and THJ off the books and then attach a pick/asset to move Dwight Powell, that would've been around ~45M in open cap space, enough to give Giannis an offer.   It was a high risk (dumb) trade cause Giannis was never going to leave Milwaukee."
"I'll give you credit, because people tend to under-value Porzingis' influence on Luka.  Our team with and without KP is night and day different.  Luka needs the spacing to create, and Dwight Powell (and Maxi and whoever else) is a far cry from Kristaps."
Otto Porter could use some Dwight Powell?
"no, we had a two-headed monster at center - Javale and Dwight. Gasol replaces Javale at starter. People will argue that Trez replaces Dwight at back-up center but they are completely opposite players. Trez fills a hole we had at PF last year which was filled by Kuz and Markieff and a hole at 6th man scorer. Dwight on a minimum would have been the perfect, essentially cost free, back up to Marc and would have let us match up to any lineup (Gasol, Dwight and AD are wildly different centers and would have given us endless possibilities).  We see guys like Dwight Powell take advantage of Gasol when he would have had a tougher time against Dwight. Gasol played 20 minutes last night and we were forced to have AD at center a large chunk of the time which is fine for the playoffs but we want to preserve AD's body during the regular season. Dwight coming in last night and playing his usual situational 16 minutes off the bench would have been perfect. On a minimum contract, no less.  What happens if Gasol gets injured for a stretch?"
"He's incredibly frustrating because he's a player who absolutely *should* be better than Dwight Powell.   He's just not, though."
Dwight Powell tries so hard defensively but he's just so bad at it
And Dwight Powell.....oh wait now I’m sad.
Dallas could send Dwight Powell and James Johnson and some 2nds.
"mavs are desperate to find a way to get maxi out of the starting lineup and coming on as a 7th/8th man  can't even get more than 25mpg with james johnson, dwight powell and willie and bobi as his competition for minutes"
"Murray/SGA/Wiggins/RJ/Olynyk(or Boucher?) with guys like Dort, CoJo, Dwight Powell, Brandon Clarke is actually a decent lineup. That could be a playoff team in the East. Not bad, Canada."
Terrible player now trade him to us for Dwight Powell and some whataburger
Tank and give Giannis to us for a true player Dwight powell
Dwight Powell ladies and gentlemen.
I genuinely believe that 2019 Dwight Powell was better than current Dwight Howard. This is just sad :(
Dwight Powell bro you just shit the bed 3 times in 10 seconds
Powell way too soft to keep up with Dwight.
Dude sprints head first into a standing upright Dwight Powell and a foul gets called on Powell.
Bro Willie and Powell are babies to Dwight. Bring back Boban.
"Dwight Powell does literally the same thing, except he’s a better finisher."
"That’s ludicrous, he’s such a valuable asset. Defense, hustle, playmaking on a good contract?   That being said, are you interested in taking Dwight Powell back home?"
"The lottery ended up being pretty booty, but aside from all stars in Embiid (3), Randle (7), LaVine (13), and Jokic (41), the draft also had numerous starters or major role players: Aaron Gordon (4), Marcus Smart (6), Elfrid Payton (10), TJ Warren (14), Nurkic (16), Garry Harris (19), Capella (25), Bogdan^2 (27), Kyle Anderson (30), Joe Harris (33), Dinwiddie (38), Jerami Grant (39!), Dwight Powell (45), Clarkson (46!), and the legendary Thanasis Antetokounmpo (51)."
"more Theis to Dallas if we're hypothetically giving up KP  a big rotation of Collins, Kleber, the ghost of Dwight Powell, and Willie Cauley Stein probably isn't cutting it"
"Dallas needs defensive utility and Boogie has none of that. He’s one of the worst defensive players in the league rn. He’s also been terrible at the rim.   They don’t need another scoring option, they just need someone to catch lobs and contest shots at the rim.   Basically they need a Dwight Powell replacement cause he hasn’t been himself."
"&gt;	If you guys get a decent rim-protecting and rebounding 5  That looked like it was gonna be Dwight Powell, but I don't think he's up to speed after blowing out his Achilles last year. It was brutal. They replayed it in slow-mo, close-up angles like twelve times."
"Drummond is a good defender, and certainly much better than *checks notes* Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell."
"They are probably exploring a way to change Powell for Drummond, compared to Dwight Powell Drummond is Bill Russell"
"Exactly. The Mavs aren't loaded in the front court either. Their other big mans are Dwight Powell who just recovered from torn Achilles, Maxi Kleber who's more like a stretch 4, and Willie Caulie Stein, who just sucks. And they are still trying to get rid of KP who is on his first year of max contract. Red flags everywhere dudes how can those fans not see it."
Wish we could ship them dwight Powell
It will hurt but we can take Tatum for Dwight Powell
"""They should trade Dragic for Dwight Powell."" -Mavericks"
Idk about worst but james johnson sure is useless for 16 mil. The new Dwight powell too while were at it.
"Saw a trade with Dwight Powell, James Johnson, 2nd rounder. I’d probably do that one."
Dwight Powell and James Johnson for Drummond?
Not much the cavs would want. To match his salary Dwight Powell + James Johnson I guess and then thrown in a 2nd. Cavs can definitely get a better deal.
"Dwight Powell, James Johnson (an expiring) and a 2nd round pick from the Mavs. Give us a trial run to see if he can be great with an elite PnR guy. Look at the looks Luka gets Powell and Cayley-Stein, if he can get those and inhale rebounds for the worst rebounding team in the league, that would be worth a look for the 2nd half of this season. And then if not, let him walk and we have that contract off the books."
"Ignoring salaries and what you'd give up to get him, I'd take Drummond over Willie Cauley-Stein and Dwight Powell as long as Drummond is cool with his usage going way down."
"The 2019 offseason we opened up about 40M of cap room for Kemba and/or Danny Green. We got nobody so we resigned all of our UFA (Dwight Powell) and RFAs (KP, Kleber, DFS) to go over the cap and used the trade exception from the Harrison Barnes deal to ship two 2nd round picks for a sign and trade Delon Wright. Seth Curry signed via MLE, Boban BAE. Later on in the season we used more of that TPE to trade another 2nd pick for Cauley-Stein who didn't play in the bubble and was later resigned. We let the remaining exception which was still around 10M expire.  Then we traded Delon Wright and Justin Jackson and one or two more 2nd picks for James Johnson lol.  Our draft picks this year aren't looking too great so now idk what the front office is gonna do. This is the last offseason coming up before Luka signs his big ass extension."
The decline of Dwight Powell is unfortunate for dallas. He adds a great dynamic for the team.  There’s still a lot of time tho and Dallas needs to be active in pursuit of solid vets to round the team out.  They really need a big body and a solid wing.
Dwight Powell for Simmons or klay
Dwight powell for Ben Simmons. Xd
Watching Dwight Powell play basketball is like convincing one of your friends in high school who’s a star volleyball player to come play pick up games with you.  He generally has no idea what to do on the court besides set screens and jump around all game.
"What are you talking about. Dwight Powell for 11M a Year is pretty solid. He doesn't have the greatest Year because Kleber and Porziņģis play ahead of him, but he in todays league where a Gorbert gets 200M ...33M/3 is a solid Deal.   And Deandre Jordan got a 1 Year Deal and we traded him away quickly."
My man Dwight Powell got what looks like one of the most ill advised extensions ever. Is he injured or something
That Dwight Powell contract was good until he tore his Achilles tbf
"Dallas:   * Missing 5 of our 8 best players for 10+ games with COVID (Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson and Dwight Powell), they've been slow to get back to form. * Missed our 2nd best player for the first 10 games due to surgery. Porziņģis has also been slow to shake off rust but is getting there.  * Most difficult strength of schedule to start the season (first 20-25 games I believe)"
"lmao they aren't even considering Portland who is down 2 starters, or Dallas (who OP even failed to mention) who was missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith for 10+ games. That's 6 of our top 8 guys, plus we had the most difficult schedule for our first 25 games."
"If John Collins is a 10 on the John Collins scale, what # is Dwight Powell?"
It’s like the time the Dwight Powell trade was talked about as the Rondo trade for a while
"&gt;: It's amazing how you can examplify what i was saying so effectively. On-off is more about who you play with then what you are contributing. As you explained so well.  It's amazing you can't understand the difference between on/off numbers between teammates and on/off numbers between #1 guys on different teams   &gt; ach Collins is poor often injured back-up center, the fact that you are counting him as a big ""missing piece"" kind of lets me know where you are at with this.   Bud I literally counted Dwight Powell.  And ""often-injured"" is hilarious when you're talking about Kristaps ""literally never finished a season healthy"" Porzingis.    &gt; Bottom line is that the Mavs have been missing large parts of their staring line-up and important bench guys for most of the season, to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Bottom line is that the blazers have been missing their 2nd AND 3rd best players for 12 out of the 23 games, have missed Zach Collins the whole season, and Derrick Jones Jr, Covington, Hood, Nassir, Anfernee have all missed more than one game.   &gt; to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Well that's just a flat lie because Tim Hardaway has literally played 24 games lmao.  They played maybe one game with no starters?  So same as us."
"I am so happy for Dwight, myself and the few other Powell-defenders, who just wrote to give him some time after that brutal injury. He looks better and with his work ethic that's only gonna improve further."
Dwight Powell is a traffic cone at this point.
"The sheer power of Jokic gives 2014 a good case as the best one also  NIkola Jokic, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson, Glenn Robinson III. Looking at it more yeah it is better than 2012  Issue with 2nd round picks is even the guys who end up good often take years to do so and the team who drafts them doesnt think they are good and ends up dumping them. Crowder, Barton, Dinwiddie, Harris, Grant, none of these are guys who did it on the team that drafted them really."
"No, that cap space was used to resign Dwight Powell who was a UFA and the remainder was to resign bird players DFS, Kleber, and Porzingis to operate over the cap. The trade exception created from Barnes was used for Delon Wright and later on Willie Cauley-Stein at the cost of three total 2nd picks.  Out current potential cap space is mostly due to Tim Hardaway expiring and Josh Richardson who was acquired from Seth Curry who we signed while over the cap."
"the way OP presented the stats is misleading, look at the fouls drawn per 100 poss.   Embiid and Giannis draw 50% more fouls than Jokic. That's a lot. Because this sub lacks the ability to really analyze data, that's like someone scoring 20 ppg and 30 ppg.   Saying he's 8th is also a little misleading because there's a ton of people right in that ballpark of 7.X fouls drawn / 100 poss.   Dwight Powell, Drummond are both at 7.X.   So personally I see this stat as, jokic gets fould drawn at the same rate as big men like Drummond, Powell, less than Bam, etc. Not ""8th in the league"""
"I saw him play for team Canada too, had seats right behind the teams bench. This was all before he came to the league but I found it interesting how Dwight Powell seemed to be one of his best friends on the team, they were joking around together the whole time"
"Yeah, people always talking about Lu Dort, another Canuck, but Brooks is another killer defender who seems at times like he could make a jump on offense, and at least tighten up his 3 and be a real contributor on a contender  After the disappointing passivity of dudes like Wiggins and Bennett, Canada has a whole bunch of bad mfs coming out.  Jamaal Murray, Brooks, dort  + Up and coming SGA,Rj barrett, chris Boucher, khem birch, Brandon Clarke, Nickeil Alexander Walker  + veterans like Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Corey Joseph, Dwight Powell,  Hopefully can run for a silver at next international"
Dwight Powell. Guy can't do nothing on the court. On both ends of the floor.   Also Luka when he goes to the FT line.
"Dwight Powell. This makes me so sad because he’s a great dude, but he lost all his juice with an Achilles injury and just slows the whole game down now."
"Dwight Powell, fuck it hurts watching him"
"I honestly cannot believe that the trade value wasn’t that high. Like, the Mavs could’ve traded a first round pick and Jalen Brunson, James Johnson and Dwight Powell,"
"that isn't true, he scores [less than 1 putback a game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/putbacks/?sort=POSS&amp;dir=1) and they account for about 16% of his total points. considering he makes nearly 2 3's a game at 37%, i don't agree that he's ""always the last guy on the floor"" that they'd want taking a shot, considering at times he's probably shared the court with offensive juggernauts like boban, dwight powell, willie cauley-stein and wes iwundu"
"Ok but have you considered Dwight ""highest ortg of all time"" Powell? Bet you forgot about that"
We need an elite rim runner to pair with Luka. Good guard depth and wing in my opinion. Need someone out there who’s job is just to catch lobs from luka (someone like John Collins would be perfect). Additionally a backup center would be nice (moving off of WCS and Dwight Powell). Another potential solution is to sign someone like Richaun Holmes and start him at the 4 alongside KP.
"For current season, Dallas are bottom 10 payroll in NBA in terms of contracted salaries. For next season, they drop to bottom 5. For 2020-21, this includes $ 23 million owed to JJ Redick (3rd highest) and Dwight Powell (5th highest). No other playoff (or play-in) team in West has a lower payroll this season.  Suns and Nuggets also have payroll under $130 million for this season. However, there are two key differences. Their payroll remains almost unchanged for next season while our payroll reduces to 90 M next season. Additionally, there are no highly paid non-key players on their payroll.  Basically this implies that Dallas will be making key decisions on roster changes at the end of this season. May be this is one of the reasons why Carlisle has been experimenting with rotation players as he needs to evaluate who are worth the final commitment."
"Just gonna copy and paste my answer to the same question last month lol:   Not a mavs fan, but im a firm firm believer that the mavs' roster is just like last year's lakers but worse: all nba wing that plays the main playmaker + offensively gifted big that likes jumpshots + lots of back up big men (dwight powell is abnormally horrendous tho) + scoring shooting guards.  Using my Laker observation skills, the mavs need another playmaker bc luka cant be the only dude running things decisively on offense (jalen brunson is no dennis schroeder or rondo). And the mavs just need to get better at defense + rebounding. Like these mf's have the same-ish tools as the championship lakers, all they need is a scheme to get their plethora of bigs clogging the paint and their wings/guards running n causing a frenzy so it goes back to offense and into luka's hands as soon as possible.   Carlisle's offense has always been a majestic thing but if ur not the nets then dont try to win games/chips solely by outscoring opponents with high pnr's"
He's getting 15mil/year to make 3's and is shooting 38% from 3. Look at Dwight Powell he's getting 15mil/year and doesn't contribute anything to the mavs
"Without looking at Google or the comments, can you name which player came from where?  #Wizards  * Rui Hachimura * Deni Avdija * Davis Bertans  * Robin Lopez * Raul Neto * Issac Bonga * Alex Len  #Mavs  * Luka Doncic * Tingus Pingus * Boban * Maxi Kleber * Willie Cauley-Stien * Dwight Powell * Nicolo Melli * Josh Green"
I don’t think I could hate Rondo as much as he hated playing for the Mavs.   At least we got Dwight Powell in that trade.
Dwight Powell may be the worst rotation player in the league
"I think that is surprisingly easy to answer for the Mavs: Dwight Powell and Trey Burke.  Maybe there is a case for Boban, but he is very situational."
probably dwight powell and willie cauley stein
"1. They are not the defining measure of a PG, but the offense comes to a halt when Luka isn't on the court. Isn't that the PG's job? 2. They brick alot of shots because they aren't getting easy ones at the rim. 3. His primary position is PG but he is shoot first PG that only passes when the clock is low.. 4. 5. They traded away, Curry, Wright, and released Barea while Brunson was still injured. Does that make any sense?  Dwight was available. Christian Wood was available. Dallas as multitude of Centers that don't rebound particularly well. Dallas failed to address any of the weaknesses the team had in the off season. If they didn't you wouldn't see everyone complaining about Powell, WCS, or KP."
"There are a few other Mavericks you forgot: Dwight Powell (Canadian), Boban Marjanovic (Serbian), and Nicolo Melli (Italian)."
Number 9 is a strikers number in football (soccer...) so it’s been a popular number for international players like Ibaka and TParker for example.   Same with the number 7 which is what Doncic would be wearing if Dwight Powell didn’t have it.
"he's good but when you look at his body and length you would think he's this really switchable defender, and he's really not. Against your average sized wing he's really solid but he can get bullied against the bigger/longer guys.  It's kind of the mavs entire problem, pretty much their entire rotation (except dwight powell) are at least average defending guys on ball at their position, but no one can really switch at all"
"YOU FUCKING MORON, YOU FEEL FOR THE DWIGHT POWELL PUMP FAKE"
what player on your favorite team will be playing in Guangdong next year?   i’ll start: Dwight Powell
"I think the only realistic suitor for Drummond was Dallas - who could've offered James Johnson, Dwight Powell and a second or something.  The issue is that Dwight Powell has become a negative contract since his ACL tear. Trading an expiring Drummond to take on a couple of years of bad, 10M annual salary in Dwight isn't worth the second round picks Dallas would throw at Cleveland to try to compensate."
Yeah they are absolutely complementary. Doncic has such a good connection with Dwight Powell in the pick n roll. Imagine what he could do with Zion
dwight powell is the nicest goon in the league

Your team really need culture setter hardworking player that you wont question his effort  Dwight powell is that guy! Lets trade!
"The interest in Dwight Powell makes a lot of sense, that way they still have one player who looks like Aaron Gordon"

Dwight Powell for normal Powell 😤😂
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
"What, if even, would a trade value for him be?      Mavs fans love this thing of dwight powell and a 2nd? Is that ok?"
Did you give us... Dwight Powell?
"""Prime"" Dwight Powell"
Team A rip Dwight Powell
"they got a dpe for him didn't they? think that precludes him playing this year  he's got a player option for next year, that he's unlikely to exercise  his bird rights are probably worth a mediocre but playable player on a moderately bad contract  someone like dwight powell off the top of my head"

"Willie has been surprisingly good for us this season, his net rating when on the court is 10.0. Him and Dwight Powell split time as the backup center depending on the matchup but he’s been really solid"

Who's stopping Jokić over a seven game series? Willie Cauley-stein? Dwight Powell? Boban? Jokic would feast.   Nuggets at least have a few decent wing defenders in Aaron Gordon and Will Barton who can try to slow down Luka.   I think nuggets win this in five.

"Probably James Johnson and Dwight Powell, at least that who the fans that wanted him wanted. I doubt Cleveland wanted to take extra years of Powell's contract. Also Powell has finally returned to his pre ruptured Achillies form and is playing a lot better than Drummond right now. That would have been a huge mistake."
"No there are a few international players as well that don't fit the NBA mold but for some reason do phenomenal on the world stage. Case #1 Pick Anthony Bennett, didn't do well in the NBA but plays well on FIBA stage. Phillip Scrubb and his brother are good.  But this year:  PG // SG // SF // PF // C  Murray // Shai // RJ // Boucher // Olynyk  Brooks // Wiggins // Dort // Clarke // Tristan Thompson   Cory Joseph // Trey Lyles // Alexander-Walker // Dwight Powell // Anthony Bennett   I mean this is a grezzy team. US is a monster will take years to compete with, but sold lock for top 4 in the world with this roster. Even 2nd is possible."

Don't worry, we keep an eye on all our sons. They all have our love and support, esp RJ, Shai, Dort, Murray and Boucher."
"The team just wants the ball handler to have the ball for transition, so they have the other players box out so the transition starts with Luka, LeBron, harden, or Westbrook instead of Dwight Powell, Marc gasol, DeAndre Jordan, or Davis bertans  The uncontested rebounds are meaningless and don't add value, but getting the ball to your primary ballhandler as fast as possible does.  Some stans will argue though because they get hype about triple doubles and don't want to hear anything opposing their love of the big statline since it helps their player look better"
"nets got greedy at the trade deadline with dinwiddie, for sure could have gotten a playable big on a shitty contract like dwight powell"
"YOU FOOL, YOU FELL FOR THE DWIGHT POWELL PUMP FAKE"
"Poor Blake. Trying to get the Grandmaster Dwight Powell to bite on your pumpfake all game long? Come on, the disrespect. Dwight knows your tricks."
"Major props to DFS, THJ, and Brunson for stepping up when Luka was struggling.   Major advocate for Dwight Powell getting all of WCS minutes"
They call Dwight Powell “DP.”   Lol
Dwight Powell is not falling for your pumpfake Blake. He knows. He's a master himself.
Lol at Kyrie boxing out Dwight Powell
"I would say it’s a risk vs reward thing, defensive scheme thing, and just philosophy about the game thing   Realistically you can can say double him every possession but at the end of the day they will adjust. I remember last season the Spurs played him by doubling and blitzing which led to porzingis getting warm up 3s and dropping like 30, the Lakers did the same thing like a month ago and it led to Dwight Powell looking like prime Blake on slips. Guys like Brunson and THJ can create their own offense and play off of Luka getting doubled, DFS and Kleber will knock down the open shots they get. So eventually you’ll just be sacrificing open looks just to stop Luka which isn’t viability for a whole game."
And Dwight Powell had a career game against the Lakers too...
"Help his team??  Are you watching the games??  Luka, Timmy and Brunson are carring the team all season long as a result of guys missing games due to covid, KP missed 20 games so far and there is no timetable for his return, Kleber is banged up since December, Dwight just recently became his old self because he came from an achiles injury.....  Lately DFS is playing well, same with Powell but basically Luka is doing probably the 3rd biggest carry job this season after Curry and Jokic."
He’s been a terrible defender his entire career. More reps isn’t going to stop Richaun Holmes and Dwight Powell from torching him.

I mean it’s just weird if you compare this foul on Dwight Powell that was a flagrant; and the foul on Norman Powell when knockout that Boston player today (Smart if I’m not mistaken). That was a common foul lol.
* Got devastated by Covid * J-Rich is a massive disappointment * Dwight Powell looked like a corpse for 2/3 of the season after his return from the achilles rupture * Porzingis was not ready for the surprisingly early start of the season and is still dealing with injuries. When he plays he has middling performances overall.  The deck was definitely stacked against us...
You fuckin idiot you fell for the Dwight Powell pump fake
Dwight Powell? All he can do is catch lobs from Luka lol. He hustles but that's kinda it
We're talking about Dwight Powell not Dwight Howard...
Did we not watch the same game where the second Drummond came in we didn’t score for four minutes straight? He completely kills us on offense and defense. That play lebron threw the ball out of bounds for example. Mostly on lebron right? Wrong. It was ok drummond Bc he came over completely ill advised and brought a second defender. Bron gets a layup on that play otherwise. He had beat his man.   Then defensively the kings just literally spammed pick and roll bf they knew Drummond was completely lost. Holmes is a good Player but Drummond made him look truly elite. And same thing with Dwight Powell the other night. Literally all Drummond
"Ever since they got Drummond, rim running centers have had field days against the lakers. First Dwight Powell, and now Holmes... Interesting."
I think the Mavs say yes to that deal if you can figure out who #2 is. Imagine giving Luka a DPOY-caliber version of Dwight Powell to run the pick and roll with who can also handle the ball when teams come to trap 77.
Yup but I wouldnt be surprised if a third team gets involved to get Danny and/or Hill (maybe the Mavs send Dwight Powell for DG?)
Why the fuck do we want to verse the nuggets if Alex Len and Lopez and taj gibson and Dwight Powell and any random C in the league are cooking us?
"Because Luka is a transcendent offensive player and the Mavs have one of the scariest ""hot"" rosters in the league. Kleber, Hardaway Jr and Luka can get hot real fast and when they're hot they let hell fire rain, oh also Finney-Smith gets on streaks too. Plus they've regained the essential Luka and Dwight Powell pick and roll which is one of the dirtiest plays in the game. Scary part is they're still missing Porzingis"
Some dude named Dwight Powell is in Dallas
"Honestly part of our problem is our roster Construction and the way we set our starting lineup. Outside of Luka and KP usually Dorian Finney we don't have a lot of players I would label as true starters. No one on our team plays defense and it doesn't seem like a lot of our team understands rotations very well, and we our way over paying a couple players for the production they're giving us. Dwight Powell and Tim Hardaway Jr are making like 31 mill combined too"
"If Luka turns into prime Magic, Porzingis turns into prime Dirk, Jalen Brunson turns into prime Harden, THJ turns into prime Reggie Miller, DFS turns into prime Shawn Marion, and Dwight Powell continues to play like prime Wilt Chamberlain, the Mavs might have a dynasty"
"I know you're joking but Khem is really our only jacked big man. Chris Boucher is a twig, KO isn't very strong, Dwight Powell is kind of a tweener. And it's not like Khem is overly tall, he's just very beefy.  I would guess we are going to be starting Brandon Clarke at C."
Do y’all want fellow Canadian Dwight Powell??? or a lightly used Josh Green or Tyrell Terry???
"wiseman isnt a terrible shooter though no?  I mean he kinda has the skill set to fit that description of a modern day center but he didnt unlock everything (or most parts) of it in the offensive system of the warriors just yet which is expectable given his major lack of experience.  So I'd say given his talent and todays game requirements he could have come into the league (on another team) and totally nailed it, just that the entire situation made this season for him rather a big challenge and learning opportunity. Though imagine his pick and roll talents paired with Luka, I mean if Doncic can make Dwight Powell score 25 against the lakers surely Wiseman could have looked way better than he does on the Warriors."
&gt;Marc is good but he can get abused in a lot of matchups. He’s slow and can’t keep up with any athletic center or a small ball center. He doesn’t abuse his size in the post either.   &gt;He just fadeaways and misses most of the time.  Gasol shoots 47.1% on fadeaways. Drummond shoots 43.8% on layups.  &gt;Drummond can keep up with every center and small ball center. Trez also can to and he abuses weak centers.  Drummond can’t keep up with shit. His defensive IQ is atrocious. Trezz is just horrible defensively.  But he can’t keep up with Dwight Powell...
"To be fair to Andre Drummond here, Dwight Powell and the Mavs broke the Lakers trap on Luka pretty well in the second half. They kept the ball moving and Powell cut to the rim at the right times. Andre Drummond was also trapping Luka partially at times at well.  Basketball defence isn't really one on one as much as we make it out to be. I don't recall Dwight Powell Iso'ing Drummond on the block last night, if he did please link the footage."
"Watch the games.  Those ""guarded by"" statistics are notoriously inaccurate.  Drummond did not get ""cooked"" by Dwight Powell.  Vogel decided to trap Doncic on almost every possession, and left Powell and a few other Mavericks completely unguarded in the lane.  Drummond is a good defender, with excellent active hands, who is willing and able to harass players on the perimeter and block shots on the inside."
I don't know how he's been in the other Lakers games but Dallas exploited the hell out of him in their two game mini series.  Dwight Powell went 15/17 the last two games combined and a  lot of that was b/c Drummond could not cover him to save his life.
"i mean at the time you had an overweight dude from Serbia who had come off of a good year playing in Serbia and who had averaged 3.5 assists. So basically he was closer to a normal center with good passing fundamentals.   Even in his first year in the league you had a guy that was doing 2.4 assists, and while he was very good, was there indicators of him becoming the kind of player he is today (I didn't watch Denver back then). Like even the per 36 numbers his rookie year didn't show that court vision potential off.   For every Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic you end up with a Darko Milicic or Dragan Bender, it's a total crap shoot dealing with the draft and to call these guys idiots when they still had the idea to draft and pick him up still shows that someone viewed him as a prospect with potential.   You can't predict how a player will develop over time, it's pretty idiotic of you to say that these guys are idiots considering they literally have to evaluate 100+ potential players every year that may be worth picking up. 2014 was a draft of underrated gems, Joe Harris and Jerami Grant were both second rounders, Dwight Powell who just put on a show last night with Luka went after Jokic. Potential 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson went at 46. Clint Capela at 25, there were so many great prospects that were drafted all across the board not to mention guys like LaVine and Julius Randle going later in the first round. Everyone is going to remember 2014 for being the a low key bust for the biggest prospects from Wiggins and Parker when in reality it's going to go down as a sleeper draft where some truly elite players went very late in, likely a very difficult draft to call."
Dwight Powell literally dunked on the Lakers and you are telling me he's just an honourable mention???

"As cynic as it is following such a great game by Dwight, but after so many potential 21 free agents extended another part his value is the contract he is on. Partly guaranteed in 22/23 and 11 mio is a good, big enough number. Powell + Kleber + a combination of DFS/Green/Burke/WCS/Brunson/Terry gets the Mavs to 75% of pretty much any contract and not giving up any value to have cap space leaves Dallas with 2 tradable 1sts and a lot of pick swaps.  Powell just increased the Mavericks trade package value."
Your team just lost to Dwight Powell
"He could've but the blame is more on Vogel. They trapped him way too high.   Luka isn't a small guy he could easily hold onto the ball until Powell rolls and raches the ft line and kuz should split the diff.   Dwight is also pretty good on the short roll so Drummond ""could have hauled ass"" but he's too big to keep up with Powell or run to the corner.   Vogel shouldn't have trapped him so high luka isn't super elite at long distance like curry etc. Trapping luka just inaide the line seems to be abetter tactic.  But what do I know Vogel proba knows better."
"TJ is 100% effort, 100% of the time. He is the Dwight Powell of NBA guards."
And he is super well spoken on a lot of off court issues and anytime there is some sort of humanitarian anything Powell seems to be involved. I have always loved having Dwight on our team and I get why some fans felt he wasn't living up to expectations and such but he is going to be such a huge part of us doing well in the playoffs.
"I will say it again. It was not the Rondo trade, it was the Dwight Powell trade."
Dwight Powell happened
"Dwight Powell is not 3 days back from injury like AD and early in the season looked really bad for us. About couple weeks ago, his play started to return (and even exceed) where he was before."
Who gives a shit what Dwight Powell is doing?  Lakers need AD to win another chip and that starts with him not going down at the 5 for some fugacious shit.
Dwight Powell is literally coming off an Achilles tear and he’s playing the 5
"Obviously he won’t play like this all the time, but it’s safe to say he’s fully recovered from the achilles.   For the past 2 weeks or so it’s been clear his explosiveness that was missing early in the year is back. If we get elite rim roller Dwight Powell back that’s huge because he and Luka were dangerous together before the achilles."
"Would anyone had guess that the Mavs would win by 15 and the 2 leading scorers were Dwight Powell and Dorian Finney Smith, not just for the Mavs but the entire game"
"Dwight fucking Powell of all people  Also doe doe was fucking huge, he’s been so good recently"
"It feels so good that Dwight Powell rounds back into shape. These situations are the reason you never trade away a high character, team first veteran for nothing or even negative value on a low point in the recovery process, you would only lose double. Thank goodness our FO knew what and what not to do."
"As people have pointed out, this is one of the main reasons our offense has suffered. We just don't have a great roll man, Dwight Powell is the best but injuries."
Spot the difference: Dwight Powell and prime Blake Griffin
Just what we all suspected. Dwight Powell being Anthony davis and Andre drummonds weakness.
Dwight Powell should go 11-12 from the field more often. I could get used to that
Dwight Powell came ready to play tonight!
I’ll take Dwight Powell
"Imagine having Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond and Marc gasoft only to get outplayed by Dwight fucking powell    LoL Lakers 🤡"
Dwight Powell
I guess Dwight Powell was possessed by the spirit of prime Shaq tonight. He worked so well off of Luka tonight and stepped up big time. Sheesh
Mavs ran the Luka and Dwight Powell PnR the entire fourth quarter and Lakers didn't change shit defensively. Lol
This is the Dwight Powell we were robbed off for 1 year
Imagine Dwight Powell having the game high
Dwight Powell just absorbed KPs talent like a monstar
Cant believe im saying this but Dwight Powell took over in the fourth
"Dwight Powell won the Dallas Mavericks an NBA game almost singlehandedly. Follow your dreams, kids."
"Dwight Powell played like AD, and AD played like Andre Drummond..."
"Be down by 17 at one point in the 1st half. Mount a huge 2nd half comeback and win the game due to heroics by Dwight Powell.  If you don't like that, you don't like Mavs basketball!"
"So happy for Dwight Powell, came out slow after recovery, to the frustration of some fans. His minutes/role are reduced, but he always had support for our team nonetheless. Now his number is called, and he delivered and more."
"Dwight Powell, American Hero"
Dwight Powell &gt; Anthony Davis
imagine getting dicked by dwight powell
Dwight Powell is the best big on the floor just like we all expected
This looks like pre-injury Dwight Powell. O Canada
You know I’ve always been a Dwight Powell supporter.
the lakers are really going to drop to the 6th seed because they can't defend dwight powell.......
Dwight Powell could actually get a 20 pt 10 reb game  What a time to be alive
Imagine letting Dwight Powell turn into prime Blake lmao
Do I actually like Dwight Powell now
Dwight Powell looks like a rejected Lopez brother
Dwight “GOAT” Powell
How has Dwight Powell been this year in general because tonight he’s been a dog
I’ve seen enough. Build around Dwight Powell.
Oh holy shit look at Dwight Powell
"Also Dwight Powell, Nick Nurse and RJ Barrett’s dad had their team Canada training Camp interviews 😃  Oh, not news? Ok 😞"
"Dwight Powell, THJ, and KP will be making 60+M per year. Whoever made those decisions should be made to walk naked around Dallas as people throw rotten tomatoes at them."
Dwight Powell looks solid after his Achilles recovery.
"Lol my comment didn’t even say anything negative about Trae or positive about Luka. And I didn’t bring Luka up, the guy I replied to did.   But it’s an absolute fact that if Luka cooks with Dwight Powell he would murder defenses with Capela and find 3 point shooting every year  There’s a reason Seth, DFS, Maxi, Powell all look their best next to him"
He’s basically a better Dwight powell
"      Following your line of logic, the only reason the Mavericks lost to the Clippers last season is because they were missing Dwight Powell, their starting PF and 4th or 5th best player, and they lacked the tough interior presence needed."
"in times like these, as much as i enjoy dwight powell, i really wonder what would’ve happened if we didn’t trade crowder away"
We had a stacked HOF lineup of:  * Dirk Nowitzki * Chandler Parsons * Raymond Felton * JJ Barea * Wesley Matthews * Zaza Pachulia * JaVale McGee * Raymond Felton * Charlie Villanueva * Dwight Powell * Deron Williams * Justin Anderson * Devin Harris * Salah Mejri * some guy named Evans I think   They'd go toe to toe with the 96 Bulls imo
Rudy Gobert vs Dwight Powell. I mean yeah.
Dwight Powell for sure
"Yeah, I agree. Our team isn't as bad as some terrible teams, but the roster construction is just...really dumb and not a good fit. Why did we trade for Melli and Redick in the middle of the season when our biggest deficits were a mobile defensive big and wing defense (and apparently a secondary ballhandler and playmaker, as we saw this playoffs whenever Luka sat). J Rich should've been a good fit on the team, theoretically, but we should've probably listened to the 6ers fans when they said he wasn't that good--and Donnie Nelson should've known that. Why did we waste like $11 million in cap space in 2019 that went unused? Terrible draft picks and FA signings all around...too many to list, but just wow (except DFS, who has been amazing, and Dwight Powell was really good pre-achilles injury, so I don't have an issue with that). Obviously KP does not fit well on this team if he can't capitalize on smaller defenders in the post or otherwise create efficient offense...and is now not a good defender, either. Mini-rant over lol"
"**Sixers:** McCollum, Curry, Green, Simmons, Embiid with a bench of Milton, Maxey, Thybulle, Reed and Dwight.   **Blazers:** Dame, Powell, RoCo, Harris, Nurkic with a bench of Simons, Little, Jones Jr, Melo (maybe) and Collins."
"He could be an upgraded Dwight Powell in Dallas. When healthy, DP has consistently been one of Lukas best roll men, and Trez is better than DP imo"
"I mean Luka had no trouble feeding Boban and getting the big fella paint touches. Dwight Powell is also fed a steady diet of lobs because he sets hard screens &amp; rolls hard to the rim every time.  Porzingis is awful at sealing his man off (also a reason why his rebounding is ass), he gets knocked off his spots too easily and can't establish good position down low. He also sets screens half-heartedly which is a problem as the Mavericks are heavily reliant on screens to set up Luka Doncic's attacks via switches."
"You know he is bad when someone like Dwight Powell works better at finding shots than him and someone like Boban knows more how to play in paint than him.   If Powell can benefit a lot from Luka's passes, why can't he? Because dude lacks fundamentals to do so."
"This is 100%. It's an effort thing. You seen Dwight Powell, DFS and etc showing their heart and hustle and eventually Luka trusts you to give you the ball. KP just stands around on the perimeter. Doesn't post up a mismatch. Doesn't seal his man like ayton when he was a 5. Just all around there's no role for him if he can't do much of anything reliable esp in the playoffs."
"True, you really can't judge these things as they go. In hindsight, though, it made some really shitty circumstances to the team. Nobody really thought KP would fall off the cliff like that. Everybody thought this team needed defense, grit. Obviously the trade pieces they got to alleviate that deficiency didn't work. James Johnson got traded mid-season, KP lost his blocking ability, Richardson is trash outside of that good season in Miami.   Nobody thought Luka would leap up and become a good defender. DFS became an Iguodala-type swiss army knife. Dwight Powell stopped being a turnstile.   But that trade definitely reduced their offense terribly. At the time when Dallas needed any offense, they couldn't buy a shot to save their lives. Surely a 45% 3 point shooting guard named Curry who just shot 21 and 30 his last two games would've helped that team. We know Tim Hardaway jr couldn't handle 2nd option night in and night out, why not just run it the same as last year and have them share wing duties?   In theory, that trade would've worked. A defensive minded play-making guard might've worked well with Luka. But, in my opinion, recreating those Lebron-led teams would've been the way to go. Give Luka 2 reliable shooting wings, a defensive minded power forward, a sturdy center that wouldn't have problems posting up the likes of Reggie Jackson, and this team would've gone farther than Game 7 of the first round.   But I digress.  I just hope management has something in line to help Luka get out of this first round hump. Mike needed a couple of years getting out of Detroit and Boston's shadows. Luka probably needs one more getting out of Clip's. It's a generational player's rite of passage."
"I feel like that's harsh.   We all thought Dallas fleeced the Knicks for KP, and Tim Hardaway Jr. was thrown in as cap filler and proved to be a super helpful player. Also Finney-Smith and Kleber may not be playmakers, but are both helpful role players on team-friendly deals. Brunson was a 2nd round pick. Dwight Powell had great P&amp;R chemistry with Luka before tearing his achilles.   And yeah, you can't gloss over how great of a trade the Luka trade was.  In my view this pretty much comes down to KP being injury prone and not gelling with Luka. The Seth Curry trade was also a miss, but if anything aimed to satisfy their need of that 2nd ball handler and not just be Luka, KP + shooting.  But that's still an insanely productive last 3 years transitioning out of the Dirk era, especially when compared to a team like the Spurs post Duncan."
Shoutout Dwight Powell he was ALWAYS in the gym at IMG. Also used to have some killer braids
"People forget that Dwight Powell exists. He's still coming back from an injury, but he's started to look better in the last months. If he gets back to his old form, he's a great PnR/lob partner."
"Yup. DoDo and Boban showed up. I know THJ is streaky, but if he got hot today Mavs could've won it. A pre-Achilles Dwight Powell could've been huge for them too."
"You’re right, that’s Powell I’m thinking of. RIP Dwight Powell’s athleticism, too, while we’re at it. KP is really smart and used to know what to do, so I honestly just think he’s so sapped athletically that it can look like he’s lost out there. It’s pretty fucking sad."
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
"&gt;	Also all your points are wrong, Luka is usually surrounded by 4 shooters and when he was healthy Dwight Powell was a great cutter  /u/YungJester17 just talking out his ass for quick karma"
"Kawhi plays Lebron straight up, Ibaka / Siakam take turns on AD with help from whoever is covering the Lakers’ worst shooter, Dwight gets bodied by Gasol, Lowry / FVV / Powell / Siakam nuke their individual matchups on the perimeter, Danny Green simply eats himself. Raps in 6.  Man to think of it that Raptors team was truly loaded even though it wasn’t perceived that way at the time. No idea how the Warriors with no KD and half a Klay took them to 6."
"I think the backup Point Guard role is something far more replaceable for our team. Rick Carlisle has generally been the 6'1 guard whisperer throughout his time here. Meanwhile, DFS is our only wing and Dwight Powell is by far the most hustle on our team and is the only smart rim rolling center we have.   I also feel like Brunson's value is high in a way where it could be very beneficial to include him in a trade. One possibility would be to move Brunson in a trade and then maybe be able to sign Derrick Rose (I feel like he's in the stage of his career where he isnt looking to just chase the bag but find a good fit on a competitive team)"
Could Dwight Powell have done more than Boban? I was surprised Dwight was so productive in Game 5 and never got the type of action like Boban the rest of the way. He was more athletics and seemed to find a good fit in the offense with Luka. I think that was a missed opportunity to not try to go with that adjustment.
"Disagree with point 2. The Mavs were full of shooters and had guys who could catch lobs. Hardaway, Kleber, Brunson, Redick and Finney Smith all shot really well from 3 this season and in the playoffs (Redick excluded). I recall Dwight Powell being solid at catching lobs last I checked. They have the tools. I felt they needed an additional ball handler to take the load off of Luka. Dude dropped 29 in the first half and the team as a whole had nothing to show for it. Kawhi relied on PG, Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann today when they needed it most and dropped a great game himself. Nobody on the Mavs lineup was able to fill those shoes"
We had a pretty decent Capela lite in Dwight Powell. But then he went and tore his achilles :/
I would’ve loved to see Dwight Powell get more minutes. Does anyone know why he didn’t play much?
&gt; The Mavericks outscored the Clippers by 7 points with Luka Doncic on the floor in this series.  Is that really an impressive amount? DFS outscored the Mavericks by 26 points and Dwight Powell by 10 points. On the flipside Reggie Jackson outscored the Mavs by 50 points. Damian Lillard was plus +27 in his losing performance.
"I don't watch a ton of Mavs games, but I feel like a lot of your supporting players are good. I think the only issue is that Porzingis is shit and can't be the second star. Hardaway, Dorian Finney-Smith, Brunson, Josh Richardson, Dwight Powell, and Boban all impressed me this series. Especially DFS. That's 7 quality players. Even Kleber is a pretty solid player."
Boban handling the ball. Dwight Powell taking the 3s
"So many things open up for his game if he has a true roll / lob threat. Dwight Powell is a fine option off the bench I guess, but absolutely cannot be his only target. Richaun Holmes or bust"
"Bruh the man's 22 lmao they still got time  Also all your points are wrong, Luka is usually surrounded by 4 shooters and when he was healthy Dwight Powell was a great cutter"
"less Boban, more Dwight Powell, More Kleiber."
Dwight Powell how do you get bodied by Terrance Mann
Dwight Powell is painful to watch.
Dwight Powell is better than boban
Dwight Powell will be the X factor today. His hustle and energy is so important
Dwight Powell is eating the glass.
The Dwight Powell pump fake.
The Dwight Powell pump fake.
Glad to see Dwight Powell early instead of WCS
Partially because we have such few players who can be trusted to dribble or pass the ball. We have bit more of a motion offense when Dwight Powell is on the floor because he’s better at passing from the roller/center position
WCS: -13 Dwight Powell: +3
WCS: 18 Mins Dwight Powell: 6 Mins
So Dwight Powell basically wins us game 5 and is getting benched for WCS? I love Rick man but I swear he overthinks himself sometimes.
Bro that's our entire team unless you consider Dwight Powell a big
DWIGHT POWELL REDEMPTION ARC CONTINUES MAYBE????
Ughhhhh this bench unit for us has not looked good LOVE the Dwight Powell sub
Where is Dwight Powell? Why is WCS in this game
I really don’t get why Rick thinks WCS is better than Dwight Powell
Damn if Dwight Powell had never suffered that Achilles injury...
An under discussed adjustment that isn’t talked about more is the more Dwight Powell minutes
Dwight Powell is hot as fuck
i hope he gets some early fouls so we see more of Dwight powell
That is only our offensive scheme when KP is on the floor. We thrive with Dwight Powell there and he is a rim roller. WCS is a rim roller. Luka plays significant PnR. Capela would fit perfectly
&gt; The Kawhi/PG led Clippers are going to lose to Luka and guys in the witness protection program.  The disrespect for Dwight Powell.
How is Nurkic in the pick and roll? We desperately need a rim runner who is better than Dwight Powell.
"he’s another scorer with no defense, and I think i’ll take KP here considering our other centers are boban and dwight powell, two even worse defenders"
"I mean... he's not wrong, but can't you basically do this with almost any class? Example...  2014 class - Embiid, Randle, Jokic, Nurkic, Harris, Gordon, Smart, Capela, Bogdan, Slow Mo, Clarkson, Saric, Parker... even Elfrid and Dwight Powell.  No signs of Stauskas though"
Dwight Powell over Smart and Gordon is kinda surprising tbh
Dwight Powell over Smart and Gordon is kinda surprising tbh
"&gt; but Centers just aren't that valuable   Yes they are.  &gt; You can get a guy who gives you 70% of Aytons production on both ends, for like $10m.  No, you really cannot.  $15M gets you Cody Zeller and a 10/7.  $11M buys you Dwight Powell and a nightly 8/5.  Ayton is giving the Suns an 18/12 *in the playoffs*, and he's still only 22 years old and improving.  Capela would get better than 5/$90M if he hit the market today."
"I really like seeing dwight powell use his athleticism. He's been a turnstile on defense in the past but he was brilliant last night. He's such a stark contrast to so many slow, low-response big guys in the league."
canadian legend dwight powell
They have to play Dwight Powell more in that series.  His effort on the offensive glass was great to watch.  Especially when hardaway missed a 3 he comes flying in and get the board and kicks it right back to him and THJ bangs the 3.  He brings energy and can still pick and roll with Luka.
Dwight Powell doesnt fumble the ball on catches like other bigs on PicknRolls.
"To keep Kawhi and PG the heck out of the paint where they’ve been killing us and to force their role players to jack up threes. Still not ideal obviously with how they shoot the 3, but not much else we can do.   I think Dwight Powell was really a game changer for us as well, I expect him to play a lot more the rest of the series"
"I know Lukas gonna get a lot of credit, but Dwight Powell coming back really made an impact and might be enough to help Dallas make it through"
You morons! You lost to Dwight Powell!
Seems like THJ and Dwight Powell are the only Mavs who know how to play off ball
Dwight Powell what on earth are you doing
put Dwight Powell back in
"Dwight Powell has played a pivotal role on defense. Honestly seems like the 2nd most valuable player for the mavs this game. Porzingis is literally invisible, they should try running the Luka PnR with him for some pick and pop action"
I think we should turn this series into a TMann and Kawhi vs Luka and Dwight Powell 2v2
Dwight Powell has made some damn good plays tonight.
Dwight Powell gonna start next game
Dwight Powell Toronto mans ⚡️
Dwight Powell has been the difference today
Dwight Powell a +17 in the 3rd
You could ask Dwight Powell to do literally anything and the man would put every ounce of energy into it
Switching Boban out for Dwight Powell lets Porzingis defend Zubac and pack the paint.
Dwight Powell shifted momentum with his energy
Luka obviously carrying us but can we give Dwight Powell some recognition? He's brought tons of energy and has been a great pick and roll partner for Luka which has helped Luka dominate the way he has.
Dwight Powell is so important to Mavs.
"New to watching the Mavs - Dwight Powell seems like an awesome run-the-floor, athletic big that works his ass off on the boards. What's the perception on him? Am I catching him on a good night?"
Dwight Powell is our second best big man right now. FFS.
Dwight Powell should be getting more play time. One of the few Mavs players that seems to have any life
dwight powell changed everything
Dwight Powell just found the keys to the Matrix.
Kawhi is driving and kicking the ball out. Mavs had it scouted and were able to collapse in on kawhi. Dwight Powell is out hustling everyone for boards atm too
I love Dwight. My pregame request was zone defense and Dwight Powell. I can be happy with any results now
Dwight Powell has been a big difference maker these last few minutes
"Dwight Powell got the energy the Mavs need rn, he’s a dog"
"See, this is the Dwight Powell I remember before his Achilles, him and Luka on the floor together always seemed deadly, but I missed a lot of the games he played earlier in the season."
Dwight powell breathing life into this offence my god
I will always love Dwight Powell.
DWIGHT POWELL BRINGS SO MUCH TO THE TEAM
"Well yea. Harden got a team playing sophomore Beverly, Terrence Jones, omer Asik, Francisco Garcia, josh Powell and Donatas Motiejūnas serious minutes to 54 wins and the 2nd seed.   We can argue about Dray vs Dwight that year but don’t act like harden hasn’t had a history of getting bad players to a ton of wins."
dwight powell since he's now single
"Probably the same way that this happened:  In 2017-18, of all 5-man lineups that played at least 200 minutes, the best *defensive* lineup in the league was JJ Barea/Yogi Ferrell/Devin Harris/Dwight Powell/Dirk Nowitzki."
"This seems like a bad idea. Like OP said don't you want to convince Luka he can win now? Two straight seasons of first round exits. After turning their FO upside down it would be a horrible idea to tell Luka ""oh btw not only did we not hire the assistant that you liked but we're gonna mail-in next season until Kawhi gets healthy, so enjoy running it back with the same team minus Hardaway Jr., Dwight Powell, and Trey Burke"""
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker…. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
Dillon Brooks and Dwight Powell too.  Sad we didnt get to see Team Canada at full strength for the Olympic qualies
"I think it also really hurt us that we had only 1 real big but having more roster continuity would goa long way. 2 TT, Birch, Boucher or Olynyk being available would have changed things significantly when we gave up size almost every game with Dwight Powell and Trey Lyles as our bigs"
You’ll get Dwight Powell and like it
"Why are you getting downvoted for this? I don't think they fair well if you're marching out THJ, J. Brun, WCS, Josh Richardson, and DFS against these other countries' finest.   Luka is playing for Slovenia. KP: Latvian; Boban: Serbian; Dwight Powell: Canadian; Kleber: German. That's avg. 63 points nightly, not to mention defensive contribution and rebounding ability."
Are you forgetting the legend known as Dwight Powell?
"Bro I mean a roster of Jamal, SGA, Wiggins, Barrett, Dort, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Olynyk, Dwight Powell, Chris Boucher and Cory Joseph is pretty ridiculously good, they have a lot of exciting younger guys too...Alexander-Walker comes to mind. A fully healthy Canadian B-ball Olympic team has gotta be the second best team in the world by a long shot, right?"
I still can't believe Dwight Powell makes 12mil yearly for the scrub he is.
Dwight Powell
Rondo was a throw in in the Dwight Powell trade. That's how I remember it.
We traded him and Brandan Wright to the celtics in the rondo trade. We got Dwight Powell out of it too so it wasn't an absolute loss.  I remember being really disappointed we got rid of crowder tho.
"If he plays like he did in the Slovenia game (which is my limited experience with watching him), he's a downgrade from Dwight Powell."
"I wish I could sticky this to every Mavs thread. The only assets we have from the 2014-2018 era are Maxi and Dorian Finney-Smith (Dwight Powell is a negative asset), players who would probably play on the bench for any contending team.   Getting Luka in 2018 was absolutely incredible for Mavs fans, but it expedited our rebuild way too early and our FO was too incompetent to manage it."
"should watch the highlights of us playing the Czechs yesterday  outrebounded because we had a small team with Dwight Powell as our #1 option at C, and we completely lost our shooting touch by shooting 24% from 3.  yes, you read that right.  a team of NBA talent shot 24% from a shorter FIBA 3-pt line.    the problem with Canada Basketball is they try to go for the USA Basketball strategy where they throw together a bunch of dudes a few weeks before a big tournament and hope everything goes well, but we don't nearly have as much talent as the Americans to get away with doing anything of that sort.  I hope this is truly a wakeup call for Glen Grunwald and Rowan Barrett, but I really doubt anything is going to change if things didn't change after we failed to qualify for Rio.  it's always the same fucking platitudes from Canada Basketball: the future is bright, we'll get 'em next Olympics cycle, etc etc.  same ""there's hope"" bullshit.  well, results don't lie and we haven't made the Olympics since 2000 in the Nash days."
"So 37 years old dude and a big from Japanese B league muscled the team full of NBA talent.  And the same Czech team finished above NBA stacked USA team at the last world championships.  Just goes to show that some of those NBA players are completely useless. Dwight Powell, lol, just ship him somewhere in Japan to play in the minor league."
"Also this Canada team was really unbalanced. Their 4 best players are 2(3) SGs and a small forward. They have no centre so we're crushed on the glass 52-39. They also have no good PG to get easy looks for others. NAW is a good scoring guard (probably their 4th best player at the minute but he isn't a PG). Missing both Murray and Shai killed this team.  Shai, Dort, Barrett, Wiggins, and then Olynyk or maybe even TT is a really damn good team even in the nba is definitely a playoff team in the east. But in probably the 2 most important positions to have competent players in Canada had Corey Joseph and Dwight Powell."
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).  Clippers: Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, Ibaka, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Zubac, Pistons Kennard, Mavericks Yogi Ferrell.  Lakers: LeBron, Pelicans AD, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Harrell, Wesley Matthews, Schroder, Kuzma, Suns Markieff Morris, Pistons KCP, Suns Jared Dudley, Kings Ben McLemore.  76ers: Prime Dwight, Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, Spurs Danny Green, Pacers George Hill, Milton, Warriors Anthony Tolliver.  Suns: Prime CP3, Booker, Ayton, Crowder, Bridges, 76ers Saric, Hornets Kaminsky, Pelicans E'Twaun Moore.  Warriors: Steph, Klay, Draymond, T-Wolves Wiggins, Hawks Bazemore, Wizards Kelly Oubre, Damion Lee, Paschall.

Bucks: Giannis, Lopez, Holiday, Middleton, Teague, Portis, Tucker, Forbes.  Knicks: MVP Rose, Randle, Barrett, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Nerlens Noel, Pistons Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks, Quickley."
"Yeah. It’s too bad that our best big men were injured or opted out. Kelly Olynyk, TT and Khem Birch would’ve helped a lot. We wouldn’t have had to rely on Dwight Powell so much."
"Single elimination, and no answer for their 7'1 big man. Dwight powell may be better for the nba game but isn't big or strong enough to guard post players. Not only that, Czech republic has been together for a long time, so their cohesion is just way better"
Dwight Powell is balling for Canada in the FIBA qualifier. I think he got a double-double last game.
He's significantly worse than Maxi Kiebler. I'd say injured Dwight Powell is probably better too
"Group A looks to be very tough if Canada makes it bc they have Wiggins, Dort, Barrett and Dwight Powell...not exactly Allstars but legit NBA players. France has Gobert and Fournier, Batum, Nikilina and Cabarot from GSW. Plus the US and I dont know how good Iran is, but that's two solid NBA level squads the US has to get through."
But you didn’t let him finish… we’ll throw in Maxi and Dwight Powell as well.
Dwight Powell is nice
"From my understanding, FIBA basketball is slower but more physical. Half-court offense is king.  I was watching Dwight Powell get bashed about by four huge Greek guys last night and it seemed very different from the NBA."
"Jamal Murray - SGA - Corey Joseph   Dillion Brooks - Lugentz Dort     RJ Barrett - Andrew Wiggins   Kelly Olynyk - Chris Boucher   Tristan Thompson -  Dwight Powell - Khem Birch     Barely misses cut: NAW, Nembhard, Ejim, Mulder"
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
Dwight “104.17% TS” Powell
"Cory Joseph, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell"
"CoJo, RJ, Wiggs, Trey lyles and Dwight Powell"
can't wait to see some fucking idiots fall for the Dwight Powell pump fake on a global scale
This Dwight Powell commercial kinda creeps me out ngl
Dwight Powell
7 was taken by someone on the Mavericks when Luka got there. (Dwight Powell maybe?) So he decided on 77 instead.
"Imagine if Luka had John Collins, Capela, and Bogdan instead of Tingus Pingus, Dwight Powell, and Josh Richardson"
Maybe Rick wants to bring Dwight Powell with him?
"How does this imply Trae is a better passer? What if his teammates are simply more likely to make the shot?  Even on threes i think trae assists are more valuable. A lot of luka's assists are i pass to you and you make a play. While for trae young most of the time he passes after making a play. If you look at these assists generally trae create more open, better shots for his team.  Trae has two of the biggest lob threats in the NBA.   You can't convince me that kp or dwight powell can't finish on these trae young passes, most of them or uncontested layups or dunks.  Also why are passes to the interior inherently a better indicator of passing ability?  It's way easier to create an open 3 than an uncontested lay up or dunk in the nba. How is this not obvious."
"I mean you’re wrong. Luka and Dwight Powell were one of the most efficient pnr duos in the league before his injury, and Collins would be significantly better than Powell.  KP has to sit in timeout in the corner because he won’t roll to the rim and he can’t score over Reggie Jackson"
We already have Dwight Powell and WCS for the dunker slot.    Ben doesn't fit at all.
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
"Odom was depressed and on drugs while he was here... I'm not entirely sure what else Carlisle could've done. He tried to work with him and put him in positions to succeed but at the end of the day Lamar Odom did not want to be here.   Rondo he was a hard ass with, but to Rick's credit, we were like 25-10 prior to the Rondo trade, on pace for a 58-60 win season, our best since the Championship. We trade for Rondo and he wanted full control of the offense, despite what we had already been doing being effective. We finish the year like 25-20 under Rondo and limp to a 50 win record despite the very good start. Yes Carlisle butted heads with Rondo, but Carlisle showed he was producing more wins that the Rondo led offense.   Tyson wanted to come back, so did Carlisle and Dirk, Cuban ultimately passed on Tyson twice. What was Rick supposed to do? Buy the team from Cuban and re-sign Tyson himself? They all lobbied for Tyson to stay, Rick publicly called him the best Center in Mavericks history.   Players have been vocal about not liking him, which is valid, but the three examples you provided are not great. All of them were either out of his control, or in the case of Rondo, his approach proved to lead to better wins.   Also we lost in 4 to the eventual Western Conference Champions in 4, but it was one of the closest sweeps ever. We lost 3 of the games by a combined 10 or so points. G1 was a last second buzzer beater from 3 by Durant, then the other two were like 4-5 point losses. Not to mention we had lost Tyson and our starters were 32-37 years old playing in a condensed season and fatigued a lot more than the younger Thunder. Did you watch the series or did you go to basketball reference and see we got swept and assumed Rick was a bad coach? Like I said, the series was a lot closer than the outcome suggests, look at the boxscore and play by play, super close games and we had leads in the 4th quarter in 3 of the 4 games, OKC was a great team that year. Go watch the 2014 first round series or the 2016 first round series. Rick coached circles around the 61 win Spurs and took them to 7 with Samuel Dalembert, Jose Calderon and old Dirk as his best players. 2016 we stole a game from the best team the Thunder have put together while starting fat Raymond Felton, Zaza Pachulia, 37 year old Dirk and Wes Matthews his first year back from his torn ACL. Rick has coached some pretty mediocre teams to the playoffs and made the series way more competitive than they should've been. This was largely due to stay competitive during Dirk's twilight to his career. If we had full on rebuilt Rick wouldn't have had those first round exits.   Lastly, you can fault Rick for a lot of things but not getting enough out of role players is the absolute last thing on that list. He has made so many washed up or mediocre players look great in his system. Old Raymond Felton and Mike James, Brandon Wright, Deron Williams, Brandon Bass, Dwight Powell, Justin Anderson, Dennis Smith Jr., Yogi Ferrell, Roddy Beauboius, DeShawn Stevenson, JJ Barea... All of those guys were out of the league or way worse the second they left the Mavs. Carlisle is an incredible coach at getting every inch out of role players. I'd argue his worst trait is his inability to manage star egos. He lucked out that Dirk had no ego or even Harrison Barnes, but he's struggled with players who had egos/tempers, Chandler Parsons, Luka, Salah Mejri etc...   No one is saying Rick is perfect and he's very much an old coach in a new coaches world, but do you even watch him? All of your critiques are not really true."
"Simmons fits incredibly well with Doncic lol, Simmons as the roll man would be amazing with Doncic's handle/passing/pull-up ability. Would be like if someone did genius surgery on Dwight Powell"
"&gt; I think Dallas’ current brain trust is against having big men like Adams crowding the lane   What about Dwight Powell, Willy Cauley-Stein, and Boban makes you think that  Second of all, there is no Dallas brain trust, they all got fired"
"The way teams will guard Simmons, the only difference between Simmons as the role man and Dwight Powell is Simmons can hit the open man if the defense rotates over. But that’s a lot to pay so much for. The real factor that they should consider it for is that KP is apparently pretty unhappy too, so it might make sense to trade him before he demands a trade and ranks his value too.  Gonna be interesting if either KP or Simmons get traded. The last player as good as either of them who had to rehabilitate his image as much was Jimmy Butler when people thought he was a cancer."
"Ok fine, but fact of the matter is that the Mavs were never favored in a series after we won the championship.  Can't blame a coach for that.  People who were paying attention were complimenting Carlisle the whole time for getting a lot out of weak rosters.  We took the champs to 7 in 2014 in the first round and nobody else took them to 7, for example.  We had elite bench units for multiple years centered around Barea and Dwight Powell, and most observers agree that this was due to scheme."
You can have Dwight Powell + josh Richardson
Granted Ayton isn't the best player on his team. And imagine if Luka had nearly shot himself out of game 7 against the Clippers but been carried most of the way by Jalen Brunson or Dwight Powell...
"In fairness to Trae, Luka was getting these same easy assists when Dwight Powell was our go-to lob guy before his achilles injury. Trae's floater game also opens up his lobs so it's not something I would hold against him."
"Canada has Wiggins, RJ Barrett, Cory Joseph, Dwight Powell, Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Trey Lyles, Mychal Mulder, and home court so it will be tough for Turkey to qualify, but should be a good tourney with Greece and China also having decent teams."
"Thats the risk but if he just is a better Dwight Powell then he would be pretty useful, especially since he plays good D and would be a second ballhandler."
"How? Luka needs spacing to do his thing. What is Simmons supposed to do while Luka has the ball? The only way I could see this work is with Simmons as a small ball center - and at that point, he is basically just a more expensive Dwight Powell."
"It’s good in the backcourt and on the wing, but the bigs are dicey. Like, they’d have to live with some combination of Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, and Chris Boucher. They’re not bad in an Olympic context, but compared to the US or Serbia they’ll have a tough time."
Is DP Dwight Powell?
Dwight Powell
Luka-Dorian-Brunson-Boban.   Probably can add THJ-Dwight Powell-Maxi Kleber to that mix as well.
"Not one second did I believe that Clint capela, John Collins, Lou Williams, Gallo, Huerter, Hunter, Reddish, fucking Bogdanovic  Is worse than Kleber, Brunson, THj, Josh Richardson, Dwight Powell, DFS.  Not one fucking second. Every GM would rather take the hawks core then and now, just like they would take Luka instead of Trae if they could choose right now.  Your just on a fucking mission and you fail to see how weirdly you spin your take. The mavs players are shit, their boxscores look ok because of Luka, and you then put the Luka inflated role player stats to say his team is better. Whatever  Trae is fucking lit anyway"
"Just as a halfass measure of value, Luka's VORP was 3.4, 5.4, 5.0 over his three seasons. His best teammate is 2019 Dwight Powell (2.1) and his 2nd best was 1.8 (2020 Kristaps)  Nobody else above 1.4  LeBron's rookie year, Boozer was 2.7 and Ilgauskas was 1.9  his 2nd year, Gooden was 2.3, his 3rd year Ilgauskas was 2.1.    Year 4, nobody above 1.3, year 5 nobody above 1.0, Year 6 and 7 Mo Williams was 3.1 and 2.3  So basically, neither had any really good teammates."
"I said this elsewhere, and I’ll paste it here:  As hard as it is for me to say, because I’ve always been a huge Carlisle supporter, this might be a good thing. The Mavs roster wasn’t great this year, but it wasn’t THAT bad. They made the fifth seed in the West, and they have a first team all-NBA player.  KP played the worst basketball of his career this year, and in the playoffs he was non-existent. All of our “Rick Carlisle Reclaimation Project” guys, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Dwight Powell, did NOTHING all series long. They, and especially Jaylon Brunson, looked absolutely unprepared and scared of the big moment in the playoffs. That’s on the coach, plain and simple. It’s not like the guys haven’t been in the playoffs, they all had before! If your team is unprepared, that’s on the coach.  People said KP was in the corner by design. Carlisle has doubled and tripled down on NOT using him as a post up player, or even trying. The KP we saw in the playoffs is who Carlisle wanted him to be. This team is filled with Carlisle guys and the result was the same as last year: first round exit. Yeah, KP’s game sucked this year. But again, who is that on? Coach him up! If he won’t post up, and that’s what you want him to do, sit his ass on the bench and tell him to go lift some weights after the game. You’re the coach, he’s the player.  An extra hard-to-swallow pill is this: Rick got outcoached by Ty Lue. Ty made adjustments, sat starters, went deep in his bench when he was on the ropes. He went and played Reggie Jackson big minutes because he was killing us. What did Rick do? Nothing, he just kept letting Luka play iso ball. No set plays to get his other shooters going, no getting the ball to KP down low. In absolute fact, one could argue Rick lost us the series by sitting Luka when the Mavs were up big in quarter 1 of game 3. We had to foul to get Luka back in the game because the Clippers melted a 20 point lead in like 5 minutes. That, again, is on the coach.  The Mavs were NOT great this year, but they were a solid team with plenty of useful guys that have done things elsewhere. But in the playoffs, they looked like Luka and the Washington Generals. If Rick’s plan was to out-talent the other team, then why do we need Rick? Even I can tell Luka to “go be great”.  The Mavs need a change of scenery. So thanks for 2011, I’ll always love ya Rick, but it was time for a change."

"It would take some doing by Carlisle but in time Ben could work like a supercharged Dwight Powell on offense for us, a menace in the short roll. He has all the tools for it. And the defense is obviously great. I'd definitely try this out."
Simmons would essentially replace Dwight Powell in the Mavs offense. Basically run pnr with Luka.
"He drafted him, he'll forever be a pal, but boy, everyone wants to read way too much into nothing. At the end of the day, Donnie's built a pretty poor squad around Luka that doesn't have much of a future and I would guess Luka can see that looking around the league.    You're committed to guys like Dwight Powell who isn't really playable against most playoff teams. THJ is a great player, but 20m for a streaky shooter that makes a living off tough shots who at 29 isn't going to change his game much. It goes on..  Part of it is not having the opportunity for multiple high draft picks to build a core around Luka like the Hawks or the Griz before Ja. But even those teams found gems later in the first or second like Brooks. All Donnie's got of late is Jalen Brunson."
Dwight powell
That’s what I’m saying. I don’t understand the structure of this trade if it doesn’t include someone like Russell. I see a Mavs fan suggesting Dwight Powell and Stein. I don’t even know who Stein is.   Someone make it make sense.
Wolves can get Dwight Powell and Philly gets Cauley Stein. We’ll thrown in Trey Burke for good measure.
Mavs will be your third team. Take Dwight Powell and Stein. Wolves send us Malik Beasley. Dudes a bucket.
Hard to be traded when you're making like 20M a year to be your reserve point guard.  Also where's the Mavs? A trade centered around Dwight Powell makes sense.
"If everybody is healthy and chooses to play for you guys you would be silver medal favorites imo with a chance of upsetting USA for gold.  You’ve got Murray/SGA/Brooks/Wiggins/Olynyk   Then Cory Joseph/Dort/RJ/Boucher/Birch  And that’s still leaving off some solid guys like Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell, Oshae Brisset, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker  That’s a lot of talent, and if they commit to the three year plan then they’re for sure strong contenders"
Heres my list for team canada:  Pg-Jamal Murray G-Shai Gilgeous-Alexander F-Andrew Wiggins F-RJ Barrett C-Olynyk  Pg-Corey Joseph G-Dillon Brooks F-Lugentz Dort F-Chris Boucher C-Tristan Thompson Pg-Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Other NBA talents:  C-Dwight Powell Pf-Khem Birch F-Brandon Clarke F-Oshae Brissett Sg-Mychal Mulder Sg-Joshua Primo Pf-Trey Lyles Sg-Chris Duarte Pg-Dalano Banton Sf-Ignas Brazdeikis Sg-Nate Darling Pf-Mfiondu Kabengele Sg-AJ Lawson Sf-Eugene Omoruyi  Other Talent: F-Anthony Bennett Pf-Kyle Wiltjer Pg-Tyler Ennis Sg-Nik Stauskas Sg-Marial Shayok Sg-Xavier Rathan-Mayes Pf-Andrew Nicholson Sg-Naz Mitrou-Long Pg-Karim Mané Sg-Andy Rautins C-Sim Bhullar Pf-Simisola Shittu  College and future talent: Sf-Caleb Houstan Sg-Bennedict Mathurin Sg-Elijah Fisher Pg-Ryan Nembrand C-Charles Bediako C-Zach Edey  International Canadian Players: Pg-Kevin Pangos F-Melvin Ejim G-Phillip Scrubb Sg-Brady Heslip F-Thomas Scrubb Pf-Aaron Doornekamp
We need a big man to bang with those European bigs in FIBA desperately. You could see Dwight Powell was trying hard but he is just way too small in those FIBA games.
"&gt; Mavs have won 49 games or more just twice since their championship year in 2010-11 (49 wins in 13-14 and 50 wins in 14-15). &gt;  &gt;   Don't think it's worth comparing two entirely different teams to the current one (the only player to be on either of those who's still on the Mavs now is Dwight Powell, who played garbage time only in 14-15). And last year, if you discount the games where half our rotation got COVID, we won at a 52-win pace. Though I agree that the coaching change is a big wildcard."
"Before it's dwight powell  Now if powell gone, HINTON HIVE BABY!"
Recently. For my Mavs. It's been Nate Hinton and Dwight Powell. Both guys are always so hyped
"Please take Dwight Powell, Raptors.  He’s ok a little overpaid but definitely a rotation player we have Boban, Porzingis, Brown, Kleber, WCS, all playing in the front court already so he isnt needed."
He’s an expiring so his contract really doesn’t matter. It’s actually even a benefit in some ways because the team taking him on will have to expel some bad contracts the other way (ie Dwight Powell depending on rehab)
"Because Toronto is not trying to compete. Center depth was a need just so it’s not a complete disaster but the Raps would rather go young hence also getting Precious from the Heat.   They already acquired a serviceable vet at center in Khem Birch at the deadline last year who played well and brought him back. So they already have a vet that can be a low end starter.  If Dwight Powell is included in the trade, there’s another quality vet big that can eat minutes.  And then they’ll have Precious who will have an opportunity to compete for minutes and develop as well as Brown.   And Boucher will be situational and matchup dependent as I’m sure Precious and Dwight would be.   The Raptors problem was their big rotation to start last year was Baynes and Alex Len who both sucked. Bringing in Khem Birch who was serviceable and played well basically solved their problem. Now they can have him start and play 25 minutes a night and have young guys develop behind him"
"Not only Canadian, Torontonian.  He went to a relatively known highschool around the area (Earl Haig). I still remember stories about ""Dude I sat next to Dwight Powell in class, he tall as shit, made him sit in the back""."
You can’t think of better ways to spend $11 million than a post injury Dwight Powell?
"How many points does Dwight Powell average?  WHAT?!? Just 6?  Playing with Luka, you'd think all he has to do is run the floor for easy opportunities....  FOH"
Like how the mavs last year would always start with a Dwight Powell play
I’m not sure that there’s a second Dwight powell to make the offer worse with
Honestly Mason Plumlee or Dwight Powell come to mind and they both make around 8-11M a year iirc.
"Problem is, not every team has a line of former All-Stars begging to play for them on a vet min. Lowry was off as soon as the magnificent city of Miami blessed him with the honor of living there. DeRozan was a huge overpay from the Bulls. A similar offer to us would be Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell. ""Oh, but those players are replaceable, role players, yadayada"". If you see our rotations in the Clippers series, you will see that we had to give significant minutes to Nicollo Melli, currently on a non-Euroleague team. If you see the games, you will notice how half of our possessions were wasted with Melli or a gassed DFS bricking a corner 3.  We brought defenders. We have now a rotation of wings that can switch 1-4 AND can handle their own on open shots. We could've paid DeRozan, yes, at the expense of THJ, but we could. We wouldn't, however, have any defensive depth on the wings. We would require again vet min contracts, and, unlike the almighty Los Angeles Lakers, the players that considers the vet min for us are *slightly* worse than Nunn and Monk.   Dinwiddie probably wanted to be a clear cut starting PG, considering his plan B was the Pelicans. Lonzo could've been attainable with the right price. Chicago's offer was better than the one that we could offer, but maybe we could've convinced Lonzo to force a move here. Maybe we did, but it did not work. Norman Powell signed on a steal for Portland, cheaper than THJ on production, but, again, the difference isn't that big.   Nico did what he could. He did not hinder the team going for the fences in a nutjob trade for a #2, he did not sit and waited for the Kawhi's pseudo tour while allowing every FA to walk. He took a position of deep need, signed 2 market-friendly contracts in THJ and Bullock and a steal in Sterling Brown. We still have the TPE that we can use to either add a passer (I want us to talk with the Pels for Sato) or a prolific offensive option (maybe Markkanen will accept a discount to play with Luka)."
"I think Raptors want to ship Goran somewhere else anyway but they can't find good deals yet.  Mavs want Goran but they don't want to part way with Dwight Powell, whom Raps want in order to patch up their front court."
"Sure, Dwight Powell, Trey Burke and Tyrell Terry."
"Boban, Moses Brown, Dwight Powell and Nate Hilton"
We didn’t really want him either though.  There was a rumour we were going to flip him to Dallas for Dwight Powell.  Guess that fell through
"Cuban is turning into Jerry Jones before our eyes.  Title should read ""Mavs have strong interest in acquiring Lauri Markkanen if all they have to trade is shitty overpaid negative value players like Dwight Powell and Trey Burke.""  Same as the Cowboys in free agency every year having interest in players that sign bargain basement contracts."
"I remember going to my second Raptors game, this time against the Rockets, and this guy was a monster on the glass.  He’s was like a Dwight Powell."
Trading for Rondo was…annoying. Dwight Powell has been solid for a long time but we broke up the leagues best offense ever at that point for Rondo. Who shat the bed for us and left as soon as he could.
"This is what patriot looks like!  True Patriot needs to go to real Patriot State, Texas!  We can send immigrants like Dwight Powell and Tingis Pingis to city of Portland!"
Raptors were the ones that were asking for too much. I would have gladly sent them Dwight Powell and Willey Cauley-Stein.
The Mavs have 15 million worth in contracts unless they’re in the mood to keep Dwight Powell and their rookie guards that will probably barely play.
Lmao damn straight. When we say we want Canadians to come back home we obviously meant Dwight Powell not Shai or Jamal Murray
But the Canadian team has to take Dwight Powell.  Don't you want a backup center for a starting point guard?
"Lmao of course the Mavs fan is coming in, this happens every year, it won’t be hard for them to move on from Dragic, besides anything is better than Dwight Powell and taking on his multi year contract"
Yeah for Dwight Powell and Burke. They’re not parting with their young assets.
"\[Woj\] Dragic trade talks are stalled with the Mavs because the Raptors refuse to take back Dwight Powell, who is 6'10."
"I will always believe that if Khem Birch (or Tristan Thompson) were on Canada's team this summer, we would've qualified for the Olympics.  Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles and Andrew Nicholson are fine players, but none of them are know for their defence.  We were abused down low in all of the games.  A tough, physical post defender would've changed everything."
"SGA, RJ Barrett, Jamal Murray, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk. Thats a playoff team. Name 5 countries that can match that talent output. The only thing holding this team back is injuries. Don't be surprised when Canada becomes a legitimate medal threat."
Raptors arent taking on Dwight Powell’s contract and WCS for Dragic straight up. One of Terry or Green need to be included. Dragic is better than Powell and WCS combined.
Dallas maybe? Isn't Dwight Powell out with injury
Dwight Powell is much better
Mike Tobey is just Dwight Powell but much worse
"He's an athletic rim-runner, if Bagley still can't play alongside a generational playmaker like Luka I ain't got much hope left for him lmao  I mean ffs Dwight Powell thrived next to Luka just setting hard screens and rolling to the basket for lobs."
Don't disrespect Dwight Powell like that.
May I interest you in one Dwight Powell and Trey Burke?
Bawh Gawd that's a Dwight Powell sized exception!
"They dont need to send back anything amazing, Luke Kennard and a 2nd would likely be enough.  They key is not taking back a bad contract for free like Dwight Powell."
"Seriously? The hold up is fucking Dwight Powell? No offense, he’s done a lot for the community but he’s just not a good basketball player at the salary he’s at… idk why Mavs have such a hard on for this dude…"
I want Dwight Powell or Maxi
Maybe he thought it was Dwight Powell lol
"1 Dwight Powell, coming right up."
Mavs are balking at sending WCStein and Dwight Powell though. This whole thing could fall apart.
Dallas isn’t giving up Josh Green for Dragic. Dwight Powell and Burke is the likely return. Or Toronto can just keep him.
Brunson/Dwight Powell/WCS. literally anyone except Luka/KP/THJ
"Basketball reference has him tied for 6th behind Dwight/WCS/Grant Williams/Favors/Powell, wonder where the discrepancy is there."
"Hes 53rd if you don’t put a minimum minutes requirement.  If you limit it to players who played more than 500 minutes this past season he’s 14th.    The players ahead of him include Isaiah Hartenstein, Javale, Goga, Dwight, Okongwu, Boogie, Mo Wagner, Wiseman, Cauley-Stein, Damian Jones, Grant Williams, Derrick Favors, and Dwight Powell."
I don’t love this list. I’d prob toss Dwight Powell in as a C. Maybe Josh Hart or Mills as guards.

"that's actually what this is all about, not this dwight powell is beloved thing  dallas taking on dragic's salary is the asset, no way they're sending powell and wcs. sure they're not amazing players but people don't understand they're still important pieces on our team because the kp situation isn't clear"
Lauri for Dwight Powell lol
"I assume all these tweets are just posturing. The Dwight/Luka pick and roll is fantastic, but Powell is overpaid and doesn’t have a huge role.  He works his ass of tho. Good culture guy.   WCS seems cool, but he can drop lobs and miss dunks elsewhere."
"Imagine not getting Dragic over Dwight ""The worse"" Powell"
"Dragic for dwight powell, i guess we save some money. I’d ask for something like two seconds with that too tho or moses brown he’s definitely intriguing."
It’s also because the Mavericks were trying to sign a point guard/ball handler and struck out in free agency.   Realistically what guards outside of Dragic would Dwight Powell get in return?
Dragic for Canada native Dwight Powell???
"Dragic confirmed contract filler. Being tossed around from miami to Toronto now to Dallas as a friendly retirement deal for *Dwight Powell*. Like I said, bare minimum value. Clown."
Come on raps you know you want your prodigal son Dwight Powell.
"Spurs. We have just the guy for you. A great veteran, locker room guy. An experience tank commander. Dwight Powell. All for the low low price of sign and trading us DeMar DeRozen. How could you say no?"
I don't mind the Dwight Powell pickup we currently don't have a centre signed other than Baynes I guess.
"Ya. you would rather have great locker room guy and tank commander, Dwight Powell. Right....right?"
"Probably Powell and Burke.. love Dwight, and think he gives more to the team than fans him him credit. But that deal is probably worth it.  Could also just wait a year and avoid paying 19MM"
"Depends what Mavs want.  They want raps to either 1) buyout Goran 2) take on dwight Powell contract, who ruptured his Achilles  It's a bad look for toronto if they do either"
Who do the Mavericks have who is a similar player? The ghost of Dwight Powell? We can’t afford Collins anyway though unless Nico pulls off some fuckery.
"case could be, toronto knows dragic wanna play somewhere else. Dwight Powell is Canadian. Mavs throw 2nd round picks, boom  obviously, that's my ideal scenario"
"For that to happen you will be getting Canada’s own, Dwight Powell, and trey Burke"
"For that to happen you will be getting Canada’s own, Dwight Powell, and trey Burke"
"For that to happen you will be getting Canada’s own, Dwight Powell, and trey Burke"
Dwight powell is all you need :)
I hope so too cause the Raps could really use Dwight Powell.
"Which will be ending as Luka’s contract kicks in!   I imagine it’s happening at this point anyways though, as long as the Raptors are ok with taking Dwight Powell. Moving him and Burke is the only way we could do it now."
"Toronto is hurting for big men, Dwight Powell is right there on the crowded Mavs rotation, you see where I'm going"
Take Dwight Powell please. he is from there
Dwight Powell  it seems like a forgone conclusion at this stagw
Best we can really get is Dwight Powell but he’s signed for another 11M next year
Does it matter? Can’t be worse than Dwight Powell out there. At least they’re taller
Raptors can still get the super dynamic Canadian Super Star Dwight Powell!!!
"When he makes the other team fall for the Dwight Powell Pump Fake, you'll understand."
&gt; I'd take Dwight powell though  This person does NOT speak for all Raptors fans.
How about we take Dwight Powell
Don't think Masai cares what he wants lol. I'd take Dwight powell though
You’re gonna get number 1 Canadian Dwight Powell and be happy
I literally just ran into Dwight Powell in Toronto today lol
Talks that its to Dallas for Dwight Powell.
trade Dwight Powell or Maxi and use part of our J-Rich trade exception?
fosters a culture of sexual harassment and abuse for 20 years: i sleep  keeps dwight powell: SELL THE TEAM
Who tf is this Afseth guy?   Only way this makes sense is if Dallas sends back Dwight Powell + Trae Burke or something. Definitely nothing of value.
"I was a little kid watching the Mavs in the early 2000s and I still almost say Josh Powell half the time when talking about Dwight. Him, DJ Mbenga, and Rawle Marshall are all just ingrained in my head for no good reason"
Dwight Powell
Josh Powell is an incredible player. 50% 3 point shooter and elite defender. I would definitely trade Dwight Powell though.
Assets? We would send Dwight Powell and Trey Burke (or WCS) the other way. I wouldn’t call that “assets”.
Dwight powell
"DAE Lebron for Tim hardaway jr, Dwight Powell and Maxi??"
This man is making around the same as Dwight Powell. Why didn’t we do anything and go after him mannnnn. I wanted him so bad.
"So I was looking into this a few weeks ago myself, and it turns out there are still two untied threads that started with the trade, at least on the Celtics' side.   In November of 2020, the Celtics were part of a three team trade with the blazers and grizzlies that sent Desmond bane to Memphis and enes Kanter to Portland, giving the Celtics two second round picks, one in 2023 and one in 2025. These are the last two threads. The Cs were only able to make this trade due to getting the rights to draft Desmond Bane in 2019 through a trade that sent Ty Jerome (and Aron Baynes) to the Suns. Ty Jerome (or at least his eventual draft rights, some of the available info is hard to track) was only able to be traded to the Suns due to the Celtics trading away the draft rights to Matisse Thybulle. They only had Thybulle's draft rights due to a trade with the grizzlies that sent Deyonta Davis and Rade Zagorac to Memphis. Zagorac came to the Celtics through the trading away of Brandon Wright, who came to the Celtics from the Mavericks in the Rondo (and Dwight Powell) deal, while Davis came to the Celtics via the trading away of MarShon Brooks and Celtics legend Jordan Crawford. And to finally tie this all up, Brooks was only on the Celtics because of the initial Pierce and KG trade.  The 2023 and 2025 picks are both second rounders, but it will be very interesting to see how the rest of the rippling effect plays out"
"I’ve heard on Reddit several times that Powell’s contract is only partially guaranteed, but [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/dallas-mavericks/dwight-powell-15397/) says it’s fully guaranteed and I can’t find a source saying otherwise.   I’d also like EG on the team, though I haven’t seen him play in a couple years so I don’t know if he still has it either"
"You just listed Dwight Powell as a ""really good player"". Nothing else needs to be said."
"A good offer. Here's my counter: Dwight Powell, Moses, 5 freely chosen Shark Tank cameos, a Luka ""thank you"" hand-written note and any amount of wanted Dogecoin for every player, staff and board.  I'll have my guy call yours later today."
It was a joke man lol. But if you guys are thirsting this much for Dragic it’s gonna take more than Dwight Powell and filler to get him. That’s why no deal got done and probably won’t.
Dwight Powell is a god.
Dwight Powell is/was an elite rim roller with zero shooting. he is however elite ar setting screens and he (used to be .. and hopefully soon again) super athletic.
By god that's Dwight Powell??
Probably a lot of Dwight Powell fans out there lol looks like you got hit with downvotes too
"So, the only place I’ve seen it is a Zach Lowe article (and god, this took longer to find because of ESPN’s bizarre lack of archives), [but it’s the first video under #7](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28482160/ten-nba-things-like-including-luka-doncic-dwight-powell-dance) Although it’s probably under a pay wall, so I’m not sure what else."
Toronto- “Please take Dwight Powell in a 3 team trade so we don’t have to pay him 22mill to be a 3rd string big”   Literally every other team- “No.”
"Dwight powell, if he has 10lbs and 3' inches wingspan more. Guy H U S T L E D"
"PG - Luka SG - THJ SF - Reggie Bullock PF - DFS C- KP  Bench:  Guards: Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke  Wings: Sterling Brown, Josh Green  Bigs: Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Boban, Moses Brown"
They can get Mavs young players but they have to pick up Dwight Powell contract which goes into next yr....they better off buying him out if Goran willing to give up some money
Best I can do is Dwight Powell and trey Burke
"I, for one, think that an adequate punishment for him is to send him to Dallas. On a unrelated note, Dwight Powell is aching for a homecoming."
Man Dwight Powell has been on the same team since I was in 7th grade. I can't imagine doing the same thing for 6 straight years.
"The Mavs have consistently gotten quality production out of frankly, some kinda random players. Like no hate on Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber, and Dwight Powell, but they are not the most talented dudes in the league. Despite that, they have played key roles for the team. IMO that's one of the biggest signs of a quality coach, getting the most out of every player.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the Mavs roster outside of Luka look way more dysfunctional this year compared to previous seasons despite very little change in its makeup."
Best I can give you is Dwight Powell.
"I’d say Dwight Powell could be an option, but unsure what the Mavs would want. They need a secondary ball handler that can score a bit. Maybe a 3rd team can get involved"
"Can't I tempt you with an irresistible offer of Josh Green, Dwight Powell and Willie Cauley-Stein?   Think about all of the *hustle*."
The day we find whatever blackmail Dwight Powell has on Mark Cuban will be glorious
"I cry every time I have to think about my Mavericks extending Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, then trading away Seth."
"Idk dude. I love trae young. But I think you’re overlooking how fucking stacked that roster is. Cappella is way better than Dwight Powell. Bogdonovic is way better than Hardaway Jr. John Collins is probably better than Porzingis at this point. Huerter, Hunter, Reddish feels way more reliable and useful than finney-smith, Brunson, and Bullock.  Luka’s on/off last year are similar. With him on the floor, the Mavericks had an offensive rating of 118.5, the best offense in the league ahead of Utah’s 118.4 last year (and one of the all time greatest). Off the floor the Mavericks slipped to bottom 5 (~110.1).  Given his size and ability to post up, I just trust him a little more than trae to carry a team over the finish line in the last 2 minutes of crazy intense playoff games. Love em both. I just naturally have to give the edge to the guy who’s size let’s him play and win in a myriad of ways."
Idk how true this is but Dwight Powell is a name that speaks to me
Here's the list from 2019-2020. A lot of the same guys show up on both.   Ante Žižić  Cody Zeller   Moritz Wagner  Nikola Vučević  Noah Vonleh     Omari Spellman    Dwight Powell        Kelly Olynyk         Nicolò Melli       Kevon Looney      Frank Kaminsky    Nikola Jokić      Willy Hernangómez  Dewan Hernandez       Harry Giles     Cristiano Felício      Andre Drummond    Ed Davis            Marques Bolden  Jonah Bolden         Ryan Anderson
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."
I think maybe we go after him ngl. We’ll give you one Dwight Powell and one Josh Green.
"One guy played 30mins last year, guarding best perimeter player on daily basis, shooting 40% from 3 at enough volumes, on top 5 defensive team  One guy is dwight powell  Coach always talk about defense  Shit :("
There's no way OG is 6'7. It looks like he's much bigger than Dwight Powell and Maxi Kleber.
dwight Powell is going to have a few bruises from this game
Dwight powell out there running laps and getting abused on defense
JC and Capela are extremely talented bigs. Is Luka supposed to make Willey Cauley Stein and Dwight Powell look like top 10 bigs?
Dwight Powell is already 30?!
"Watching all the laker fans react to KP's defensive effort would be incredible  he was just standing in no mans land last game watching dwight powell get mauled by clint capela and john collins.  yeah OK you don't wanna abandon your man in the corner.. fine.. but even if they passed it out to the corner 3 shooter there's no way you are going to cover the distance in time to contest the shot anyway, you might as well try and help prevent poor dwight powell from getting annihilated"
Russ + Dwight + Nunn for Tingus + Powell + French Prince  Do it rob and mark!
"If you dont want him, throw it to us, plus dwight if you dont want fuck up chemistry. + Nunn for make it even  We send back Tingus Pingus + Dwight ""culture hustle guy"" Powell"
Tingus Pingus + Powell for Russ + Dwight + Nunn  do it you coward  *run*
"wasn't just coaching either, that roster isn't particularly good outside of luka and you're just running it back over and over  literally the same starting 5 for the third straight year, dwight powell is not a starting caliber player anymore post-injury.  DFS should be coming off the bench  mavs talk themselves into bringing in frankie ntilikina because he plays OK defense, but then you run into a josh green 2.0 situation where you can never even play him meaningful minutes because you're playing 4v5 offense or even 3v5 if its powell+ntilikina  same issues as last year that get glossed over because luka is phenomenal and carries you a lot of the time, but then when the playoffs come he can't do it by himself"
"No disrespect intended because DeAndre Hunter did defend really well but ""absolute clamps"" is a stretch. no?     First clip is help defense with Luka trying to draw a foul on a reach, with the second shot of this clip Luka being wide open and just missing.      Second clip is a great pass with Dwight Powell having stone hands.     3rd clip is great D.     4th clip DeAndre literally grabs Luka's entire arm/elbow which is why the ball goes loose, missed call.     5th is good D, makeable shot for Luka but one of those ""good d, better offense"" moments if it goes in.     6th I don't even really know what this is, DeAndre does well staying in front but Luka starts with his back facing the basket, it's not really a drive he's looking to make a pass to a cutter who ends up not being open.     7 Luka blows right by him, Hunter just has help D in the paint. With old rules (which I don't like) Luka draws a foul here, he opts to pass out instead, and it resets with Luka giving THJ a open look that he happens to miss.     8 LUka gets by him and just throws a bad lob pass.     9 Good shot by Luka that he misses     stopped watching here because I'm sure the theme is the same, it's good D overall but the majority of these clips are simply Luka messing up, missing a shot he normally makes, or his teammate missing a shot they normally make. It doesn't actually matter, I just see so many clips that are pseudo misleading and I happened to comment on this one. Example is ""X posterities Y!!"" when the person that got ""dunked on"" was barely in the area."
"I know in general nobody should be panicking after one game, but I think in this case the mavs should be panicking  yeah the hawks are good, but they looked totally outclassed as a team  they have the same roster as last year basically.  their big acquisitions were spot-shooter reggie bullock and frank ntilikina who is not a NBA caliber player.   they already have THJ to fill the spot shooter role so why go for bullock  dwight powell is not a NBA starting caliber player anymore and yet they don't have anyone else to start over him.   he gives them almost nothing on either end of the floor.  dorian finney smith is a total crapshoot from night to night what you will get.     KP is actually one of their least concerns because while he's a fundamentally flawed player at least he and luka have really nice PNR chemistry which will probably be their main scoring engine this season  they are not moving in the right direction and they probably don't have any chance to win the championship with this roster.  they don't have enough assets to get a game-changing wing player that they need to replace powell  they have the same issues as last year except with worse coaching, what are their options to improve as a team?   at least the cowboys are good I guess"
"It has more to do with us posting up DFS, letting him take longs 2s instead of 3s. letting WCS shoot long 2 pointers, eliminating dribble hand offs, taking the ball out of Luka's hand, terrible decision making in transition. Oh and starting Dwight Powell with KP, then not choosing to run pick and rolls, completely clogging the paint so nobody can drive and are forced to shoot contested 3s or rushed mid rangers.  I don't even know why I care about this team. Cuban is a garbage ass owner who lucked into 2 generational talents, which makes it look like he's atleast average."
"like I'd much rather the mavs win the west than the lakers or warriors again  just some big obvious issues which look to be the same issues from last season.  dwight powell not really contributing anything useful, lack of cohesive interior defense, nobody else can really ball handle except luka, weak bench though brunson had a good game  KP was bad, luka was mediocre, but the hawks just outclassed the team from top to bottom and sadly got out-coached I would say.   mavs need a better defensive philosophy, hopefully kidd gets it sorted out or they move on from him quickly"
Don’t know what the mavs are thinking keeping the exact same fucking team the last 3 years. They are screwing over Luka giving him Dwight Powell and finney smith wtf is that
"this is embarassing lol, dwight powell 3? DFS post up? This is straight up cursed"
Front office really thought Reggie was the key…. What an inept front office… the fact that Dwight Powell is starting is embarrassing
"""Career 29% from downtown"" Yeah ok its time to put a bullet in the Dwight Powell three pointer experiment"
Dwight Powell showcasing his only notable NBA skill lol
"i can see tacko fall being one in the future, as well as matisse thybule   right now… dwight powell, larry nance jr, also lance stephenson if he were still in the nba i think would classify as a mid but rotation  gerry payton recently, not at the beginning"
"For the Mavs Boban and Moses Brown put up some insane numbers for the minutes they played, like 30/15 per 36. Dwight Powell too, 27/9 per 36 shooting 76%. Who knows, maybe they're all breaking out."
you just get a guy like dwight powell or nerlens noel and then play small ball with saric at center
"&gt; Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  I don't see anything that makes Shamet better than Bullock.   How is he making more than 3x as much as Nic Batum (also not a rookie contract)? How is he making almost double what Patty Mills got (also not a rookie)?   Bryn Forbes was 4th in the entire NBA in 3pt% (45.2%) - better than Shamet has ever shot, including college - and signed for less than half of Shamet's amount (Forbes also isn't on a rookie deal).   Nothing against Waluigi, he got his money and good for him. But value-wise it makes zero sense to overpay for Shamet, who hasn't even shown he can be productive in PHX yet, while penny-pinching on far more valuable players who helped PHX win the West."
We can offer a fairly used Dwight Powell and Trey Burke
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
With your Raptors Flair. Is this some Canadian on Canadian Violence on Dwight Powell?  For a second rounder he's a decent rolling big man that has been in the league half a dozen years. Pretty impressive.
don’t sneak dwight powell in there like we ain’t notice
"2014 2nd Round had Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"&gt; And for anyone who wants to cry about that metric 9 of the last 10 MVPs led the league in it.  Ironic to pull this out in a thread about cherrypicked stats.  WS is designed to measure impact in eras before we had play by play stats. It's fine for that, but there's absolutely no reason to use it to compare modern players to each other.  It's a box score stat, and MVP voters love box score stats.   It also horribly overrates big men. In 2021, 11 of the top 20 players in WS/48 were centers. That's not a fluke. It was 10 of 20 in 2020 and 11 of 20 in 2019.   Zubac, Mitchell Robinson, Harrell, Dwight Powell, Jarrett Allen, and Valanciunas are not actually top 10 players, yet WS/48 has had them in. the top 10 in the past 3 seasons."
"Nah Brunson is the only other player on this team. Aho can even partially create for anyone else, we have to have him off the bench. Bullock or Kleber would probably start if we had KP at the 5 but since Kidd wants him at the 4 we're probably starting Dwight Powell in that fifth spot."
"I would never trade KP for Kyrie who might not even play or if he does just leave this summer.  If they want him for Dwight Powell and Jalen Brunson though, let's get it done."
"I met Dwight Powell, Saleh Mehjri, and Devin Harris at MAVS camp."
"This doesn’t meet your qualifier, but in 2019 I was in Vegas for Summer League and “met” a very intoxicated Mark Cuban on the dance floor of the Omnia nightclub. He was with Dwight Powell (and probably others).   Dapped him up, told him I loved his shit and kept it moving."
Same with Dwight powell pumps
"Met Dwight Powell years ago when I was serving tables. Freakishly huge considering how tall he was. Also a super nice guy just out with his date. I’m 6’3” and was about 225 at the time of only muscle, and he still made me feel like a little kid when he stood up."
"WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT BARNES! We could’ve resigned he and KP and just been over the cap then trotted out Luka/THJ/DFS/Barnes/KP with Jalen, maxi, Dwight Powell etc off the bench. I guess we don’t get to sign Seth and Delon Wright if we don’t trade Barnes, but those guys got traded for Josh richardson who turned into Moses brown and a trade exception we won’t use and Delon Wright was turned into James Johnson who turned into JJ Redick who turned into nothing. Yay"
"Yeah it's pretty well known that Rick had a good relationship with a few guys. Dirk, HB, Dwight Powell, and a handful more. It's not surprising, we've all had coworkers that we like and are friends with. But to the people he didn't like, it was very apparent. The cynic in me thinks Rick only played nice with the guys who performed well enough to help Rick keep his job.  Fans don't see it any differently. Rick was being an ass, no question about that, but Rondo straight up left during a playoff game. From a fan point of view, quitting on the team and leaving Dirk hanging, that is unforgivable."
I didn't know dwight powell was Canadian
"I can ask for James Harden while trying to trade away Goran Dragic, if he actually gets traded for Dwight Powell it doesn’t mean I went from Harden to Powell"
Porzingis is a great 3pts shooter and a mediocre post player idk why you'd want to play him in the post.  And since Kidd is already said he wants to start Dwight Powell not like they'll play 5 out any way
"It's the same with the Mavs exchanging him for KP.   With Luka going to be playing a shit ton of minutes and Simmons having no 3 point shot, he doesn't fit our team at all.   We may cringe at Dwight Powell taking 3s but at least he can do it."
Dwight Powell
Dwight Powell
We trade Dwight Powell for Ben Simmons
"Harrison Barnes is very smart. Also Dwight Powell. Got a bachelors from Stanford in Science, Tech, and society."
"Well we need some people on our roster to put the ball on the floor. He also really isn't too bad at it. You cannot have only one guy pressuring the rim and expect to succeed. It's not gonna be Maxi Kleber/Dorian Finney Smith/Reggie Bullock/Dwight Powell/Willie Cauley Stein/Josh Green putting the ball on the floor. Luka, Brunson, Hardaway, and Porzingis need to be able to attack the rim."
"Another thing is that lot of our players are solid players but too similar. There's only so many catch and shoot guys you can have. We have two glaring weaknesses with actual bigs who can play defense and a legitimate ball handler. Brunson is really the only other player with any dribble-drive game, and he's still developing as a playmaker.  Seth always had a little bit of handle and enough savvy to get to the rim or set himself up for midrange pull-ups. There were major moments in the bubble playoffs where he was able to buy himself a bucket when the bench offense stagnated.   Adding Dragic would be a perfect remedy to one of those problems, though if Toronto doesn't buy him out, I'm not sure theres much of an avenue for that to happen if they don't want to take Dwight Powell."
"Yeah!  But, can we trade him for dwight powell?"
"here are some fun stats. the first list below is the top 20 accrued Win Shares for anyone born outside of the US, and the second is the top 20 WS / 48 by the same criteria  'Nique is about as foreign as Kobe and this cross-section misses obv. folks like Tony Parker but i thought it interesting   *Foreign-ish WS Total*  * Tim Duncan * Dirk Nowitzki * Hakeem Olajuwon * Pau Gasol * Steve Nash * Patrick Ewing * Dominique Wilkins * Dikembe Mutombo * Tony Parker * Detlef Schrempf * Manu Ginóbili * Vlade Divac * Al Horford * Marc Gasol * Peja Stojaković * Carlos Boozer * Rudy Gobert * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Rolando Blackman * Kiki Vandeweghe  *Foreign-ish WS / Game*  * Boban Marjanović * Nikola Jokić * Rudy Gobert * Tim Duncan * Clint Capela * Yao Ming * Arvydas Sabonis * Chris Boucher * Dirk Nowitzki * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Joel Embiid * Manu Ginóbili * Ivica Zubac * Jonas Valančiūnas * Dwight Powell * Tiago Splitter * Hakeem Olajuwon * Pau Gasol * Kyrie Irving * Todd MacCulloch"
"The issue with the Dwight Powell hate is - Luka-KP-Dwight Powell lineups are positive on the year. Luka-KP lineups are negative. KP-Dwight Powell lineups are negative. So like, Dwight Powell has utility. But the roster fit is quite poor and Kidd's system is quite poor as well."
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
"He gets paired with the worst lineups, namely Dwight Powell, because no one else outside of Jalen Brunson can create a shot. And even with him those lineups are terrible.  He also has played worse than last year."
"In no way, am I saying we have good roster construction. I'm mostly agreeing with you, but you're just a bit wrong on some situations/taking it too far. Dwight Powell is not an ok wing defender, he's pretty bad honestly. He also isn't very good at the PNR anymore because his athleticism has major declined. He takes quite a few terrible attempts at the rim too.   Completely agree there's not enough NBA starting caliber talent, but that doesn't mean Kleber/DFS/Bullock can't be valuable pieces. If the rest of the talent is there, all three of them can slide in as a starter. But the issue is having three of those guys without the talent around just pins everything onto one player. Kleber, like you said thought is 100% a 4. Our best lineup is when he plays PF and Porzingis plays Center, but I think the coaching staff wants to protect KP's health and limit his fouls by playing him at PF.   I also think you are imprinting a bit of Knicks KP's problem onto current KP. He has become a much better rebounder on the Mavs, and has been decent defensively. Agreed that his interior presence is very on and off though. Occasionally, there's just plays at the rim, where its like why did u have no impact. I also think he's much more willing to bump inside offensively than in the past.   There's just lot of teams that I think would love some of the guys on our team, but for us its just constructed poorly. I think Maxi would be great for Portland. Bullock was great for the Knicks last year. Dorian could play a Jerami-Grant type role for Denver. They aren't bad players, but they aren't talented. And they need someone to make plays for them at ALL TIMES."
"Jokic is better than Luka, but Jokic also spends more minutes next to guys like AG and Barton, while lineups with Luka often include 1 dimensional guys like Dwight Powell and Finney-Smith. The Mavs’ best players outside of Luka (Brunson, Hardaway Jr., Porzingis) often play together without Luka, while Luka plays with a lot of lineups that include none or only one of those guys. Luka’s the best way to elevate some of the offensively limited role players we have, so he gets paired with weaker lineups for the benefit of the overall team"
"brunson is good but he's cooled off in the last few games unfortunately after that scorching hot start to the season.   and he's just small he's always going to be a negative defensively even though I do respect the effort he puts in on that end  you have a few nice utility players but mostly theres just not enough NBA starter caliber talent to go around.   bullock.. bench player.  DFS.. bench player.   boban is the kind of guy a coach would bring out as a surprise adjustment in a playoff series and use him for 5-10 spot minutes.  dwight powell is not very good either, he's not good at playing center but he's an OK wing defender when he's allowed to do that.   offensively his skillset is super limited as well consisting almost entirely of catching PNR passes from luka and trying to finish at the rim.  WCS as you say is trash he probably shouldn't even be in the league at this point, he inspires no fear in anyone attacking him because he can get pushed around by a stiff breeze  kleber is a nice player and offball defender but he's had health issues this season and is not really a great substitute for an actual starting center.   he could probably give you 15-20 capable minutes a game at power forward though next to a real center  and then you have KP of course who has been playing pretty great recently.  but with the injury concerns and his obvious preference for playing outside the paint he's kind of questionable to play center for any kind of real minutes, or even power forward.    even on his best day defensively he's not a great interior presence.. he gets boxed out by much smaller people and has trouble boxing anyone out.   he has been putting up a few blocks here and there which is very welcome but still way too many possessions he's just a non factor on the inside and people look to attack and exploit him"
Dwight Powell 😤
1. Jokic 2. Clint Capela 3. Embiid 4. Dwight Powell 5. Julius Randle 6. Jeremi Grant 7. Marcus Smart 8. Aaron Gordon 9. Kyle Anderson 10. Jusef Nurkic 11. Wiggins
"Lmao swing and a miss king.   Any fan would much rather be in Knicks's situation than in Mavs situation.   Knicks - have their picks, have someone else's picks (lmao), have a young roster with tradeable talent, cap space, and a great coach.   Mavs - can't use their picks in trade, have basically no tradeable talent beyond Brunson, no cap space, paying max money to a dude who can't stay healthy, and have a coach that nobody else would even poke with someone else's finger. Luka is the fucking shit, though, I'll give you that.  Fun fact - Knicks are paying less to Kemba (who they can easily perma-bench because they have great guard rotation) than Mavs are paying Dwight Powell (who you can't perma bench because the Mavs have a shite big rotation)."
"yeah but in the interim he's far from their biggest issue.  I actually think he's been pretty solid for them and KP has been playing his best ball in years  just nobody could win with that tissue soft interior defense.   it's one of the biggest things you can control in your defensive scheme and mavs have almost no interior presence.   KP can do a bad center impersonation sometimes but with his injury history and his preference for playing on the outside it's a dodgy proposition.   Even on his best day defensively he'll still get abused on the inside on most possessions and has trouble boxing out  and it only gets worse from him, WCS gets pushed around by a stiff breeze.  dwight powell can barely jump and is clearly better as a wing defender than rim defense.  boban can play 10-15 minutes a game tops.  moses brown is a big question mark because of his lack of playing time but if he was showing in practice that he can lock down the rim then kidd would already be starting him and playing him 25 minutes"
"mavs fans are used to seeing people throw lobs over dwight powells helpless outstretched arms by this point  if anyone tracks teams that get lobbed on the most I'd guess that the mavs are up there, and probably the highest out of any team that isn't trying to tank like the rockets  powell in particular gets victimized because of his lack of vertical leap, feels like every single mavs game there's a highlight where he's on the wrong end of a highlight lob play"
"You’re just butt hurt we didn’t give dragic up so he could join his buddy Luka. Not our fault Dwight Powell is ass and on a worse contract than dragic.   Also Masai and Webster aren’t dumb. Raptors are one of best run franchises over the last decade. Buying him out right makes no sense at all. Either he gives up a ton of salary(which dragic doesn’t seem inclined to do, and I don’t blame him) or we wait until trade deadline and his salary cap hit isn’t as high any more and more teams can take him on. Your front office is trash….."
No they didn’t and we still don’t want him ass Dwight Powell.
i’ll give you one dwight powell for him then
one dwight powell coming up
No most raptors fans said they have no reason to buy him out or trade him for bum ass Dwight Powell. I'm sure if dragic wanted out bad enough he would agree to buy out.
"Why would the Mavs trade a 25 year old Brunson (he's on a $1M deal), they would need to also add Dwight Powell or Maxi Kleber to salary match.  Most Dragic deals were centered around either Josh Green + salary filler or just one of Powell/Kleber."
Taken by Dwight fucking Powell😭
You want one slightly used Dwight Powell?
"If you watch Dwight Powell and WCS play, you would know who makes who better..."
"Iono man, Dwight Powell hits every 3 against the clippers"
"He might have a point, I mean I'm a huge fan of Dwight Powell but I think HOF is a bit of a stretch."
"As a mavs fan, I’m not going to even scroll to find the Dwight Powell comments lol"
"We shouldn't hate Dwight Powell. I hate a front-office which extended his contract with one year on his old deal.  At market value, without a team option in the third year. For a player reliant on his at the time elite athleticism. Usually if you give a non-max player security early, the team gets more control in return. Mavs got nothing.   Of course that decision got immediately punished as DP tore his achilles in the last year of his previous contract.  It's just another case of cap malpractice. Nobody was lining up to pay  more than 3y/$33m in free agency even when healthy.  At the very least the third year should have been a team option. Then the deal would have been less disastrous."
Dwight Powell
Dwight powell
Dwight Powell with the Mavs deserves consideration.  We will trade him for Bamba or Suggs and relieve the Magic of their bad starters. 😁
DWIGHT POWELL. Smh. Mavs fans (and mavs Twitter specifically) despises this man.
"Dwight Powell. He somehow has gotten paid $11 million a year for what feels like a decade to catch 3 lobs a game and defend like he’s a college guard instead of the most athletic freak on the floor. I think he doesn’t get as much hate as he did a few years ago, but every time I see his face in the starting lineup I grimace and sigh"
"Trey Burke is probably the closest thing we have to this. Willie Cauley-Stein frustrates our fan base to no end, but I don’t think he’s disliked. Also - shoutout to Dwight Powell for people hating the role he gets out in (although he’s very well liked as a person)"
Dwight Powell
Dwight Powell is not that bad. He's not good but he definitely isn't the worst starter in the league. He has a narrow role but he is functional within it
Dwight Powell or WCS
Bamba is not in the running? Maybe Avery Bradley Dwight Powell or Harkless excluding under 24 guys
"This is true, but he literally just did this same dunk again to Dwight Powell a couple nights ago"
"I always thought he's a pf tbh, don't you have dwight powell starting"
Put some respect on Canadian superstar Dwight Powell
"I wouldn't call Dwight Powell curling off a screen ""nothing of interest""."
RIP Dwight Powell
You had to remind me that Dwight Powell is still on our team? I HATE YOU
"no he should definitely stay so he can play with willie cauley stein and dwight powell  you can have knox after we waive him.   you collect all the knicks players, we'll just take one from you"
"I mean if the knicks traded randle for porzingis we would immediately become a very bad team again rather than the respectable mid-table fringe playoff team we are right now.   He's a soft interior presence and he can't box out very well, he's too in love with his 20 foot jumper which has never been a high value shot.   He has trouble integrating into offensive systems with a lot of ball motion and prefers to iso and pop.    He's also a major injury risk and odds are he'll miss significant amounts of time this season and every season going forward, you can't really rely on him being available.  randle on average has been much healthier for his career  whereas randle would immediately become the mavericks best frontcourt player and 2nd best playmaker.   he'd give you a defensive anchor that you don't get from dwight powell or KP or anyone else in that group, outside of maybe boban who can barely play more than 10 minutes per game.  and thats not even getting into their contracts where randle is on a 22 million a year salary compared to KP's taxing 30 mil a year salary  &gt;Randle is a positive asset in what world  in what world is KP a positive asset.   teams would give us valuable stuff in return for randle, while you would have to pay extra picks or players just to get another team to take KP from you"
"I mean I Dwight Powell is a little bit better then ben, so sixers would have to throw in 3 fr picks."
Let me introduce you to Dwight Powell.
Dwight Powell is a honorable mention too
Dwight Powell is pretty young right?
"3, mainly from our center.   Luka works well with 5 outs and deep threat, problem is , Dwight Powell isn't exactly a deep threats, but he's also simultaneously our best lobber"
Yeah someone like dwight powell they gotta trade miles bridges for him
WHAT IS DWIGHT POWELL DOING ON THE FLOOR??
We’ve been running the exact same starting lineup of Luka - THJ - Dorian Finney Smith - KP - Dwight Powell for two years now and we will continue to do so until the end of time.
Can a combination of Tim Hardaway Jr and Dwight Powell be on that list

"Dwight Powell cannot be in at this time. God I miss Maxi, he solves these rotation problems"
Dwight Powell becoming Rodman lol
Vs. Lakers Dwight Powell is mvp caliber
Build around Dwight Powell
I just never want to see dwight powell play the game of basketball ever again. Is that too much to ask?
KP even looks the wrong way and they’re asking for the water out to check in over him. And as I say this I’m fighting the urge to say the water boy would be better than dwight Powell to not prove myself completely right about our fan base lol
"Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith and Luka almost play exclusively together. Dwight is a 9th/10th man and DFS has been atrocious shooting the ball early. Luka hasn't been great but it's hard to have a Plus Minus stat that is good when you are playing with two deadweight teammates and +/- is such a team stat."
Not really. They got blown out a couple of games and Dwight powell starts still for some reason so their bench is stronger relatively than the starters
Haven't watched much of Dwight Powell since he got hurt. He seemed like a great energy guy and role man a few years ago. Has he regressed? Just never improved?
"Our starting lineup had a really rough shooting start to the season, and we kept getting bailed out by our bench, specifically Jalen Brunson, our 2nd round pick from the Luka draft. Also, Dwight Powell has no business being a starter in the NBA, and yet...  Not trying to absolve Luka here of any particular blame, he was kinda ass for the first 8 games or so."
"Jalen Brunson is looking like a young Kyle Lowry for us right now. KP the past couple games is looking like an all-star again since he's fully healthy, mobile, and playing well with Luka.  Our role players aren't bad, but we're starting Dwight Powell at C and it's really hurting us most games. We need an upgrade or to do something else there if we can't play KP heavy minutes in that role.  Luka hasn't even been playing that well by his standards of play. But our season to start has also been easy. We're mostly beating worse teams or good teams that are missing players. Hopefully if Luka isn't injured we can prove ourselves in the double matches vs the Suns and Clippers in our next 4 games."
I mean his primary defenders were WCS and Dwight Powell….. even a blind dude would be able to score on them
"i see a lot of space given to jumó shooters, any center can overpower dwight powell, kp has decent interior defense but terrible perimeter defense, but still a lot of open shots tonight. if anyone gets their offense going half right everything’s wide open for them  also what are we 18th drtg in the league or something? not that big of an improvement"
Dwight Powell ran on the court during the scuffle which is an automatic 2 game suspension. It would be a shame if someone contacted the league office snitching on him
"If I ever see Dwight Powell in a closing lineup, I will go to that Mavs game, get on the court, and bitch slap Kidd myself. This lineup of Brunson/Luka/THJ/Bullock/KP to close out the game was absolutely beautiful"
"WS is designed to measure impact in eras before we had play by play stats. It's fine for that, but there's absolutely no reason to use it to compare modern players to each other.  It also horribly overrates big men. In 2021, 11 of the top 20 players in WS/48 were centers. That's not a fluke. It was 10 of 20 in 2020 and 11 of 20 in 2019.  Zubac, Mitchell Robinson, Harrell, Dwight Powell, Jarrett Allen, and Valanciunas are not actually top 10 players, yet WS/48 has had them in the top 10 in the past 3 seasons."
"I bet he's better than our starting center, Dwight Powell"
"lukas teammates end up becoming spot up shooters because thats who they are.  KP and THJ are spot shooters, KP especially hates going to the rim unless its wide open.   look how much better and smoother their offense looks with a secondary creator like brunson sharing the floor with luka  are you trying to tell me alex len and damian jones are worse than dwight powell?  that man cannot jump. he calls for lobs and teammates ignore him because nobody trusts him to finish them.  you think luka can't run a PNR with collins when he has one of the best PNR games in the league?  and they still dont have a real center, KP can't play center.  they only have boban who can barely play any minutes.  if KP tries to play center he will probably get hurt again"
luka simply doesn't have the same passing threats that trae does  who is luka's lob threat?  porzingis the guy with no core strength or dwight powell the guy who cant jump?  meanwhile collins and capela were finishing everything last year
"Our bench is very solid rn, its our starting lineup that lacks versatile players outside of Luka/KP. Frank Ntilikina has played very well, Reggie Bullock was a key starter for the Knicks last year, and we still have Maxi Kleber who was injured tonight.   But I'm convinced Dwight Powell is not even a 9th or 10th man in other teams rotations. Like you guys are 4-8 and both Poeltl and Eubanks are better than Powell. Even on non-playoff teams, I don't think Powell would deserve minutes. Our center rotation is BAD."
"The mavs need to give Luka more help. Dwight Powell starting? Dude would be like 9th or 10th in most other teams rotations.  KP playing well helps, but god damn their bench is awful other than Brunson."
"Simmons and Maxey for Dwight Powell, WCS, Burke and a 2nd round pick"
For the far superior Dwight Powell of course
"We have to take Dwight Powell and Trey Burke back to make a deal happen with Dallas, I'm not taking just a 2nd to take back their 14 mill guaranteed money next season."
"Trey Burke, Dwight Powell, Josh Green, WCS"
"He hasn’t been out of shape tbh he’s struggling just as much at the beginning of games lol. The Olympics were like a month ago, the out of shape thing is ridiculous. He just couldn’t make a shot and our spacing has been pretty abysmal which has led to him posting up more and when those shots aren’t hitting the entire offense grinds to a halt.  Luka almost exclusively plays with Dwight Powell and that’s clearly intentional, part of me thinks by Luka."
"Trade Dwight Powell for Dragic, get Robin Lopez from Magic."
"&gt; Dragic also just might not even be good enough to be worth trading a guy like Dwight Powell anyway.  You should probably rethink that. I'll have fireworks if we package Powell, WCS and Green for Dragic."
They have to be willing to give up assets because their only salary filler is Dwight Powell and Trey Burke who both have another year after this one. That's what stopped it from getting done in the offseason. They wanted us to give them Dragic for nothing but we wanted something to take on their shit salary filler.
"Dallas can only send back longer term salary to match Dragic's $20 million, and nothing they package with it will be worth it for Toronto. Dragic also just might not even be good enough to be worth trading a guy like Dwight Powell anyway."
"It's so annoying how we generate great looks and end up hitting the 3, only for the play to be called back because fucking Dwight Powell likes to bump into everyone's ass!"
"He is out of shape, overweight, can't move fast, shooting terrible at 43/28/70. Yet his average is still 24,5ppg, 8rpg and 7 ass. Then he plays with two of the worst starters NBA (Finney-Smith and Powell) DFS is shooting 25% on 5 wide open 3s per game he is creating for him. He also can't do anything else on O, he can't even dribble the ball. Not to mention Dwight Powell, who is the worst player starting in NBA."
"The defense thing is crazy. Idk if it was a 2-3 or a 3-2 zone but they were running this zone with the SF in the paint, either doe doe or even Luka at one point, with KP on the side. It allowed KP to come over to help instead of being the primary inside defender. It does tend to give up 3’s but the paint defense is miles better for it.   And also, it’s kinda necessary because KP fucking SUCKS as a primary interior defender. Like, it’s comically bad. Not only does he get bullied but by GOD does this man jump for pump fakes. He has absolutely zero timing and is moved way too easily inside. Same thing with Dwight Powell.   But, the crazy part is that both KP and Dwight are actually very serviceable as help side defenders. Though their timing and positioning when they’re the primary defenders are god awful, their help timing is actually serviceable. Even last game, for how terrible Dwight was, he had a couple crazy help side blocks on lay up attempts. So the scheme that Kidd uses in having the interior being clogged by a 3 or 4 then having the 5 come over to help actually plays to their strengths. It just means there’s less perimeter defense, which is something the mavs are just gonna have to gut out and hope their rotations are on point. It’s an adjustment from last year that’s surprisingly effective so far.   That offense though. Maybe it’ll look better when players start hitting shots but there’s plenty of examples of terrible spacing for inside attempts. Yeah, they’re generating a billion open 3s but there hasn’t been a lot of action going to the rim that works due to spacing. That needs to be worked out."
"&gt; Haven't watched the Mavericks much, are they that bad with their starters?  Mavs 101, OP:  * First major issue is Dwight Powell. He knows how to do one thing, and that is setting screens. But his screens are clearing up no space, because KP now roams closer to the paint. Now, KP is playing his best ball since the bubble, so this change *is* working, but Powell is a wonky fit. We had a really better offense with Maxi, but he's injured for who knows how long. Luka's bread and butter is driving through a screen and choose between kicking to the corner or throwing the floater. Without the paint space, he is just chucking contested jumpers;  * On +/-, the team as a whole impacts the results, and, other than KP, THJ, Brunson and (yes) Ntilikina, *everyone* is in a cold spell. Bullock and DFS were constantly ranging the 40% from the 3, and both are barely making 20%. Sterling Brown took 6 games to knock down his first 3. Hell, KP before the injury was also in a cold spell. Kidd's offense is generating A LOT of open looks. I repeat, A L-O-T. People are being schemed wide open in the corner or at the key and proceeding to throw bricks. Someone in our sub posted that Luka had 21 possible assists last night, and the bricks that resulted on those open, good looks could build houses for an entire city;  * Kidd's offense works better with Brunson because he is faster. Brunson is nifty, he doesn't need a lot of space to slash, it is quite similar to Ja Morant in that aspect. His floater doesn't require well-set screens, and he is playing recklessly. Kidd gave him the reigns of the 2nd unit and he rode it right to the point that it's tough not to give him the starting nod alongside Luka. Also, Ntilikina plays gnerally with Brunson, and the French Prince is being AMAZING. Catch and shoot threat with borderline elite defense. Oh, and Brunson rarely plays with Powell, so there's that;  * Finally, Luka is off as a whole. He ranges wildly between being hesitant on half court and going full hero ball. Last night he had a lot of open looks that he just ignored because he was bent on banging bodies in the post and hitting the Dirk fadeaway that was ice cold against that Bulls defense. He chose a contested jumper against Vuc instead of doing his signature move of dropping back and throwing the stepback 3. I would say this is less about Luka playing bad basketball and more about him playing dumb, low BBIQ game. As I said, when he is off, the ball moves faster, our pace improves, shots begin to fall and we get in a rhythm. When he goes back, the offense just turns a drama show, where the wings more or less sit on the corner, KP isn't sure about what to do and Powell set up ghost screens that doesn't block anyone. It doesn't help that Luka is relying so much on bad efficient iso looks instead of running the hot hand. Kudos that this isn't an ego thing, because he played second fiddle to Brunson quite often and no pout was to be seen;  * Finally, we are 7-4 because of our defense. All issues on offense with Kidd, his defense is the best I've seen of the Mavs in the last years. KP was unlocked again working on help D, Ntilikina is a monster, Bullock and DFS are playing solid defense, hell, even Luka already had 2 games with 2+ steals and had that nasty block over Sengun. Whenever Powell checks out, our defense is legit elite."
"Is because he's always on the floor with Dwight Powell and DFS, who both have been by far the worst players on the mavs, Jkidd is for some reason obsessed with playing the 3 of them togheter"
dwight powell
We can make Dwight Powell and WCS stay in Chicago if you want :)
"Man, Dwight Powell really does not want to give us space to give him excuses."
Why we still letting Dwight Powell shoot 3s
Dwight Powell   seriously though
I wonder if Norman Powell and Dwight Powell are related
"We play Dwight Powell and KP, almost the exact same; don't argue it"
Dwight Powell
Dwight Powell
"Dude it's pretty close but Joel Embiid might be a better fit than Dwight Powell, idk maybe I'm wrong"
just where did dwight powell ever get the idea that he should shoot threes
"ok, dwight powell for jokic then"
If you want one slightly used Dwight Powell in return
"Dwight Powell for Marcus Smart, who says no?"
We offer a gently used Dwight Powell
Dwight Powell for Myles Turner straight up  You would like that Carlisle right? Lol
May we interest you in a KP coming off a healthy off season plus Dwight Powell for Turner? Please? I mean we let you get Rick for free.
Dallas: Could I interest you in one slightly used Dwight Powell...
Dude Dwight Powell has another year left and Dragic is an expiring contract. It's obvious who's the more negative contract here.
What about Dragic for Dwight Powell ? Dwight is 11M per year Btw. He's canadian and can fit your needs btw
"Mavs will counter with    Boban Marjanović, Kristaps Porziņģis, Willie Cauley-Stein, Moses Brown, Dwight Powell"
But would you actually want Dwight Powell? That’s the big question
A team that misses out on other free agent pgs. Maybe you guys for Dwight Powell
Would they be interested in one slightly used Dwight Powell? Then the Mavs could take on Dragic
"Every single draft has some big guy who is pretty decent that goes late. Claxton was pick 31. Mitchell Robinson was 36. Timelord, 27 in the same draft. Thomas Bryant went 42. Jarrett Allen went 22 the same draft. Zubac, 32nd.  2015 had Nance 27, Portis 22, Hernangomez 35, Richaun Holmes 37, Montrezl Harrell 32. The year before was Jokic at 41, Dwight Powell at 45, and Capela at 25. The year before that? Dieng was 21, Plumlee 22, Gobert 27. Before that? Draymond at 35.   Every year, there's perfectly serviceable 5s available between pick 20 and pick 45. Every year."
"Will the Nets have cap space in the foreseeable future? Harden, KD, and Irving should put them at or near the cap. Trez is an expiring, so by next offseason he’ll be off the books. They don’t have cap space this offseason, so I don’t see how he harms their flexibility for the future.   In terms of trading him, the 2nd option you mentioned could be a possibility and that’s what I was thinking of. For example, the Mavs have Dwight Powell making $11 million each of the next 2 years. If the Mavs wanted to clear space, the Nets could take that salary on and give them Trez as an expiring.   Another exampleC Luka Kennard is on a ~$13 mil annual contract for several years. If the Clippers want to move on from that long term money, maybe they trade for Trez and an expiring min contract at the end of this next season.   The Nets aren’t going to get anyone great just by trading an expiring, but there will be opportunities where a team wants to open up cap space and dump long-term money, and that’s where a $10 mil expiring can be useful. You’re only going to get back someone who’s overpaid, but that’s not a big concern if you’re over the cap with 3 max contract stars anyways."
You are getting local hero Dwight Powell.
"This is so good for the mavs, last season we legit had 0 nba caliber centers, WCS can't defend bc he's so skinny, same thing for KP, and Dwight Powell is undersized af, a center that can roll and defend will do wonders to our offense and defense"
Dwight Powell next. Lol
Bertans for Trey Burke and Dwight Powell???
"Cmon Rick, i know deep down you still fuckin love dwight ""elite screener, godlike roller, and culture setter"" powell"
eh i feel like dwight powell would be very useful in FIBA
Mike Tobey &gt; Dwight Powell
"JRich has only 1 year (if he picks up his player option), Dwight Powell has 2 more years. Both are making around $10 mil each so not bad contracts, but they’re probably neutral value at best so I’d expect the Mavs to at least add in a pick or a young player or something to make it more fair. Maybe Powell + JRich + Jalen Brunson?"
Raps need a center right? Can we interest you in one moderately used Dwight Powell? He's Canadian too
"I wouldn't hate a trade centered around Dwight Powell or Josh Richardson, depending on how it's arranged."
Maybe Shamet and DJ for Dwight Powell?
How about Dwight Powell to replace Jaxson Hayes after his new felony charge lol?
"Eh, I actually think Doncic’s on-ball brilliance would open up a ton for Simmons as a roll man and secondary playmaker. Doncic creates so many advantages, and Simmons is good on capitalizing on those, but struggles to create them himself at times. Simmons on the Mavs would be like if Dwight Powell suddenly had incredible court vision and could lock down the other team’s best perimeter option."
What are you even on about. What KP does in the pick and pop (because he hardly rolls) is irrelevant to what we are talking about. Gobert is a fantastic pick-and-roll player. One of the best roll men in the league. He's incredibly limited offensively.   Luka pick and roll is good with everyone who is semi-functional. One of the best pick and roll combo's in the entire NBA in 2019 was Luka and Dwight Powell.   Show your work. KP as the screener is good for 1.12 PPP this season.   Again that's not relevant to what we are talking about. We are talking about KP's ability to create offence.    Not every team has personal to switch pick and rolls obviously. The bad news is the further you go in the playoffs the more likely you are to face a team that can.
&gt; In terms of analytics maybe the best lob-finisher of all time  How does one find analytics on this? Luka and Dwight Powell had a really good lob game before Powell ruptured his achilles
He can't create his own offence. The second you start switching KP pick and roll he mine as well be Rudy Gobert. About 20% of his baskets were unassisted last season which is in the range of players like Willy Cauley Stine and Dwight Powell.  You can guard KP with Reggie Jackson and he is incapable of getting a quality look.
"Tobey dives really well to the basket off the pick and roll; when we played the Lakers with AD playing, doubling Luka made Dwight Powell look like prime Deandre Jordan. Like, doubling can work at times but it will not work once Luka figures it out"
"Ahh yes, lakers killer Dwight Powell. Haha"
"Lakers fans, interested in any of:  Jalen Brunson  Josh Richardson  Dwight Powell  Trey Burke  ?"
"&gt; For one, Dallas' roster shrinks significantly and their best post player becomes Dwight Powell (not that great)  Wtf lmao Luka is by far our best post player"
&gt; His $13M contract starts this year and I’m not a big fan of that  lmao that's so fucking cheap what are you talking about? Lakers not gonna splash Dwight powell money on their 5th scorer?
"Dame, PG, Dwight Powell."

Man I thought it was dwight Powell and I was really confused for a second
Dwight Powell needs minutes. He just does stuff. He's not good on defense but he is annoying in a way Kleber isn't.
DWIGHT POWELL &gt; PREZTEL CAN PORZINGIS
Dwight Powell bringing insane energy
"I feel like I like Dwight Powell more than Dallas fans do, but maybe that was just when he was struggling earlier in the season."
Free Dwight Powell
Wow Dwight Powell is better than KP. At least he plays with effort
"Who is better, Giannis or Dwight Powell?"
I have been dying to see Dwight Powell all series
man put Dwight Powell in there
I did not expect a Boban + KP starting lineup... was expecting Dwight Powell
"I'd perform the ritual sacrifice of Josh Richardson and Dwight Powell on national TV to have Dray even just coach the Mavs on defense, let alone play for us. He elevates everyone around him on that end of the floor so much."
is one of them Rick Carlisle and Dwight Powell?
"&gt;Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance  I don't think Jrue was the solution, they needed forward depth not a second PG.  Hayward, Jae Crowder, Bobby Portis, etc are all good defensive forwards that Portland could have gone after in FA, hell even Tristan Thompson or even  Dwight or Javale could have been good defensive backup centers. Trades aside, they had options and just didn't pursue anything. It's honestly baffling.  Then there's trades. I'm confident they could've traded for some good defensive 3&amp;D forwards from rebuilding teams like Taurean Prince or Kelly Olynik, not to mention guys like PJ Tucker or Aaron Gordon who got picked up by contenders for basically nothing. Gary Trent Jr is literally a better defender than Powell and they packaged that trade with picks which to this day still makes no sense.  Sorry Portland fans, you guys have an atrociously lazy FO"
"Let me tell you, nothing is more legendary than the Dwight Powell pump fake"
At least you have DWIGHT POWELL who makes 10+ million per year.  &gt;Dwight Powell	0:00	0-0	0-0	0-0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
What happened to Dwight Powell ?
They already have Dwight.. Powell
Yeah lets bank on WCS for the rest of the playoffs rather than believe in our guy who can potentially score 20+. I’m not saying Porzingis will get to form in these playoffs but it’s completely braindead to bench him when WCS or Dwight Powell are gonna be just as bad as KP’s worst days
"I would start Luka, THJ, DFS, Boban, Dwight Powell"
The Mavs as a team almost have nine different countries represented  Luka: Slovenia  KP: Latvia  Boban: Serbia  Josh Green: Australia  Melli: Italy  Dwight Powell: Canada  Maxi: Germany  Finney-Smith: USA
Luka made Powell look like prime Dwight Howard against the Lakers so it's not hard to imagine how the actual D12 would fare with the Don.
Its the Dwight Powell Trade all over again.
"Dwight Powell 0 minutes?  Come on, he would have at least got some boards, a few alley ‘oops, and been high energy."
Need more Dwight Powell!
Don't quote me on this but I bet the Mavs play Dwight Powell more in game 4 since the Clippers are going small. Expect hella oops
Dwight Powell needs to replace his ass yesterday. Also JJ Redick needs to get off his podcast and earn his stupid contract.
None of the bigs for the mavs seem to make an impact grabbing boards. Maybe Dwight Powell can make a showing in the next game?
Get Dwight Powell more minutes! At least he tries. Porzingis frequently seems disinterested.
Dwight Powell and Cauley-Stein
Did Dwight Powell regress after the injury?
"Dwight Powell is a stud as long as he can come back from the injury.  Richardson and KP aren’t working out.  If those two were replaced with guys that are worth their salary, or close to worth their salary, it’s one of the top rosters this side of Brooklyn."
certainly the time to put in Dwight Powell
Where the hell is Dwight powell
still flagrant  UNLEASH DWIGHT POWELL!!
Dwight Powell or Bobi time
He was traded with Dwight Powell so...
"Except for Dwight Powell, you know, who was also in the trade."
"Rondo was a throw in on the Dwight Powell trade, Powell still a Mav."
"And Wiggins, RJ Barrett, NAW (Shai’s actual cousin), Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke, and Dwight Powell. The only guys not going to training camp so far are Murray &amp; Shai. Murray must be faking too lol. According to you, Shai rests the entire back half of the season healthy, and is still skipping out on all the marketing and endorsements that would come from being THE guy for team Canada, in order to be ready for the tanking Thunder’s start of the season. How much rest does he need lol?"
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
believe it or not but dwight powell is an nba player
"Completely agree with you on that second part about them bleeding points in drop coverage. I don’t think that part was too Galaxy brained, i think more so he was content with the flow of the game. He always does deop coverage with KP and Bobi (when he plays) because i feel like he doesn’t think their speed matches up. But he usually doesn’t play drop coverage with Willie and Dwight Powell, which is why i was surprised he continued to do the same strategy with them in the game. Usually with those two he has them hedge and recover.   But also you’re right about the defense in general. No matter what tactics may have helped in the end, they still gave up 121 points which isn’t great. I just think he was holding out on doubling in case they really needed it as like a last resort cause it’s their best option. If they started doubling earlier that gives the clips more time to figure out a counter and negate it, then at that point they’re out of options."
"Never forget when he told Dwight Powell, his teammate, that he’d be cut from the Mavs in two years"
Man I love Dwight Powell but I still hate that we lost out on more of Jae Crowder in a Mavs uniform
"That max slot is contingent on Josh Richardson opting out, Hardaway leaving, and moving Dwight Powell for cap relief."
Did that announcer just say Dwight Powell is a swing 3/4? He's a 5 if anything.
Any NBA big brains have an idea why Dwight Powell has been a no-show?
At least put in Dwight Powell
I’d like to see Dwight Powell on the court with Luka. Dwight’s athleticism could give LA fits
"The bench which which was great all year was injured af once the playoffs started. Dwight Powell, WCS, Brunson (which was a 6 moty candidate), Richardson coming off the bench this year. Even Luka had a bum ankle late in the season and was gimpy that whole series last year."
Dwight Powell pump fake
"If everyone was healthy and wants to play we would have:   SGA, Murray, Wiggins, Dort, Boucher, Brooks, Barrett, Tristan Thompson, Khem Birch, Oshae Brissett, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, NAW from the Pels, Cory Joseph"
"Off the top of my head we have Olynyk, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson, and Dwight Powell. I'm not sure which of them will decide to play though."
Dwight Powell didnt tore his achilles just for this disrespect
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
Heat making themselves look bad   So let’s slander the Sixers Ben Simmons Dwight Powell with handle let’s talk about it
We’re still better Ben Simmons is Dwight Powell with handle and y’all gave him 100 mil lol
Are we sure they didn’t sign Dwight Powell because it sounds like white power
Capela would be a monster. Dwight Powell was the most efficient roll man in the league last year before his injury but Capela would be a whole other beast.
Dwight Powell sucks dude idk why the Mavs are so hard for him
why is dwight powell not playing?
"Dwight Powell has played pretty well whenever I’ve watched him with Luka, Rick what’s up"
I just noticed that Dwight Powell have not played any minutes yet. I wonder why?
Why isnt Dwight Powell who was prime shaq against the lakers playing
And Dwight Powell
BBRef's position estimates are flawed. They put the taller player as the bigger position. Porziņģis like I said is not a typical 4 or 5. He's an offensive 4 and defensive rim protector. When he plays with WCS or Dwight Powell he is most certainly our PF.
JV with that Dwight Powell 3pt pump fake.
"There was definitely surprise among other FO’s around the league - GSW passed on trading Klay for him, WAS didn’t want to trade Beal, CHA passed on trading #2 (which became MKG) where OKC wanted to draft Beal, TOR passed on trading Valanciunas and Powell, and I’m possibly missing one more. The next best offer rumored at the time was to ORL for a package centered around JJ Redick. These are all before those guys turned the corner and became stars - Klay wasn’t Klay yet, Beal was a rookie, Val was a solid C and Powell a rotation wing, even Redick wasn’t who he became yet. WAS/GSW/TOR all had PGs as well already in Wall/Steph/Lowry and probably didn’t love the pairing.  Morey to his credit wasn’t surprised, although he probably was bailed out by the CP3 trade being blocked by Stern (they wouldn’t have had the cap room to trade for Harden because they would have had Pau Gasol on a large contract, plus I think they would have used some other assets to make it happen). Harden in ORL probably doesn’t go nearly as well as HOU did especially with Dwight still being there and how poorly they worked in HOU.  It’s hard to find great comps for that scenario because so few rookies start as a 6th man especially at the top of the draft. LaMelo was previously mentioned, he’s a good one although he had more hype than Harden in his draft. Trae’s close but he’s gotten way more runway to start his career than Harden did. Maybe if Fox or Haliburton made it to that level, although Haliburton is much more unlikely to project so highly."
"We have two true centers in Boban and Willie Cauley-Stein. Neither are starting options, nor do they mesh super well with our starters. Dwight Powell is a roll man that cannot space the floor or defend, he's very limited, and Maxi Kleber is undersized as a center and is more of a PF who can play spot minutes at SF or C.   Porziņģis is a 4/5, more so a PF in the regular season and a Center in the playoffs. I think pairing him with a center who can switch out on the perimeter would be smart. Having Holmes if we could get him for $15M a year would be great. He'd be a roll threat for Luka, while KP can pop on the perimter or take his man off the dribble. He's a decent rebounder too. None of our bigs are starting caliber for a contender aside from Porziņģis and maybe Kleber."
"It’s why he wears 77, he wanted 7 but Dwight Powell was already wearing it."
"Dallas also has Jalen Brunson, Dwight Powell and KP all healthy this time around."
I’m gonna pretend 60. Powell is Dwight Powell and there’s nothing anyone can do to convince me otherwise.
1. Luka   2. KP   3. Jalen Brunson   4. Tim Hardaway Jr.   5. Dorian Finney-Smith   6. Maxi Kleber   7. Dwight Powell  8. Josh Green
"When the Lakers tried this, the Mavs busted it open with the pick and roll. Luka had 13 assists and Dwight Powell had a season high 25 pts. Doubling one of the best passers in the league isn't a great strategy, it turns out"
"Clippers fans don't realize how many important Mavs role players were missing in that series.  No Jalen Brunson, Dwight Powell or Willie Cauley Stein. KP missed half the series and Luka hurt his ankle in game 3.  That's like Kawhi turning his ankle, PG going down mid series, no Lou Will, No Zubac, no Trez for any game."
"If u wanna say their stats were basically the same go ahead, but Luka had morris kawhi PG and 2-3 other players all rotating on him with no 2nd stat for 2.5 games and gave everyone the work..... while on a bum ankle for 2 games. Anyone who watched that series will tel u Luka was the best player. Mavs didn’t even have Dwight Powell the whole series either, they had to play my man Boban out there often and we love the guy but he’s a huge ass liability defensively. Not to mention Kawhi clearly having the better team around him"
He's garbage at best hell be a poor mans Dwight Powell.
Idk why you got downvoted because it’s true. Everyone talks about the Clippers getting better without mentioning our 6th man/secondary ball handler in Brunson and Dwight Powell/WCS (our top 2 centres and best PnRs) having missed the entire series and KP missing half the series. Everyone talks as if last year was the exact same team they’re getting this year.
"The fully healthy starting lineup throughout the year has been  * ⁠Luka 6’7” * ⁠Josh Richardson 6’5” * ⁠Dorian Finney-Smith 6’7” * ⁠Maxi Kleber (lately Dwight Powell) 6’10 * ⁠Porzingis 7’3”  Please match players above to positions PG, SG, SF, PF and C, one to each.  Really, who else is the PG if not Luka?"
Dwight Powell is up there on the assisted picks chart almost exclusively for Luka
Luka's targets:  1. Dwight Powell (27) 2. Willie Cauley-Stein (21) 3. Kristaps (14) 4. DFS (7) 5. Maxi (5) 6. Josh Green &amp; THJ (3) 7. Boban (1)
Willing to bet Boucher see’s some minutes at the 5 in international ball. Also y’all seriously sleeping on Khem Birch and Dwight Powell will all the Kelly O love at the 5
"&gt; Luka plays the 4  The fully healthy starting lineup throughout the year has been * Luka 6’7” * Josh Richardson 6’5” * Dorian Finney-Smith 6’7” * Maxi Kleber (lately Dwight Powell) 6’10 * Porzingis 7’3”  Please match players above to positions PG, SG, SF, PF and C."

"the lakers let dwight powell ram the ball down their face 10 straight times but are now whining about other teams being pragmatic. sad, really"
"If you rank the Mavs most important players (when healthy) it sounds be some order of Dwight Powell, maxi, Jalen, DFS, Richardson numbers 3-8 and they were ALL GONE, while KP was recovering from Injury and coming back quickly to try and offer some semblance of reinforcements. It was Luka, THJ, and James Johnson trying to win games lol"
"Crowder is a below league average 3pt shooter who is shooting less than 30% this season.  Maxey is a poor 3pt shooter, and Embiid is below league average.  Luka isnt a good three point shooter, KP is shooting 20% from three this season and Dwight Powell is a poor shooter."
Dwight Powell
Did you just speak ill of your lord and savior Dwight Powell?
I can interest you in a dwight powell?
We have Luka. Yes but brown is far better than any other player on the roster. And Dennis is the same as Brunson. Robert Williams is better than Dwight Powell.   Think about this. Our bench unit relies on frank ntlkina
"Damn. Seems like gaffers is taking all the minutes   Ohhhh. Too bad. Gues the wizards are gonna have to trade Bryant...I guess my Mavs will take him   Might be hard to dethrone the best clapping big in the NBA, Dwight Powell"
"Our starting center is ranked 39th out of 40 starting centers, in terms of rebounding.   Dwight Powell is ass."
Y’all can have Canadian hometown hero   Dwight “You just got pump faked” Powell
"Strengths: having a star player   We have a Luka   Let's us have a little leeway and just spam letting him run things when everything goes to crap   Weakness; Bench PG handler and Center  As everybody knows. Brunson ha stepped up big for the Mavs. And everybody wants to start him, but truthfully, if he start, the bench he no true PG. Frank has played better as a wing handler and Trey Burke is more of a shooting guard in a PGs body.   Ideally for the Mavs   Starting lineup has Luka, Brunson, and KP  With Tim hardaway, Bullick, and Kleber off the bench   The center starting positions for us is ass   Dwight Powell wouldn't start on a single ofher nba team in the league, but he starts here"
Give you hometown hero Dwight Powell plus salary filler for Siakam. Guaranteed he won't take away from Barnes stats if that's what you care about.
Dwight powell
Dwight Powell is starting on the Mavericks
Dwight Powell gonna single handily lose this game with his cluelessness and lack of coordination holy fuck
"Connor McDavid for Dwight Powell. salary matched, both canadian, what's not to like?"
"The margin of error is pretty low when you get a guy who makes you go “oh shit we can compete NOW”   Even KD didn’t move the needle enough for the Sonics/thunder that they still got Westbrook, harden and Ibaka.  So, I think the Mavs recognized that and swung for the fence with Porzingis, and in an alternate reality he averaged 22/11 and 2 blocks and plays 65 games a year and it’s a home run.   You look at the fact that even after Luka’s rookie year (and we tried to tank a bit at the end because our hawks pick was protected) that still only ended up being the 10th pick, Luka made us too good to get any other high lottery talent immediately.   That isn’t to say there weren’t shitty moves! THJ is a win, and let’s assume we still got Porzingis. For the life of me I don’t have any idea why we traded Barnes away. He wasn’t a perfect player and struggled with being the 1st option at times, but he chose us and would’ve been PERFECT WITH Luka and has improved each year  I don’t know if we could’ve gotten Seth if we kept HB but a lineup of Curry/THJ/Luka/HB/Porzingis is very good. The Mavs have been good at finding and developing some talent: pre injury Dwight Powell was decent, the contract is bad. And maxi and DFS are very good, those guys would honestly be perfect with Lebron and AD on the Lakers because they’re spot up shooters and defenders who don’t need the ball. Those guys’ shortcomings aren’t their faults and honestly aren’t our front office either. Neither was drafted and both are good players. But, if we don’t have an AD, we now NEED scoring from our other 3 starters and can’t rely on that from those guys.  If Luka and KP were more like Lebron and AD combining for 50-55 points, we would be fine having two guys not scoring much. But they aren’t starter quality guys on a team that needs scoring"
Dwight Powell and WCS would like a word. Powell can't rebound and WCS can't catch lobs - both things that Deandre is better at.
He's a taller version of Dwight Powell.
But I thought Dwight Powell was salary filler...
You can have Dwight Powell and salary filler
he hasn’t been great by luka standards by any means. but this has come up twice and i need people to understand we’re starting dwight powell at center and he’s fucking terrible. dorian has been awful this year. KP is hurt (lulz) and our arguably best defender in Maxi is also hurt. we just don’t have a lot of talent and that’s really starting to show  brunson is a monster tho
You're not getting any picks for him. You can take Dwight Powell though.
Yeah for sure I’d trade him for Dwight Powell no bias here

That was Dwight Powell
"Why did Dwight Powell only take 3 shots?  Also, please just pay Cauley-Stein to go away."
"Not good. He's trying to implement an offense style that just doesn't work with our roster. He doesn't want Luka to be heliocentric a la James Harden in Houston, which I get and think is a good thing, but we can't afford to not have Luka dominate. Instead Kidd is posting up Dorian Finney Smith or Sterling Brown. Additionally he's playing Dwight Powell and Porziņģis at the same time, and we are playing Porziņģis in the midrange/lowpost. The paint is filled 90% of the time which makes Luka's drives useless.  He has good intentions, like passing the ball around, not relying solely on Luka, but so far it's been fairly unsuccessful. The rotations are bad to mediocre and he's dealing with a flawed and injured roster.  He does seem to have really helped Jalen Brunson's game though so that's a plus.   Overall I'd say 3/10. Carlisle was around an 8/10 while coaching Luka. He got every inch from the 19-21 Mavs, but it wasn't sustainable in the playoffs."
"its more about their lack of rim protection and rebounding  they had 3 fast break points all game because luka is the best rebounder and probably the best low post defender.   so he can't get up the court to run the fast break, he has to hang out by the basket and rebound  they just suck at boxing guys out, WCS gets shoved around like he's made out of paper.  dwight powell can't jump or box people out.   and even when KP is healthy he's not gonna fix those problems, he sucks at rim protection and rebounding too  give them a real center who can pop the ball up the court to luka and you will see their offense improve dramatically.  its probably j.kidds fault too"
Hey we’re paying Dwight Powell 11 million a year what do you want from us???
Does Dwight Powell ever get an offensive rebound? Seems like he goes for it every time and it never works
"dwight powell cannot jump, he gets burned on lob passes constantly"
The gap between Trae and Herro is equivalent to the gap between Bam and Dwight Powell
"dwight powell the center getting boxed out by kyle lowry the point guard, cool cool"
"pretty easy to burn dwight powell who can't move at all  not to take away from herro, he saw the matchup and just immediately went for it"
Dwight Powell
don't worry Dwight Powell will play 30 min
"If Luka had to throw lobs to Capela or Collins, he’d look for them a whole lot more. There’s a giant difference between those 2 and Dwight Powell.   The only other reliable player on the Mavs entire roster is THJ. Atlanta has an actual team.   On the other hand, you think Trae’s numbers are gonna keep going up? If you’re gonna argue Luka has peaked, wouldn’t the same apply for Trae? You saying Luka won’t reach Lebron’s level somehow makes Trae better? Trae is definitely not touching anything close to Lebron’s impact. Ever."
We have enough tweeners who can’t defend real 5s. I’d rather have Dwight Powell who we at least know is a decent rotation player and not particularly injury prone

"2nd worst on teams with playoff aspirations after Dwight Powell. Jordan would start over him in Dallas, that's how bad we are at center."
"in the NBA?  no thats dwight powell.  can't do anything on the floor, can't move, can't defend, cant jump, cant run, cant rebound, cant dribble, fouls constantly.  all he can do is set screens catch passes from luka and get fouled at the rim  should be in the g league if not just retired"
"Excuse me, that roster has Trey Burke and Dwight Powell. Anything but shit"
dwight powell used to have leaps. maybe he doesnt after his injury
"Hawks smartly spent money when they had cap space on Capella, Gallo, and Bogi.  We spent our cap space money on resigning Dwight Powell in 2019. 30M+ of space? Yeah just resign everyone back. Fuck using that, thanks Cuban and Donnie."
"Have you read any of the game threads? Every other comment is fire jason kidd, fuck dwight powell, and this team sucks. I'm not sure what threads you're reading but it's clearly not many of them. You really think Mavs fans think this bullshit is ok? I'm fucking fuming over here after watching that fucking tire fire. That wasn't basketball. We all know how trash this team is, stop generalizing off of two comments you read in a single thread and attributing it to the attitude of an entire sub."
dwight powell would be a third stringer for a contender and he is ostensibly their starting center
"its cause dwight powell is not a starting center, nobody on your team can jump higher than jokic so he just destroyed the glass and they dominated defensively  mavs got no size, they got no good defenders.  even when KP is healthy he's not a good rebounder or defender, they need to get a myles turner or valanciunas type center"
"I swear, Josh Green is just a smaller Dwight Powell. All energy and effort but looks lost basketball wise."
Dwight Powell hitting 3’s makes me feel some type of way
the only person i will be adamant about firing is dwight powell
"Carlisle still likes Dwight Powell, right?"
"I thought so too when we first traded for KP but I think Luka would actually fit better with a rim rolling big or a true 3&amp;D big like Maxi Kleber. KP is too fragile to do a lot of pick and roll as the roll guy. He can pick &amp; pop but it's not as effective as the roll. And while he can shoot the 3 and space the floor, he clearly prefers to post up and shoot mid range shots off the dribble. So it turns out, they actually aren't as great a fit as you'd think on paper.   I was really hoping we would get Richaun Holmes this past offseason because I desperately want to see Luka with a better rim runner than Dwight Powell. At this point I hope we can just find a way to get rid of KP's contract without giving up too many assets in return and just try again in free agency I suppose."
"thats true but if you shuffle the pieces around luka and KP their team defense could improve too.  I thought they should have made a play for nerlens noel last year and run him at C.   if they can pry valanciunas away from new orleans he would totally revitalize their defense.   but they need to get the guys signed, the mavs have run the same starting lineup for 3 straight years at this point  the mavs are like obsessed with starting dwight powell at center and he's just awful.   he's got butterfingers and he can't defend for shit.   mavs fans theorize that cuban is fixated on trying to make dwight powell work because he came along with rondo in the disastrous trade with boston and given rondo's infamous exit cuban is obsessed with trying to ""win"" that trade by making powell a thing.  offensively the KP/luka pairing was their most effective scoring engine last year, if they are going to move on from that it needs to be replaced with something better not just bumping maxi kleber up in the rotation"
"Dwight powell, Richard Holmes"
Dwight Powell is honestly a bigger problem. At least KP is playing good D and his shot will eventually come which will provide some spacing. DP gives us nothing if he doesn't have a wide open dunk.
Playing behind Dwight Powell lol
"Man, Dwight Powell is fucking terrible"
Him sticking with Dwight Powell in the starting lineup has been bad and led to bad starts. But he has done a good job with adjustments to help get us back in games and close after slow starts in the last 3. So I guess we'll see if he changes that starting lineup soon.
"Brunson got them in this game,luka brought it home.Man i have nothing against Dwight Powell but i am so fucking pissed every time i see him on the court,why doesnt kid give a chance to the new kid Brown he cant be worst than Dwight he is not a guy for a starting line up,hell i wouldnt put him on a second unit,i dont know man,2 offensive fouls in last 5 minutes from him were Dwight special,but maybe its just me guys?"
Oh my god Dwight Powell wtf
Dwight Powell must have something on Cuban to even still be on the roster. This guy is an absolute garbage…
Dwight Powell is such a shitty player. The fact that he’s starting for us is insane….
dwight powell is our starting center and he has 1 rebound
i honestly think the mavs have about 2.5 NBA starting caliber players on their starting roster  dwight powell would probably not even make the bench of most NBA teams
Dwight Powell has to be the worst starter in the NBA
"Not arguing for either player but Trae has better rim running options than Luka (Collins and Capela vs a slightly washed Dwight Powell and KP), which gives him more options between choosing to pass back out to shooters or to lob it up to his roller. They're both top 5 passers, imo, but just wanted to add that bit of context as to why Trae may have more assists."
The Dwight Powell of Inside The NBA
"Dwight ""Norman"" Powell"
Whatever he gets tonight against WCS and Dwight Powell.
"Bertans, Aminu, Dwight Powell, DAJ but everyone know why he got that contract."
"Dwight Powell  3 year / $33,240,375 for a lot of 2 points 2 rebounds games with shit defense"
"Dwight powell is the true Offensive GOAT, not Joe Ingles who cheats with 3 pointers"
If ya defense is Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell yeah well. That says enough.
Is it true that dallas had a chance to sign randle but signed dwight powell instead?
"clippers fans: how's Boogie doing.  mavs fans: Dwight Powell, is he still playing good?"
The classic Dwight Powell pump fake: a dead indicator the possession has been wasted.
"Actually Dwight Powell said exactly this in the post-game interview with the Mavs crew. He was excited but ""not surprised at all because he makes shots like that in practice every single day"""
In the postgame interview with Dwight Powell he said he was excited but not surprised because Luka practices those shots all the time.
"Hello Mr. Dwight Powell, may I please buy you a remodeled kitchen?"
"Tell Dwight ""nobody"" Powell to suck a lemon."
It's a good number. He wanted 7 like he had in Madrid But Dwight Powell already had it so 77 was born.
"He was 7 in Europe, but it was taken on the Mavs by Dwight Powell when he got drafted."
Prime Dwight....Powell.
Prime Dwight Powell
"PG: Shai, Corey Joseph  SG: RJ, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SF: Wiggins, Dort, Dillon Brooks  PF: Olynk, Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles  C: TT, Khem Birch  7 of those guys play starter minutes. Even if say TT or Dwight Powell don't make it because they're deep in the playoffs, I have no doubt they can beat a Enes Kanter-less Turkey (likely without Ilyasova and Furkan as well) or Giannis-less Greece and no doubt they can beat China or Czech Republic..  With the Olympic games itself I think that team can legitimately get a medal.."
