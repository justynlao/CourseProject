"lmao alright. It's literally every 30 minutes, someone posts a thread about how Luka is overrated because we are 8-10, like we aren't dealing with injuries/COVID.  Have fun if your team ever gets COVID and Murray/Millsap/Porter etc... are all out for weeks, and instead of having any sort of rational thought, redditers just think your team sucks and that Nikola Jokic is horrible because he isn't winning more games with Vlatko Cancar, Monte Morris, Isaiah Hartenstein, and PJ Dozier as his starters."
I would consider trading Vlatko Cancar if they throw in couple of first round picks
"I am saying that 76ers are stacked with good players , stacked . Vlatko Cancar is playing significant minutes at Denver, you know who that is ?   I am saying that if Embiid doesnt play , 76 based on players taht they have do much better than Nuggets . 76 ers should be able to win without embiid, they have good enough team, Nuggets have Murray and no one else"
Thinking Vlatko fucking Cancar is better than KCP is up there in the top 5 most laughable takes Ive seen on /r/nba
Have you watched Hartenstein or Vlatko ever?   Both of those players aren’t playing well but they’re still far better players than fucking Cancar or Hartenstein. Jesus lol
Vlatko Cancar is definitely not better than any of the Lakers role players.
"&gt; Yes we’re talking about two rookies lmao plus another rookie in RJ Hampton , a g league level player in Vlatko Cancar and a foul machine in Hartenstein  I mean they’re better than the Lakers role players rn."
"Yes we’re talking about two rookies lmao plus another rookie in RJ Hampton , a g league level player in Vlatko Cancar and a foul machine in Hartenstein"
Yeah Vlatko Cancar is the best Slovenian player currently in a Western conference team
Vlatko Cancar was clearly the best player out there
"Campazzo, Nnaji, Hartenstein, Vlatko Cancar? Who is half of the Nuggets roster? I don't recognize all these dudes"
As if Vlatko Cancar isn't irrepressible
"[Vlatko cancar, put some respect on his name](https://i.imgur.com/T4xUDj4.jpg)  He’s a Slovenian we drafted a few years ago. Currently, he mostly fills the juancho role as our Jokic whisperer/bench hype guy."
Vlatko Cancar
I just looked up Vlatko Cancar and he probably has the least flattering Wikipedia pic ever
"Dear God, the Wolves let Marcus Howard and Vlatko Cancar go off against them. Jokic is Jokic"
"This should be huge, last game the Nuggets had to play Bol Bol, Vlatko Cancar, and Markus Howard meaningful minutes"
PJ Dozier   Vlatko Cancar  Austin Rivers
Bol Bol  Vlatko Cancar  Markus Howard
"To be fair, the Nugs were playing Vlatko Cancar, Bol Bol, Shaq Harrison, and Markus Howard all double digit minutes. That’s not a recipe for success."
"First one we choked super hard  This one is just a lot of shit we're dealing with, injuries, tiredness, etc. Just happy we could compete while giving guys like Vlatko Cancar, Bol Bol and Markus Howard significant minutes."
Do you even know who Vlatko Cancar and Markus Howard are? What roster lol
"Bro the nuggets were giving minutes to vlatko cancar, bol bol, and Markus Howard in the first quarter tonight.  Jokic was 29/7/6 on good efficiency. This was also a b2b. You know, those spots where all the other superstars in the league sit out and rest instead of playing."
"Yeah we're playing on a back to back and our 5th game in 7 nights with 6 out of the top 10 rotation players out, can't be mad at this loss, just completely out of gas. Shit we were playing Bol Bol Vlatko Cancar and Markus Howard against Kyrie KD lineups."
Needs a statue erected in Denver alongside Facundo Campazzo and Vlatko Cancar.
"Bol Bol, Paul Millsap, and Vlatko Cancar."
That first quarter Vlatko Cancar appearance was a surprise.
"Nuggets seem to get rid of all these dudes (Juancho, Gary), so Vlatko Cancar better watch the fuck out lol"
Vlatko Cancar.
"Vlatko Cancar - Jokic's support animal, I mean friend."
"Here's a good chunk of them hanging out during the bubble.   &gt;[Among the group was his Trail Blazers teammate Mario Hezonja, Goran Dragic of Miami Heat, Nikola Jokic and Vlatko Cancar of the Denver Nuggets, Luka Doncic and Boban Marjanovic of the Dallas Mavericks, Nikola Vucevic of the Orlando Magic and Ivica Zubac of the Los Angeles Clippers.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)  &gt;[Nurkic is from Bosnia, Zubac and Hezonja are from Croatia, Vucevic resides from Montenegro, Dragic, Doncic, Cancar all hail from Slovenia, and Marjanovic and Jokic grew up in Serbia.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)"
"lol I heard the 2nd best player on Slovenia rn behind Luka is ... *drumroll* Vlatko Cancar, and he rides the end of the bench for the Nuggets.  assuming Goran doesn't play."
With Dragic gone Denver garbage time enthusiast Vlatko Cancar is probably their second best player. Doesn't bode too well but we've seen Luka do crazier things
Vlatko Cancar
"Vlatko Cancar plays for the Denver Nuggets. They we have some good role players. Zoran Dragic (brother of Goran)-he played in the nba for a while (Miami, Phoenix) but had a ton of injuries in his career (he was always considered as the more talented brother), Klemen Prepelic (elite sniper from 3 point range), Jaka Blazic (plays really hard-was always one of my favorite players to watch), Gasper Vidmar-kind of traditional center, but quite mobile (something like Valanciunas). These are probably the best players. Nothing to crazy, but these guys won the Euro when nobody expected that from them."
Vlatko Cancar
"for anyone else reading this chain, just to show you how disconnected this dude is from reality, he doesn't consider 2:43 left in a game to be ""2 mins"" lmfao  &gt;2:43		Vlatko Cancar enters the game for Michael Porter Jr.	104 - 125	 2:43		Markus Howard enters the game for Monte Morris	104 - 125	 2:43		Shaquille Harrison enters the game for Nikola Jokic	104 - 125	 2:43		Zeke Nnaji enters the game for Aaron Gordon	104 - 125"
"You're a moron. Did you even watch the game? Jokic played 17 minutes. AG played 12 minutes. MPJ played 15 minutes.   They had Markus Howard play 32 minutes, Shaq Harrison play 21 minutes and fucking Vlatko Cancar (WHO?!) play 17 minutes. Do you genuinely think they were trying to win this game?"
"Vlatko Cancar plays under 7 mpg, Howard plays 5.5, and Campazzo is actually decent. Not to say that Jokic isn’t carrying, he’s my MVP pick too, but I think those three guys are horrible examples to make your point"
"You don't think carrying a squad that gives legitimate minutes to guys like (no disrespect) Shaq Harrison, Facu Campazzo, Markus Howard, and Vlatko Cancar to the 3 seed is carrying?  We lost our second best player, another starter in Barton, and our 6th man in Morris, not to mention Dozier who is one of our better defenders (ALL GUARDS) and we still kept winning, if that isn't carrying I'm not sure what is."
"When the players protested games last playoffs, that picture leaked of all the Balkan guys hanging out with Jokic and Nurkic laughing together. I believe this was also from that video of Vlatko Cancar asking ""Why we no just play basketball?"" and everyone else giving him the side eye."
Just play him in the 1st quarter to get his triple double while dropping dimes to randos like Markus Howard and Vlatko Cancar.
Time to play Vlatko Cancar 48 minutes tomorrow Nuggets
"so did Denver, I’m not sure what this guy is trying to say with the Nuggets “going in at full force” against the Pistons. Markus Howard and Vlatko Cancar started. lol."
"Both teams have all-time greats, buddy. Giannis isn't some god, he was stopped by Vlatko Cancar."
"I used players that were small kids when Yao started playing and that's why didn't mentioned Sun Yue, Yi Jianlian and Andris Biedrins. Slovenia had only Luka and Vlatko Cancar in this period if I didn't forget anyone."
All this to get bounced by Vlatko Cancar.
Robbed Vlatko Cancar.
"You mean budget Vlatko Cancar? Sorry, I am still riding the high from the Slovenia game."
Vlatko Cancar.
"Vlatko ""ice in my blood"" Cancar"
You mean Vlatko Cancar doing his thing
Is that Vlatko Cancar I just saw?
Vlatko Cancar plays for us. He's an end of the bench guy but got some more action this year with the injuries.
Vlatko Cancar plays for the nuggets
"Their only non Luka NBA player right now is vlatko cancar, so..."
Any player who is better than Vlatko Cancar is a superstar (AKA zero)
I heard CP3 fucking hates Vlatko Cancar.
Vlatko Cancar (Nuggets)
B2B2B DPOY and MVP candidate isn't random for having fans. If they were talking about Vlatko Cancar or something sure that would be a randomly worshiped player
"McClank will see less of the floor than Vlatko Cancar, if he isn't immediately thrown into the G-League..."
"Its not just language and knowing someone. Its culture, food, music, humor. It is harder to make new friends when so much is so different. Both the Nuggets and Mavs have coaches specifically for Joki/Doncic, and the Nuggets have kept Vlatko Cancar in part because of this (close regions, they workout together everyday). But those are superstars, already fringe players wont get that treatment and I totally understand guys being good enough to contribute in the NBA staying in Europe"
"Wild that you think Australia has an answer for the Slovenian god, Vlatko Cancar"
Prince for Vlatko Cancar.  MIN getting all DEN draft picks that can’t crack our rotation.
the real true slovenian superstar  VLATKO CANCAR BABY!
"Vlatko Cancar, more like Vlatko Canshoot"
"Okay, lemme explain why Spain doesn't have any chances against Slovenia:  Their best players are role player Ricky Rubio, who's their first scoring option which says alot, aged Pau and Marc who are already too old for this shit, Willy Hermanboobiez, whose defense is non-existent and Rudy Fernandez, who was out of NBA after 4 years. And worst of all they all don't fit each other, they defense is ok, but offense sucks too much, if your first option is Ricky Rubio.(Only scored 88 against Japan and 81 against Argentine).  Meanwhile Slovenia has MVP candidate Luka Doncic, who ain't even at his prime yet, and Vlatko Cancar, who's better offensive player than Rubio. Rest of the players are elite shooters who fit with Luka well, even more than in Dallas. They scored 118 against Argentine and 116 against Japan which says a lot about their offensive power. But their defense is so-so.  So it's basically Slovenia's offense vs Spain's defense. If Spain clamp Luka hard, they'll leave open their shooters, and if they'll have 1v1 defense, Luka will feast on ISOing.  IMO final score will be 102:90 in favour to Slovenia."
Yeah Vlatko Cancar is amazing
"If y’all are interested in Burke, he’d be a reasonable straight-up trade for Cancar. Vlatko is buried on your bench behind a bunch of similarly sized Fs while you’ll be very thin at G while Murray is out."
Nuggets listening to offers for Vlatko Cancar
Vlatko Cancar vs Yuta Watanabe
Nuggets legend Vlatko Cancar
Vlatko Cancar can probably be used to move up 1/2 a spot. Include Bol Bol and you might be looking at being able to move up to the 25th pick.
LMAO it's clearly Vlatko Cancar
They have the goat vlatko cancar though!
Who y'all want from us Philly?  One bol bol?  One will the thrill in a s&amp;t?  One Vlatko Cancar?
"No idea why you are being downvoted. I don’t think people realize that this is Slovenia’s first time making the olympics in basketball. Luka and Vlatko Cancar are the only two players who are currently in the NBA, most other teams that qualified have around 5 or more. If Slovenia wins gold, whether they beat team USA or not, would be an outstanding accomplishment."
Vlatko Cancar
Vlatko Cancar the GOAT Stays focused on his game not these ig thots
Vlatko Cancar: 😞
"What’s your point? I watch the Nuggets all the time. Their bench is horrible. Nnaji and Cancar do nothing. Bol Bol will make mistakes for sure, but so will those guys and, at least, Bol Bol brings energy and brings the crowd into a frenzy. He actually does have talent even if he may not look like it. Certainly more than Caleb, KZ, Zeke or Vlatko. Not sure why you are spouting off about things you don’t know about."
"I understand everything you’re saying, but given he was always skinny and there wasn’t much opportunity for his frame to put on mass (given what we saw from Manute), I’m unsure why the Nuggets would take that flyer on him. He was always going to be skinny as all hell.   He likes to play on the perimeter for sure, but that isn’t uncommon for a lot of bugs nowadays. It seems like you could bring him into games where the team is listless and hope for a few blocks to get the crowd into it? What do Zeke Nnaji and Vlatko Cancar bring to the table? They’re both above him in the depth chart."
"I am glad you asked! [Vlatko](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/videos/_/id/4230557/vlatko-cancar) doesn’t get many minutes, but he is second behind Bol Bol in my heart."
