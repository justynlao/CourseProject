"Orlando's frontcourt is hurting right now. Giving James Ennis, Gary Clark and Dwayne Bacon big minutes."
"Lots of their ""scorers"" have been or still are out so that Vucevic and Ross are left as the only consistent offensive threats over like half the games this year. That causes role players like Clark, Ennis and co to be forced into roles to big for them. Also doesn't help that rookie Cole Anthony and Dwayne Bacon are your backcourt duo"
"oh, Dwayne Bacon..."
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
Change Dwayne Bacon to Christian Wood
"Rudy Gay, Derrick White, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Love, Dwayne Bacon"
Dwayne bacon is on his way out the league.
"Dwayne bacon ain’t shit. DLo wasn’t even the snitch. He filmed someone and then someone else uploaded it. Also if Nick young didn’t want to get filmed being a douche bag, he shouldn’t have been a douche bag.   DLo was just talking trash and Saunders fucked our game up. No reason for Bacon to make up some bullshit."
"&gt;	Dwayne Bacon  I believe that’s NBA pork, actually"
"The guy who scored 4 points today?   Funny thing is Dlo actually didn't snitch...his account was hacked.   If I were Dwayne Bacon I'd focus on improving my game, otherwise he could be serving people bacon and eggs at the local IHOP soon."
Who’s Dwayne Bacon?
"Anthony has looked pretty solid (even putting tonight's game-winner aside). His stats aren't necessarily the prettiest - he had some shooting issues early in the season, but dished out a suprising amount of assists - but he's got good instincts/hustle, and he passes the ""eye test"" 100%.  Dwayne Bacon has also looked pretty good at times, even getting some starting minutes during our recent injury travails, but he's still really raw. Definitely not afraid to shoot it, that's for sure."
I hate some of Cliffs rotations and may want him gone in fits of anger but he is a solid coach with equity in the organization.  Recently the way he’s pushing Vuc and Gordon has earned my respect because he finally realized that Dwayne Bacon and Gary Clark just suck.
I thought Dwayne Bacon was on the Magic now?
"&gt; You mean the first game after a huge trade things weren't super tight?  ""Top two players in the East"" [who've been teammates for years before] can't ruin a bottom-feeding East team without their best defender?   I didn't say ""totally different"" - I said if one player was back for Orlando. They literally started Anthony [not a scrub but a young rookie], Dwayne Bacon, and James Ennis, lol. And they stuck with the ""#1 and #2"" players in the East, according to the post I replied to. Bacon is a 3rd stringer for most teams. Ennis is a bench player, Anthony is a bench player.   It was essentially KD+Harden vs Vucevic and Gordon, and they struggled to put them away.   But yeah, ""really impressive"" showing there. /s"
Well I should he shocked Dwayne Bacon didn't pass but I've watched him all season.
Another Dwayne Bacon possession where he didn't even think of passing the ball FML.
I wonder how many assists Dwayne Bacon will have at the end of the year.  He passes so little for someone whose so mediocre offensively.  His best asset is he doesn't turn the ball over.
I'm gonna consider being down 2 points at the half the actual won for us.  All I want to do is come out of this game emotionally not scarred by Jordan Bone and Dwayne Bacon.  Gary Clark made a three so he's in my good graces this game.
Have I mentioned how much I hate Dwayne Bacon.  That brother hasn't seen a shot he's not willing to take.
"More entertaining than the other way around, at least.  Dwayne Bacon kinda moves like a PF at times for us"

"Here you go:   &gt; Dort is morphing from curiosity to basketball player. He has hit 44% of his ceiling-scraping 3s on decent volume -- about 6.5 attempts per 36 minutes -- even though the shot flies so high, the atmosphere might alter its trajectory. He has a bulldozing pump-and-go game, and a surprising ability to decelerate.   &gt;Dort is averaging about 12 drives per 100 possessions, up from eight last season, per Second Spectrum. A cautionary note: Oklahoma City has scored a paltry 0.714 points per possession when Dort shoots out of a drive or dishes to a teammate who fires -- 178th out of 190 players who have recorded at least 20 drives.  &gt; Dort is wild and turnover prone. He has zero midrange game; he is 1-of-10 on shots from between the restricted area and the 3-point arc. Still: it's encouraging to see him stretch himself.  &gt; He remains a growling brick wall on defense. His motor is incredible, and occasionally a little disconcerting.  &gt; Nine guys are playing basketball there. Dort is playing his own game, scrambling around as if someone has challenged him to guard an entire team at once. He denies Evan Fournier an open 3, rides Fournier's hip into the lane, and slashes outside to fly at Dwayne Bacon. He then drifts right to deter a potential pass to Aaron Gordon in the corner, and finally U-turns out to deflect that kickout to Fournier.  &gt; I'm tired just watching that. It looks like someone is controlling Dort with a remote control.  &gt; In conclusion: MAKE THE DORT MINI-LICENSE PLATES!!"
And Mo Bamba for Dwayne fucking Bacon lmao what is this
i picked Dwayne Bacon up in fantasy because I knew he was gonna get minutes and we're lacking two of our better defenders tonight. hes really just a body out there lol
"I’m known to be a hater of his and I don’t deny that.  I think he is who he is.  He’s a lot of different volume scorers with a high usage rate and a green light.  Think, a really expensive Dion Waiters or Dwayne Bacon haha"
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
"Well when the Centers above him in rotation are injured Okafor kicks ass. Dante Exum had injuries, Emmanuel Mudiay sat on Utah’s bench last year and did alright, Stanley Johnson is stealing minutes from Matt Thomas on my Raptors, Justise Winslow played like 7 games last season (I think), Dragan Bender turned out to only be a baby Dragan, Kris Dunn has a worse jumper then Stevie Wonder, Thon Maker realized he was ass and kept a connection to that by making Thongs, Skal Labissiere is still trying to learn how to spell his name, Josh Jackson’s doing alright on the Pistons this year Phoenix was pretty impatient with his effiency and consistency, Frank Ntilikina is the god and you will not besmirch his name, Dennis Smith Jr got traded to the Knicks where player development comes to die, TJ Leaf never turned over a new leaf, Dwayne Bacon burned his foot on a George Foreman grill cooking himself, Marvin Bagley gets injured more then I get rejected (a lot), Mo Bamba is hardly playing this season, Zhaire Smith is Zhaire Smith and Mo Wagner is existing"
Dwayne Bacon had a hype train?
i'm not even gonna try and guess where some of these guys are. I do know however that Dwayne Bacon has a solid role in Orlando and should be expanded with the Fultz injury
Oh certainly just look at our forward rotation.  Aaron Gordon is the only competent one on the roster.  If we can get a better SF and maybe a stretch 4 off the bench preferably not Dwayne Bacon and Gary Clarke we’d be better off.

i'm all aboard the terrence ross hype train.  he plays starter minutes since the starting sg is dwayne bacon.
Not to mention if the suns get Dwayne Bacon their roster could be Chris P Bacon
"For starters, Vuc's defense is a lot better than Trae's -- iirc, Trae is one of the worst defenders (if not the worst) in the NBA.  And frankly, the levels of talent are not even close to being similar.    Trae and Vuc lead both their teams with 3.7 win shares each.  The Hawks then have Capela with 3.2/28 games, Collins with 3.0/31 games.  The player with the second most win shares on the Magic is...Khem Birch, a former journeyman and backup C, who has 2.1/32 games.  So Trae's next two best players are both a full standard deviation or so better than Vuc's second best.    The lineup that has played the most minutes for the Hawks (194 minutes, this will be important later) this year is Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela.  So along with Trae, you have a 20/10 guy in Collins, a 15/14 lob threat with Capela, and solid shooting from Huerter (38% from 3 on 6 attempts a game) and defense from Reddish.  The lineup that has played the most minutes for the Magic this year is Cole/Ennis/Fournier/Gordon/Vuc.  They have played 70 minutes together compared to Hawks 194, or \~60% less, because injuries have taken out most of the lineup at one point or another (note, we're not even counting Fultz/Isaac who are just out for the season).  This lineup has a rookie PG shooting 37% from the field (Cole), a player we traded the 58th pick in the draft for (Ennis), and then solid starters in Fournier/Gordon.  The problem is both Fournier/Gordon have been out this season for \~40% of the games (19/32 GP for AG, 18/32 GP for Fournier).  While the Hawks 2nd most used lineup has played \~100 minutes less than their most used lineup, the Magic's 2nd most used lineup has played \~12 minutes less (again, owing to injury), and this lineup subs out Fournier for Dwayne Bacon who is shooting a whopping 41% FG and averages &lt;1 assist per game.  All this is to say -- Trae is surrounded by much better talent this season, and it isn't particularly close.  Also, let's pretend everything I just said was wrong -- why should Sabonis have made it over Trae?"
"&gt; Pacers have 47 missed games from their starters  ORL has missed 80 games from their starters.  &gt; Aaron holiday whose their 6th man misses several games too  Holiday has been healthy all year (29/29 GP), you're probably thinking of Jeremy Lamb.   Still nowhere close to the MASH unit down in ORL, where they've had to start Dwayne Bacon 20 times."
"Coaches aren't gonna punish Vooch for being forced to start alongside MCW, Dwayne Bacon, James Ennis, and Gary Clark lol. Due to injuries we have had legitimately the worst SG, SF, and PFs in the league for a plurality of the season"
"Vooch shouldn't be punished for playing for the most injured team (by a large margin) lmao he's had to start numerous games next to Gary Clark, James Ennis III, and Dwayne Bacon"
Dwayne Bacon?
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."

"It's complicated because to be honest, we're not a bad team on paper when healthy. The reason we always seem to get off to a hot start and then suddenly cool off is because all of a sudden our rotation gets decimated. We've just had shit luck in regards to freak injuries for like 4 years now, but I genuinely believe that we're one elite scorer from being a team that could make a lot of noise in the playoffs when healthy sort of like the Bubble Heat. Assuming Fournier leaves this year via trade or free agency, a healthy Magic team has (guaranteed) Fultz, Isaac, Gordon, and Vucevic as starters, with Cole Anthony, Terrance Ross, Chuma Okeke, and Al-Farouq Aminu off the bench. That's a pretty good core, but obviously right now we're running MCW, Gary Clark, Dwayne Bacon and James Ennis. If we could get that elite scorer, we would be idiots to trade players like Vucevic and Gordon to tank.  You also have to remember that Orlando isn't gonna pull many big names through trades or free agency any time soon, as we haven't had any real success in a decade. Pretty much any offer we get for Vucevic would be a bad trade on our part for us. Unfortunately for Celtics fans, we're not trading Vuc for Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and a couple seconds.  Finally, right now the East is too wide open to tank. While Fultz and Isaac are gone, Gordon and Anthony should return, and Steve Clifford and our FO wouldn't commit to tanking unless we had no shot at the playoffs, and we're only a couple games out."
"That's not how names work. If anything it would be Dwayne ""Don't Call Me Wayne"" Bacon."
"dwayne ""the bacon"" wayne"
Dwayne Bacon trick y'all man
I think you're really underrating the value of talent.  The guy who led the worst g league team in field goal attempts last year was 6th on his team in scoring in college. Dwayne Bacon is a below replacement level NBA player and turns into a 30ppg scorer in the G-league.
"Orlando running an 8 man rotation of Vucevic, Terrence Ross, Michael Carter-Williams, Mo Bamba, Dwayne Bacon, Gary Clark, Chuma Okeke, and Khem Birch..."
Dwayne Bacon watches the whole arc to finale then sluffs it off.  Excellent.
"We are already the worst shooting team in the league, and we were forced to play lineups of two centers, two power forwards, and a shooting guard, that’s the point.  Having Draymond fill in at guarding the center position is a whole lot easier than asking Terrence Ross, Dwayne Bacon, James Ennis, and Khem Birch to initiate and run your offense.   And that’s not even considering asking centers to match up on small forwards and small forwards to match up on Curry."
"That Draymond at center with Steph, Wiggins, and oubre is not as disadvantageous as Dwayne Bacon at point guard with Vucevic, James Ennis, and Ross.   That's the point."
Dwayne bacon is my second favorite starter tonight. What has life come to
Magic fan: My team subs in Dwayne Bacon.
We have Dwayne Bacon who still hasn’t found the x button yet on his controller.
Dwayne Bacon
If you swap Booker for Dwayne Bacon they 100% loose this game. If you swap Ayton for Tony Bradley I’m not so sure
Dwayne Bacon but once Gary Harris gets back he will probably start.
MCW and Dwayne Bacon when he gets the ball
"Theo Maledon, Dwayne Bacon, Isaac Okoro, Darius Bazley, Aron Baynes"
Dwayne bacon average 10 ppg on 49% true shooting lol
Wym? Dwayne Bacon is the both the only reason they win the games they do and one of the many reasons they lose so many.
We got Kelly Oubre at home  *points at Dwayne Bacon*
Shoutout to Dwayne Bacon
"If I look at the other angles, there are two fouls: 1 from Dwayne Bacon and 1 from Wendell Carter Jr.  [https://streamable.com/2ejf60](https://streamable.com/2ejf60)  [https://streamable.com/qsxh3r](https://streamable.com/qsxh3r)"
Dwayne Bacon the nicest in the league
Dwayne Bacon
"I don’t think we suck at tanking.  The other teams playing either suck or aren’t trying hard enough.  I guess we could play Dwayne Bacon and Mo Bamba (who had a decent game) more, but if you don’t expect guys on our team to try than your gonna be disappointed.  It’s their job to win games and not lose.  You can say Cliff is doing too good of a job coaching but outside of playing Dwayne Bacon and Mo Bamba more I legit don’t know what else he can do.  He’s literally playing with the hands that he’s dealt with."
"Dwayne Bacon, Terrance Ross and Cole Anthony hydra really feeling disrespected right now"
New Lotto odds hopefully goes in our favor but I’m not gonna be mad because like I said if we want to lose all Cliff has to do is play Dwayne Bacon and Mo Bamba more.  Plus don’t shocked to see T Ross and Birch rested near the end of the season to prevent injury so they can be traded in the off season.
I feel sad for the other 28 fanbases that don't know the joys of Dwayne Bacon
Yeah but he’s the type of coach a young team needs.  Last thing guys need is a losing mentality in their ear.  Plus a win like this breeds confidence for next year.  It’s easy for us to lose games honestly all we have to do is play Dwayne Bacon and Mo Bamba big minutes.  Simple adjustments.  To be fair however Mo was better than Khem this game.
Outside of Carter I don’t see anybody on our bench who is starting.    Ross is a bench guy and RJ is a bench guy.  Maybe Otto but frankly James Ennis might be better.  Now if we talking starting over Dwayne Bacon and banishing him to the shadow realm that’s a different story.
MCW giveth and MCW taketh.  Live by the MCW die by the MCW.  Chuma is a stud Wendell is a stud (seriously stop wasting our time and give him all of Mo Bamba’s minutes). Best of all with Terrence Ross back no more tank commander Dwayne Bacon.  Actually is that a good thing.  Idk just glad we won a game.
You played the Magic who’s top option was Dwayne Bacon and the Cavs who’s top option was Darius Garland.......

Dwayne Bacon has a constant green light in Dwayne Bacons mind
"I'd really like to see what he's got as an initiator more, instead of watching Dwayne Bacon shooting the ball on no pass possessions lol"
I like to call Dwayne Bacon “We have Terrence Ross at home”
Can't believe I just witnessed Dwayne Bacon at PG to close a game - that was close.
They let Dwayne Bacon score 26 lmao
Is Dwayne Bacon aware that he can pass the ball
One game in and Bulls fans are already wrong about Wendell Carters defense.  The guy is mobile and can switch on the perimeter plus he protects the rim without fouling.  It’s clear to me that his poor play had more to do with poor coaching in Chicago because he was easily our best center and outplaying Khem Birch in Cliffs eyes isn’t easy and he earned every minute.  Dwayne Bacon and the surprise stealth tank of Otto Porter was pretty interesting.  Otto had no interest in defense but he sure did love jacking up threes.
"Francis, Kevin, and now Dwayne. Keeping the Bacon name strong."
can i start the dwayne bacon fan club or does one already exist
Yep Dwayne Bacon.
Dwayne bacon is an awesome name
Scared of dwayne bacon
Dwayne Bacon?
Is Dwayne Bacon about to be playing overseas bad or just role player coming off the bench bad?
Dwayne Bacon beats them 1 on 5
"Saw a comment on r/Magic that made me laugh.   ""Dwayne Bacon has never seen a shot he didn't like.""  Seriously.  This guy has all the moves.  Pull ups, floaters, deep threes. Euro steps.  Step backs.  He can miss it all."
"Dwayne Bacon, you are not allowed to be that bad with a name that great.    Sacrilege"
Dwayne Bacon wants to shine and we want to lose. It’s a win-win for everyone involved and I get a few laughs. Can’t be too mad at that.
It's such an underrated part of his game. No he's not Jokic but he's improved his passing *significantly*. Problem is he's throwing all his passes to guys like Dwayne Bacon and Gary Clark Jr.
Dwayne Bacon took his own team out back
When you’re primary defender on you is Dwayne bacon you can do these things
Dwayne Bacon is THE tank commander
Dont know how dwayne bacon is in the NBA. He sucks.
Dwayne Bacon Tank Commander of the night. Should lose playing time for that boneheaded prayer with lots of time left.
"I said it last game against the magic, but after that shot i'll say it again, i don't think Dwayne Bacon has ever even thought about passing the ball."
"Vucevic last 4 seasons is 70% at the rim and 50% in the paint non restricted area, and now he's 40% from three lmfao he's so fucking good  who the fuck does terrence ross think he is taking that weird ass shot   also, who the fuck does dwayne bacon think he is taking that that weird ass shot"
Tank Commander Dwayne Bacon
Only Dwayne Bacon would see 3 defenders ahead of him and just rush down the middle anyways
"For some reason I thought it was miles and Dwayne bacon that stayed with him in Florida, which seemed so much more bizarre haha"
If you told me Dwayne Bacon has never passed the ball in his career i would believe you.
Just stop.  Aaron Gordon took huge strides this years as a playmaker and his defense has always been elite.  If anything Isaac has been overrated by everyone until he suddenly became this great offensive player in the bubble.  And Markelle improved big time this year.  We just lack consistent shooting. We really need to load up on shooters instead of pure dense types or whatever it is that Dwayne Bacon does.
Dwayne Bacon
Dwayne Bacon is a great tank commander
I can’t imagine they care that much about what Dwayne Bacon had to say like 4 months ago
lmao who the hell is Dwayne Bacon
Dwayne Bacon in shambles
"I’m just confused on why this team full of role players and 10 days who need this time to stay in the league, simply refuse to drive and draw contact. The only person who attempts it is Dwayne Bacon and he can’t buy a call."

Dwayne Bacon. Solid tank commander tho
Dwayne Bacon
Dwayne Bacon
Listen Dwayne Bacon is absolute trash.  He shoots teams out of the games and rarely passes.  Give me Charlie Brown jr who does nothing over a garbage player who thinks he’s Kobe any day of the week.
And we’ve played a Dwayne Bacon.
"I came across him in 2k and his offensive stats are all in the low 70's and I was thinking how could they really create the dwayne bacon experience in 2k with the ratings accurately.    I think the best way would honestly be to give him mid-late 60's on layups, mid ranges and 3 and then give him a shit ton of bronze badges.  Oh and gold 'volume shooter'"

Counterpoint: Dwayne Bacon
I officially submit Dwayne Bacon for MVP considerations
"Yeah, but Dwayne Bacon hasn't missed a single game this year.  So whose the real winner here?"
"@joshuabrobbins: The Magic will start Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Dwayne Bacon, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba tonight against the Pelicans in Orlando. Wendell Carter Jr., Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis, Otto Porter Jr. and Terrence Ross will not play."
So have Dwayne Bacon and you don't see me bragging about that fact.

Dwayne Bacon is quite the tank commander
"I see his VORP as 0.7 which actually ranks him in the top 113 out of 524 total players.  Anthony Edwards ranks 519 out of 524 which is interesting. The only players below him are Sekou Doumbouya, Isaac Okoro, Dwayne Bacon, Rodney Hood, and Theo Maledon."
"This is hilarious, as a hornets fan I feel you on the injury front but also Dwayne Bacon. How has he been for yall this year?"
Are you saying Dwayne Bacon is a cockroach?
"Laughs in Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, MCW, James Ennis, Mo Bamba, Terrence Ross, Otto Porter JR (I don’t even remember when he got hurt), and pretty much anyone not named Dwayne freaking Bacon.  Dwayne Bacon can survive a nuclear catastrophe unscathed.  That man will not get hurt or sick,  he’s the true iron man of the NBA."
"A few spots above him on that list is Dwayne Bacon. That’s my pick for worst player getting 20+ minutes. He’s a SG who can’t shoot or defend, and doesn’t pass the ball.  His passing is a running joke on the Celtics radio broadcast every time we play him. Max hates him for some reason."
Dwayne bacon is prolly the worst player to have a decent sized role on an nba team
Our sub has Dwayne Bacon
"Some nights it’s automatic, some nights he looks like Dwayne Bacon"
I put him in the KD/Dwayne Bacon tier
They can have Dwayne Bacon and Gary Harris
My favorite is when Ian Eagle calls Magic games because he just unloads all of his Bacon puns whenever Dwayne Bacon plays
&gt; And honestly I can't explain Dwayne Bacon. Every coach has that one player.  You're right. Every coach seems to have that one player. It's quite comical.
"Nah, Dwayne Bacon is our official tank commander"
"He played Ennis and MCW because they were better players.  Period end of story.  Isaac didn't get plays for him because Isaac isn't a first, second or third option on offense.  I guarantee you Isaac is better off having been just the defensive anchor of our team because when he does get a bigger role he will know how to still fit in a team scheme and contribute if things aren't going his way.  Vuc was a really poor defensive player before Cliff.  Under Cliff we managed a top 10 defense with Vuc because Cliff knows how to put a player in a position to succeed when they have limitations.  Eventually RJ earned his minutes so I see no fault in that.  And honestly I can't explain Dwayne Bacon.  Every coach has that one player."
"Dude after the trade deadline he continued to start and play MCW, Dwayne Bacon, and James Ennis III more minutes than Anthony, Hampton, and Okeke until MCW went down with injury. Isaac barely got any touches or plays run for him. Vuc put up 19/11 under Jacque Vaughn so I’m not sure Cliff gets credit for him getting a little better.      The guy has no patience with young players. He would play vets every single game to squeeze out extra Ws if he could, which is diametrically opposed to the process of letting young players work through their mistakes even though it some times leads to losses."
"I was actually just dicking around trying to think of someone at 4 or 5 they could trade for CJ. Is Hachimuras defense good? I havent really seen him play but I love him for 1st fg bets. He's probably too young for Dame tho. Would Washington make that trade? Cj Beal, Russ. Pj Washington? How about... Miles Turner? Indy gets a SG to pair with Sabonis and Portland gets a 25 year old big. Idk... Dwayne Bacon and Wendell Carter Jr, then Orlando can flip CJ for picks? Do they play defense? Theres some depth, 2 decent players. I dont get to watch a ton of games so im really not sure who are great defenders at the 4 or 5. Except the obvious guys. I know who's good on offense m, but not so much defense. Anunoby?"
Worst list I've ever seen. Lebron should be higher than Dwayne Bacon and Biyombo is too high.
1. Stanley Johnson  2. Theo Maledon  3. Bismack Biyombo  4. Darius Bazley  5. Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk  6. Aleksej Pokusevski  7. Dwayne Bacon  8. Cole Anthony  9. LeBron James  10. Isaac Okoro

Dwayne the shart bacon to me is the winner
How the fuck do you put Dwayne Bacon but not that menace Gary Clark
Big ups Dwayne Bacon who played at least 15 minutes of every game except 1
He just has an odd love affair with Dwayne Bacon.
"538's RAPTOR ranks Biyombo as the 8th worst player this year (who played more than 1000minutes), with the 10th worst WAR, the ones worse than him being rookies and young guys (and Dwayne Bacon)."
"Following the same criteria (no rookies, no injuries, starter-like minutes), 538 Raptor has:  Lonnie Walker IV -2.3 WAR  P.J. Tucker/ Dwayne Bacon -1.8 WAR  Bismack Biyomobo -1.4 WAR  Stanley Johnson -0.8 WAR"
"I just wanna say this: Dwayne Bacon never showed promise in CLT. He showed the promise to be a bad shot taker at a inefficient rate, but never any promise in defense, playmaking, and shooting at a high level.   I mean he shot 40% from 3 for a season and then decided next season he was fucking Kobe and started taking midrange pull-ups he had no business A) taking and B) making. It was a pain to watch him, and I’m glad Clifford took him off of our hands."
6 degrees of Dwayne Bacon
"Did you also consider ""Six Degrees of Dwayne Bacon""?"
Dwayne Bacon and Kirk Hinrich have both had Marvin Williams as teammates.
Dwayne Bacon
"I really feels like this Orlando season was a success minus the injuries of Fultz and Isaac and way too much Dwayne Bacon.  WCJ looked decent, the two young guards look great, Okeke showed some stuff. Now comes the hard part : can the FO be patient and disciplined enough, and what happens if it turns out Fultz isn't the best guard prospect on that team"
"I remember people on the Hornets sub siding with him about the coaching staff not giving him a fair shake after sending him down to G League Purgatory.  We freaking started him at the beginning of the season.  Some fans just never learn.  And neither does Dwayne Bacon, because he played just like this as a Rookie."
Dwayne Bacon is our only player to play every game this season.
if my boy Dwayne Bacon goes 102 from 102 from the field (39/39 from 3) and 98/98 from the line he'll also get there. Seems pretty likely to me

Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
Dwayne Bacon. Dude is allergic to passing the ball and has the shot selection of Kobe without any of the skill
Tatum to Orlando for Dwayne Bacon
The disrespect to Dwayne Bacon
He's no Dwayne Bacon.
"Some of y’all are weird because what the fuck does half of that comment even mean    1) “AG is no saint”— wasn’t even even defending AG, but when you get injured to the point of missing the rest of the play in games and playoffs, a game after a teammate tore his ACL, you’re not going to be the most forgiving person out here.   2) Something something AG MCW bad, Kyle Lowry goat— I don’t give a shit about Kyle Lowry being better than those two, I’d be pissed as a Magic fan if he fucking injured Dwayne Bacon.  I’d be a shitty fan if I didn’t."

Orlando Magic starting lineup:  Cole Anthony -  Gary Harris -  Dwayne Bacon - Moritz Wagner - Mo Bamba   Team Serbia starting lineup:  Stefan Jović - Bogdan Bogdanović - Nemanja Bjelica - Nikola Jokić - Boban Marjanović  Why exactly do people think Orlando could beat Serbia?
We’ll take him for another useless guard and a second like Fultz. Perhaps Dwayne Bacon?

Payton is way better than Dwayne Bacon.  You dont notice when Payton ia on the court half the time.  You always notice Dwayne Bacon because he makes himself to center of attention.
Dwayne Bacon
Six Degrees of Dwayne Bacon
I promise you he is nothing like PJ Tucker. For starters he can’t be a small ball center.  He can’t even play PF. He has no defensive versatility.  He shoots on every possession and thinks he’s Kobe.  Lacks the ability to pass. Can barely make spot up threes and trust me teams gave us a lot of open shots.  Doesn’t pass.  Has great foot work but can’t do anything with it.  Sucks on defense unless he’s guarding someone his exact same size who is slower than him.  Can’t pass.  And whenever he is in he has the mindset that it’s Dwayne Bacon time.  Really he’s the perfect tank commander.  Also did I mention he doesn’t pass.  That’s really important because he never passes the ball.
Dwayne Bacon&gt;Dwayne wade
Dwayne Bacon is already a rap name lol its great
"I went to fsu basketball camps a few years ago and Dwayne bacon was one of the people there, he would play around and freestyle in the mornings but I have no idea he had legit songs 😭"
Y’all heard that Dwayne Bacon? Wym you have no idea who Dwayne Bacon is? It’s fire bro trust me.
Dwayne Bacon and a 2nd round pick. Final offer.
"I don't really see how this is relevant. My point is that at his prime he was good enough to be a starter in weaker team if given the minutes and a slot to do so. Obviously that's not what happened, but given that he's performed similarly or better to some of the weaker NBA starters when playing against or even with them I don't really see  how it's that he ""absolutely"" wouldn't have been good enough rather than that situations/fit didn't align in time.  Even if we are discussing whether or not he could have been starter at the time he played in the league, we'd have the issue that he never really went to a weak team.   I mean how much better do you think players like Delon Wright, Josh Jackson, Jae'Sean Tate, Dwayne Bacon, or Cole Anthony for example are than what Nando DeColo is now or at his best?  Or you can take those guys I mentioned, do you think they would have started in Spurs or Toronto at that time? Hell, I'm not even sure if someone like Rubio or Bledsoe would have."
dwayne bacon and miles bridges better      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UglwiO1Cvqs

Wait is he better or worse than Dwayne Bacon.  That'll determine my interest.
Orlando has Dwayne Bacon. He’s a pretty damn good tank commander
Dwayne bacon is first team all NBA in my book
"They got Dwayne Bacon, Oak Hill star they going 82-0"
"&gt; Then the last two spots probably go to veteran mentors.   Maybe we can get someone cheap who won’t need minutes, someone like Dwayne bacon?"
"They have so many guards now. Suggs, Hampton, Cole, Gary Harris, Terrence Ross, MCW, Dwayne Bacon. I suppose the last four aren't really a part of their future though."
There are a few tough ones. I actually considered Dwayne Bacon lol

"Imagine if Mitchell said get me out of here right now and they traded him for Kevin Knox,Dwayne Bacon, Taj Gibson, and 2 first round picks  That’s the Vince Carter trade"
"This sounds like it was written by Steve Clifford.       The guy started veterans James Ennis, Dwayne Bacon, Chasson Randle, and Khem Birch after the trade deadline when it was clear the Magic were trying to develop their young guys. It led to a meaningless win over the Pelicans, like many other meaningless late season Magic wins that have hurt their/your lottery odds and led to worse draft picks.      Your best prospect in years was Jonathan Isaac and didn’t even average 10 FGA/game by this third season under Clifford. MCW is atrocious lol. Gordon was so consistently underwhelming I have no idea how you could type that “he looked so good”… the Nuggets gave up a recent 24th pick in Hampton and a protected first rounder five years away, as well as the corpse of Gary Harris.       Clifford has preferred playing vets to developing young players his entire head coaching career. To suggest otherwise is true revisionist history."
Dwayne Bacon  Shake Milton  Devin Booker
"I totally get not being interested in Murray. There are teams I think he’s a good fit for and there are some like the 76ers where I think he’d be an awful fit. Though I’m not sure how good he is as a halfcourt facilitator so that could change my mind.  My sense is he’s a below average 3 point shooter and an incredibly inefficient scorer overall. His 50.9% ts this year tied with Russ’ for 180th highest of the 189 guys who played enough to qualify for the bballref leaderboard. Only ones with a worse ts% were Aaron Holiday, John Wall, Cole Anthony, Darius Bazley, Dwayne Bacon, Theo Maledon, Cedi Osman, and Elfrid Payton. His ts% was highest in the 2020 season and it was still only 52.4% I do know he’s a way better midrange shooter as well as a better shooter from the line and further from the basket than Simmons.  Brogdon’s a different story in my opinion. And I’m not even all that high on him but I think he’d work better for you guys than Simmons does. And there’s a fair few other guys I’d say the same about even if they’re not as good players in a vacuum."
"Damn, Dwayne Bacon catching strays"
"Most of these names are very normal considering where the players come from, like wtf is wrong with “josh giddey” and how is it worse than a name like Dwayne bacon"
Dwayne Bacon. Showed some upside at the end of his second season which gave me hope but it was short lived. Steve Clifford loved him though
Dwayne Bacon snickers from the bench
"I'm an FSU alum, and boy did we love Terence Mann. He came in with a class of highly ranked players (Malik Beasley and Dwayne Bacon), and while they left early to go to the NBA, he stayed all 4 years and became a true leader on our team. I remember when he left there were people even suggesting we retire his number."
Ahem.  Dwayne Bacon
oubre and dwayne bacon
"Weird take considering they're healthy, Lamelo is a year more experienced, Bridges looks like a beast and Hayward is one of the best #3 contributors in basketball right now...  But yes, it must be the marginal improvement of Oubre playing over the likes of Dwayne Bacon, MKG, the Martin bros, and Marvin Williams lmaooo"
that jeremy lamb over glen rice with dwayne bacon story made me slightly uncomfortable
