Jordan Clarkson is Asian American
"jordan clarkson was in the club up until recently, now he’s at 46/38/97"
Jordan clarkson was until that last couple games
Imma show my kid Jordan Clarkson highlights and tell him that's Michael Jordan.
Someone said FVV is a glorified Jordan Clarkson and the replies were mostly how he outplayed Steph in the finals   Maybe he saw that thread.
"Yeah by Jordan Clarkson, we mean John Collins right"
From a completely unbiased perspective it is clearly Jordan Clarkson
Conveniently leaves out Kevin Love as well as spark plugs like Jordan Clarkson Rodney Hood and veteran shooters like Kyle Korver and George Hill.  the toughest teams he faced where the pacers who somehow took them to 7 (lol) and Celtics led by rookie jayson tatum. I think KD would do just fine lol
"For sure, he was my favorite prospect going into that draft. Given the opportunity, I can see him succeeding in a roll like Jordan Clarkson has carved out this season with the Jazz, being a guy whose focused on getting buckets every time he’s on the floor."
"Conley isn't the same player he was last year, he's much more adjusted to the offense and his role. He looks like the Mike Conley we wanted to trade for in the first place  Bogdanovic is back and finally rolling coming back from wrist surgery, which held him out in the playoffs. He was a 20 PPG scorer last year  Favors has returned and looks great, especially defensively. He's been a big reason as to why our bench unit is so much more successful than last year when we were throwing out Tony Bradley and the corpse of Ed Davis whenever Gobert was sitting or injured  Royce O'Neale keeps steadily improving  Jordan Clarkson looks even better than he did for us last season after we traded for him"
Thought Jordan Clarkson was an unnecessary overpay.
"It's possible that Embiid will be the only first round pick from the draft to make an All-Star team.   Good second round though: Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Dwight Powell (who was pretty good before his Achilles injury), Jordan Clarkson."
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
"Yeah, but a lot of times it's a weight issue as well.  If Boban had this injury there'd be more complications because he's closer to 300 pounds so there's a lot more stress. The Slim Reaper is going to have more problems than say Jordan Clarkson because of the height, but his build being so lean is going to allow him to recover better than other players of his height."
Haha Mike Conley washed  Bojan Bogdanovic? More like Bojan.. uh.. BetterStartHittingQuick lmao  Jordan Clarkson? Loser who is a loser with ugly tattoos  Joe Ingles has been jingled  Royce O'Neale wants to be Shaq so bad he changed his last name
Jordan fucking Clarkson baybeee
Jazz are going to claw back and win it at the buzzer courtesy of Jordan Clarkson  Book it
"If he's trying to save his longevity, he should be coming off bench as he already knows and plays his role well. Like Jordan Clarkson, they are great players coming off the bench but that doesn't mean they should be starters."
that’s insane. some lakers fans think kuzma is better than jordan clarkson lol
Yeah it was! but without drafting dante exum instead of marcus smart. I dont know if we make the trade for jordan clarkson. so counter factuals fucking suck.
Because you personally can't tell he's half Filipino... Ngl man that's a pretty dumb metric. I would measure it by how he views himself. I have a European last name but I don't look white at all so who knows where I'd fall on your scale.   Also if you search up Jordan Clarkson both google and wikipedia refer to him a filipino-american basketball player.
Jordan Clarkson is going full on Prime Jamal Crawford this season off the bench. Dude is a bucket and a half.  They have plenty of offense and then Gobert is back there just to clean everything up defense.
Hachimura? Does Jordan Clarkson count?
"You can't look at just raw stats dude.  I watched those Jazz teams, shit, Stockton sent the Jazz to the NBA Finals during my High School Graduation.  The starters for the 97 team would jump out on the current team, but dude go look at the bench those Finals teams had. There's nobody there that's going to really slow down Jordan Clarkson and guys like Joe Ingles tended to exploit them (Eddie Johnson and Vernon Maxwell often would magically get hot against Utah) and Sloan's schemes tended to leave shooters open--- Snyder's system generates the most open looks in the league.  Stockton and Malone are far better than anyone on the current roster is, but Hornacek isn't better than Conley, Mitchell, Gobert, Bojan, or maybe even Clarkson. Bryon Russell would be the 90's teams 4th best player and he's about the Royce O'Neale/Ingles tier who is solid but you'd have 6-7 players from the modern team that are as good or better than the 97's 4th best guy."
"The Cavs in LeBron's last season during his second stint. Right after making the trades that landed Larry Nance Jr, Jordan Clarkson etc."
"Jordan Clarkson should be 6MOTY, but his tattoos don't look good - i especially hate faces as tattoos"
Jordan Clarkson is the most godly JC of all time  don’t @ me
"remember that jordan clarkson used to be in a few bad laker teams early in his career. now, he's probably a frontrunner for 6moy on a team that's in good position to be a top seed this year. nothing to feel bad"

Is Jordan Clarkson a fucking God or a fuckin robot ?
I mean yeah that’s the difference in getting a bench warmer or a guy who could be in the rotation.   It wasn’t going to get a guy who would drastically let Utah make a significant leap but it’d be the difference between like a Jordan Clarkson and a Dante Exum
Jordan clarkson
"Jordan 'Didn't Push off' Clarkson has been having a great season, and at this point I think he's the favorite for 6MOTY, but nah he ain't getting into the ASG."
Jordan clarkson is everything we wanted exum to be.
"Jordan Clarkson gonna go off for an efficient 24 points, we're gonna get Jingled, and Rudy is going to go for 19 points and 16 rebounds this game. The final score will be Utah 114 to Dallas 96."
"Jordan the ""sixth man coming"" Clarkson bout to drop 50"
"I hope Mike makes it, but he’s gotta be joking suggesting Jordan Clarkson could get in, right?! No disrespect to Clarkson, he’s having a nice season (and a nice game last night particularly), but nowhere near all-star level."
"Gobert and Conley are 1 and 2. Gobert's offense has actually dropped quite a bit, but I expect that's more of a fluke than anything. He's the best player on the team even though Conley is playing extremely well.  After those two it's Mitchell or even Jordan Clarkson. Clarkson has been a better player minute by minute on both ends, but he's obviously not playing as many minutes.   Mitchell has had some really good games but also some extremely bad stinkers. Average it all out and he's about the same player as he was last year...which is still a really good player. But Gobert, Conley, and Clarkson (in his role) have been extraordinary."
Hell I'd argue Jordan Clarkson too lol.
"Surprised it wasn't Jordan Clarkson lol.  Hopefully this is the year Conley finally gets his well-deserved All-Star nod. I think between Utah fans, Memphis fans, and the rest of the NBA, he can make it."
"Zion obvious answer. But all the best pro eaters are skinny dudes, I’m gonna go with someone random like Jordan Clarkson"
why couldn’t jordan clarkson do this for Lebron and the Cavs!? him and Jae Crowder both stunk it up with Lebron then left and went back to being good players lmao.
"It's not just Clarkson having the right mindset and getting comfortable with the Jazz, his [shot selection](https://www.slcdunk.com/2021/1/19/22229654/utah-jazz-sixth-man-jordan-clarkson-efficiency-god) is also getting better. Plus, he's [not a black hole on defense](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Jordan Clarkson&amp;season=2021) unlike his Laker days.  That two improvements alone speaks volumes on great coaching. And coaching good talent leads to that result."
Jordan Clarkson is a tremendous pain in the ass
"Jordan Clarkson has become an electric scorer. This team is legit and deeper than anyone else.  Mitchell, Gobert, Conley, Bojan, Clarkson, Ingles, and Royce might all be top 100 players in the league."
I mean Jordan Clarkson hit some crazy ass shots. Look at the full game highlights lol
Happy to see Jordan Clarkson balling out for Utah
Gobert with 29pts 20 rebounds.  Joe Ingles 7-11 from deep.  Jordan Clarkson off the bench 31pts in 33 minutes. Clarkson for 6MOY
"idk it feels like when they go at each other nothing happens, they just end up blocking and passing. KP just gets cooked by jordan clarkson and other quick guards."
Jordan Clarkson
I hope Jordan Clarkson gets Joe Ingles' face as his next tattoo
I would never have believed how much I'd come to love Jordan Clarkson in the last 13 months
"All I can see in the NBA play by play stream is ""JORDAN CLARKSON..."" and another ""Jordan Clarkson"""
So Jordan clarkson might be the best player ever
JORDAN CLARKSON DPOY!
Omg this defense. Jordan Clarkson stuffffffff.
The Jordan Clarkson show
jfc... Jordan. Fucking. Clarkson.
Jordan Clarkson has been so enjoyable to watch this season
"That team was really fun, a lot of it was because Spida was out doing things rookies shouldnt be doing. I do however like the team you guys have right now though. You guys have been playing great and you seem like a really good cohesive team. Jordan Clarkson has been a great add to the team as well, he seems to have finally found his role in the NBA with you guys."
Nephews push hard for any scenario that helps their team and is valid in the online trade machine tool.  Nephews on my sub wanted to trade away the Tatum and Brown picks a few years ago.  Last year the Bill Simmons nephs had Indy giving us Myles Turner and signing Jordan Clarkson as our 6th man.
he is already eligible. Jalen Green is still considered american afaik. Both him and Jordan Clarkson could possibly play for us but I think there are nationality hoops they need to jump.
Jordan clarkson was certainly selling during the finals
"A lot of comments saying its like the 1st year LeBron was with the Lakers, but LeBron was injured (and many were also) and we didn't get to see them at full strength in the playoffs.  I prefer thinking of a supporting cast like George Hill, Larry Nance Jr., Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson, with Jordan Clarkson coming as the 6th man. If the Kings are just as good as these cats, than LeBron can make them contenders, as proven in 2018."
"LMAO. Undeniable truth is yall didn't make it out of the first round! How are you going to beat LeBron? I can tell you, Jordan Clarkson is not gonna take you over the top."

Jordan Clarkson is so sexy
Feeling a Jordan Clarkson career high kinda night
"Specifically about Asians, not necessarily JapaneseI guess it depends on if we're counting Asian or Asian-American.   If the later, Jordan Clarkson is Filipino. Spo is also half Filipino.   Kanter of course is Turkish.  Jalen Green and Kai Satto are both in g league ignite. And I guess if we're counting Asian Americans and g leaguers Jeremy Lin would fall into that list too!"
"The next closest was Bradley Beal with .46, then Jordan Clarkson &amp; Terrance Ross tied at .45, and 5th was Kevin Durant at .44"
THT is less random than Jordan Clarkson........ okay
"Again, missing the point....  The Jazz aren’t some top contending team ready to make the leap and win a title. But I guess that might not be what you want for your team anyway.  You’re blaming injuries? Instead of giving some credit to Mitchell, you blame injuries for the loss? I am honestly unsure what point you assholes are trying to make. Is he a good playmaker or not? Stop flip flopping around saying Jordan Clarkson might be better."
"yep his COD teammates:  mike conley, jordan clarkson and royce oneale"

Never mind. If Mike Conley/Jordan Clarkson/Joe Ingles are better playmaker then what is wrong with what Charles/Shaq are saying? Y’all should be hoping Mitchell develops to be a better playmaker than the 3 of those guys together lol.   I would say average playmaker for a point guard of all star caliber.

Just a wanna be Jordan Clarkson
Who's that Jesus Christ guy? JC Stands for Jordan Clarkson
"In case you didn’t know, Jordan Clarkson is the second coming of Jesus Christ."
Jordan Clarkson on his cheat code mode tonight
"Not really into favorites, but I do have players that I like to watch all around, besides the obvious ones I'd say Jordan Clarkson, Jaylen Brown, Draymond, Jeff Green, Jeremi Grant  From the new players I liked Quickley a lot and also Cole Anthony since their games against the Cavs."
"I 've heard it said about Trae, Lavine, Booker, Kemba, Kyrie, Sexton, Beal and now Lamelo. It's such an inconsitently subjective and unfair narrative.  Elite scorer on a bad team? You're just an overhyped Jordan Clarkson."
"George Hill, JR Smith, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, Jose Calderon were the guards for the 2018 Cavs in the playoffs."
you know i gotta rep Jalen Green the same reasons i rep Jordan Clarkson lol
COLLIN “HIS CEILING IS A WALMART JORDAN CLARKSON” SEXTON
"How is garland doing? As a laker fan since the Jordan Clarkson days, I found myself watching some Cavs from time to time, even when Lebron was ok the Lakers.   And I felt some connection bc the Lakers selected garland."
Jordan Clarkson has looked like the second coming of Michael Jordan so far
"LBJ was playing with Jordan Clarkson and Kevin Love. Definitely not calling anything, but their teams are a bit more evenly matched these days to say the least."
"Yea it’s not like he made the finals with players like Jordan Clarkson, Matthew Delevadvo, and Iman Shumpeet."
"Drummond is the most frustrating player I've ever seen.   I'd rather watch Jordan Clarkson ""Kobe LARPing"""
No it's clearly Jordan Clarkson
Mike Conley showing up and helping D-Mitch on offense + Jordan Clarkson giving everyone buckets has really transformed them.
"Bubble Conley was pretty good, but yeah, Conley had a bit of a rough start to his Jazz career. Jordan Clarkson has been cash."
I think the biggest difference has been Mike Conley playing like Mike Conley instead of the shell of himself he was most of last year  EDIT: And Jordan Clarkson has been even more legit

is Jordan Clarkson always the subway sub of the game
Good god Jordan clarkson
Jordan Clarkson is good. But he doesn’t have anything on the GOAT Evan Turner
"Not that he’s on the same level by any stretch, but didn’t Jordan Clarkson go to OSU? I suppose I could just google it."
"For real. 2 weeks ago Chuck was making the argument for Jordan Clarkson to make the All star game over Booker Paul Derozan Conley Davis etc.   If you actually think they know shit about the current NBA you’re a fool. You reading this, they couldn’t name your teams 7th man"
&gt; Because the front page of this site would have you believe the refs stole this game from the Jazz.   LOL what are you on about? The front page is full of posts harping on Mitchell for 'whining' about refs while putting up terrible stats at the end of the game.  This is typical r/nba behavior. The refs are bad unless a small market complains about it and then suddenly everyone on this sub thinks the refs are the most un-biased arbiters of justice the world has ever seen.  Take a look at [this](https://twitter.com/bballbreakdown/status/1367303855516491776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1367303855516491776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclutchpoints.com%2Fjazz-news-video-proof-of-donovan-mitchell-bizarre-offensive-foul-call-jordan-clarkson-reacts%2F) and tell me it's not a ridiculous call.
"Yeah I still think Jordan Clarkson is at the top, but Brunson belongs in the conversation at least"
Mitchell? All I see is Jordan Clarkson
"I didn’t turn shit off, would have missed the golden moments like Kaman taking a snooze on the bench. Or getting pissed off at Jordan Clarkson for most of the game but having to suck it up because he was the only player that could make a free throw to save his life. The drama between Swaggy and DLO was better than any reality chick flick, and then laughing my ass off when Nick celebrated his 3 pointer early and then missed it. Kobe calling his teammates soft like shit was classic. Robert Sacre was my boy. Larry Nance Jr dunking on KD is still the background on my phone. Can’t enjoy the good times without reveling in the bad ones my friend."
"Absolutely. If Jordan Clarkson wasn’t going bonkers on the Jazz, Melo would be the front runner for sixth man of the year."
I mean he's to the Clips what Jordan Clarkson is to the Jazz. Great bench player that incites bench productivity.
"Tyrese Haliburton, Jordan Clarkson, Norman Powell, Montrezl Harrell, Enes Kanter"
"Dragic’s a good choice for sure.   I’d add Jordan Clarkson, Gary Trent Jr., Nerlens Noel, Norman Powell, Joe Ingles (if he still comes off the bench, can’t remember), Shake Milton’s should get to be in this category too with some consistency. Saric has been kind of amazing in Phoenix as a bench big as well.  edit: Naz Reid"
"Jordan Clarkson ran into the ref the other day and lost the ball, nothing happened"
we just saw Jordan clarkson over pass   what has Synder done to this man
Nothing you can do when theyre making heavily contested 3s. Jordan Clarkson banking them in lmao. Doesn’t really have much to do with 3pt difference when they just make what they’re taking.
The bank is open when Jordan Clarkson wants it to be
"Putting all the elements of an offensive weapon together, I think Kyle fits that bill the greatest.  I classify Norm as a pure scorer, who's #1 priority is to get the ball in the hoop by themselves, exactly like Jordan Clarkson. (Both have very low assist numbers)"
Jordan Clarkson and a million tattoos
Lmao worked well with Jordan clarkson
He’s bad. I’ll be suprised if he gets more than Jordan Clarkson money this offseason.
" Jordan Clarkson played his worst game in a while, shooting 4/17 from the field, reason why the Jazz lost"
"Jordan Clarkson played his worst game in a while, shooting 4/17 from the field, reason why the Jazz lost"
Jordan Clarkson regression to the mean
Did they not know that Jordan Clarkson is a playa
jordan clarkson baby
JORDAN CLARKSON CAN GO 0/30 DOESNT MATTER HES GOING 1/31
Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior Jordan Clarkson?
Jordan Clarkson nods. . .Challenge Accepted!
Lol.  I like how you're asking hypothetical questions like you can't just watch the game and find out.  The Sixers went small and played fast so they could force Gobert away from the rim and force more individual mismatches with Harris and Simmons attacking much smaller players.   That works to a point because it makes our defense less effective but it also means that you lose the game because small ball no defense doesn't work so well against a team that has a better small ball offensive lineup.   Hence why Jordan Clarkson gets 40 points off the bench.  Ben can't guard literally everybody.
He was a perfect fit. Our defense is so deep we are pushing the mantle.  We needed a bananas scorer. Defense be damned.  Jordan Clarkson is that guy.
Simmons guarding Gobert? lol. He probably should've been using his amazing on ball perimeter defence and guarding Jordan Clarkson in that game.
"Mitchell was probably a little better last year than this year, and Bogey was better last year and this year. Gobert was also better last year than this year. All 3 have still been good this year.  Joe Ingles was average last year, but has been amazing this year. Jordan Clarkson was even better this year than last year (he should also be MIP). Mike Conley turned it on late last year, and he has been much better this year. Favors is a much better player than Bradley. Niang is more playable this year.  The Jazz have been playing this style of passing the ball around for quite some time, with occasional iso play. We just needed to hit our shots.  What people forget in that 2018-19 Houston series, we couldn't hit shit, and I felt we got better shots than Houston in Game 3 and 5."
"Overrated: Donovan Mitchell -- guy is an all-star 100%, but media talking heads are trying to get him in the MVP conversation when Gobert or Conley are technically having more consistent and stronger seasons than he is.   Underrated: Jordan Clarkson. He's getting 6MOY hype, but I don't people who don't closely follow the Jazz realize how good he is playing this year. If you compare his PER 36 stats to somebody like Devin Booker, they're actually really similar (Clarkson averaging fewer assists, more rebounds, and more steals, but similary scoring and shooting)."
"everyone knows that jordan clarkson is the real star on the utah jazz, and he dropped like 42 on philly"
"I partially agree however there are some odd things like Jordan Clarkson never had a real big problem with his shot selection it was more of just not having the same role in offensive sets as last season. If you see the games closely, Clarkson is getting so many more opportunities on Flat sets, rush plays, and freelance opportunities and he's capitalizing and the passing isn't just Mitchell, the whole teams ball passing is a beauty to watch."
They take and make more 3 pointers. Plus Bojan Bagdanovic being healthy is huge. That’s all I see that’s different. Jordan Clarkson scoring like the 6MOY off the bench doesn’t hurt either.
"Jordan Clarkson being a Top 15 player this year by Offensive RAPTOR was uhh...unexpected, to say the least."
DeAndre Jordan Clarkson better
"Look, I understand that it's common for people to try to trade garbage for real assets but this isn't one of those times.  Have you watched either of those guys?  Luke is a 6'5"" guard that shoots 44% from 3 and is only 24.  Hes going to make ~$14M.  Similar cost to Jordan Clarkson and Kyle Kuzma.  Far from terrible for a great shooter that is still improving.    Marcus morris was highly sought after last off-season during FA.  He's shooting a blistering 49.2% from 3 and can guard 3-5.  He's going to make ~$16M per year.  That's around what Bertans and Derrick White are going to make.  Raptors want young guys and vets and these 2 fit those needs.  They're both in long contracts that are easily tradable.  Clips just don't have 1st round draft picks to offer.  Even though it won't happen, if clips included Zubac then raptors would accept.  Keep in mind raps are rebuilding and don't expect to contend for a couple years."
"i'm curious as to why you think that? no one on the jazz is significantly out-performing their career averages when it comes to shooting, which is without a doubt their greatest weapon, outside of maybe jordan clarkson and royce o'neale. compare that to someone like marcus morris for the clippers who is shooting a whopping 9% better from three than his previous best, or paul george who's shooting 7% better than at any other season"
They were the best 3pt shooting team last season and won 19/21 before the shut down. They are 45-8 in their last 53 regular season games. They were the #1 offense since the moment Jordan Clarkson arrived last year. I think they're like #3 this year.  I don't know what else people need to see to consider this sustainable.
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
Closer to Jordan Clarkson
"I'll agree, based on the betting lines that someone else posted, that Toronto was the favourite. But I'll also refer back to two points I made in a [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/8fzwrk/day_before_game_1_and_free_talk_raptors_vs/dy7swyp/) just before that series started about why I didn't believe in the narrative that ""the Pacers outplayed the Cavs so we shouldn't have any problems""  First, the Cavs shot really poorly in the Indiana series:  &gt; A lot of Cleveland role players shot the ball unusually poorly. It's exceptionally unlikely that JR Smith, Jose Calderon, George Hill, Rodney Hood, and Jordan Clarkson will combine to shoot 26% from deep over a full series again. As a team they only made 34% of their threes with defenders 4+ feet away compared to 39% during the regular season.  I figured they would regress... and wouldn't ya know it, they shot 46% on those same threes against the Raptors.  Second, the Pacers had the best transition offense in the league that year while the Cavs had the 4th-worst transition defense and it *really* showed in that series — both in the stats and watching the games. Meanwhile, the Raptors had a good-but-not-great transition offense in the regular season and when they met the Cavs in the playoffs they didn't exploit the Cavs weak transition defense nearly as much as the Pacers did.  So I guess I'd say that yes, the Raptors were favourites by public perception, but maybe they shouldn't have been."
"\- They have arguably the best pure defensive player in the league. Rudy just completely shuts down the paint. He's the DPOY  \- Mitchell improved his playmaking this year. He's now a threat to set up teammates as well as scoring  \- Mike Conley is back to his old self - great playmaking, shooting, defense and leadership - and not hobbled by last year's injury  \- Jordan Clarkson is the 6MOTY, he's an absolute flamethrower and 2nd units just have no answer for him  \- Knockdown shooters like Bojan and Ingles who play meaningful minutes  \- Great depth pieces like Royce O'Neal and Derrick Favors  They're just a complete team top to bottom with few, if any, weaknesses. The biggest one is the lack of a clear-cut superstar, which has hurt great regular season teams before in the playoffs. It remains to be seen how it will affect them, and if Mitchell can take that next step and become that superstar level player."
"You know what I really dislike about Laker fans? Way before I visited this sub I was in an FB group called LakerGang because one of my friends invited me over there and holy shit they really put Laker jerseys on every Free Agent Star they could find. Dirk, Klay, LeBron, Duncan, Wade, Butler, KD you name it. Shit was blasphemous as hell. But of course, they end up unsuccessful and try to play GM or even worse, convince themselves that they drafted a steal. Jordan Clarkson = Russell Westbrook or Julius Randle = mobile Shaq and the worst comparison yet Ryan Kelly = white KD."
You don’t think Jordan Clarkson can create? You don’t think Ingles and Favors in the PnR can create?
Why did Ben Simmons let Jordan Clarkson get 40 that same game if he is some kind of impressive defensive stopper?
"That's a lot of words to say ""Jordan Clarkson for three!"""
"I'd personally put Kawhi over DeMar. People look at the one year stint at the be all/end all. Kawhi did more in one year that DeMar couldn't accomplish in 9. DeRozan in the playoffs was hard to watch and people called Vince quitting bad. DeRozan going to a podium and publicly stating ""I'll pay anyone $100  to stop LeBron"" after being swept and only to be swept the next year.   He was getting benched for Norman Powell and OG as rookies in the playoffs. And his final moment as a Raptor was getting tossed for freaking clotheslining Jordan Clarkson down 30 on route to a second straight year being swept. I'll take Kawhi winning a championship in one of the most impressive individual performances in the last 30 years."
No bro he’s JR Smith aka Jordan Clarkson
"he can be a quick offense 6th man type of guy, someone like Lou Williams, Jordan Clarkson and Jamal Crawford."
He is more like jordan clarkson coming off bench look for score above passing I really cant see klay comparison its bit forced tbh
Jordan clarkson?
People who used to call him tall Jordan Clarkson need to apologize to Clarkson
"I get your point, but it’s not like you guys are going to play your starting 5 all 48 minutes in the playoffs. They will play a lot but there will still be time for Jordan Clarkson and Ingles to play against your bench."
"Oh for sure. Mitchell is a phenomenal player but he tends to pretty frequently have those 30% shooting nights, which used to screw you guys. Now you got the best player in the league Jordan Clarkson to carry the slack."

"Lakers could really use Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson and Brandon Ingram right about now 👀"
Would love to hit up Crown Burger with Jordan Clarkson
is it even fair we have Jordan Clarkson through 2023-24 with a player option in that year?
Jordan Clarkson has come a long way.
"Jordan ""Wardell Stephen Curry"" Clarkson"
Jordan Clarkson has the greenest light ever and I love it.
Jordan Clarkson is my god
Jordan Clarkson cant be stopped
Jordan Clarkson eats pizza all the time in SLC and doesn't get sick. Clearly the superior Jordan
Fun fact: Kobe's last ever NBA assist was to Jordan Clarkson
"Its honestly frustrating watching us move the ball, work hard to get open 3s just to brick them while jordan clarkson goes down and makes a contested pull up 3 5 seconds into the shot clock"
Jordan Clarkson out there looking real cute
They thought jfc is for Jesus fucking Christ? it's Jordan fucking Clarkson!
Jordan Clarkson is the greatest Jordan to ever play the game  Even better than Jordan Hill
Trading for Jordan Clarkson is one of the best front office moves in Jazz history
Jordan Clarkson is unreal
Jordan Clarkson vs. Kyle Kuzma*
Can’t hate on the red hot shooting Jazz! Been following their games since the 5th game winning streak and they’re insane. Quality ball movement and shooting.   Happy to see Jordan Clarkson blow up to where he is. Ever since he moved on from us he’s been nothing but stellar. Potential being realized by the rest of the league. 6MOY right there.   Let’s have a good game 🔥🙏
Who is Jordan Clarkson?
"no I mean Jordan Clarkson, 2017 season, there was a stretch where he didn't get an assist and couldn't buy a bucket and everyone clowned him for it"
"Jae Crowder. IT4, Jordan Clarkson, and Dee Wade 😎"
1. Deron Williams (2016) 2. Jordan Clarkson (that one year he forgot how to pass) 3. Andrew Bogut (most valuable 40 seconds in NBA history)
If he ever gets the 6MOY over Clarkson he’d be surpassing a Jordan
"Jordan Clarkson is not a top 20 player in the NBA, what the fuck kind of sport are you watching?"
Jordan clarkson isn’t really snubbed and wood is injured. Conley isn’t that good statistically.
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
"This year, Jordan Clarkson is top 20. He's going to be 6MOY."
"Jordan Clarkson, take out Lebron"
"so do you think jordan clarkson is a top 20 player in the NBA? like if we reset the league and re-drafted every team, where do you think clarkson should go? and if not top 20, why?"
Other exception is our lord and savior JC (Jordan Clarkson)
" &gt;	Two defensive centers - Gobert and Ayton.    Really understating how much better Gobert is than Ayton. Guys like mikal bridges and Cameron Payne are inexperienced, while Joe Ingles, Bojan, Derrick Favors, Jordan Clarkson all have experience."
The disrespect to Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson rejects your science!
"Id go Capela over Warren. Warren had a decent run for a bit last year and that’s it. I’d go Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, Jordan Clarkson and would debate Joe &amp; Gary Harris over Warren too from that draft class."
"Jordan Clarkson was their second rounder in 2014 and he's having a great season too, the 6MOY frontrunner on the best team in the league."
The all Kendall Jenner starting 5:  PG Jordan Clarkson  SG Devin Booker  SF Ben Simmons  PF Kyle Kuzma  C Blake Griffin
Jordan Clarkson for me. It's like the joy of watching a puppy play with a bubble machine. He seems to be so happy and free.
"We are spoiled as Laker fans.  If I'm a Cavs fan, do whatever you have to do win one ring.  I've celebrated 9 titles in my life prior to this bubble title.  It isn't all about winning to me.  I also want to like the players on the court.  I preferred the 17 win team over the current team.  A bunch of humble young dudes who are going to work their tails off to be the best players they can be.  It isn't any surprise you have Ingram and Randle playing at an all star level.  You have Jordan Clarkson being far and away the leader for sixth man of the year."
Michael Jordan Clarkson started the run in the 4th tho.
"Very similar to my thoughts on the subject. Jordan Clarkson is going to see heavy minutes, and he isn't exactly All-Defense material."
Good looking out. Just trying to calibrate when to offload these ol' cards :)   I pulled the trigger on these cards when I started a Jazz fan channel last year and watched Filipinos go NUTS for Jordan Clarkson out of nowhere. My subscriber count like tripled over night on his 1st solid performance.   Any who hoping for the best for him and the Wizards even though I hate Westbrook.
"The sheer power of Jokic gives 2014 a good case as the best one also  NIkola Jokic, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson, Glenn Robinson III. Looking at it more yeah it is better than 2012  Issue with 2nd round picks is even the guys who end up good often take years to do so and the team who drafts them doesnt think they are good and ends up dumping them. Crowder, Barton, Dinwiddie, Harris, Grant, none of these are guys who did it on the team that drafted them really."
"Dwyane Wade said this recently lol, if he could come in the league and be anyone he’d be Jordan Clarkson.   Beyond getting a green light and swag, also gets to play 20ish mpg and save his knees"
Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson all day. Chuck up shots and look crazy in whatever I wear
Why tf were you comparing him to Jordan Clarkson Lmao
I kept getting downvoted for saying he was better than Jordan Clarkson.
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5.

"Ah okay, adding jordan clarkson must compare to losing james fucking harden, adding harden/kd/kyrie, losing Ibaka/gasol"
fwiw 6th man of the year Jordan Clarkson dropped 40 on Simmons
The physical transition of Jordan Clarkson is incredible
"This is just a plain stupid take.   Our rotation was:  **Starters:** George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson.   **Bench:** Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Larry Nance Jr.   And then the three guys to round out our roster were Jose Calderon, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.  Please enlighten me; what about this roster screams *great team*?"
Jordan clarkson
"Ah, the Jordan Clarkson role"
He’s best as a bench scorer.  He reminds me a little of Jordan Clarkson/Lou Will but he’s honestly quicker and more athletic but with a much shakier jumper.
"Jordan Clarkson. The dude has his off nights some games, but I feel he contributes way more then people think."
"GL spamming PnRs when they just ignore green/oubre/wiseman/wiggins cause they are not consistent scoring threats. Just need a damn Jordan Clarkson-esque player on this team to feast, someone who can shoot and score. Someone like Klay :("
"From getting clowned by Draymond about his retirement tour, to having LeBron, George Hill, and Jordan Clarkson blow out the Celtics during his jersey retirement day, to having the worst takes of all time, to this... it has not been a good few years for Paul Pierce lmao"
Trae Young &gt; Jordan Clarkson
I don't need to see how Jordan Clarkson plays against the Timberwolves or the Rockets.
"lol ""extremely good"". I look forward to watching Jordan Clarkson shoot you out of games in the playoffs"
Why is Steph Curry the reason Jordan Clarkson takes 8 3s per game?  Please tell us
mods removed this but will let someone ask if you’d rather have jordan clarkson or tyler herro on your team
"i mean, if a player is even worth mentioning in a thread like this, i'm almost certain an nba team would find a spot for them in the starting line-up (unless they're taking a 6th man role, like jordan clarkson or prime lou will).   even the nets would start CP3, they'd just move kyrie to the 2, harden to the 3, durant to the 4 and create an ultra death 160ppg line-up"
"...idk, if you ask my mom if she knows Jordan Clarkson, she wouldn't have any idea, but if I ask her if she knows Kevin Durant or Lebron James or Steph Curry, she knows for sure."
"well ofc they know his name, it’s jordan clarkson"
PG - Goran Dragic  SG - Jordan Clarkson  SF - Joe Ingles  PF - Montrezl Harrell  C - Chris Boucher
Guard lover's dream: Conley/Mitchell vs. CP3/Book with a side of Cam Payne vs. Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson. I felt like he had that bounce like an all star. Thought he could’ve gotten to that Zach Lavine level.
Jordan Clarkson
Mike Conley is playing like Mike Conley again. Mitchell has raised his game yet again. Bojan is back from injury. Gobert is playing the best season of his career. Joe Ingles is leading the league in TS%. Jordan Clarkson has become an automatic bucket off the bench. Gobert’s backup minutes are going to Derrick Favors instead of Tony Bradley.  Plus we were already the best 3pt shooting team in the league last year and simply decided to turn that up to 11.  We’re really just firing on all cylinders at every position this season... except our 3rd stringers. They’ve turned many 30 points blowouts into 15 point wins this season.
The Jordan Clarkson 2020-2021 version is the best version so far.. so yes it's wise to get him right now but Herro has a bright future in the next years to come
Lou Williams got the Jordan Clarkson green light on the Hawks lol
"&gt;What?  The Lakers win a ring every 4 years, on average, and Towns would've been a Laker for 5 by now.  Their rate is much higher when they have a top center, as well, somewhere around 50%, actually.  So he'd certainly have one, and quite likely more.  Towns has been an extremely good player from his 2nd season on, and if you think about their roster moves over the past 6 years, it's obvious they'd have been very competitive with Towns.    Had they drafted Towns instead of Russell, in 2017 they'd have had Towns, Randle, Ingram, Nance up front and even though young, that's as-good as anyone's frontcourt. They'd have never signed Mozgov -- almost certainly a guard, instead.  Maybe they still draft Zubac in the second round to backup Towns -- which is by-far the best center tandem in the league in short order -- or they flip him for a guard, because they wouldn't need or want Muscala.  They don't sign Andrew Bogut's corpse, either.  They probably don't dump Jordan Clarkson and Nance to clear that second max free agent spot, since they wouldn't need to.  They don't waste a 2019 second trading for Roy Hibbert, either.  They don't trade for Thomas Bryant, either.  There's not any telling who'd they'd draft after that point, but that front office did not really miss on draft picks, so they would likely be good.  They probably don't trade for Kuzma, but don't really need him anyway with the aforementioned forwards.  They almost certainly don't spend two more late-first round picks on centers in Moe Wagner, and Tony Bradley if they have Towns -- probably get guys like Derrick White, or Jalen Brunson instead.  They also don't fire Byron Scott in 2016, who was a very good coach.  The Lakers have wasted a ton of assets since 2015 in searching for a quality big man, and then blew an unprecedented package of assets to rent one last season.  With Towns, none of that would've been necessary, and they'd have been a far more attractive free-agent destination to boot.  There is basically no time in NBA history where the Lakers had a top 5 center and didn't at least make the Finals more often than not -- and the Lakers have had a top 5 center for about 30 seasons."
"&gt; 4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all.  If Nash tried to double the number of 3s he takes, then defenses would play him differently and prevent him from taking that many 3s. Nash has to focus on running on offense more than trying to take 9.4 3s a game. He'd shoot more 3s, like 7-8, but not 9.4 lol. And even shooting that many more 3s he wouldn't be averaging some of the ridiculous points I see on this thread.  &gt; single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he’s averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now  Van vleet has a faster shot release and doesn't have playmaking responsibilities like Nash would have.  &gt; Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier  All of those guys, aside from Lonzo, aren't the playmaking point guards of their team who have to run the offense like Nash has to.   &gt; If think fucking Steve Nash can’t attempt 9.4 or more in today’s game   He wouldn't, because the only guys taking them are Steph, Dame, and Buddy Hield."
"4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all. I’ve seen almost every single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he’s averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now and is NOT that great of a shot creator, taking ill advised shots is one of his worst qualities.   Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier all average 8-9 three point attempts a game. If think fucking Steve Nash can’t attempt 9.4 or more in today’s game then you are flat out misinformed and either never watch Nash play, don’t watch modern basketball or both."
Instant impact - Jordan Clarkson  For the Future- Tyler Herro
Jordan Clarkson pls
"I will give you answer from my experience in playing organized basketball.    Controlling the pace or dictating the tempo of the offensive play is done by the player who handles the ball. With the ball in his hands he decides what will he do once the attack gets going.   First fundamental thing you need to have is dribbling / not being stripped, and also not being cornered which makes you lose the ball. That's why it's so hard for big forwards and centers to be playmakers, they can't be safe with the ball at all times. Of course guys like Giannis, Durant and Jokic are exceptions.   Second fundamental thing you need is shot creation for yourself. Being able to drive at opportunity, shoot when necessary and attack on isolation. This is what many great 3andD guard guys lack, for example Klay Thompson is a better player than many first options in this league but there is not a team which will give Klay Thompson a position of first option player of the franchise. If you can't create points without being spoon fed the ball, your team will get found out on nightly basis. Second and first fundamental thing go hand in hand.   Third fundamental thing you need to have is passing ability, no matter how good of a shooter or offensive threat you are you need to be able to see open guys and pass to them. Jordan Clarkson can score 40 points a night and he still is not a good pace controller or play maker.   And the last thing that separates great playmakers from others is game experience and BBIQ. Knowing when to attack fast, knowing when to set a play and use as much of 24 seconds as possible and still score and things like that. For example when your team is down 10 points, and there is 3 minutes left on the clock, you can't really waste 24 seconds and you will try to get easy points as much as possible. Or for example when you are chasing a comeback you need rhythm and fast points, on the other side when you are leading and opponents are catching up, you use as much clock as possible to try to kill the momentum.   Now I'm sure that any NBA level playmaker knows all this and more, and what separates the guys you mentioned is that they are exceptional in one of the fundamentals.   LeBron is such a big offensive threat that he must be guarded by multiple guys, you must clogg the paint or else he will score 40 points just by layups,  you must also have one guy guard him in shooting areas since he can shoot and on top of all that he can dish it out to anyone. This gives him so much freedom and base to try to control and decide what's going to happen in offense.   Same as CP3, yes he can score, and he won't lose the ball, but also his passing and vision is legendary so the defenders can't do much but abide by his decisions on offense, which makes him great pace controller.   Luka and Harden fall in same category, great shooters who are great at driving and at passing. So the offense is set up in way for them to ISO, and find open man/kick out when they get doubled. That's a great tool for controlling the pace, am I going to shoot a stepback five seconds in, am I going to dribble in one spot for 20 seconds and just drive/get free throws, am I going to call for PnR and alley oop. There is equal chance of me doing all of this and it will all punish you if needed, that's why you can't commit to stopping one you need to think about all of it which makes my decision control the game pace."
So is Jordan Clarkson IIRC
"Wow. Mitchell is absolutely incredible. Joe Ingles is better then Joe Harris. Jordan Clarkson is a star coming off the bench. This team is incredible. By the way, they won by 46. Now obviously it’s the Magic, but beating ANY TEAM by 46 is impressive."

"Damn I wish the lakers had kept all their young stars, really they drafted so well. Lonzo, Dangelo, BI, Jordan Clarkson, Nance, Julius, Josh Hart, Zubac, Kuzma. They really could’ve turned into an insane squad organically. No patience at all 😭"
Jordan Clarkson was impressive in his playmaking and passing today.
Jordan Clarkson has is locked up IMO.
"There are only three ways to become a RFA:  1) A player drafted from the first round finishing his rookie contract regardless if either or both team options were picked up.  2) A player who finishes their first and/or second year in the league on a contract that was not a rookie contract, they become Arenas RFAs (see Jordan Clarkson). Players like Dort and Brunson signed 3-4 year contracts as rookies, they not become RFAs but UFAs instead.  3) Players coming off of two-way contracts become RFAs for their teams."
"Klay is legit the make or miss. Ppl hating on wiseman rn, but you're spot on, we need vets. Bazemore is our vet rn lol.   Klay makes or breaks this team because if he's even 85% of his normal self, the warriors starting 5 is quite elite.  Steph/klay/wiggins/dray/wiseman.  But the bench and that pick like u said are huge. Jordan clarkson for the jazz off the bench is amazing. Dubs need that spark."
"K-Love, TT, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, old Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, Jeff Green, young Ingram, young Randle, young Lonzo, young Kuzma, Rondo, and KCP... There are a lot of names there I would take over pretty much any of Steph’s current teammates apart from Draymond and maybe Wigs"
How I felt about 2015-2019 lakers tbh I used to whoop serious ass in 2k with Jordan Clarkson Ryan Kelly and Tarik black and them. 2018 and 19 especially we were just so fucking bad but god forbid the warriors or a good team came to town we’d ball the fuck out. I think the year before lebron came we went 4-0 again Spurs warriors rockets and okc but lost all to kings and other dogshit team
"I used to say I wish I had Jordan Clarkson confidence, but I think I really want Joe Ingles confidence 😍"
Patrick Williams hit the R2 turbo button as soon as he saw it was Jordan Clarkson who was gonna have to match onto him in transition lol
Just looking through the 2nd round in 2014 and there was several great players taken there. Makes you wonder wtf teams were thinking taking PJ Hairston over Jordan Clarkson joe Harris nikola Jokic etc
~~Jordan Clarkson~~ Andray Blatche best Filipino player of all time.
That’s just Jordan Clarkson
Joe Ingles or Thaddeus Young should win it but Jordan Clarkson probably will because voters are brain dead and only care about scoring. You might as well have a bunch of Twitter morons vote for SMOTY at this point.
Because not every game has Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan Clarkson is Filipino.
Shroder should of gotten last year. Jordan Clarkson is definitely getting it this year
"I remember him saying that he would've rather been a Jordan Clarkson because past the halfway point of his career, his knees were toast."
Kuzma Ben Simmons Blake Griffin Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson also probably going to get the 6th man
Jordan Clarkson.
Ben let Jordan Clarkson score 40 on him soooo =/=?
"he did score 28 last game  hes fuckin jordan clarkson man, this is what he does. hes gonna be totally fine. i have faith too."
One day I hope to be as confident as Jordan Clarkson
Jordan clarkson
"For sure there were some good parts about it, none of toxicity or doom &amp; gloom in every game thread because we're losing by a few points in the 2nd quarter. Hell if we were even close in some games it was a cause for celebration. I remember the dumb blind optimism that mostly didn't pan out (Xavier Henry, Mini-Mamba, Tarik Black), but sometimes did (Jordan Clarkson is about to win 6MOTY &amp; only some obcessed Lakers fans wouldve believed that possible half a decade ago)."
"&gt; Would you have been able to stop Jordan \[Clarkson\[?""   i think not bum ass draymond"
"Lu Dort: “Welcome to underpaid club Moses, we’ve been waiting for you. Have a seat next to Jordan Clarkson.”"
"You’re being ridiculous. 13 million for 32 year old broken Blake griffin. I could see LMA on a 5 mil legacy deal on the blazers or spurs or something, but he’s a minimum player. I actually can’t believe you just said Blake griffin is better than any sixth man in the nba. I’d rather have trezz, Jordan Clarkson, bobby fucking Portis, or goran for Blake griffin. For the money he’s on is slightly better than a fair deal. Not some unfair robbing of the league"
"I do watch the Mavericks.   He shoots a ton of catch and shoot 3’s.   He is a great player, but Jordan Clarkson’s appeal is literally the fact he is a shot creator. He plays like a Lou Williams-type.   If you think THJ creates as many shots as Clarkson does than you don’t watch Jordan Clarkson. I’m also not saying Clarkson is better, just pointing out that the voters typically award shot creators."
"He may only get matchup specific run in the playoffs, but I'm glad we have him for said matchups (Jordan Clarkson, dame, schroeder maybe)"
I've watched the Jordan Clarkson Lakers before Jordan Clarkson starting getting a bigger role in 2015. This was nothing.
"The annoying thing is he’d be great to be a Jordan Clarkson, come of the bench and just score but he still thinks he’s a starters in the league, as that is an attribute people care about these days"
"His mistakes are the most egregious but he still does enough good to be a positive player. Its just frustrating cos he's skilled, he's just... Low bb IQ in a very smart team. I still think he'd flourish in a 6 man microwave scoring role like Jordan Clarkson but that doesn't fit our team. Still, he has enough x factor and upside to get hot and win us a playoff game or 2 and we can't get anyone better than him cos we r small market."
Love him “Jordan Clarkson almost came in my lap”
1. Rudy Gobert  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Mike Conley  4. Joe Ingles  5. Jordan Clarkson  6. Bojan Bogdanovic  7. Royce O'neale  8. Georges Niang  9. Miye Oni  10. Matt Thomas or Ersan Ilyasova?
I always thought Burks would become what Jordan Clarkson is to the Jazz now. Damn the injuries and Tyrone Corbin.
Yeah good culture can do a lot for players.  Jordan Clarkson got traded for two second rounders and now he's a coveted piece on a playoff team.  Lauri sucks but on the Spurs or Heat he could turn things around I think.
I fucking love Jordan Clarkson. He has found his literal perfect niche in this Jazz team
And the Jordan Clarkson Subway Sub of the Game goes to... Jordan Clarkson
"Lakers gave up a top 5 pick, Lonzo, Ingram to get AD (plus Josh Hart and 2 future firsts). They gave up D'Lo to get Kuzma. They gave up Larry Nance and Jordan Clarkson in a way that cleared cap space for LeBron. Lakers have given up a lot of talent to get their dudes.   It's not like Dion Waiters was essential in their playoff run last year. Drummond would be their biggest buyout acquisition by far. What'd the Nets give up to get Harden+Kyrie+KD+Griffin+LMA? LaVert, D'Lo and some picks?"
Can I get a Jordan Clarkson jersey?
"Whilst that’s true, we are still a Top 10 offense and that’s with most of our guys out and before we added Fournier as our 6th man to bring some punch off the bench, ala a Jordan Clarkson. Kemba is starting to play he was last year.   You’re not wrong in that we’re a jump shooting team, but when we’re fully healthy, we’re a good jump shooting team. Basically a JV Clippers.   Sixers are an elite defensive team, but they don’t have *that* much offensive firepower, they have less than the Bucks do."
Don't forget Jordan Clarkson and Thomas Bryant too
Low/mid level Laker prospects are always overhyped. Jordan Clarkson was almost labeled as untouchable by Laker fans during the first year or two of his Laker days.
Fuck i forgot about him  Jordan Clarkson sounds like the least Filipino name ever tbh
at least Jordan Clarkson is repping
"It's mostly development. Most of the guys on your list come out of college  a dime a dozen.  There are so many 6'6 3 point shooters in college right now, but Joe Harris could fit any system and there was no way to know that.  There are so many ultra-athletic 6'8 guys in college that you don't know their true position - Jerami Grant developed the skill to go with the athleticism.  Jordan Clarkson - a non-flashy, mistake-free PG in college became a non-flashy, mistake-free combo guard in the NBA who could get a super hot hand. But it also took him a while to land in a situation where his talents were the best fit.  Jokic - he's just a unicorn. No one saw that coming and no one could have."
His name is Robert Paulson. His name is Jordan Clarkson.
"First of all, dwade went to the cavs n wasn't very good. No one expected Jordan Clarkson to be very good, we just hoped he could get hot at the right time and he didn't."
"Yea, I think I’d agree more with Wade if he was a lesser star like Westbrook or Bradley Beal, but being a 3 time champion and top 5 SG? Definitely better than being a Jordan Clarkson type."
In her defense Jordan Clarkson was GOD AWFUL in the playoffs (especially the Warriors) and there was a reason he racked up those DNP’s
2020-21 Jordan Clarkson
when did Jordan Clarkson get traded to Dallas?
Jordan Clarkson was not good. And now since he’s been relegated to scorer role off the bench he found a good role.
"The life of Lemmon pepper Lou &gt;&gt; Jordan Clarkson, with all due respect"
Don't we all want to be Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan UGL Clarkson
Bet he rates Jordan Clarkson a 9/10
He is usually the key impact player for most Jazz W’s Fkbert often makes a key Defensive play then cooks to the other end of the court faster than some guards .. and visa versa. The dude works hard Once you start watching them regularly it’s fun af to watch GOBERT and Jordan Clarkson or the 3 point barrage they unleash.
"Baby Jordan  &gt;!Jordan Clarkson, that is!&lt;"
"Dude i knew someone was going to say that 😭😭  What i mean by basketball player is like Jordan clarkson is a super good example of this when he was w the lakers.  That kid hadn’t figured out how to play 5 on 5 organized basketball. When he played it was all about scoring in any way he could, there wasnt any of the extra stuff he does now (even tho is still is a dynamic scorer off utahs bench)  A real basketball player doesnt just score, or do one specific thing. The real ball players are the guys like alex caruso, andre igoudala, ect  The guys who put it all together and do all the small things that help you put a win together"
"If Jordan Clarkson doesn’t get the call last night, no way can this one count"
"The only candidates I see are Randle (runaway), Jerami Grant, MPJ, Jordan Clarkson, and Jaylen Brown"
"I have to say I thought Hanlen was just another all flash no substance trainer, but the dude's clients are Barrett, Zach Lavine, Tatum, Beal, Embiid, and Jordan Clarkson. They're all absolute beasts this year who have improved their games a lot in the last couple of years so he must be doing something right."
Jordan Clarkson. Can't stand him and his chucking

Jordan Clarkson with the eye-popping stat line of 29 pts but -16 plus minus.
"I mean, you do seem like someone who would lick your screen ya mouth breather. Trae is Jordan Clarkson with a starting role. Enjoy your first round exit 😂"
Jordan Clarkson was so trash on the Cavs and now he's like the GOAT.
jordan clarkson experience
Jordan Clarkson is a career 34% 3pt shooter.         He's shot at 44% in 20 games vs Portland. Was it necessary for him to come to our division? I do wonder.
"He's literally just a young Jordan Clarkson, lol"
LOL  btw OP you left out jordan clarkson. ya dummy
Not that good. These guys all needed the ball to be successful. Ingram was an all star when he was the lead for the pelicans last year. Julius this year is the offense of the Knicks. DLo was the primary ball handler for the Nets when he was an All Star. And current Jordan Clarkson has the ultimate green light off the bench for Utah.  Talent was there but fit and who the coach would be the issue here. They all needed to grow on their own.
Didn't realize Jordan Clarkson was a ref
"Didn't think this was important enough to put in the main post, but Jordan Clarkson liked [this tweet of the play in question](https://twitter.com/BensHoops/status/1392206391654326272?s=19)."
One of my favorite r/nba thread comments:  “It’s Jordan Clarkson time!” - Jordan Clarkson
"Filipinos have become Jazz fans this year because Jordan Clarkson, too.  God help you all if he ever actually plays for the national team in meaningful games."
Also Utah has Jordan Clarkson (who's been fantastic this year) and Filipinos love basketball.  So there's a shitload of us who've switched to supporting Utah this year.
I just quoted your comment. He isn’t considered a starter because he doesn’t start. This is why you fail to grasp the understanding of the sixth man award. You seem to be under the impression that Jordan Clarkson somehow is a starter. I am here to educate and reassure you that he is not a starter. He comes off the bench.

It's almost like Ben Simmons was guarding Jordan Clarkson out there today.
"Jordan Clarkson, Beno Udrih, that motherfucker Dillon Brooks, Aaron Brooks, Armoni Brooks...  Basically, if your last name is Brooks, you torch Portland."
Jordan Clarkson made the Warriors WORK for this win.  Dude couldn’t miss and was on a mission towards the basket that whole 4th quarter.   Almost as if Kobe’s spirit touched him tonight…
The sixth man comes off the bench. Jordan Clarkson comes off the bench. It’s that simple
"Jordan Clarkson is an enigma. But shooters gonna shoot, and he almost pulled it through. I didn't think he was going to be good from his lakers stint, but the jazz found the perfect role for him. Shits great."
Lol. I’m not Jordan Clarkson. I’m not the Jazz. I’m a fan watching a game commentated by 2 dudes who were insufferably trying to be funny. The moments of praise during the game don’t automatically cancel out pettiness. Even your own fans agree. Relax.
"You're not taking into account the roles each player has, Jordan Clarkson has the second highest usage on the team whereas Joe Ingles is ranked 12th.   Clarkson's entire role is to come off the bench and lead the second unit by being super aggresive. Joe Ingles (who has started almost half the games he's played this season) is not the primary scorer whether he's starting or coming off the bench, when starting he would be the fourth option behind Mitchell, Conley and Bojan.   I'm not saying Ingles isn't a good player but there's a reason he is far more efficient while scoring less than Clarkson, they have two completely different roles."
Michael Jordan Clarkson is to reserve player shot attempts as Steph Curry is to 3 point shooting
"The Jordan Clarkson Experience: a game-high 41 points, a game low +/- of -17"
Never tell Jordan Clarkson the odds.
Tonight was the truest Jordan Clarkson experience you could ever have.
Jordan “JR Smith” Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson was so fucking hot in the 4th. Literally couldn’t miss for 5 minutes straight
"Michael Jeffrey Jordan Clarkson, man."
Michael Jordan Clarkson turned into DeAndre Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson with 41
Jordan Clarkson
JORDAN FUCKING CLARKSON
jordan clarkson is the pokémon evolution of jordan poole
"Nah, I believe in Donovan - he's just so lazy in the first 2 quarters like he's just hoping he's hot and gets to put away teams by shooting contested 3s only. Then finally in the 2nd half he decides to be more focused and attacks and reins in his shototing. In the playoffs he attacks more throughout the game to get a rhythm and everything else falls into place.  But yes, not sure I would bank on tonight's version of Jordan Clarkson to carry us through the playoffs."
Thank FUCK for Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson really is as dumb as a box of rocks. I hate his style so much.
Clarkson with the Jordan usage numbers this half
I’m pretty sure Bobby Portis leads the bench in scoring per 36 minutes and rebounds unless that’s Jordan Clarkson and Dwight but he’s definitely second for both.
Michael Jordan Clarkson is way overrated here. Clarkson on the court with hall of famers is going to get destroyed.
"This is simply not true, Ingram improved every year but Lebron joined the team that stunted his growth.   Lonzo Ball improved as well yearly.  Julius Randle improved a lot his last year with lakers.   Larry Nance was developed nicely   Jordan Clarkson was solid   Etc."
"Carmelo is a huge part of the blazers despite coming off the bench. Probably at least the third most important on the team. Sometimes even the most important if he’s hot. Look at D Rose, Jordan Clarkson, Dwight Howard. Just cuz you don’t start doesn’t mean you aren’t crucial."
"to me - several players  1. Jordan Clarkson 2. Alex Caruso \[ he's 6th by minutes, right? \] 3. Faku \[ best last name \]  Campazzo  I like the looks, the shooting forms, the fundamentals of quick guards."
Jordan Clarkson is Sixth Man
"All these awards have double standards. Other than DPOY, none of the awards really account for defense.   ROY really tends to be volume scoring dependent, but that said Melo really will win that I think since Edwards despite playing better since the break literally heaved his way to those averages.   6MOY is really the worst one of all. Literally just who scores more off the bench. Like I ask you...is there a more important sixth man than Dwight this year? We all know the on/off numbers for the Sixers in the past when Embiid goes to the bench. Dwight has been a rebounding monster and held it down. Is he not as impactful as Jordan Clarkson?   He isn’t even in the conversation and I’m saying is he should be."
Michael Jordan Clarkson would be awful cause MJ would end Clarkson's life when he takes a hero shot.
"Jordan Clarkson is currently the second highest scorer on the Utah jazz, but the jazz are a very deep team, so it’s not top heavy. He is only averaging 0.8 more ppg than Bogdanovic. Nice take"
Jordan Clarkson 👀
"Rudy Golbert - DPOY Quin Synder- COTY Jordan Clarkson - 6th man of the year Jazz - 1st seed, 2nd round playoff exit"
Deandre jordan clarkson*
Michael Jordan Clarkson is unbeatable.
Michael Jordan Clarkson
Second units need help too.  It's like how Jordan Clarkson isn't starting for Utah even with Mitchell and Conley out.
Right now he looks to be developing into a Jordan Clarkson type role.
"It's possible, but unlikely IMO.  Teams/coaches/trainers/players just understand the importance of rest now. For example, LeBron averaged 39 minutes a game last Finals (meaning nine minutes of rest.) Even in Game 6, he played 41 minutes. This isn't exclusive to LeBron nor does it mean players is past generations were ""tougher."" It just means today's league is smarter.  Also, it's imperative to the discussion to mention that the ""MJ 63-point game"" went to double OT. MJ played 53 minutes that game. Just to highlight how crazy that is, a player in this year's Finals could play in an OT game. Said player would have to play every second of regulation and every second of OT to get to 53 minutes.   And to top if off, a player would have to live at the FT line. MJ went 19-21 that game. Again, for reference, that's seven more free throws than the Lakers attempted in Game 6 of last year's Finals and one less than the Heat attempted in the same game.   It was just a perfect storm for MJ that evening. I am 100% not diminishing his game at all that night. Just stating how all the stars have to align for it to be possible. Look at Kobe's 60-pointer in his final game. He shot FIFTY times. He was 6-21 from 3. Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance had higher +/- that evening. Any coach worth a damn would stop that volume shooting early in a playoff game and switch the gameplan. And even then Kobe didn't get to 63. Again, not a knock on Kobe. Just showing how damn near impossible it is to reach 60 even in the regular season. It becomes much more challenging in the postseason when teams buckle down - both offensively and defensively - and stuff that happens in the regular season isn't allowed to happen in the playoffs."
Utah had him last year and he had a chance to be a Jordan Clarkson type role but just didn’t have the upside to keep in rotation.
Maybe Jordan Clarkson for Jazz fans
"as of now i think Jordan Clarkson is the likely type of player he will become, but he has the tools to be a second option 20+ ppg scorer"
I think Anfernee Simons might end up as a Jordan Clarkson/Lou Williams type player. 6th man scorer who can shoot with bad defense.
Hopefully this Jazz superteam with GOAT level players like Rudy Gobert and Jordan Clarkson will let the Lakers at least win one game.
So Westbrook is a bigger loser than Jordan Clarkson?  Just want to make sure I'm hearing you right
"I know Niang, I think he was the guy your fan base likes to blame from time to time. This rookie Oni is who I saw for the first time, and he was also impressive. And I do not even want to think about scary guys like (Michael) Jordan Clarkson.  I did not expect a game like this, I expected some 99:95 score. We lost a lot of offense, this is supposed to be our defensive lineup, lol. You were also crap on defense, but better than us on offense, so deserved to win. Well, congrats on the win, and onto the next."
"Like  when Cavs (LeBron) traded IT for Nance Jr and Jordan Clarkson and all the media was freaking out how Lebron got SUPERSTARS on his team and who can stop them now?|!?  But everyone else knew they were ok to good players, not superstars."
So i can compare Jordan Clarkson to Kyrie? Because that's the gap. It's the same between Kyrie and clarkson as between kyrie and iverson
at least Jordan Clarkson could score
"1. conley, SS - good defender, will get on base, has never struck out in his entire career. great table setter  2. mitchell, CF - good speed and range, can hit for power as well  3. gobert, C - Big man with a huge bat, insane range defensively  4. bojan bogdanovic, DH - swings for the fences every time  5. joe ingles, LF - if bojan didnt bat them in joey vegemite will  6. jordan clarkson, RF - also swings for the fences every time  7. Georges Niang, 1B - hes in the league for his hitting, but also surprisingly decent defender for his position   8. royce oneale, 2B - good individual defender, not a huge offensive threat but he can make plays  9. derrick favors, 3b - quietly does the dirty work like a professional"
"Good quote. Honestly, I feel like he could easily be Jordan Clarkson right now in the right situation so he probably definitely wants to find a way to stay in Denver."

"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
His defense is super concerning.  It's so bad I don't know how he becomes anything but a supercharged version of Lou Williams or Jordan Clarkson with more athleticism if he doesn't get better on that end.
"Currently, 6th man of the year favorite (-1250 today on Draft Kings)  is other Utah Jazz stud, Jordan Clarkson.  Clarkson is a huge part of the reason that the Jazz have held the league's top record for virtually the entire season, as he provides them with a major scoring spark off of the bench. With a career-high average of 17.5 points per performance, Clarkson is Utah's second-leading scorer, despite the fact that he only plays 26 minutes per game. Only Donovan Mitchell (26.4 points per game) scores more than Clarkson for Utah.   That said. The NEXT odds favorite (+500) is Joe Ingles"
Like they did with Jordan Clarkson . He was basically told to shoot either really close shots or threes
for like 10 games Drummond was low-key good and seriously playing the best defense a Cavs big has played in some time   and then he just turned into the worst player on the court. dude was like 18/14 and he was making clutch steals and protecting the rim and even made some nice passes. then he just made every single player around him worse. it’s like if cavs era jae crowder and first year jordan clarkson had a baby
🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻 using that logic you can say jordan clarkson a BENCH player dropped 40 on simmons head stfu you just sound dumb
We talkin Jordan Clarkson or Jordan Poole here?
"People just saw the Clarkson is a lock takes all over early in the season, but he's fell off quite a bit since then, and his shooting splits are looking more like the old Jordan Clarkson before he came to Utah.   Ingles, Rose, and Brunson all have growing cases to be over him. I personally think Ingles should be the winner though."
Almost certainly Jordan Clarkson
"Cavs definitely had some brick layers, especially that last year he made the finals with them.   It was painful to watch guys like Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood clanging balls off of the rim over and over. Even Kyle Korver was struggling with his shot in the playoffs that year."
His purpose was to be trade bait for Jordan Clarkson it's all come full circle
"Oh you want to play this game ok. Let’s start off with Julius Randle, he’s averaging 24/10/6 on 46/42/80 splits and 57 TS% leading the knicks to the 4th seed currently.   D’Angelo Russell is averaging 19/2/5 on 42/38/78 splits and 55 TS%. He’s been unhealthy this year but he’s been a good secondary star to KAT.   Brandon Ingram is averaging 24/5/5 on 46/38/87 splits and 58 TS%. He’s not a good defender but he’s a great offensive player on a young pelicans team.   Lonzo Ball is averaging 14/4/5 on 42/37/78 splits and 55 TS%. He’s been playing like an elite role player this year and last year. He’s been getting better every year so there’s no reason to doubt he won’t get better.   Kuzma is averaging 12/6/1 on 43/46/68 splits and  54 TS%. He’s clearly taking. Complimentary role since AD arrived and I love that he’s accepted his role. He went from a good scorer to a role player who tries to do a little of everything. He’s a good team player.   Jordan Clarkson is averaging 17/4/2 on 41/34/92 splits and 54 TS% and is a main part of one of the best teams in the league  Larry Nance and Jason Hart and really good role players as well.   This sub said Russell, Lonzo and Ingram were bust but they’ve all turned out to be good players. Randle has even exceeded expectations and is playing phenomenal. Maybe we as fans of the team watch them play more and therefore we have a better understanding of how good a player can get.   You say Laker fans over value their young guys but show me a fan base who doesn’t."
I think his potential is about a Jordan Clarkson
"I hate to admit this but this always happen to Lebron's teammates. We've seen this many times before in Miami and Cleveland. It's not Lebron's fault though, it's his fans who are quick to hate on players who are having bad games. I mean right from the start we know what to expect from Drummond and now they're scrutinizing him. Remember what they also did to KCP, Danny Green, Jordan Clarkson etc."
Clarkson has the award in the bag but Ingles definitely deserves to be in the conversation and arguments can be made that his impact on the floor for the Jazz is even greater than Jordan. But 6MOY is pretty much an award for who scores the most off the bench really.
Jordan Clarkson used to be that level of inconsistent. Maybe Poole makes the same improvements in the coming years.
"Also for the Jazz Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanović. They're not the very top players on the Jazz but they are extremely important to their jump to the top of the West."
"HUM DIDDLY DEE ! Jordan Clarkson, HOW DO YOU DO ?"
"The best players on the best teams right now are Lebron KD Curry Harden AD Giannis Embiid Paul George Kawhi Lilliard Booker Gobert Jokic Middleton. Out of those names, 9/14 of them were drafted out of the top 5.  Out of the bottom third markets, the notable FA signings are   Hayward, Rozier to Charlotte  Conley to Jazz (was traded but got to choose where to be traded to),   Jordan Clarkson resigned (almost guaranteed 6th man of the year),  Gobert resigned (2x dpoy)  Spurs - LMA  Bucks - Resign Giannis, resign middleton, trade and resign jrue  okc - resigned PG but he left the next year so w/e  so most of the time they're not signing first team all-nba players in their prime, but they're resigning their all-nba draft picks and signing high level role players/low level all stars which is enough to compete if you draft well."
Jordan Clarkson is getting too much hype honestly.
only JC I fuck with is Jordan Clarkson
&gt; Other guys were having a good game.  ...were they tho? Bogs started white hot and then cooled to a ice cold. Jordan Clarkson was a train wreck. Ingles was a flopping mess. Mitchell was the only one who was able to safely handle the ball and get open for a shot without a turnover. Yeah his ankle is fucked but that’s just the natur of the beast. Sometimes you do your best and come up short.
They really need Jordan Clarkson to have another game 2 like performance.  But they may be asking too much
"Utah has GOT to do something about their bench. 2 points for the bench not named Jordan Clarkson, and it has been like that all series."

"With everyone dropping like flies, we’re on track to Jordan Clarkson being FMVP"
More injuries bro? At this rate Jordan Clarkson is going to win finals MVP.
FMVP jordan clarkson
"I hate Rudy gobert’s covid spreading, George Floyd conspiracy boosting, trying to flop for a tech literally on the bench lookin ass. I fucking hate gobert. I want to see him cry again. People compare this bitchmade bastard to Ben Wallace but that is downright insulting.   The players throwing shade for being under appreciated in the all star team selection when they haven’t accomplished anything in the playoffs is laughable. They think they’re great and that Jordan Clarkson is suddenly a championship quality player because they went hard AF in the regular season which saw teams devastated from covid protocols and injuries. Many teams clearly were prioritizing rest. If cp3 is out too, they very well may waltz into the finals and play exclusively teams which face massive injuries besides the 1st round against an 8 seed."
"I'm not really sure what prevented Jordan Crawford from being used full-time in a Jordan Clarkson-style role.   Jordan Crawford would always come in on these 10-day contracts for the Pels (in '17 &amp; '18) and shoot the lights out in garbage time. But he could just never turn it into an actual role with playing time.  He once won a Eastern Conference Player of the Week with Boston in 2013-14! Since then, he's only had those garbage time Pels runs, and he's probably past the end of the road at age 32 now.  You can't convince me his shot creation couldn't have helped some moribund offenses in the 2015-20 seasons."

"Kevin Love, Jordan Clarkson, Derrick Rose, and Jae Crowder lead by a GOAT is not a trash team. Just because they were misused by the Cavs doesn't make those players bad."
Jordan Clarkson would like to have some words
"The Bucks are obviously a very talented team that has the ability to dominate anyone. Just need to find the right coach to get that team to show up all of the time. Also some minor adjustments to their bench could do wonders. They could use a ""you miss every shot you don't take"" type of bench scorer (like a Jamal Crawford/Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson type)."
KDs shot just then is what Jordan Clarkson thinks is a good shot look
"Jordan Clarkson, Becky Hammon(d) and…*checks basketball reference*…Scott May?"
&gt;they settled for too many jumpshots  The Jordan Clarkson special
"Yes, why would Donovan shoot so much when Conleys hurt and Gobert and O’Neale are such offensive threats?! I mean why shoot when hes shooting well and can pass it to Jordan Clarkson who can launch with a hand in his face? 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"You are a clear Joel hater haha. Every damn thread.  ""Huge Jordan Clarkson"" is a new clueless take though. A for effort."

"He is worth Jordan Clarkson money. 4 years, 52 million."
Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan clarkson slapped the Euro off Zupac and made him Tupac.. carried on
"I'm one of those old guys usually scoffing at a lot of the flagrants we see today. But I felt this one tonight fit the bill in terms of intent. There's swiping in the vicinity of the ball and missing (sort of like Jordan Clarkson the other night) then there's swinging with intent, as Jokic appeared to be doing by way of the abnormal force behind that wind up.   As to whether it's a flagrant 1 or flagrant 2... the majority of the time since 1991 (when flagrant rules were initially reinvigorated), that probably would have been a flagrant 1. But under today's interpretation, Jokic probably checked two key boxes of a flagrant 2 (he intended to inflict significant contact and it occurred on the opponent's dome)."
Jordan Clarkson did some similar shit yesterday and got a Flagrant 1
"For context, literally last night Jordan Clarkson swung his arm and smacked Zubac right in the face during a rebound, but he was clearly going for the ball. There was wind up, and Clarkson didn’t even touch the ball. The refs took like 1 min to review and called it a flagrant 1, as everyone knew it was.   Jokic definitely deserved a flagrant 1, but not a flagrant 2. Probably doesn’t change the game, let alone the series, but that’s definitely a BS call. It’s definitely unnecessary, but he’s making a play on the ball."

"It still works, doesn't matter that he has no ""bag""  His bag is ""i'm 7 foot and fast and i will score on you"", that bag &gt; Jordan Clarkson who can score in every way for example  Giannis does need to stop chucking dumb threes and shoot better at the line though but he doesn't need a bag to be dominant"
"2018 Kevin Love is way better than anyone else on the Nets roster. They also had Jordan Clarkson, who's now 6moty."
Also Jordan Clarkson
"Its like Jordan Clarkson set up a bet ""Hey man, 10 bucks I can slap Zubac without him fighting me"""
Game 4 will be fascinating if the coaches can adjust. We got lucky too cause Jordan Clarkson had a bad game
Donovan Mitchell is a dangerous man.      So is Jordan Clarkson.
"&gt;Please…3 of those rings Mitch was along for the ride.  This is demonstrably not the case.  Kupchak was fully-empowered as the General Manager in the summer of 2000.  That means Kupchak:  * made the Horace Grant trade -- who started every playoff game in 2001 -- for Glen Rice, who was terrible the previous season * signed bench guys Medvedenko, Hunter, and Rider who all played a bunch of minutes * but most importantly by-far, managed to keep O'Neal and Jackson from either killing Bryant, or quitting in frustration over his truculence, or both.  He probably deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for the latter alone.  And previous to that, he was the GM in charge of most operations from 1995 through 2000.  More to the actual point, no GM makes every decision in a vacuum with zero input from ownership or Executive Vice Presidents -- which was West's title from '95 through 2000.  The fact remains that the Lakers won 6 titles with Kupchak as their GM, and five of those occurred after West was formally retired.  If you want to discount some of those early titles, you may have to add the 2020 ring in their place.  Kupchak was gone by then, but he laid much of the groundwork -- doing things like [refusing to trade Ingram for DeMarcus Cousins](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/sam-amick/2017/02/21/why-lakers-jeanie-buss-fired-jim-buss-mitch-kupchak/98223130/) and not trading away the picks that became Ball and Hunter in a misguided attempt to win with the aged Bryant, and trading cash for Jordan Clarkson (!!), and signing Lou Williams."
Plus Jordan Clarkson had to bust his ass to shed the empty stats label he was developing during his time with Cleveland.
"On the bright side between him and Zubac going full Yakkety Sax out there, and Jordan Clarkson absolutely slapping Zubac's shit while staring him directly in the face, the lost entertainment value from this game being a blowout was made up for by it being comedy gold"
"Jordan ""Kyle Kuzma"" Clarkson"
Jordan Clarkson does not fuck passing

I'm too lazy to check but I think Metta World Peace was also on it or maybe I'm thinking of 2016-17"
"They had the best offense in the league from the Jordan Clarkson trade to the league shutdown in March last season (their tanking to avoid Houston in the bubble dropped it to 3rd from the Clarkson trade to the end of the regular season), then they turbocharged their 3-point shooting in the playoffs to make up for Bojan being out. This year they continued that focus on taking tons of 3s and had Conley actually settle in and play well."
D'Angelo Russell   Jordan Clarkson   Kobe bryant   Luol deng   Roy Hibbert   Larry Nance JR   Tarik Black   Timofey Mozgov   Nick Young   Thomas Bryant   Julius Randle   I know I'm missing like 2-3 guys for sure
I'm going jazz this one. Donovan Mitchell playing like he should be the MVP. Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson both 6th men of the league. Rudy Gobert the DPOY. I don't see clips taking this one. They just don't have enough manpower to stop Mitchell and company.
"He’s not a bad player, he’s just also not the #1 player on a great team. He can be the 3rd best player on a team (maybe), but his score first mentality fits a Jordan clarkson, Terrence Ross role."
Jordan Clarkson is better.
Devin Booker  Jordan Clarkson Ben Simmons Blake Griffin  James Harden  Tristan Thompson Kris Humphries  You can fill the rest ;)
I think that's pretty fair except Jordan Clarkson isn't a chemistry problem for a locker room
"“Schröder can’t seem to escape the fact that, overall, he grades out as being an average guard. There isn’t any one area where he can consistently apply himself as being an elite conductor, nor is he really terrible at anything.  All that is to mean, his on-court value will always be heavily tied to his financial compensation.  Rejecting $84 million over four years, an annual salary of $21 million, seems at best curious. At worst, it’s a sign that Schröder views himself as a borderline All-Star, which he statistically is fairly far away from being.  Of course, the market will always determine value. If a team is willing to fork over $21 million a year, or even more, that will be Schröder’s value for better or worse.  But before a team does that, it stands to reason they take an honest look at what Schröder is, and what he isn’t. Based on numbers and prior production, Schröder is best suited for a role as a team’s offensive Sixth Man, or a spot-starter who ranks low on the offensive totem-pole.  That description doesn’t fit with a salary of $21 million per year. Instead, it fits with the contract of someone like Jordan Clarkson, who signed a four-year contract in November of 2020 worth $51 million.  Schröder, it appears, is seeking closer to twice that, if the rejection of $84 million is any indication. As such, it would behoove NBA teams to do their research before offering a contract that they very likely will come to regret just months later.”"

How many (straight) girls are we in this subs ? For having this discussion with my girl friends (because thats the only way they get interested in basketball) most common answers are :  - pretty boy Oubre JR - Serge Ibaka - Ben Simmons - Devin Booker - Jordan Clarkson - Rudy Gobert (that's the french pride) - Kevin Love -  Danilo Gallinari - JJ redick - Dlo - Dame - Beal  But big big hype on boys like Simmons Oubre and Booker they ar every popular (among my friends and women talk on the internet).
"People really hype up Ty right now because he made a lot of adjustments on a team and they went fairly far in the playoffs in spite of Kawhi tearing an ACL but in 2018 or so I was so frustrated with him for playing Jordan Clarkson for long stretches, Jordan never passing the ball, and the Cavs struggling when he was on the floor.  Sometimes the same coaches who people hype up also don’t make adjustments haha."
Is JC Jordan Clarkson?
Jordan Clarkson was born in Florida and raised in Texas
"My thing is he's so young. Guys like Kuzma, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, Jordan Clarkson etc, basically all our late round picks, those guys all played a long time in college. They were much older and closer to their peaks when they were drafted. THT is only 20. He's far away from even being in his prime yet which is why I have a lot of hope for him."
"League average TS for Lou Will's 51.3% TS was 54.4%, for a -3.1% rTS. For Sexton's 57.3% this year, league average was 57.2%, for a 0.1% rTS. I don't care about mealy-mouthed excuses about playstyles or whatever, we can compare relative to the league at the time and we'll see that Collin Sexton was and is better, period.  That's the thing with Sexton haters that I just don't understand. You keep saying he's a sixth man and you keep trying to put him in that role, but he's better than that. He's better than Lou Will, or Jamal Crawford, or Jordan Clarkson, or any of the other guys that perform amazing in a sixth man role but otherwise struggle as a starter. He's better than them by a fairly significant margin.  That's the issue. You don't think he gels well with Garland? Fine. You don't think he'd fit well with who we're likely to pick in the draft? Sure. But stop trying to make him out to be worse than he is. He's a very good young player that probably doesn't have superstar potential but, at 22, has already elevated himself to fringe all-star level and has shown the ability to take over games against the best teams in the league. He's worth more than Toppin Knox and a first."
Trading with blazers is such a no brainer.. with a win win on both sides. Ben with dame. Cj with embiid and Harris (Seth off the bench (Jordan clarkson role) with maxey starting.   Blazers will add assets as well.
"Dude likes A$AP Rocky, Blake Griffith, Jordan Clarkson, Ben Simmons, Harry Styles, Nick Jonas, Deangelo Russel, And Kyle Kuzmas sloppy seconds"
"Blazers v. Cavs at RoMoFiHo, November 2019. My two favorite teams battled hard (and worked through a collective 40% fg pct in the first half), but eventually the home team proved too much for the hobbled Blazers. Player of the game was now-6th-man-of-the-year Jordan Clarkson with a cool 28 for the Cavs. I bought a Kevin Love city edition jersey, and I regret not buying a Sexton jersey now, but those city kits were nice last year."

Tbf a Jordan Clarkson / Allan Caidic / Chip Engelland / Kai Sotto / Andray Blatche team isn't so bad. I think that's easily the third best FIBA Asia team after China and Australia
"I'll bite.  Jordan Clarkson, Andray Blatche, Jalen Green, Chip Engelland, pick any 8 players from the 2014 World Cup team."
Current day Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson
"this is not true. first of all derrick and dejounte can share the floor, they really complement each other in the best way possible, really, what one do not do, the other do it well. off the bench the bench we have lonnie walker who yes has defensive issues but he played alongside demar and often as a wing which he absolutely is not so he wasn't in a really good situation to defend, plus in general he's not that great. patty mills might leave and go to a contender while he fully go youth movement, win-win situation for both us and him. so we would have tre jones in development who showed really positive flashes, and we could sign a pg just in case too. we do not have five point guards, we are in a right situation in terms of guards, just no need to add more espeically considering how weak our frontcourt is.  i'll also add some other things from a post i did like more than a month ago about our situation, you can read it all if you want [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Let's begin by stating the versatily of the players. DJ is a pure PG, same goes with Tre. Derrick White is gonna start at SG, but he would have zero issues to play the PG  alongside Lonnie who on the other hand could slide at 1 for a small amount of time, but he is definitely a Pure 2 and not a 3 AT ALL, this season showed us this. Keldon is a full-time 3 but he can easily slide at 4 in a small-ball situation. About Devin I would say that he definitely need to play the 3 as his preferred position, he has all the tools to do so, and a solid summer in the gym would define it; he can slide at 2 regardless. DJ-DW Backcourt is really deadly. DJ proved this season that he is arguable the best player on the court without DeMar. And guess who is the other dude that is arguable the best player after DeMar? Derrick White. So yeah, a starting backcourt of this two is obvious and worked amazing when they were both fully healthy. I would play DJ and DW around 30+mins, maybe Derrick a couple of minutes more since he's more versatile. Off the bench Lonnie should definitely be our go-to-guy, our 6-Man. uly him more around 20-25m, limayeb slide him at 1 if necessary. Tre ones is also a really good fit with him, he needs a true PG like him that repares the play for him, they complement each other. The point is that Tre is not that ready, but he has to play, for sure, I would play him around 10-15m, but he can easily see his minutes go up if he keeps doing well! Devin at 3, maybe at 2 if needed, would be really good, a 3&amp;D guy like him is really amazing, I would play around just below 20mins. On defense our true liability is Lonnie, but he would find Tre and Devin, both elite defender, on the perimeter helping him so he can focus on his man and Lonnie showed he can be even above average if he focus on 1v1, imagine with an offseason of work.  also a ""small"" review on their season:  DEJOUNTE MURRAY  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  DERRICK WHITE  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  LONNIE WALKER IV  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him? I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  DEVIN VASSELL  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season"
"he's like jordan clarkson in that respect, but more talented. he's overplaying himself in this star role"
they treat him like when Jordan Clarkson was on the lakers. It's not suprising how jordan clarkson turned into the 6th man of the year.
Middleton will have his 5-10 minute MJ streak and then revert back to Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson scored 30+ points 5 times this past year.  The year before that he did it twice.
If they draft Green he will play 6th man as a rookie and get like Jordan Clarkson minutes
Accept you're a vet min guy who's role will never be overly consistent. Go spend a weekend with Jordan Clarkson and figure out how he escaped the deep dark hole.
"Look at Jordan Clarkson, his role is clearly defined and he is thriving"
He's not wrong.  But the tough thing for Kuzma is that his best role is to be the 2nd leading scorer on a bad team. I don't mean that as shade. His best outcome is to become a taller Jordan Clarkson/Lou Williams 6th man scoring type.
"The framing of this is weird lol. We were invested in our young players. BI, Lonzo, and Kuz all looked like developing and promising players. Kuz was a huge surprise to people being a late 1st round pick. We also hit on other players like Jordan Clarkson. Then we signed LeBron and shifted into win-now mode. What's the issue?"
"&gt; ""A player like him"". 6th man volume, needs ball. Forward version of Lou Will, Jordan Clarkson. Kind of like Lamar Odom during the Lakers' championship run, but with less finesse.  Odom was nothing like Clarkson or Lou, and he was much much better than Kuzma.  Even in Kuzma's higher volume years, he's never shown a consistent ability to create his own shot. The vast majority of his FGs were assisted, and he can't get to the FT line."
"He's definitely above average in cutting (offball movement towards the basket on stale offense, of which the Lakers have too much of) and defense. People are still hesitant to give him a pass on defense for some reason. When we saw him be hunted by the likes of Harden and Westbrook and shut them down multiple possessions, even back to back ones. Kuzma is not a hole in the defense anymore, and is actually a net positive above average.      But just take a look at his first two years, his showcase years. He was a ball dominant scorer out of triple threat. Even his first year with LeBron, he was in the majority of the two-man plays PnR with LeBron. IIRC he posted top ""synergy stats"" (if those even mean anything) with LeBron in the PnR.      He's proven to be very not good at catch and shoot, and needs the ball to be ""good."" I think he should strive to be like JC in Utah before trying to make the case for him to be given more. His agent needs to look for that type of role for him. The problem is this last year in the league is gonna hurt his chances of that pretty awfully.      ""A player like him"". 6th man volume, needs ball. Forward version of Lou Will, Jordan Clarkson. Kind of like Lamar Odom during the Lakers' championship run, but with less finesse. Odom had dribble moves and the IQ to run Point. Kuzma doesn't have those yet, if he ever will.      If I were in his shoes, I would try to develop handles next. You can't have that 6th man volume if you can't at least dribble at a good level. His handling is definitely under average."
"The Lakers development team sucks. Players leave the Lakers and always seem to get better. For example, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, Deangelo Russel, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson…"
Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle
"&gt;How did Clarkson, Hood and Crowder play with LeBron? Of yeah those guys suck right?  Yes. Role players especially go up and down dramatically. Crowder wasn't good on the Cavs but he wasn't good on the Jazz and Grizzlies either. Was that Lebron's fault too? Crowder started shooting much better in Miami and now Phoenix. That's just how it goes for role players.  Rodney Hood has always been Rodney Hood don't act like he's good now. He averaged 4 points for Toronto this year. Utah traded him for good reason.  Jordan Clarkson is a good bench player and was good for the Cavs in the regular season. He just got the yips in his first postseason. He's learned and improved."
"the fact that you pulled that up in less than 5 minutes is very weird.   here in recent years trez, drummond, george hill, jae crowder, IT, jordan clarkson to name a few guys that had some of their worst seasons playing with leracist."
And the turns into Jordan Clarkson at other times.
Even Jordan Clarkson averaged 2.5 assists per game this season. You know it's a problem when your tunnel vision is even worse than Clarkson.
"A lot of those any 6th man of the year or similar type scorer guy is like this. Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, etc. Iguodala left his scoring ways but on the warriors he would always miss gimmes, but he was on fire on clutch or heavily guarded plays"
"not saying it's going to turn out the same way, but everyone forgets that the way people are shitting on kuz is the same exact way people shat on jordan clarkson"
Free Jordan Clarkson??
Did you just compare Jokic to Ayton? It's like comparing Jordan Clarkson to Curry.
Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson?
"Kuzma’s game doesn’t fit well with Lebron and AD. His growth is also stunted on the Lakers. If he gets traded, he might be able to improve like Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball."
Jordan Clarkson could have been that guy
"He needs to be more consistent but he plays just like James Harden and has shown the ability to be quite the playmaker. As a Rockets fan who watched every game this season his ceiling Is James Harden and floor I would say something similar to Jordan Clarkson. He has a knack for taking tough/contested shots that are sometimes unnecessary;but that is expected of a young player suddenly thrusted into a primary ball handler role. The Rockets Reddit is leaning Green and personally that would make a dangerous backcourt. Mobley would also help in the pick and roll and overall spacing if he could develop his three. His swing factor, like most players these days is his 3 point shooting. Some games he looked like James harden in the flesh and in others it was clear the ball wasn’t going to be falling for him. Like Harden, his body language can be very revealing of his performance."
"You said hes capable of playing like them which I still disagree with because he's not nearly the playmaker that they were and the playstyles aren't even similar. I've also seen a lot of Lakers Clarkson so I'm not just referring to his time with Utah.  Age and physical tools give you a higher ceiling because of the perceived potential there. If a player does similar things but is taller, more athletic, and younger, then I think it make sense that they're ceiling is higher.  I like Jordan Clarkson but what has he shown that makes him a good playmaker and rebounder? I never really saw anything like that. Wiggins is a better scorer and rebounder or at least comparable to Clarkson. Clarkson is hands down a better playmaker but they have different roles and he's not an especially good one."
Remember when Kobe told Jordan Clarkson to stop going to the hole like a light skinned dude. I'll just leave it at that..
No Jordan Clarkson for Philippines.
"Jordan clarkson&gt;&gt;&gt;  Shit goes hard with everything: skin fade, braids, edgar cut, waves, fro. 6MOY with top 5 hairline"
Coming off the bench and playing limited minutes is a big adjustment. You're coming into the game cold while everyone has already been playing at full game speed. It's not easy to be consistent with those type of circumstances since you pretty much can't play Trae and Lou at the same time ever and you'll want Trae playing more. There's also the mentality of being trusted as the primary ball handler and driving force of the team vs a 6th man gunner. Lou's a pretty good ball handler and smart with his decision making at a playmaker and knowing how to control the pace with drawing fouls. Jordan Clarkson is a good example of this. He looked like a very competent ball handler and starting PG his rookie year with the Lakers and ever since he became a 6th man he's been a straight tunnel visioned gunner since there's not the same level of expectation to share the ball and in general the lack of offensive weapons to pass to.
"Who would have thought, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson being the best microwaves these playoffs.  Every contender needs a microwave on the bench, someone who can get hot all of a sudden to help carry missing offense, or to break a game wide-open into a blowout, turning an 8 point lead, into an 18 point lead with your starters sitting."
Jordan Clarkson is dollar store Kobe so...
Is Cam Reddish Walmart Jordan Clarkson?
"That's a bigger IF than Bobi lmao.  But yeah I think the coach wants him on the team. But given they run a very motion-centric Euro style offense JC will have to make a huge adjustment because this coach hates hero ball  If he does buy in then yeah  The FIBA Asia Cup (with Australia and New Zealand) is where we'll probably see him next, that's happening in August. But I think JC wants to join in the World Cup in 2023  Plus there's FIBA politics since JC didn't get his passport until he was over 16 which FIBA doesn't allow for ""local"" players  [https://www.spin.ph/basketball/fiba/tab-baldwin-wants-jordan-clarkson-in-fiba-world-cup-whether-as-local-or-naturalized-player-a795-20210514](https://www.spin.ph/basketball/fiba/tab-baldwin-wants-jordan-clarkson-in-fiba-world-cup-whether-as-local-or-naturalized-player-a795-20210514)"
It's really just the 4 all stars and maybe Clarkson depending on how you see him vs Wiggins. All 6 are also the 6 with the most career points scored in the draft.  Highest career scorers of the 2014 draft  Wiggins 10263 (525 games)  Nikola Jokic 8360 (453 games)  Jordan Clarkson 7950 (521 games)  Zach LaVine 7831 (411 games)  Julius Randle 7744 (446 games)  Joel Embiid 6456 (250 games)
"I didn’t say he had to groom every single player. Who on earth has done that? Jordan even had Pippen. He also needed a coach for those seasons, are you going to somehow twist that into the conversation?   Fact is he stuck around and learned out to play with and utilize those guys. Not once, but twice. And he’ll, even stuck around the years after and taught the next generation a thing or two. Clarkson, Ingram, Randal, Nick Young, Kuzma, D’angelo Russel.  Kobe’s whole philosophy became teaching others to love the game and to be their best."
Here I’ll do it with out including a player being paid more than 20 mil AAV besides Ben and no rookies sound fair?   PG: Dejounte Murray - 16 Mil AAV  SG: Norman Powell - 10.4 AAV  SF: TJ Warren - 11.7 AAV  PF: Christian Wood - 13.6 AAV  C: Ben Simmons  6th Man: Jordan Clarkson - 12.8 AAV  Backup Center for Point Simmons: Serge Ibaka - 9.4 AAV
"No Serge Ibaka (Season ending back surgery)  Joe Ingles finishing 2nd beside (Jordan Clarkson) for 6th man of the year.  List can go on and on.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz has accomplish nothing in their franchise history but my word do you guys talk so much shit just cause you got the 1st seed this season.  (To be fair the Clippers haven't done shit since it's entire existence as well)  But to go out and say I'm a Ignorant rebranded Lakers fan, when you can't even look at the other side of the argument and just go with  ""Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley is injured reason why we lost"" ""You're ignorant AF""  Get out of here with that weak petty shit.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz fan have the same mentality as their roster.  They just give up and fold and just look for the easiest excuse."
"Hell yeah, Jordan Clarkson = Senary Man of the Year"
We also want Jordan Clarkson and Mitchell
For regular season I agree. Playoffs though Dante has won the jazz some games. The jazz also had a better Jordan Clarkson when we had Burks but Quinn hated him for some reason. Quinn is the most overrated coach in the league
"Isn't Nigel Williams-Goss some guy they drafted with a second round pick that they fucking bought? Lmao.  Exum's value to the team was salary match in a Jordan Clarkson trade. Bust.  Also it's not 2000 anymore you don't start 2 bigs in a lineup. I don't know what the hell happened to Derrick Favors - was one of the better backup centers in the league, got traded to NOLA and sucked then came BACK to the team that traded him to be a full-time bench guy that got murdered in the playoffs."
"Dennis Lindsey also traded for Jordan Clarkson and drafted Donovan Mitchell...but yea, burn his ass down"
Jordan Clarkson isn't white
Surprised no Jordan Clarkson for Philippines.
"I just realized how old the Jazz' supporting players are.  Bogdanovic-32  O'Neale-28  Ingles-33  Derrick Favors---29, but he seems older.  Even Jordan Clarkson is 29."
"Clarkson and Rubio aren’t comparable players in that way. Jordan is a gunner who takes a lot of tough 3s, and if he’s missing it’s a bad day for him. Rubio takes basically only wide open 3s and still struggles to convert. Defenses will ignore him, not to the same extent of Simmons but still plenty enough to mess up our spacing."
It's about as informative as saying Derrick Favors and Jordan Clarkson don't like each other.
Yes. At the time. Eric Gordon was seen as a future all star. Maybe a Shai Gilgegous Level or Jamal Murray. Al Farooq was a young athlete and Kaman a solid vet former all star on an expiring.  The Lakers deal had Lamar who was a role player. Albeit a cool notable one. Scola. A solid role player. Kevin Martin who was maybe at best Jordan Clarkson level guy....and Dragic who was maybe thought of like Luke Kennard at the time. Eric Gordon and Al Farooq seemed like way higher potential players.
Jordan Clarkson too
"He should be in a Jordan Clarkson role off the bench on a good team, and if you sign a point guard, he'd be able to do that."
Jordan Clarkson being an hm for you guys surprised me lol any insight as to why him?
Does Jordan Clarkson count? IIRC he's born and raised in the US but has Filipino roots so I'm gonna say him
No. He was a star player who happened to come off the bench as it was determined this was the optimal role for the success of the team. It set a precedent for other players too. I believe Jamal Crawford is one who referenced Manu as a reason he decided to embrace a sixth man role later in his career. Jordan Clarkson this year especially embraced it.
“Donovan Mitchell jealous of the star treatment shown to Jordan Clarkson for receiving 6MOTY. Demands to be traded to Clarkson’s former team to be Lakers’ sixth man.”
"Once Jordan Clarkson reaches lv 36, he evolves into Bobby Portis"
"Exactly. He's a younger and better Jordan Clarkson imo. Good scoring option but will get exposed on defence due to small size. Still, Shoot like Clarkson, defend like Pat B isn't a bad combo to have, it's just not max worthy."
"Literally nobody else except for Mike James can create their own shot on the Hospital-edition Nets during the Bucks series...I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Jeff Green, or Blake Griffin dribbling the ball in their hands the way shot creators would to find their shots. The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  At least for the Jazz, an on-and-off Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and even Joe Inglés can kinda create their own shot, the other Nets played as the beneficiaries of playmakers like Harden and him being hobbled showed consequences on the court"
"""Y'all know how we have dogs and stuff right? So I think it was bigger people in the world before us, and the dinosaurs was they pets."" - Jordan Clarkson"
The Jordan Clarkson special
"I think our real problem is attracting talent.  Post-Hibbert PG13 Pacers could have been great. Instead it was a team with Monta Ellis as the 2nd option  2015 FA (some were restricted I think):  Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love, Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Brook Lopez, Danny Green, Khris Middleton, Reggie Jackson (PG13's long time friend and aspiring teammate), Rondo   2016 FA: KD, Conley, Horford, Derozan, Whiteside, Howard, Batum, Beal, Barnes, Bazemore, Gasol, Jordan Clarkson, Eric Gordon     We also traded a first round pick and still landed on a lineup of:  Teague  Monta Ellis   Paul George  Thad Young  Myles Turner (20 y/o)  w/ either Lance Stephenson, CJ Miles, or Rodney Stuckey as our 6th man  --------------  This is why I don't harbor resentment towards PG13. He asked for help and we did fuck all. And, while I think that is more because the market than the FO, not every player can be expected to be Reggie and stick it out through thick and thin. He's from Cali, wants to win or play in Cali or both, fine. We don't offer winning, well, it's done for.   But I think our mediocrity has little to do with it. While the Hawks and Suns did fantastically tanking in our time since PG13 the Pistons, Knicks, Magic, Kings, and more have seen little reward for it."
"Jordan Clarkson won 6MOY, Miles Bridges had a breakout year, Lonzo had a career year, Anthony Edwards proved to be pretty good, THT is likely to get paid by somebody, Garland had an impressive second year, Draymond at least had a bounce back year.  And don't forget about MAXEY!"
Yup. Like a Jordan Clarkson.
I also think if they have a better than Sexton at the same position they can have Sexton off the bench. They could use him in the role Jordan Clarkson is in. If they want to compete they would need a bench scorer.
"I said it, I was excited to see somewhere I've never been. Would I live there? Probably not willingly.  Seeing Jordan Clarkson destroy the Blazers was well worth the trip."
i don’t see how Jordan clarkson is any different lol
"The Bucks were offering a much better package to the Cavs and yet these guys took the Celtics offer, still pissed about that.  It was basically anyone but Giannis.  Malcolm Brogdon - highly valued at the time.  Khris Middleton - highly valued too.  Thon Maker - highly valued.  Jabari Parker - highly valued.  Picks - highly valued.  These guys really rejected whatever combination of that for what turned out to be Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood &amp; George Hill (top 10 pick too).   Collin Sexton makes it worth but still, why not take the Bucks package."
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
he can be a Jordan Clarkson type player. a good sixth man that can hit difficult shots is always going to be valued in this league for obvious reasons. gary just needs to be more consistent and try more on defence but he’s young and has had the opportunity to learn from guys like dame and melo. he’ll be great in his prime.
"There’s sooo many great ones honestly, but two of my favorites that haven’t been mentioned in the thread yet are:   &gt; Clippers meeting with Durant was “intense” and “at one point Steve Ballmer was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned  &gt; Kevin Love was confused when he didn’t see Jordan Clarkson run onto the court moments before tipoff Monday night. Then Love saw teammate Tristan Thompson, who was lagging behind. Thompson said one word to Love. “Utah”."
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
D’Angelo Russell  Jordan Clarkson  Devin Booker  Kyle Kuzma  Blake Griffin
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"
"Sure, but are you *really* going to say that ankle was the main reason you lost the series when all of the following happened **post-Kawhi injury**? (Keep in mind that I haven’t even included Conley’s horrid game 6 because he, too, was returning from injury.)   #**Game 5 :**   Marcus Morris Sr. : 25 pts, 10/16 shooting (3/4 from 3)  Reggie Jackson : 22 pts, 8/15 shooting (3/8 from 3)   Jordan Clarkson (second half) : 1 pt, 0/6 shooting (0/4 from 3)  Royce O’Neale (second half) : 4 pts, 1/7 shooting (0/5 from 3), 4 PF, -14 in 20:14  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 10/29 from the field (34.5%), 2/15 from 3 (13.3%)  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats included) : 13/43 from the field (30.2%), 3/24 from 3 (12.5%)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 14/21 from the FT line (66.7%), 10 AST, 12 TO (AST:TO = 0.83), 18 pts off TO  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats included) : 19/27 from the FT line (70.4%), 15 AST, 14 TO (AST:TO = 1.07), 20 pts off TO   #**Game 6 :**   Terance Mann (second career playoff start) : 39 pts, 15/21 shooting (7/10 from 3)  Reggie Jackson : 27 pts, 10/16 shooting (3/7 from 3), 3 stl  Los Angeles Clippers (second half) : 30/42 from the field (71.4%), 14/19 from 3 (73.7%)   Rudy Gobert (second half) : 6 pts, 2/2 shooting (0/0 from 3), 6 reb, 3 PF, 2 TO, -34 in 24:00  Rudy Gobert (full game) : 12 pts, 5/6 shooting (0/0 from 3), 10 reb, 2 stl, 5 PF, 3 TO, -24 in 42:08  Jordan Clarkson (second half) : 0 pts, 0/4 shooting (0/3 from 3), -25 in 10:42  Joe Ingles (3rd quarter) - 0 pts, 0/2 shooting (0/2 from 3), 2 AST, -17 in 06:18  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 11/26 from the field (42.3%), 5/17 from 3 (29.4%), 5 AST, 10 TO (AST:TO = 0.5)  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats included) : 15/39 from the field (38.5%), 9/25 from 3 (36.0%), 10 AST, 11 TO (AST:TO = 0.91)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 27 pts conceded off TO, 8/10 from the FT line (80%), 10 AST, 14 TO (AST:TO = 0.71)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats included) 29 pts conceded off TO, 14/19 from the FT line (73.7%), 19 AST, 16 TO (AST:TO = 1.19)  Biggest lead : Utah Jazz (25, 11:36 left in 3Q)   Given all of that, are you really still gonna sit here and say that the main reason you lost the series was because of an ankle injury to a guy who **averaged 30/7/7 over the last 2 games anyway**? Y’all didn’t lose because of that - **y’all lost because the team played like shit**."
"i’ll take the huge sample size. or i can watch the Nets game where YB took over. or when he went 3 on 5 in college    look: Murray plays with the best passing big man to ever live. his team is arguably the deepest in the league.   Sexton plays with JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, and Andre Drummond and he still makes more shots than Murray on more attempts.    he’s one of the 5 fastest players in the league and he just upped his free throws to 6 a game at 22 years old.   Murray isn’t even close to that level of consistency.   especially on a team with no other all-stars, a guy like Sexton would be a better fit than Murray. although I would put Morant over both personally"
Because you guys want a Jordan Clarkson on a max contract.
Why would the Jazz trade Jordan Clarkson for a player who could be Jordan Clarkson if they put in the work
Throw in Jordan Clarkson as well.
Dlo is closer to jordan clarkson than booker lmao.  It was clear even before this last season. [2017-2020 RAPM](https://i.imgur.com/YMY9PDJ.png)   And here is last season only [RAPM](https://i.imgur.com/UuOJg7s.png). I don't care much for guard defensive RAPM on bad team defenses but dude straight isn't very good on offense.
Jordan Clarkson is still there bruh
Donovan Mitchell  Rudy Gobert  Jordan Clarkson  Royce O'neale
I think we straight up bought Jordan Clarkson from the Wizards (basically) lol
Could end up a 6MOY like Jordan Clarkson
"Cause by most stats he is the greatest modern day collegiate chucker. In regards to lack of ball movement, usage, taking difficult shots, and inefficiency combined. And it wasn't cause his teammates were bad either.  But I agree, you still draft a guy like that. He would most assuredly improve his efficiency as time goes on. At worst, he ends up just being a bench assassin like Jordan Clarkson."
Isaiah  Thomas did it just fine at 5’8. I think his ceiling is Zach Lavine and floor is Jordan Clarkson
"&gt; He played 38 mins a game that playoffs.  It was a wrist injury lol. That doesn't affect your cardio or ability to move.  &gt; You keep mentioning how Wall was better than Lowry  Of course he was. Because of the injury.  &gt; Oh no let’s do like you though and minimize it to just “1 ppg and 3 apg” as if any real objective basketball fan would use an argument so basic. Hey Our New PG Dennis Schröder only averaged 2 ppg and 3 apg less than Lowry last season guess there isn’t a huge jump in how good they are compared to each other lol.  You're the one minimizing it to just two stats. Lowry beats him by every advanced metric and was a significantly better defender. You're completely right that Lowry scoring just 2ppg and 3apg more than Schroeder doesn't show the whole picture, you have to look at *all* of the stats. Was Colin Sexton better than Chris Paul because he averaged more ppg this year? Oh and Jonas Valanciunas is better than Rudy Gobert. And don't forget that Jordan Clarkson is way better than Dejounte Murray.   Or do we need to look at more than just minimal differences in base box stats to evaluate a player?  Honestly at this point I'm not exactly sure if you understand how efficiency works. 1ppg is, quite literally, meaningless without looking at efficiency. But if that's your reason for Wall being better then you do you.  &gt; Wall was better in the regular season  So... Lowry leads him in every advanced stat and had Curry level efficiency and was one of the best floor spacers in the league... but Wall got 1 more ppg so he was way better lmao. Got it.  &gt; Would love to hear what you think Lowry could’ve been if he hadn’t been “hurt” throughout his prime though. Maybe a couple of 1st team all nbas? An MVP? Scoring titles? Surely in contention for goat right?  Lol come on now. Let's just have a mature debate about this without strawmanning. Personally I think Lowry had an argument for one more all nba third team in 2016 though, but it's debatable."
"Maybe I'm wrong, but what's going to set him apart from being just another Nick Young or Jordan Crawford type player? Or, more relevant to Nets fans, another MarShon Brooks?  Like it seems the absolute ceiling is a Lou Will or recent Jordan Clarkson type. Those are/were definitely good players, but not anything special, especially not in a playoff setting."
Jordan Clarkson comp.
Jordan Clarkson
Good luck convincing Jordan Clarkson of that....  Fun fact: JC is a better career 3 point shooter than Kobe..
"I don’t think Jordan Clarkson belongs in any category with Kobe, Lebron, KD, Steph, Dirk, and Giannis lol"
Luka-Danny Green-Mikal Bridges-OG Anunoby-Myles Turner  Bench: Thad Young-Jordan Clarkson-Richaun Holmes-Jalen Brunson-Otto Porter
Jordan Clarkson
Most underrated - SGA/Clint Capela Most overrated - Probably Jordan Clarkson.
"Honestly he wasn’t that great even without the injuries. He scored 20 a game that one season but a) we were a .500 team and b) he was terrible at everything else. Had some attitude issues too, although that was under Kidd so who knows if he’d have got himself together under a non-psychopath.   Certainly could have been more than the fringe NBA player he is now (6MOY candidate maybe, like a wing Lou Will/Jordan Clarkson) but I don’t think he was ever going to be a star, just didn’t have the non-scoring skill set or the attitude."
"I stopped listening to his previous Podcast years ago when he said he wasn't entirely convinced that dinosaurs existed. This came after Kyrie's flat earth, and Jordan Clarkson thinking that dinosaurs were pets, of human beings the size of giants  I just couldn't listen to players podcasts anymore."
"Not like LAL can develop talent to save their lives anyway...  Outside of Caruso, and *maybe* KCP, what players drafted by the Lakers have actually blossomed there?  Julius Randle - After leaving LA, he gets huge MIP noise, and even some MVP discussion after leading NYK back to the Playoffs.  D'Angelo Russell - After leaving LA, he becomes one of the centerpieces of a young Brooklyn team that made it back to the Playoffs after a decent absence.  Jordan Clarkson - After leaving LA, he wins 6MOTY on UTAH, is instrumental in putting The Jazz in the position to make the (admittedly disappointing) post-season run they did.  Lonzo Ball - Has greatly improved his shooting to become one of the more coveted 3&amp;D guys on the market (4yrs, 85mil coveted).  Brandon Ingram - Turns into KD-lite, shows flashes on Tatum-level ability. Very impressive young guy.  Point is, even without Lebron not allowing some of these guys the chance to grow, which of them were even likely to grow when The Lakers talent development is such booty?  Leaving the team seems to have worked out better for many of them in terms of improving their individual game."
"Also, Devin Booker is 1/4 Mexican.  I get what you mean though. As a Filipino-American, the only Filipinos currently in the NBA are Jordan Clarkson (1/4) and now Jalen Green (1/8). Representation matters."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap.

Nick Young post Kobe.   What made that team so horrible is Julius was hurt in the first hame and there wasn't even a young guy to root for until the unknown Jordan Clarkson came on late in the year.
Jordan clarkson esque is my guess
"jordan clarkson is in the ""fully tattooed"" club as well"
Jalen Green will become the new Jordan Clarkson.
"u/19evol61 :   &gt; Player A: 14/3/3 statline with 44/37/82 shooting his whole career, plays sub-par defense, poor court vision Player B: 14/3/3 statline with 44/34/81 shooting his whole career, plays sub-par defense, poor court vision  &gt;The other player gets high praise with his work ethic and upside blah blah despite his injury history, and despite only having higher PPG due to his inefficient volume shooting. Gets $78m for 4 years.  &gt;The other is condemned by the NBA public for his apparently horrendous basketball play, has no risk of injury history, but his $50m/4y contract is considered an albatross.  &gt;One player is Zach Lavine, the other is Jordan Clarkson.  &gt;Bulls have lost this one."
"https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/08/27/18/asian-games-south-korea-knocks-out-jordan-clarkson-philippines  It's the Asian Games, not the FIBA Asia Championship, but it is still important. I think this may have been the competition Son from Tottenham won in South Korea 🇰🇷 that allowed him to not have to serve in the military."
"Jordan Clarkson did play for the Philippines already, but I forget the tournament."
"Oh boy, full of dumbasses in this thread.  Where do I even start, the Bulls fans who say that he will be injured forever, the Kings fans thinking that they've overpaid him, one guy that called Jordan Clarkson better with blind stats..."
"Nah, I just think it's hilarious that everyone's always, ""Only Kobe could do that, man! 60 points to end it!"" on 44% shooting for the night from the field when you take 40 more shots than the next closest guys on your team. He was shooting about the same percent as DLo, who took 10 shots, while Jordan Clarkson hit 60% of his 10 shots. But you're right, taking crappy contested shots while your teammates watch is the true Kobe mentality."
"Ah yes, the storybook in which the main character takes 50 shots, going 6/21 from 3, and getting outrebounded by his go-to big, Jordan Clarkson."
josh christopher is gonna have a long career as a jordan clarkson type sixth man
"A full strength Cameroon, The Bahamas, and DR Congo would definitely have a good chance of making it. They all have some good NBA players, and some of them have very good Euroleague players as well. But, without the chance to use them, of course they won't make it. For the Philippines, you're correct outside of a few years here and there. But, now they have Jordan Clarkson. So, the point being is that if they had to go through qualifiers, they would be extremely limited in their potential. A lot of the countries who got through merely got through because they could use their A team against everyone's B team. I don't really think that should be a knock on Slovenia or Latvia. If these two couldn't beat the other nation's B team, then I could see the knock on them, but they were playing their A teams."
Jordan Clarkson + Kyle Kuzma  /thread
"As long as they are winning Gold it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, also Team USA isn't sending their best players every time, which hurts them when international talent keeps getting better.  If Team USA had sent Dame, Harden, LeBron, KD and AD they would've won every single game by 30+ points regardless of any fit concern or the fact that you have multiple players that need the ball.  IT's problem is that he is a specialist, he needs certain circumstances in order to be a great player (ball in his hands, get hid on defense), but teams are not willing to give him this role (a Jordan Clarkson role) because he has failed in his role in this role three times in the last four years. His body has betrayed him, he can't do what Jordan Clarkson does despite the fact that five years ago, he way better than Clarkson will ever be."
"Reddit sometimes baffles me. Yeah, why doesn't IT just adapt to a completely different style that he has never played before in his life, going away from the style that actually made him an NBA player to begin with, so egotistical!  Isaiah Thomas is not a 3 and D guy and he's not a spot up shooter, the reason he is an NBA player is due to what he can do with the ball in his hands, if you remove the ball from his hands he is not an NBA player, therefore changing his ""style"" wouldn't land him a spot in the league.  IT's role in an NBA team is to be a Jordan Clarkson, but his body has deteriorated to the point that the last three teams that tried having him on this role (Lakers, Nuggets, Pelicans) all gave up on him after a dozen games."
"It was assuming you consider Schroeder as a starting caliber guard. Which he was for the entire season barring the playoffs.  The rate for starting caliber guards is around 20m, see what Robinson, FVV, Brogdon, Norman Powell, all make.   Bench players however cap out around 15m or so, Jordan Clarkson money.   I agree you dodged a bullet, but that is more due to the locker room issues that Schroeder seems to have brought to the Lakers this season. The reason he didn't get that money from other teams is that this offseason there were a TON of guards on the market who were clearly better than Schroeder, at a similar price point. Guys like Derozan, Norman Powell, Lonzo Ball, Conley, Dinwiddie, GTJ. Teams spent money on those guys and that left little to no money for Schroeder from the teams that needed guards, while the teams that didn't need guards didn't go after him anyways as their money was better spent elsewhere."
"He's making my countrymen proud. Jordan Clarkson is still loved, but Jalen Green is on another level."
people saying he reminds them of Jordan Clarkson is lol. clear they've never watched clarkson play ball in his early days
People all over this thread are trolling hard. Saw one earlier that said Green's ceiling is Jordan Clarkson.
Greens ceiling is Jordan Clarkson.
Yeah me too. I felt bad for him when he was saying that he struggled to be consistent in an inconsistent role. I’m looking forward to a Jordan Clarkson-esque return to form for Kuz
Jordan Clarkson is an integral piece to the Jazz and just won 6MOTY. Lonzo is now a centerpiece on the Bulls and is amazing on defense+improved his 3 point shooting to the point he’s considered a good shooter. Zubac had great games in the playoffs and waa getting a good chunk of minutes in the playoffs. Thomas Bryant is also good what the hell? Every player I listed is a good/decent role player. Watch some basketball bro and I guarantee you’ll learn more.   THT is also only 20 years old. Younger than a lot of the guys who got drafted and has a 7’1 wingspan on a 6’4 body. There’s a reason why he got the pay that he got this off-season. He’s shown flashes of greatness and is incredible for someone his age. I don’t even know if you’re trolling but I feel like I took the bait 😭
"Jordan Clarkson, Julius randle, Larry Nance Jr, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, d’Angelo, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant have all turned out decent to amazing. You’re just talking out of your ass 😂"
Yeah I think a lot of teams could use him. He just has to accept he is more of a Jordan Clarkson than Trae Young or whoever he thinks he is comparable to
"Dear Dennis:  *You’re a helluva ball player. You should have won 6MOTY last year, and that’s quite an accomplishment. That being said, look at what 6MOTY level talent pays. Jordan Clarkson gets 13M per. Montrez is on a 2/18. Take the money Dennis. This will ensure you are set for life. Play the game you love, and secure the bag.*  Real fuckin easy. Now give me 5% cut or whatever an agent makes"
"I think they're merging his personality and his ability to reflect that.  If they sign him as a 6man and first guard off the bench and he's acting like a diva chucking shots like Jordan Clarkson, auditioning for his next contract, they're not going to want him on their team cause they think he won't contribute to winning."
"&gt;I'm not sure saying ""i dont want to be there"" is an act of victimisation. If a person doesn't want to be there thats their preference. Expressing what you want doesn't mean you are playing a victim. Also, Dragic has been a player most would describe as being respectful and with integrity.  He didn't say that though. He said he ""has higher aspirations"" than playing for Toronto. And Dragic is one of the most low key dirty players in the league. Spit on DeRozan, slapped Ben Simmons, elbowed Jordan Clarkson, tried to injure Khris Middleton...this list goes on."
"Wagner was a very good defender in college, and can become a solid secondary playmaker. Cole is honestly the one I would worry about because he's constantly asking for the ball for no reason from suggs at the top and is more of a chucker/bad decision maker.   Coles's not a better ball handler or playmaker than Suggs or Fultz and the Orlando coaching staff gotta prepare him as a Jordan Clarkson type player, that like Clarkson can learn to play off-ball in the flow of the offense."
Do you think a relatively successful outcome for someone like that would be a bench guard kind of role? With the very best possible outcome being continued development and ending up in a Lou Williams or Jordan Clarkson kind of role?
"&gt;He's worked JJJ, Jalen Johnson, JR Smith, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Clarkson  What about J Jonah Jameson? Or Jonas Jorgenson?"
"I can only think of D. Rose and Jordan Clarkson.. maybe TJ McConnell, Jalen Brunson,  and Patty Mills are arguable. Coincidentally I do like Malachi Flynn too."
"ChrisJohnsonHoops on IG.  He's worked JJJ, Jalen Johnson, JR Smith, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Clarkson and others recently too. Not much to read into."
That would be jordan clarkson first lol
"Not really banter when you got nephews starting to actually believe that people are out to get Schroeder lol.   Man is a 6th man, no more, only less.   Legit if he actually contributed like someone like Jordan Clarkson then I am sure people are actually inclined to give him that 100mill contract"
I could see Josh Christopher becoming a Jordan Clarkson guy. Instant offense off the bench
"Idk it's hard to say for Kidd. He was an elite playmaker and a solid shooter, and in his prime was also an elite defender (was still good defender even then). I'd say Rondo last year on the Lakers but while his numbers similar Rondo didn't help the Lakers as much as Kidd did the Mavericks at all.   For Terry, actually this years Jordan Clarkson is a great comparison numbers wise (Clarkson might be a better defender) but Terry's actual output in the Finals considering the game at the time was closer to like, CJ McCollum.  Third best player besides Dirk and Terry was Shawn Marion. He was a former all star caliber player but had also lost a step. Think like.. idk RoCo last year for the Rockets. Elite defensive stopper. Good for a few buckets and boards. He wasn't a shooter though."
"If he gets the green light, he might be a Jordan Clarkson type eventually."
"Blake was doing stand-up comedy and acting. He was definitely on that tip. He was no Jordan Clarkson or Kyle Kuzma, but he was out there."
2023 WC is gonna be so fun to watch - especially with Philippines in it. Hopefully Jalen Green and Jordan Clarkson suit up for Gilas so we have a chance at an olympic bid haha
"* Jalen Green will be a jordan clarkson at best * Raptors will commit to a full rebuild by the deadline trading Siakam,Dragic,Vanvleet and Boucher * Lakers dont make the finals * Bulls dont make the playoffs * Philly lose in round 1"

Jordan Clarkson is cuter than Kelly Oubre Jr.
Getting downvoted for the truth. Unless he drastically changes his way of playing or becomes consistently efficient it’s gonna be tough for the guy in the league.   He should watch some Jordan Clarkson Jazz tape or something and see how he can still be of use to a team but I don’t see him being much better than that really
"I’ve been a longtime simmons hater since folks were saying he’s better than Tatum.   Now that we’re well past that I’m going the other way. There’s a whole thread right now with idiots going “lol, maaaaybe id trade Keldon Johnson and a bag potato chips lol😂""   Like... Shut up. I feel like this could end up with Ben Simmons as someone's third guy and we're all standing around like.... Waaait what?? Similar with Dennis although I think the issue is that Dennis was always a Maybe overpowered Jordan Clarkson and he's gonna get paid that way."
I get Lakers Jordan Clarkson vibes from him with better defense and worse playmaking
"Royce O’neal, Jordan Clarkson and 2022 second round pick 2024 first round pick."
"Bruh he's black. Also, have you not heard of Rui or Yuto Watanabe? Jalen Green and Jordan Clarkson are also half Pinoy."
Not a given. Jordan Clarkson was all about the Kardashians before he got shipped to Salt Lake City and dude improved a lot there because there ain't shit else to do.
"Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Jordan Clarkson would like to have a word.."
Rookie Jordan Clarkson on the 2014-15 Lakers? (Kobe was injured for the all Star game)
Definitely Jordan Clarkson
"Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams, Colin Sexton"
"On the other hand,  you can't quite only assume the only explanation for that is because those guys were playing with Lebron.   I mean...Lonzo and Ingram certainly stepped it up after they left, but they were both still extremely young at the time. They were expected to continue to get better. You could just as easily argue a year of experience with such a great player was a part of that. And...I dunno...I mean...Kuzma...he may just be not that great of a player.   D'Lo and Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle also all had their best years after their stints with the Lakers, and they never even played with Lebron.   I'll give you that there really has never been a young star emerge while they were on a team with Lebron, but for the most part you aren't ever really expect teams with Lebron (in regards to draft position) to be acquiring fantastic young talent through the draft."
"Lakers do well with their second round picks. THT, Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Jordan Clarkson"
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
jordan clarkson isnt that good cmon
Your team’s 3 point shooting and interior defense will mask a lot of his weaknesses. You guys seemed to need athleticism and size at the wing. He’ll do really well for you guys. Imagine adding 80 pound on Jordan Clarkson and giving him a leg hitch on his 3 pointer. Basically EP.
"Shh, we also gave them Jordan Clarkson a couple years ago too. It’s a new era boys!"
"Absolutely this. A lot of NBA related communities and the nephews therein love their black/white thinking. If a player doesn't do well on a team, it immediately means they're washed out garbage.   Sometimes people just need to find the right team and role in that team. Jordan Clarkson comes to mind."
Definitely not a steal and arguably an overpay he should've been paid similar to Jordan Clarkson.
"Coby white could be a Jordan Clarkson type scorer off the bench, Lauri is allergic to defense and can't score over point guards. He will never ever be a core piece on a contender"
And Coby finally becoming what he was always meant to be (Jordan Clarkson)
"Do you think 18 points, 2.5 assists, and 4 rebounds are starter-quality stats? What about 14.9 points, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 rebounds?  The first is Jordan Clarkson, and the second is Derrick Rose. Both of these guys were sixth men. Clarkson’s stats mirror the one Schroeder had while in OKC when he came off the bench, while Rose’s stats are pretty close to what Schroeder averaged this year.   Schroeder couldn’t get going even when we put the ball in his hands. He’s been a starter for 3/8 years in the nba, including getting to the starting role in Atlanta only to be sent right back to the bench when he got to OKC. He started for us, but he might as well have not been in that lineup with how mediocre he was. Hell, him and Caruso basically did the same thing.   Having seen him play for 60 some games, I can confidently say he’s one of the worst starting point guards in the league, but would be solid as the first option off the bench. That’s a role he thrived in. Even for us, the best he played was when he was up against the backup PG while he was with the second unit."
NAW is not that good imo. Jordan Clarkson on the Lakers vibes is what I get from the dude. Hope I’m wrong
"Definitely. And then such a chill, hilariously low key answer.  Just became a Jordan Clarkson fan."
"lmao I get what you're saying but this is Jordan ""All-NBA Fashion First Team"" Clarkson, he does NOT look like a refugee.... nor does he speak like one."
"""Jordan Clarkson is the 2021 NBA sixth man of the year"""
"I like how a lot of people in here are like “SHE FUCKED UP! HOW COULD SHE NOT RECOGNIZE WHO JORDAN CLARKSON IS?”   Like bro, there are plenty of people in this world who don’t give the same fuck about the nba as you do."
"This is commented a lot but I don't think it's true.  Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
"There are around 200k people in SLC, with 2.6% black population, so there are approximately 5200 black people. Assume half men, so 2600 black men.   33.4% of the city’s population is 25 to 44, now we have 1736 people. I’m going to cut this group in half, as Clarkson is 29 and could pass as any age from 25 to 35, so we are now at 868.   Clarkson being 6’4” puts him in the upper 0.8% of height for the population ages 25-34, knocking this group down to 7 people.   Looking at the Jazz roster from last year, the following players fit the profile of black, 25-35, and 6’4” and above  -	Jarrell Brantley -	Jordan Clarkson -	Derrick Favors -	Rudy Gobert -	Shaq Harrison -	Georges Niang -	Miye Oni  Summary: if you see a very tall black man who looks like he can legally rent a car, there is a 100% chance he plays for the Jazz."

Does she know who Jordan Clarkson is?
lol I was making a joke that Jordan Clarkson is the man behind Air Jordan
"true but klay thompson is also more famous than jordan clarkson, esp for casuals"
Lesser mans Jordan Clarkson is still really handy to have. I CAN get jiggy with that shit
He’s actually much better than Moody and should start while Klay is out averaging 25-30 MPG during that time. That’s why Warriors fans say he’s underrated. He looked pretty good towards the end of the year but his ceiling rn looks like a lesser man’s Jordan Clarkson.
I think that he can become a Jordan Clarkson type of guy which would be extremely solid! I believe in him!
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."

Jordan Clarkson - 20/0/0
"Jordan Clarkson. I remember watching his highlights with my grandpa after we traded for him and being like “damn this dude could be a good spark plug off the bench. A slasher like when we first got Ramon Sessions”. I was right about him being great off the bench, but wrong about the team, him being more of a slasher, and he’s much better than Ramon Sessions lol"
"I knew Jordan Clarkson would be a lightning scorer some day, just didn't think he would be hot and cold. But when he's hot, he's hot."
Someone in an Instagram comment said “Jordan Clarkson hoops like Flight if he was actually good” and I can’t stop thinking about it
Jordan Clarkson
Crazy that Jordan Clarkson isn’t even top 5
When Cleveland traded Jordan Clarkson for Dante exum people on Twitter were mocking that trade saying they both were essentially the same player. Not so much now.
"from bbref:   December 23, 2019: Traded by the Utah Jazz with a 2022 2nd round draft pick and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Jordan Clarkson. (2022 second-round pick is owned by SAS) (2023 second-round pick is owned by GSW)  January 13, 2021: As part of a 4-team trade, traded by the Cleveland Cavaliers with a 2022 1st round draft pick to the Houston Rockets; the Brooklyn Nets traded Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Brooklyn Nets traded Rodions Kurucs, a 2021 1st round draft pick (Cade Cunningham was later selected), a 2022 1st round draft pick, a 2023 1st round draft pick, a 2024 1st round draft pick, a 2025 1st round draft pick, a 2026 1st round draft pick and a 2027 1st round draft pick to the Houston Rockets; the Brooklyn Nets traded Caris Levert to the Indiana Pacers; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Brooklyn Nets; the Houston Rockets traded James Harden to the Brooklyn Nets; the Houston Rockets traded a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Indiana Pacers; and the Indiana Pacers traded Victor Oladipo to the Houston Rockets. 2024 2nd-rd pick is CLE own Houston has the option to swap 1st round draft picks with Brooklyn in 2021.

Was traded to the Cavs in exchange for Jordan Clarkson
casual take and you're 100% wrong lmao. you think the jazz has been a top defensive team lately because of bojan bogdanovic/jordan clarkson/georges niang/arguable their second best defender royce  o'neale(who struggles against quicker smaller guards)?  tell me you don't watch basketball without telling me you don't watch basketball
You’re neglecting the part where his talent level was that of a solid sixth man type.   Like Jordan Clarkson would put up filthy numbers if nobody had tape on him.
Alonzo Trier. Could have been a Jordan Clarkson like 6man but his attitude got him out of the league entirely.
"Its NYC Fashion Week this week.  Do NBA players go to fashion shows and model clothes  like Russ? I saw Jordan Clarkson with his fit,  but i doubt he struts the runway. Are they there just to show off?"
"As someone who watched him play for many years, this is the answer.  People will always bring up the fact that he’s shown capability to score 25 PPG but there is no way he would ever average 20 PPG on a decent, contending team.  Ellis is like what you’d want in a 6th man, not a starter. Kind of like a Jordan Clarkson-in-Utah type role."
He's a volume scorer. He's more like a Jordan Clarkson than a Joe Harris. Taking a lot of tough shots. He definitely had a bad 21 playoffs but people are acting like he had this huge sophomore slump that he didn't have. He was also banged up a lot and every time he got back in rhythm he seemed to get hurt.
"Do you mean he can’t shoot them or just doesn’t? Because I think some teams specifically don’t take them (this is also one reason that Jordan Clarkson is better on the Jazz, they basically told him to avoid those )"
Jordan Clarkson is gonna be the next JR/Lou Williams dont @ me
Jordan Clarkson really took them Kobe words to heart.   But hey.. he realized he can do it and do it well.
"Jordan Clarkson reminds me of Jay Cutler as a Bears fan. Chuck it fuck it. It it works great if not, it’s for the memes. Shooters shoot yeeters yeet"
 Better Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan Clarkson
Reigning sixth man of the year Jordan Clarkson.
Was that Jordan Clarkson that heaved the game ball?
Jordan Clarkson as the center piece of a Ben Simmons trade and Utah fans are saying no. Wow-wee
"Charles Barkley would easily be considered as being better than Malone, if he'd shot 35% on the obscene amount of 3's he attempted  Ben Simmons - Shooting  Trae Young - Defense (Trae's doing well for himself, but the dude would be the frontrunner for both MVP and MIP, if he magically became an average defender)  Young Rondo - Shooting (he'd be seen in the same light as CP3)  Roy Hibbert - Shooting  Carmelo Anthony - Defense  Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams and all the other microwave guards throughout NBA history - Defense  Blake Griffin, Amar'e and all the other athletic forwards that never became true superstars - Defense and/or Shooting"
"Lmfao Pelicans contending? Hornets? Why would they trade for Dragic?   Lakers with who? They trading 12 of their minimum contracts for one Dragic?   Hawks with who? They trading their promising rookies for old Dragic? 😂  Celtics with who? They trading Marcus Smart for Dragic? Horford for Dragic?   Jazz with who? Conley for Dragic? Ingles for Dragic? Boggy for Dragic? Jordan Clarkson for Dragic? lmfao  Clippers with who? Marcus Morris? Maybe they’ll trade Kawhi for Dragic 😂 or maybe Raptors take Bledsoe for Dragic right? 😂 or Luke Kennard lmao  Look at those teams and they don’t have any guys that would match up to trade for Dragic without giving up contributing players / promising rookies  Again, you sound stupid."
"Brandon Ingram got a max, D'Angelo Russell got a max, randle got a bag, Nance is a great player, Josh Hart is a great bench player, Kuz just got us Russell Westbrook lol  We drafted great players, even our second rounders like Jordan Clarkson hit , Thomas Bryant is starting for the wiz, this idea of disappointing players is garbage   &gt;I highly doubt magic was the dominant factor there, but ya never know I guess.   Literally gave an article with lebron saying why he went to la, and it had nothing to do with the movies or the night life, he could have stayed in Miami if he just wanted the nightlife   &gt;And no, nowhere was I talking about Pelinka specifically there.  That's why it's a garbage statement, lebron and AD were not products of the previous FO, so it's just you saying general statements that have no context   The Lakers were bad for a period of time , what does that have to do with the reason lebron is here now? We had the assets and the cap space and lebron saw that as well"
"Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum, Jordan Clarkson, and Aaron Gordon"
Jordan Clarkson
"Jordan clarkson. Sheerly because of his size, but he put in a ton of effort so you gotta love him"
MVP: Joel Embiid   DPOY: Thybulle/Giannis   ROTY: Jalen Suggs   MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr.   6MOY: Jordan Clarkson
"MVP: Steph Curry  MIP: Jordan Poole  6MOTY: Jordan Poole  ROY: Moses Moody  COTY: Steve Kerr  EOTY: Bob Myers  &amp;#x200B;  J.k, 6MOTY probably goes to Clarkson and I reckon 6MOTY to Cade."
MVP: Paul George MIP: Tyrese Haliburton 6MOY: Jordan Clarkson ROY: Cade Cunningham  DPOY: Jrue Holiday
"Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson and 2 first rounders and a few 2nd rounders"
"They didn't have the personnel to go small.  The move that few people seem to mention is leaving an injured Conley in the game and taking Jordan Clarkson out.  The Jazz didn't need to stop the Clippers, they had a big enough lead that they would have won if they just kept scoring.  Conley's injury didn't allow him to be effective on defense or offense.  The missed adjustment was not giving Clarkson more minutes down the stretch."
"Lots.  Derrick Rose. He was setting up to be a huge rival for my Cavs but after the injury and his short time playing for us I can’t help but root for him.  Jordan Clarkson. I was just an overall angry person in 2018-19. Watching the Cavs wasnt any fun, and when JORDAN CLARKSON and RODNEY HOOD are your 1 &amp; 2 options, it’s gonna make you a pessimist. I gave him a lot of shit but I’m glad he became an important player on a contender. He deserves it"
"Exactly.  To be a star, you have to be more than one dimensional.  Even with scoring.  A one dimensional scorer looks like Jordan Clarkson.  6th man, come in, get bucks, draw fouls, sit back down.  (I like Jordan Clarkson, take it easy on me Jazz fans)."
Jordan Clarkson
you’re telling me a lazy jordan clarkson and nobody’s aren’t playing high level nba defense?? say it ain’t so…
Why Jordan Clarkson look like a mypark player.
One of his mid range shots had Jordan Clarkson “defending” him.
"Jalen Johnson, BJ Boston, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Trey Lyles, JJJ, etc. There were a bunch of NBA guys there."
Why is Jordan Clarkson playing in PJs?
Jordan Clarkson right there bro
Jordan Clarkson
"I'd say Cleveland as well. We've traded the following players one way or another:      Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, George Hill, Dante Exum, Kyle Korver, Alec Burks and best of all Jordan Clarkson."
"Yup. Definitely. The Lakers love guys like THT throughout the years.   ""Young with potential"" who were late picks.  We've had a few who didn't turn out well like Darius Morris, Devin Ebanks, Andrew Goudlock, Anthony Brown etc.   But we've had some success too with Jordan Clarkson, Thomas Bryant, Ivica Zubac, Alex Caruso, David Nwaba.   THT has been good enough. It's just that Lakers fans are just more vocal and lakers players get more spotlight.   JC and AC were better prospects IMO but they don't have THT's physical gifts which the Lakers are banking on."
"Lakers were offering 19 year old Andrew Bynum who was looking like a future star, prime Odom, along with other assets. If the reports are to be believed the wolves and lakers had a handshake deal in place but the wolves ended up taking al Jefferson instead and then rest is history.   Obviously Bynum and Odom ended up being key pieces for the lakers and the wolves ended up with nothing and sucked since then.   My personal biased opinion is 19 year old Bynum+the soon to be 6th man of the year Odom is far better than worthless late picks and al Jefferson. Jefferson was looking to be good at the time but it would be like a team turning down wiseman/picks/Jordan clarkson for nurkic+picks."
"His approach was great too. Played in the flow of the offense until he got into a rhythm. I never felt like he was forcing the issue like, say, a Jordan Clarkson type bench scorer."
You can’t take credit for Jordan Clarkson winning 6MOTY lol. That’s asinine.
Is that Jordan Clarkson to the left of him?
"i was sure you were about to come out with the stats. he is going into his 4th year, he tore his meniscus and spent time in the gleague. last season was the first one he got minutes and immediately arranged with a huge role and alongisde player that didn't fit him. he was the last guy to get the ball while his offense is his best weapon. he wasn't used properly. he is an extremely good shooter and he is cobstantly improve. i didn't set the ceiling as jams harden. i said jordan clarkson. i think he has the potential to be more, but even if not, he would still be a valuable piece off the bench. calling a bust someonr thst can already contribute on his rookie deal, picked at 18th, with all the tools to succeed, nice work ethic is not right. do ypu not believe this, go ahead lmao"
"?! Hell no?! He was a solid starter this season, stilk young, ton of potential and all the tools to have a successful career. Worst case scenario now it's a player like Jordan Clarkson which is solid at 18. Before him guys like Jerome Robinson  and Zhaire Smith got picked so he definitely fell. After him there aren't many better player, maybe around his level. Definitely not a bust lmao"
"Yes but all his role players are specifically shooters and offensive players, the jazz themselves have talked about how since gobert is extra good at defense they go extra hard on finding 3+D players who excel at 3 and lack a bit at d. He's literally on the team with the 3rd highest ORtg in the entire league, it's not just him. Jordan Clarkson, bojan, Conely, gobert and Ingles all averaged 12+ppg last season."
"Correction, ""championship basketball""  You sound like a 2014 Lakers fan trying to explain to this sub that how Jordan Clarkson has franchise potential"
Last year in Mitchell’s 4th season he averaged 26.7 ppg on 57% TS and Devin Booker averaged 25.6 ppg on 59% TS in his 6th season. This is with Devin Booker having Chris Paul on his team and Donovan Mitchell’s 2nd best scoring threat probably being Jordan Clarkson. I’m not like saying TS is the end all be all of efficiency or anything because my main argument is what Mitchell has accomplished as the sole number 1 option compared to what Booker has done before CP3
It's hard to hit shots when people guard you  Kevin Durant: 28%  James Harden: 23%  Jordan Clarkson: 50%

I saw Jordan Clarkson in LA last year as I was walking to lunch. I nodded at him. He nodded at me.  It was great
"That comment = Jordan Clarkson tank chief commander. Painful to the eyes, meme-worthy.  But imho Kwame/Mihm/Smush days were more painful deep inside, due to the fact that Kobe basically lost his duration of his absolute prime for that."
When Jordan Hill and Jordan Clarkson we’re our only hope
s/o to Jordan Clarkson. Damn.
Jordan Clarkson has been in the nba longer than Kuz and has 1 more 30+ point games than kuz has and he has had the green light since Bron left Cleveland
Jordan Clarkson in shambles.
"And Corey Joseph, Jordan Clarkson, ThT, etc."
"Agreed, ideally he would be somewhere around a Jordan Clarkson for the Bulls"
Player comp Jordan Clarkson?
"Per IG, Simmons, Rondo, Jordan Clarkson, Justise Winslow, JJJ, Jarred Vanderbilt, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Brandon Clarke, BJ Boston were at the most recent run, and Michael Beasley, Lonnie Walker, Ja, Maxey, and Bazely have gone to other ones."
"Let’s keep going down the line Jordan Clarkson, Trey Lyles, Eric Bledsoe, Darius Garland, Talen Horton Tucker, Dion Waiters…a homeless person could have done those right?"
"The theory doesn't make sense tho Noel doesn't have enough of a profile to change the market. I'm not coming at u just the theory. It's likely to try to get a bigger contract the next season, he tries to get guys to have a good FA season on a 1 yr so some team overpays for them on a multi-year contract if he fells they can make more. It doesn't always work out but when it does u have guys like Jordan Clarkson who just resigned in Utah but could've gotten way more if he left. He bet on himself &amp; won with a raise &amp; the perfect situation for him"
"Nah, they're playing vs other pros. Jalen Johnson, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Rondo, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles, JJJ, Jordan Bell, and Brandon Clarke were at the last run with BJ and Simmons."
"I'm still surprised that Jordan Clarkson re-signed with the Jazz last off season. When I found out his agent was Rich Paul, I was almost certain he would be going back to LA, especially with with how good his season ended. At the very least, I expected the signing to be a little drawn out, but IIRC his signing was one of the first ones that was announced that off season."
Jordan Clarkson is not better than Andrew Wiggins
"Rob Edwards, Frank Jackson, Jordan Clarkson"
"&gt;  but out of his class, there are 3-5 players better than him  Embiid, Smart, Randle, Lavine, Capela, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Jordan Clarkson, Jusuf Nurkic (when healthy), TJ Warren (when healthy) are all guys who I think are better than Wiggins is right now. Dude probably isn't top 10 from his own class."
You're forgetting Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan Clarkson is the cutest player in the league
"Lakers have the young guns baby, we talking lonzo, kuzma, Ingram, josh hart, dangelo, Jordan Clarkson, mf Alex Caruso, randle, who else am I missing?"
"Which is a system that works if you have say, Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley with rotating in Jordan Clarkson and Joe Ingles in the mix, but not with Bledsoe and Lonzo"
You got any clips on any of them using it? Haven't seen anyone of those do it except Embiid. And Jordan Clarkson did it [one time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4OpC3vPZag).
"All Drew Hanlen players use it - Beal, Tatum, Lavine, Jordan Clarkson, Oubre, Embiid etc"
"????   AD, Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Draymond Green, THT, KCP, Gary Trent Jr, Tyrese Maxes, Darius Garland, and many more  They have other clients and most have been paid."
"the only 2 players that I think can actually dress are ibaka &amp; jordan clarkson, everybody else you can tell their stylist picked it out &amp; the clothes look like they’re wearing them if that makes sense"
I think Jordan Clarkson and Russ actually have unique and interesting outfits from time to time. Most of the times it’s just a designer hodgepodge though which is tacky IMO.
The cavs traded away Jordan Clarkson for Donte exum…. Then Clarkson became the 6th man of the year.
Jazz were able to trade a broken piece of Australian Eucalyptus for Jordan Clarkson. That was a pretty notable fleecing of the Cavs.
"&gt; He can set up his own shot and is decent from 3 but cant create for others.  I mean, you're basically describing Jordan Clarkson who just won 6MOTY.   And Jamal Crawford, who won it multiple times. And LouWill, with the one exception of he could setup Trez, but no one else ever.   If CHI wanted a non-scoring floor general, they could've just signed Jordan McLaughlin or something."
Dante Exum for Jordan Clarkson
"As a Jazz fan, there are a few that come to mind that could end up looking this bad for other teams.  Dante Exum and 2nd round picks for Jordan Clarkson seems like the Jazz made off with it considering what has come of Clarkson and Exum  The other two are the Nuggets getting a pick and Trey Lyles back for Donovan Mitchell's draft rights and the Nugs sending Rudy Gobert's draft rights for a second and cash."
I know he was marketed as a point guard during his draft but it really seems like he's more of a Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson type player.
"Anybody in the league that is annoying af like this for genuine reasons related to basketball is always someone you hate on other teams, but would absolutely love them on yours. For me it’s guys like Norman Powell, Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, Derrick White, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, etc… fuck all those dudes, until they join my squad, then they’re my dudes lol. I realize Jamal Murray is a guy like this for people outside of Denver lol."
"I hope that cash bought Denver a nice toaster for their break room or something. None of the other 3 players ever did anything for them. Building off that list, I  would also tack on Jordan Clarkson for Dante Exum and two second round picks.   Gobert via trade, Mitchell via trade, Clarkson via trade, Ingles via waivers and O'Neale was undrafted. 5 of the top 8 Jazz players were scooped up for free basically. Not the point of the thread but it is interesting to think about"
"this makes me feel old, jordan clarkson has 8000 points?? doesn't feel like it was too long ago he was a rookie"
I ❤️ JORDAN CLARKSON
"I mean, I don't think you missed from a talent perspective. The guy could've easily had a Jordan Clarkson-type career."
"The odd thing about these Jordan Clarkson comparisons is they’re very different players or at least supposed to be. The way Russell played in Brooklyn is nothing like Clarkson except they both get volume. He shouldn’t be your top offensives player, but scoring wasn’t even his best talent. He was an every down pick and roll passer who wasn’t very efficient but could make all the passes."
"Yeah, but we’ve had 7 seasons to understand and accept his limitations as a player. He’s a shooting guard in an undersized point guard’s body. If he was a little less talented, or developed a little bit later, or wasn’t the number 2 pick, people would love him as a Jordan Clarkson type with 6MOY potential - which is still pretty freaking good.  But coaches and fans have to accept that he’s not the type of player who’s going to spread the ball around, and he’s frankly not talented enough to be the main focal point of an offense. He’s gonna get buckets and that’s it."
Haven't watched any Minnesota yet so I don't know shit but I do wonder why they haven't gotten Malik Beasley involved? After averaging 20 last season I was thinking he'd be a pretty legit scorer in a Jordan Clarkson style 6 man role. But he's only taking 7 shots a game so far.
"""It's Jordan Clarkson time.""    \- Jordan Clarkson"
More like a better Jordan Clarkson with the same shot selection and tunnel vision
2nd longest active streak? Jordan Clarkson.
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."
Hes a 6th man scorer.  Like a bigger Jordan Clarkson.  A combo guard.
"Jordan Clarkson is pretty smooth, I think he should be higher in this conversation."
"https://theathletic.com/2908093/2021/10/23/davion-mitchell-and-the-kings-prep-for-the-steph-curry-test-and-a-warriors-team-that-discussed-drafting-him  someone else can post this for the karma.  it's an article by anthony slater and sam amick; the former is normally the warriors beatwriter but apparently the athletic got rid of their kings writer and maybe he's filling in a bit in the interim?  r/kings seemed to not like their old beatwriter anyway. orz  anyway, it's a nice piece about davion with specific video examples of various matchups.  also talks a bit about warriors pre-draft processes this year and how they regarded davion and some other prospects with complimentary quotes from kerr.  also mentions that davion got specific tips from luke walton for dealing with jordan clarkson and steph since he coached them before."
"Yeah he was being hyped up so much by Blazers front office after that one Kings game. Neil Olshey was publicly saying Simons was the best prospect he's EVER seen, even though he was hired right before the team drafted some guy named Lillard!  They tried to run him as the primary PG for the 2nd unit in his second season and he was simply not ready, and eventually got benched in favor of Gary Trent.  His third year he did improve as an elite 3 point shooter on good volume,  but could not drive the ball at all.   This year he is driving with confidence, along with some added muscle and height over the summer. Even Lillard was joking that Simons ""grew up"" this past off season. Dude looking like Jordan Clarkson with extra hops out there."
"Kevin Porter Jr., Dwayne Wade, Jordan Clarkson and Kyle Lowry"
"The 2018 Cavs had ancient DWade, pre-career revival DRose, Isaiah Thomas after his play fell off a cliff, Iman Shumpert, and Jae Crowder and turned that into Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, and George Hill."
J..C.... J Caruso... Jose Caruso? Noo... Jose Calderon? \**reads Larry Nance Jr*\* Oh! Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan Clarkson
"Kuzma about to pull a Jordan Clarkson, revive his career after leaving the lakers"
"lmaao I respect the confidence but trae and luka are bonafide superstars. Herro isn't even the best player on his own team; hell, he doesn't even start lol.   If he wants to compare himself to anyone it's Jordan Clarkson, and even then Clarkson almost seems like a tier above, I mean he's coming off a 6MOY season."
"yeah you right, honestly let's get lebron out of the list too. 2003 was ages ago, old ass dude. MJ too when I think about it, just milkmen back then. Bring in Jordan Clarkson"
Cam playing better but I still think he’s gotta chill. You can tell he has no intention to playmake when he catches it.  He’s on his Jordan Clarkson/Henny God type shit.
Same with Jordan Clarkson. Now I’m a straight up Stan
Larry Nance &amp; Jordan Clarkson would like to have a word with you.
"Below are some of the players who are gone now, but were on the Laker’s roster the year before LeBron joined them, and during his first season with the team -    Lonzo Ball    De’Andre Hunter  **Was drafted by Lakers but shipped off in the AD trade.    Ivica Zubac    Thomas Bryant    Brandon Ingram    Kyle Kuzma    Josh Hart    Alex Caruso    KCP    Larry Nance    Julius Randle    Reggie Bullock    Jordan Clarkson    Brook Lopez    LeBron James   I wouldn't mind seeing this team in action."
"I agree with this. Dude looked great because his shots were falling. If he has an off night, it just looks like he hogs the ball and takes inefficient shots and plays like he’s the star of the team. Leading the second unit ala Jordan Clarkson would be a good move."
I noticed that too.  Definitely new emphasis.  Even Jordan Clarkson was fighting hard at it.
Sexton should be coming off the bench with Rubio.  Then all he has to do is focus on getting buckets.  The Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson role would fit him well.
I think he’s just referencing how everyone called our young players trash when they were on the Lakers but then suddenly love them once they’re not on the Lakers. Examples:  -	Julius Randle -	Jordan Clarkson -	D’Angelo Russel -	Larry Nance -	Brandon Ingram -	Lonzo Ball -	Alex Caruso -	Kyle Kuzma
"Don’t forget Deangelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson"
Poole reminds me of Jordan Clarkson.

"I think people say it about a lot of guys and it's usually pretty accurate. Frankly I think it is true of Caruso- he's a very solid role player but people treat him like a household name on this sub lmao. Jordan Clarkson was incredibly overrated, too. I think the most ridiculous one was kuzma though. The trades he was being featured in for a minute there were absolutely delusional."
"Dude I just replied to that 7 year old thread before seen the dates, lol. Here I was wondering why they used 2012 as a cutoff year.   2014 obviously has to be included because of Jokic:   Jokic, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jordan Clarkson."
"2014 2nd Round had Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"&gt;Yeah the three time dpoy and 5 time first all defense is really close to a one time second team all defense.  So I guess you were too busy having your little REEEEE episode because I never even implied that they were close either. First you act like how you did and now you're trying to say I said something I didn't? Boy you must be one miserable person to talk to.  &gt;I had a reasonable response to a stupid take.  No you didn't. There was no need for you to be triggered about it and for you to think that's a reasonable just cements how much of a embarrassing childish person you are. No one teach you any better? You're free to be how you are, but don't make the idiotic mistake of thinking you're being  ""reasonable"". Lol, now THAT'S a stupid take.  &gt;Let's say someone asked for a team based solely around offence and I put Jordan clarkson in there despite the fact that there are obviously far better choices to be made, since he is not one of the top 4 offensive guards, do you really think that is reasonable? I mean he can score, but he's clearly not good enough to be in a ""best offensive players"" team. That's the equivalent of what you've done.  Lopez has been one of the better starting defense players in the league. I'm aware he's not as good as Gobert, but I already laid out the 2 reasons I put Brook there. You going to fuck off or are you just going to double down more?"

"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
Jalen Suggs the supposed nba ready pg that doesn’t have the handles to play pg whatsoever  Wagner played terrible in preseason not a good sign especially when you compare him to duarte another pro ready role player prospect picked lower  Davion Mitchell seems like the new pat bev  Bouknight will be a worse version of Jordan clarkson at best until he improves his passing  those are the only players I watched
It was over for him once he tried to jump with Jordan Clarkson
i mean even someone like jordan clarkson or joe ingles is better than kyrie literally not playing   not saying they should do this but it’s something to consider
Jordan Clarkson is just different right now bro idk but he is for sure up there.
"As a Lakers Fan I disagree. They weren't going to build around him. They were in rebuild mode with tons of high draft lotteries. There were tons of young talents but no direction and terrible coaching. They had Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Julius, Kuzma etc. Nobody was able to pick up the torch and stand out consistently.    They were switching up the chemistry by switching him as a starter or coming off the bench over multiple seasons. Nobody is going to develop correctly like that. I'm glad he was able to go to another team. He was able to mature his game properly."
"I kind of seeing him going down two potential routes. I think he could potential follow a Brandon Jennings type of path (hopefully minus injuries), potentially a lesser Donovan Mitchell type player. Or I think he goes down the Jordan Clarkson path and he could be one of the best 6th men in the league for a scoring and hustle punch off the bench."
"2011 playoffs, I substitute Luka for Nowitzki:  Kyle Lowry (Kidd)  Derrick Jones Jr. (DeShawn Stevenson)  Luka  Luguentz Dort (Shawn Marion)  Brook Lopez (Tyson Chandler)  Bench:  Jordan Clarkson (Jason Terry)  Brunson (Barea)  Carmelo Anthony (Peja)  Willie Cauley-Stein (Brendan Haywood)  Minimum contract veterans for the spots of Cardinal, Mahinmi and Brewer."

"""Its Jordan Clarkson time""-Jordan Clarkson"
Looks like the Jordan Clarkson show
I'm going with Jordan Clarkson here. Low BBBIQ. The extra B is for BYOBB
20 avg is not that hard to achieve in today's league tho. Dint Jordan Clarkson avg 18 or something
"Telling it like it is man. To make a comparison, they're crucifying you for drafting Jordan Clarkson instead of Michael Jordan when the guys before you drafted Bradley Beal instead of Michael Jordan and that's totally okay for some reason."
"Crazy that the top 2 are Laker greats, Jordan Clarkson is something else man!"
I got on board when I saw how on board he got with Washington. I feel like he could be a really good 6th man. Kind of like a Jordan Clarkson type guy.
MVP - Luka Doncic   DPOY - Rudy Gobert   MIP - Michael Porter Jr   6MOY - Jordan Clarkson  ROY - Cade Cunningham
"I mean there’s Jordan Clarkson. Then again that’s only one guy. He’s the outlier, not the average. However, there is one kid tearing it up over there. Can’t remember his name though"
"Man, watching that shit was tough. I was watching the 2014 Draft and was absolutely ecstatic the Lakers drafted him. Opening Night 2014 just hurt seeing him go down the first game. Fortunately, Jordan Clarkson was a bright spot that season and he was a their second round pick. I'm still mad the Lakers let Randle walk in 2018 but I'm so happy he's flourishing in New York"
Jordan Clarkson
"They tanked and got Alex Caruso? Kyle Kuzma? Talen Horton Tucker? Jordan Clarkson?  Just trying to figure out how those 4 players in particular fit into your bs narrative.   It’s also funny how one comment says you can’t count top picks, if they bust or not, because it’s consensus, and you say you can’t count them because they “tanked”.   Your insecurity is showing."
"They found Lebron AD and a championship.   Management also has the responsibility to make their franchise appealing to free agents.   They also drafted Jordan Clarkson, Kuzma, Ingram, Ball, D’Angelo, and THT, and signed Caruso from the G league. For a team that historically doesn’t rely on the draft to win, that’s a decent amount of talent recognized and drafted."
I think he can genuinely be a Jordan Clarkson type player at his peak
Jordan Clarkson willing to call little boys “Papi” confirmed.
[Jordan Clarkson doesn't sound like a big gay guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RXaERVhNuU)
Harden  Jordan Clarkson  Stanley Johnson  Carmelo   Kyrie
"Jordan Clarkson should’ve said “I’m not calling him papi, that’s Gay”  And when everyone hunts him down for homophobia, he can be like “what? That’s Gay!”"
"poole's best case scenario is jordan clarkson, tht can become much better than that"
"I used to play basketball with Andre Roberson at Randolph AFB growing up. He has like 10 sisters they all like 6""2. He was athletic could run dunk play defense and was just uber long I was shocked he made it to the NBA if I'm being honest.  Side note: I used to play basketball with Jordan Clarkson in middle school used to go to his house on Fridays and play pick up. He was always good, I was always jealous and tried to guard him he cooked me every time lmao"
"jordan clarkson for utah. yes his job is to just be instant points, but man there were so many moments where he missed open three point shooters and instead tried to finish over three guys at the rim"
Michael Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson has a case though
Thats ok you have Jordan Clarkson
I think you replied to the wrong Comment but I absolutely agree I really wish I could find the full Jordan Clarkson interview because the way he deadpan says he went to “a lot” of jazz games was hilarious
Jordan Clarkson saying he goes to Jazz games vibes
"He will probably become a Jordan Clarkson type player. Now don’t take that as a bash on either of them, that level of play is pretty damn good. And I have one fact that really proves my point:   Both are named Jordan. I rest my case."
"I think it's very realistic to expect Jordan Clarkson type production out of him. In terms of his true ceiling, I think it's possible he ends up as a ""lower tier"" all-star, like a Kemba Walker level player. Either way I full-heartedly believe he has a promising career ahead of him. He's clearly got talent, and everyone in the organization says he works his ass off, and his improvement since being drafted would seem to back that up."
"Yeah, I view his ceiling is a Caris Levert type (maybe more consistent/less injury prone).   However I don’t really view him as a high level starter to be honest. I think a realistic projection for him would be more the Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, Jordan Clarkson type role as a spark plug bench scorer.   He could probably be a starter on some teams (bad/lotto teams), but ideally on a good team his role would be a 6th man type role as a bench spark plug.   Who knows though, the guy was a high ceiling prospect who has improved every year so far. So it wouldn’t be too surprising to me for him to beat my expectations. Easily the best draft pick the Warriors made since they won a ring."
"For a team desperately lacking scoring and shooting outside of Steph (until Klay comes back), Poole provides that.   He can create and shoot off the dribble, the only player on the team besides Steph who can put pressure at the rim (though he needs to get stronger to be a consistent finisher through contact).   He’s basically a 6MOY, Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson type player right now who can get you 30pts when he’s hitting his 3’s like he was yesterday.  But he needs to bulk up and significantly improve his defense if he’s going to be anything more than a microwave bench scorer.   We over hype him because everyone says he’s the hardest worker on the team and you can see it with how much he’s improved IN SEASON. He was a 19yr old late 1st round pick who’s made huge improvements in his 1st two years.   He also is learning and mimicking Steph. His ability to shoot off the dribble, specifically his step back 3 plus his off ball movement.   Between Poole, Moody, Kuminga and Wiseman - there’s a lot to be excited about and we just need one or two of these guys to pop if we want to prolong the core’s window."
"Elite sixth man, maybe strong starter if he can become an adequate defender (he’s big enough in theory, but he’s pretty bad right now). Jordan Clarkson is a solid comp"
"I think over last season he's shown to be a pretty reliable option as a secondary ball handler when playing with the main unit and a jolt of scoring for the bench. I think it's reasonable to (offensively) expect a Eric Gordon type, a Jordan Clarkson with a bit more point guard ability.  Now, if he's actually bombing stuff like in this first preseason game..."
"I think Jordan Clarkson is a realistic expectation, a sixth man that would make anyone's (playoff) rotation and will often play crunch time while avaraging 16/4/4"
"Absolute worst case this year GTJ is our Jordan Clarkson, first man off the bench and just fucking gunning."
"6th man scoring off the bench in the mold of Jordan Clarkson, Lou will, Jamal Crawford"
Ceiling is All-star. I’m still saying realistically he’s a lesser Jordan Clarkson.
"Klay won't start when he comes back, especially if Poole's thriving. And 6MOY is one of those rewards that favors early season/streaky play. Jordan Clarkson jumps to mind."
by first name he's basically only got Clarkson still to beat (sorry Jordan Farmar fans)
"1) Eligible but not in the league- Isaiah Thomas  2) Short contracts(two-ways, ten-day contracts)- Karim Mané  3) Non-rotation bench players- Justin Robinson  4) Rotational bench player- Brad Wanamaker   5) Elite bench player(6 MOTY candidates)- Jordan Clarkson  6) Basic starter- Harrison Barnes   7) Niche Starter- Myles Turner   8) Elite starter- Jerami Grant   9) Border line All-Star- CJ McCollum   10) All-Star- Donovan Mitchell   11) All-NBA- Luka Doncic   11) MVP Level- Kevin Durant"
"But it's still not enough offense, you have to ship out sabonis for a good offensive player. Maybe something like:       marcus smart to the jazz      sabonis to the celtics      jordan clarkson and aaron nesmith to the pacers.  I don't think this makes enough sense but maybe it could be tweaked"
I wonder what Poole’s ceiling is. Even being a Jordan Clarkson type would be really good but he’s already doing this so young
Poole - he turns into our Jordan Clarkson as 6th man spark plug.
&gt;Dinwiddie Bogdan Jordan Clarkson  That's a massive stretch
Its honestly close  Jokic  Embiid  Clint Capela  Julius Randle  Jerami Grant  Marcus Smart  Jusef Nurkic  Zach Lavine  Could possibly make an argument for:  Dinwiddie  Bogdan  Jordan Clarkson
I can't even begin to see the arguments for AG (I mean lol) or Jerami but being 7ish still kind of proves your point. I respect it  &gt;Could make an argument for: &gt;Dinwiddie  &gt;Bogdan  &gt;Jordan Clarkson  &gt;TJ Warren  LMAO
"He’s been good with the Clippers, but he was sooo bad with Cavs. Remember when Derrick Rose and Jordan Clarkson were garbage under him and then immediately turned it around after leaving."
Those are Jordan Clarkson numbers!  (Seriously tho Clarkson looks like he had a good game today but I checked a few days ago and he was averaging 27% on NINE 3PA lol)
Jordan Clarkson is making a strong 6OTY case
"&gt; And Lebron mainly plays with old guy  Ingram, Lonzo, Caruso, Jordan Clarkson, Kuzma, Kyrie, Joe Harris  All guys who have a good to decent chance to play in the finals in their careers. Lonzo and Caruso are on a good team, Clarkson is a on a good team, Joe Harris and Kyrie are on good teams. Ingram is playing with Zion. Kuz is on the 3 seed."
"George Hill in Milwaukee, Jordan Clarkson in Utah."
"I’ve watched enough of Jordan clarkson and Donovan Mitchell chucking shots and failing to make easy passes to know what I’m looking at is not optimal. We’re not saying Mitchell isn’t extremely talented and shouldn’t be shooting/jazz would be better without him. We’re just saying he needs to take a step back sometimes and figure out when he should draw extra defenders and kick and when he should take over the offense. It’s a fine line. PG does a great job of this I feel like, one of his most underrated qualities since he’s not known as much of a playmaker."
"KCP and Harrell do not qualify here because they’re not drafted nor even started their career with Lakers. Harrell was on the Rockets and found himself to be the player he is with the Clippers. KCP was an already established role player with the Pistons before his Lakers run.  Josh Hart and Alex Caruso are better selections   It’s worth noting the other young guys on that list  have not made any impactful Playoffs appearances or any appearance at all.   DLo was a bum in his first and only Playoff debut with the Nets, Kuzma was absolute dogshit against the Suns last year, Randle was legit awful in the Hawks series. Zubac didn’t look too good against the Mavs.. Larry Nance and Jordan Clarkson were not ready and just not that good on that 2018 Cavs run with LeBron leading the way"
"I just think it makes more sense to be mad at the sports media, or the Lakers themselves for spending so much money, leveraging their position in LA to attract players. As far as I can tell, Laker fans are pretty well behaved on this board.   Lakers fans are actually pretty laid back compared to other fan bases. And Caruso actually being good should give us some vindication that we’re not just making stuff up.   In the last decade, we signed Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng to massive deals, were horrible for a long time, then traded away our entire future for one bubble ring. And now we’ll need to rebuild. We’re stuck with Westbrook next year too, and he’s owed 50 million. Our roster could be Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, and Zubac, with Alex Caruso coming off the bench. Instead we have the retirement home.  It’s been a tough run for the Lakers too."
"that’s just one tiny solution, Ingles and Jordan Clarkson are defensive liability yet Snyder put them together on the floor a lot"
And Jordan Clarkson playing bad in 3/3 of the games.
I care if a guy doesn't finish. I don't want to see Jordan Clarkson miss layups after a ridiculous spin move.
You said he’s worth 10mg easily. You realize that’s Jordan Clarkson money. He played well last year but not enough for that kind of money.

JR's legacy lives on through Jordan Clarkson. Thus the transfer of body tats.
"My problem with the 6MOTY award is in recent history it almost always goes to a very specific type of player. Specifically a shooting guard bucket getter.   9 out of the last 10 have went to a SG. It’s almost always the Jamal Crawford/Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson types. Not saying they weren’t deserving but what about the defensive guys, rebounders, and facilitators?"
"Just pathetic. And to think the Lakers once had Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart - all of whom are decent to good players. All traded away."
"No it doesn't, but based on how this sub called literally every lakers draft pick that turned into at worst a decent NBA player (D'Lo, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo, BI, Kuzma, those guys) a bust I've developed a ""wait and see"" approach to developing players."
Pre-Utah Clarkson is his ceiling. To be honest I don't think anybody thought jordan clarksons ceiling would be what he is now.
"Was wondering the same thing. Maybe not hard to find for a player like Lebron, but for Jordan Clarkson this has to be a very niche product"
Brain dead take to say Green’s ceiling is Jordan Clarkson
"The Utah Jazz will be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs this year, because Gobert is a clumsy oaf and Donovan Mitchell is overrated. Also Conley is washed and Jordan Clarkson needs to eat a fucking hamburger if he wants to be a durable off the bench scorer.   Also, nothing really gives me joy the way watching the Jazz choke does. The way that team quits on each other during the game is just \*chef's kiss\*"
"theres no fucking way that's his ""ceiling"" If someone's ceiling is Jordan Clarkson, they don't get taken 2 overall in a strong draft. That basically implies it's not realistic for him to see improvement in the defensive side of the game or his ability to take over an offense."

He has more defensive win shares and a better defensive box plus/minus. He has a better assist to turnover ratio. Jordan clarkson might be a better ball handler. Everything else is objectively false.   Amazing. I **HATE** it when people like /u/MalikMonkHive post a comment full of nonsense, get called out and corrected, and then never address the person who called them on their bullshit.

"Interesting, was reading earlier how Jordan Clarkson was better than Russ."
"Trade for George Hill, Rodney Hood, and Jordan Clarkson"
Random but for the longest time I couldn’t tell the difference between George Hill and Jordan Clarkson because of that team
"He needed a center that could space the floor and was playing for one of the best offensive coaches ever. Harden was also still our best player, he just deferred to Westbrook bc he makes the team worse anytime the ball isn't in his hands. Jordan Clarkson is a significantly better player at this point Westbrook isn't a 6moy contender in this league."
"So i used to watch the Lakers pretty regularly. And you can check out my post history to see if im qualified to talk about coaches.   Luke Walton was one of the worst coaches i have seen purely based on on court product.   His Xs Os are extremely simplistic leading with one action and no weakside or offball actions to setup counters to defensive counters. This means if the action is stopped, the play is dead and often in the old Lakers days this meant Jordan clarkson iso. Or Nick Young.  In fact, i dont remember the exact specifics but i predict if you look at the Lonzo era stats the team was probably #1 in transition offense and dead last with a half court set.  I remember Larry Nance Jr the first year without Walton saying in an interview how practices were very different than previous because they were much more structured.  I think Luke is a great player development coach, because by all accounts Draymond Green credits him with his development. Which i can see as a pinch post, triangle postion passer. But he’s not head coach material and it was evident from early in his Lakers tenure."

"This sub doesn't even know what Poole's game is, why are you even asking? They don't know his underrated strengths or his weaknesses, this sub probably thinks he's just a 6th man scorer and his ceiling is Jordan Clarkson or something. Of course casuals just go by the name Westbrook. Not saying he doesn't have a case but people here probably don't have an educated opinion."
"He was covered with five pies worth of used blueberries. The women in the audience screamed. Bossman Donovan Mitchell took one look at Jordan Clarkson and barfed on Coach Snyder.   Coach Snyder barfed on the assistant coach that was sitting next to him. Slamson barfed on his wife's tits! But when the smell hit the crowd, that's when Lukes' plan really started to work.   Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends. Kids barfed on their parents. A fat lady barfed in her purse. The Morris twins barfed on each other, and the Women's Auxiliary barfed all over the Benevolent Order of Antelopes.   And Luke just sat back and enjoyed what he'd created... a complete and total barf-o-rama!"
Jordan Clarkson my dude
Jordan Clarkson. Poole is not quite the athlete but a bit better shooter and has more room to improve. Their games are pretty similar though right now.
"*Jordan Clarkson runs back on defense signaling 3 with his fingers*  *Larry Nance Jr dunks on someone and gives him a stank face*  *LeBron drops 53 at the Finals, but JR Smith forgets the score and clock*   Yeah, what about it?"
"Jordan clarkson. Really he’s the one who did a 180 though. I used to think he was so bad and boring and he pretty much was, then completely became a new man with a new game in Utah and is now one of my favorite players."
&gt; Jordan Clarkson is a 6MOY player.  We didn't trade Jordan in that trade we traded for him and he was just sucked until he developed here.
Yeah but let’s be honest wouldn’t you rather have Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson? /s
Jae Crowder has consistently won in every team he has been to besides the Cavs.   Jordan Clarkson is a 6MOY player.   Rose is now closing games with the Knicks.
"Conley’s impact this year has really shown up when you look at the lineups. The Jazz essentially runs three different groups each half- the starters, then a Mitchell-Whiteside led group, A Rudy-Conley group-Mitchell-Whitside again and then the starters to finish.  That third group so far has basically always had Rudy Gobert, Eric Paschall (though probably now Rudy Gay), Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson. The difference between have Conley with that group vs anyone else is staggering. These are the lineups with those 4 (Rudy Pashcall Ingles Clarkson)  Conley- +11.3 net rtg (113 min)  Butler -4.3 net rtg (21 min)  Forest -12.7 net rtg (21 min)   Mitchell -64 net rtg (8 min)  Conley’s ability to floor general that unit in particular is so incredibly valuable."
"the clippers are just really good defensively.   ingles was flat out shut out of that series because he was the worst athlete on the floor, the Clippers have 8 guys that can guard him and they're all better athletes.    mitchell couldn't really run point like he sometimes does because his ankle was too far gone.    niang was incompetent with the ball in his hand.   the Clippers kept breaking down the offense and turning it into iso ball because we didn't have the ball-handling to run the pnr properly and get the ball to Gobert. then of course if your offense is one-legged Donovan Mitchell, Bogie and Jordan Clarkson iso-ing against a good defense the result of that is going to be a little bit up and down lol."
"There may be something to this. Looking at the stats, it looks like on average, defenders are taking more 3s with ""Very Tight"" defense  Jordan Clarkson is shooting 60% on those, nice"
He's Jordan Clarkson but worse
Friendship with Jordan Clarkson over. Rudy Gay is 6MOY now
"It was something like:  OUT:  Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, Iman Shumpert  IN:  Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr,  Rodney Hood, George Hill,"
he’s closer to a jordan clarkson than whatever they’re trying to make him be
"Well 12 states don't have mandated vaccines. Kyrie value did go down but is still talented to take a risk.   The notable names are Utah and Georgia. I don't see kyrie fitting with Luca in Texas and Miami has Lowry. Arizona has cp3.   A sign and trade for Mike Conley, and jordan Clarkson might work.    Atlanta Bogdan, cam reddish and lots of picks  or hueter, Bogdan and like 2 picks"
He's 21 and he's better than Jordan Clarkson already lol
More like Jordan Clarkson 3.0.
"Jordan Clarkson as a Cav was devastating to watch every night, but love him flourishing in Utah. He was a fine tank commander in hindsight"
Oh whoops forget it then. Wonder who would be the third best player then. Jordan Clarkson?
Anyone here wanna soft stroke my Jordan Clarkson? My Jordan clarkson is so fkin hard right now. My Jordan clarkson wants a little friend.
"I think the song being named after him is sort of a symptom rather than a cause but I see what you’re saying. I would say someone like Jordan Clarkson (also spent time in a massive market) kills guys off the bench, is a microwave scorer, but doesn’t have people fawning over him in the same way that Tyler does. He is still well known, but the media attention isn’t there.   It’s hard to quantify this stuff because there is no control group: in order to have irrefutable proof, we would need to compare against a universe where Tyler Herro is black. But the next best thing we can do is observe how our culture discusses white and black players.  Tyler, Luka, Jokic, even Caruso. In my observation, there is extra hype around them (even if they are generationally talented) compared to some of their black counterparts."
"Jordan Clarkson is your man, he is damn fun to watch when he is cooking"
Jordan Clarkson
Moving forward I'd probably say Coby. Sounds like they're going to throw him into a Jordan Clarkson/Tyler Herro role.   White's a known product at this point and I think he is what he is.
Green has way better athleticism and size than a guy like Jordan Clarkson.   Green's most likely fail case is if the jump shot never comes together.   Green is already showing better ability to get to the basket than Jordan Clarkson as a significantly underweight 19 year old.  He could grow another inch and gain 20-30 pounds in the next few years and suddenly he's looking like the next Paul George or Tracy McGrady.
"Just tuned in, are the stats bugged?  It says jazz starters have 3 points or under and Jordan Clarkson has 16."
Jordan Clarkson is shooting 23% from 3 so far. That’ll almost definitely rise but he probably won’t crack 30% by season’s end. Seems really affected by the new ball. Not ideal for somebody that takes more 3s per 36 than anyone not named Steph Curry.
"&gt;""A decade of stagnation"" is such a reductionist and lazy take. There's no way we would have extended him for 4/$54m if he was as disappointing as you seem to believe. He's been genuinely brilliant at times for us, and still has value in this league.  I've never doubted he's a good player.  But you seem to think has value = worth a first.  Guys like Danny Green, PJ Tucker, Jordan Clarkson and Jae Crowder have all been traded for less.  Danny Green + offloading 30m in bad money = a 1st.  Ross still has value in the league, but a 1st is a ludicrous price for a bench spark plug.  Why would teams spend a full 1st on a role player when there are comparable decent players available for cheaper?  Would you put Terrance Ross on the same level as someone like Clint Capela?  Because Atlanta only spent a 1st on Capela.  &gt;Him ""realising his full potential"" - whatever that is - is also a moot point. Who cares.  &gt;The only thing that matters is the player that he's become.   100% agree and that's exactly what I've been saying.  You kept saying he could be this, he could be that.    *""I could certainly see one of the main contenders rolling the dice and giving up what would be a late 1st rounder.""*  ...  *""what TRoss could bring to the right team""*   Who cares?  Teams don't roll the dice on 30 year olds. His value is entirely based on his past production. Potential doesn't factor in.  He is what he is, which is decent but still not worth a 1st."
DeAndre Jordan? Jordan Poole? Jordan Clarkson? Which Jordan man?
"No idea, but Jordan Clarkson is part Filipino as well."
"i guess it depends on your definition of volume, but bledsoe doesn't shoot that many threes imo.  for this stretch of the season, it's got to be dame or jordan clarkson.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=FG3A&amp;dir=-1"
"lol, he's actually kind of not.  i guess tonight's games aren't factored in yet, but he's only 7th in 3PA.  1st and 2nd are steph and buddy hield and their 3P% are _ok_ (38.5% which is only bad because it's steph, and 39.1% for buddy) but everyone from 3rd to 7th in attempts is shooting from 23.4% (jordan clarkson) to 34.3% (anthony edwards).  i think duncan will still be above clarkson in 3P% after tonight since he was 2/10 in the pacers game.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=FG3A&amp;dir=-1"
"""yall got any more of those hawks games?"" -jordan clarkson"
Exactly. From what I’ve seen he’s a better Jordan Clarkson offensively and a much worse defender so basically the perfect 6th man.
DLo is arguably worse than Jordan Clarkson at this point. Clarkson actually puts up a fight on defense
"&gt; but i could see that being ideal for DLo  Yes. But not for the team. Steph is better than D-Lo (Klay's partner) and so is Middleton (Dru's partner). Anyway you slice it, D-Lo is not a great fit if you want to win games. He should probably be more of a 6th man coming off the bench like Utah has with Jordan Clarkson."
"Lonzo, Caruso, Ingram, Jordan Clarkson…. We’re over top about our guys cause they end up ballers"
JP profiles as a career 6thman in a Lou Will/Jordan Clarkson role. I don't think his shot selection will let him be more on a healthy contender
"ha ha I do love me some chicken.  My wife is not a fan of replacing thanksgiving turkey with chicken - she just doesn't get it.    I have to say, whether the narrative of utah is true or not, I love the shift we're seeing with Donovan mitchell and D-Wade coming here and embracing the place.  Mike Conley and Jordan Clarkson sign new contracts with us and we recruited Whiteside and Rudy Gay.  No one wants to shed the idea of us hating on black people more than the average fan who just appreciates good dudes playing good ball."
"In terms of ability, yes. However, take ability and price tag into account and I think he's right. The difference between Rubio's salary and DLo's salary is a Jordan Clarkson or a Derrick Rose or a Marcus Smart or a  Pat Bev.  Once you factor in DLo's 29.5m price tag and I'll take Rubio and Clarkson. I'll take Lonzo + Caruso. I'll take LaVine + Seth Curry. I'll take Murray and Rose."
"Yup you’re absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"
Jordan Clarkson makes it cool to be a 6th man
"🧢   That take is dated. The west is wide open and it’s not top heavy like before. Hell the warriors are 9-1 with a very modest lineup. The Mavs are 7-3 with an even less talented roster. Dame is supposed to be just behind steph and Luka, and even then CJ is supposed to be better than Wiggins and certainly better than Jordan clarkson or *Jordan Poole*.   So no. Any team led by a star in the west really doesn’t have an excuse to be bad"
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
"Russ is better though, he can get the whole bench unit involved while Jordan Clarkson can only get himself involved"
No. Jordan Clarkson is a skilled scorer. He can actually shoot. Russell is not. At all.
... with a Jordan Clarkson contract.
He might be okay in a Jordan Clarkson role maybe.
"Philippines? Lakers, Heat, or wherever Jordan Clarkson is playing (Jazz) will be your team."
By that standard the easy choice is the Jazz since so is Jordan Clarkson + Clarkson played on the Philippines National.
Pick the Jazz we have Jordan Clarkson of course  we're the pinoy team of choice by far
LeBron and AD  But I adore past bromances like Lonzo and Kuz Nance and Zubac Hart and high fives Kobe and D'Angelo D'Angelo and Jordan Clarkson Kobe and Pau
Jordan.    Clarkson.
Pro: Jordan Fucking Clarkson 😤  Con: No Lu Dort 😔
"I mean, if you think of every player as a product/project you should be measuring everything right?  * Your first set of data is biometric. Height, weight, body fat %, wingspan, illness, injury history, maybe even combined with stuff like vertical, sprint speed, movement on court etc.   * Second set is on-the-court production: regular stats, shooting %, advanced stats, lineups all that shit   * Third set is their value: you have the cost of acquisition, current rate, and then it makes sense to turn all of those potential trades into a value column and track it over time.   Take Jordan Clarkson for example.   Cost to acquire was literally some cash. Trade value ended up getting a 1st round pick with expiring contracts attached.   You could probably track the trade proposals from other teams and see a rise and fall in that category and even have markers that would say, ""you need to at least get a 1st rounder from him"".   I mean that's just the way things seem to be going in sports. Is that you can put in some nerds and figure out shit like this. At the end of the day you let the bigwigs make the calls, but I wouldn't want to be flying blind into every contract, trade discussion, and going off of ""muh gut""."
Jordan Clarkson fits better the classic role this awards tends to reward. But I think Boucher all around has been better
The issue is this is James harden. If it were Jordan Clarkson he was getting ejected. The league wouldn't let the ref eject harden. Stars have too much power. That being said I agree with you and there are far too many people comfortable with a man slapping another man's butt without any permission here.
"Darius Garland,  Jordan Clarkson,  Jerami Grant,  Christian Wood,  Chris Boucher."
right now though I'd say Jordan clarkson has a better case. though maybe the Jazz decline a bit then it will get quite interesting
Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan fucking Clarkson 🤦‍♂️
Michael jordan Clarkson lol I like it
"Shake Milton and Jordan Clarkson are gonna be neck and neck. Also, if Lamelo stays on the bench as the 6th man lowkey he could win it too."
" No Bol Bol. No MPJ. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY. Azubuike wins ROY playing garbage minutes in the 4th because we are up 20 at that point anyway. Teams forfeit in the playoffs rather than go against the Jingler or the fucking Minivan. Mike Conley and Daddy Favs become the first co-Finals MVPS as they wipe the floor with the Charlotte Hornets, while Haygood breaks his finger in game four while down 20, destroying any chances that they come back. Jazz Basketball is officially back."
How do I get a Jordan Clarkson flair?
Jordan Clarkson popping off this game
Michael Jordan Clarkson
"The second option on the Jazz is Conley who was pretty streaky last year. The 3rd highest scorer is Jordan Clarkson who gets his points off the bench against the opponents 2nd unit. Compared to other young stars in the league, Mitchell's doesn't have the best help on offense. The overall Jazz team is pretty good, but as far as offense goes Mitchell is by far the best person to take the shot when he's hot. Other teams don't have to force as many shots to their best player because their second star is better offensively like Jokic/Murray, Tatum/Brown, Brogdon/Sabonis, or Luka/Porzingis."
"Old Jordan Clarkson, his shot selection has improved a ton at the Jazz"
Jordan clarkson as well.
"Jordan Clarkson (not a star). But he’s allowed to chuck for Utah and is pretty efficient and it does help the Jazz a lot. So maybe because it’s encouraged for him to do so, it might not be selfish."
Mike Conley  Jordan Clarkson
"I assume it’s because most games end up with a garbage time 4th quarter so players that are both good enough to make rotation yet bad enough to play with the garbage squad have more of an opportunity to play 4Q minutes than someone like KD, who would only play late into the 4Q if the game is close towards the end.  At least that could explain Jordan clarkson lol"
"Exactly. It's a quirk that his team can scheme around. In exchange, he is a player with a super unique skillset combined with his size. It is incredible that peoples biggest criticism of him is his shooting... he can become a better offball player, add a floater, maybe get more midrange attempts, attack the paint more, etc. He has incredible vision and a handle at 6'10. Dude is a beast at drawing guys in. Not sure why the general nba collective wants him to play like Jordan Clarkson"
"I would maybe slow down with 6MOTY talk as handsome and good at basketball as he is. He certainly is climbing the ladder, especially as the Harden trade and related roster shakeups may pull a couple of guys out of bench roles, but I don’t know if it would be fair to say he’s been better than Jordan Clarkson, who is the top bench offense option for Utah and has been showing big effort and improvement on defense over the course of the season. Terrance Ross has been scoring well for a pesky Magic team. The Ball brother appeal (as goofy as it is) and ESPN’s unceasing boner for him make LaMelo a contender. I think “looking like a 6MOTY contender” would be a far fairer frame for this post."
"Yes, because Steph and Klay are in the same tier as George Hill and Jordan Clarkson. You are a genius."
He couldn't make it to the finals with prime Westbrook forget about broken Kevin Love and Jordan Clarkson.
"Levert isn’t all that great. There are so many of him in the league. Empty calorie mid-range jump shooters that are just average from three, don’t get to the rim, and don’t play defense. Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay, Will Barton, Evan Fournier, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks, Malik Beasley, etc, etc."

Trae Young is paid nearly half the salary of Jordan Clarkson. Would you really pass up trading Clarkson for Trae + 5M freed up salary to spend on whatever you want for Dort?
Jordan Clarkson did no such thing!
" No Bogdan. No Trae. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY.

"A- Lebron delivered a championship to every city he’s played in. That matters. He left in free agency not by demanding a trade that matters. He left if he was unhappy with the roster moves a team made.  B- The trade you are referring sent out Dwayne wade, Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas Iman shumpert Derrick rose and Jae crowder. They received Jordan Clarkson, Larry nance jr, George Hill, Rodney Hood and the draft rights for an overseas player. This trade made them both younger and healthier.  C- the trade was for 3 picks and two swaps. If it continues to work out and the lakers are better than New Orleans, those swap can be nothing Every trade you referenced is factually incorrect.  And to reiterate, it does matter if it worked out. Ask the fan bases involved. It probably feels a lot better to have made whatever trade(and lebron trades were focused and on what actually makes the team better not who he didn’t like in the locker room.) and won a chip than make several trades and have harden kick you in the nuts with his trade demands out the door."
There are people who would rather have Jordan Clarkson.
Rodney Hood in 2019 and Jordan Clarkson last year cooked us
"A friend and I call Jordan Clarkson ""Dollar Store Kobe"""
"To me it’s a reactionary “get out of my way so I don’t trip over you even more” shove, yes Clarkson is annoyed by it, but I think the shove is more than anything to get him out of his way and not run him over even more because the ref apparently had no interest in doing so on his own. I think that’s exactly what Jordan is trying to argue to him afterwords too."
"True. Lakers recently have done well too with Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma and Talen-Horton Tucker all taken late"
You got Jordan Clarkson spelled wrong.
true but its our secret weapon that we dont talk about  (actually jordan clarkson is the true secret weapon but you cant tell anyone about that)
jordan clarkson is fucking raging bro
More like 5+ years of Jordan Clarkson
"Utah's pretty good anytime they're picking outside the top 10. Stockton, Malone, Mark Eaton, Gobert, Mitchell, Millsap, Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, CJ Miles, Mo Williams and the GOAT Andrei Kirilenko are all late first or second rounders.  But inside the top 10 they have a hard time. Dominique Wilkins was the third pick but didn't want to be in Utah. Thurl Bailey was good at seven. Deron Williams was really good but they could have had CP3. Hayward was a good pick at 9 but they could have had PG13. Kanter was picked ahead of like 3 or 4 potential HOF players, and Exum was a gamble that made some sense but in retrospect was a waste of an opportunity when Marcus Smart and Julius Randle were the next two picks, and Jordan Clarkson - who the Jazz traded Exum for last season - was picked in the second round."
"People underestimate how fast the NBA changes.  5 years ago, 2016, the Lakers for example had Kobe, Lou Will, the artist formerly known as Ron Artest, Jordan Clarkson, Roy Hibbert, and D'Lo..."
You forgot to say that Sixth Man of the Year Frontrunner Jordan Clarkson is now averaging 17 a game in 50/40/90 split
I swear everytime I watch Jordan Clarkson he absolutely cooks the defense for like 28 points in 25 minutes.
"Jordan Clarkson gets my vote so far. He is a walking bucket much like Lou Williams. Doesn't give you much on defense but his offensive game is so good your team gets that spark.  Just also want to mention Bobby Portis on the Bucks. Not going to win it this year, but he's bought into the system and playing really well."
"I've legitimately seen Lin fans argue he was a top 2 SG but had his career side-lined by other stars and coaches.   It's like, he had a 2 week hot stretch and was a role player outside of that.   * His defence at best was only ever passable * His decision making was sub par * His playmaking was sub par * He was a scorer who didn't score efficiently or consistently * He was a scorer who struggled to shoot and relied on his driving/slashing ability, but also could only drive to his right  Plus, he feeds into it with the whole ""I work harder than anyone else in the league"". If that were true his game wouldn't have so many holes in it.  He's a less consistent and less efficient Jordan Clarkson."
"Here are Clarkson and Patty's averages so far this season, as well as 3 other players who I think would be top 5 in 6MOTY voting if the season ended today.          |Player|Tm|G|GS|MP|FG%|3P|3P%|FT%|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| :--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |**Jordan Clarkson**|**UTA**|**11**|**0**|**24.3**|**0.500**|**2.8**|**0.437**|**0.933**|**17.2**|**4.5**|**1.6**|**1.0**|**0.3**| |Terrence Ross|ORL|10|0|27.3|0.444|2.2|0.400|0.912|16.5|2.4|1.5|1.4|0.2| |**Patty Mills**|**SAS**|**11**|**0**|**25.5**|**0.479**|**3.2**|**0.473**|**0.941**|**15.2**|**1.5**|**3.3**|**0.3**|**0.1**| |Chris Boucher|TOR|10|0|22.2|0.578|1.7|0.472|0.733|14.3|6.2|0.9|0.6|2.6| |LaMelo Ball|CHO|11|0|25.3|0.413|1.6|0.353|0.720|12.4|7.0|6.0|1.6|0.4|"

Wild guess but Jordan Clarkson is going to maintain shooting 50/40/90 lmao
"That's Jordan ""All Rookie First team 2015"" Clarkson to you!"
I miss Michael Jordan Clarkson
This didn't play out in emails. This played out on public twitter. The only tweet that was deleted was Duncan's.  Essentially this is the timeline:  Nate Duncan goes on Pete's podcast and says Clarkson's contract is untradeable.  A few weeks go by and Nate Duncan puts out his prospect rankings.  Jordan Clarkson gets traded to the Cavs.   Pete jokes about it on twitter. While pointing out that Nate Duncan had said Clarkson was untradeable like 2 weeks earlier as well. This is still on his twitter if you wanna find it.  Nate Duncan sub-tweets Pete about being professional.  Lakers twitter roasts Nate Duncan.  Nate Duncan deletes said tweet.
"Y’all saw like 3 days ago Jordan Clarkson getting a steal, the ref getting in his way and Clarkson ending up losing the ball. He softly pushes the ref and says like “cmon man” and the ref give him a T lmao"
did this guy just say jordan clarkson
"Yeah! Just like Caruso, Kuzma, Jordan Clarkson, Zubac, Larry Nance Jr.   Wait"
I'd add Jordan Clarkson and Thomas Bryant to your list of unexpected gems drafted by the Lakers. Even Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk may continue to develop into something special as a sharpshooter a la Seth Curry in this league.
"Automatic buckets, guys like Jordan Clarkson, Kyrie Irving, Lou Williams, Kevin Durant etc who can create their own shot consistently and just score from literally anywhere on the court in a great variety of ways."
Michael Basketball Jordan Clarkson
Former LeBron James teammate Jordan Clarkson
Put some respect on the greatest Jordan of all time. Mr. Clarkson.
“Which Jordan are we comparing him to? Jordan Clarkson?”
Jordan Clarkson should be a 6MOTY candidate. Nearly 17 ppg on 50% FG. Instant offense
I often think George Hill and Jordan Clarkson are the same person
Like CJ McCollum meets Jordan Clarkson vibes.
fucking Michael Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson
Nothing like getting cooked by Jordan Clarkson
Hey guys is jordan clarkson gonna get 6MOTY?
Not fair when the Jazz have 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson putting up 26 without trying
"Watching this game, if you told me the two best players in the NBA were Giannis and Jordan Clarkson, I would believe it"
Is Jordan Clarkson the best player in the NBA?
You forgot Jordan Clarkson
But do you know our Lord and Savior Jordan Clarkson?
"*The Jazz Bench*: Joe Ingles, Jordan Clarkson, Derrick ""Playing For"" Favors, Jordan Fucking Clarkson, J.F. Clarkson, Jordan F. Clarkson, The Second Coming of Jordan, Clarkson."
"Yeah, my thoughts exactly. I know there was some hype when he was 15-16, then I caught one or two of his games in some youth championship, didn't see anything special.   &gt;If there's going to be a filipino in the nba, best bet would be a guard  This makes sense, until then at least you have Jordan Clarkson."
"Ever since we got rid of Jordan Clarkson and let Sexton perform his role, he’s been great. 36 games were played after the trade last year and his splits were 49/43/86, and then this year with 53/50/82.  Dude’s just an efficient scorer regardless of what else is going on"
-Whatever the best James Harden is  - whatever the best ginobili is -2016 Draymond  -2019 Ibaka -Best Houston Battier  -Steven Adams -Jordan Clarkson -Kuzma (FKK)
"He was 8-23 from the field and 2-10 from 3 in that game.  He hit a big shot I’ll give you that!  However, he didn’t crush anyone scoring 20 points off 23 shots.  You could easily formulate an argument that Gobert is the best and most important player on the Jazz, and furthermore I would argue that if Jordan Clarkson got the green light and usage rate Mitchell got, their numbers offensively would be extremely similar, just my opinion, you don’t hate to agree with that but it’s not crazy that’s for certain."
"Terrence Ross on Magic, Murray on Nuggets, Klay, Wiggins (I still believe in him - especially if vs OKC), DLo, PG13, Tatum or Brown (if one is injured and they get a bunch of shots), Jimmy Butler (man scored 40+ in the finals), Westbrook, Embiid, Seth Curry, Kevin Love (hot take but if healthy sure), fucking Austin Rivers, John Wall ( I’m still a believer), Donavan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams"
"Exum - Plays on the Cavs; Jazz traded him for Jordan Clarkson. Rotation player at best.  Jahlil - Third stringer on the Pistons; only good in very situational matchups. Could be out of the league soon.  Mudiay - Currently not playing in the NBA. Struggled in Utah although I think Utah should've kept him because they really don't have a backup point guard right now.  Stanley Johnson - Somehow got a player option on the Raptors; good wing defender but zero offensive presence. Raptors may need a guy with a skillset like him or he could be out of the league.  Justise Winslow - Has been injured for what seems like a year now on the Grizzlies. Hopefully he'll get a chance in their starting lineup but he's starting to look like a bust.  Dragan Bender - Bust, out of the league  Kriss Dunn - Third stringer on the Hawks now. Injured, but may see time for his defensive skills.  Thon Maker - Third stringer on the Cavs, may be out of the league soon.  Skal - Out of the league currently, wish somebody would give him a chance as a rotation center though.  Josh Jackson - Had a small resurgence in Memphis but signed with Detroit I believe. Could continue to develop as a rotation wing there.  TJ Leaf - Got salary dumped to OKC and then waived. Good riddance.  Okay I'm done."

"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
It should be. Honestly the league loves the clippers but Jordan clarkson accidentally runs into the ref and gets fined $25k. Jokes
"In the geeky podcasts I listen to, he mainly gets flak for his defense. I think Nate Duncan called him the worst defensive 2guard in the league last season. He is definitely below average, but there are still guys like Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson below him."
"The Lakers have missed the playoffs 11 times total since 1947, have been to more finals than any other team, have won more titles than any other team, and have a reputation over decades of taking care of their stars.   If that's not well run, I don't know what the fuck is. The Lakers are probably the most consistently well run sports franchise in America over the last 40 years.   You idiots latch on to the 5 years the team was bad after the team's franchise player had a career-ending injury and they were tanking to judge the franchise lmao, it's hilarious.   Even then, the assets the team acquired while they were bad were all attractive pieces that helped the team get a star. Jordan Clarkson is a rotation player. Brandon ingram is a future star. Josh Hart is good. Lonzo Ball is good. Larry Nance is good. Randle is good. Zubac was good. Moe Wagner is good. Thomas Bryant is good.   Alex Caruso was developed from a g-leaguer to a fantastic rotation player.  Talen-Horton Tucker is good. The Lakers' scouting found all these guys. Is that not part of being well run? Any team could have had any of those guys and used them.  The Lakers drafted well and made good trades to get out from the terrible Mozgov and Deng contracts. They didn't get a single free agent meeting when they were terrible. Only once ownership changed and the team improved did they even have a chance at LeBron. The league is a meritocracy; when the Lakers were bad they couldn't even get a meeting with LaMarcus fucking aldridge of all people.   You guys shat on all the moves Pelinka made last off-season and look what happened? The team won a title and was built extraordinarily well. Then he turns around and makes smart moves *again* to make the team better.   I'm not trying to hear any salty fucking nonsense about the Lakers not being well run. This isn't Mitch Kupchak and Jimmy Buss' regime anymore. The new management has consistently made the right decisions and turned the team around. The scouting department hit on pick after pick after pick. Keep holding on to those 4 or 5 years when the team was bad because you're showing your age. The Lakers have consistently been excellently well run, and it will continue now that Pelinka and Jeanie ousted those fucking bozos."
A) LeBron James  B) Christian Wood  C) Patrick Williams  D) Giannis  E) LeBron  F) Lakers vs. 76ers  G) Lakers  Bonus:  6th man - Jordan Clarkson  COTY - Doc Rivers  Executive of the Year - Pelinka
"&gt; I think they should have developed Zubac with Lebron.  While they would have done well together, lebron's not gambling on the development of young players anymore. He's done it time and time again and they just fail him in the playoffs. It's not that they are bad players, but it's a lot of pressure for what is essentially still a kid in the eyes of lebron. E.g. Jordan Clarkson with the cavs. Great player, just couldn't pull it together and find his shot."
"jordan motherfucking clarkson. the dude lives for incredibly tough shots, and makes them. kobe rubbed off on him a bit."
jordan clarkson
"Playing in the US professionally (like any NBA team that isn't the Toronto Raptors) is not what determines which international team someone can play for. For the most part, people play for the national team of the country they have citizenship with. There have been some exceptions like KAT playing for the Dominican Republic and Jordan Clarkson playing for the Philippines, but citizenship and national team play go together in most cases."
"Statistically, Kobe Bryant is an inefficient volume shooter. A career 44.7% FG, 32.9% 3FG, and only 83% from the free throw line. Would you say he's a bad shooter? No, he's not a bad shooter.      Statistically, Thiago Splitter had a better on/off rating in 2011-2012 than Lebron James did in 2017-2018. When on the court, the Spurs were 10 points better(+10) per 100 possessions with Splitter on the court. When off the court, the Spurs were only 3 points better(+3.3) per 100 possessions. You can't say Splitter carried the Spurs harder than Lebron carried the Cavs.     My point being that +/-, and Net Rating, is good at showing team-based performance. But more specifically, it's not good at showing individuals performance. This is because the rating is heavily dependent on lineup, or in other words, who you're playing with. Lebron's team in 2017-2018 was the biggest shitshow of a team to make it to the finals. I'd say bigger of a shitshow than Lebron's 1st Cavs team. At least they had a purpose. Half the 2018 Cavs team, including DWade and DRose, was traded at the deadline for largely crap in return, not much of whom stayed on the roster the year after. George Hill, Rodney Hood, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, none of these guys are all that good. They're DECENT, mind you, but none of these guys can really step it up and ""carry"" a team."
"Cavs didn’t have Kyrie when they went to the finals in 2018 lol. They did lose beasts like Rodney “anxious” Hood, and Jordan Clarkson"
"T Ross, Jordan Clarkson, Shake Milton, D Rose in no particular order"
"To begin, they are really really really good. The best jazz team possibly ever. What it all depends on imo is if they can keep the first seed, idk if they have the capability to beat clippers/lakers in back2back series. But if they are able to stay 1st in the west and either play lakers or clippers they are very capable of going to finals/win nba championship. I’m definitely not saying they would be favored but there is a good chance. And to people saying “2nd round exits like every jazz team” this year is very different, Mike conley is playing way better basketball this year than last year. Rudy and Donavon have elevated their game. Jordan Clarkson scoring 17 ppg off the bench easily leading 6 moty. They have 5 players that can score 25+ any given night. They were a buzzer beater rimmed out shot away from making the second round last year and that was without a 20 ppg (2nd leading scorer on team) player in bojan bogdanovich. Picking back up Derek Favors is huge for when Rudy isn’t on the floor as well. This team is so gd deep it’s insane. Again not saying their favorites but they definitely have a chance and if you disagree you are either ignorant/don’t watch or are just simply hating."
"Thanks, you as well. I was in Cleveland last season? where Jordan Clarkson had a hell of a game. Hopefully the Q will be open soon, if it's not already - I had fun!"
Man I wish the Bucks had a Jordan Clarkson. Guy is a baller.
"No Holiday. No Sam Merrill. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY. Azubuike wins ROY playing garbage minutes in the 4th because we are up 20 at that point anyway. Teams forfeit in the playoffs rather than go against the Jingler or the fucking Minivan. Mike Conley and Daddy Favs become the first co-Finals MVPS as they wipe the floor with the Charlotte Hornets, while Haygood breaks his finger in game four while down 20, destroying any chances that they come back. Jazz Basketball is officially back"
Screw Jordan Clarkson lol

Jordan Clarkson has gone his entire career without passing the ball once when he has a big switched on him
"Alright, every needs to train with Jordan Clarkson."
Jordan Clarkson banged Jada Stevens while he was with the Lakers and now he’s tearing it up on The Jazz. Good looks.
*Jordan Clarkson and Jingles in shambles*
"Love Jordan Clarkson man. Dude is so good, forever one of my favorite baby Lakers"
Do you have time to speak with me about our lord and savior Jordan Clarkson
"I better not hear any blasphemers claiming JC stands for Jesus Christ and not Jordan Clarkson, the actual son of God"
jordan FUCKING clarkson
"Jordan Clarkson is terrifying. Surprised Bucks is hanging in there, feel like the Jazz can’t miss."
I swear jordan Clarkson takes the least efficient shots but makes em so they are actually great
Jordan Clarkson and Luka.
"You meant Clarkson, idk why i thought u were saying Mike Jordan"
"LeBron is the MVP   The Jazz have a case for a few of the lesser awards: besides Gobert DPOY, Quin Snyder as coach of the year, and Jordan Clarkson as 6MOY"
Lakers legend Jordan Clarkson
"I don't think Coby is a pg, as he showed tn. He is better off the ball, and most of his looks came from great ball movement. Sort of reminds me a bit of Jordan clarkson"
"Jordan Clarkson won't pass off as your average Asian dude. When I see Lin, I can delude myself that he's like me, and maybe I can make in to the NBA.  Of course Jeremy Lin is still more athletically gifted than your average American, or any ethnicity for that matter. He just don't look it at first glance."
"Well Jordan Clarkson is only 1/4th Asian, he's as Asian as Jayson Tatum is white.  That being said, we all know it ultimately comes down to looks."
Why the fuck do you guys always erase the fact that Jordan Clarkson is Asian-American
"He’s 22 years old, you guys would’ve said the same thing about Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson just a year ago and they are 25"
yea lmfao his absolute peak would be a Jordan Clarkson type season which ain't awful but he would never have been a superstar.
"Larry Nance, D’Angeo Russell, and Jordan Clarkson"
"He was only here half the year and literally turned the bench around immediately.   Getting Favors back and keeping Clarkson turns the bench into an entirely different beast. At this time last year we were relying on guys like Jeff Green, Emanuel Mudiay, Ed Davis, and even hoping Tony Bradley could develop and help out.  I'll be eternally grateful for Jordan Clarkson getting the rest of our fanbase off of Exum Island and onto Clarkson Cay."
That’s different than what I was saying. The commenter above me said Josh Hart is “Lebron Stopper 2.0”  Jordan Clarkson will never shut down Lebron defensively.
"This. This is just the pieces we thought would fit together last year actually starting to fit. Plus we made some much needed bench changes (Jordan Clarkson and Derrick Favors mostly).  If you had asked me last year what Utah needed in order to become a contender I'd have said, ""Conley needs to figure out our system and our bench needs serious repair"". Well Conley's got it figured out now (best plus minus in the league even) and we have one of the strongest benches in the league.  My boys are looking good, but it's only surprising to people who haven't been following the Jazz (which is fine, I don't follow your teams closely either :))"
"Nah, Jordan Clarkson pushes off and hit the championship winning shot against Russell Westbrook, cementing his legacy as the best Jordan to ever play the game of basketball."
"Jordan Clarkson, Bogey, then 3rd option Mitchell"
Jordan clarkson can jack me off?
Jordan clarkson is going off.
"Jordan Clarkson had hit a three pointer in 50 consecutive games. Before this shot he was 0/6 from three point range before this shot, great way to continue the streak."
Law of averages states that Jordan Clarkson must finally start hitting shots he shouldn't.
"Jordan Clarkson is the best Jordan to ever play the game  Yes, even better than Jordan Hill. I went there"
Michael Jordan Clarkson has logged in
Jordan Clarkson lite
"In scenarios with players like Lin, the question that should be asked is what can he currently contribute to an NBA team?  He was never a particularly good shooter, didn’t defend well either, and wasn’t really much of a playmaker outside of PnRs.   His best trait was his speed/quickness and first step, but that seems to have disappeared due to injury and age.   Maybe a vet mentorship role? But he seems to want playing time.   Role players in the NBA usually have at least one definable skillset that makes them standout, such as Jordan Clarkson with scoring, Tristan Thompson with rebounding/hustle, Rubio with passing/playmaking, JJ Redick with shooting, etc.   Unless Lin has become a sharpshooter or developed some other valuable skillset, he’s probably not going to be make it back in the league."
"Not because he’s worse than Donte, but our bench is trash and him with Bobby could be a great tandem like Jordan Clarkson and Joe Ingles.  Literally the exact same way he’s utilized with the Raps lol."
"this is fucking absurd. i’ve laughed at lakers fans thinking kuzma is better than jordan clarkson, but JAYSON TATUM???"
Experience. Spurs had been on the big stage before. Only guy who’s been in the finals on this squad is Jordan Clarkson and he was pretty much a non factor
Jordan Clarkson is running away with the award.
"Curry and Dante are nice choices, but the most underrated player in the game today isn't on the list. It's Jordan Clarkson. The rest get to much recognition to make the list.  OG isn't our most underrated guy, it's Norm."
Yeah that’s part of it. Plus mike conleys 10+ years of playoff experience and making it to WCS multiple times and the WCF. Plus Jordan clarkson experience with the lakers and cavs. Also haven’t had bogdonavic in the playoffs yet either — he carried the pacers against lebron.  Also James harden knew he’d lose in 4 to the jazz this year that’s why he went east.
not over jordan clarkson
"We're averaging the most 3 pointers per game by any team in NBA history and our rotation players, minus the big men, just shoot an insanely efficient clip on high volume. I'll repost this table from another comment, that's accurate as of the completion of tonights game.     |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
"We've got shooters everywhere that it's kinda ridiculous that Niang is only the 7th best shooter (by % this year even tho he's at 41.0% and 40.0% the last two seasons) in our rotation, apart from Gobert and Favors.      |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
"but our lord and savior Jordan ""Filipino deity of love and vengeance"" Clarkson is here."
So many contenders for the Jordan Clarkson bench player of the game award  - Jordan Clarkson  - Joe Ingles  - Georges Niang  Love it.
Jordan Clarkson   Jalen Green   Kai Sotto   With Spo coaching. The Philippines dream team!
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."
"1) Harden (first option offensive juggernaut)  2) Joel Embiid (defensive anchor and reliable second option)   3) Jordan Clarkson (elite bench scorer)  That’ll guarantee the Raps win the next three chips, no doubt."
Jordan Filipino clarkson
"Donovan Mitchell 100%, he reminds me of that Jamal Crawford kind of player that I'm just not a fan of. Jordan Clarkson has been better this year for sure."
"Imo its the Jazz 100% If Jordan Clarkson wasnt 6th man frontrunner, Joe Ingles would be in the conversation"
Jordan Clarkson Jr
"Jazz are better this season, and it'd be nice for them to make it far.  But I have high doubts in them winning a championship against the LA teams or brooklyn when jordan clarkson is your second leading scorer. Just a big talent disparity."
"Basically, he hurts you in more categories than he helps. You generally face off in fg%, ft%, 3pm, pts, reb, ast, stl, blk, and turnovers. Each category counts for one point, and you obviously want to win in as many categories each week as possible. If you beat your first matchup in 7 categories, your record is 7-2.   In the early rounds, you basically want guys that will put up 20/5/5 or better on good efficiency. Guys like Jokic and Embiid are prime because they usually go like 30/10/5 on 60% shooting and 80% from the line. Curry, Kawhi, KD, PG, Lillard, LaVine are all top tier picks as well.   Russ is a bad pick because he shoots 40% from the field on twenty shots a game, which really drags down your team's overall fg%. His 19 ppg are not worth his crappy efficiency. He also has five turnovers and only one three per game. He's shooting an abysmal 62% from the line. The assists and rebounds are are nice, but he's sub-par in every other category.   I wouldn't draft him even if he was available in the final round because he has such a net negative impact on your stats. There are guys in the middle to late rounds who can put twenty points on better efficiency from the field and line, as well as hit more threes. Guys like Jordan Clarkson and Gary Trent Jr. are good examples.   If you are interested in trying fantasy, you can still do free leagues on Yahoo or ESPN, etc."
This Jordan Clarkson? https://i.imgur.com/xWIaA2u.jpg
"inb4 ""the jazz aren't legit haha told you so herpderp""  Come on now. This is their 2nd loss in, what, 20 games or so? They just started off slow and a veeeeerrrrryyyy good Clippers team did a great job of not letting them recover. Jordan Clarkson shooting like shit from 3 didn't help either but it happens."
Jordan Clarkson :/
Malik Beasley or Jordan Clarkson money.
One Jordan Clarkson please
No one scared of Jordan Clarkson or Rudy Gobert in the playoffs lol
it feels like Jordan Clarkson time
Jordan Clarkson on 13 4 point plays
Thats just Jordan Clarkson being the greatest player of all time tho.
"Jordan Clarkson already 6MOTY.  Also, is your username a Drew McIntyre reference?"
"Will be interesting if Jordan Clarkson keeps it up all year, iirc bench scoring really hurt you guys against Denver.  So far he's proven to be a lot better than I thought."
"What does this have to do with lebron? You lebron haters got to stop using any thing to attack him Jesus  ADs worst season is is better than Jordan clarksons best season, AD was still playing all nba level defense, and was still a dominant scorer before his injury  Jordan clarkson is a great player but he’s not AD, not even this season which is a career season for him"
I wouldn’t take 5 of this season’s Jordan Clarkson for 1 of AD this season. Not even factoring salary.
Yeah it is crazy. AD playing like shit is still a better player than Jordan Clarkson at his best. The talent gap is that big.
He is playing shit on his standarts. AD was best player of the play offs. So people judge him by the standart that he set last year. But i don’t think he plays worse than Jordan Clarkson.
"AD is an elite defensive player, and Clarkson has always been below average.  Big fan of Jordan, but between this year's version of AD and Clarkson I know which one both the Lakers and the Jazz would rather have on their team."
LOL  Let’s see how Jordan Clarkson does on a team as a 2nd option playing 35 mins a game before we talk about all star
"&gt;3 Elite Scoring Options: Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanavic, Jordan Clarkson   “Elite”."
"&gt; 3 Elite Scoring Options: Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanavic, Jordan Clarkson  Holy hyperbole lmao"
Jordan clarkson!
Ah yes AD the guy who’s not having as good of a year as Jordan Clarkson
At the end of [this clip](https://streamable.com/tqdusn) you can see their Western picks. The standouts to me are that Chuck picked Jordan Clarkson over AD while Kenny picked Chris Paul over Donovan Mitchell.
Jordan Clarkson always destroys his hometown Spurs when we play him
Jordan Clarkson isn’t close performance wise to AD this year and certainly isn’t better based on any of the other criteria you mentioned.  I feel like I’m taking crazy pills reading this
"Gimme paraplegic AD over Jordan Clarkson with Kryptonian DNA, no disrespect."
"Gimme AD with a torn Achilles over Jordan Clarkson, no disrespect"
"Does Charles know who Jordan Clarkson is? I bet he has an image of Klay Thompson in his brain. ( I know Klay has not played, it's the joke)"
"Yeah chuck saying Tatum isn’t an all star, has butler in, and said Jordan clarkson is having a better year then AD. Another great tnt broadcast lol"
"Jordan Clarkson, jimmy butter who has barely played, and just some other wild picks"
Chuck thinks Tatum isn't playing like an All Star but Jordan Clarkson is lmao
Tatum hasn’t played like an all star but Jordan Clarkson has lmao. First and last time I’ve watched/listened to these clowns this year.
Mitchell and Rudy 'Gocry' Gobert are getting carried by Jordan freaking Clarkson. I don't care about no 1 seed! Ask the 2015 Hawks...
"Oh yes, beating a Sixers team that is missing it’s best player and best bench scorer because Jordan Clarkson was draining contested 3’s, much impressive, very wow. They certainly didn’t win because of stellar defense from Gobert. They were actually better with him off of the floor entirely."
"Jordan Clarkson is the ""all he needs is a new environment"" MVP right now."

"I hope we get to keep Oubre next season man. He’s getting it together, and maybe he could be that 6th man a la Jordan Clarkson. Even when he’s not putting shots in he’s valuable with his hustle on defense, minus the tunnel vision moments that are getting fewer by the day."
Jordan Clarkson doesn’t give a fuck he’s just going to shoot it.  Still 6th man of the year though
Great pass by Jordan Clarkson
I mean Jordan Clarkson is scoring incarnate.
jfc  jordan fucking clarkson
Jordan Clarkson looks like an NFL wide receiver who tried out for the NBA for fun and ended up being pretty good
Yeah that's coby in a nutsell man. He is basically a 6th man microwave scorer - sort of like Jordan Clarkson in his early yrs. He shouldn't be focusing on playmaking because he can't take care of ball and read the defense - should just be a straight up scorer
Jordan Clarkson type statline
43 points and 0 assists has to be an incredibly unique stat line. Jordan Clarkson just had 40 and 1 and I thought that was crazy
Whoever wins Lou Will vs Jordan Clarkson has to get a new tattoo
He's right behind Jordan Clarkson
You should see the Jazz’ Youtube comment section whenever they post Jordan Clarkson highlights
"As a Cavs fan, LeBron stans are mostly douchebags and talked massive amounts of trash about our team after he left  Stephews are mostly clueless about the game of basketball and I seriously doubt most of them have ever held a basketball   But the absolute worst, most annoying fans on the planet are Jordan Clarkson fans from the Philippines. My goodness, every freaking game “is Jordan Clarkson playing?” “Why doesn’t Jordan Clarkson play whole game?” “Why not starting Jordan Clarkson?” “Jordan Clarkson best player in Cavs ever”  When we traded him to the Jazz, I felt it was beneficial to both sides not only because it gave Clarkson a chance to play in his proper role on a good team, or because we got Exum in return, but because all those fans are now the Jazz’ problem"
"Kyrie Irving Ron Harper LeBron James Brad Daugherty  Hot Rod Williams  Mark Price Jordan Clarkson Kevin Love Larry Nance Shawn Kemp Kyle Korver  The Lakers have insane bigs so it is a massive task keeping Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, and AD at bay so this team is F/C heavy and Price, Love, Kyrie, and Korver might be able to avoid them inside by stretching the court with their shooting  Prime Kobe vs near-prime Harper would be fun to watch. I tip it to Kobe but Harper’s defense gives us our best shot"
"i can't believe i have to explain this to someone on an nba subreddit, but yes draymond can consistently be the warriors most important offensive facilitator. if you genuinely dont understand what he brings to their offense then i dont wanna read anything you write because you dont know what you're talking about. draymond is an elite facilitator lol. his presence in games has literally swung championships. comparing him to jordan clarkson is asinine. draymond has been doing exactly this for the better part of 7 years."
"""It's Jordan Clarkson time""   - ~~Jordan Clarkson~~ Quin Snyder"
Basic conversational skills? How would I possibly think that Clarkson was double covered every single minute he was on the court and then also just took a guess on how many he made? If somebody says to you in real life “man Jordan Clarkson was hitting everything last night” would you respond “actually dumbass he was 8/13” and then think the other person is stupid? Lmao apparently that’s an unrealistic expectation for you to be able to parse that out but whatever you say
"I'd like to imagine that Quin's notebook just had all the Embiid specific game plan crossed out and replaced with ""Jordan Clarkson""."
Jordan Clarkson is very fun to watch. Has quite the spark and flamethrower potential at any moment.
"Greatly appreciate what? Do you not look at the box scores? Is it not the same conversation every single day? It's not like a Jordan Clarkson or Julius Randle who do not routinely drop 40 points, that deserves a thread because there's new discussion to be had. It happens MAYBE once a year. But what purpose does it serve posting Steph's box score literally every game?"
"This was a thrilling game. Ben Simmons had a career high 42 points. Jordan Clarkson had a season high 40 points. Tobias Harris had a season high 36 points. Both teams were shooting lights out and it was some good basketball.  Ben Simmons is pretty unstoppable when he’s driving to the basket. With Embiid out for the game, that opened up the paint for Ben to drive more. This is the aggressiveness that people want to see from him. After the game he said he’s been working on his mental approach. Per espn, he said “Honestly, I’ve been working on my mentality and my mental (approach) a lot these past few weeks. It’s not easy to do that, change the way you play. Certain things in the game come natural to certain people. I feel like I’m figuring it out.”  Jordan Clarkson hit 8 three pointers. And missed only his second free throw of the entire season. Him coming off the bench and immediately hitting his 3’s, including that fast break 3 pointer, brought the Jazz back into the game from being down 14. I think Jordan Clarkson is an extremely valuable piece of this team, definitely the 6MOTY frontrunner in my eyes."
Jordan Clarkson had a better game

"Yet a performance with just 4 points and 1 three more while having less efficiency from 3 gets called ""going supernova"". Not a knock on Jordan Clarkson, stellar performance and I'm aware of the difference in caliber of players, just found it funny that these kind of performances from Curry are so normalized that nobody bats an eye when it happens lmao"
"I think it's funny people are calling Jordan Clarksons performance going ""supernova"" with just  while Currys performance was just another day in the office and nothing noteworthy while just having 1 three and 4 points less with better efficiency from 3. Obviously I'm aware of the difference in caliber of players and that Clarkson did it off the bench, I just thought about it and found it funny"
"That's the problem. He's the number 1 option, has all the green lights for that team, and *still* he's having lower PPG and efficiency compared to this season.  That's why I give credit for the Jazz coaching staff for putting JC in a position to succeed. It's evident that JC's [shot selection](https://www.slcdunk.com/2021/1/19/22229654/utah-jazz-sixth-man-jordan-clarkson-efficiency-god) got better. His 3-point attempts got considerably higher (from 5.8 3PA last year to 8.4 3PA this year). Plus, he's [improved with his defense](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Jordan Clarkson&amp;season=2021) too unlike his Lakers/Cavs days.  Jazz coaching staff defo have a hand in having JC the way he plays today."
"&gt; Easier to be more efficient and better on defense with an actual offense system and competent players around you  True.  &gt; Maybe he could have been producing at the same rate if they were more like Utah?  Maybe. But it's evident that his [shot selection](https://www.slcdunk.com/2021/1/19/22229654/utah-jazz-sixth-man-jordan-clarkson-efficiency-god) got better. His 3-point attempts got considerably higher (from 5.8 3PA last year to 8.4 3PA this year) so in a sense, he's *not* producing at the same rate from usage efficiency alone."
"&gt; On the Warriors, I feel like Jordan Clarkson is easily the 3rd best player behind Curry and Draymond   You can take that flair off now, it's fucking embarrassing the rest of us."
"Am Filipino, can someone give me the context for why Jordan Clarkson is our Deity of Love and Vengeance?"
The Lakers once had all these players together: Julius Randle/Jordan Clarkson/Brandon Ingram/D'Angelo Russell. Possibly three all-stars and one 6th man of the year.
It comes at the expense of Jordan Clarkson dropping 70
Wiggins&gt;Jordan Clarkson. I heavily disagree with your statement that Clarkson would easily be third best on the warriors.
"none  michael baloney wouldn't let beasley or grant dislodge will barton from the starting 5, jordan clarkson would have to be jc for real to make that blind man see"
"I think this is the game plan Snyder has always had, and he finally had the right team for it. The team is built around Gobert, his main role is to protect the rim. However, Gobert absolutely is not a shooter, so we can only rely on 1-4 for outside shooting. The last couple of years we generated a shit ton of open shots, but we never had the players to consistently drain them - Rubio, Favors (as PF starter), Crowder etc. Now all of the starters on the floor not named Gobert are excellent 3pt sharpshooters. The Jazz run a ton of screens &amp; switches, and their ball movement is incredible. Also the bench. Jordan Clarkson is a madman. Favors had only spent 1 season away from Utah his entire career - which was last season. He already has deep chemistry with this core. He comes off the bench and slides into the backup C role, where Tony Bradley &amp; Ed Davis severely lacked last year - defensively and getting boards. Add Joe Ingles and Georges Niang to the mix, and you’ve got a deep team."
"Sends a dead fish to your family. ""Jordan clarkson sleeps with the dishes"""
Jordan Clarkson just loves the game and you see it in how he plays
If Jordan Clarkson don't win 6MOY this league is rigged.
Michael Jordan Clarkson
"It's a meet-me-halfway situation. Clarkson is successful at accomplishing what the coaching staff is asking him, but at the same time, the Jazz are putting JC in a position to succeed.  Now, his [shot selection](https://www.slcdunk.com/2021/1/19/22229654/utah-jazz-sixth-man-jordan-clarkson-efficiency-god) got better. Plus, he's [improved with his defense](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Jordan Clarkson&amp;season=2021) too unlike his Laker days.  In short, they are a perfect match."
"Matured, definitely. The coaching staff has something to do with Clarkson's resurgence, both on offense and defense.  Now, his [shot selection](https://www.slcdunk.com/2021/1/19/22229654/utah-jazz-sixth-man-jordan-clarkson-efficiency-god) got better. Plus, he's also not a one-dimensional player anymore [with his improvement on defense](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Jordan Clarkson&amp;season=2021) too unlike his Laker days."
"Agreed. Obviously Simmons is a high-caliber player in the NBA and is considered a greater talent than Jordan Clarkson, but I think it would make this Jazz team worse"
Favors over Bradley is massive and you didn't even mention Clarkson in your bullet points  -Jordan Clarkson is good at the shooty hoops.
&gt;Ben Simmons good. Utah Jazz good.    and Jordan Clarkson is just GREAT.  What a u/madlad
"&gt;Wasn’t expecting a Ben Simmons vs Jordan Clarkson 1v1 but I’ll take it.    Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris was insane.. They had their best games of the season, just to have Jordan fuckin Clarkson off the bench ruin their night with a 40 bomb.  &gt;  Seems like the Jazz just can't stop winning at the moment.. 2021 is wild"
"Yeah, he never did.  Compare and contrast his buy in and that of Jordan Clarkson. Night and Day."
"The coaching staff also has something to do with Clarkson's resurgence.  Now, his [shot selection](https://www.slcdunk.com/2021/1/19/22229654/utah-jazz-sixth-man-jordan-clarkson-efficiency-god) got better. Plus, he's [also not a one-dimensional player anymore with his improvement on defense](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Jordan Clarkson&amp;season=2021) too unlike his Laker days.  The Jazz system just happened to be a good fit for him, as compared to their abysmal bench offensively ~3 years ago, Clarkson is like a breath of fresh air. But one dimensional player? Ehhhh."
"&gt; Jordan Clarkson (2021 6MOTY favorite)   Technically Washington drafted him, and traded him to the Lakers immediately for $1.8M."
It'd be cooler if Jordan Clarkson hadn't scored 40 points with nine fewer minutes of playing time
Jordan Fucking Clarkson
"Your favorite player's favorite player, Jordan Clarkson."
"People blame everyone around LeBron as if that team was made to function at all. Rag tag thrown together average to good players that were expected to win a championship over night. If you only watched that season you would think George Hill, Jordan Clarkson, and Rodney Hood don’t even belong in the NBA."
"Lol,Who is he kidding? So basically D.Wade would trade his stellar championship player status (When he was playing),With Jordan Clarkson's Status? I mean that sounds great on tv and all but the reality is Jordan Clarkson is a journeyman type player who is still in the process of learning/honing his own game. The difference between now and the past for Clarkson? His confidence,and playing time!"
Who the hell is Jordan Clarkson?
Was he taking shots at Jordan Clarkson ?
Jordan Clarkson
"Jordan Clarkson, ladies want to be with him, Wade wants to be him."
I'd go with Jordan Clarkson and Bojan Bogdanovic.
"I wanna be Jordan Clarkson too, at least that dude has the choice whether he wants to be a Filipino or not"
Everybody wants to be Jordan Clarkson lol
"""IT'S JORDAN CLARKSON TIME""  Jordan Clarkson"
I used to joke that the basketball scene in Along Came Polly was inspired by Jordan Clarkson
That was a great game and a great push by the Jays to try and carry the team. Could've totally won the game if the jazz didn't caught fire in the 4th. But are there any Utah fans here that can agree with me about that Jordan Clarkson 3pt foul should've been an offensive one? That was straight up near groin of Brown.
"I'm pretty sure LeBron could carry any college team to a championship.  On the flip side whose the worst NBA player that can carry a 16th seed, I'm thinking Jordan Clarkson?"
Michael Jordan Clarkson is my favorite player in the NBA. Gimme that jersey
"Jordan Clarkson wears the fleshes clothes, eats at the chilliest restaurants, and hangs with the hottest dudes - Dwayne Wade, probably"
Jordan Clarkson was fighting for a roster spot due to the NBA’s outdated ban on Filipino players
Jordan clarkson was traded to the cavs to play with lebron and he wasnt very good.
"Only player better than him ever is Jordan. Yes, Jordan Clarkson"
does Jordan Clarkson have his mom's face tattooed near his right shoulder
I want to be jordan clarkson too
Joe Ingles + Jordan Clarkson have combined for more points than the entire starting lineup. That's probably not going to cut it...
"Michael Jordan Clarkson, G.O.A.T."
Stop Jordan Clarkson ✋
I just got out of a Thai prison is Jordan Clarkson the best player now?
Give Joe the Jordan Clarkson green light please
"Bro, don't forget about 6th man of the year favorite Jordan Clarkson."
How good is Jordan Clarkson!?
"ah yes Jordan Clarkson is better than KD, Giannis, Embiid, Lavine, and SGA lmaoo"
&gt;	the fact that no advanced metric is perfect in rating players rather than ignoring how Clarkson ended up where he is on the list.  Who said RAPTOR was perfect? There’s no such thing as a perfect model. You were literally just criticizing it based on where Jordan Clarkson was on the list so don’t try to hide from it now.
Jordan Clarkson *has* been more valuable to his team offensively than all of those offensively this year CMV
"EPM is from the old RPM creator and he basically uses a very similar form to it now it's very tried true and solid.   LEBRON publicly publishes all its methodology and its box score prior and also uses luck adjusted data for on/off. It's kind of just a modified version of PIPM that specifically incorporates player roles better which was needed.   RAPTOR incorporates player tracking data which it's still very much tbd on what/if any of it actually helps create a more stable and valid model year to year(using too much playtracking data is part of what screwed up RPM). There are just all kinds of face validity basic tests it fails on top of that. Ex Conley has shared basically &gt;90% of his minutes with Gobert this year if your model cant isolate the defensive impact of Conley from Gobert then your model isnt doing a very good job. Sure enough that's what's happening, Conley has the 7th highest DRAPTOR which is comically high he's fine he's nowhere near that impactful defensively teams like the Heat have targeted him in games this yr. Better models like LEBRON do. Not making proper adjustments for player role is also how you end up with things like Jordan Clarkson having a higher offensive RAPTOR than Kevin Durant."
"Love a metric that puts Jordan Clarkson above KD, Giannis, Embiid, etc.  Keep chasing the single metric holy grail, statisticians."
"The player he is right now will have a long NBA career just by adding better feeling for the game, which comes with minutes played as he grows. But he has the potential to be a jordan clarkson. I said it."
Jordan Clarkson with 21 of those.
The guy is jordan clarkson. And you just contradicted yourself by saying he stopped the fast break when you admitted in your last comment that the fast break was botched. 4 guys weren't stopped. 2 guys were. It's still great defense. And the rest of the team recovered so they got the ball back. Otherwise a basket likely still happens there.
"lol, sometimes I think how your team would look right now if y’all would’ve kept Jordan Clarkson for the 2nd unit."
I wasn't entirely serious here but Draymond just followed the pass. Not much of a no look. And it's jordan clarkson. The guy never passes haha. I should have noticed that the first time watching the video. Still a great defensive okay but there were only really 3 guys invoked including draymond.  It's an easy bucket if JC would consider passing.
TIL Jordan Clarkson would be the equivalent of John Stockton in the EL
*Sad jordan clarkson noises*
Jordan Poole vs Jordan Clarkson
"He’s as versatile as it gets on offense, Suns use him as the back up 5 basically and he’s cooking his match up in the low post, should be top 3 in 6MOTY and probably is 2nd in running to Jordan Clarkson."
"Definitely a good player. Actually stands out more than Siakam when the heat play the raptors as well, I know it’s more of a matchup thing but he’s athletic and sort of has that Jordan clarkson type fearlessness, I remember when he hit a reverse layup on Bam the last game they played I believe, I was impressed"
Would probably be in 6th man of the year talks if  Jordan Clarkson didn't have that on lock.
"Cavs to Jazz: Ya, you can have Jordan Clarkson  Cavs to Rockets: Ya, you can have Kevin Porter Jr."
How? KPJ is a pass first guy looking for mid range and at the rim opportunities. Jordan Clarkson is a pure scorer who comes hard off screens to shoot or plays downhill.
Jordan Clarkson
"Last I checked, 30 was 40% lower than 50, 38 is 24% lower than 50. The difference between Oscar's PPG and Wilt's would be the same as Embiid and Jordan Clarkson."
You are fucking with me right? Jordan Clarkson would have been the third best player on the 76’s. Any team that has Kevin Love and top 3 player of all time can’t be considered a “bad” team.
"Srsly just use their goddam names. Nobody knows who tf JC is. On top of it all, I know he’s a baller but Jordan Clarkson isn’t even a player notable enough to get his own initials like that lol."
Jordan Clarkson
"Not that relevant: but Jordan Clarkson is actually half-Asian (half-Filipino). I haven't heard him mention facing anti-Asian racism, it could be because he doesn't want to say or because most people don't know (just by looking at him, if you didn't know he was part Asian you probably wouldn't guess it)"
I wonder if management is friendly between the teams because of Bron. They seem to get a lot of deals done together.   I'm hoping Quinn Cook can have the Jordan Clarkson story arc!
Jordan Clarkson 🔥🔥🔥
i compare him to guys like Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood.  great guys to come off the bench and get you buckets in a hurry
"&gt;not wanting to be a snitch.  Real truth right here.   Lin knows that the NBA is full of (yes I'll say it) black players who 100% agree with calling Asians 'coronavirus'. Just look at what Stephen Jackson said about Jews and got TONS of support from current and former NBA players.  Lin has always been headhunted and overguarded cause no black player wants to be ""beat by an Asian"".   Hell, just look at the anti-light skin racism rampant in the black community. Ask Black Griffin, Curry, Jordan Clarkson about that. Btw, that was one of Kobe's and KG's go-to insults.   And to further prove my point, there was ZERO, ZILCH, NADA former or current NBA player who came to Lin's defense back during Linsanity or now. Not a single one in 8 years. Steve Kerr is basically the only NBA figure who has."
Bro.  It's Jordan Clarkson.  ... at its not even close!!!
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
Jordan Clarkson has 114 off the bench
"The youngsters showed flashes but were too inconsistent to win. Lonzo was playing well in the second half of his season with LeBron but he got hurt. BI was growing on schedule. Randle got hurt in his first game his rookie season and missed the rest of the year (that really sucked). D. Russell was let go in favor of Lonzo but there was no denying his talent. Larry Nance was an impact player, as was Thomas Bryant. Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart were all promising. I think the Lakers development team did its job, just that these guys were young."
"They’d be a valuable player, yes, but not what I would call a good bench player. They’d be a one-trick pony. Jordan Clarkson is a good bench player. Iggy on the Warriors was a good bench player. Guys who can play 30+ minutes and close games. Our magic buzzer beater player will only contribute to a handful of wins per season at most."
"I was hyped to see our boy Kai Sotto signing for the Ignite. Then some shit happened where he was called up for the Philippine team, which caused him to miss out on the GLeague bubble and eventually cost his spot with the Ignite as well. (To add insult to injury, the FIBA qualifiers he was supposed to take part in were postponed lmao).  While we do have half-Filipino Jordan Clarkson as well as fellow half-Filipino Jalen Green, the ultimate dream is to have a homegrown Filipino in the NBA. I'm bummed af right now thinking about it."
Jordan Clarkson?
Jordan Clarkson syndrome
Your dad deserves 6moy over jordan clarkson
"Reminds me of Jordan Clarkson actually, a really jerky type of drive that smooth on the finish."
"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
Like imagine if booker was drafted by say the warriors he would not be the great player we know today he would probably more like Jordan Clarkson As he would basically never get starting minutes
How about jordan clarkson?
Jordan Clarkson
"Joe Harris, Jae Crowder, Joe Ingles, Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green"
Jae Bossman Crowder. No bias I'd say Jordan Clarkson.
We all know it’s Jordan Clarkson and it’s not close
Then move them up and replace the starters. And find somebody to replace jordan clarkson
"The Iverson led Sixers and Webber's Kings teams. The Sixers, in particular, leaned so hard on Aaron McKie, who was basically all they had. Add Jordan Clarkson and Javale McGee to that team, and they've been hard to beat. Iverson was the ONLY person on that team who could score. The league was very low scoring and defense oriented then, but they just went ALL defense and expected Iverson to score 40 a game."
"If you asked fans last year a few weeks before the bubble, is Miami a legit contender, I think a lot of the responses would be no. And yet Miami was right there in the finals.  So, technically I mean isn’t any playoff team a contender? Isn’t that like the definition of a contender, being in the playoffs means you’re contending for the championship. I mean nothing is a sure thing, see 2016 warriors or 2007(?) Mavs in first round. I know those are like, all-time upsets, but upsets happen in the playoffs almost every year. Everyone was clowning chuck about the blazers a few years back, and then they went and made the WCF  Teams don’t go into the playoffs expecting to lose, everyone thinks they’re a contender. These dudes are professional competitors and have been for probably most of their lives. Nobody’s picking like Washington to beat the Nets, but hey, crazier things have happened. The league is lucky those bubble suns weren’t in the playoffs last year, they woulda taken out the lakers round 1!  Klay is a big piece for the dubs, maybe with him everything just clicks. Maybe oubre is inspired and suddenly shoots 50% from 3 for a 12-game stretch, Jordan Poole becomes Jordan Clarkson and starts taking over games from the bench. Who knows, ultimately though with Klay (all season) that would most likely push the warriors up into at least the 6th spot and out of the play-in  TL;DR: anyone can win in the playoffs"
"&gt;But then this has literally nothing to do with losing those guys.  ?? Yes it does, this whole conversation is about how you are worse after losing those guys. Other teams have been able to replace guys who leave easier.  I don't blame you for trading for Kemba - at least that was an attempt to replace Kyrie, but you didn't replace Hayward, Horford, Morris, or Rozier with good enough players.  Contenders are able to find value in the bargain bin every year, don't give me the whole ""woe is me"" bullshit as if you didn't have options available. Covington was traded for a mid-round first. Horford himself was dumped for nothing. You could have moved Hayward last year before he jet set on you. Dwight Howard is a backup C on a contender, Torrey Craig is a rotation player for a contender, You didn't want to move for Aaron Gordon last year when you had 3 1st round picks for up grabs. Jordan Clarkson went to the Jazz for nothing. George Hill, Delon Wright basically moved for nothing but you went for shitty ass Jeff Teague instead.  Please don't act like there was no alternative. Ainge made some wrong moves in trusting goes, drafted the wrong people, etc and these are the consequences."
"Jordan Clarkson is averaging 17 points on 15 shots with 41/34/92 shooting splits. Shot chuckers usually get the award, but I really don't think he deserves it. If it has to be the Jazz, I would rather give it to Joe Ingles."
"You need Jazz basketball in your life sir. A beautiful utopia that only a serial killer like coach Snyder could make a reality, where both Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson can coexist and thrive!"
"Lmfao no, it’s because you don’t know shit about the Lakers and just hate from a distance. They literally drafted Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball in consecutive years.   They weren’t a dumpster fire because they missed out on overpaying Aldridge or Melo. They were young. They built a war chest of assets and cashed in on them to win a damn championship. If they were a dumpster fire they’d waste all their high picks like Sacramento, Minnesota, Orlando, etc. They attract stars because players know the organization treats players amazingly and will move heaven and earth to field a championship contender. Dumpster fire lmfao you sound like those morons who “protested” outside the Staples Center 😂"
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  Me:  &gt;If you guys drafted such great assets, why did you have to trade so many players and throw in so many draft picks for AD? I’ll tell you. Your assets sucked.   &gt;edit  &gt;Since people seem to disagree... Why did they have to package Lonzo with BI and josh hart, 4th overall pick, 2 FRPs, and a pick swap? Is it because AD is just so valuable? Let's take a look at lakers draft picks and what happened... because I think there's a pattern:  &gt;Julius Randle  &gt;-left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  &gt;D'Angelo Russell  &gt;-traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  &gt;Larry Nance Jr  &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Jordan Clarkson &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Brandon Ingram  &gt;-traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Ivaca Zubac  &gt;-traded for nothing  &gt;Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Moe Wagner  &gt;-5 games with Lakers   &gt;Svi Myhkailuk  &gt;-39 games with Lakers  &gt;Even the players they drafted who eventually became something were absolutely nothing with lakers and dropped for nothing or traded as low value assets."
Jordan Clarkson. Ingles should be the 6th man of the year
Jordan Clarkson isn't even the best 6th man candidate on his own team
Jordan Clarkson. Ingles is a better 6th man candidate
Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Jordan Clarkson -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -traded for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Excellent drafting. How could anyone question your asset acquisition skills.
Jordan clarkson for the most part especially early in the season

It shouldnt but its the same voters that are gonne vote for Jordan Clarkson over way better players for 6moy so who knows
Jordan Clarkson as DWade says
I won't ever forget reading a Lakers fan say Jordan Clarkson would be better than DeMar DeRozan.
The scoring increase is due to the talent increase in the league there is a reason there are more 20 point scorers than ever I'm 100% sure jordan clarkson would have been an all star in the 90s players can do a little bit of everything now
I can’t believe I forgot to add Jordan Clarkson
"If you think founier, rob williams, Tristan thompson is near jordan Clarkson, Joe Ingles, favors, niang, oni I suggest you watch more basketball outside of the Cs..  Rob williams is a very solid bench player. The others are eh"
"Embiid is good, but the players you have around him in that scenario aren't as good as the Jazz. I just think Luka would feast, although I feel he'd kinda overlap with Mitchell. Luka would probably play the point in that scenario, though.  Each player on that Jazz team is a threat. Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart aren't threats like Bogdanovic and Gobert are. Gobert's defense alone can win the Jazz games.  Utah is also just far too deep. Evan Fournier doesn't come close to Jordan Clarkson, in my opinion. Clarkson just fits that system they've got going on perfectly."
"i mean at the time you had an overweight dude from Serbia who had come off of a good year playing in Serbia and who had averaged 3.5 assists. So basically he was closer to a normal center with good passing fundamentals.   Even in his first year in the league you had a guy that was doing 2.4 assists, and while he was very good, was there indicators of him becoming the kind of player he is today (I didn't watch Denver back then). Like even the per 36 numbers his rookie year didn't show that court vision potential off.   For every Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic you end up with a Darko Milicic or Dragan Bender, it's a total crap shoot dealing with the draft and to call these guys idiots when they still had the idea to draft and pick him up still shows that someone viewed him as a prospect with potential.   You can't predict how a player will develop over time, it's pretty idiotic of you to say that these guys are idiots considering they literally have to evaluate 100+ potential players every year that may be worth picking up. 2014 was a draft of underrated gems, Joe Harris and Jerami Grant were both second rounders, Dwight Powell who just put on a show last night with Luka went after Jokic. Potential 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson went at 46. Clint Capela at 25, there were so many great prospects that were drafted all across the board not to mention guys like LaVine and Julius Randle going later in the first round. Everyone is going to remember 2014 for being the a low key bust for the biggest prospects from Wiggins and Parker when in reality it's going to go down as a sleeper draft where some truly elite players went very late in, likely a very difficult draft to call."
"I don’t think he’s gonna fizzle out, but from a playing perspective I’m gonna say Jordan Clarkson"
"My thing is yes Curry helps him, but I think Draymond would help expand any elite scorer, and be insanely impactful it doesn’t have to be Steph. He’d look great with Lavine on the Bulls, and probably drag them to a good defense.   Through most of last season, he wasn’t even playing with a scorer as talented as like a Jordan Clarkson or Tim Hardaway Jr. with D Lo injury, that team was straight garbage."
"This proves that Utah Jazz and Spurs (big 3 era) got a lot in common.  Tim Duncan  = Rudy Gobert (great defender)  Manu Ginobli = Joe Ingles(great 6th man, can run 2nd unit)  Tony Parker = Jordan Clarkson (Can steal your girl)"
MVP - Joel Embiid  MIP - Julius Randle  COTY - Quinn Snyder  6MAN - Jordan Clarkson  ROTY - LaMelo Ball
I just saw that too. He can be there Jordan Clarkson
It’s pretty clear D’Lo is a career backup who can’t stay on the court.  Dudes career arc is going to channel Jordan Clarkson so hard.    Drafting a hometown kid could boost morale that they’re in it for the long haul &amp; totally bought in.   Suggs/Beasley/Ant is interesting.
"I would like to think he will always start all of his posts with ""First off Jordan is the goat I’m not a fan boy"".  For instance:  First off Jordan is the goat I’m not a fan boy. KCP was on fire tonight. I hope he shoots like that in the playoffs.  First off Jordan is the goat I’m not a fan boy. Jordan Clarkson is def the 6th man of the year (this one would be a little confusing)  First off Jordan is the goat I’m not a fan boy. LeBron is the GOAT"
Jordan Clarkson is doing well. The curse wears off after some time.
"Crazy Wiggins health fact. Of players from the 2014 draft, Wiggins has 18185 minutes played for most overall. Second is 2nd rounder pick and 6th man Jordan Clarkson at 13661."
Jordan Clarkson disagrees.
"Top 20ish Donovan Mitchell elevates his game in the playoffs and the Jazz already have a top 15 guy in Gobert. They also have arguably the deepest bench in the league, including two guys in Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson who could be starting for other playoff teams and they will have homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs so they've got as good a chance to won it all this year as anyone else and anyone who says they're not contenders is a clown. They do have one very clear achilles heel though and there's a chance it gets exposed and their success will be matchup dependent just like every other team."

"&gt; There is a grand canyon sized gap between Popovich and those 2 coaches.   At the end of the day, it is about the players and buying into the system and that is exactly what you have in these situations.  &gt;It had 3 hall of famers  3 slightly washed HoF'ers and 1 future HoF. I just got through watching Joel Embiid dominate the Suns. When I watched him, Joel Embiid was doing Joel Embiid things to the Suns like a superstar. It isn't like you had Tim Duncan doing superstar things that playoff and winning. You had a great team play great winning ball making every possession on both sides of the ball count and that is exactly what you have with the Suns and Jazz this year.   &gt; great depth  Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson have been pretty damn great. The Suns Cam Johnson and Cam Payne have been pretty damn great. In terms of [net rating](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StarterBench=Bench&amp;sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1), the Suns have the highest net rating bench in the league while the Utah Jazz are also in the top 5 at number 4. Both of these teams have excellent depth.  &gt;They haven't yet earned that status.  That is the whole point of trying to predict things. It is easy to say someone is a championship player after they are Champion. Everyone can say who is the championship team after the season and the post season is over.   &gt;Regular season is nice  Regular season is the best predictor of post season.  &gt;they need to both prove they can get out of the 1st and 2nd round first.  Great, ya ok lets talk about which team won after they won then. The 2020 Lakers are a Championship team. Bold statement, I know."
Jordan Clarkson AKA the Flamethrower
you missed jordan clarkson
"It’s kind of funny, but my impression is that DLo would fit best as a scoring six man combo guard on a really good team. Just like Jordan Clarkson."
Isn't Jordan Clarkson just way better and more validated than him? Or is he not fully considered.
The pick status and value that were getting in return plus his young age is why we hype him up. We drafted Jordan Clarkson 46th overall in 2014 and he showed the same type of potential as a young player. The dude is now going to win a 6MOY it’s funny how clarkson was seen as overrated and overhyped whilst on the lakers as well. But now he’s seen in an entirely different light.

Looks like a rare good Jordan Clarkson game so far. Still ridiculous by Mark Jackson to declare him a runaway 6moy with the way he's played the last few months. And how Ingles and Brunson have had far more of an impact.
Jordan Clarkson was the 46th pick so he’s almost twice as impressive than Nance by your standards
Clarkson. Nance is the son of an NBA player who had injury concerns. Jordan came out of nowhere.
"Simmons went 3-7 for 9-points and 3-turnovers when going head to head with Rudy. I guess i'll say it again, even though it's not completely true, Jordan Clarkson dropped 40 on Simmons head from the perimeter, Simmons is supposed to be one of the best perimeter defenders"
Jordan Clarkson got pretty overrated for a while.
"Jordan Clarkson has the award locked up already, no ones gonna be able to catch-up when he’s avg 17 ppg+ for the team with the best record in the league. Hart really is a great player tho, 6’5 guard that goes out there shoots 3s and rebounds like a mad man, lots of teams would like to have him"
jordan clarkson also dropped 40 on him
"I hope someone sees this because I want to know if I was the only person who saw this, I only watched highlights. But within the last 15-sec of the game, it was tied at 108. Jordan Clarkson hits a 3, meaning the score should be 111-108, Utah up. The announcer says Jordan Clarkson hits a 3 and the replay shows he is clearly behind the line so no question it was a 3. The score changes to 110 instead and the Schroeder comes down and ties the game with a drive and the Lakers go on to win it during OT. Did the highlights miss something in between Clarkson hitting a 3 and Schroeder making the lay up? Because from what I saw in the ESPN highlights (where the presenter even says, ""the scores tied at 108, Clarkson hits a 3 to put them up. Schroeder comes down and makes a lay in to tie it up with 4 seconds left!) was Clarkson hit a 3 and then Schroeder make a lay up. The math doesnt add up to a tie for me, in that situation.  I just wanna know if anyone else saw this, noticed it or if it was just a mistake of the highlights somehow? I haven't seen any comments about it."

Reminds me of Jordan Clarkson a little bit when he’s on (just plain gets buckets). When he’s off it’s rough lol

JORDAN CLARKSON!
JORDAN CLARKSON TIME
JORDAN CLARKSON
"&gt;if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  what are you talking about? what stat did i use that has that? ts% certainly does not.  and we're not talking about whether or not he can be good or has any potential, i've never claimed that he doesn't, we're comparing him to the players above him who are on the list. scoring efficiency is not the end-all be-all, but when your game is predicated mostly on only being a scorer, it's something important we need to look at.  mikal bridges is a 41% three point shooter with 64%ts, literally one of the most efficient scorers in the entire league and will probably make an all-defensive team this year  john collins scored 21 on 65% ts last season, miles and miles ahead of RJ as a scorer.   deandre ayton an elite rebounder, anchor of one of the best defenses in the league while scoring 15 per game on 62% from the floor  deandre hunter again an elite defender already with 62%ts  lonzo is a much better defender and a better distributor, while being  more efficient.  RJ giving you 17 points on 15 shots just isn't that impressive in comparison considering what else he brings. he could develop into a great player and recently has been looking much better, but you're acting like a spot on this list is owed to him when he hasn't proven anything really in comparison to guys who made it onto the list. he might have a case for an honorable mention or an argument for the last spot on the list, but to act like he's some crazy snub and deserves to be on over the guys you listed is legitimately just a stupid opinion that makes it look like you already were a fan of his and saw ppg and thought that's the only thing that matters."
Jazz really went to a Jordan Clarkson post up lmao
"if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i´ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren´t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"
6'10 Jordan Clarkson vs Real Jordan Clarkson
Does jordan Clarkson starting this game take away his 6MOY powers?
Who doesn’t get amped up on a beautiful Saturday to see the marquee matchup between Andre Drummond and Jordan Clarkson?
He did say he'd come back as Jordan Clarkson if he could
"Shot profile of Jordan Clarkson, hands like Jordan Bell."
1. Jordan Clarkson
"Jordan Clarkson scored 40 points that night, his average is 17."
Jordan clarkson in the car screaming he just wants to see D wade while Rudy govern explains that he has a new family and won’t come by anymore
"He has the same marketability as Jordan Clarkson and Sasha Vujacic. Aka none, and it's just the team they're on"
Or Jordan Clarkson
"In hindsight, that Jordan Clarkson love makes even more sense now"
He really wants to become Jordan Clarkson smh
"I'm glad. I didn't attempt to break any grounds with my insightful commentary. I just have something to screenshot when James Wiseman pops off and NBA Twitter is hounding everyone for bashing him. Happened with Jordan Clarkson when he was on the Cavs then to the Jazz. I also did it with porzingis on draft night. It's fun, sorry I didnt teach you anything new. You did give me some good insight on Wisemans game, gonna watch some film now have a good Friday my man"
"Pelinka: Commence order 66  Wagner: Yes sir.  *Wagner turns to Nance Jr, Jordan Clarkson, Thomas Bryant, Svi, Randle, Ingram, Ball, Hart, D'lo and gives them a nod to start Order 66*"
Maybe Harrell? Jordan Clarkson? Probably Tobias Harris
Sorry I didn’t see Jordan Clarkson in this one...
"LOL @9:08 - ‘Oh my goodness.  Jordan Clarkson almost came in my lap’   ... then immediately realizing what he just said, and face caught on camera doing so"
He only scored like nine points on Gobert. By his same logic he’s a bad  defender as well because Jordan Clarkson scored over 40 points in the same game.. Oh and they lost. But all he cares about are his numbers.
Uh he is kinda wrong. He only scored 9 against gobert.  By his same logic Jordan Clarkson scored 40 on Simmons in the same game.
"I mean, Kemba and Jordan Clarkson are both shooting 10%+ higher than their career free throw percentages. Maybe they got better, but improving that much doesn't seem normal."
"Yeah, it's interesting. For the most part, league percentages aren't high enough to really call attention to, but there are some individual performances that appear to be fueled by empty stadiums.  Like, maybe it will go down, but Jordan Clarkson shooting 13% better than his career average FT% this season feels like a result of no fans."
"He’s next in line for that Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Crawford, Lou Williams type bucket-getter"
"Jae Crowder infamously hated playing for the Cavs and instantly played better after he got traded  George Hill and Jordan Clarkson sucked ass, same with Tristan"
"And they still lost the game, even with Tobi putting up 36 as well. Also, if he says he put that up on Gobert, in the same game Jordan Clarkson also scored 40 on Ben in 29 minutes 13/20 shooting with 7FTA (compared to Ben's 38min 15/26 13FTA and Tobi 37min 14/24 5FTA). Joe Ingles also put up 20 in that game on 8/12 shooting, Donovan 24 on 9/24. By his logic I guess neither of them really deserve the DPOY.     If it was up to me Ben would win the DPOY, but its pretty apparent the league has always favored bigmen in winning that award. I think Gobert still has just as strong of a case as Ben tbf."
&gt; Jordan Clarkson had 40 on his ass  Coming off the bench when Ben wasnt even playing lmao
"Jae Crowder (yes he was traded but he was on that team), Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, Jeff Green, Rodney Hood, Kyle Korver, Larry Nance jr, JR Smith &amp; Tristan Thompson as support around a consistent 3rd option scoring 16-18ppg (there is max 3 teams in the league right now that could say no to such a 3rd option...) in Kevin Love, and THEN you have Kyrie and Lebron. Really don't believe i'm overhyping them, it's just not true Lebron was alone against the world."
"Jordan Clarkson was ridiculous that game don’t get me wrong, but if you’re saying Ben was guarding him you simply didn’t watch the game  He guarded Mitchell who had 24 points on 24 shots, just like he did in the second game where he had 33 points on 34 shots  Why does everyone gotta force stats to fit their narrative lol"
I'm tryna see Jalen Green and Jordan Clarkson play together on the Philippines national team 👀🤤
"Neither this Clippers roster nor that Cavs roster was 'dog shit'. They have depth but not much shooting. How is it dog shit when you have Rondo and Beverly as your 7th and 8th men off the bench. Cavs had two star players and a lot of very good role players and shooters. Korver, Jordan Clarkson, Hood, Tristan thompson, Nance Jr. Thats a lot better than most teams 6-10 rotation."
Jordan Clarkson
As jordan clarkson would say
Does noone in this thread realise that Jordan Clarkson already won 6moty lol
"A lot of the ones using On/Off data get sort of skewed because Mike is replaced by Jordan Clarkson a lot of the time, and at the same time Gobert takes a seat.  The on/off data sees the defensive dropoff from losing Gobert and  Clarkson entering and assigns too much of it to Conley."
I think Jordan Clarkson is a good comparison for potential. Herro is a pretty solid defender though
"How about the 2018 Cavs?  &gt; Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  &gt; Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  &gt; As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)  \- Dwayne Wade     \- Channing Frye     \- Isaiah Thomas     \- Jae Crowder     \- Derrick Rose     \- Iman Shmpert     \- Dimitrios Agravanis       \+ Jordan Clarkson     \+ Larry Nance Jr.     \+ George Hill     \+ Rodney Hood     \+ Artūras Gudaitis      It was a weird season."
"Jordan Clarkson &amp; Jordan Poole were both quite bad previous to this season, and really took off in my eyes.  Poole's ascent is more exciting because he's only in year 2.  Clarkson's is more shocking because he was bad for 6 years!"
I love hearing players like Jordan talk about how grateful he is to be in a situation and a franchise that tries to bring out the best in him. Just let him be him and work on getting him to be the best version of that. Hope more players like Clarkson find their way to the Jazz.
"Jordan Clarkson, offensive rebounder"
"Jordan Clarkson with the worm in the air, very normal and very cool"
I'm as surprised as Jordan Clarkson looks.
I think you mean Jordan clarkson
1. Steph Curry ......... 47.2%   2. Zach LaVine ........ 36.9   3. Jamal Murray .......36.9   4. James Harden ..... 36.8   5. Dame Lillard .........36.0   6. Luka Doncic ......... 35.7   7. Jayson Tatum ....... 34.6   8. Jordan Clarkson ... 33.3
That's like saying both KD and Jordan Clarkson are score first players. They are not at the same level in terms of talent
"Even in a bench player lineup, Jordan Clarkson needs to come off the bench. He’s pretty purely a microwave scorer and thrives most off the bench. You’re better off starting Jalen Brunson or Josh Richardson and removing Herro from the team.  Can’t think of someone right now I feel but there’s better guys to have than Melo"
"Yeah, fuck them... they’re not incredibly fun to watch or anything... *secretly watches Jordan Clarkson highlights*.  I would absolutely love to cheer for the Grizzlies against the Mavs, though. I love when young teams with something to prove to up against heavy hitters. The games are always so fun."
"Jordan Clarkson, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram"
And this year's not playing for Luke Walton award goes to... Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson!  Lonzo Ball is winning MIP next year confirmed.
"Jordan Clarkson is clearly not the best 6th man in the league. If [any superstar] only came off the bench instead of having to carry games from the starting position, he would easily be the best 6th man."
"I don’t the Lakers make moves for a single ring, and D Lo, Jordan Clarkson, and Julius Randle weren’t traded for Davis, so what the fuck are you talking about.   Stop it 5"
"Larry Nance, Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso, Jordan Clarkson, Zubac, Josh Hart, THT"
Lmao he's literally wearing a Jordan Clarkson shirt
"I couldn't even make it all the way through the clip of him with Jordan Clarkson after winning 6th man award. He straight up said nothing that wasn't painstakingly obvious, while attempting to sound dramatic and insightful."
"Jazz have a few undrafted legends on their squad in Royce Oneal and Joe Ingles. Sixth man of the year Jordan Clarkson was also a second round pick. Of those 3 only Royce was originally signed/drafted by the Jazz. Bojan Bogdanovic was also the first pick of the second round, also not drafted by Utah."
"idk who Jordan Clarkson is either, my man. Bum status.     Bobby Portis: - ONLY NBA non-starter to avg at least 10p &amp; 7r   \- 52.3% FG ranks 25th (none of 3 finalists are top 45)   \- 47.1% 3pt FG ranks 3rd (better than 3 finalists, all guards)   \- 12 dbl-dbls (3 finalists w/3 combined)"
I saw the potential in Jordan Clarkson when he played for the Cavs. I am so upset they let him go. What a huge loss for the team.
I'm not sure D. Wade was being sarcastic at all when he said he should've been more like Jordan Clarkson.
"Yes, but the 2nd half of Clarkson's season was extremely pedestrian and full of   ""It's Jordan Clarkson time""  - Jordan Clarkson"
"I mean sure, I just don't like how Jordan Clarkson needs to play on those so he could be called a real Filipino baller"
Would you rather have Clarkson or Jordan Poole going forward? Serious question. Basically been the same player since post-ASB except Poole is more efficient and better TO% on slightly less volume
I believe that Herro has potential but it was 100% blown out of proportion. I don't think he'll reach Devin Booker status but I think something like a better version of Jordan Clarkson is perfectly achievable for him
"He's already a serviceable microwave scorer on league average efficiency, and above average TS% with low TO% post all star break. Actually he's basically been Jordan Clarkson post-all star break with slightly lower usage and minutes. He's in the hybrid Barbosa / Livingston role as backup PG &amp; instant offense, and actually slots very nicely into all of Curry's sets. He's also a decent PnR ball handler who makes legit good decisions so he has more upside to tap. I think next year Kerr will craft a 2nd unit offense around Poole / Wiseman / Klay / Wiggins that's more PnR heavy to maximize everyone's talents."
Utah's Jordan Clarkson has been named NBA ~~Sixth Man~~ Best Bench Scorer of the Year
"No they didn't 😂. D'Angelo Russell sucked in LA, Jordan Clarkson got traded for scraps and Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram did NOT live up to expectations."
"No because the Lakers are an incompetent organization that can't develop jack shit. Literally the second D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle left they became all-stars. Jordan Clarkson became the 6th man of the year, Lonzo Ball became a good point gaurd and even guys like Ivica Zubac are thriving."
"lol Jordan Clarkson isn't even the best bench player on his team... ""here's an award for best bench player in the league!""   It's not bad though, it's fine. It's not like those awful Jamal Crawford selections for 6th man.   Dirk averaged 7/3/0.7 in his last season and was named an All-Star, so I mean this award looks fine for Clarkson haha"
"&gt;Ok. So how is thinking that Clarkson isn’t DPOY “casual”?  Still something I ain't say. You know there's a quote feature on reddit right?   I said people who *just* use advanced stats think he doesn't at least deserve it. People who just use only one method to make an analysis, specifically against Jordan Clarkson.   &gt;I know we at least agree that you are just going by ppg and don’t want people to think anything through, though I’m not sure if you’ll admit it.  I'll let you in on a secret. I know you can read. But addressing your sad attempts at insults and strawman takes too long so I won't do it beyond here."
So cute how Ingles is wearing a Jordan Clarkson tshirt.
"""oh frick!""  - Jordan Clarkson, 5/24/2021"
"You should show the whole setup.   For those who didn't see it, the crew asked Ingles and Clarkson a series of 3 questions about 6th man history. The last question was ""How many Jazz players have won the 6th man award?""  Jordan hesitantly says ""Zero"" and Ingles says ""One"".  Ernie asks Joe, ""Okay, who's the one?""  Joe says, ""Jordan Clarkson"" and passes him the trophy."
Jordan Clarkson reminds me of GaTa from the show Dave
Wearing the Jordan Clarkson flamethrower shirt too
Congrats to Jordan Clarkson for real
"Jordan Clarkson and Joe Ingles actually both do some similar stuff, but in the half court"
"Jordan Clarkson, although he is kind of a perfect 6th man because of his offense off the bench. Kinda like Lou Will"
Ridiculously inefficient is a terrible take.  He didn't do his Jordan Clarkson thing of lighting up the second team but he was fine.   Shot badly from 3 but got to the basket enough to make up for it.
No that was just Jordan Clarkson taking another 3
"&gt; one of our best players (Clarkson) having the worst game of his career  Maybe given how important the game was sure, but if you think it's the worst game of Jordan Clarkson's career you didn't watch him enough in Cleveland."
"Doesn't Jordan Clarkson suck in the playoffs? I remember him shitting the bed with Cleveland, and he was ridiculously inefficient last year as well. Him underperforming isn't surprising in the slightest."
"Living in Southern California, there's just a big mix of legit Lakers fans who know what they're talking about and another giant population of Lakers fans who are obnoxious bandwagoners.  I saw a *lot* of people with Warriors merch popping up around the area during peak Curry/Thompson/Green/KD era and way fewer Lakers jerseys than usual. But the moment LeBron signed, it was like a sea of purple and gold overnight. I can't blame everyone for that, but so many act as if they stayed Lakers fans the whole time. Then you ask them who Brandon Ingram or Julius Randle or Jordan Clarkson or Timofey Mozgov were and they're clueless lol  I guess you can't knock them for wanting to represent, and at least there's real fans of the team who actually did keep with the team when they struggled. But it's a headache sometimes"
"Oh hey Jordan Clarkson, are you talking about your game tonight?"
"Jordan Clarkson dropped the ball big time. I don’t care what Donovan Mitchell’s condition is, having him stand in the corner 3pt and cherry pick while the Jazz play 4 on 5 would’ve been a more effective use of Jordan Clarkson’s minutes than whatever the hell was going on tonight."
"If Jordan Clarkson is your main scorer in the postseason, you're gonna have a bad time"
  Somebody tell Jordan Clarkson he's not playing for us anymore.
Jordan clarkson is part of the fake nice group
"Jordan Clarkson taking a fadeaway pull-up 3 would've been a higher IQ shot, lord he's been so bad tonight."
22% from 3 holy hell. 8 on 36 attempts. Jordan clarkson with hot trash numbers.
Jordan Clarkson 0-8 from 3pt with 4 turnovers... Not much else to say. When do the Jazz recover Mitchell?
Jordan “We’ve got a fucking squad now” Clarkson has made an appearance in this game.  This is the darkest timeline for the Jazz.
way too much Jordan Clarkson tonight
"If Jordan Clarkson was the best player on a bad team, he’d average 45 points on 60 shots a night"
Jordan Clarkson gonna win series MVP for us if he keeps this up
"Just what everyone expected, a Dillon Brooks and Jordan Clarkson duel to decide game 1."
I feel like Utah is in need of a crafty PG like rondo or McConnell to lead the second unit or to make better ball movement. Jordan Clarkson carrying the ball for the whole 24 seconds might work for regular season but not playoff playing against Memphis with versatile defenders like Dillion brooks and Kyle Anderson. They are good at intercepting the balls
yo jordan clarkson is drunk as fuck
This feels like a big Jordan Clarkson third quarter game.
Got a feeling Jordan Clarkson is gonna light it up tonight.
"Alex Len is pretty good. He does most things passably. He can hang. He just doesn’t make the big play. Gafford makes the big play, but he doesn’t consistently do the things required by starting centers. Look back at his time in Chicago. It’s the same way that guys like Jordan Clarkson or even at times KCP have been great, elite 6th men that you don’t wanna start because they’re not going to properly run your offense. It’s the big man version of that."
Jordan Clarkson 🔥🔥🔥
"Ant needs to get some pointers from Norman on slashing into the paint with confidence. Once he can do that regularly, and the defender has to back up a bit to respect his first step, but then cannot challenge his quick release, Ant would be literally unguardable. He could continue to suck at defense for the rest of his life and he still would be guaranteed at least 6th man money for the next 10 years a la Jordan Clarkson or Lou Williams."
"Uhhhh no lol, I would expect the same article if it was like, Jordan Clarkson. It wouldn’t get as much attention, but that’s not the journalist’s fault. Also it IS bigger news when it’s a league superstar, FOH"
"They drafted julius Randle, dlo Russell, brandon Ingram. All three have been all stars. Plus Jordan Clarkson who is going to win 6th man of the year. Why are we acting like their rebuild/tanking was unsuccessful?? Obv lebron and ad won them a chip but they were set up for the future"
"Speaking of Ben McLemore, what is Lebron's infatuation with teammates who are streaky shooters and wild as hell like Jr, Shump, KCP, McLemore, Lance Stephenson, Jordan Clarkson, Dion Waiters, etc. Man always picks the strangest dudes as his personal ""shooters"""
"Cedi Osman, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood"
I feel like Jazz were able to rally around Mitchels injury and still finish #1 but wouldn’t be surprised if they got bounced out of the first round. I don’t think Jordan Clarkson will do well in the playoffs. High scoring sixth men always struggle in the playoffs.
"Allen is actually having a decent career arc so far, way better than most ppl including myself probably thought. He’s not Jordan Clarkson level production off the bench but is a decent role player for sure right now.  Important guy for the Grizz’s second unit, pulling 10 PPG, on 40% 3P shooting and 25 min off the bench this year."
Jordan Poole reminds me of a bootleg Jordan Clarkson
GSW had a hard time beating the Jordan Clarkson Jazz. I don't think either team has a chance beating them at their full strength.
Jingles or Jordan Clarkson
"basically Jordan Clarkson, but bigger, faster, WAYYYY better defense and passing"
"Well theres some logic to that.  A ) California has the largest Filipino population in the US , B ) Jordan Clarkson was drafted by them and C ) with the time difference it makes more sense to follow a west coast team than a east coast team"
It is. Wat Misaka was his name. Unless you count Kyle Anderson who's 1/8th Chinese or Jordan Clarkson who's half Filipino.
Jordan Clarkson be hooping D Rose prolly get it based off sympathy that’s my guy but Clarkson deserve it no 🧢
I love Rose.. but Jordan Clarkson will win the 6th man Award this year without even a competition. That man been on another level coming off the bench. Somehow HE became one of the key reasons the Jazz been so crazy good this regular season.  &gt;  Clarkson just doesn't do anything but getting mad buckets as the 6th man.. Like a taller Lou Williams
"Honestly dude the trainer should’ve never brought this up. It honestly sounds like a cry for help from Kobe to his trainer, because this is not some shit we’ve heard from anyone else not Shaq, not Rob Pelinka, not even Jordan Clarkson. This sounds like some mental disturbances if he’s doing it at other people’s inconvenience"
Jordan clarkson is actually a combination of the two
It does take a while for players to fit into Snyder's system. He doesn't really let players freelance unless if it's Jordan Clarkson.
"Rooting for Michael Jordan Clarkson to win this one, don't even have anything against Rose and Jingles.   &amp;nbsp;  ^(There could be bias too)"
Jordan Clarkson is the modern day version playing with Kobe &amp; Lebron
Jordan Clarkson
Schroder is in Jordan Clarkson mode. Just not passing the ball.
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
"Jordan Clarkson is the 6MOTY and it shouldn't even be close. Even if you include Joe's great numbers as a starter, JC still had the better season. Played better than Joe in around \~70% of the games.  It's a shame you guys look at analytics too much and don't watch the games."
No celebrity makes me feel like an out of touch old man as Jordan Clarkson. He's like peak late millennial/early gen z hippness.
"Yeah I don’t wanna say it in our sub, but I think Sexton isn’t in our long term future unless he takes a 6th man role.      Especially after we let Okoro run offensive sets later in the year. And EXTRA especially if we end up with one of the guards in the Draft.      Sexton kinda becomes Jordan Clarkson at times: if he touches the ball the other 4 guys stop because he’s likely shooting… and there have been anonymous quotes saying this pisses the other players off."
Did Jordan Clarkson just become my top 10 fav player in the league? Jazz players seem so likable and genuine
All the Kevin Nguyens and Stephen Li's and Andrew Kim's are all gonna see Jalen Green and Jordan Clarkson and finally feel represented at the professional basketball level that somebody who looks like them was able to make it. A monumental moment for the system to finally see Asian folks as athletic and capable.. this is truly what representation is about..
Jordan Clarkson
"The worst team Luke Walton coached had DLo, Ingram, Randle, Lou Will, Jordan Clarkson, and Larry Nance. He took a team with that talent level to 26-56. Luke has been making his players actively worse for years"
"As compared to the dynamite second-best scorers on teams like the Hawks, Suns, and Jazz?   Powell put up 20ppg on 60%TS his last year.  Jazz second-leading scorer was Jordan Clarkson on 55% TS.  Second-best scorer on the Suns was CP3 putting up 16 on 60% TS.  For Atlanta it was Collins putting up 18ppg.  And Dame is the best scorer on any of those teams(not to mention he's a top 5 offense by himself basically).    So I would say you're incorrect."
I didn't even see the thread in the rockets sub when you asked this but jesus christ the first two people that came to mind were hardaway jr and jordan clarkson
add jordan clarkson for utah jazz
"Dallas overachieved, they up 2-0 because of some godly shooting. Jazz just mentally weak and no adjustment. Their best player is jordan clarkson with gobert exposed and mitchell limping"
"In terms of decision making and controlling the pace, yeah. Being a microwave scorer isn't a knock on him, but he's more of Lou Will/Jordan Clarkson type than say a CJ McCollum (without the stupid foot), who can make sound decisions even if he's not hitting shots. I feel he contributes his best value as a high burst scoring 6th man. Stats really are half of the story in players like him, he's really really good at getting the energy up with scoring, but he doesn't have a size advantage against anyone, doesn't really know how to play with pace too well, so putting him in the starting lineup is not good, especially in a playoff setting."
"Potential 6th man of the year. Jamal Crawford, Jordan Clarkson type of player."
"Think Jamal Crawford, jordan clarkson,  etc. Whether you think that’s a compliment in today’s game is up to you. Some will say ‘well clarkson was just 6th man of the year for a 1 seed’. Yea well their roster is not ideal they don’t have a real 2nd option. And you also saw they lost   Personally I’m not a fan of the designated 6th man who has the green light to come in and heist. It’s kinda outdated. I’d rather my 6th man be a mismatch problem (ie Gallinari) or someone who can score without that ball (Ingles), or instant offense from the low post, ie Montrez Harrell, who shoots 60% whereas someone like Dinwiddie is gonna shoot low 40s"
From what one Nets fan told me he's Jordan Clarkson with better playmaking. That can be valuable.
Or like Kobe telling Jordan Clarkson to stop going to the rim like a light-skin dude lol
"Chandler Parsons, Jordan Clarkson, Blake, Kuzma, Simmons, Booker  Booker’s the most complete player on her roster to date, she could be a better gm than what most teams have with her scouting ability"
Reminds me of when Kobe told Jordan Clarkson to stop playing like a light skin dude and this sub thought light skin meant white lol
Maxes +cj should be the starting lineup. Seth plays Jordan clarkson role.
could be the jordan clarkson for an entire nation
"I’m reading what you’re saying. He ranked second in USG% in the regular season with a TOV% of 12.2. That TOV% is in line with the players surrounding him, so at first glance it seems like he’s not that turnover prone.   However, his AST% is a mediocre 16.2 which is vastly inferior to everyone else around him. The other guys who are comparable (just skimming) are Zion Williamson, Jordan Clarkson, and Jerami Grant, and they all have slightly lower TOV%.   I mean, it goes without saying that if a player’s role is to create assists he’s going to wind up with more turnovers because he’s handling and passing the ball more frequently. So when Embiid has a similar TOV% and has the second highest USG% in the league, but he’s not being a facilitator or passing, then he’s turning it over when he shouldn’t.   You can use USG%, TOV%, and AST%, or AST/TO ratio; whichever way you slice it he’s turning the ball over at the same rate as players who *are* making risky passes to create open looks, but he’s doing so while handling the ball in isolation.   You said it yourself; it’s been a problem since his rookie year, the media asks him about it every summer, and despite some minor improvements it’s still holding him back. We don’t even need to bring stats into it to know that, but I like to because they are reference points that tell me *to what degree* of a problem it is. And based on the stats it’s a pretty major problem. It’s probably second to his durability in flaws in his player profile. Good thing he’s elite at pretty much everything else he’s asked to do."
Ex: Jordan Clarkson before this season. If he caught it you might as well get ready to play defense cuz you’re not getting it back.
He's very comparable to Jordan clarkson on a cheaper contract. So he's actually pretty important.
Kyrie healthy multiple games. Ask Lebron if he wants harden on one leg or Jordan Clarkson
Kobe would've told Simmons to stop going to the [hole like a light skin dude](https://www.complex.com/sports/2016/01/jordan-clarkson-kobe-bryant-told-stop-taking-ball-to-basket-like-light-skin-dark-skin-dude).
"Ooh nice. Now Kyrie Irving and James Harden to Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance, wonder where Lebron would be if you gave them those for a few games even if they didn’t play the entire series"
Jordan Clarkson was the anomaly
Jordan Clarkson
showing solidarity for jordan clarkson
We just gonna pretend like Jordan Clarkson ain't out here thriving?
"yeah dinwiddie is arguably a better player than most of them, but he doesn't help address our biggest need, which is a good 4.  imo nowell could become a jordan clarkson-type player with okay d and passing, jmac is never gonna be more than a back-up pg but he's solid"
Jordan Clarkson has waved off LeBron. He's not a passer at.
"Khris, FVV &amp; Jordan Clarkson are great answers"
"I think OP clearly is asking who’s in their peak prime years, not who is still priming but may have dropped off 1%/5% whatever. Middleton, AD, Kyrie, Beal I think are pretty much in their absolute peak, also Fred VanVleet, Jordan Clarkson. Pretty much guys around 1991-1995ish. Kawhi/KD/PG are clearly priming, but lost at least 1% from their peaks. Giannis/Luka are also priming but still trending up."
I was surprised when Jordan Clarkson turned out to be good. Just assumed it was the laker effect.
Jordan Clarkson would never.
"Was actually referring to Kyle Korver and Jordan Clarkson (yes Lebron played with them in the Cavs), so thanks for adding a couple of talents to Lebron’s list. KD’s Steph and Harden to Lebron’s Wade and AD then"
Jordan Clarkson too
Thank you for the fantastic defense Jordan Clarkson
"Funny thing is a lot of guys from that shit squad have had career resurgences since then. Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, even Larry Nance are all at least above average rotation players now"
"It's crazy to me how people compare this to LeBron 2018. KD has a former MVP, 2 great scorers (Green and Griffin) and one of the best 3pt shooters in the league. LeBron had disabled Kevin Love and Jordan Clarkson (who sucked back then). He also took that team to the Finals and set playoff records. As always Bron &gt; KD and it's not close."
"Bucks really need that Jordan Clarkson, Lou Will (Shake Milton? Lol) type who can come off the bench, take the pressure off the stars a bit and just score"
why does Jordan Clarkson average more points than most of the Jazz players then?
"Yep. Same with the Mavs in games 1 and 2.  The Clippers actually faced some absolutely wild 3 point shot making from both teams, but they largely had better execution over both opponents starting somewhere in Game 2.  Like, Jordan Clarkson went on a 17-2 run on some fucking WILD shots.  When the Jazz made like 17 3s in a half and were only up by 5, that was bad news for them."
"no, when awful defenders like jordan clarkson or donovan mitchell are beat off of the dribble by guys like paul george, they are not going to recover and force an inefficient result. they require help defense. very simple.   your lack of understanding of basic basketball defense is ridiculous lol  and no one followed you into a different thread"
Lmao exactly. Keeps saying contested as if anyone is scared to hear Jordan Clarkson footsteps behind them
Tbf Donovan Mitchell and Jordan clarkson have already lived up to what they’re payed.    Gobert didn’t. He has to handle all the media and do the teams laundry at this point considering his play and contract.
"In an elimination game, eh, I would disagree with that. Jordan Clarkson had a good game in the second half. I thought it was somewhat of a mistake to sit him in crucial stretches of the third. There's some adjustments that could be made. No coach is perfect and yeah, fans overreact to a lot of stuff, but I don't think giving the best 3p shooting team in the nba shorter corner 3's for the second half should just be ignored."
Jordan Clarkson
They lose by 20+ instead of 10  Nothing is changing with how laughable their perimeter defense was with who you put at the 5. One legged Donovan Mitchell was a disaster on defense total barbecue chicken Jordan Clarkson and others sure didn’t help either. Team wide defensive disaster
IMO Jordan clarkson is an empty stats kind of guy even though he won 6MOY I would’ve given it to ingles
“it’s jordan clarkson time”  - jordan clarkson
"Some jazz fan gave me crap for bringing this up a few months ago. I was adamant that there's no way a team where the second leading scorer was Jordan Clarkson was going to win an NBA championship. I just don't see it and still don't. The team clearly needs a legit number two behind Donovan, who I think has clearly shown can carry a team as a number one."
"We had both ingles and Clarkson play heavy minutes and both dropped 0 in the second. It’s not like they were contributing a lot either. Besides the clippers are still better equipped to handle that sort of offense with the fact that they have great perimeter defenders that the Jazz don’t have. There were absolutely no adjustments to be made. The only adjustment that could be made would be to sign an athletic 3 and d player at halftime. Putting ingles and clarkson in without Gobert would not only make us unable to get a rebound if pg or Reggie Jordan actually missed a shot for once in a blue moon, but render our improvement on offense absolutely useless as we would probably be even worse on defense with any wing at the five and ingles clarkson Mitchell and Conley . Omg we might actually give up over 200 points if that happened"
"He needs a fucking co star the next best players on his team can’t be a baguette biyombo, Jordan clarkson (at best a like fourth option but I love him, keep him) and a mid 30s Croatian dude"
"The only reasonable attempt would be taking him out, moving Royce or Bogi to the 5 and putting in Jordan Clarkson or Ingles."
The Jordan Clarkson experience
" I agree, the only player that comes to mind is Royce O Neal, but he lacks the confidence (not skill) to drive and shoot frequently. I agree on the character part - players like Jordan Clarkson are not going to win you a championship, much like every other 6moty (besides Manu, of course). However, given the resources, I would say that this season would be on par with previous seasons in terms of expectations, and I can't wait to see what Dennis Lindsey plans next."
"Big market Utah, loved by the media, especially Rudy Gobert and Jordan Clarkson."
Lost in all of this is exactly how thermonuclear Jordan Clarkson was in the 2nd quarter.
Replace him with who? Niang? Or the excellent defender Jordan Clarkson?
Jordan Clarkson quote gonna be posted several times.
Jordan clarkson having zero points in the second half is so JC lmao
Yo so did they just stop giving it to Jordan Clarkson in the 2nd half or what?
Jordan Clarkson was good for like 5 minutes
"Royce O’Neale and Jordan Clarkson were acting brave in the first half, and now… crickets."
So what’s the reason Jordan Clarkson rarely plays in the second half??
The Jordan Clarkson rollercoaster experience
jordan clarkson went super hot and mann took his heat
Jordan clarkson is a perfect example of being a good player but not elite to finish games off
"Jordan ""Jesus Christ"" Clarkson scored 21 points in the 2nd. he scored 17 straight by himself, causing Jazz to go up by 25. Terrence ""Kawhi Leonard"" Mann can't miss and has a career high, bringing the Clippers back into it."
"Close game in the first. Jordan Clarkson fuckin exploded in the second quarter and scored 17 straight, 21 in the quarter to give the Jazz a 22 point lead. Then Terrence Mann went insane in the third to bring it back to a 6 point game"
Just like we all expected... Jordan Clarkson versus Terrence Mann
"Terrance Mann vs Jordan Clarkson, the superstar showdown everyone expected this series."
Here comes Michael Jordan Clarkson Jesus Christ
1. Jordan Clarkson 2. Royce O’Neal 3. French Bismack Biyombo
Heat check Jordan Clarkson
jordan clarkson went absolutely nuclear
Let it just be a Terence Mann v Jordan Clarkson duel for the rest of the game
[non AMP](https://cavsnation.com/cavs-news-jordan-clarkson-having-the-worst-postseason-ever-according-to-one-metric/)
"Terrance ""Jordan Clarkson"" Mann"
Jordan Clarkson the greatest player of all time
Jordan Clarkson had seventeen straight points
"Donovan Mitchell and Jordan Clarkson of the Utah Jazz have been on fire! If they keep scoring more than the Clippers, the Jazz will win the game."
Jordan Clarkson has come a long way since his Lakers days.
"that half time analysis was literally just ""Donovan Mitchell and Jordan Clarkson are good at basketball"" smh"
Michael Jordan Clarkson
Is it a coincidence that Jordan Clarkson and Jesus Christ share the same initials? I don't think so.
Jordan Clarkson  Jordan Clarkson  Jordan Clarkson  Jordan Clarkson  Jordan Clarkson  Jordan Clarkson  Jordan Clarkson  Jordan Clarkson  Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Michael Clarkson is that you?
"Was 43-40 at that point. Those 3fts for Jordan ""josh smith"" Clarkson going."
Seriously wtf is that Jordan Michael Clarkson?
I wish people would say his whole name when referring to him like his parents intended... Michael Jordan Clarkson!
"Middle of the 2nd  Clippers: We got this guys  Jordan Clarkson: Yippee Ki Yay, motherfucker."
tear down the stockton statue and put up our lord and saviour JORDAN CLARKSON in its place
Who’s the cutest player on the Jazz? Has to be tied between Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson right?
Is Jordan Clarkson the secret real best player on the jazz
man jordan clarkson completely changed this game
Jordan Clarkson got bit by whatever but Mitchell in the first quarter.
**Jordan Clarkson Filipino deity of  love  and vengeance**
Or that Jordan Clarkson is pronounced Micheal Jordan
Not much you can do to adjust against Jordan “Jesus Christ” Clarkson
https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/clarkjo01.html  Jordan Clarkson is a basketball player fot the Utah Jazz
"Jordan ""Michael Jordan"" Clarkson"
"Jordan "",Michael"" Clarkson"
clippers fans relieved to have proof that jordan clarkson can actually miss because until that shot you could probably say he was incapable of missing and people would believe you
Michael Jordan Clarkson going off
I watched all nuggets Playoff games since last year since we didn't make it. He completely changed the series for the nuggets. He locked down Jordan Clarkson bumass and locked Mitchell a few possessions. Got the game winning steal too.  He also defended pg really well despite being 4 inches shorter.   I wish the warriors would get him if he could shoot again
"Somebody askewd for my reasons, so here it is:   &amp;#x200B;  1. Derrick Rose - His pure love and respect of the game is just visible.  2. Chris Paul - It's the only thing that's missing in his HOF career.   3. Seth Curry - He's worked hard and made his own path. Same the Gasols for me.  4. Joe Ingles - He's quite a character, foreign impact, a sportsman.  5. Jordan Clarkson - He's an inspiration to aspiring Filipinos (A little bias cause I am), and him embracing the second squad roles is something young guys can learn from."
i think we can all agree that sga and jordan clarkson are the best dressed in the league
Jordan clarkson only needs 2mm
jordan clarkson revenge season for 2018? stay tuned
Wade on saying he'd want to be Jordan Clarkson too if he came back to the NBA:  https://youtu.be/NQR5JNxzit0
"Jordan Clarkson hit a gnarly one like that last night, too. https://youtu.be/qAvlLTsoIqg"
"Hot take, but I actually care zero about Lakers championship last year. Not because of covid, but because it was Lebron and AD and a bunch of ring chasers. I can hardly bring myself to watch now tbh.  I enjoyed watching the games way more when we had a trash team with a bunch of young guys like Dlo, Randle, BI, Jordan Clarkson, Zubac, etc. It's fun to watch guys grow as a team and win. It's not that fun to watch guys who have been in the league 12 years join teams and win. I think that's part of why Caruso is so big with our fan base (besides the memeability of his appearance). One of the few guys left that was developed by the team."
Basically a shorter Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan clarkson
"I'm really happy for Jordan Clarkson this season.  I think he was pretty polarizing when he was on the Cavs, but I always like him. His first playoff experience in 2018 was objectively bad, glad he's now well past those jitters and found a way to be an effective bucket-getter in the postseason."
Jordan Clarkson.   Norm turned into booty boy in Portland.
Jordan Clarkson has the greenest of lights. What a fun job he has. Get in the game and shoot.
If you showed an NBA fan in 2005 this game they would think Jordan Clarkson was the next MJ. The level of difficult shot taking and making in todays era is absurd.
I looked at the box score and my first thought was “Jordan Clarkson was the only sub Utah made?”
Jordan Clarkson is the ultimate 6MOTY
"Reggie Jackson needs to have the exact same role as Jordan Clarkson. If he does, he’ll be successful. But as a starter he’s just an undersized shooting guard, doesn’t work well there. He seems to have ego and want to start, he can do it but then he needs to go play next to Luka/Harden/Embiid/Joker types. Maybe Giannis or LaMelo too."
"100% ""It's Jordan Clarkson time !""  - Jordan Clarkson"
Jordan Clarkson reps the Philippines hard though
I friccin love Jordan Clarkson.
'Jordan Clarkson gets buckets' is a hill that I will die on 100% of the time
We can’t beat the Suns with Mitchell Boogy and Conley with health issues. Even Jordan Clarkson had a knee issue late in the forth.
It’s Jordan Clarkson
JC = Jordan Clarkson not the other guy
Mitchell has no business averaging 40ppg vs the clippers. Morris and beverley forgot how to play basketball but its not an excuse to make mitchell and especially jordan clarkson look like MJ out there
“It’s Jordan Clarkson time” - Scott Foster
Jordan Clarkson is the best player in the world when he gets hot
"Just woke up from a coma, are Reggie Jackson and Jordan Clarkson the best players in the nba?"
Jordan Clarkson hates passing
"Yeah, exactly that.  The green ranger shows up after the main 5 rangers need help and then the green ranger gives the team that boost they need for the win.  That's Jordan Clarkson.  The Green Ranger for the Jazz"
"Clarkson going off, love it.  Crazy to think of the Laker's 07 Roster. (I know they got AD for some of these pieces but still)  Lonzo Ball: Max potentially incoming Alex Caruso Josh Hart Brandom Ingram: Max Contract Larry Nance Julius Randle: MIP Jordan Clarkson: 6MOY"
"Jordan Clarkson is the 6th ranger for the Utah Jazz.  The sixth ranger on power ranger teams does not always show up at the start of fights (like the starting 5) and gets less screen time than the main 5 rangers (the starting 5) but when the sixth ranger shows, it wrecks stuff and just does cool things."
JORDAN CLARKSON
Look i dont even know how the game is going to end but i feel like Jordan Clarkson should be given a W regardless of what it looks like
Jordan Clarkson and Jesus Christ have the same initials. Just saying.
"Hello, do you have a moment to discuss our Lord and Savior, Jordan Clarkson?"
I am so happy for Jordan Clarkson and this Utah crowd is no fucking joke.   &amp;#x200B;  FUCK IT!!! JAZZ BANDWAGON LEGGO!!!!!!
Jordan Clarkson is better than your Michael Jordan

"""*Good defense. I'll make it anyway.*"" - Jordan Clarkson"
He plays like it the majority of the regular season...  But every half decent player seems to outshine him in the playoffs. He gets challenged and out played by supposedly lesser players all the time (tonight Jordan Clarkson)  Last year he got outplayed by Morris and again this year it’d seem that Morris is better at creating his own shot.    It’s weird.  He has all the skills. The handle the pass the shooting the defense.    He can just never string it together.
Jordan Clarkson damn
"Clippers will come back 100%, jordan clarkson is gonna shoot Utah out of it in the second half"
So happy for Jordan Clarkson
"Jordan Clarkson, Joe Harris, Lonzo and on the other end, Kuzma   Edit : And Randle"

"""*This is why I was the 6^th Man of the Year.*"" - Jordan Clarkson"
Jordan Clarkson is the best Jordan to ever play a playoff game in Utah.
I don’t really give a fuck about PG13 - I live in Philly and am not a Clipper fan   I have another player here to worry about   I’m just a neutral fan of bball calling it like I see it.... right now I’d take Jordan Clarkson on my team over PG13 and that’s just sad   You’re the one who replied to my initial comment so I guess it got you reaching into your feelings
"Honestly, Jordan Clarkson is low-key the most fun player to watch"
I’m glad Jordan Clarkson found a home in Utah.
"Jordan clarkson does not fuck with passing, and honestly, I respect that."
every time he plays houston he turns into michael jordan clarkson tell me about it
Jordan Clarkson out there looking like an elf from Witcher 3.
Jordan Clarkson is so much fun to watch because he’s the type of dude who will jack up like 10 shots in 5 minutes and either go 8/10 or 1/10
Man every time i watch Jordan Clarkson play i'm like Jordan Clarkson can't be this good wtf. who is that. oh i guess it really is jordan clarkson  My head just refuses to adjust its calibration for him lmao
Jordan Clarkson is such an entertaining player to watch
I love Jordan Clarkson
Who does he think he is? Jordan Clarkson?
"what disingenuous phrasing. jordan clarkson is the 6th man of the year and a great iso scorer, and the shot he hit was contested and not at all easy. y’all are just hating to hate"
#Jordan Clarkson for 6MOTY &amp; MIP
"If Luka had Jordan Clarkson instead of KP, Mavs sweep"
Even Jordan Clarkson that used to get clowned on with the Lakers and got traded to the Cavs (Siberia) is now clowning PG13 on offense 😂
Jordan “Instant Grits” Clarkson!!
Jordan Clarkson has the ultimate green light off the bench!
jordan clarkson most handsome player on both teams
tonight will be the jordan clarkson game. he’s going for 45
"I know he struggled and it sucked. But his terrible season was 19.3/4/5 on 42/36. He was still better than guys like Jordan Clarkson, it’s just Kemba makes 10-15ish million more than he should for how many games he missed.  Edit: deleted dupes, lemme know if I had extra copies. (Internet being garbage)"
"Oh, you mean the game the Jazz won and was never really close to in doubt in the 2nd half?  Jordan Clarkson scored 40 against the 76ers in the same game, why didn't Simmons shut him down? After all Simmons can guard every position."
Jordan Clarkson rn. I lived in the Philippines for a couple years and there were two names they always knew when it came to basketball. LeBron and Clarkson. Having on my team now is awesome and especially when he plays so well.
"jae crowder always cryin with somebody , tired of him  but I want jazz to win it all for jordan clarkson!"
"Because he was guarding Donovan Mitchell. In your infinite wisdom would you rather have your best defender on Jordan Clarkson or Donovan Mitchell? ....Yea I thought so.  Btw Mitchell finished the night 9-24, 2-8 from 3 and 24 points in 35 minutes of play. Those numbers are below his average on the season. 🤷‍♂️"
"Jordan ""6th man"" Clarkson dropped 40 on Simmons the same night"
False. Jordan Clarkson was primarily Danny Green's responsibility. https://youtu.be/gQU_FWZRNSo
Jordan Clarkson is half Asian so its nice seeing him being represented in the NBA in a big stage. Be nice if we got more Asian NBA players.
Remember Jordan Clarkson is half Filipino.
"6 man of the year is whoever scores the most off the bench in the first 2 months of the season, people had already decided Jordan Clarkson was winning in february"
when jordan clarkson dropped 40 on him this season
"Filipino legend, Jordan Clarkson"
Thank you Jordan Clarkson. We need more people in the NBA promoting #StopAsianHate.
Are the Lakers getting tattoos Jordan Clarkson or not ?
no ty corbin means no dante exum and therefore no jordan clarkson but i know what you mean.
Thank you Jordan Clarkson for bringing awareness to the larger community of this despicable act. Fuck Asian Hate
"Jordan Clarkson bringing this to attention and bringing this more out in the open explains why it is so important for representation in mainstream spaces.I don’t think this gets the attention it does in a world where a prominent Filipino-American calling out his own community. Most of the time people mentioning Jordan Clarkson in an international context, people people wrongly assume he got Filipino citizenship to continue playing basketball and make jokes about him just trying to get on any Olympic team not realizing he actually is part Filipino based on blood. However, it’s clear that he is actually cares for and is proud to be a representative for the Philippines."
He's like the opposite of Jordan Clarkson.
"Ordinary FIBA Rubio statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Jordan Clarkson type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
Jordan Clarkson isnt even bald
"Every player's absolute floor is 'so bad he is out of the league before his rookie contract is up'.  Most people are referring to the low end of the scenarios that seem realistic.    That said, I do think Lavine is too high, and it should be more like Jordan Clarkson or Malik Beasley or something like that."
&gt;perfect in the Jordan clarkson 6th man role  I really couldn't disagree more lol. I don't hate Oubre but he has none of the guile or wiggle that Clarkson has. Oubre isos like he thinks he is Zion Williamson... crashing into people and going for the drive. The only thing he has in common with Clarkson is not passing
&gt;	I think he’d be perfect in the Jordan clarkson 6th man role.  Problem is that *he* doesn't think this. He thinks he's an All Star starter that just hasn't gotten the chance.
"Idk about bouncing around. He wasn’t great on the wizards, but he is pretty universally loved here in phx. He was awesome for us. The Chris Paul trade just outweighed our love for him and rubio. But we had no issue with either guy.   He for sure isn’t the highest bbiq guy though. He can get hot, but ideally he’s your 3-4th best player. I think he’d be perfect in the Jordan clarkson 6th man role. But he’s just a high energy high effort guy."
was just a jordan clarkson viewing party to make him feel better
"yeah, like a joe ingles, jordan clarkson, bojan bogdanovic"
Not too high on him either I see his ceiling as a sixth man spark plug like Jordan Clarkson but let’s wait too see his development before me we make final judgement
When did Jordan Clarkson retire?
He's gonna be our microwave scorer. Jordan Clarkson/Lou will type.  His defence is bad due to his lack of awareness and short wingspan. But he's an elite C&amp;S 3pt shooter who needs to work on his decision making and handle to reach the next level.
"It's baffling how the media is reporting on him as if he is some big prize when in reality he is much closer to Jordan Clarkson territory. He had two below average efficiency seasons prior to missing a season with an ACL tear and teams are supposedly bidding to pay him $20M+? Doesn't make sense to me either, he seems much more like a 3 year $45M guy to me."
The one who told Jordan Clarkson to stop acting light skin when going to the whole
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here. THT, Kuz, Hart, Nance, etc. Only 2 out and out bad picks.  46	LAL	Talen Horton-Tucker 25	LAL	Moritz Wagner 39	LAL	Isaac Bonga 47	LAL	Svi Mykhailiuk 27	LAL	Kyle Kuzma 30	LAL	Josh Hart 42	LAL	Thomas Bryant 32	LAL	Ivica Zubac 27	LAL	Larry Nance Jr. 34	LAL	Anthony Brown 46	LAL	Jordan Clarkson"
"What I think most folks don’t completely understand yet is the importance of what the team does after drafting such guys.  The Lakers and their batch of young guys in the last few years are an excellent example.  The following guys were all on the Lakers roster: Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, DeAngelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball  The Lakers, when they had them, weren’t really about player development. So these guys faltered and were considered bench/role players at best. Now they’re all bonafide starters in the league.  The Spurs spent years developing Kawhi into the beast he is. Raptors have slowly but surely developed the non-lottery likes of OG, VanVleet, Siakam. Denver got an injured Michael Porter Jr falling to them, and, that’s a multiple time All-Star in the making.  Some teams are just better at player development than others. So yea, Jokic’s amazing in Denver, but had he been drafted by the Kings or Detroit, maybe he’d never have reached this point.  All this to say, the Kings suck, and should be relocated to Seattle. Thanks for reading."
Ingles trying to bring out his inner Jordan Clarkson for the last quarter
He’s good and I have nothing against him but I irrationally hate the way Jordan Clarkson plays.
"Bilas' Best Available #1: Jordan Clarkson  great pick up by the Lakers. Glad to see JC's success, when people talk about our old ""young core"" they usually forget him and Nance lol"
Odds are he's Jordan Clarkson. Just a quick eyeball math shows the history of the #11 pick is around a 25% chance at an All Star with maybe a 50% bust rate... although the last decade has been great for #11's.
"Jordan Clarkson is Bouknight's floor.  As a Holy BouKnight squire, I believe his ceiling is....JAMAL MURRAY  I KNOW! HERESY"
Don't forget about 6th man of the year Jordan Clarkson!
Jordan Clarkson
"A lot of ex-Lakers have flourished the past few years beyond their Laker days.  Julius Randle Jordan Clarkson D'Angelo Russell Brandon Ingram Brook Lopez Ivica Zubac Lou Williams  This is just from memory, could be more."
I hope he has a Jordan Clarkson-esque resurgence
"Quickley is a super great shooting so that would be hard to meet. Definitely possible. Like you said he might a better finisher than quickley but with him being less than 170 and in a worse conference than what quickley was in there is at least some concern there about if it will fully translate   Actually for me barton has a super great handle (to me that’s his best skill) and offensively I’d say that’s a knock on hyland. He’s got long legs and you can see he dribbles high as well. You can see that with his somewhat concerning amount of turnovers. Also Barton can play the 3 and is decently switchable, I don’t see that for hyland. Then with hyland’s a range compared to Barton.   That’s why a quickley or Jordan clarkson comp makes a bit more sense to me, hyland would have some concerns playing with our starters full time but playing  in a supercharged bench role with either facu/Monte i could see him tear it up"
The Jalen Green pick is dope. Going to be rooting for a fellow country-man (he’s part Filipino due to his mother so I’ll take it like Jordan Clarkson 🤷🏻‍♂️).
"Lakers have done pretty well with 2nd round picks.  THT, Jordan Clarkson, and Zubac come to mind.  This article quotes another article that states that the Lakers are the 3rd best drafting team since 2009.  https://lakersnation.com/data-shows-lakers-are-third-best-drafting-team-since-2009/2021/07/28/"
For a second there I was thinking why were the Hawks going after Jordan Clarkson
"I don’t. I don’t see him having starting potential, he’s a bad fit with our starters. However could he be some sort of Jordan clarkson guy off the bench, maybe. Might take a few years for that though"
"lmao I still can't believe they chose to keep Kuz over Julius Randle, Lonzo, Ingram, Larry Nance, and Jordan Clarkson"
You guys need more high upside guys and Bouknight is probably going to be Jordan Clarkson (and you guys already have so many solid rotation pieces).
His ceiling is jordan clarkson pre jazz
"Lonzo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivica Zubac.   Jordan Clarkson, Svi Mykhailiuk Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, Thomas Bryant."
Possibly. I honestly think Bouknight just ends up being a better Jordan Clarkson. Guy has major tunnel vision
Nets are an offense-first team. Lakers are a defense-first team.  Kuzma will thrive ala Jordan Clarkson in a 6-man/fourth option role for the Nets.
"From one bias fan to another. These medicore laker players we laker fans  just love to hype up such as jordan clarkson, larry nance, bradon ingram, josh hart, lonzo ball, julius randle and dlo actually do shockingly well on other teams."
convince Lakers to trade up 5 spots from 46 to 41. Nikola Jokic might be a little better than Jordan Clarkson
"* 100% agree with you green, dudes gonna be jordan clarkson 2.0 * Suggs and Mobley will make more than 4 all star games"
"Star: Cade  Bust: Kuminga (I think he has a chance of being one if he goes to the wrong team, I like his upside though)  Steal: Cam Thomas (I think he can be a Jordan Clarkson type player, and would be a great pick if he falls to late first round)"
"Exactly. He’s not a bad player by any means, but he is limited and his best role on a winning team is as a sixth man like Jordan Clarkson. An excellent young scorer that’s also a great locker room presence, but isn’t good enough in other areas of his game to be a starter on a playoff team."
"I wish our front office had realized this was a situation similar to Jordan Clarkson, when we should’ve shipped him out when his value was the highest around the year we drafted him or after. When he was getting compared to Tatum, I think at that point you have to call BS and start looking for some team to sucker."
"He also takes tough shots which is why his 3 pt % is low, but he is one of the best shot creaters in the draft and plays like CJ McCollum/Jordan Clarkson"
"It says more about the kind of skillset that enables success in FIBA ball vs the NBA imo. Patty Mills is a worse player than Jordan Clarkson in the NBA (feel free to debate this, just an example) but FIBA schemes reward players who can dissect and execute sets and read the floor vs the NBA, where the shooting is so good that a lot of ball handlers can feast off their ball handling and athleticism alone"
Fred is closer to Jordan Clarkson than he is to Lowry.  I have no idea why anyone would be high on him.
"Fans on the Jazz sub aren't ice cold on the idea. Personally, I wouldn't mind the trade. As much as we love Joe (and he will always be a Jazz legend), he is losing steam. Kuzma fills some gaps, and we still have solid 3-point shooting without Jingles. Plus, as Jordan Clarkson shows, Quin Snyder knows how to use players' strengths. I have always thought Kuz could flourish if given more of a chance. Him and Donovan could complement each other well. Just hope it's true that he can actually be more consistent given a more clear role."
"Guy is a little delusional LOL, comparing 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson to Jordan Poole is like comparing Jordan Clarkson to Michael Jordan"
The Jazz have a play that Quin Snyder called “Baby” that I remembered him calling out and remembering the play. I have it included at 0:32 of the video below. It is a side pick and roll with two guards exchanging spots on the wide side and a shooter in the strong corner. In this example Gobert’s rolling gravity opens a shot for Jordan Clarkson coming from the elbow to the top of the key.   https://youtu.be/owAPqsVAYiw
"Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivaca Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, Alex Caruso 🔥"
"He actually has done whatever has been asked of him. A lot like when Jordan Clarkson was on the Lakers.  * He’s been a primary scorer (first couple years)  * he’s been a floor spacing 4 and even stretch 5 (that didn’t work at all) * he’s imitated the offense and been a playmaker * he’s been a go-to defender (short lived but it was hugely important to the 2020 title) * he’s been a dedicated rebounder (this season, some value on a tired team) * he’s been an excellent cutter (really helps our offense and needs to be replaced)   The one thing he hasn’t been is a star. A star would be able to do all of those things consistently at a high level.   Kuzma can do one thing at a time, inconsistently.  If he’s carrying the offense? He’s not rebounding and defending. If he’s rebounding and defending he won’t cut and his shot falls apart.  This inability to handle medium to large loads is exactly why he fails as a 6th man.   A 6th man needs to be able to transition from a bit player with the starting 5 to a practical All Star against bench players.  Kuzma can’t do that. He’s really more of a 7th man. He’s a good utility player that does well with starters and benches.   In a brand new environment or when he fully matures into a consistent role he may break out like Clarkson. But that’s what Kuzma does"
yet another second rate scoring PG that wants big boy money without the credentials of Lou Will or Jordan Clarkson. GMs shouldn't even be offering 60% of what they ask
"jordan clarkson,wayne ellington, ryan kelly,tarik black, robert sacre. Motherfucking sacre."
"italy has a few guys   simone fontechio 25 years old 6'6 a good shooter with some iso scoring game kind of like a poor mans bogdonovic (the one on the jazz)   achile Polonara 29 years old 6'8 power forward- good, shooter, an average athlete, not that huge or athletic but competes on defense.  he was one of the best players in euroleague and the acb last year.     czech republic   ONdre Balvin- 28 years old 7 footer, plays hard defense, backup center.   Australia  Jock Landale- 25 years old, back up center  france  nando could of been a back up pg/6th man scorer. kind of like jordan clarkson esq. he is 34 now, so don't quite see the point of signing him.   &amp;#x200B;  thats about it for guys i have seen.  nick kay and agada on nigeria don't interest me much.   with argentina, vildoza and deck were just signed last year by the knicks and okc.  deck is pretty good, vildoza is pretty whatever to me."
"A bunch of the knicks young guys. Like Mitchell Robinson and Quickley. They aren’t super hyped up and maybe it’s because that fanbase is so large, but seriously don’t get what’s so special with them.  Specifically for the pelicans, I’m not sure why the fanbase is ready to roll NAW out in the starting lineup. I think he projects to be a Jordan Clarkson/6th man spark plug guy rather than a starter."
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, and a good handful of others have achieved mediocrity at best on the Lakers(with maybe the exception being Brandon Ingram), only to flourish and improve once they left the Lakers.  The Lakers have done some pretty solid drafting the past six years or so, but they have done a terrible job at actually developing the players they draft."
"A side tournament would probably be too much and too serious.  But just a skills challenge replacement. Doesn't even have to be top guys, somebody like Jordan Clarkson would kick ass in it, not to mention if it was top guys, Kyrie going against Curry? That's better than any dunk contest they can make now..."
Why are we disrespecting Jordan Clarkson?
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Jordan Clarkson type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
Jordan Clarkson
Microwave scorers like Jordan Clarkson are fun to watch.      He won the Jazz many games last season and had some unbelievable take overs like his 41 points vs GSW with like 30 in the fourth and his 17 points in 2:30 against the Clippers in game 6.      Klay Thompson probably also fits this archetype.
The odd thing is he’s not really a pg but more an undersized two guard. He’s a liability on defense. So he’s fit really well with either a team with a big pg or a point forward type. He’d work great in Dallas I think. He’s overqualified to be a sixth man type ala Jordan Clarkson but for a championship team he’d be incredible at it.
"Don’t like the Shai and Cade comp. Shai is significantly better as a ball handler but Cade is stronger and a better defender. Shai is more of a Kyrie type player whereas Cade is like Tatum or a less athletic PG13 but with somewhat better playmaking.  Green and LaVine is pretty solid.  Mobley and Bosh is a bit optimistic for Mobleys offense but not bad.  Suggs is super athletic, he’s more of a Jrue Holiday IMO.  Moody and Mikal is fine but pretty optimistic  Kuminga’s ceiling comp is more of a Jaylen Brown. Less optimistically, I guess Kelly Oubre. Floor is maybe more explosive Stanley Johnson.  Bouk is more of a Jordan Clarkson or Raptors Demar Derozan, an athletic scoring guard.  Davion and Jrue is fine. Realistically he’s a more athletic Pat Bev though.  Wagner-Ariza is ok I guess.  Scottie is much more of a big than OG, and OG, while a solid passer, doesn’t playmake like Scottie. I’d say he’s more like Draymond at the very high end, Rondae Hollis Jefferson on the low end."
"&gt;Wiseman had a historically bad rookie season for a top 2 pick  The same rookie that had COVID, had no camp, was a C in the most complex offensive and defensive scheme in the league and had the tightest leash of any rookie in the top 5? If you actually watched him (Which I can't actually tell if you did) you'd see that he was extremely raw but he had talent. There's a reason so many teams are perpetuating ""Wiseman + Picks"" trades.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Wiggins is 26 and not part of the future  Why? Why does that even matter? What a useless statement.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Poole spent half of last season in the g-league, the hopeful ceiling for him is Jordan Clarkson  Yeah he did. Your point? And no, the Jordan Clarkson comp is awful lmao. He does not have any of the playmaking or offball skills Poole does. Find a better comp.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The prospects projected at 7 and 14 are projected to be role players  They are? According to who? Moody and Bouk have All Star upside and the 14th pick has options like Giddey and Ziaire who are incredibly raw but have just as incredible upside, easily All Star.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Refusing to trade a disappointing top 2 pick and Jordan Poole for an all-star to help a core of 3 HOF players seems incredibly stupid.  Tell me, who? Siakam? Then how would our roster work? We'd have 2 injured starters during the start of our season, we'd have no real 3 to guard Wings, too much pressure on Klay, Siakam isn't naturally a 5 and Dray won't play the 5 for too long.  Beal? Yeah, he's an option, but I'd rather go for a 2 way wing. If the FO deems that he can defend well enough, then I'm fine with it, but if they don't, I get why they wouldn't want him. I'd rather wait till next offseason when Wiggins is a MASSIVE expiring contract and go for a big trade with him for a 3."
Jordan Clarkson with Nash/Kobe/Pau
"Zion played less than half the season... Was not as good as Randle. And that's not mentioning D'Angelo Russel, Jordan Clarkson, Brook Lopez, and Kyle Kuzma. The latter 2 of which were playing heavy minutes on the last 2 championship teams."
"He’s also a better rebounder than Bam. And a better floor spacer (anyone who watched that first round series between Heat-Bucks knows how important floor spacing is). They’re pretty close to equal passers.   Bam’s a better defender for sure, but you can’t pretend like KAT is some Jordan Clarkson or Lou Will type who literally only scores. He’s literally good at every single part of offense and is elite at most aspects. He’s also a very good rebounder."
The equivalent of Jordan Clarkson as your second option on a title team
"Oh man, I can name a few from the 2013-2019 dark years:  - Larry Nance Jr. making his own basket against the Clippers on Christmas 2015  - Robert Sacre inbounding it to fucking Jae Crowder and then fouling him as he makes the layup in a game in Dallas.  - D'Angelo Russell with that blunder on the fastbreak with Jordan Clarkson. Kobe then rolls his eyes afterwards lmao.  - Marcelo Huertas (the GOAT) and his backwards shot against the Heat.  - Jeremy Lin not fouling Mike Conley in crunch time while Kobe is yelling at him to foul so Kobe has to run up and do it himself.  - Lonzo passing up a wide open layup he could have got on the fastbreak and instead tries to pass it back to Javale McGee (who was behind him) but turns it over instead.  - LeBron not dribbling the ball to start the clock against the Nuggets and instead the ball just rolls out of bounds."
"Sexton can be our best player (right now) and still not be worth a max. All he does is put up points and nothing else. He's a good player that can help a playoff team win, but it's more of a Jordan Clarkson role than being a legit starter. SexLand isn't viable long term so one of them has to go (or at least go to the bench). Since Collin can't run the offense and will most likely demand a max this summer, it would be best to trade him if we can. But since his trade value is almost Drummond-like, the best way to go now is just match any offer sheet in RFA next summer"
"I think he can be a Jordan clarkson type 6 man, but yeah pretty much"
Because Sexton is a rich man's Jordan Clarkson. He's best as a 6th man. He's not making a lot of teammates better unlike Garland.
"That still doesnt make sense when you have young players to build around. Your pick this year, Deni, Rui, Gafford, Bryant, not to mention the picks/young player you would get for Beal as well as potentially getting Kuzma who I get didnt have the best season but is capable of having a good comeback ala jordan clarkson.   Plus if your goal is to settle for mediocrity that hinders the development of those guys I mentioned because with russ+beal pounding the ball your others guys wont develop. This accelerates it. Lose this year get a high pick this coming season and thats a good amount of young talent."
Booker a sober Jordan Clarkson    Not really but let me have it
"He's too small so no matter what he does for you offensively he's a liability on the defensive end and will be match up hunted to death. They already have an undersized guard in Garland.  It's just too much for them to keep them on the court at the same time and expect to seriously win games. Either one comes off the bench or they move one and get a player who fits better in exchange. To me Sexton is a 6th man type of player, like Lou Williams, IT, or Jordan Clarkson. He's just not big enough to stay on the court for really prolonged periods of time."
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"they are insanely valuable? lol. what is this comment  arguably a majority of teams have some sort of a ""volume shooter"" coming off the bench to be a focal point of the 2nd unit. Jordan Clarkson, Terrence Ross, Montrezl, Boucher, Melo, basically anybody who is taking about 10 shots a game while not starting. The teams that don't have one for the most part don't have successful or threatening second units."
"Yeah i really think his style of play is pretty far from traes. Trae is one of the most elite passers and at the same age has proven he can be a starting PG on a succesful team - legit they are the same age.  sexton is really closer to jordan clarkson or immanuel quickley type player. The booker comp is bad too book is a big guard who at age 22 was avging 6.8 assist ,as the 2.  they are not similar other than all 3 are volume scorers.  His upside is closer to  a smaller cj mcollum than trae or book.  but my impression from watching him is he is jordan clarkson.  i guess your point is that trae and book suffered from similar criticism but that doesn't mean that sexton's criticism isn't warranted."
hes like if jordan clarkson was your starting pg and hes about to get a max contract...
yeah sexton is never going to be as good as Trae or Book. its not at all the same.  not saying his stats are empty but that also isnt a good comp.  Sexton is like a jordan clarkson he would be great in a 6th man role.
"The problem is, New Orleans has playoff aspirations. They can’t afford to let these guys grow and develop with Zion. They need to start winning like yesterday. Realistically, as is the case with most draft picks, neither NAW nor Kira will become anything special. The Pels time is better served by not wasting any more of Zions time on development. He’s ready to go now. NAW and Kira are literally years (if ever) off  Edit: I like Kira more than NAW. I definitely get Jordan Clarkson vibes from NAW and it took a while for JC to become good. NAW is simply a low iq gunner at this point. You don’t want the ball in his hands when you have Zion and Ingram on the court"
"I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that likes that potential backcourt of Kira and NAW, though I do think NAW is probably better off being a Jordan Clarkson-esque gunner off the bench, at least as of right now."
"KCP got paid every year though.   Jordan Clarkson got paid.   Tristan got Paid. Gary Trent JR..Paid.  Terrence Ross, Dejounte Murray.  Marcus Morris had a great deal from the Spurs but Marcus turned it down.   Mikes Bridges, Darius Garland…all got paid well.    So where is this narrative that if you’re not a star e doesn’t get you paid?"
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
Jordan Clarkson saying dinosaurs were just pets to larger humans might even top the flat earth stuff.   Some other great episodes are when Gilbert and Nick Young were guests (the full uncensored one is better than the chopped up edited one)   Tim Duncan was great as well
"Why stop at 2? I want to see D’Lo, Jordan Clarkson, Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, and Devin Booker mix it up in a segment all about dating Kendall Jenner.  Also, it’s funny how Blake Griffin stands out so much in that list, but he’s only 3 years older than Clarkson."
Kyrie wasn’t on the 2018 Cavs finals team ? Their best guard was JR Smith ? Maybe Jordan Clarkson ?
"Jordan Clarkson, he has the ideal playstyle for 2k"
Jordan Clarkson probs has the best situation for a 'Lou Will/bucket getter' type of player.  Brought on for offense and doesnt have to worry about defense since Utah is fine in that department.
"Fr. He probably won’t crack their rotation, but he would be great in a Jordan Clarkson type role."
Cam Thomas has been watching Jordan Clarkson film
Jordan Clarkson regen
"Tyler Herros ceiling is an elite 6th man like a Jordan Clarkson. As for Kendrick Nunn he was a starter for most of the 20-21 season and would of won roty if he didn’t get covid (he finished 2nd in voting) I can see him being the better player potentially, he was also more consistent and more aggressive then Herro,and I think he’d have the better career starting with winning a chip (or 2) with Lebron in LA"
"Rudy gay, Hassan Whiteside, Jordan Clarkson, Jared Butler, Joe Ingles. Oh wait. That's the Jazz's 2nd team... Damn we're deep"
"With how well jordan clarkson works for us off the bench, this honestly sounds like a great idea"
"This is the same game where Jordan Clarkson dropped 40 points vs ”””DPOY candidate””” Ben Simmons, right?"
outplayed by Jordan Clarkson
"His problem was he was on an upward trajectory in his first two years and then the Lakers brought in AD and it wildly changed what the Lakers were looking for from Kuzma. He never settled in to just being a scorer off the bench like Lou Williams or Jordan Clarkson. He flourished as a starter who was counted on to score a lot, and maybe he'll get that chance again in Washington. But if he's destined to be a bench player forever then I don't think he'll realistically improve from where he is right now. Not unless he makes a major leap forward as an outside shooter."
"Sure, but Green has yet to play an NBA game and for all we know is just another Jordan Clarkson type of 6th man scorer.   &amp;#x200B;  We know Edwards floor and thats a player that can give you great scoring on a nightly basis, we dont know Greens thats why this question probably shouldnt had been asked this early to begin with."
Some dude named Jordan. Jordan Clarkson.
Jazz about to try this with Michael Conley and Jordan Clarkson
Because Jordan Clarkson doesn't play for any other team right now
"You did have that reporter who asked jordan clarkson how he spelt his name .  Grooming him for the big leagues, when he asks ""can you spell KD"" ? or ""LBJ"" , or ""Katie"""
"This would also only happen in Utah. Jordan Clarkson plays for the Jazz that she asked about, doesn't wear helmet like football players and actually won an award that made him fully visible."
How many of those games does Jordan Clarkson go to?
&gt; Kind of surprised Malik Monk isn't starting tbh  Monk's role on a good team is not dissimilar from somebody like Jordan Clarkson.
Kuz is better than the haters would have you believe.  Never had a defined role in LA due to our constantly changing roster but always made the best with what he has and tried to do what was asked of him.  He has better than Lamar Odom/Jordan Clarkson 6th man potential if  someone is willing to give him the green light.
Jordan Clarkson
"Is Jordan Clarkson, Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neal and Bogdanovic clearly better than Reggie Jackson, Terrance Mann, Batum and Morris?   I'd say they're pretty even.  Clippers had the two best players in the series."
Yeah because the basketball fans here ripping her for not knowing who Jordan Clarkson are the same type of people that would also give her shit if she misspelled their name on air.
People really harassing a local reporter's social media because she doesn't know who Jordan Clarkson is smh
"Unrelated fun stat I just noticed during the game:  Tyler Herro averages more FGA per game than LaMelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, Karl-Anthony Towns, Fred VanVleet, Jordan Clarkson, Joel Embiid, and James Harden."
"I know Bulls flairs are getting their dicks hard about trading Coby for a serviceable 4, but he's far and away the best scorer we have off the bench. Dude can be our Lou Will/Jordan Clarkson type 6th man who just goes on tears against other bench units, Ayo looks stellar for a second round pick but he'd have to have this kind of night every night for me to get comfortable with the idea of trading Coby"
"I like Sexton but you are way too high on him. From what we know his best position might be 6th man like Lou Wil, Jordan Clarkson."
Jazz not falling further is an extremely respectful choice. We need it to stop being Jordan Clarkson Time^^tm for a minute or the slide will continue.
"I think Sexton might just become a off the bench spark plug like Jordan Clarkson, Lou Will. His shooting % lowered a lot this season but its only 11 games. We have time."
Jordan Clarkson is shooting over 13 threes per 36 minutes and hitting less than 22% of them.
"Yeah he's fine if he knows his role.....Off the bench scorer...like another guy we shouldn't have gotten rid of, Jordan Clarkson.  His play style doesnt mesh with Garland, not because both are too short to be a playoff-starting backcourt, but doesnt fit into the flow of moving the ball around and execution.   Looking at Sexton's number he's been extremely inefficient, forcing things, esp like the end of last game. He was getting locked down and playing out of control. In that case he should be playing off the ball not with it and move with the flow of the offense. So yeah can he score in bunches, thats a good trait. But he needs to be able to do that in the flow of the game and execute. If Cavs want to make the playoffs and actually have a chance, they get Sexton to move to the bench (which he wont, he wants that money) or more likely package and trade him for more starting wing help, since if you dont have a solid two way 3 in this league you will be sunk with all the point forwards like Giannis, Lebron, Kawhi, etc all around. Seriously even Ben Simmons would fit this team better than Sexton because Ben passes and plays defense very well. As far as his shooting inadequacies, the Cavs are loaded with shooters now that Windler decided to stop being injured and Ricky Rubio is shooting 3's at a higher clip than Steph Curry! I like Sexton too, his heart and hustle, but if you want to see team success in the playoffs, you have to build your team that way and get in the right pieces. Just like the Bucks did last year, everyone on that team is extremely selfless (Getting rid of selfish Bledsoe for Jrue Holiday was masterful) and passes the ball....that's how you win championships. Sexton=OBJ right now"
He couldnt wipe Shai's ass as a scorer man. Shai does that efficiently while getting doubled and tripled with no spacing. Hes playing with steph curry bro I've watched every game he's played with yall he does not get doubled and tripled lmao. Put that guy on any other team and his numbers are way worse. You don't know ball if you think Poole is even near the same stratosphere as Shai as a player man. plays good for 6 out of the 10 games and yall act like he big time. His peak is Jordan Clarkson which is a really good sixth man. Yall got the best scoring guard of all time on your roster you don't understand what that does for the rest of the players around him.
By your logic Jordan Clarkson was better than Chris Paul last season lmao. Your guy is not getting doubled and tripled every game he is a good scoring role player and that's it. Get buckets against the second unit and get threes when Steph has dragged half the defense to the otherside of the floor and you are facing the worst defender. Thats his whole job in life.
"Lakers are relevant regardless of how good they are. Heck some of y’all could analyze the Lakers might be my second favorite team but it’s really not. It’s because a lot of my friends are Lakers fans. I remember my friend ranting about Ryan Kelly being the next KD, Jordan Clarkson being a 2nd round steal that looked like their very own Russell Westbrook. In fact, I’m familiar with names like DJ Mbenga and Theo Ratcliffe coz they’re the scrubs that help Kobe win the championship."
Gary Trent seems to have followed Jordan Clarkson with his tattoos
"I mean their fans are in a perpetual state of mass delusion. They have so many fans and so many nba voices cater to their fans that they are able to tune out any unpleasant reality they choose. I remember for years being told that kuzma was a future star, that jordan clarkson was a future all star, josh hart was so great, blah blah blah. They are always full of these guys who project to be the role players whose name nobody would know if they weren't lakers but I have to hear about them like they're future all stars. Look at how they've handled their draft picks over the last 10 years and try to argue they aren't a horribly run franchise. The off season debacles they've had in recent years only follows that. The fact that Lebron came to the Lakers and he got AD to demand his way to the lakers is the only reason they've become a winning team again."
Idk really. Trae even when he tries (which is inconsistent but better than what it used to be) talented scorers still get what they want usually. A more disciplined Westbrook can do more defensively obviously but that’s never been the case.  Westbrook just has less of an excuse to be as bad as he is on that end considering his gifts. Trae played great defense on a possession against Jordan Clarkson the other night and he just hit the step back 3 in his grill like it was nothing.
With a lot of hard work I think he can be as good as Jordan Clarkson one day
Herro is far better than Jordan Clarkson has ever been lol
Yeah I don’t get comments like this. It’s like where were you guys all of last year? Lmao.   If you’re going to make the argument that he was bad because he didn’t grow last year then you have to inherently assume his peak is way higher than just Jordan Clarkson.
I’m not saying this is his ceiling but if Herro turns into a Jordan Clarkson type ultra green light 6th man he will have a very successful career
"Nobody mad. Warriors fans think Jordan Poole is gonna be an all star, he’s Jordan Clarkson 2.0  Good scorer off the bench when Klay comes back."
And behind Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson
&gt;Poole seems like a volume scorer that needs his touches.  How hilariously wrong of a take bruh. You also believe the Jordan Clarkson comps?
Jordan Clarkson ? Just asking
"Are you counting Jordan Clarkson as their second best scorer. Gobert is their first or second best player easily but not sure of their ""second best scorer"""

Jordan Clarkson really plays like a 2K creation
Jordan Clarkson. It's safe to say that he attends a lot of jazz basketball games
"39 points in the first half, 77 in the second  I need some of whatever super soldier serum Jordan Clarkson took at halftime"
Jordan Clarkson started this game with 5 points on 8 field goal attempts in the first half. He finished the game with 30 points on 19 field goal attempts
"Gotta be the best player on the team first. He’s actually been having the least efficient year of his career so far. The +\- stuff so far has mostly been some crazy shooting splits with the Mitchell/Whiteside group and the Conley/Gobert group. Jordan Clarkson being the leagues premier bricklayer insofar really hasn’t done any favors to the latter lineup. Also I swear opponents are shooting sub 15% from 3 whenever Whiteside’s on the floor, and Mitchell’s always on at the same time.   Rudy’s the MVP of this team unless Donovan starts permanently playing like his last playoff runs and hitting 47% from 3 on 10 attempts a game. The +/- stuff will probably flip back closer to what it was last year eventually."
Jordan Clarkson Jr?
Lol you have not watched a Cavs game this year. Enjoy Jordan Clarkson Jr.
Watch Jordan Clarkson this season and you will be a truther
Jordan Clarkson gets no recognition smh
"Wins are the only thing that matter bro, that's why Lillard sucks and Jordan Clarkson is the GOAT"
"Not too much expectations + lot of money = dream job  Didnt he once say, he wanted to be like jordan clarkson ? it all comes together, lmao"
He's no different to Jordan Clarkson for me.
hoping to trade jordan clarkson for him in fantasy
"Did you watch the first half? He’s pretty off, man. One in and out in the second half shouldn’t convince you he’s right there. The fact he’s Jordan Clarkson should, but let’s not pretend his shots were all that close tonight in general."
He's damn good.  Could be a more athletic Jordan Clarkson in his prime.
"Whoever can fix it, we would like to send Jordan Clarkson there too 😶"
jordan clarkson ... top5 lowest IQs in the nba
"yeah but you can't teach that kind of explosiveness and athleticism. I agree.i think KPJ is more of a SG, but you guys are at the stage where you are just developing young talent. if KPJ turns into a 18 ppg microwave type guy like Jordan Clarkson, and Jalen Green can work on his shot selection and start scoring at the level hes capable of, with Woof &amp; Sengun, i would take that core as a top 10 young core in the league. I also like Garuba and Josh Christopher"
"Kelly Oubre, Jordan Clarkson, Jalen Green"
How could we forget that legendary 297 point game from Jordan Clarkson?
There's been people on here talking about how he's Jordan Clarkson level so I'm not putting it past anyone to say that it's 4 years 25 total rather than 4 years at 25 per.
"&gt; Not once did I imply anything of the sort. This must have occurred inside your head.   This you?  &gt; No rational player looks at Gobert and thinks “he’s the weak link in the defence, not Jordan Clarkson”. It just isn’t rational.  lmao  &gt; If you’re telling me you don’t see Jokic take it to the rack on the regular then I question how often you actually watch him.   Not what I said, but that scoring isn't always his #1 priority.   &gt; I think you’re confusing targeting Gobert with playing the game through your best player. Imo a targeted offence involves finding the weakest link in the defence (obviously not Gobert) and creating a positional mismatch.  So then is it impossible for Harden to target Steph, if it requires a positional mismatch? Or for MPJ to be targeted by Lebron/Kawhi/PG? I don't think requiring a positional mismatch is a necessary for targeting another player, I think targeting a defender is just trying to score specifically against them, and I think that's the commonly understood definition. If you asked most people I don't think they'd require a positional mismatch.  Arguing that targeting can only occur against the weakest defender is fallacious as well. Simply because it is not the optimal decision does not mean that no one makes it.  &gt; Jokic going against Gobert is actually the complete opposite of a targeted offence.  ...because they're the same position? Lmao like I said this would mean Lebron or Kawhi couldn't target MPJ, despite that being a major narrative of other playoff series the Nuggets have played.   &gt; But Clarkson definitely can’t guard him and would fair much worse than Gobert.  I mean like I said, choosing an option that is not the optimal option does not mean the sub-optimal choice isn't still targeting the player. This, again, is where you're arguing that it didn't make sense to you therefore it didn't happen.  &gt; Gobert being Jokic’s primary defender is just Utah doing their best to slow down an elite talent.  And Denver has decided that the best way to attack this is by putting Gobert on an island and making him go one-on-one vs. Jokic. This means that he will rack up fouls quicker and be less aggressive later in the game. How is that not targeting Gobert? It's specifically attacking him, on purpose.   &gt; A targeted offence involves forcing a mismatch on the opposing defence’s least preferred defender.  Targeting is not about what the defense wants, but what the offense wants. If it is more advantageous for the best defender to be attacked so that he can't defend as well later in the game, then the offense wants to attack that defender even if it isn't the best option for that specific possession. Strategy decisions in a basketball game are generally made on the scale of the game, not on a per-possession basis.   &gt; Here’s a thought exercise. The Warriors go against the Bucks in the finals. Jrue Holiday, arguably the best guard defender in the league, is tasked as Steph’s primary defender. He does as good a job as he can, but Steph being Steph still feasts and drops an efficient 30 ppg. Does that mean he was targeting Jrue as the weak link in the defence? Or did Milwaukee assign Jrue as his primary defender and Steph played well because he’s that good?  That means nothing because you're saying nothing about how the possessions actually play out. Steph could have put up 30ppg by running around screens and taking open 3s, this says nothing about how he was getting the points.  If he got some of his points by isolating Jrue, having the rest of his teammates clear out, then those possessions would be targeting Jrue. Now let me turn this thought exercise around on you: The Warriors choose to attack the Bucks' best perimeter defender, Jrue, early in the game in order to get him in foul trouble. The Warriors' best option for attacking is using their best guard, Steph. He gets 4 fouls in the first half, and can't defend Steph as aggressively in the second half. This results in the Warriors recouping more points in the second half than they lost in the first, and thus is a net positive offensive strategy. Was this not an offense targeting Jrue?"
"&gt;Your entire comments are literally “I didn’t watch it and can’t reference any play or game, but here’s why it’s impossible.  Not once did I imply anything of the sort.  If you’re telling me you don’t see Jokic take it to the rack on the regular then I question how often you actually watch him. He’s the second best post scorer in the league behind Embiid and in addition takes guys off the dribble quite often. He’s an elite, three level scorer which includes taking it to the rim, among other things.   I think you’re confusing targeting Gobert with playing the game through your best player. Imo a targeted offence involves finding the weakest link in the defence (obviously not Gobert) and creating a *positional mismatch*. A great example is LeBron targeting Lou Williams in those Lakers/Clippers matchups.  Jokic going against Gobert is actually the complete opposite of a targeted offence. A targeted offence would have Jokic posting up Jordan Clarkson, Mike Conley and the like. Don’t get me wrong, Gobert can’t guard Jokic effectively. But Clarkson *definitely* can’t guard him and would fair much worse than Gobert.  Gobert being Jokic’s primary defender is just Utah doing their best to slow down an elite talent. Think of it this way: if Utah had the choice between Jokic posting up Gobert or posting up Donavon Mitchell, which one do you think they’d prefer? Obviously neither can stop him. But I think we both know who’d have a better chance at slowing him down. A targeted offence involves forcing a mismatch on the opposing defence’s *least* preferred defender.  Here’s a thought exercise. The Warriors go against the Bucks in the finals. Jrue Holiday, arguably the best guard defender in the league, is tasked as Steph’s primary defender. He does as good a job as he can, but Steph being Steph still feasts and drops an efficient 30 ppg. Does that mean he was targeting Jrue as the weak link in the defence? Or did Milwaukee assign Jrue as his primary defender and Steph played well because he’s that good?"
"I’m sure spouting “anybody who disagrees with me doesn’t watch basketball” is what you consider to be a valid point. Unfortunately your comments aren’t based in reality.  You’re confusing Jokic being able to score effectively against Gobert with hunting Gobert down specifically as a weakness in the defence. Same with the other guys. Being able to score against him effectively is not even close to the same thing as hunting him down as a weak point in the defence.   Jokic doesn’t specifically *look* to score against Gobert. He’s just good enough of a scorer to understand that he’s capable of scoring regardless of who’s guarding him. Like no shit it’d be easier for him to post up fucking Mike Conley and Donavan Mitchell. No rational player looks at Gobert and thinks “he’s the weak link in the defence, not Jordan Clarkson”. It just isn’t rational."
"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I’m not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It’a a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he’s been with the Hornets he’s drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte’ Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."
"also: Kyle Kuzma, THT, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Ivica Zubac.    not on the level of Spurs &amp; Raptors, but still a good return"
Since his COVID diagnostic I would agree with you but he was the best player on a ECF team. Which is more than Herro can say.   I think people get salty cause I’m “hating” on Herro but there’s a difference between dunking on a guy and being honest about someone production.   No one is saying Jordan Clarkson is in the same tier as Trae either. And people will still get mad that I’m only comparing Herro to a 6MotY🙄
I would take Mobley and Barnes over Cade or Green.   Cade and Green are so underwhelming. I will be shocked if Jalen Green is a better player than current Jordan Clarkson.
Jordan Clarkson vs the Milwaukee Bucks
I like the idea of Cole Anthony off the bench in a Jordan Clarkson role. He can create his own shot better than Fultz.
"Sort of hard to calculate it in bulk since the 2019-2020 season messes everything up and you have to modify it by hand depending on how many games their team platyed... but so far it looks like:  Buddy Hield and Joe Ingles with 99% of available games played, T.J. McConnell with 97%, and Andrew Wiggins with 96%. Then a bunch around 95% like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jordan Clarkson, Damian Lillard, and Harrison Barnes."
"Man I long for the day when basketball fans stop looking at ppg as the height of meaningful performance metrics.  Sexton is awful at literally everything other than iso scoring and transition. Those are two very valuable skills, which is how he remains a decent player. But seriously, he is terrible at every single other thing. So no, he is not worth a mask. His ideal role on a contender is sixth man. He's basically Jordan Clarkson."
"The team plays better with him off the floor and has since he came into the league. He's Jordan Clarkson 2.0, best as a bench scorer. Undersized chucking shooting guards are next to no-defence scoring centers as the player archetype you are going to get yourself in the most trouble with."
"I had this opinion his first two years, but I think he's filling out nicely. I don't want to give up on him, but how amazing would it be if he was a 6th man on the squad?   A Jordan Clarkson type role would be absolute money for sexton, although I think his ceiling is a starting caliber guard, he just hadn't reached it yet for a playoff team."
Why not say Jordan Clarkson if you’re just going to compare him to Jazz player lol?
"Yeah remember that ""bum"" 2018 Cavs team? Bron had the ball so much that solid on ball players like George Hill and Jordan Clarkson, looked like bums, despite being solid. They just never got to dribble so they kinda forgot how to. Obviously the offense is better the more the ball is in lebron's hands, but still the individual parts became less"
Jordan Clarkson too
"Bro, have you LOOKED at his playoff stats for the past SEVERAL years?  This isn't narrative based, it's fucking fact.  If he can't even win against the worst version of my bum ass choke-job team in the playoffs when he has Paul George on his team, then there's a real problem.  Y'all are blind as hell if you think he's a useful NBA starter in any capacity.  Maybe he can help a team as a 6th man at a Jordan Clarkson price, but that's about it."
"Not saying we come close to them but what amounted to a G League team led by Dlo and Jordan Clarkson spanked the shit out of the all time 2016 Warriors team.  If we’re doing this repeatedly, every night, with everyone, then I’ll be concerned. Most of the contending teams coming into this season aren’t doing very well, and we’re also missing a good portion of our starting lineup. Lebron is also literally the only playable SF we have."
"lol Kuzma does not have to be a number one option. He isn’t the number one option on the Wizards and he’s doing just fine. All I said was the offensive system revolves completely around LeBron and that isn’t good for player development. He turns other guys into complementary specialist because he doesn’t play off ball that much. A guy like Curry helps younger players develop better because he doesn’t dominate the ball as much as LeBron. You see this happening now with Poole breaking out. He also hasn’t forced the front office to sell their future to compete now. The Warriors got Poole looking good and are looking set up to be alright in the future with Moody, Kuminga and Wiseman. LeBron with his heliocentric scheme and intolerance for rookies does not make for a good situation for Kuzma to be in or any young guy for that matter because he forces them into a simple role. That’s why Lonzo, BI, Kuzma, Kyrie, Jordan Clarkson and others broke out after separating with LeBron. They had more freedom to expand their game and we’re free of the LeBron centric system."
"Remember when Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson and Derrick Rose were n the Cavs a few years ago and a ton of people said that they sucked, and all of them went on to play very well elsewhere. I think Lebron is a great passer and very versatile and people conflate that with making everyone better."
"Kids 15 years old or younger, when they see MJ's switch layup in 1991 Finals, aren't amazed. For good reason. They grew up watching even a role player like Jordan Clarkson do reverse layup on a regular basis. But at the time MJ did it, no one has done something like that before. He innovate, they imitate. Same thing as Mr. Cousy. Nobody handled and passed like he did. That's why he's a great. The game evolves, yes. These great players are the reason that the game evolves.   Same thing in BJJ. Royce Gracie showed the world something it has never seen before. Fast forward to today, do you think a matchup with someone like Dustin Poirier would be good for him? He'd probably get beat up by Dustin but that doesn't make Royce less great. The game and Dustin's game got to where it is today thanks to the predecessors and pioneers.  This is what Kareem meant when he said he sees LeBron passing his all-time scoring record as a ""human achievement"" rather than a ""personal achievement"". The ones who got next has been proven it can be done. So they will train hard to achieve it, not only believing it is achievable but knowing."
jordan clarkson...larry nance...sigh they always our kids even if they dont wear the purple and gold.
"its sort of high key--there were three 6 man of the year finalists last year  2 top vote getters?  thats right, jordan clarkson and joe ingles  we got the 6th and 7th man of the year"
"Jordan Clarkson. Dude can get his shot off from anywhere, looking smooth as possible, and is a walking bucket."
Jordan Clarkson is scoring 16pts/game on 39/60/91 splits + a steal off the bench this season so far for the Jazz.
Prime Jordan Clarkson comes out with about 4 minutes left in the 2nd quarter and goes away at the 2 minute mark. So for 2 minutes he’s basically Jordan with a 3pt shot.
"whoever scores the most points off the bench, jordan clarkson maybe"
Is prime Jordan Clarkson now?
"I absolutely know I’m biased but there are a lot of reasons to be. Mike Conley is starting off the season playing the way he ended last season (aka really good). Donovan has started this season a little slow but if the playoffs are anything to go off of we have nothing to worry about with him. Bogdanovic (our second top scorer last season) is back after missing the bubble with a wrist surgery. We have a 2 time DPOY with Rudy Gobert, plus Derrick Favors returning fills a massive hole in our roster when Rudy is off the court. Plus we have Jordan Clarkson who has been a walking bucket, and Joe Ingles who pairs really well at the PnR with Favors. Really just have a really solid team and our roster basically only improved since last season."

The official didn't cause the emotional reaction. Jordan Clarkson decided to react emotionally
"I can’t believe so many people are blaming the ref here. The ref was in the appropriate position given the circumstances. No one anticipated that steal, other than Jordan Clarkson.  Matter of fact, Clarkson was out of control and dribbled the ball onto the ref. Clarkson is the multi-million dollar professional. He should have the mental and physical acuity to dribble the ball correctly,  pause, or cut to the basket.  After replay, Clarkson should have been ejected. He fucked up and then pushed a ref."
Jordan clarkson should be executed for his crime
Refs are part of the field no matter what sport you play. Clarkson is the .1% level athlete it's on him to avoid the dumbass who ran ahead of the play. Imagine if he had a better handle on his steal and spun around the ref? That'd be on sport center for a decade...but no he shoved the ref and is still just Jordan Fucking Clarkson.
"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day.

My bad lol Jordan Clarkson is my dad i wont tolerate no slander intentional or not
I knew he was good but when did Jordan Clarkson become the best player of all time?
Jordan Clarkson isn't the Jazz's worst offensive player.. him coming off the bench doesnt mean shit regarding his player caliber.  He's there to rip on 2nd units and sow discord and chaos ISO beyblading around while the opponent is in the middle of adapting to the Jazz's offensive sets from the 1st quarter and their starters.

"Jordan Clarkson is a fucking bucket, he is an absolute landslide for 6MOTY right now."

That may be true but our lord and savior Jordan Clarkson is hardly a random bench player.

How did the Jazz have 9 more FTs when shooting 20 more 3s? Why don’t the same protections you get as a shooter apply to people at the rim? The same contact on Jordan Clarkson shooting a 3 is a foul but not on Ben Simmons in the paint. It’s insane

I flushed my blue chews today. I found out all I need to get hard is to watch Jordan Clarkson highlights
You know who would help.. Jordan Clarkson.... What Cha got for him?
We’re getting torched by Jordan Clarkson.
Spelled Jordan Clarkson wrong...
The minivan two threes to keep us in it in the 1st. Jordan Clarkson being a point god. And a lot of drives and good play from Bojan and Favors. Those are role players - not our stars. Gobert and Mitchell having bad games - look out when they're having good games.
Also just wanna say that Jordan Clarkson is my new favorite player. He's so fun and plays with some serious bravado.
Jordan Clarkson is like a Bradley Beal cosplayer that also somehow scores like Beal.
Jordan Clarkson is a beauty

Jordan. Clarkson Jordan.
Is Jordan Clarkson the Goat?

Does Jordan Clarkson have crazy eyes?
Jordan Clarkson half Filipino Reggie Miller apparently
Did you post this after seeing Jordan Clarkson hit 3 straight threes in 90 seconds?
He’s more Jordan than he is Clarkson
idk when Jordan Clarkson became the GOAT but I dont like it
Those probably came from Filipinos. They’ve been starved of legit basketball talent that they’ve decided to adopt Jalen Green as their own similar to Jordan Clarkson. They have 0 NBA players that originated there so they’re desperately claiming Americans with Filipino blood as “their” players. I’ve tried watching some of their best local players but even their MVP’s do not have the potential or skills to get playing time in the G League.  Jalen Green at best is just the next Justice Winslow.
I think he'd be great as an off the bench guard 6th man role. I feel he still has value as a potential starter but has to develop a bit as well. He could do what Jordan Clarkson is doing in Utah for us and that would be great. I hope we figure it out or maybe he turns the corner.
Jordan Clarkson about to get that 6th Man of the Year and Worst Tattoos award in the same year. Special.
Bobby Portis looks like Jordan Clarkson but with Julius Randle's eyes.

"As ridiculous as it sounds, Jordan Clarkson this season qualifies for this."
If this is true Jordan Clarkson is due for a 50 point game xD
Jordan Clarkson doesn’t have the name recognition to call him JC. Stop being so fucking lazy
Jordan Clarkson is shooting FTs at 97.8% this season and isn’t on the list. What am I missing?
"The Jazz are another great example of this. They have the best record in the league and currently have 7 players averaging over 20 minutes a game. Of those 7 players, 5 of them are:  - Rudy Gobert - Drafted 27th overall - Bojan Bogdanovic - Drafted 31st overall - Jordan Clarkson - Drafted 46th overall - Joe Ingles - Undrafted - Royce O'Neale - Undrafted  The only players on the roster drafted higher than 27th overall are Conley, Favors, and Mitchell. Granted, some of those players like Bogie and Clarkson were well-established with other teams before joining the Jazz but I think it's cool to see a team doing so well that is mostly comprised of late-round/undrafted guys"
Jordan Clarkson
"And Joe Ingles  And Jordan Clarkson  And Mike Conley, depending on who you ask. I think he was playing like an all-star but the way all-star selections work, there's a small chance he gets in :'("
"Lakers have been sneaky good at drafting even if you don't count Kobe (I do because West made sure they got him from the Hornets). Bynum, Marc Gasol, Randle, BI, D'lo, Jordan Clarkson, LNJ, Kuz and THT all either surpass what's expected of their draft position, or play to it for the early lottery guys. The only guy who you could really call a dissapointment is Zo, and I still think he's going to be a really good player. I'm sure I'm missing some people, but I've been"
Jordan clarkson 2.0
"okay Dwade was attacking the rim and going at people all the time, plus he didn’t really become Wade until like 05 when the last of the defensive rules were changed to curtail hand-checking, clarify blocking fouls and call defensive three seconds to open up the game (https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/nba-rules-changes-history.pdf)  Chris Paul is the same as D Wade.   I have multiple comments explaining how Manu Ginobilli’s flopping is one of the worst thing to happen to basketball and it’s why the Spurs were so hated in the early 2000s.   Reggie Miller was also pretty well-hated and i didn’t like reggie as a player then and i don’t like him now.   Laimbeer is one of the dirtiest players to ever play, what a great example    the fact of the matter is that in the era of the 80s to 2005, it was all about getting into the paint and attacking the rim. yes you had mid range jumpshots, but that’s when the drive or the post game didnt work. and they didn’t flop nearly as blatantly. they bitched about calls, but Marcus Smart is embarrassing the way he flops for how good of a player he is. same with LeBron. 100 times out 100 give me guys who drive into the lane and then try to beat some ass like Kermit Washington. watching Jimmy Butler roll around in pain laughing and tickling other players on the court feels like something out of Baseketball    watching guys shoot 36% from 3 isn’t fun.  they miss 60% of the time and i can get that at my local high school. NBA superstar Trae Young makes 42% of his shots. who in gods name wants to watch that? it’s just a free throw contest.   and missed jump shots are uber less exciting. what is more fun to watch: 6’6 220 pogo stick Desmond Mason miss a layup against 6’10 Chris Wilcox or Coby White and Jordan Clarkson trading pull-up 3 clanks?"
"Jamal Crawford was a better version of Jordan Clarkson and never got in an all-star game.  I think you could double the size of the all-star rosters and Clarkson still wouldn't make it in, which means you're stretching borderline way too far for me."
\+  JJ Redick 30/30  Jordan Clarkson 40/41  Seth Curry 33/34  Towns 26/27
And even when Jordan Clarkson finds a bad shot he takes it and makes it a lot of times
"Definitely Quin. 76ers are loaded and play weaker teams regularly. The Jazz are freaking nuts. Their third best player is either Jordan Clarkson, or Joe Ingles. Yet look at the record they're putting up."
"I think Utah has the best (Jordan Clarkson is ridiculous this season, Favors would start on many teams, and of course Jingles) but our bench is one of the better ones in the league"
"This is what turns a team into a true contender. You need your stars of  course but you also need the role players like Royce O'Neale, Jingles or Jordan Clarkson to play well. I really hope the Jazz can keep this up come playoffs."
"I mean, take Jordan Clarkson who hasn't been a starter in the league for years. I think calling him a borderline all-star is a real reach."
"The Jazz will pass until they find a good shot, then when they need a break Jordan Clarkson comes off the bench and dribbles until he finds a good shot and it's pretty much just as effective"

Can’t believe they forgot Jordan Clarkson like that smh.

"Hi.. Am from the Philippines. Basketball is quite popular here. Even bigger than football. Almost all villages here have basketball court and most Filipinos have a team or a player to root.

Got to love this team because of Dirk Nowitzki"
Jordan Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson.   Instant offense.
"What’s the coolest for me is how often Jordan Clarkson is happy for his teammates, there was a shot where he didn’t get an assist for a teammates three but he was still fucking pumped as he went back on defense. Like, what an awesome teammate.   I’ll ride for Clarkson forever after his time on the Jazz, he’s awesome."

"&gt;*There are  And this is just a very agreeable list.   Other main candidate for DPOY is Ben Simmons. But he just isn't as much of a presence on the entire team's defense.

Who's in the running apart from Jordan Clarkson
I thought it was Jordan Clarkson that was the 6MOTY favourite.
"Rather give COTY to Quinn Snyder. CP3 gets some credit as the Suns HC.  6MOY: Jordan Clarkson seems to be the more popular pick.  MIP: MPJ, yeah, yeah I know he's not going to win it because he's a soph but I believe a few sophs have won it in the past so who knows."

His value to the Jazz was being filler in the Jordan Clarkson trade.
"This, the problem with the warriors is the rotation not the top end talent.  Even against the jazz the top end talent matches up well.  Problem is when you get to the Jordan clarkson, bogdanovic, ingles, Conley warriors have…..Poole, JTA, bazemore and mulder.  If any one of these guys can get 20, warriors can win the game.  This is where it was suppose to be Wiggins, oubre, and wiseman but Wiggins had to move up due to the injury to Klay and the other 2 were meh this year and really didn’t produce to their contract/ draft position expectations."

I wonder how much Jordan Clarkson contributed to this.
I mean 4-out offense has been a thing for a few years now--Villanova launched it to fame.   Rudy just lets you do 4-out so effectively for the reasons you mentioned.   What really makes it work is having so many guys who can be dangerous from the 3. Even if we don't have a Steph or a Dame who are you going to leave open if you're making split second switching decisions? Jordan Clarkson is probably our worst regular 3pt shooter and he'll still lay a bunch on you if you let him.

Funny how people trying to ignore Jordan Clarkson for 6Moty and rather pick Ingles when Clarkson doing better for the last 15games. I don't ignore the fact that Ingles had a good advance stats the time when Clarkson was having a 1 bad month slump but for their past 20games he already recovered from the slump and had 22pts  55%fg 4.5rb 3.2ast in the last 10 games. I dont get why there so much hate for Clarkson for 6moty
I see him like our Jordan Clarkson. A bonafide scorer off the bench
If Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle didn't exist I think JP is in the talks. From being the statistically worse player to a potential 6moty type of guy if he can get his game up one more level.
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron’s effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie’s exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron’s people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA’s other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn’t pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
I Thought it would be Jordan Clarkson
"Poole is like Jordan Clarkson, a microwave scorer coming off the bench. Plus he's our backup PG for the 2nd unit. We stay alive in games now instead of just counting down the minutes until Curry comes back in because of JP  End of the day, it doesn't matter if Poole starts. It matters more if Poole close the game with Curry"
"Said this in another post, but Hanlen's client list is impressive - Barrett, Embiid, Tatum, Beal, Lavine, and Jordan Clarkson. All those dudes are having peak seasons right now. And one of the other trainers that works with him is currently MPJ's trainer."
Joe Caldwell  Joe Barry Carroll  Jack Coleman  Jason Caffey  Jose Calderon  Jim Caldwell  Jimmy Carruth  Jake Carter  Jevon Carter  Jay Carty  John Celestand  Jerry Chambers  John Chaney  Joe Chealey  Josh Childress  Jim Chones  Jordan Clarkson  Jim Cleamons  John Clemens  John Coker  Jason Collier  James Collins  Jarron Collins  Jason Collins  Jimmy Collins  John Collins  Joe Colone  Jeff Cook  Joe Cooke  Jack Cooley  Joe Cooper  Jack Cotton  James Cotton  John Coughran  Joe Courtney  John Cox  Johnny Cox  Jamal Crawford  Joe Crawford  Jordan Crawford  Jim Creighton  Joe Crispin  Javaris Crittenton  Jeffrey Crompton  Jeff Cross  John Crotty  Jae Crowder  Jared Cunningham  JamesOn Curry
Can someone check Jordan Clarkson? I feel he’s prob just under this mark.
"Funny enough, the Jazz had the fifth pick that year and drafted Dante Exum, who we traded to Cleveland for...Jordan Clarkson.  So we got a great guy out of the 2014 draft class, just in a really roundabout way."
"Klutch clients in the lakers currently:   LeBron, AD, KCP, Ben Mcklemore, Montrezl, THT.   Form the best klutch line up with the lakers.   P.S : ex Lakers klutch client: They could’ve had Jr Smith, Dion Waiters, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball as well."
He’s the Nuggets Jordan Clarkson.
He was. Looking demonstrably better this year! I could see him becoming a nice Jordan Clarkson-type player off the bench if he continues to develop
Have you ever seen Jordan Clarkson and Jordan Poole in the same room together?

The duality of Jordan Clarkson in effect this series
#JORDAN FUCKING CLARKSON
Looks like you're getting good Jordan Clarkson tonight Jazz fans.
Jordan Clarkson is like a basketball version of Russian Roulette
"The significance of Conley is for the Jazz offense, not the Jazz defense.   The Clippers defense has been modified to take advantage of the fact Donovan is the only player that can beat switches and get in to the paint. Every Don drive has been met with 4 Clippers collapsing on him, and every time he passes out of a double team, the Jazz player getting the pass either isn't fast enough to get in to the paint before the defense recovers, or it's Jordan Clarkson, and he makes questionable decisions with the ball once the remaining defenders get to him.  Conley can receive the ball off a double of Donovan and drive in, or at least make the right pass to take advantage of a recovering Clippers defense."
"I don't see the per-player net points on your link.  [NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=PLUS_MINUS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;TeamID=1610612762&amp;PORound=2&amp;PerMode=Totals) confirms your -2, though.  Really doesn't reflect well on Jordan Clarkson or Favors this series."
"He has a relatively team-friendly contract ([since it descends](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/larry-nance-jr-17855/)) and he's relatively old compared to the Cavs' young core (since he played 4 years in college), so he might end up getting traded within the next two years. Basically, he doesn't really fit the Cavs' rebuilding timeline.   If he does get traded, I could see him being a solid bench piece on a team trying to contend. He's obviously a very different player type than Jordan Clarkson, but I think that type of impact is possible. I could imagine Nance as a the 1st/2nd player off the bench for a team trying to win a title."
"""It's Jordan Clarkson time."" - Jordan Clarkson"
"Dude, you're talking out of your ass and not even reading what I wrote. I'm saying gobert is the only person on our team worth a damn on defense, I never once acted like he was crushing the clippers. I was showing that he is actually playing good D contrary to what all the fools on this subreddit meme about. Please show me where they are targeting him with pick n rolls because I would love to see that especially when we have jordan Clarkson out there for 40 minutes. yeah I'm sure they are gonna try and specifically attack rudy over Clarkson, Ingles, and mitchell."
When is Jordan Clarkson going to get more help?!
"People always say NBA players hit the genetic lottery and while it’s true there are levels, random people people like Trae Young, Jordan Clarkson, Seth Curry, Brook Lopez even are all really athletic but you can tell they’ve worked at their game and basketball skill is out of this world. Ben Simmons is the other spectrum, still relying on his size and speed and that’s it. If he was 6 foot 2 with this work ethic and skill he would’ve never sniffed the NBA"
"For sure, there are really talented guys who dont have any off hands at all (Jordan Clarkson, Westbrook) Ben simmons doesn't have a strong or an off hand"
"It was clear to anyone watching that their game didn't translate well to the playoffs: Jordan Clarkson, Donovan Mitchell's games were definitely not gonna be as effective come pressure time. Same with Gobert's spotless defense too.   And we're seeing exactly that right now."
Yup Jordan Clarkson and Jalen Green next season will be the Filipinos of the NBA
"Fortunately or unfortunately I must not get out enough because between work, family, and friends I never encounter these racist idiots in Utah.   I'm always so weirded out to hear about some dumb thing a racist has done here.   Also, Jordan Clarkson keeps adding to the reasons of why he is my favorite player right now!"
Jordan Clarkson is gonna get his shots up REGARDLESS
Rudy isn't like any other 7 footer. He's the best defender in basketball. You think Jordan Clarkson or Georges Niang could do a better job in that situation? The Jazz have won games trusting Gobert to defend in those scenarios before.
How did Jordan Clarkson take 6moty. This is ultimate 6Moty plays.
A team with Jordan Clarkson as their second best player is gonna probably be in the WCF. What a time.
"Holy shit, Quinn Snyder convinced Jordan Clarkson to play defense. How is this man not COTY?"
Yo wtf is Jordan Clarkson doing lol
Give me ten more Jordan clarkson 3s in this quarter
jordan clarkson might be might be my favorite nba player. how mad is jr smith that he never had the green light quite like this
Jordan Clarkson is pure fucking energy
Jesus Christ it’s Jordan Clarkson!
Jordan Clarkson is that the guy that dunked on LeBron and he had Nike delete the recording? Not sure if anyone remembers this but it was a WHILE ago I think in a pick up game or some shit
JORDAN CLARKSON. SAY HIS NAME
Let's play a drinking game. Take a shot everytime Jordan Clarkson passes.  Bet you'll be stone cold sober when the game ends.
"Jordan Clarkson is -13 so far. Jesus dude, you wore Kobe's jersey this morning."
They do...? Jordan clarkson!
its Jordan Clarkson time baby
Jordan Clarkson is a professional scorer.. love it
"Now I see why I never watched the Jazz much. The constant spamming of threes is kinda annoying, especially when they have jordan clarkson"
Its funny seeing best available and its a bunch of dudes you've never heard of and Jordan Clarkson
Michael Jordan Clarkson
"Jordan did it too. MJ created fake drama with players just to have that thirst for revenge be something he could fuel himself with. Clarkson is no MJ by any stretch of the means, but his comment tells me that he's going to give it his all in this series and I think it's important to have that kind of confidence in yourself and your teammates."
"Or the ""Since saying x Jordan Clarkson has set a new playoff high for bench scoring in every single game"""
"Hey, you can't take our thing Jordan Clarkson! /s"
That’s the kind of quote that shows up as a „Jordan Clarkson since saying xxx followed by shitty stats“ Reddit post two weeks later
Well if I had to guess I would think it's because Jordan Clarkson is a fan of Kobe.
"Well if anyone knows about player development its a Lakers fan. Look at how you guys developed Lonzo, BI, Hart, Randle, Jordan Clarkson even Larry Nance. At least Kyle Kuzma is still looking like a stud"
"Yeah said this back in February when they played matchup in general no bueno for Utah. Bet on LAC yesterday.   --Rudy Gobert not gonna be able to exploit and punish LAC for playing so much Morris at the 5.   --Utah is one wing defender shorter tbh for a Paul George/Kawhi lineup. Joe ingles is also 3 yrs older now than when he handled his son PG last time   --LAC switching alot is the type of thing that can neutralize alot of the actions Utah runs. Not the same type of motion offense you saw in the past but there is still some of that and in particular rely a ton on Gobert as a screener which teams have switched in the past to neutralize alot of their actions.   --- Too many defenders LAC will hunt and that's the type of thing they do. Kawhi was hunting Donovan when they played in the reg season. Bojan will get targeted. Jordan Clarkson definitely will also. Makes it easier for LAC   ---Like the article talks about Utah is built around taking away the rim, not something that really changes how LAC plays alot.   ---Solid LAC matchups across the board for Utah perimeter players. PG's length can get over the Conley pick and rolls make it harder for him to get off especially those floaters. Batum/Kawhi can do fine on Mitchell/Clarkson."
Jordan Clarkson won 6MOY
jordan clarkson is kobe 2.0 for sure
lol hes not a fraud  jordan clarkson gives you exactly what it says on the tin
We need another shot creator but i rather take my chances with some random dude and hope he becomes jordan clarkson.
its probably jordan clarkson but hes allowed to  hes got the 🟢🟢omega green light 🟢🟢
"Jordan Clarkson -may- force the clippers to play PG and Kawhi opposite each other to contain the Jazz bench play, which could be interesting for either side."
"I completely agree, but I just don't see what Kemba can give the Mavs. Brunson is a good playmaker and can drive to the basket. He shouldn't be their main scorer from the bench though. They could really use a Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson type player that can produce coming from the bench. I don't see Kemba as that player at this point in his career."
"Lmao way to make it sound like your narrative is the reason we lost. Definitely not because the other team was just better. Those teams didn't have Mike Conley, Bojan or Jordan Clarkson either."
"Yes, considering Joe Ingles just had one of the most efficient seasons of all time for a guard, and Jordan Clarkson averaged 18 ppg. Is that not scary to have coming off the bench?"
appreciate hope you make it out of ohio bud. hope sexton isn’t jordan clarkson lite
"Herro will never be as efficient as Harris, and Harris can't shoot off the dribble like Herro, he's strictly a catch and shoot player. I think a better comp for Herro's likely celing is Bogdan Bogdanovic or Jordan Clarkson."
Yeah I mean look at Jordan Clarkson lol
"Dude what? The Lakers were still 2 time defending champs. Would you have diminished the victory if Houston had beat the Warriors that last year where they went up 2-0? Just because injuries and fatigue were catching up they were still incredibly dominant before Durant and Klay went down. The same is true for that Lakers team.   As far as those thunder go, Durant was already at an MVP level. And harden was not just a role player, he was a microwave heat check guy ala Jordan Clarkson at that point.   And to top it all of he beat the already anointed Heatles."
"Kevin Love is still on the team with a massive contract, playing like trash and being a locker room cancer. LeBron ran Kyrie off, then bounced, every piece of the Kyrie trade was garbage. The 1st round pick from that trade got flipped into Jordan Clarkson and Nance Jr, Clarkson didn't play well in Cleveland. The whole Dwyane Wade in Cleveland bullshit LeBron forced. Demanding specific coaches, etc. The dude came in like a tornado, reorganized the entire team structure, won a championship, and then left everything in shambles and the team's still trying to recover without draft picks or really anything to show for it other than the single title.  The Cavs are having the problems they are because they couldn't develop talent while LeBron was there. He comes in, makes you trade away any existing assets you have so he can bring in his friends, and then leaves your team high and dry without any assets or young talent to recover.  Friendly reminder that LeBron got Tristan Thompson max contract money that he's *still* getting paid. If that doesn't prove to you just how bad he can fuck a team, I don't know what will."
Did he consider Jordan Clarkson a Laker? Seems JC has that Lakers Mentality playing for a better team.
"Lakers got rid of Jordan Clarkson, Brandon ingram, Julius randle, Josh hart. Kept Kyle kuzma"
Lmao you know we drafted Jordan clarkson and Julius randle right? Casual
"Quick reminder that this team had Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, and DeAngelo Russell and kept Kuzma 💀"
"he would only be good in a jordan clarkson role on a defensive team that need him to just shoot and even then he'd be pretty ass, he should be a bench player"
MPJ is the Jordan Clarkson of Kevin durants
"I mean we spent a lot of time trying to tell all yall that Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, D’Lo, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo were all great pieces to trade for but yall aint listen"
"So I live in the LA area and have never met someone who is a Clippers fan. There are people who like the Clippers and watch their games because they like basketball and like the chance to get another chance to watch other teams in the league, but the Lakers are always their number 1 team.  I have had conversations about the Clippers with other people at work and stuff, but I have never randomly walked past people talking about the Clippers, but would always come across people talking about Jordan Clarkson or Lonzo when we were in our baby Lakers phase which I mention because it was probably the era with the greatest peak for the pre-Kahwi Clippers and probably the all-time low era for the Lakers and yet even then  the Clippers couldn't crack casual conversation.  My theory on Clippers fans is that they are a mix of contrarians, Laker haters (these people typically root for the Lakers current rival and are only temporarily Clippers fans...they would have been Miami fans after Shaq left LA for example), people who live outside of LA and started following the NBA during the lob city era, and a specific type of upper middle class adult whose spouse bought Clippers season tickets (because they couldn't afford Lakers tickets) as a splurge and tags along to the games because they are ""fun"" but otherwise doesn't really follow basketball."
"I mean I prefer Trae Young stuntin the way he does versus Steph's meek stuntin mixed with humility.   But like... the fans? The fans are the fucking worst. ""Oh I hate the way he chews his mouth guard"".   Like what, are you literally 9 years old? That is the lamest fuckin attempt at haterade ever.   Trae doing his shit, bowing, talkin it up even more in the presser? That's legit.   Now... please... fans.. come up with some real shit. Don't come with your weak ass ""oh he balding"", ""oh he short"".   You disappointed haters everywhere with the mouthguard and shimmy hating. Come at Trae with some real haterade. Tell me about how he's one neck-bulge short of looking like a kid with muscular dystrophy.   Tell me that he's basically a short slightly less Filipino Jordan Clarkson with a greener light, and the only reason he's getting wins is because the East is trash. Get it trending on Twitter that he's the 30-day Free Trial of Steph Curry."
"Rudy Gobert won two DPOY awards and will win his third this year once it’s announced. Him, Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley all made the all-star team this year. Jordan Clarkson won 6th man of the year this year. Gobert and Mitchell are legit top tier players and now have multiple all star appearances. Mitchell has even won the dunk contest. Conley has been a great player for many years, but was always just barely pushed out of making the all star team. There are also some high level role players on the Jazz such as Bogdanovic and Ingles. In short, they have two (less famous due to small market) stars in Mitchell and Gobert matched with a deep roster filled great role players. I’m not exactly sure where I’d rank the two stars, but Gobert is probably the absolute best defensive presence in the league and Mitchell is a top 15 scorer."
"Little bit of both I’d say. Their best players are Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell, who are both all starts but more in the top 15-20 range. Their supporting cast is also excellent, they have the 6moy Jordan Clarkson as well as mike Conley, a borderline all star player"
I don’t think Lebron’s worried about Jordan Clarkson.
6th man of the year Jordan clarkson put some respect on it
Kuz channeling Jordan..... Clarkson
Jordan Clarkson and Swaggy P could never
"How many Lebron teams ran an offense that wasn't Lebron centric and without a proper system?  There's a reason a bunch of players played worse with Lebron and people just blame those players opposed to the utter lack of system. George Hill, Jordan Clarkson, Bosh, Love, Wade, Rose, Crowder, and the list goes on. That doesn't mean Lebron makes his teams worse, no he's Lebron and he's so great he will make the teams better. But the rest of these guys, without any sort of system, will be worse when he's off the court because the team doesn't run a system and there's a void in Lebron's ""role"" when he's off the court. There's no passing system to supplement his lack of presence because his teams don't develop one for the 10-15 minutes he's not playing. This is the overall issue, not that the players around him suck, but coaching isn't there for an offense that doesn't include Lebron."
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
Can you imagine if Ja shoots like Jordan Clarkson? That’s a top 10 player right there
Jordan Clarkson has the IQ of a 5-year-old. What a trash player. The Jazz need to have a big offseason with getting at least one good wing defender because players are constantly blowing by Ingles and the other dudes aren't very good either. Favors has played better on that end though.
Think he’s a step above Monte Morris money at 9m  Jordan clarkson money is pretty fair   Less than fvv  13-20m probably on the lesser side of that
And Jordan Clarkson is that bottle of Nitrous you hook up to the engine. Sometimes it supercharges our offense and sometimes it completely breaks it.
Best 210 player is Jordan Clarkson
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
"Eh. He’s a good scorer who soaks up a shit ton of usage, but he doesn’t distribute and he doesn’t play defense.   Which winning teams right now have their shooting guard as a pure scorer who doesn’t shoot the three at an elite rate and does nothing else well?  It’s an outdated role in today’s league. It’s not effective. He’s like a Jordan Clarkson before the Jazz took him and made him their bench scoring spark."
unless I wanted to bandwagon the Jordan Clarkson lakers I’m pretty sure I’m not a bandwagon. Still doesn’t change the pistons being bad tho. That’ll live forever.
"Cavs Clarkson - ""Hi I'm Jordan Clarkson and I have cable""   Jazz Clarkson - ""Hi I'm Jordan Clarkson and I have DirecTV"""

jordan clarkson made a 3? say what

"I’ve ran into a lot of players in Vegas during summer league. Not one bad experience except with Shabazz Napier. Was waiting for an elevator in my hotel and saw him standing there, all I said was what’s good Shabazz —no photo request, not being chatty or anything — and he gave me the dirtiest fucking look for absolutely no reason, scoffed loudly, and then turned around and left. Weird.   But the nicest guy I’ve ever met is Arron Afflalo by far. Marvin Bagley, Jordan Clarkson, Scott Brooks were super cool too."
Can't believe that was the same Jordan Clarkson that just won 6MOTY.
"Lets look at the timeline of events, shall we?  -	Cavs parts ways with David Griffin for….. some reason -	Interviews none other than Chauncey Billups for the GM job -	Kyrie forces his way off of the team. We get the corpse of IT, Jae Crowder and their first round pick (Colin Sexton) -	New GM Koby Autman starts a signing spree of random misfits: Derrick Rose and D. Wade (both on minimum contracts) -	LeBron calls Trump a bum on Twitter -	D. Rose steps away from the team mid season for personal reasons, considers retirement, had a weird report about him in a gym by himself -	Rose came back. Turned out he got married during his absence? -	Lue takes a leave of absence for health issues -	Cavs hold a team meeting. IT and Wade reportedly called out Kevin Love for leaving a game early due to an illness. Turned out that Love had a concussion -	Report comes out mid season that Kyrie threatened to get knee surgery if he wasn’t traded -	Love fractures a bone in his hand in mid January. -	An ESPN article “reveals” that LeBron may consider leaving the Cavs to join the….. Warriors? -	Feb 7: IT pleads the Cavs not to trade him. Says he is tired of being traded -	Feb 8: IT gets traded -	Cavs also trade Wade for basically free and sends Derrick Rose to Minnesota. In return, they received Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, LNJ -	JR smith throws a bowl of soup at Damon Jones -	TMZ revealed TT cheated on a Kardashian -	LeBronto sweeps the raptors -	JR Smith loses game 1 with one of the worst plays in NBA history. LeBron had a historic scoring night -	LeBron punches a white board, breaks his hand. Cavs lose the Finals  Yeah, I’d say that was definitely a weird team to say the least"
"The roster was actually pretty good on paper, problem is Jordan Clarkson decided to shoot 5% in the playoffs and the role players thought it was time to be completely useless lmfao"
Jordan Clarkson just won 6MOY for them 🤦🏽‍♂️
Donovan Mitchell is 100x more exciting than anybody on that squad. Maybe even Jordan Clarkson. Such a weird team lol
Jordan Clarkson for sure. Always does some wild shit
"This. Not to mention missing our second leading scorer for the entire series and Conley for a good portion of it.   Whatever. Let everyone sleep, for we are all Jingled on this blessed day. In the name of the Gobert, the Donovan, and the Mike Conley. Praise be Jordan Clarkson."
