"I just learnt of the 2020 draftee Xavier Tillman Sr. the other day. I know it's not uncommon to be a dad at a young age, but having a ""Sr."" on the back of a rookie's jersey is kinda nuts lol. He's just 22 apparently and he doesn't look like 22 at all."
He's Xavier Tillman Sr. for a reason

As an MSU alum and huge college bball fan... Memphis got a steal with Xavier Tillman Sr. &lt;3
Xavier Tillman **Sr.** sir.  Just your typical young-looking 22-year old rookie.
