"Khyri Thomas. Dark horse MIP candidate. I will never stop promoting Houston Rockets' Khyri Thomas. I'm not sure anyone other than Rockets' fans know who he is, and even then he's only played like 5 games for them outside the Summer League.  2019-20 season he played &lt;60 minutes for the Detroit Pistons, and was not good. 8 games, 2 points per game on &lt;30% shooting. Miserable.  Last season he came in on a 10-day contract to the Rockets who, on the morning of a game-day, had 6 uninjured, active, players on their roster. Khyri Thomas proceeded to ball the fuck out. A player who, playing in the final games of the season, didn't even have a picture for the broadcast to put up, went 16.5/3.6/5/1.8/1.2, on 58.6 TS% over the five games he got to play.  I don't know what happened, but even if we assume those were unusually good games, they were good games in *every facet*. He wasn't just hot, he was a SG pulling down offensive boards. He wasn't just being left open, his passing averaged 5 assists a game on 1.2 turnovers. It wasn't even just his offense - against Utah he had 5 steals and 2 blocks off the bench.  We need to talk more about Khyri Thomas."
"Where's Khyri Thomas, Houston? Play Khyri Thomas."
We don’t really have a point guard on the summer league roster (Khyri Thomas??)so he definitely stepped up big time
I don't know if John Wall makes the cut when I insist that Khyri Thomas and Jalen Green start.
Khyri Thomas the goat
"No joke he came in to the Rockets' on a 10-day last season for a game against the Bucks, because Houston's entire roster was injured. Watched this player they didn't even have a headshot for drop 16 points on 7 shots and mug players across the court. I am #1 Khyri Thomas fan."
Pistons legend khyri thomas
Khyri Thomas is a generational talent
"Want nice things for the Pistons, but also incapable of rooting against my guy Khyri Thomas. I'm stuck!"
"Okay, so:  2018: Sixers draft Khyri Thomas, traded to Pistons for two second rounders  One of those picks is sent to the Clippers as part of the package that gets Tobias Harris to the Sixers  Cippers trade that pick to us in the Marcus Morris trade"
Got the pistons pick from the clippers in the marcus morris trade. They got the pick from the 6ers in the tobias trade and the 6ers got it from the khyri thomas? Trade in 2018
"Assuming we take Green, our team is gonna be super entertaining this season. KPJ, Jalen Green, Jae'Sean Tate, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr, plus guys like Armoni Brooks and Khyri Thomas. That team might not make the playoffs, but they'll certainly play some entertaining basketball."
"Doug McDermott has carved out a really solid role in the league, Khyri Thomas just played himself into a guaranteed contract, and Ty-Shon Alexander shot 100% in the NBA Finals... just don't ask how many attempts. We won't get into Justin Patton either"
Who’s Khyri Thomas?
"I watched less nba last season than usual i have to admit, but who the fuck is khyri thomas?"
I'm sorry maybe I just haven't been paying attention but who tf is Khyri Thomas
1. Donovan Mitchell (1.3) - #27 in turnovers (2.8)  2. Jrue Holiday (1.3) — #50 in turnovers (2.2)  3. Khyri Thomas (1.2) — ? in turnovers (1.2) — only played 5 games  4. Jimmy Butler (1.2) — #51 in turnovers (2.1)  5. Russell Westbrook (1.2) — #1 in turnovers (4.8)  6. LaMelo Ball (1.2) — #25 in turnovers (2.8)
his PER was 15.  He was above replacement level- an average nba player his first year back from injury.  He was not remotely atrocious.  And they're only other PG is khyri thomas and DJ Augustin.  *They* are atrocious.
"Wall &gt; Drummond.  Griffin was injured- he played at least 15-20 games every year with Det, and played roughly 30min per game when he played. Houston is straight up saying before the season that they're going to bench him even if he's healthy.  Houston's other point guards: DJ Augustin and Khyri Thomas, who is not an actual prospect.  Seriously- they're going to bench John Wall for DJ Augustin??  That's offensive."
"Tacko Fall &gt; Khyri Thomas  There, I said it."
Bring back Khyri Thomas!
"**TLDR**: Shockingly enough the rebuilding Rox don't have an open spot for him b/c there are too many promising young guys, and entrenched starters + rotation players.  I know we're rebuilding and it feels like we should have an open sport for him, but we legitimately don't unless he wants to sign a 2-way(Bey and Lamb are the current ones but can be cut).  We're already down to 14 playable roster spots instead of 15 b/c of John Wall effectively being an assistant coach the entire year barring a miracle buyout or trade.   Plus we drafted 4 rookies in the 1st rd, 1 who's a guaranteed starter(Green), 1 who earned himself rotation minutes(Sengun) and 2 who look promising but are gonna be in RGV a lot(Christopher and Garuba). That leaves 10 roster spots to work with.  9 of those 10 roster spots are starters/rotation players on gtd contracts who aren't fighting for a roster spot: Gordon, CWood, Theis, Augustin, Nwaba, DHouse, KPJ, KMJ, and Tate.   Then we got 3 guys battling in training camp for the 14th spot: Exum who's on the weird incentive based contract built for trades, fan favorite sharpshooter Armoni Brooks who's on an Exhibit 10 but is prolly getting a 2 way spot, and Daishen Nix on an Exhibit 10 as well.  Including the two 2-way guys, that's 19 out of the 20 guys we had on our training camp roster since we cut Khyri Thomas, who was on a non-gtd contract, to do the Sekou trade.   In the grand scheme Sekou doesn't fit in that mix which is why he got waived. In spite of Sekou's theoretical potential, I just don't see a world where he makes the final 14 man roster over Exum w/his tradeable contract, or Armoni Brooks w/his elite shooting."
"This better be some roster slot sleight of hand, or someone better pick up Khyri Thomas I haven't been this excited about him for nothing."
"Khyri Thomas regular season box score from May 8, 2021:  27 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 5 steals, 2 blocks (48/33/100 shooting)"
"Came for Khyri Thomas, staying for Sengun, Jalen Green, Christian Wood, Garuba and KPJ."
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
Khyri Thomas was last year's league leader in overall RAPTOR and Mike Conley was 6th
"I mean they *are* 1-10 but even still. Last year's Rockets, the worst team in the league with a 17-55 record, ended with Khyri Thomas at +14 and Bruno Caboclo at 0. They played a total of 11 games *combined*. Anyone who played at least 30 games had at best a -28.  What's kinda crazy about that team is that Sterling Brown played 51 games and everyone else played 41 games or fewer."
"You could make nearly 10 NBA-viable teams out of that draft. Not necessarily in complete ranking order:  1. Trae, Luka, MPJ, JJJ, Ayton  2. SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Bagley, WCJ  3. Brunson, Trent Jr, Huerter, Miles Bridges, Robinson  4. Graham, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Brown Jr, Williams  5. Nunn, Robinson, Shamet, Vanderbilt, Bamba 6. Melton, Walker, Okogie, Tate, Wagner 7. Simons, Milton, Allen, Diallo, Alize Johnson 8. Holiday, Carter, Troy Brown Jr, Svi, Eubanks 9. McLaughlin, Chiozza, Kenrich Williams, Gary Clark, Metu 10. Trier, Bates-Diop, Hutchison, Khyri Thomas, Watanabe  The last few aren't amazing, but there's some decent role-players in them, which is pretty great value considering that's 50 players listed there."
I'm a fan of this result however I'm pretty sure Khyri Thomas isn't a top-50 player in the league.
1. Wood 2. KPJ 3. Tate 4. KJ Martin 5. Khyri Thomas 6. Armoni Brooks 7. Sterling Brown 8. Kelly Olynyk

"My man Khyri Thomas been balling and playing his heart out in Houston, even today when his shots weren’t falling the guy delivered 11 assists with a single turnover. As someone who expected him to be good back when Pistons drafted him in the second round this feels somewhat cathartic."
"3 firsts this year, currently projected to be high lottery, 23 and 24, but that high lottery could become late first if we don't get a top 4 pick.  A heap of future picks and swaps  Cap space  A young core of Wood, KPJ, KJ Martin and JaeSean Tate  And I feel we have some promising players in Khyri Thomas and Armoni Brooks  Honestly I think our future looks good all things considered, especially if we get a top 4 pick. We're in a good place to make some moves in a few years to acquire another all star, and we have a lot of chances to hopefully acquire some good young talent through the draft. I think the Rockets hate is overblown right now in this sub."
This khyri thomas guy looks and sounds like a created player but might be a good pickup
Fr no need to be this cruel.  Khyri Thomas tho 👀
"Our sub had some die hard Khyri Thomas supporters, Casey just never have him extended minutes. I liked Langston Galloway but we never allowed this man a real opportunity"
Khyri Thomas had 27 pts too; a career night.
"Khyri Thomas with 43 points in his first 2 games with the Rockets. It's probably not sustainable, but I hope he can carve out a decent career for himself in the league."
"lol I have unfortunately watched the whole ass game and im mystified why hes playing so passive... the Rockets tallest player is 6'6'' and we are currently running an 8 man roster of Anthony Lamb, Jeffries, KJ Martin, House, Khyri Thomas, Jae'Sean Tate, and Armoni Brooks. Y'all should be up 30 and Gobert should easily have a 20/20 game..."
"&gt;	3rd in the league in WS/48   That’s not even true? Do you have a source?  Bbalref doesn’t even include him as a qualifier for the stat, presumably because he hasn’t played enough.  They have these qualifiers because it can otherwise cause crazy outliers like Gary Payton II being second in the league in ws/48, and **Khyri Thomas being first**  You’re basically proving my point lol"
Khyri Thomas is not a real person
Play Khyri Thomas more you cowards.
In eight years someone's gonna make one of these about Khyri Thomas and I better be in the aged well section.
One of my favourite bits about watching other teams is learning random bench players I never heard of. I became a fan of the Rocket's Khyri Thomas that way
"Stone honestly seems like he has a good eye for talent. In a redraft KMJ might would go mid 1st round, and Tate was a great find too. And some of the random G-league signings weren't bad either, I have a lot of hope for Khyri Thomas and Armoni Brooks"
"Formatting iasues haha. Some of those opinions i have at the first look are crazy. But when it is looked deeper, all of them  after this season look realistic - Houston showed they have good team potential. Kenyon is good, Tate is good Khyri Thomas can be x factor, Kevin Porter Jr will surely be elite, every one forgots about Eric Gordon, it only takes Kevin Porter Jr improvments in consistency and drafting right guy (Mobley) to turn the things up. Their struggles comes from inexpirience and from the fact Wood is not True defensive anchor ( why i wish  they draft Mobley). About Ntilikina he shot 47% from the three while being good defender-he can be shorter shooting guard, because of insane wingspan but Thibs is afraid or what ever. Gobert there is no need to explain yes he was in the paint but it is not center role to run and contest corner three pointers in drop schemes, it should be wing roles. About Mikal Bridges, he had in the regular season pull up midranges and it looked okay-his ball handling improvments are real and i am sure suns will work on his pull up shot to become a threat so opponent  will have harder time to guard him. Toronto has high draft pick, their development is nice, they arent bad team but injuries and no home court ruined them. While Lowry is year older, there is always a possibility someone of the raptors bench mob players has a break out. And honestly about break outs, i expect Og Anunoby break out, while Chris Boucher, even though not so young can still get some weight and become even better defender. Michael Porter JR had a hard time in the playoffs(was guarded by only consistent defender on the Portland trail blazers, Covington, and also good suns wing defense) but Michael Porter Jr in the regular season was hitting  pretty wild shots without hesitation, and has shown he can be good pull up shooter. He will work on quickness and counter moves and it will make him into next Kd. Poetl showed improvments in pnr defense. He is ok on switch but struggles come in the moment when he need to choose coverage - he gets stuck. It will change though. Dejounte gaining weight and strenght will also help because spurs pnr defense is  affected by  Dejounte struggles at fighting trough screens. ."
"Mikal Bridges can develop all three levels of scoring - spot up, pull up and at the rim, in a really short time : my opinion it will happen in next two seasons. And another: Poetl will become better at defending in space and become dpoy level impact defender (already elite rim protector, but struggle in defending space aka pnr) And another one: Ntilikina is nba  level player and he should play as shooting guard #FREENTILIKINA Michael Porter Junior will be next Kevin Durant Houston will be contenders(i hope they draft Mobley) nex season, Kenyon Martin Jr will be in the race for Most improved player and Khyri Thomas is nba level player his defense is insane. Utah need better defenders to be the true contenders- Gobert cant hold whole defense on his own and Utah failure is not his fault Raptors will be back stronger than ever and B mis season be title favorites"
