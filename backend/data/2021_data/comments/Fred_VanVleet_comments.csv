"Historic performance for Fred VanVleet.  54 pts by being hyper-efficient and allowing the Raptors to win.  I also note the 3 blocks which must be a career record for him as well. Add to that 3 interceptions, and you have the MVP of the night."
He‚Äôs no Fred VanVleet though
"well, after tonight i would say fred vanvleet. he is lethal, and he has been an allstar this year."

"Yep, Fred VanVleet just casually dropped the most efficient 50-point game ever (100.1% true shooting!!)"
54 points from Fred VanVleet. Wow.

"Fred VanVleet, all star"
"Fred ""Steph Curry"" Vanvleet vs Evan "" Kobe Bryant"" Fournier"
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."

Fred Vanvleet benefitted alot from the gleague too.
"I think the top 5 playing now are: Rudy Gobert, CJ Mccollum, Hassan Whiteside, Danny Green, and Fred VanVleet"

Fred VanVleet get off your feet!
"I tried using the Raptor metric and I got OG  Anunoby, Aron Baynes, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Fred VanVleet  Maybe I‚Äôm doing something wrong."
"I‚Äôm going to be Perfectly honest with you . Pascal Siakim isn‚Äôt a second option while a good player in his own right ,he can‚Äôt be the man of this franchise . Second , Fred VanVleet is an okay shooting guard or an all-star level shooting guard  , let‚Äôs be honest he‚Äôs a all star at this point , but won‚Äôt carry team to the finals via physical limitation, he‚Äôs too short . OG is the one guy with the most upside so he‚Äôs a player U want to bet on in the playoffs  . Moreover , why I‚Äôm assessing these players , I believe Toronto needs to make a trade and if the FO isn‚Äôt willing to trade pascal and FVV to a player a la Christian wood or KAT than I demand them to resign from their post . Yes , I love FVV and Pascal however if you want to go the finals or playoffs you need to trade for that guy . If you can‚Äôt proceed to the draft we‚Äôre you belong until you found that franchise altering player ."

Fred Vanvleet ending with 3-17. Yiiiiiiikes
"&gt;Lol the guy was a shit shooter in college and now he's a dreadful shooter in the NBA. He's not a good passer or playmaker, either. Literally the only thing he's good at is dunking. He'll probably shore up his rim finishing but right now, he's at a horrific 51.6%, which is Fred VanVleet-esque (only VanVleet is 5'11 instead of 6'4).  &gt;The guy is Andrew Wiggins 2.0 but an even worse shooter.   But that doesn't tell me you've watched him either since you are only quoting stats at me.  His finishing at the rim is dreadful atm is because he either does put up a bad shot or he gets hacked and the refs don't call it."

https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/giant-slayer-how-raptors-fred-vanvleet-reaches-great-heights-on-defense/  Theres a youtube clip in there of him guarding Curry.  No one is helping.    It is from the finals a minute and a half long
"He is never out of position defensively, really never.   If you try to drive and he is the help defender his hands are incredible.  He is able to make guys pick up a dribble and yet recover unlike anyone his size ever because his timing is impeccable.  He is a genius.     https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/giant-slayer-how-raptors-fred-vanvleet-reaches-great-heights-on-defense/"
"&gt;What you're describing is not a free society and is not analogous at all to what is being described. According to you, Kyrie doesn't have the freedom to choose where to work, where to live, and how much to get paid.  NBA rookies do not have this freedom **if they want to stay in their industry** because of the draft.  They don't have this freedom until they become unrestricted free agents. I'm not arguing against contracts or Kyrie deciding to go to toronto or play for another team suddenly.  I'm talking about the draft.  &gt;That does NOT mean that you have the right to work whereever you please, under whatever rules you wish to follow. You may negotiate, but at the end of the day, the other party, being a private entity, also has the right to select who they wish to engage in contract with.  What you are talking about here are contracts.  I'm talking about the draft.  &gt;the Fred VanVleet route  I don't know why you even bring him up because it has nothing to do with the draft because VanVleet **wasn't drafted.** If he had gone say as a late second rounder to some team he didn't want to play for he could no have gone on to directly try out for a team and then negotiated a contract with them.  If say the TWolves had drafted him and he didn't like the contract or city he was offered, he would not have been able to enter into negotiations with any other 'company' ie team in the NBA for a year.  They would have had the exclusive rights to him.  &gt;Like it or not, this IS how a free society works. No one is obligated to give you anything for free. If youre getting paid money, you get to decide what you want to give up for it, and how much you're willing to do it for. That's all there is.  The draft is not at all a free society or free market mechanism.  I don't even know why you're arguing this, there's so much academic and legal literature on the various anti-trust exemptions the sports leagues get and how they get to operate in a specially created non-free market way, both in deciding local monopolies through creating franchises and in hiring practices.  The very first paragraph of this[ paper](https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1321&amp;context=mslj) takes as a given that:  &gt;Professional sports are built around competition, but the industry would not exist without collusion.1 Sport does not produce anything tangible to be imported and exported; yet, it is a substantial business presence. Because of its economic impact, both the United States (‚ÄúUS‚Äù) and the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù) have had to reconcile their antitrust laws with sport‚Äôs commercial collusion. This article examines the special treatment sport receives under the antitrust laws in the US and the EU and the possibility that a de facto sporting exemption still exists in both jurisdictions.  In the basketball labor market the 30 NBA teams act collectively to create a monopsony on basketball players.  That's just inarguable fact, you literally cannot argue they do that because that' s, by definition, what the draft is.  You can argue whether that's necessary, or worthwhile.  But you can't argue that it's some free market mechanism and is a function of free society or a free market.  &gt;Hobbes  No just no, nothing about how professional sports leagues work in the US between the various teams is Hobbesian competition at all."
"Absolutely not. In a free and liberal society you have the freedom to choose where, when, to whom, and for what price you relinquish certain rights for (that is what a contract is - an exchange of rights). In this case, Kyrie is free to walk away from all of the obligations that he voluntarily imposed upon himself - by also forgoing the million dollar paycheque that was the price for buying that forbearance. After all, you have the right to choose whether or not you engage into any contract - that is what freedom of contract is.  That does NOT mean that you have the right to work whereever you please, under whatever rules you wish to follow. You may negotiate, but at the end of the day, the other party, being a private entity, also has the right to select who they wish to engage in contract with.  What you're describing is not a free society and is not analogous at all to what is being described. According to you, Kyrie doesn't have the freedom to choose where to work, where to live, and how much to get paid. But he does. He can quit his job, he can move whereever he wants, and he can choose to take a job paying any salary he wants, IF someone is willing to offer him the money. It so happens that the only entity willing to offer him the money he's looking for is the NBA, and in exchange, they ask him to follow their rules. He has the freedom to decide what price is worth it to forgo certain rights and freedoms he has. He does NOT have the right to get the money AND have 0 obligations. A contract will always have terms. That is what our society is built upon. Go read Hobbes for a start.  Currently, he has voluntarily relinquished certain rights he has in exchange for something of value (money).  To get to the point of the draft:  Regardless of anything I said above, if you dont like the way the draft turns out for you, you can opt out of the draft and go the Fred VanVleet route by trying out for a team directly and hoping they offer you a contract. However, most people would gladly choose to forgo that freedom in exchange for job security and guaranteed money. That's how a contract works. You exchange something of value for something else of value. In this case, you forgo the right to choose which team you're playing for in exchange for guaranteed contracts and more money. If you don't get drafted, you can try out for whatever team you want.  Like it or not, this IS how a free society works. No one is obligated to give you anything for free. If youre getting paid money, you get to decide what you want to give up for it, and how much you're willing to do it for. That's all there is."
Fred vanvleet
"This post confirms that Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and Malachi Flynn will all win MVP's"
This is what happens if you sign Fred VanVleet for 4 years $85m.
Why has Fred vanvleet only taken two shots?
"I'm 6'4"" without shoes. That means I am taller than...  - Steph Curry - Kyrie Irving - Russell Westbrook - Donovan Mitchell - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Kyle Lowry - Fred VanVleet  ... among others, and three inches or less shorter than:  - Kawhi Leonard - Jimmy Butler - DeMar DeRozan - Zach LaVine - OG Anunoby - Draymond Green  - Klay Thompson  ... yet I am the complete opposite of an athlete lol"
"We just dont have enough guys that can play winning basketball and those that can, have started slow. Like this is our Championship rotation players:  Kyle Lowry - Still plays at a high level  Danny Green - Went to LA  Kawhi Leonard - Went to LA  Pascal Siakam - Plays at a high level. Had a slow start and has picked it back up, but his regression is completely exaggerated because of the bubble.   Marc Gasol - Went to LA  Fred VanVleet - Still plays at a high level but is sometimes inconsistent in scoring due to his size.  Norman Powell - Has looked like a shell of himself so far and his BBIQ looks like GoDaddy curse Norm from [year 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/powelno01.html).  OG Anunoby - His defense is good, but his shot has been off so far. We were hoping he would take a leap in the scoring department after the bubble, but he still can't create buckets for himself.  Serge Ibaka - Went to LA  So last season, we lost Kawhi and Danny but we were still able to compete at a high level because we had 7 solid players. Our depth wasnt the best which is why Nurse would heavily rely on the likes of our 7 Championship vets. [Look at the MPG for the playoffs last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html)  While we played well, our two biggest weaknesses were rebounding and halfcourt offense, none of which were addressed in the offseason.  We also lost Gasol and Ibaka, who while looked like they were past their primes, provided solid defense at the rim and good offense. Marc couldnt score, but his passing was phenomenal, and Ibaka was able to get buckets consistently from midrange and 3. They both also brought a veteran poise and IQ to the team.  They were replaced with Alex Len and Aron Baynes. Baynes has struggling on offense, he cant even make open layups, and Alex Len, is a bonafide scrub.  So our bench mob became our starters and our bench is thin and full of gleaguers. Terrence Davis hasnt played much and is struggling a bit. Boucher has been great but he lack size.  So were a small team and a lot of our talent has been stripped. Our key vets have had some off games early and that can be attributed to getting adjusted with a new team as well as offcourt things like having to be in Tampa and essentially every game being a road one."
I feel like Vanvleet is one of the best defenders in the league in terms of guarding Curry although I'm probably biased.  The Fred/Lowry combo must be a nightmare for him.

"100%.  This smells of 2016. Apparently, people at the time thought it was a ""weak"" class, but it ended up producing some amazing starter-caliber players. Siakam, Brogdon, Simmons, Murray (Jamal and Dejonte both), Sabonis, Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Hield, LeVert, Zubac, and so on. Heck, Fred VanVleet and Dorian Finney-Smith were *undrafted* that year."
"A 3 and D guy usually has a pretty small, but important role on offence (spacing the floor with shooting). Fred does a lot more than that, and he usually has the responsibility to create shots for not only himself, but for others as well.  They're also usually wing players who can swap between the 2 and 3; VanVleet is more of a combo guard."

"Can someone explain how Tony Parker was developed so well through Pop and the Spurs organization?  I always see these tidbits on Tony and Ginobli. Came in as really rough players. I'm so used to an NBA environment where everyone just gets traded or goes under the radar if they're really average like that. What is a modern player you could compare young Tony Parker or Ginobli to?  It's just crazy cause when I started watching NBA in 2013 they were established great players already, and then I hear stories of them fucking up a bunch in the mid 2000s and it's just crazy that the Spurs stuck with them and developed them for YEARS without everything splitting apart. That's like Lebron staying on the heat and Mario Chalmers developing into a stud after years of development. I feel like all those role players get traded so often now that it's hard to see an average player turn into a star (somewhat) over a decade on the same team.   Not like Tatum or Brown who are already stars in their early years, but someone like Fred VanVleet(?) who is developing on the Raptors."
I hope you realize that Fred Vanvleet is shooting a better 2 pt  percentage
"Before the draft I saw people saying Fred VanVleet is the comparison and ceiling. I think that‚Äôs pretty accurate, if a tad ambitious. But at the same time I don‚Äôt see why not - similar size and shooting percentages, four year college players, PP was a bit more productive in college despite being surrounded by better players.   His ceiling will always be limited by being 6‚Äô1‚Äù and without elite athleticism. Everyone says he‚Äôs the hardest worker they‚Äôve ever seen, been reading about that since he was in high school. As an Oregon fan I can compare him to a few similar sized PGs: Aaron Brooks and Luke Ridnour. Both of those guys were playing into their mid 30s, and had nice careers. PP was better than them in college.   As for team achievements, not a lot of NBA starters stayed in college long enough to win three conference championships.

Fred VanVleet should be here
I‚Äôm willing Fred VanVleet DPOY into existence
I think in Doc‚Äôs case he was hoping his 6th man of the year would snap out of the slump he was in and pick up his game. I always think back to Fred VanVleet in the 2019 playoffs. Guy couldn‚Äôt hit a shot to save his life in the first 2 rounds and 95% of the fan base was screaming for his head and to replace him with Jeremy Lin. Nurse sticks with him and he goes off against the Bucks and the Warriors and the Raptors are the champions. If sticking with your guy works you look like a loyal genius. If it doesn‚Äôt work at least you look loyal. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs also hard for a coach to bench an underperforming player who has consistently outperformed the guy everyone wants to play (at least for the season and probably in practice all year too)
"add in the details part too. the 2nd pick is protected and likely just 2nds but this is pretty realistic imo   The details: In an Eastern Conference race that is wide open, the 76ers could desperately use another dynamic two-way player. Bringing Lowry, a North Philadelphia native, back home could be the difference-making move that results in the 76ers' return to the NBA Finals for the first time in 20 years.  Yes, Lowry, a pending free agent, is going to turn 35 the day of the NBA trade deadline. And yes, giving up multiple first-round picks and a young player in Maxey would be difficult.  But it's a move Philadelphia should make. The 76ers add a proven playoff performer who would give coach Doc Rivers flexibility in how he deploys Ben Simmons. With Lowry's Bird rights, the Sixers could either extend him before the season ends or re-sign him this summer.  For other contenders, like the LA Clippers, the difficulty in trading for Lowry comes with both making the cap math work (Lowry makes $30.5 million this season) and giving Toronto something it needs in return. This trade accomplishes both.  Maxey and the picks will help Toronto add to its core of Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby moving forward. Green, Scott and Ferguson all have expiring deals that can be rerouted to Cleveland so the Raptors can add Drummond, shoring up their center position without taking on long-term money.  The Cavaliers would recoup the second-round pick they gave up to acquire Drummond last season.  -- Tim Bontemps"
"Why would Dolan overpay guys who suck? LeBron James agent calls him, ""Hey, LeBron wants a $100 million contract.""  Do you really think Dolan would reply, ""Sorry, I'd rather spend $100 million on Fred VanVleet.""  Management with a salary cap requires brains and creativity. If you could throw as much money at players as you want, you can be a monkey and win."
Wow soft. My non-allstar Fred Vanvleet would have windmilled that shit
"none of this changes the fact that Lin looked confused, disoriented and overwhelmed trying to run the Raptors offense.  Bottom line is, Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry are much smarter point guards than Lin.    I don't care how many years Lin spent in Harvard.  Lowry and VanVleet are much smarter.  Mr. Lin, please enjoy your time in the G-League getting roasted by such elite floor generals as Malachi Flynn."
"The whole ‚ÄúLonzo pushes the ball well‚Äù has got to be one of the most overstated skills of any player in the league since Kevin Love‚Äôs outlet passes. It‚Äôs like everyone wants to talk themselves into Lonzo being better than he is. His D is above average, but not great, his three is (currently) above average but not consistently good.   He‚Äôs a solid player. A rich man‚Äôs Delon Wright. A poor man‚Äôs Fred VanVleet."

I love how they call him Fred unlike the rest of the leagues commentators who calls him by vanvleet
It kinda sucks that people are still looking at steals and blocks to judge defence. Fred VanVleet is a great defender regardless of how many steals he racks up. He's 5'11 but is still really good because he puts in a ton of effort
Did the Bucks make a mistake trading the barn for Jrue over Fred VanVleet?
"He literally got a Finals MVP vote because of his defense on Steph Curry. He leads the league in deflections. And would lead in steals if he didn't keep getting his steals counted as blocks. Even then,  &gt;""Fred VanVleet is currently averaging more blocks per game than anyone in the history of the NBA listed at [6'2] or shorter.""  He is an elite on-ball defender *against guards*  and is a near elite help defender at the basket. Just look at his recent steals against Embiid, Giannis, SImmons. Dude is pantsing these guys in the post.   https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-fred-vanvleet-shot-blocker-stats  People downplaying FVVs defense have no credibility."

"lot of the attention is gonna be given to Lukas shot obviously, but Brunson was huge this game and has been our most consistent player after Luka. Carlisle has given him lots of praise for his development. Reminds me a lot of Fred Vanvleet. just a solid backup point guard. He sparked that run we had and we could have closed the game out when we were up 104 93 , and in the bonus too, but closing out games has been a problem since last year, also Kemba had that 4 pt play to spark the Boston run. good thing we had Luka to bail us out again."
Fred VanVleet has some of the best hands in the game
"Fred Vanvleet, or anyone of the Raptors top3 (Fred, Lowry, or Siakam) probably deserved a spot."
"You also just described Fred Vanvleet, but instead of best scorer, Raps are missing their best playmaker."
where's Fred Vanvleet?
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I‚Äôd have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.

"Makes sense. Obviously I also wanna see Steph there, but I'd love to see guys like Seth Curry, Fred VanVleet, Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, etc."
"Even ignoring the other players, you are trading the better yardie for a worse yardie. Just waiting for a big to come onto the buyout market would be better than trading Powell for Drummond. Reaching out to Dedmon to see if he wants to sign for the rest of season is better than trading a better player for a worse player who plays another position. When Drummond is shooting at the third worst percentage in the league at the rim (minimum 100 attempts) only ahead of Fred VanVleet and Malcolm Brogdon, he is still a bad defender and teams rebound better when he is on the bench, why would I want to trade a positive player like Norman for a negative player. Keeping Norman and just riding with Baynes, playing more OG at C or running more Yuta+Boucher together is far better than trading Norman for a player whose value was SO LOW just last season that they got traded for Brandon Knight John Henson and one 2nd round pick."
"It's 538's new all-in-one stat. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  It spits out some weird shit, like Fred VanVleet #5, Mike Conley #6, Jakob Poetl #14, , Nicolas Batum #15 etc., but it's interesting to have another stat that prioritizes different things than the other more traditional advanced metrics. From what I can tell, it looks like it favours defensive big men with good on/off numbers, and penalizes bad defense players more heavily than other metrics."
Fred Vanvleet and Brogdon
"Do you believe that was the only change we made?   - We got Marc Gasol  - Siakam became an all star / borderline all star caliber player   - Serge improved significantly  - We got a championship 3&amp;D starter in Danny Green  - Fred VanVleet was a lot better in the last 2 series  - We got a new head coach that understood positional matchups   In 2018 our offensive rating against Cleveland was fine. The issue was defensively, we had JV guarding Love, Serge Ibaka on JR Smith and DeMar (a guy who infamously couldn't get around a screen to save his life) guarding Kyle Korver. There's a reason those 3 shot 40%+ in that series and did shit all offensively  In the other series .  If Exchanging Kawhi for DeRozan was truly the only change we made, we lose to Philly 100%"
‚ÄúKeep shooting your shot.‚Äù - Fred ‚ÄúConfucius‚Äù VanVleet  Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day everyone!
"Start Mikal, Bench OG, Cut Bojan  Start Middleton, Bench Lavine cut Fred Vanvleet  Start Haliburton, Bench Gary Trent Jr, Cut Lonzo  Start KCP, Bench Kuzma, Cut Melo  Start Dame, Bench CP3 cut Kyrie"
Fred Vanvleet can shutdown Stephen Curry
"All,kinds of heart.  His high school team was ridiculous.  They had Javon Carter and Paris Lee (MVC player of the year a few years ago). They pressed after missed baskets.   Paris Lee averaged 6 steals a game.   Carter wasn‚Äôt far behind.   They played Jabari, Kendrick Nunn, kendall Pollard (dayton top 25 team best player) and Tate (illinois starting point guard), and some other D1 player that is slipping my mind.  Came down to the buzzer between to undefeated teams.   Proviso had beaten Fred vanVleets team in the semis by 10.   VanVleet was the tallest player on his team.  Probably my favorite two days of basketball as a spectator in my life."
"Danny green, Fred VanVleet and Normal Powell?"
"So he didn't have 2 all-stars with him.   The Warriors and maybe the Rockets bounce the Cavs sure. But it would take a 60 win type top West team. Indiana was good that year they are basically the Jazz West. Oladipo, Myles Turner, Sabonis, Bogdanovic etc good team all around shooting and defense.  Toronto was a 59 win team they had a better record than the Warriors that year they were excellent. They were the favorites to win the series. They had Valunchunis and Ibaka and Fred Vanvleet.  Boston was better without Kyrie. They had a better record without him playing and they were a better defensive team without him. Boston was led by the all-star/all-defense Al Horford. Tatum balled out his age doesn't mean anything. The Cavs were led by a 34 year old Lebron James.  That Boston team wouldn't get swept by anyone. '19 year old Tatum' beat Giannis and Embid before running into Lebron. Boston had the #2 ranked defense in the entire league."

"I think it means the exact opposite. Nick was tossed for sticking up for Fred VanVleet after he took a pretty hard knock from JV.   The Raptors were having a bad game but I think seeing their coach continuing to fight for them and believe in them on every possession, they rallied and starting playing the way Nick would want them to play.  I think it means they came together as a unit and got their coach the win."
Fred Vanvleet the ALL STAR
"You oughta check out [this](https://youtu.be/diklDy3-aaM) video of a bottom of the bench, garbage minutes only Fred VanVleet giving a college standout/gleaguer and top recruit (now in the MBA) players the absolute business 1v1. FVV isn‚Äôt even considered a great defender and he just crushes them on both sides. Yes full court is a different game, but it‚Äôs so easy to underestimate just how good being in the NBA necessitates.  A great scrub once said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm closer to LeBron than you are to me‚Äù. That will never stop being true"
"U.S.-China tensions, human rights and business are once again meeting uncomfortably on the basketball court.  In China, local brands are prospering from a consumer backlash against Nike, H&amp;M and other foreign brands over their refusal to use Chinese cotton made by forced labor. Chinese brands have publicly embraced the cotton from the Xinjiang region, leading to big sales to patriotic shoppers and praise from the Beijing-controlled media.  In the United States, two of those same Chinese brands, Li-Ning and Anta, adorn the feet of N.B.A. players ‚Äî and those players are being rewarded handsomely for it. Two players reached endorsement deals with Anta in February. Another signed on this week. Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors already had a shoe deal with Anta that has been widely reported to be valued at up to $80 million.  Dwyane Wade, the three-time N.B.A. champion and retired Miami Heat player, has a clothing line with Li-Ning that is so successful he has recruited young players for the brand.  Like the foreign brands in China, the league and its players could soon feel themselves squeezed between Washington and Beijing. Western companies are being pressured by American officials and lawmakers to respond to accusations of genocide in Xinjiang. But they face a consumer-driven backlash in China, where celebrities have severed ties with brands like Burberry and patriotic citizens have burned their Nike shoes on social media.  The N.B.A. and its athletes are familiar with the challenges of trying to stand up to China and maintain access to its nearly 1.4 billion consumers. Just two years ago, China exiled the N.B.A. from state media channels after the general manager of the Houston Rockets supported pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  The league has so far avoided the latest round of controversy. That may not last for long.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine celebrities and brand ambassadors being able to walk this line between those negative views of China in their home countries and the increasingly clear demands in China to publicly demonstrate the use of products made in Xinjiang,‚Äù said Natasha Hassam, director of the Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.   The Chinese companies themselves are unlikely to take a significant hit. The United States banned imports of products made from Xinjiang cotton in January, but neither Li-Ning nor Anta sells large numbers of shoes there. (They are available online, however.) Still, their full-throated support of Xinjiang could have reputational consequences for the American athletes.  ‚ÄúIt is a simpler proposition for a Chinese celebrity to say I‚Äôm going to end my ties with X European company and probably be rewarded domestically for it,‚Äù Ms. Hassam said. ‚ÄúAmericans looking to profit off China‚Äôs market find themselves in a much more challenging place.‚Äù       After Li-Ning and Anta published positive statements on Xinjiang cotton last week, investors in China sent the share price of both companies soaring. Chinese state media was quick to fuel the show of patriotism. At one point, a pair of Li-Ning shoes under Mr. Wade‚Äôs Way of Wade line traded for nearly $7,500.  But the statements could invite regulatory scrutiny on future business operations in the United States, said Brian J. Fleming, a lawyer specializing in sanctions at Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered.  ‚ÄúBy speaking out, Anta and Li Ning are simultaneously supporting the Chinese government and thumbing their noses at U.S. restrictions, which is a combination unlikely to be greeted warmly by U.S. authorities,‚Äù Mr. Fleming said.  Anta and Li-Ning did not respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Thompson, one of the N.B.A.‚Äôs biggest stars, is known as ‚ÄúChina Klay‚Äù to his Chinese fans and once said he wanted to be the Michael Jordan of Anta. His teammate James Wiseman, as well as Alex Caruso of the Los Angeles Lakers, signed with Anta earlier this year, according to the sportswear brand‚Äôs social media account. Precious Achiuwa of the Heat announced this week that he was joining Anta.  Requests for comment from Mr. Thompson and other N.B.A. players also went unanswered.  Outside China, Xinjiang has become synonymous with repression. Reports suggest as many as one million Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities have been held in detention camps. In March, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused China of continuing to ‚Äúcommit genocide and crimes against humanity‚Äù in the far northwestern region.  The N.B.A. has powerful reasons to keep quiet on China. When Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, voiced his support for the Hong Kong protests on Twitter in 2019, Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center paused their partnerships with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, whose president is the former Rockets player Yao Ming, also suspended its cooperation with the Rockets.  Mr. Morey deleted the message.  Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, later said that the Chinese government had asked the league to fire Mr. Morey, a claim that the Chinese Foreign Ministry quickly denied. But the incident left a scar on the N.B.A.‚Äôs reputation for supporting free speech and severely limited its access to the Chinese market.  China Central Television, the state-run television network, stopped broadcasting N.B.A. games after Mr. Morey‚Äôs message on Twitter. Late last year, it briefly resumed coverage for Games 5 and 6 of the N.B.A. finals. A week later, Mr. Morey stepped down as general manager.  In a radio interview this week, Mr. Silver said that CCTV had stopped airing N.B.A. games again, but that fans could stream them through Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate. He said that the N.B.A.‚Äôs partnership with China was ‚Äúcomplicated,‚Äù but that ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt speak up about what we see are, you know, things in China that are inconsistent with our values.‚Äù  A spokesman for the league declined to comment for this article.   Money and a large China fan base are at stake for players like Mr. Thompson and the dozens of other American athletes who have been heavily promoted by Anta and Li-Ning. Mr. Thompson has had a partnership with Anta since 2014 that has given him a popular shoe line and sponsored tours in China.  More recent deals between the companies and N.B.A. players could face questions in coming weeks as tensions between the United States and China escalate. Jimmy Butler, a five-time all-star who plays for the Heat, and the Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet signed on with Li-Ning in November. Mr. Wade, the retired Heat player, helped CJ McCollum and D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, two star guards, secure deals with Li-Ning through his sportswear line.  ‚ÄúMy decision 7 years ago to sign with Li-Ning was to show the next generation that it‚Äôs not just one way of doing things,‚Äù Mr. Wade wrote on Twitter when he announced Mr. Russell‚Äôs contract in November 2019. ‚ÄúI had a chance to build a Global platform that gives future athletes a canvas to create and be expressive.‚Äù"
Fred VanVleet? Ben Simmons?
Somehow I just now realized his name is Fred VanVleet and not Fred VanFleet. :o
"Fred ""plenny money"" VanVleet"
[[Fred VanVleet] Lol](https://twitter.com/FredVanVleet/status/1380192515391901701)
Everyone knows Fred VanVleet is the only player that Curry can‚Äôt cook on the switch
"Fred Vanvleet, Can shoot the lights out from three, plays good defense and can pass well too."
"The team was missing 6 players and three starters (after OG's ejection, the team's best defender by far). We know that at least Siakam, OG, and Fred VanVleet contracted COVID before the All-star break and FVV has gone on record saying it has affected their conditioning. Who knows who else got fucked up by COVID on the team. This was a second night of a back to back so any players suffering from conditioning are prolly going to play bad. and Toronto is the only team in the league that hasn't played a home game all season. Hot take for a single game tho, fam."
"That's what happens when you're missing 6 players. Missing Lowry, OG, and Fred VanVleet. The team has no centers...and Siakam has been trying to regain his conditioning after contracting COVID before the All-star break. We're a tanking team...why is this surprising for Laker fans? Wasn't too long ago when Lakers were a trash-ass team before LeBron joined and the team was gifted AD."
yall why cant jalen brunson be fred vanvleet? is it crazy to think that's an in-play outcome for him?
"his rim-protection is amazing, just like the other guys you talked about earlier, maybe even better.  what separates him from KP and KAT is his ability to play manageable defence on the perimeter, where the shifty guards reside. Put KP on Fred Vanvleet at the top of the perimeter and he‚Äôs getting absolutely dusted.  he‚Äôs also the anchor, he tells the other guys what to do and they essentially mold their duties to Goberts fit."
Its Fred VanVleet
Fred VanVleet and Westbrooks‚Äôs numbers here are not good at all. At least Fred knows to pass it out often
Fred Vanvleet or Jrue Holiday?
"Fred ""bet on yourself"" Vanvleet, Pascal Siakam, and Chris Boucher all have interesting stories."
He hates not only Fred Vanvleet but the whole country of Canada.
"Fred Vanvleet has never won a championship. You've got me there. Schroeder has of finals experience, yea?"
"Damn I guess that article was right. DeMar Derozan is the #91st best player in the league according to RAPTOR. They were right all along. The Spurs shouldve traded for Fred VanVleet, the #3 player in the league. But then again, with that Deozan trade, the spurs also got Poeltl who is 15th best in the league, so I guess the trade was pretty even."
"It's kind of funny how despite how ass this season was, we broke a bunch of team scoring records:  \- Most points scored in a 48-minute game (144 vs. Sacramento Kings, 8 January 2021 (W 144-123))  \- Most points scored by an individual player (54 by Fred VanVleet vs. Orlando Magic, 2 February 2021)  and now this"
Fred Vanvleet
"So Hubie Brown was right all along, and Fred VanVleet carried the Raptors in the Finals. BET ON YOURSELF"
Yes let's retroactively give the MVP award to Fred vanvleet for making it out of the east in 2019. And Butler out of nowhere with the RKO takes the 2020 mvp.  Jokic is Mvp.

"Holy shit, this article is so poorly written.  It's actually funny. While I can understand guys like Dray and Bam not making the top five while their teams wallow in mediocrity (I am looking at you though Pacers), the fact that the **next** five on their list hidden at the bottom are Matisse Thybulle, Fred VanVleet, Chris Paul, Jakob Poeltl, and Josh Hart leads me to believe whoever wrote this doesn't know a basketball from a hockey puck."
Fred Vanvleet - literally his motto

"His era is probably the worst efficiency wise for guards and the hardest to go against defenses, plus the pace was way lower, plus spacing was horrible pretty much. The dude was leading the nba in scoring back then averaging over 30 a game. I mean, if Fred VanVleet is averaging 20+ (love the dude), AI would easily average 35+ by just adjusting the numbers to todays pace and stuff. He was unstoppable even with the below average 3pt shot and i imagine he was putting in way less time into developing it than players are today. Plus, he was getting seriously beat up back then by everyone. Comparing eras is always fucked up but i have no doubt in my mind that he would be fucking tearing up the nba today."

"https://youtu.be/diklDy3-aaM  Not against randoms, but here is Fred Vanvleet after his rookie year where he only played 37 games absolutely destroying Marcus Posley, a full time GLeague player, and, at the time a high school prospect, Jordan Poole.   You can clearly see the gap is huge between Fred and the others. Yet Fred at the time was literally at the end of the bench for the Raptors."
"If that‚Äôs the case, then Fred VanVleet is the king of pounding the round and then driving into 3 defenders with a hopeless layup attempt."
"Raptors! Always teamwork first. Not really any superstar players. Everyone scores and flourishes under Nick Nurse‚Äôs playbook. Look at how many bench players emerged from his system. Norm Powell, Chris Boucher, Fred VanVleet, OG, just to name a few."
Its Fred VanVleet
"uhhh...  Damon Stoudemire/Vince Carter/Tracy McGrady/Chris Bosh/Marcus Camby  I would have DeMar over Damon, but the positions don't really match.  Honourable Mentions: PJ Tucker, Jonas Valanciunas, Roy Hibbert (who we apparently traded to Indiana), OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, and Fred VanVleet (who doesn't count because he wasn't technically drafted, though we did sign him)  This is a relatively young team so there's not a whole lot of talent to choose from, especially at point guard."
What does that make Fred VanVleet?
That sounds like Fred VanVleet with no defense.
"fred vanvleet shoots for 40% from the floor. that is god awful, i legit thought there was an error when i first looked at it."
Okay? Fred Vanvleet is not a star. He‚Äôs never made an all star or all nba team and he‚Äôs not popular. He‚Äôs not even your best player so idk why you‚Äôre so butthurt about it. Lowry sure and I would even give you Siakam but FVV? He‚Äôs very good but is he a star? Doubtful.
"In training camp, there were a few raps guards left trying out for one roster spot. I went to a preseason game as a random redditor had tickets for my son and I to go. Of the three guys playing , the only one I remember was the one I thought was terrible and too small. That man: Fred vanvleet. Happily happily wrong   It was then I realized that really don‚Äôt know shit about basketball like I think I do (although I knew knew knew we should have taken LMA that draft year after he destroyed in March madness but we had bosh so nooooooooo. We chose bargnani"
This is like saying Fred VanVleet is a better shot blocker than Bill Russell because the first one has 0.3 bpg and when Bill played they didnt count blocks.
1st Team: Ben Simmons Fred VanVleet Jimmy Butler Giannis Gobert  2nd Team: Jamal Murray Dort Covington Bam Embiid
"Exactly, with scoring and pace going up PPG is weighted less heavily, more emphasis on two way players, 3pt shooting and switching. 16 players over 25ppg and another 22 above 20ppg. 38 players over 20ppg and a good chunk of them shouldn‚Äôt be in the all star game. Guys like Fred VanVleet, Khris Middleton, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Collin Sexton."
"ok cool, triple his value and he's prob almost at 3/4 of a fred vanvleet"
"Hey Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby feel free to come back ASAP thanks."
"How are the raptors winning with no Fred VanVleet, OG, and Siakam? LMAO  Winning with Paul Watson putting in 20 minutes and losing 3 out of our top 4 guys wow..."
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
Fred Vanvleet might actually build a fringe hall of fame career out of the world's most depressing draft party goddamn
Like what the Raptors will be? Masai is gone. Lowry is regressing. Fred VanVleet isn't taking you guys anywhere. And no one wants to play in Toronto lmao you couldn't even get Leonard to stay
I think Fred VanVleet fits this pretty well.
Fred VanVleet.
"As a fellow undrafted player, what are your prospects on future contract negotiations after seeing Fred Vanvleet sign an 85 million, 4 year contract?"
"Found 5  * Terrel Harris (2010 Rio Grande Valley Vipers, 2012 Heat) * Cory Joseph (2012 Austin Toros, 2014 Spurs) * James Michael McAdoo (2015 Santa Cruz Warriors, 2015 &amp; 2017 Warriors) * Pascal Siakam (2017 Raptors 905, 2019 Raptors) * Fred VanVleet (2017 Raptors 905, 2019 Raptors)"
Fred VanVleet
New Nerlens Noel anybody? BeT ON YoUrSeLF  For every Fred VanVleet there are tons of Nerlens Noels and Oladipos.
"Skill boost OG, his biggest weakness right now is a meh handle which has locked off his non-spot up offense. He has shown improvement on that front like a lot of Raptors players have past and present (our training staff makes it a major focus) but taking OG from mediocre handle and a super high dribble that makes it easy to disrupt it to even a slightly above average handle + keep his dribble tighter will unlock a lot of his offense and push him beyond being arguably the best 3nD player in the league.  Athleticism boost to Gary Trent Junya, man has shown a little dribble drive game but the quicks and shiftiness ain't there to truly be an effective penetrator.  Height boost to Fred VanVleet. FVV is basically a SG in a 6'1 PG body which has really hampered his finishing which I believe he is one of the worst rim finishers in the league as well as struggling when his man is playing him right as well as having some size on him which is pretty much every single game now since he is playing SG alongside Lowry. 6'4 VanVleet would make his life a little easier on offense and kill off our biggest defensive weakness outside of Aron Baynes forgetting how to play basketball during the off season which is big off guards."
Fred vanvleet  Pascal siakam  OG anunoby
Fred Vanvleet?
1. OG Anuboby 2. Fred VanVleet 3. Pascal Siakam
"That's a stupid metric. You're trying to value something based off its very peak. You could then argue that ""at their best"", Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jason Tatum, hell even a Fred VanVleet type with one huge game are all comparable to AD then."
"bro if fred vanvleet has the ball, you foul."
"Wanted to correct, but it‚Äôs actually the other way around.   In Nurse‚Äôs book, he wanted OG to bring the ball up the floor more, but Fred would yell for OG to pass it to him. OG would defer, but he‚Äôd make comments to Nurse in passing about Fred continuing to demand the ball in the half court.  Nurse notes that this is the kind of thing a coach has to deal with. He wanted to experiment with OG on-ball more and Fred off-ball. But since VanVleet learned the game mainly as a primary ball handler, it was uncomfortable for him to adjust."
"Missed the part at the start where Fred intentionally fouled, Westbrook double dribbled and then he thought he was fouled so he carelessly turned it over. VanVleet and Westbrook were both baffled there."
Who does he think he is? Fred Vanvleet?
"‚ÄúThe biggest thing is he‚Äôs a super-positive guy,‚Äù Nurse said ahead of the NBA All-Star Game in February. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the guy sitting next to me when I‚Äôm sensing disaster going on in a game and he‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre gonna win, we‚Äôre gonna come back.‚Äô Constantly, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre gonna do it, we‚Äôre gonna come back.‚Äô And that helps me out quite a bit.‚Äù  Kyle Lowry, who can be harder to please, was succinct in his praise.  ‚ÄúI would say he is the fucking man,‚Äù Lowry said.  ""Nate is the [expletive] man,"" said Raptors guard Kyle Lowry. ""He's always that positive, happy go-lucky [guy], always looking at the plus side, not looking at anything negative. We need that.""  Lowry is not alone. Fred VanVleet called Bjorkgren ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù and called rumours he could head to Indiana ‚Äúwell deserved.‚Äù  ""I think Nate's fun,"" said Raptors forward Pascal Siakam. ""I hear him all the time in my ear talking about something. Every morning he'll say hi to you and give you a dab. He's present and I think his energy is felt and needed on this team. He's a great guy to have, a great coach and somebody who is a likable person and so serious about his job.""  u think people here just made things up and ran with it? lol"
Fred VanVleet always looks like he's on fire but then you check and he's 5/23 from 3
A massive part of it is how genuinely awful Bledsoe was. He was our third option and a borderline all star in the regular season so when he goes completely ice cold it‚Äôs a big loss and he became a liability to even have on the floor. Another big part of it is how hot Miami and Toronto‚Äôs shooters got. Fred VanVleet and Norman Powell were absolutely unguardable in our series. Same with Tyler Herro and even Jae Crowder in the Miami series. I‚Äôm just saying you have to look at things with context because a lot of things that caused us to lose are not the norm whatsoever

Nick Nurse is about to naturalized Fred Vanvleet in record time for this summer.
"He is 3rd for total deflections by a guard according to NBA.com/stats, behind FVV and TJ McConnell. He is also 5th for deflections per game behind Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, TJ McConnell and Fred VanVleet. If you consider Jimmy Butler a SG instead of a SF that pushes Thybulle to 6th."
"He is 4th in total deflections (193), tied with Ben Simmons and behind Fred VanVleet (194), TJ McConnell (217) and Robert Covington (229). Per game, he is 10th with 3.1 per game, behind OG Anunoby (3.2), Smart (3.3), Jrue Holiday (3.3), Larry Nance Jr (3.4), Butler (3.5), TJ McConnell (3.6), Covington (3.6), Ben Simmons (3.6) and Fred VanVleet (3.9)."
"6 foot point guard defending the rim against centers, just Fred VanVleet things."
"Fuck it let's try this...   PG: Fred VanVleet  SG: Khris Middleton  SF: Bojan Bogdanoviƒá  PF: Christian Wood  C: Nikola Jokic  Bench: Seth Curry, Chris Boucher, Gary Trent Jr, Lu Dort, Yam Madar just for the hell of it."
Who‚Äôs the guy at the last frame? He looks like a taller Fred Vanvleet.
"Drummond sucks at defense, sucks at offense and his rebounds are basically the only thing he does well.  And even they are a bit inflated because a lot of them are his own missed shots.  He makes both sides of the game worse for his team.    Gasol on the other hand, is a good enough shooter that he spaces the floor to the 3 line.  He's an amazing passer (2nd best passing centre after jokic)... Fred VanVleet said that it was like having another PG out there.  He's *still* a very good defender. The only weakness is super fast guards (like Kemba) give him trouble (since he can't stay in front of them).  He can score, but on a team like the Lakers, he doesn't need to score.     So what is he better at than Drummond?  Pretty much everything but rebounding."

"I think of a 3&amp;D player as someone who doesn't handle the ball or run the offense very much. In my mind, Malcolm Brogdon and Fred VanVleet are too good to be 3&amp;D players."
Chris boucher is weird on this list for me aa he's a C/PF.  I don't think of him as a 3&amp;d.  Fred vanvleet doesn't work either for me.    I always think of a 3&amp;d as a wing/oversized gaurd.   Tall enough to gaurd multiple positions but fast enough to lock down a guard. And stretches the floor while not being a ball handler.
&gt; Giannis is the most dominant player since the days of Prime Shaquille O'Neal   i've seen Giannis scared to post up Fred Vanvleet   10/10 trolling OP
Tell that to Fred VanVleet....
"Was he really though? Kyle Lowry was definitely the second option/player. Siakam balled out that title run, but he was a bit closer to Fred VanVleet than being 2nd best on a title team."
Fred Vanvleet and OG Anunoby
Lol they made it to finals and lost. We went to the finals and won plus been in the later stages of playoff for 6 straight not counting this year. You have a little win streak and go crazy you guys will always suck. Fred Vanvleet you guys just offered him a contract and he said no he would rather stay here where he can keep winning. If I'm not mistaken Knicks offered to make him a max contract player but who wants to play for a racist like Dolan?
"Who the hell would give a 14 and 5 guy a Max? No way he gets that. He will likely get somewhere between $18-$21 a year, somewhere in Fred Vanvleet territory."

Fred VanVleet and Steph Curry actually got to play against each other in the Finals. Cool moment for them.
"Fred VanVleet is a great interview, gives the reporters their respect &amp; can be insightful"

Kyle Lowry was better. Honestly Fred VanVleet might've been better too  We are doing better than you this year and your rebuild is delayed because you refused to trade Lowry at the deadline. You won one championship after being gifted stars for the past 20 years. LeBron owned your entire city for the better part of a decade and you're incredibly lucky that Kawhi bailed you out of mediocrity. The Knicks will rise again and the Raptors will go back to the gutter where they belong

&gt; that's going to stomp the league in a few years  30 year old Pascal Siakam/Fred VanVleet are so scary.
"&gt;Even before the NBA season began, things were already weird for the Toronto Raptors. They were about to get weirder.   &gt;The pandemic forced the Raptors to become NBA snowbirds as they relocated from Toronto to Tampa, Fla., where there are palm trees outside and ‚ÄúWe the North‚Äù signage inside, a move that turned out to be the beginning of a season that would make absolutely no sense.   &gt;They have since become the league‚Äôs most puzzling anomaly. There are good teams and bad teams every year in the NBA, but there has never really been a team like the Raptors. They‚Äôre either a bad team that‚Äôs good‚Äîor a good team that‚Äôs bad.   &gt;This is how much of an outlier they are: The difference between the Raptors‚Äô expected number of wins based on their statistics and their actual number of wins is the largest of any team with a positive net rating in at least three decades, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Stathead data.   &gt;There have been 39 teams in NBA history with losing records and positive point differentials, meaning they outscored their opponents for the season and still lost more games than they won. Most were barely under .500. There is one notable exception. The lowest winning percentage on this list of basketball aberrations would belong to this season‚Äôs greatest source of dissonance: the Toronto Raptors in Tampa.   &gt;They appear to be the best, worst NBA team of all time.   &gt;The Raptors are currently sitting in 11th place in the Eastern Conference with a 22-34 record after being ravaged by the coronavirus and living away from home while most people are stuck working from home.   &gt;If the NBA playoffs started today instead of next month, they wouldn‚Äôt even qualify for the league‚Äôs first play-in tournament. Not making the playoffs when more teams than ever will make the playoffs would be a huge disappointment, and it might even make sense at this point to bottom out temporarily and increase their lottery odds in a tantalizing draft.   &gt;But what makes the Raptors more interesting than other bad teams with tanking incentives is that it‚Äôs still not clear if they‚Äôre one of them. They have the mathematical profile of a team that‚Äôs actually good.   &gt;A funny thing about the NBA is that a team‚Äôs win-loss record is not always the most reliable metric of whether it‚Äôs good or bad, since that number is subject to luck, random variation, statistical noise and so many other vagaries of playing sports. A better measure in the short term is a team‚Äôs net rating‚Äîthe point differential per 100 possessions‚Äîand the Raptors have outscored their opponents. Their net rating is higher than the teams in seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th place in the East.   &gt;There is even a stat called Pythagorean wins that predicts a team‚Äôs expected record from the number of points it scores and allows. It was devised by the pioneering baseball quant Bill James and then applied to basketball by Philadelphia 76ers president Daryl Morey when he was a Stats Inc. researcher as a college student.  &gt;But not even a formula designed by the greatest analytical minds in sports and named after a Greek philosopher‚Äôs theorem is powerful enough to crack this NBA team.   &gt;The numbers suggest the Raptors should be 29-27. Instead they are 22-34.   &gt;Those numbers are skewed by their peculiar ability to win big and lose close games. The Raptors have somehow won nearly the same number of games by 20 points or more and 10 points or fewer. They also had six game-winning or game-tying shots in the final seconds of the fourth quarter before April‚Äîand missed them all. That helps explain why they would be the first team ever to outscore their opponents and lose more than 60% of their games.   &gt;That‚Äôs also part of the confusion. They have the statistical indicators of a good team and the record of a bad team. So which is it?   &gt;The answer is probably both, but it‚Äôs a tricky question. One of the more trivial difficulties of playing basketball during a pandemic is that it‚Äôs hard to tell what to make of a team. The season is shorter. The games are packed tighter. The arenas are emptier. Add injuries and Covid protocols. Subtract home-court advantage. What do you get?  &gt;‚ÄúA season unlike any other,‚Äù said Jack Armstrong, the Raptors‚Äô television analyst for the last 23 years.   &gt;But when it comes to evaluating any team this season, it‚Äôs hard to ignore the massive purple dinosaur in the room.   &gt;The NBA has managed to plow ahead with minimal disruptions and, like the rest of the country, can see light at the end of the tunnel with players getting vaccinated and fans trickling back into arenas. The worst seems to be over. But in a sport where one case and the subsequent contact tracing can wipe out an entire team, this season was inevitably going to favor teams that were spared the wrath of a microscopic pathogen.   &gt;Toronto wasn‚Äôt one of them. Raptors players have missed 114 days because of Covid-19 protocols, according to a Fansure study of the league‚Äôs injury reports. Only the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics were hit so hard.   &gt;Their exposure started with a Feb. 26 announcement that coach Nick Nurse and five members of his staff would be working remotely while sidelined by the league‚Äôs health and safety protocols, followed by Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby being out for more than two weeks each. The Raptors had three games postponed and then lost nine straight from March 3 to March 22‚Äîand the Covid-related free fall could have been worse if not for a weeklong break for the All-Star Game.   &gt;At the beginning of March, when their record was 17-17, they could squint at glimmers of hope. By the end of March, when they were dealing with the human toll of being demolished by Covid, losing 13 of 14 games and nearly trading Kyle Lowry, they were staring into the NBA abyss.   &gt;‚ÄúPretty much everything that could possibly happen,‚Äù Armstrong said, ‚Äúhappened.‚Äù   &gt;There are still reasons to believe this might be a good team disguised as a bad one.   &gt;It‚Äôs why the more obviously good teams aren‚Äôt exactly clamoring to play the 2019 champions if they can sneak into the playoffs. As far as first-round opponents for the Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers or Milwaukee Bucks go, this one would have the rough appeal of wrestling a velociraptor.   &gt;And it wouldn‚Äôt be entirely surprising if the Raptors do something else that no team with a losing record has done in three decades: win a playoff series."
OG Anunoby   Gary Trent Jr   Fred Vanvleet   Idk what it is about Toronto but everyone loves to overrate their role players. Might be because of their regular season success last year.
Fred VanVleet exists
"This is how bad he is.  This lineup:  Fred VanVleet, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, Chris Boucher, Khem Birch  Is better than this lineup:  Fred Vanvleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Baynes.  Khem Birch is such an upgrade that him plus G-Leaguers is better than 2 all-stars and OG."
Windhorst doesn't know basketball. He needs to stick to transactions.   He actuay thinks Drummond and Kuzma are good players.   This clown also tried to compare Dennis Schroeder to Fred Vanvleet.
"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."
PG: Chris Paul (15.8)  SG: Fred VanVleet (19.8)  SF: Michael Porter Jr (17.3)  PF: Draymond Green (6.6)  C: Clint Capela (15.4)
"Kawhi in 19, unless you want to say Fred VanVleet was a star."
"I just want to say: Fuck Jeff Green. Fuck player like him.  Against the Raptors in 2019, it was Fred VanVleet who couldn't miss  Against the Heat last year, it was Goran Dragic who couldn't miss  Against the Nets, it is Jeff Green  Why, why, why do one random shooter have a career series against us? Oh, I know why! Because of Bud's scheme. Still, most shooters at least miss some of their open shots. These shooters are literally hitting everything."
"Ok and Bball Index‚Äôs estimated wins added metric has Tatum tied with Dame for fifth most wins added and behind only Jokic, Gobert, Steph, and Giannis.  Edit: Also going purely by this:  Conley &gt; Doncic  Conley and Fred VanVleet &gt;  CP3, Trae, and Zack LaVine  Above guys and Chris Boucher and Poeltl &gt; Mitchell, Tatum, and Beal  Above and Boban &gt; Lamelo   Above guys and Alec Burks and Patrick Beverly &gt; Booker"
Something along the lines trade Kyle Lowry because Fred VanVleet is just as good or OG can be the next Kawhi (I too dream of this but I know it's a homer take)
3 words: Fred VanVleet
Fred Vanvleet spreading his 6‚Äô1 wingspan as wide as possible on every possession and leading the league in deflections is fucking inspirational man
When Fred VanVleet does it it works
"Agents often negotiate on comparisons. I‚Äôm thinking Schr√∂der and his agent wanted Fred VanVleet money ($85 million) as a base which only works if you win a championship and get that bump. They also knew the Lakers are over the cap and had limited options on replacing him. It was a calculated risk, and I get why he did it. Personally, I would have taken the $84 million."

Pascal Siakam ended up with the nickname Spicy P mostly because he told his teammates he didn‚Äôt like the name so it stuck. For some reason the Raptors sub was trying to make ‚ÄúIcy V‚Äù a thing for Fred VanVleet which was an S tier horrible nick name
"I never said soley low picks. I said ""low picks and trades""  Did Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry, etc sign with the Toronto Raptors? They never did.  Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, and Fred VanVleet. All 3 of those guys were picked 27th, 46th, and last one was not even drafted.   The team never had a top/lottery pick drafted on their roster. They never signed a top guy in free agency. When Masai got there he didn't have a player who was considered anything but a maybe boderline all-star in Rudy Gay. That's it."
"You‚Äôre going to have to cite what you‚Äôre claiming. Nowhere have I seen that Kawhi wanted to sign with PG right off the bat and that he even talked to the Raptors about trading for PG.  This is all I‚Äôve found:   &gt;	Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star reported the Thunder ""asked for Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and four unprotected first-round picks as a starting point for Paul George. The Raptors believed they were being used as leverage, and believed Kawhi finally, truly wanted LA. And then he left.""  Toronto was not trying to trade for PG, and Kawhi did not ask them to. Sam Presti was attempting to start a bidding war to get more from the Clippers. Source: https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2844408-woj-raptors-rejected-russell-westbrook-paul-george-for-pascal-siakam-trade.amp.html  I just gave you a source directly from Doc Rivers mouth that the timeline goes 1) the Clippers wanted to sign Kawhi, 2) Kawhi tells them they have to make roster changes for him to sign, 3) the Clips give him a list, 4) Kawhi chooses PG, 5) they trade for PG, and then 6) Kawhi signs. That *is* Kawhi forcing them to trade for PG. Forcing someone to do something can just mean to coerce them. It‚Äôs not necessarily through violent means."
it's so funny how Fred Vanvleet has a deeper voice than him.  No slander. Just funny.
"&gt;Blake was a freebie, but Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Claxton, the guy who looks like Fred VanVleet are all good players that most capped out teams wouldn‚Äôt be able to have.  What do you mean other teams wouldn't be able to have them? The Nets didn't do anything illegal to acquire their team"
"""The guy who looks like fred vanvleet"" is their 4th superstar."
Winning Championships is all about role players overplaying their contracts think about the raptors and how Fred vanvleet siakam gasol and ibaka all played way better than the deal they where in. Same for the Lakers last year rondo Dwight and kcp definitely outplayed their contracts worth

"FVV is strong and pugnacious.  I have no doubt that KP couldn't post up all 5'11"" of Fred VanVleet.  Fred has really strong hands too and would probably strip the ball every single time."
"KP is so weak and timid for his size, I genuinely don‚Äôt think he could post up Fred VanVleet"
"Trade Porzingis plus the worse version of him (Kleber). Need a big, doesn't necessarily need to be a stretch, and a secondary ball handler/playmaker.  Possible trade: Kristaps + 2 firsts (maybe add a second) for Chris Boucher and Fred Vanvleet"
No you can blame Fred VanVleet Junior for that
Basically Fred VanVleet
Bruh Fred Vanvleet is good
Mike James plays and looks like discount Fred Vanvleet
Is Fred Vanvleet a good comp for Mike James or am I just getting tricked by the beard? Trying to work out what sort of player he is
"For the folks contributing to the Schroder slander below, a few points:  * Schroder led the Lakers in A/TO ratio * Schroder had the third-highest offensive rating on the team, behind James and Davis * Among Lakers with 60+ GP, Schroder had the second-highest net rating behind only his most-frequent teammate, Caldwell-Pope * As noted elsewhere, among non-primary ball-handlers in the NBA, only Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two Pacers\* averaged more assists per game than Schroder's 5.8 * Schroder was 26th in the league in APG.  The only veteran among the 25 ahead of him who had a lower salary was TJ McConnell.  In fact, the only other ones even close to Schroder's $16M were Ricky Rubio at $17M and Fred VanVleet at $21M.  If you don't like Schroder's attitude, or off-court behavior, or whatever, then fine.  But if you are going to argue against his play, educate yourself first.  He was a fairly incredible bargain this past season.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Indiana's trio of McConnell, Sabonis, and Brogdon all averaged about 6.5 assists"
Bruh don't let the NBA fool you lmao its actually Fred VanVleet
It‚Äôs too bad he‚Äôs getting any time post-Pacers elimination game Paul George instead of 2019 Fred VanVleet to back him up
"Khem Birch, Fred VanVleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam"
This will be the first finals in 10 years without LeBron or Fred vanvleet
Fred VanVleet is definitely 5‚Äô10 too. Idgaf if he‚Äôs listed at 6‚Äô1 that boy short as hell
"You could pick LeBron + anyone who played in the 2019 Finals to make this statement true.  E.g. ""For the first time since 2010, neither LeBron James nor Fred VanVleet will play in the Finals"""
"Fred Vanvleet. He‚Äôs about your height and he‚Äôs not overly athletic or quick, just has excellent ball handling, shooting, and defense.  If you want to watch a superstar Chris Paul is another one.  Basically at your height you want your handle to be as good as possible so you can squeak by taller players.

"&gt;there's a reason a box and 1 works its when the other team doesnt have enough offensive threats that you can just key in your defense on 1 player.  I don't think you understand, if offense was ""way more important"" than defense, then Curry's offensive power should've been enough to handle the defensive threats the Raptors have since by your logic ""offense is more important than defense"". You're literally contradicting yourself. Curry was getting locked up by Fred Vanvleet and consistently asked for switches lmao."
"The point is that saying ‚ÄòPascal averaged 20 PPG on 50% shooting in the finals‚Äô is stupid when he was also playing with Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry whom were considered the two stars of the team, and the rest of the team composed of Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, and Fred Vanvleet.   Randle would be an outstanding third option, because that‚Äôs much easier than having to be the #1 and be gameplanned against every game.   There‚Äôs a reason why Pascals efficiency dropped 10% after Kawhi left. It‚Äôs just basic common sense. #1 option= very hard. #3 option= much easier"
"Don‚Äôt care, still had another veteran all star to take the load off of him, along with Fred Vanvleet, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka. Compare that team in talent to this years Knicks lmfao, Julius Randle has to be the #1 guy every night and is the guy the defense game plans around.   You can‚Äôt compare that to a guy who‚Äôs playing with two allstar teammates, one who‚Äôs a mega-star that carries the load every game. Julius is getting game planned for, Pascal wasn‚Äôt.   Also, what time does Pascals team play today?"
Fred Vanvleet is the reason we won in 2019. Without him we lose to Milwaukee.
"Yes I‚Äôm sure Randle would perform terribly if he was surrounded by Kawhi, Lowry, Marc Gasol, Fred Vanvleet. Everyone who upvoted this is dumb af"
He had Kyle Lowry and New daddy Fred VanVleet
Paul Pierce won the same amount of rings as Fred VanVleet
"looking at it now. Clint Capela #10, Fred VanVleet #17 (above Beal), Mikal Bridges #19 (the highest Sun), Jakob Poeltl #21 (one above CP3)... needs some work"
I know what you mean. It‚Äôs just how they‚Äôre registered.  [Fred VanVleet complained about this earlier in the year.](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-fred-vanvleet-shot-blocker-stats)
"Halfway into the season Fred VanVleet was ranked third in RAPTOR WAR. I love Fred, but I'd love to see the numbers that got him there."
Forgot about Fred VanVleet Sr.
Raptors won a championship playing Fred VanVleet 25mpg
"See then there Kyle Lowry and Fred Vanvleet, who routinely play 38+ minutes and clearly have some chunk on them"
I mean Kawhi still did that during this regular season that just passed (a lot of iso ball). Although PG took up more of a role facilitating or creating for himself this year too.  But Kawhi had a lot of spurts during that raptors run where he was cold on on offense and other players on that team went off. Siakim thrived with the spacing Kawhi provided and Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet both played like all stars in the post season.  Kawhi was the anchor of the defense on that team but that team was full of high IQ players and a really good system built around them. All the pieces put together really complimented each other well.
"The Toronto team had Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet who are both just entering their prime, also OG Anunoby who couldn‚Äôt play in our Championship run due to injuries.              The Toronto team was not only a better team than these Clippers, they also had a lot more upcoming talent than these Clippers.               Kawhi left mostly because of his family. If he expected to be on a better team then he was straight up deluisonal."
I‚Äôd protect:  1) Siakam 2) OG Anunoby  3) Fred VanVleet 4) Chris Boucher  5) Gary Trent Jr.
"** Jr Smith, Fred Vanvleet, and Tillman **"
"Ahh yes the Fred Vanvleet model of defense, an excellent vintage"
"It might get deleted since the Athletic will reach out to the mods if an article is copy/pasted, but here‚Äôs just the lists without the blurb included:  - Wizards: KAT - Celtics: Zach LaVine - Warriors/Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram - Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox - Hawks: LaMelo - Knicks: Lowry - Lakers: Siakam - Blazers: Jerami Grant - Mavs: Vucevic - Bucks: Fred VanVleet - Clippers: DeRozan - Nuggets: Terry Rozier - Nets: Harrison Barnes - Sixers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell - Suns: Christian Wood - Jazz: Collin Sexton"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"There's actually a shorter one:  - Fred VanVleet  - Bruno Caboclo - Vince Carter  - Hakeem Olajuwon  Granted, this one is a bit of a stretch since  that second connection between Bruno and Vince was when they were on the Kings."
"[FVV signed a 4 year deal for $85 million](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/toronto-raptors/fred-vanvleet-20778/) so a little more than $21 million per year. Not star money though, I agree, just wanted to provide the actual figures."
"Right, it has nothing to do with giving Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet $230 million lol"
Fred VanVleet-esque
"Silly take. Without the NCAA, Fred VanVleet and Lou Dort would be playing overseas."
"I think the ""If he dies he dies"" award should be most minutes played instead of MPG. For example, Fred VanVleet (#2 on the MPG list) played 1899 minutes this year (68th on MP list). RJ barrett played 2511 minutes this year 2nd only to his teammate Randle. It's not surprising the top 2 guys in MP this season are Thibs guys, given his name on the award"
Fred VanVleet himself would disagree with this title.
Fred Vanvleet. That is all.
"&gt;Measuring a player against the league average TS% is not a good way to judge them.  Looking at their contract and knowing he's a ""volume scorer"" yes it is?    &gt; Fred VanVleet who's had a TS% lower than league average every season of their career. Are you really going to say they're crap players because of that?  Fred has other value besides scoring on offense.  He has &gt;3 times as many assists."
"As a Bulls fan looking for a PG to fit alongside Zach Lavine and Nikola Vucevic I would go with:  1 Malcolm Brogdon  2 Spencer Dinwiddie  3 Fred VanVleet  Brogdon *slightly* edges out the others in some more advanced stats like TS% or PER but it's very slight.  Dinwiddie is the best facilitator of the group, but again it's only a slight edge.  For the Bulls it'd come down to the best on ball defender as that's currently a weakness on the roster in guarding other elite PGs in the NBA."
"More specifically cause he was hitting big shots AND guarding Steph Curry.   &gt; In the Finals, VanVleet averaged 14 points per game and shot 40 per cent from deep on 6.7 attempts, but, as Brown noted, his true MVP-like value came from what he offered Toronto on the defensive side of the ball, holding the Golden State Warriors‚Äô Curry to just 41.4 per cent shooting in the six-game series.  [Source](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/hubie-brown-gave-raptors-fred-vanvleet-finals-mvp-vote/)"
Didn't Fred VanVleet get 1 finals mvp vote? Why couldn't Khris get 1?
"Have you ever watched Vanvleet play? The man is a above average defender for sure, as is almost all nick nurse raptors. I can see a criticism of fred as a undersized guard but not as a defender"
He's on his Fred VanVleet shit rn
The Fred VanVleet Fan Fleet
"&gt;	as solid a 3-and-D player as you‚Äôre gonna get in this league outside of the superstars.  Outside of superstars? Last time I checked, there was a tier below superstars that included allstar/near allstar players like Jrue, Middleton, Klay‚Ä¶.         Then there is another tier of high level role players like Jae Crowder, Fred VanVleet, Ingles, Grant, OG‚Ä¶ that are 3&amp;D but unlike Wiggins, are actually elite at either defense or 3PT shooting (or perhaps both).             Wiggins is a tier below those players.           My point isn‚Äôt that Wiggins doesn‚Äôt have a place in the NBA, but the money he is making is absurd when all the elite role players I mentioned make waaaay less than him."
"Fred Vanvleet plus the 4th, Blazers will probably want one more piece.   If they get fred, maybe that can help them keep norm.   Lowry Dame OG Pascal Gillespie   Blazers could have: Fred Norm 4th pick CJ (they could trade for Simmons)  Nurkic"
"Look at Fred VanVleet, Siakam, JV, Poetel, Delon Wright - all developed under Casey. He was great for those young players"
"As a Raptors fan:  Fred VanVleet, #4 pick, Chris Boucher, however many future picks/swaps Portland wants. Basically anything on the roster except Siakam and OG.  (I know this won't happen and Portland will get better offers)"
"**2022 Raptors**  PG- Jalen Suggs, Malachi Flynn   SG- Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., David Duke   SF- OG Anunoby, Deandre Bembry, Rodney Hood  PF- Pascal Siakam, Jericho Sims   C- Richuan Holmes, Chris Boucher, Freddie Gillespie"
"This is strange, I've never seen this take from bucks fans before that Brook is a good rebounder. Having watched him all the way back since Brooklyn, it has been a known weakness of his and he would box out and tip to his teammates because he wasn't confident in securing them for himself. There wasn't a player on the nets that you would prefer to box out for as a seven footer, the safest option is always to secure it yourself as a center.  I am not calling Brook Lopez bad! My favourite players all have areas of the game where they aren't perfect! LeBron is a top 2 all time player and he can't hit free throws, that's just the truth; Fred VanVleet cannot finish at the rim, that's true. All I am saying is that Jarrett Allen is better at catching basketballs out of the air."
Fred VanVleet
"Fred Vanvleet received 0 Finals MVP votes. Unless you're assuming the Fianls MVP voters blackballed Curry, I don't understand what your point is. Okay, Fred Vanvleet guarded Curry. Curry still played great despite the help he received and FVV didn't play any better in the Finals than he did during the regular season. He was 4th in the Raptors in scoring for that Finals series. Iguodala last three games in the Finals of 2015 (when he was starting and received more opportunities) was averaging 21/6/5 being the primary defender on Bron and making the timely shots. He raised his game and then some. But if you're stuck on trying to draw similarities, go ahead. Just explain to me why the league would blackball Curry. We all saw the same thing. Zero voters voted for Curry. You tell me why."
Again you can apply this argument to fred vanvleet
Steph was the entire reason they were in a position to win though. I might be going extreme with this but that's like arguing Fred Vanvleet should've gotten FMVP for some clutch shots and slowing down Steph
"But that was a different situation - the Raptors knew they were getting played.   To quote the Toronto Star:   &gt; ""... the Thunder asked for Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and four unprotected first-round picks as a starting point for Paul George. The Raptors believed they were being used as leverage, and believed Kawhi finally, truly wanted LA. And then he left.""  If they thought Kawhi was gonna stay, maybe they make a deal. PG, Westbrook and Kawhi is an impossible combo to resist. But Toronto smelled something fishy, they could tell Kawhi wasn't gonna be a Raptor for long... and they made the smart move. So the original point still stands - no one turns down a combo like that. You just gotra make sure you're *actually* getting a combo like that."
He was an RFA in 2018 and then got a 2 year contract. This new contract was a UFA signing though he had his bird rights of course.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/toronto-raptors/fred-vanvleet-20778/ for reference
"There assets are Kuzma,22st pick and Harell and they cant trade any of THT,Shroeder and Caruso because of sign and trade rules  Good luck finding a star with that because I wouldnt even trade Fred Vanvleet for that trash lol"
"lmao.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbZ4xadmfbA  Giannis biting on an old Melo. Again, recovery is based 100% on athleticism but the initial defense was bad.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piTck0lyxV0 Fred vanvleet  kd 3 years ago  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLneJ8HTrk"
"Sir, no. You are forgetting Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Fred VanVleet, Donovan Mitchell, Shia Gilgeous-Alexander, CJ McCollum and Terry Rozier who could arguably be better than him. Booker, Brown, Mitchell and George are all definitely better."
#10+NAW+2023 FRP for Fred VanVleet?
"The Bucks have had this same problem with their defense for literally years. Doesn't matter if it's Fred VanVleet, Jae Crowder, or Mikal Bridges: they're getting killed from 3 by opposing role-players every time."
"Okay, Jrue is absolutely shitting the bed in the playoffs right now but I don't understand why people keep calling him an all-star. He was, once, in 2013 - the same year as Brook Lopez. It's not like he's been close in voting; I can't even find numbers for him for fan votes this year - but at best he's behind Fred VanVleet. Jeff Teague has a more recent all-star appearance than him! Jeff Teague!"
"I love me some Payton Pritchard, but Celtic fans need to *temper* expectations with this guy.  Some of our sub genuinely believes this guy should be a starting PG, although I highly disagree with that. I do agree that he's deceptively athletic and sports some impressive ball handling skills, but that's a testament to his work ethic. At 6'2, he's going to be limited on what he can do on defense on switches. Some people compare him to Fred VanVleet, and I think his numbers are very eerily similar as well.  At 23 -  &gt;**Pritchard's** 7.7 points per game, 2.4 rebounds per game, 1.8 assists per game on **44/41/88**   &gt;   &gt;**Fred VanVleet's** 8.6 points per game, 2.4 rebounds per game, 3.2 assists per game on **42/41/83**  I don't think Payton Pritchard has the defensive chops as FVV's, who's actually an underrated shot blocking guard for his size. But PP has a very high range, I've seen dude light it up from 32+ feet. He's also known for taking long deep bombs during his time with Oregon.  I liked FastPP, but I definitely clowned Ainge for pick, this is what I get for listening to Kevin O'Connor hype up prospects lol."
"I'm looking at the other teams in the top-10 and just not seeing anything Detroit should even look at.   Rockets have nothing.  Cavs have nothing. Some would say Sexton, but a terrible team has a good young player on the market. You can read between the lines.  Raptors? Why the fuck would you pass up on Cunningham to pay Fred VanVleet?!?   Magic? Lol.  OKC? This isn't the NFL. Hoarding a bunch of mid-first round draft picks doesn't get you that far. And a lot of those draft picks will come later than ""mid-first round.""  Warriors? We keep seeing this. ""The Warriors will give up Wiseman, Wiggins and the #7 overall pick!"" Lol. No shit. Why that would be remotely attractive to Detroit is a completely different story. Simply letting the clock run out and not making a pick @ #1 overall would be better long-term for the Pistons than taking that trade.  Orlando? Lol.  Sacramento? No. The only players worth trading are younger guys who have ""potential."" Gimme the guy with potential and who will be cheaper over the next few years than whatever the Kings offer up.  So, down to New Orleans. Should Detroit give up the #1 pick for Zion? Yes. Yup. Uh-huh. Affirmative. Will that be a trade that's offered? No."
uh-huh.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diklDy3-aaM   Fred VanVleet small enough for you?
Is Luka a horrific olayer?   He didn‚Äôt win the finals this year   Wait James Harden never won? Trash  Vince Carter? Ass  AI? Ass   Melo? Ass  PG? Ass   Fred VanVleet tho? Goated
If you add Fred VanVleet you can go back even further
"Might as well throw in Fred Vanvleet and Malachi Flynn as well, if you think so little of Steph."
Fred VanVleet Jr
"&gt; This is r/nba bruh it‚Äôs not r/MkeBucks  And you don't see me showing up in every Raptors thread.  Because I'm not obsessed.  (And because no one is talking about your shitty team.)  Your trolling is boring, turning off inbox replies on this.  Have fun staying salty, and continuing to watch the Raptors suck into the future.  Oh hey, one last thought: remember when your fans actually thought Giannis had any interest in going to Toronto to play with Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, just because Masai helped his family one time when the NBA asked him to?  That was pretty funny!  Maybe you were one of those morons and that's why you've stayed so salty to this day.  I guess I'll never know, well, until the next Bucks-related thread where you're bound to show up.  Goodbye until then."
He plays under the name Fred Vanvleet Senior
"Fred VanVleet 54 points on 11 threes with 3 blocks and 3 steals.  The guy shoots the f*ck out of the ball and is a terrific defender as well. Thats about all he‚Äôs *truly* great at.   It was also the most efficient 50-point game in NBA history, showing he can get blazing hot (like in the 2019 playoffs)."
Fred VanVleet -&gt; Fred VanVleet Sr.
"He'd probably get at least one vote. I mean, Fred VanVleet got a vote lol"
"I‚Äôm just not a fan of DLo like most people are. I think he‚Äôs overrated af. He‚Äôs a below average athlete, weak finisher around the rim, can‚Äôt defend, can‚Äôt cut off ball. His shooting is rather inconsistent for a guy that heavily relies on jumpshot.   He‚Äôs a nice role player that can run PnR, hit some floater and 3 here and there but he‚Äôs not the All Star people think All Star supposed to be  In a vacuum I‚Äôll take Malcolm Brogdon and Fred Vanvleet over him"
"Fred VanVleet the year the Raptors won the chip. Raptors didn‚Äôt have a superstar go down, but Kawhi was playing hurt."
"Finals?  I feel like what Boris Diaw did in 2014 against Miami was underrated.  Ron Artest/Metta World Peace against Boston in 2010, his defense and timely scoring.  Fred VanVleet for the Raptors in 2019, clutch shots man.  Drawing a blank on the rest."
definitely fewer. In the social media are there‚Äôs just more avenues for athletes to continue making money off their personal brand and network.   Personally i‚Äôd love to see Fred Vanvleet become a coach.
Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet are both 6.0
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
Fred VanVleet gets his haircut like every other week I think
"Just commented this elsewhere:   There's some reports Donovan Mitchell is unhappy in Utah. He's also supposedly a huge Mets fan, and is from NY, and may want to go play there. Could something like this happen if that is all true?  Knicks get:   * Donovan Mitchell  Raptors get:   * RJ Barrett  Jazz get:   * Fred VanVleet  * 2021, 2023 Dallas picks (from Knicks)  * 2021, 2023 Knicks picks  That may seem like an overpay from a Knicks fan's perspective. But you're giving up a guy who *might* become a star for a guy who *is* a star, plus four non-lotto 1sts. And the star you're getting is a guy who loves NY and wants to be there. A Mitchell/Randle core is a good place to be. And you're really not leveraging the future since you're giving up Dallas picks and this year's 1st, you still have all but one of your future picks.   Raptors do it to trade a win-now player for a SG prospect with higher upside (and one who's Canadian to boot!). If they draft Suggs, they'd have a sexy young core with Suggs, RJ, GTJ, OG, Pascal   Jazz do it (again, if Donovan wants out) since they get a proven win-now guard (same height as Donovan, believe it or not) that will let them continue to contend. And those four 1sts could be used to further shore up the roster via trade. Maybe you offer the Rockets Favors and 6 1sts for Christian Wood. (Would be 6 1sts since none of them would be lotto picks). That would be a significant upgrade."

54 points 3 rebounds 2 assists 3 steals 3 blocks  Steady Freddy with the franchise record! Also the fact he had 3 ‚Äúblocks‚Äù. Mid season DPOY candidate Fred Vanvleet
Imagine paying him the same as Fred Vanvleet
"That's not what the market says. Regardless of how many max contracts you think there should be, an efficient 20 ppg scorer would probably cost you a pretty penny in free agency if the Nuggets wanted to replace his production. You can even ignore the age part. Tobes certainly wasn't given a max contract because they thought he'd make a leap when he's 28-32. Even if you can nab a steal like Fred VanVleet, you're still paying +$20 million per year  But ofc, a team of Dame/Murray/Jokic wouldn't necessarily need that kind of production"
Wonder who has the higher shooting arc between him and Fred VanVleet.
Fred Vanvleet. Malachi Flynn
Norman Powell and Fred Vanvleet. Sorry couldn't help myself. Go get that chip Bucks!
It depends on if a team wants to make him a focal point of it's offense. A lot of basketball is opportunity.   I think his best case scenario is a Fred VanVleet situation.
CJ also plays smaller than his measurables.   Hes not like a Fred Vanvleet type sg that plays taller than he is and can make up for his lack in size defensively
"No, but Fred VanVleet SENIOR can."
Fred VanVleet and Ron Baker come to mind.

Also calling him the one and only fred vanvleet when he named his son after himself lol
"Player development and trades. The Sixers FO were so focused on losing games, they forgot to develop their young players (you can't do both at the same time). The Sixers were looking for gold in the draft instead of finding guys like Terance Mann, Fred Vanvleet and Kevin Huerter to fill in the gaps in their team."
"I think OP clearly is asking who‚Äôs in their peak prime years, not who is still priming but may have dropped off 1%/5% whatever. Middleton, AD, Kyrie, Beal I think are pretty much in their absolute peak, also Fred VanVleet, Jordan Clarkson. Pretty much guys around 1991-1995ish. Kawhi/KD/PG are clearly priming, but lost at least 1% from their peaks. Giannis/Luka are also priming but still trending up."
He's the anti-Fred VanVleet.
dont take anything this sub says seriously. people were saying Fred Vanvleet was a better player than Russell Westbrook.

Fred VanVleet
"They're different players. Smart is an incredible defender and has been forever.  Fred though, might be the smallest chaos agent in the NBA.  Most of what he does defensively that makes a huge impact won't be found on the stat sheet - he really has adopted so much of Lowry's strengths.  [https://www.raptorsrepublic.com/2021/03/16/fred-vanvleet-should-be-the-2021-nba-defensive-player-of-the-year/](https://www.raptorsrepublic.com/2021/03/16/fred-vanvleet-should-be-the-2021-nba-defensive-player-of-the-year/)  Cool little article highlighting some of what makes him special. Obviously we should disregard the title, but some interesting stats...  6th - miles covered per game running the floor  2nd - deflections per game (3.8)  5th - recovered loose balls per game (1.3)  5th - steals per game (1.7)  This guy not only averaged 1.7 steals....but 0.7 blocks per game.  Ultimately - I give the edge to Fred Van Vleet. Smart was drafted 6th overall. FVV went undrafted. On top of that, even if Smart is the notably better overall defender, what Fred can do offensively and as a leader and culture setter is what puts him ahead. He might be one of the greatest underdog stories in NBA history.  Just my two cents. Both great players."
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they‚Äôve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn‚Äôt an executive in the league that matches Masai‚Äôs overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
Fred VanVleet but can't be mad at the Smart contract at all

"Pascal Siakam - lives up this name 'Shock'em' when he takes over games  OG Anunoby - he's no longer a new noobie  Fred VanVleet - not a van rental company with a fleet of vans  Scottie Barnes - not a barn or more  Khem Birch - he could be a tree hard to move, yes  Malachi Flynn - His father Eric, active social media, doesn't think that nn (nick nurse) is fly for not giving his son playing time  Chris Boucher - lives up his Trebuchet moniker due to his unique 3pt catapult-like release"
Raptors was running a ton of it for Norman Powell and Fred Vanvleet in recent years
"Fred ""Bet on yourself"" VanVleet"
"I totally agree about him being a 6MOY finalist. He would be a starter on most teams. He‚Äôs very, very similar to Fred VanVleet in that he has such a complete game all around."
"It was actually Fred VanVleet that did it first, but Murray had a 50 point game more efficient than Kyrie‚Äôs like two weeks after Fred. Fred‚Äôs game was slightly better in regards to TS than Murray‚Äôs so it was more efficient, but you could also argue that Murray‚Äôs was more impressive because he did it without shooting a free throw."
"Maybe if he is traded he could be like vanvleet, but Fred has never had to play with someone like Luka doncic, who controls the ball the whole game. He has comparable stats but not a comparable game"
"I have no idea, Kawhi was freaking amazing &amp; it‚Äôs like this reverse narrative that everyone on the Raps performed great the whole time (Fred Vanvleet showed out after his baby was born but before that he couldn‚Äôt buy a bucket &amp; that was like half the playoffs). Kawhi knees were looking kinda wobbly too, the man went the distance."
I would imagine the raptors close out games with   Fred vanvleet  GTJ  OG Barnes Pascal  And that‚Äôs probably better defensively than the Celtics so I wouldn‚Äôt say the Celtics are the best defensive lineup.
Never face Fred VanVleet when his wife is in the 3rd trimester.
98.54% TS in this game.   The only person with a more efficient 50 bomb: &gt;!Fred Vanvleet 54 Points on 100.15% TS!&lt;
Fred Vanvleet is 6'1 and an excellent defender
Fred VanVleet is the owner of this term. He definitely bet on himself and made it happen.
"Scrolled way too far to see this. Idc if you think SGA, Ja, Jaylen etc are better than him (they're not), putting him in a different tier entirely is utter disrespect. This mf put Fox in the same tier as Seth Curry, Fred Vanvleet, and Robert Covington"
Fred Vanvleet literally ripped the ball out of Giannis‚Äô hands so idk you tell me

Kawhi guarded Giannis after going in an 0-2 hole. He definitely was not guarding Curry that often in the 2019 finals. Fred VanVleet was chasing Curry around screens and holding him off most of the time.
Fred vanvleet had 14 total points in the 7 game series against us where kawai hit his game winner . He was borderline unplayable and had his minutes reduced from his reg season avg. So yes Ben Simmons just had a series where he struggled but fred has had that happen too.
Cannot believe all of you are seriously saying Fred vanvleet lmfao

Fred VanVleet and Jonas Valanciunas
This is getting way more common than you think though  Look at Fred VanVleet
"Isaiah is even smaller and worse defensively. That being said, I don‚Äôt buy into the notion that you‚Äôre automatically a bad defender if you‚Äôre undersized. Just look at cp3, pat bev, Fred vanvleet"
Not even close to the best run ever. He shot 43% FG in the finals. He made more free throws than field goals. Fred Vanvleet got a FMVP vote lol.
"How about just short Point Guards?  *Stoudamire, Bogues, T.J Ford, Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet.*  It‚Äôs like franchise tradition.  Can‚Äôt forget Mike James."
"&gt; Right? I‚Äôll never fault a guy for betting on himself.  Fred VanVleet -- a much better player -- got basically the same contract offer from the Raptors (4 year/$85 million) and accepted it. Was there any scenario where someone would have offered him substantially more???   Hell, Lowry, THIS YEAR, just accepted ~$25million for the first year and he is a multiple time all-star (even if you mention his age, this year he'd be worth more than Schroder). Schroder's desire to want $25million/year+ is at best *crazy*. He's done *nothing* to merit paying that kind of money."
"the funny part is that Fred VanVleet -- a significantly better player, offensively, defensively, making a team run and proven winner in the playoffs -- got basically the same offer from the Raptors (4 years/$85 million) and accepted it.    So I still don't get why he thought that somehow he was going to get so much more, when it was clear that it was a veeeeery generous offer from the Lakers."

Fred vanvleet
Fred VanVleet
"It's a decent core for a contending side, but we lack the #1 option to be up there. We'll be a tough side to face with that defense, but lacking the bonafide star some of the teams in the East have. Nets - 3 of them, Bucks - Giannis, Sixers - Embiid, Heat - Butler, Hawks - Trae, Celtics - Tatum, Bulls - LaVine I have these 7 sides to be in the playoffs for sure, then us in the bracket with Pacers, Knicks, Hornets and Wizards, all of whom but maybe Hornets have a better first option.  We need a franchise cornerstone to go around these elite role players in VanVleet, OG, and a great #2 option in Siakam. Hopefully Barnes can develop into that, we luck into another high pick next year or trade Siakam for a few young prospects (I like if we can get Wiseman and Kuminga or Moody plus Wiggins for filler) and retool around those, Barnes and OG with Fred as the vet. But unless those pan out, or we happen to be in the right place at the right time for another disgruntled star, we're not scaring anyone for a while."
"Imagine being a point guard, having Fred VanVleet on you, and if you want to switch, 3/4 of your options are OG, Scottie, and Pascal lmao."
"Raptors have been able to improve the shot of most of their recent projects like Siakam, Fred and OG.         [Asked who the team‚Äôs ‚Äúshot doctor‚Äù is, VanVleet pointed to Nurse. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the one crazy enough to study all the dynamics that go into shooting,‚Äù VanVleet said.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/article-nick-nurse-learned-importance-of-shooting-repetition-at-early-age/)  I think they are betting that they can fix his shooting and if that works, then they might find themselves a two way wing."
Fred vanvleet is likely the starter
"Fred VanVleet kind of did though‚Ä¶ Every time he covers Curry, Steph gets a few more Raptor scars on his arm from being held.      Have no idea what Steph did to piss off the refs that other teams know they can get away with bodying him and even admit it."
"No, not explaining; saying ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt clicking on your end. Embarrassing.‚Äù makes you defensive. I think I would prefer to be considered to be weird from your perspective lmao. paul george is like a foot taller than fred vanvleet lol wym what does it matter i think that matters"
"This is what I think many people miss, but Durant takes it a step further. You can *never* expect to lock down superstars.  Andre Iguodala isn‚Äôt locking up LeBron James, Fred VanVleet isn‚Äôt locking up Steph Curry, Lu Dort isn‚Äôt locking up James Harden, PJ Tucker isn‚Äôt locking up Kevin Durant. A lot of people like to think these guys can lock up some of the game‚Äôs greatest scorers, but that‚Äôs not true. What often happens is that one might think those superstars had off/quiet nights but you check the box score and they had a quiet 30. They‚Äôre superstars for a reason."
"Is that what I said? Fred vanvleet and nothing? If so then you‚Äôre right to say that, but is that what I said?"
"Raptors GM Bobby Webster had a press conference yesterday to clarify that ""the goal isn't to tear it down to the studs and 'trust the process,' rather Toronto wants to build around its core of Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam""  I'm sure they will listen to the Kings but they are not looking to rebuild and will not trade Siakam at a discount.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/raptors/.amp/news/toronto-raptors-bobby-webster-build-around-young-core"
"Fred Vanvleet, Malcolm Brogdon, Mikal Bridges"
"Fred VanVleet is actually very likely imo. He was on the fringes of being a reserve last season. Now with Lowry gone and being back in Toronto with no Covid, Baynes, etc. he‚Äôs going to have an increased role so it will be there for the taking. Just up to him to perform and the Raptors to win games."
Fred vanvleet is a ball hog and is a shooting guard trapped in a point guards body
Payton Pritchard is not Fred VanVleet
"start lebron - cameback down 1-3 down and made steph and dray cry in their own home      bench giannis - cameback down 0-2 in finals, made booker cry and stopped a scott foster rigjob    cut kahwi - carried by fred vanvleet and lowry, would have blown 3-1 lead if klay dont get hurt"
"[Jalen Suggs](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-jalen-suggs-nba-draft-preview) ""Toronto, as Suggs acknowledged, has one of the NBA's best developmental programs.

[Evan Mobley](https://www.si.com/college/usc/basketball/evan-mobley-shares-opinion-on-toronto-raptors-organization)  ""They're a good player development organization,"" the 20-year-old said.

"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
"Bet on yourself when you have nothing to lose. Like Fred VanVleet. He was not drafted. He said no to a crap G league contract, it‚Äôs not $80m lol. ( I think it was G league? Or is it summer league)."

&gt; would be the best PG on your roster.  Have you heard of Fred VanVleet?  Did you know that FVV averaged 6.3 assists vs. 4.4 for Goran? and FVV had better assist to turn over ratio than Goran? Oh and FVV is 10x the defender that Goran is. Bro watch a team or at least check your stats before typing that nonsense wordwall.
Fred VanVleet.
Fred VanVleet
For every Fred VanVleet there is a Dennis Schroeder and Nerlens Noel
&gt;  I think he would prefer simmons to work on his jumper and come back significantly improved.    I would prefer Fred VanVleet to come back 7 inches taller and develop a post game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Undersized ballhandling shooting guard Fred VanVleet cannot playmake to save his life.
"no, kyle Lowry filled a pretty hefty hole. fred vanvleet will need to beef up if he wants to replace him fully"
Fred VanVleet
Was the previous record holder Fred VanVleet?
"That team was so stacked now that I think about it..  Kyle Lowry  Danny Green  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Marc Gasol  Fred VanVleet  Norman Powell  OG Anunoby   Serge Ibaka  A solid 9 man rotation with a perfect blend of offense and defense.. and that‚Äôs not including guys like Chris Boucher, Patrick McCaw or Jeremy Lin"
"Masai just on the Raptors  (discounting the Melo trade in Denver that was amazing and the Kawhi trade because we all know):  - Traded Bargnani's awful contract for a lottery pick    used to select Jakob Poeltl.   - Traded Greivis Vasquez to the Bucks for 2 picks that turned into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell.   - Signed Fred VanVleet to an undrafted deal.   - Traded Valanciunas, Wright and picks for an old Marc Gasol so we could win. Morey refused to do this for Lowry and that's why Sixers couldn't go further.    - Traded Terrence Ross and a second for Serge Ibaka.     - Drafted Pascal Siakam #27 when few had heard of him.    - Fired Casey and hired a largely unknown Nick Nurse.     Masai is a tier above Morey. He has had elite moves i  trades, drafts and coaching hires. They shouldn't be discussed in the same breath."

"&gt; NEW YORK ‚Äî The Golden State Warriors basically assumed the 76ers‚Äô offer as a joke.  &gt; The Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight‚Äôs NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons, according to multiple sources. The Warriors quickly turned down the offer.  &gt; This comes after a source confirmed The Ringer report that the Sixers asked the San Antonio Spurs for four first-round picks, three first-round pick swaps and a young player in exchange for Simmons.  &gt; According to The Action Network, the Toronto Raptors rejected the Sixers‚Äô asking price of Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and the fourth pick in tonight‚Äôs draft for a package that included Simmons.   &gt; One league executive said the Sixers are making ‚Äútotally outlandish offers.‚Äù"
"Haven't been following so had to look this up...  &gt; The Philadelphia 76ers reportedly offered Ben Simmons to the Toronto Raptors for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and the No. 4 overall draft pick  LMAO wtf.    Masai probably rolled right out of his chair with that kind of ""offer"""
"Imagine offering ben simmons for kyle lowery, og, fred vanvleet and the fourth pick. That‚Äôs insulting"
"I don‚Äôt agree with that at all, his ceiling is definitely a solid starting point guard. Tell me how a guy like Fred Vanvleet can be a &gt;20mil a year player and a guy like Pritchard who can shoot better, facilitate better and run an offense better is a career backup? 50/40/90 players who can run an offense and not turn the bell over are really valuable. You realize even young teams want to start winning in the next few years, fill out talent on the wings and a lob target or two, and drop Pritchard as the steady, efficient point guard.  Do I guess agree to disagree...I‚Äôm not too eager to give the bank for a guy like Beal anyway, I don‚Äôt think he moves the needle much on a winning team.  I personally think Pritchard, Nesmith, Langford and Williams have gave potential to take big steps this year, so I‚Äôd rather not sell low on them."
"there was a fun video at one point with fred vanvleet facing off against a top g-league guy and a top draft prospect in a practice gym.  it was meant to showcase just how wide the talent gap is even at the highest level. it was both entertaining and eye-opening, wish i could find it now but i cant"
"In Morey delusional mind he would have the 4th pick as well,                                                so in lala land his starting 5 would be...  Jalen Suggs, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid."
"**How the phone call went down:**  Morey: *""Good morning Masai, I'd like to offer you an amazing deal. I'll give you Ben Simmons in exchange for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, your first round 4th pick as well as--""*  *Click *   Morey: *""Hello? Hello!?!?""*"
"If you‚Äôre a player at the bottom of the 2nd round, you can request them to not draft you and try to get signed.   2nd round contracts aren‚Äôt guaranteed any ways. Fred VanVleet tried this and got signed as a 4th string PG on the Raptors   If you‚Äôre a first round pick, they‚Äôll just pick you"
"Bruh, if I'm Toronto I wouldn't even trade Fred VanVleet straight up for Simmons after his playoff debacle"
"The little guy will rise again. As the average player gets bigger and bigger eventually we will hit a tipping point where it's more advantageous to stick a 6 ft skilled guy out there to slide through screens and cause havoc than get the extra length and verticality of a tall PG. Heck I'll point you to 10 months into the future and all nba third team member Fred VanVleet. Height is good, ability is better."
"It makes some sense in the abstract. Ben Simmons is a young all star in good health. Anunoby and Vanvleet are high level starters, with outside all star potential in the next three years. The fourth pick is really good most years. So on paper? It's not too out there.  But the reality of the trade is far from that. OG is among the best and most versatile defenders in the league, Fred is a borderline all star already, and this year's draft is allegedly four stars deep at the top. On top of that, Simmons has tanked his stock due to his own in court play, something I can't remember any precedent for in the past decade.  If Masai took this deal I would honestly stop following the Raptors."
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
They might as well ask for Fred Vanvleet Jr and all the first born on the team while they're at it
"These are the guys that are getting around 20 million a year. W/o even going into how the good ones aren't easily available, one of these guys + the 4th pick is straight up worse than Simmons. Realistically that 20 million isn't going to get you more than two decent role players, I'd still take Simmons  Nikola Vucevic, C	Chicago Bulls	$24,000,000  Julius Randle, PF	New York Knicks	$21,780,000  Malcolm Brogdon, PG	Indiana Pacers	$21,700,000  Gary Harris, SG	Orlando Magic	$20,482,143  Danilo Gallinari, PF	Atlanta Hawks	$20,475,000  Jerami Grant, SF	Detroit Pistons	$20,002,500  Domantas Sabonis, PF	Indiana Pacers	$19,800,000  Fred VanVleet, SG	Toronto Raptors	$19,675,926  Zach LaVine, SG	Chicago Bulls	$19,500,000  Goran Dragic, PG"
"Fred VanVleet 4/6 from the field 2/2 from 3. Hmm, that's nice but let's see him do it in a playoff series. Also this ""Siakam"" guy should probably stop shooting threes."
Fred VanVleet or Patty Mills
Fred Vanvleet would‚Äôve won those 3 point contests in that era over bird. Kds long ness make him a greater shooting threat. He‚Äôs harder to guard
Fred Vanvleet?
This could actually be good for the raptors and 76ers if they do this right. I think that maybe I can't remember if Kyle Lowrys contract had ran out possibly trade him or Fred vanvleet with picks since the 76ers are contending they would have a player with championship experience that fits there team like Lowry. The reason it would be good for the raptors is because they are rebuilding so they could rebuild around siakam and Simmons and make a system where Simmons actually fits and can be used to his full potential.
"If there's any team that can revitalize Simmons career, it's Toronto. If you look at the track record of player development: Powell (42nd pick), Fred Vanvleet (undrafted), OG and Siakam (picked in 20s).. The Raps know how to make players better and the guys mentioned above had nothing given to them and they had to earn it. Put Simmons on this squad where he needs to work for his success, I can actually see him turning his career around."
"There‚Äôs a wide gap between not good and fucking max contract lol. THT is fine, but Jesus dude 4/83 puts him with Jalen Brown, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Issac, Malcom Brogdon, Myles Turner, Fred Vanvleet, Jerami Grant, etc.  *could* he be as good as those guys someday? Sure, why not? Should he be getting paid like those guys with his contract? Hell nah."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De‚ÄôAaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De‚ÄôAaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he‚Äôs on a team that hasn‚Äôt made the playoffs since 2006 and isn‚Äôt exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He‚Äôs not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you‚Äôre the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn‚Äôt going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven‚Äôt made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn‚Äôt have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn‚Äôt go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am completely off the ‚ÄúBen Simmons has superstar potential‚Äù bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It‚Äôs been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he‚Äôs going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it‚Äôs not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He‚Äôs their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He‚Äôs a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton‚Äôs contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6‚Äô1‚Äù shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it‚Äôs not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks‚Äô title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that he wasn‚Äôt the most deserving candidate. He‚Äôs a great player don‚Äôt get me wrong but it‚Äôs a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can‚Äôt help but wonder if that Jazz would‚Äôve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he‚Äôs consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I‚Äôd believe DeRozan‚Äôs role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he‚Äôs still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he‚Äôd be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn‚Äôt able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He‚Äôs going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he‚Äôs still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn‚Äôt play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year‚Äôs draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga‚Äôs Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we‚Äôre already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
He‚Äôs nowhere close to jokics current level and their is 0 scenarios where he gets there.  ‚ÄúHow close is Fred VanVleet to Damian Lillard?‚Äù
"Kyle Lowry /  Jose Calderon /  Fred VanVleet  Honourable mentions: Damon Stoudamire, Alvin Williams, TJ Ford"
For guards it‚Äôs Fred Vanvleet.
"Steven Adam's has a incredible season shooting 47% from 3 on 7 attempts per game, leading the pelicans to the finals along side zion and Ben Simmons after a blockbuster 7 team trade. They then lose in game 7 vs against the Raptors lead by Isaiah Thomas, MVP fred vanvleet, and FMVP Goran Dragic. Lebron retires, Ben Simmons retires, and Richard Jefferson comes out of retirement"
"Favorite Raptor would OG Anunoby/Fred VanVleet  Favorite player in general would be Kawhi/Luka  As you can tell, I'm awful at picking one favourite."
"raptors were so stacked, we had normal powell, fred vanvleet, ibaka coming off the bench. also og was injured."
"Its not just kawhi alone. You need to remember that that whole 2019 team was offensively stacked. Gasol, lowry, kawhi, and green were all 3 point threats. That makes the defense much less willing to help on siakam moves. Vanvleet doesnt have that luxury this season when most of our 3 point shooters kept getting sidelined due to injury or covid protocol. This season was just messed up for us but fred was still consider an all-star snub. Next year is when we can really see the team mold together.   As for AD and DWade, those are 2nd-options for potential dynasty teams. Teams that can look to repeat or win multiple rings. Milwaukee won it this year with Khris Middleton as their 2nd-option. So did the Raptors with Siakam, and so did the Mavericks back in 2011 with Jason Terry (who was their second leading scorer)."
They did not face the real Fred VanVleet
"I‚Äôll compare Fred‚Äôs numbers with Siakam‚Äôs numbers in the 2019 run:  Fred Vanvleet: 19.6 PPG,  6.3 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG, 1.8 TOV, 39% FG, 36% 3P on 9 attempts, 41.6% eFG, 23.2 USG%.  Pascal Siakam (the 2nd-option): 16.9 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 0.9 SPG, 0.7 BPG, 47.0% FG, 36.9% 3P on 2.7 attempts (went down to 27% in the playoffs), 1.9 TOV, 59.1% eFG, 20.7 USG%.  From here: Vanvleet has more points, steals, and better 3 point shooting when considering volume. Equal blocks, and lesser turnovers. Basically the only thing siakam was better at was shooting efficiency, which he benefited from Kawhi‚Äôs gravity. Vanvleet doesnt have that same luxury. Keep in mind they also have similar usage rates. Vanvleet is on par with 2019 Siakam, who was our second option."
And got outplayed by fred vanvleet on both sides of the court in game 6
"Well he jumped from 10.6 to 15.9 PPG last season. And went from 7.0 to 10.6 the year before. So he has been improving consistently. And also, he‚Äôs 23. Thats still very young. Just to compare, fellow teammate pascal siakam went from 7.3 to 16.9 PPG when he turned 24 and continued to improve afterwards. Another teammate (Vanvleet) has been improving since he turned 23 and hasnt looked back. In fact he dropped a 50 bomb last season. These are all guys who are under the same system and have similar approaches to their attitudes, so i cant see why pascal and fred can be on that 2nd-option level but OG wont be."
Give me Fred VanVleet!!!!
"&gt;my point is these teams should rebuild through the draft or continue to develop those players   They would be rebuilding through the draft in hopes of getting a player as talented as Simmons. Why do that when you can accordingly trade for him when he‚Äôs still young on a long term deal?   &gt;not trade for ben simmons and his giant contract.   You‚Äôre eventually going to have to pay players no matter what and all these guys I named are on starter level, high starter level contracts and some like Sexton, hunter, reddish may all see new deals nearing 20+ despite not being nearly as good as Simmons. Money isn‚Äôt a problem.    &gt;if the pistons traded cade cunningham for simmons it would probably make them better, would they ever do that tho?   Ok but we‚Äôre not talking about #1 pick Cade Cunningham, we‚Äôre talking about rotational guys like Fred VanVleet, Derrick white, Harrison Barnes, Collin Sexton etc."
"&gt;Morey allegedly asked our team for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, a Kyle Lowry S&amp;T, AND the 4th-overall pick.  This was hilarious when it could be argued that a Simmons for Lowry and a middling player is an even trade."
"That and Jakob Poetl/Derrick White being borderline All Stars and Zach wasn't left me scratching my head a bit.  I'm not quite as in love with Zach as the rest of my Bulls fans, but he's *at least* as good as Fred Vanvleet and Derrick White."
"no idea why you are getting downvoted. Fred Vanvleet has a really nice game, and he is a solid above-average starter and could possibly get an all star game if he pops off this upcoming year. That being said, would anyone really put him in their top 10 or 15 players? Is he really above these players:  Jokic, Embiid, Bron, AD, Kawhi, PG, Curry, Luka, Harden, KD, Kyrie, Giannis, Tatum, Trae and just pick Mitchell/Booker/Ayton/CP3/Lavine/Butler/so many other players for your 15th spot. Who on this list belongs lower than FVV?????"
&gt;Fred VanVleet: All-Star  :D  &gt;Pascal Siakam: Average Starter  D:
"DeMar (4-time consecutive all-star if I recall correctly), Jakob (young promising prospect), and a late first round pick was considered a slight underpay for one year of Kawhi Leonard.  Morey allegedly asked our team for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, a Kyle Lowry S&amp;T, AND the 4th-overall pick.  Morey set his asking price too high, and the rest of the NBA moved on without pursuing Simmons."
"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.   I'd choose KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond, with DeAndre Ayton at center  For the bench I'd go with Mike Conley, Buddy Hield, Covington,  OG Anoubly, Capela, Joe Ingles, Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Fred VanVleet, Tobias Harris  Maybe throw in PJ Tucker instead of a big for a death lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, PJ, Draymond and just destroy teams offensively and defensively with intensity."
"Starters:  steph (superstar)  klay (all-star)  og anunoby  giannis (superstar)  deandre ayton (all-star)  Bench: fred vanvleet, seth curry, caris levert, michael porter jr, aaron gordon, chris boucher, brook lopez   Good combination of offense, defense, play-making, and fit imo"
"PG: Shai Gilgeous Alexander  SG: Paul George (allstar)  SF:  Kevin Durant (superstar)  PF: Jayson Tatum (allstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  \---  Bench PG: Fred Vanvleet  Bench SG: Mikal Bridges  Bench SF: OG Anunoby  Bench PF: Robert Covington  Bench C: Myles Turner  \---  Third string: Marcus Smart  Third string: Marcus Morris  &amp;#x200B;  I think starting lineup is basically impossible to guard. Bench is more so developed to focus on defense and basically hold the fort down while my starting lineup rests. Third string are luxury players for niche lineups. For Marcus Morris specifically, I think he may be the player best suited to do a small ball closing lineup at center of non-stars/non-superstars."
"I only remember him for leaving Fred VanVleet wide open near the end of game 6, which allowed Fred to hit a 3 just as warriors were starting to pull away."
Fred VanVleet Sr.*
Fred Vanvleet and Steph Curry
"EPM produces some results that do not pass the eye test. I personally would not say that Fred VanVleet is the best shooting guard in the league, or that Jakob Poeltl has a more positive impact on his team that Anthony Davis or Donovan Mitchell."
Fred VanVleet feels like he tries the same stuff that doesn't work over and over again and expects it to work.
Cj. A variety of good role players like Beasley bev mcdaniels and co. Collin sexton. Fred VanVleet. Malcolm brogdon.  And Houston is likely a bottom 5 seed this year. Why would they trade their pick unprotected ?
1.	Jaylen Brown 2.	Jamal Murray 3.	Ben Simmons 4.	Pascal Siakam 5.	Brandon Ingram 6.	Domantas Sabonis 7.	Dejounte Murray 8.	Fred VanVleet 9.	Malcolm Brogdon 10. Caris LeVert 11. Jakob Poeltl 12. Buddy Hield
That's Finals MVP runner up Fred VanVleet
"1. Ben Simmons  2. Jaylen Brown  3. Domantas Sabonis  4. Brandon Ingram  5. Pascal Siakam  6. Jamal Murray  7. Malcolm Brogdan  8. Dejounte Murray  9. Caris LeVert  10. Buddy Hield  11. Fred VanVleet  12. Malik Beasely  13. Jakob Poeltl  14. Alex Caruso   I understand that this may be controversial so please enlighten me on how I'm wrong, but please keep the Ben Simmons slander to a decent level. We can't just pretend he isn't a great player."
If this guy could be a Marcus Smart/Fred VanVleet level impact player a *few years down the line* we‚Äôd be very happy.   I think that is around his ceiling but it‚Äôs a bit premature to say anything definitive about a player who is basically entering his actual sophomore year playtime wise.
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I‚Äôd rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"As much as I want to throw up in my mouth for even suggesting it...   How about something structured around Fred VanVleet + Goron Dragic for Simmons? That's tons of savvy guard scoring and leadership for Philly and the Raptors can fully embrace their goal of gigantic, defensive focused, basketball. I love Fred as much as the next guy but I am just so damn intrigued at the idea of playing Simmons, Gary Trent Jr, Scottie Barnes, OG, and Siakam. That would be revolutionarily gross basketball and I'm all for it."
"&gt;He was the douche in that meeting.  I think you should re-read what I wrote. I think James already told Riley I'm not resigning with you guys and Riley said give me 5 minutes I'll change your mind.  Think about canceling a gym membership, phone bill, or internet service. You already know you made up your mind. You were on hold for several minutes and finally you get to the agent. ""Hi, I'd like to cancel my plan"".  You think it would be ""Ok certainly is there anything else?"". No it's never that, it's let me slowly convince you to change your mind. ""I'll give you this amazing offer to reconsider! BUT WAIT if you stay with us think about this and this!"", ""I'm not authorized to do that but if I can put you on hold I'll get my manager and she/he will tell you what I already told you 5 minutes ago!"".  At that point you already told them what you wanted and they won't budge, you'll be irritated and as you said maybe a *douche* at this point. I've seen LeBron during timeout giving his full attention, he notified Fred VanVleet in-game where he was suppose to do during a play. I have the utmost confidence if LeBron was serious he'd give his undivided attention...   I'm certain this was an informal meeting from Riley that LeBron tried to decline politely and reluctantly agreed to shut him up."
Fred VanVleet Snr comes to mind.
I don't think he's a top 10 playmaker. Fred vanvleet who's playmaking gets criticizes by the entire fan base averages a higher AST/TO ratio with a 0.6 difference in APG last year.    I know simmons is a better playmaker than Fred but quite a bit but just a reference.
"To be fair, we did not have a center.   6 foot fred vanvleet had more blocks than our starting center last season"
"Not sure about other teams, but 2016 was pretty big for the Raptors.  - 9th overall: Jakob Poeltl (traded for Kawhi Leonard)  - 27th overall: Pascal Siakam  - Undrafted: Fred VanVleet"
Not the same size but Fred VanVleet shows some of the same energy today.
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
"Alright lots of weird stuff to unpack here. Dekker and Bonga were signed on training camp deals, they're not guaranteed roster spots. We have other guys on training camp deals that are much better players.  Fred VanVleet was definitely not our best player last season, he may have put up 19 points but his efficiency was terrible. I would say Siakam was the clear best player, averaging 21pts, 7reb and 4ast on good efficiency.  Also, Bobby Webster has said many, many times that they're building around Fred, Siakam and OG so trading Siakam makes 0 sense.  Boucher is definitely a PF, not a C. He got C minutes last season due to our lack of proper Cs but will almost certainly fill the backup PF role this season unless he's traded.  Also I find it funny you say OG is ""developping into one of the best 3 + D players in the game"" like he isn't already one of the best. His defense is a lot better than just ""good"", as well."

"&gt;I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto  Guess you forgot that Pascal Siakam, Fred Vanvleet, OG Anunoby, Norman Powell, and Chris Boucher ever existed."
i watched him asking to be switched off Fred VanVleet. If you can‚Äôt defend FVV you are not a good defender.
"&gt; 1. Stephen Curry, Stephen Curry, Stephen Curry, Stephen Curry and Fred VanVleet: 11 3PM &gt; 2. 8 players: 10 3PM &gt; 3. 10 players: 9 3PM  I feel like this even undersells that Curry hit 10+ threes 7 times.   Like, Curry was 3 of the 8 players who had 10 3PM."
"Stephen Curry, Stephen Curry, Stephen Curry, Stephen Curry and Fred VanVleet walk into a bar..."
Fred VanVleet should be HoF just for that 3pt record üòÇ
"&gt; Ignoring the contradiction in calling the team ""talent-starved"" when they have OG, Siakam and VanVleet plus promising young players in Trent Jr., Scottie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa, if it involves trading Fred along with Boucher, Dragic and a first, then I am absolutely not in favor of it.  They are 100% high end talent starved.   OG, Trent Jr. Scottie and precious are all good role players or show promise. FVV is a really good guard but not quite all star. Siakam with no injuries is an all star except he's coming off injury.   This team replaced Lowry, Kawhi, Ibaka/Gasol with noone of similar value. We completely lack high end talent. We have no first start, we have no leader like the way Lowry was. We have no quality centers like Ibaka/Gasol. Our Center rotation right now is just good backup centers being played as starters.   Pascal is coming off injury,  his ramp up to game shape will take a while and the jury is still out if he can ever become an all star again. He willl no doubt struggle on a team without a true point guard in the starting lineup. FVV is not a point guard. He's a shooting guard in a point guards body.   I won't argue how good of a shooter FVV is. but he isn't really a leader and he isn't a playmaker. and he's streaky prone to hero ball espeacilly with even less talent around him.   I see Ben brining playmaking, defense and scoring on this team. He has shown he can do that in the regular season and is only 24.   Do i want to trade the whole kitchen sink for him? No but you would be absolutely the biggest homer ever if you don't think he could bring value to this team if we didn't give up too much for him.  He would instantly help Siakam, and FVV if we could keep him in a trade.  Salary wise? cap space means nothing in Toronto since we will never attract a big FA. We need to find our stars in trades or drafting.  I want to stress, for the right price, Ben is a great get for this team."

Fred is our second-best shooter Pascal (arguably he's our most efficient shooter from the 3), an offensive threat and a natural leader.  With Lowry gone, that last factor is going to become more important, and I don't see Ben bringing that leadership to the Raptors, let alone being our first, second or even third option on offense unless Nick Nurse and our staff can work on his ""pass first"" apprehension to shooting.  And even then, I'm not optimistic about our chances of ""fixing"" Ben Simmons."

Kawhi probably thought that was Fred VanVleet not Drake and opted to join in.
"PPG ain't everything chief. Guys like Draymond, Chris Paul and Fred VanVleet being the model"
"The last time they approached the Raptors they were asking for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and the No. 4 pick in the 2021 NBA Draft.   Which is just absurd. Even a FFV, OG, Barnes trade would be too much for Simmons.  Your idea probably would be a win/win for both sides, but unless the 76ers come to earth a trade ain‚Äôt going to happen."
Fred Vanvleet and Kawhi are finally teaming up again
"i really dont see why he couldnt have stayed in the league, i mean look how fat his boy Fred VanVleet has come"
"7 feet 190 lbs, good gravy. I'm 5'11"" and when I was lifting weights a lot more and also got a little chubby, I was flirting with 190.  nba.com has Fred VanVleet at 197 pounds, Kyle Lowry at 196, Chris Paul at 175.  Strap this boy into the force feeding apparatus."
Fred Vanvleet?

Toronto has a good offer.   Fred VanVleet + Chris Boucher would both help the Sixers immediately.
"Oh no, Simmons lowered his trade value! Now Morey won't be able to get Siakam, Fred VanVleet, Scottie Barnes, 3 FRPs, the 2019 Larry O'Brien, Masai Ujiri, a Drake feature and a stake in MLSE in a trade! Truly tragic"
"Daryl Morey will now only ask for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and 2 first round picks (E: autocorrect)"
Pascal Siakam is an average starter.  Fred VanVleet is an all-star.
"Somewhat related to meeting an NBA player, I met Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) from Entourage while he and his family were vacationing at the beach I used to work at. He was with his in-laws and had just had a baby, so he was kinda pumped to have a young guy to chat with for a bit, especially after I told him that meeting him had made my day. I‚Äôm Canadian and had played against RJ Barrett when I was younger, so we talked about how RJ was gonna fit on the Knicks and whether the porzingus trade was a good call. We then started talking about the Raptors and how pumped I was that they had won it all. Turtle said his player comp was Fred VanVleet and he loved watching him cook in the playoffs. I told him my player comp would probably be Kevin Love because I‚Äôm a relatively unathletic  white guy who can crash the boards hard, bang down low, and shoot well. Turtle roasted me for saying Kevin love is my player comp and after that, he got stuck on dad duty, so we didn‚Äôt talk any further."
Fred Vanvleet/Kyle Lowry/Chris Paul
"Its clear that Morey values Simmons more than 3 high level starters, look at the trade proposals that have been leaked  &gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in the 2021 NBA Draft, and two future first-round picks.  &gt;Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and the No. 4 pick.  Both of these should indicate the trade value Morey's ranks Simmons.   &gt;The Knicks could have traded Randle, RJ, Mitch and 4 FRPs to the Rockets  If the Knicks were offered that then they would be dumb to pass that up. Harden is perennial MVP candidate and future HOFer in his prime even with the possibility that he would get upset any team would trade for Harden because he changes your team to a contender with just him on the roster.   Harden is not comparable because Simmons is clearly not the level of player he is, and his trade (and outcome of trade) should not be seen as a comparable situation given how the context of the two teams are so different."

"8 man playoff rotation:   - Kawhi Leonard - Kyle Lowry - Pascal Siakam - Fred VanVleet - Norman Powell - Marc Gasol - Serge Ibaka - Danny Green  and OG Anunoby had an emergency appendectomy the eve of the playoffs and missed the entire postseason  The deepest team I've ever watched as a Raps fan. Zero defensive weak points and balanced offense across the entire roster. Shooting and scoring from all 3 levels, great playmakers and finishers, and subbing in Nick Nurse for Casey put them over the top."
Yeah but Fred Vanvleet thoüòÇ
"I think people will look back at the 2019 raptors once it's all said and done and realize how much talent we had.   Lowry, Danny Green, Kawhi, Pascal, and Gasol was an amazing starting line up but Danny and Gasol were older and Pascal is still developing to this day.  Ibaka was an amazing bench big for us and was imo in his prime that year.  Fred vanvleet and Norman powell were on small contracts and have both shown improvements in the past 2 years, Norm especially looked amazing last year.  Og Anunoby didn't even play in the playoffs. He's still developing and has a high ceiling.  Chris Boucher went from playing garbage time to seeking a big contract next off season.  Jeremy Lin, and Jodie Meeks had their time in the sun at one point. Patrick McCaw was decent but injury prone.  If you combine each players peak salary year once they've all retired it will be a very high figure."

All you need to do to know everything about fred vanvleet is watch this clip
"These kids just don‚Äôt know, the only knowledge of basketball they have is making a super sayian Fred vanvleet looking player and jacking threes in the Rec."
"I'm going to throw a few bullshit names at you, and out of curiosity, (ignoring contracts), who would you 1-for-1 Ben for?  Colin Sexton  Brandon Ingram  CJ McCollum  Jerami Grant  Demar Derozan  Pascal Siakam  Jamal Murray  Malcom Brogdon  Domantas Sabonis  Chris Lavert  Fred Vanvleet  Kemba Walker"
Gonna have to go with Vanvleet he would just replace our current backup point guard who‚Äôs...not very good. If FVF and Herro were our backcourt for our bench unit that offense would be great. Plus I know it would be a great fit chemistry wise.  Simmons on the other hand...I can‚Äôt imagine the chemistry issues that would arise. Not only with Jimmy but the entire organization. Also no way...he would come off the bench.   All that being said...if we took Fred I would feel so bad for the Raptors. We have taken so much talent from them mostly Bosh and Kyle and I honestly love the Raptors even if they are another team we compete against.
VanVleet and it's not even close.  Look at their contracts and how much they contribute to their respective teams in the regular and playoffs.  Fred got that Finals MVP vote for a reason.
"They also go completely supernova on the court and never miss. See: VanVleet, Fred.  It's win/win."
"MIAMI ‚Äî For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry‚Äôs face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      ‚ÄúI knew I was good,‚Äù Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. ‚ÄúI knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.‚Äù      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee‚Äôs tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      ‚ÄúWe all were mutually agreed that it was time,‚Äù Lowry said of leaving Toronto. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.‚Äù      His journey in Toronto started with questions ‚Äî he was the team‚Äôs backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash ‚Äî crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      ‚ÄúThe city of Tampa was great,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúIt was just difficult because we didn‚Äôt know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.‚Äù      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team‚Äôs dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team‚Äôs president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      ‚ÄúSometimes franchises have to do what‚Äôs best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn‚Äôt say power ‚Äî but I had a little bit of, ‚ÄòListen, it‚Äôs not going to be a good look if we don‚Äôt collaborate on this together,‚Äô‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúWe all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      ‚ÄúWith DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.‚Äù      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,‚Äù Ujiri said at a news conference in August. ‚ÄúWe knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.‚Äù      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.‚Äù      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been super athletic,‚Äù Lowry said with a laugh. ‚ÄúI can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I‚Äôm not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don‚Äôt need to be jumping.‚Äù      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry‚Äôs sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry‚Äôs primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan ‚Äî ‚ÄúSmooth,‚Äù Lowry said of DeRozan. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my best friend.‚Äù      And of Leonard: ‚ÄúA machine,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúHe gets it done.‚Äù      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game‚Äôs quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      ‚ÄúI partly think it‚Äôs to get him going, because he‚Äôs got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,‚Äù Lowry said, adding that ‚Äúsome people can‚Äôt take it‚Äù and think Butler‚Äôs a jerk.      ‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs just how he is,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúEverybody has different demands on themselves.‚Äù      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,‚Äù Butler said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible. It‚Äôs a blessing, and sometimes it‚Äôs a curse because you‚Äôve got to be in some really great shape if you‚Äôre out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.‚Äù      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      ‚ÄúFreddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I‚Äôm the guy who was like, ‚ÄòYo, it‚Äôs on me,‚Äô‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúThey have to take the criticism, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.‚Äù"
"This was a really nice moment in a night that was pretty hard to watch at times. He's definitely going to be fun to watch all season  In general, things were pretty wild out there. There were several drive and kicks where the ball went to an empty part of the court or the pass was way off (thinking Birch to VanVleet where Fred had to sky with one hand just to get to the ball) and even one when we just straight up passed it to the Wizards. It feels like this will settle in time as the guys get used to each other and know where to expect their teammates"
Fred VanVleet tried one of those tonight and also got nothing. I don't think he complained very much tho so maybe his heart wasn't really in it
"Damn Fred ""westbrook"" vanvleet"
"Fred ""Kyle Lowry"" Vanvleet"
"It was, if I recall correctly, Lowry S&amp;T, Fred VanVleet, OG, AND the 4th pick (which would've meant either Suggs or Barnes to the Sixers)."
"Simmons trade idea of the day:   Sixers receive:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  Wizards receive:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors receive:   * Davis Bertans  * Seth Curry  * Kyle Kuzma  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Sixers 2023, 2027 1sts   * Sixers pick swaps every other year available  * Wizards 2025, 2027 1sts   We know that the Raptors were interested in moving on from Siakam last year (he was heavily linked to the Warriors). We know that the Wizards could use Ben Simmons. We know the Sixers are win-now and want star power.   Sixers immediately say yes to turning Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Maxey, and picks into Siakam and VanVleet. That's two borderline all-star level players that take them, in my opinion, to the top of the Eastern Conference. VanVleet/Green/Siakam/Harris/Embiid is ridiculous. Fred and Pascal can both shoot well enough, Pascal is of course a do it all wing, Fred can run point, and both play good defense.   Wizards move a negative asset (Bertans), some second-rate youth, and some picks for Ben Simmons. A Beal/Simmons pairing works really well. Simmons can run point and play defense, Beal can play off ball and take all the shots.   Raptors move a guy they've been interested in moving (Siakam) plus a guard in his absolute prime who has limitations to his game and who doesn't quite fit their timeline (Fred). In return, they get a wealth of picks and young players, plus a PG and two forwards who can contribute immediately (Seth, Bertans, Kuzma). They can probably flip one or more of those guys for more assets or a player who fits better. Meanwhile, Matisse is a total Masai player, and Maxey is a decently promising young guard -- something the Raptors lack.    Who says no?"
"Winning a championship in Milwaukee is a lot easier when your first season as GM you have Giannis scoring 27PPG and Middleton at 20PGG. Masai came into a team where our franchise record win total was 47, and then every single season up until the Fuck Tampa Bay Season we beat that. The franchise ""centrepiece"" was Rudy ""Not This Guy"" Gay.  Is it an accomplishment? Yeah, it is. Winning any championship is a major accomplishment. But when you just walk into a team that already has your franchise centerpiece and his second guy on the team, that is the two most difficult things to build a championship team already done for you, all you gotta do is just build around them. Which he did, which is more than many other execs can say. Masai had to trade Melo during his first season as the Nuggets GM, then two seasons later had a team that won 57 games which is more than any Nuggets Melo season, then came to Toronto where our franchise centerpiece was Rudy ""Not This Guy"" Gay and our team never won more than 47 games. We then beat that 47 game mark for the next six seasons, flipped Rudy Gay for bench pieces that helped spark the team into making the playoffs, exceeded all expectations in the mid to late first round + second round drafting players such as Siakam+OG+Northman Powell, kawal the Knicks into giving up a first round pick for Primo Pasta Bargnani which became the 9th pick Jakob Poeltl who was then traded for Kawhi, build up our scouting + player development staff into arguably the best in the league which has given us players like undrafted free agent Fred VanVleet + developing players like Siakam, OG, Northman Powell, etc. I think that in its totality is more impressive than what Horst has done so far.  And Masai isn't the GM he is our team president. He was promoted to Team President in 2016, then Jeff Weltman was GM for one season then left to become the Orlando Magic GM then Bobby Webster was promoted from Assistant GM to GM which he holds to now. Toronto Raptors General Manager Bobby Webster won a championship at the tender age of 34 years old."
Patty Mills needs the Fred VanVleet barriers that block him from going inside the 3 point line lol
DeAndre is just betting on himself but not everyone gets the Fred vanvleet treatment. Dude should learn to compromise.  Is he really gonna be upset making like 30m less or whatever offer they would give him that's not the max. He's being unreasonable.  Are we about to witness another Dennis Schroeder?
"I kinda wish I said 9 inches in the post. I would made Fred VanVleet 6'9"" to match the rest of the squad."
Fred VanVleet with a 40 inch vertical and 7‚Äôft wingspan
"Fred Vanvleet All star, Raptors make the playoffs, OG a MIP atleast, Siakam Allstar, Scottie ROY, NN COY  if atleast half of these are correct, I'm happy"
Fred VanVleet
"Yeah I'm normally big WB critic but outside the top 100 is crazy lmao, if it's about efficiency why is Fred VanVleet all the way up at 25?  Honestly switch them, the Raptors were bad last year and FVV shooting below 39% from the field didn't help"
Our starting PG called OG the #1 option (at least while Siakam is out).  https://raptorsrapture.com/2021/10/10/raptors-fred-vanvleet-og-anunoby-top-offensive-option/
Not bootleg Fred VanVleet
ik some are even saying fred vanvleet is better than simmons too like tf bro? thats how you turn a team into a purgatory team
"The criteria in the draft is very few busts and a good number of players who over-achieve considering where they are drafted.  So for the Raptors these are their 1st round draft picks:  Scottie Barnes  Malachi Flynn  OG Anunoby  Jakob Poetl Pascal Siakam  Delon Wright  Bruno Caboclo (bust)  Terrence Ross  Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas  So 1 bust in 10 years. Pretty fucking good resume.  All of the players on this list are legit NBA rotation players, and a few have become borderline All Stars.   Pascal was selected 27th overall and is now a #1 option who scores +20-25 ppg, made an All Star Team and was All NBA.  OG was selected 23rd overall and is now one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and avgs +17 ppg and 40% from 3 point range.  And the list goes on.  And this is not including the undrafted talent (Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, REDACTED) that they have managed to find over the years."

"I'm not a big fan of on/off in general, since I think it can easily suggest things about a player that aren't true. In the case of the Raptors, there was a stretch where VanVleet, Siakam, OG, and a couple of other guys were all out with COVID at the same time. The Raptors understandably got killed in the games all of those players missed and Lowry's +/- took a hit because of that. I think that Lowry was probably about as impactful as Fred, Pascal, and OG in the minutes he played overall.   Having said that, Fred was a big driver of success for us last season. He can also do many (but not all) of the same things Lowry does and is better in a couple of areas as well. In particular, I think he is a better defensive player than Lowry at this point."
It's so crazy to think that this is the same kid in that workout video with Fred VanVleet on YouTube...
"Biggest place I see this is player stat posts. Like when a player has a great night and someone will posts splits or details on how it's impressive.   If Fred VanVleet has an incredibly average shooting performance, there will be a stat thread with some description about how he went on a ""six point run"" or something.   Credit Raps fans love their players, and I think that's cool to see compared to a lot of other fanbases."
"What exactly is Simmons' perceived value? For reference, here are 3 offers that other GMs rejected from Morey:  1. OG Anunoby, Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, 4th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft  2. Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft, and 2 future first round picks  3. CJ, three first round picks, and three swaps  I'm not entirely sure what dangerous precedent is hanging in the balance here but it seems that other GMs cant see eye to eye with Morey's perception of Simmons' perceived value."
They got some explaining to do because why the fuck is Fred Vanvleet higher than Julius Randle
Finals MVP vote-getter Fred VanVleet
"I think the raptors have the biggest draw. The raptors develop anything and treat people with respect.   It's a big city with media stars like drake. Jb and the weekend pulling up from time to time.   Trade Fred vanvleet , since he's a versatile scorer and decent passer avg 6 assist. With Chris boucher , Goran dragic for Phillies draft pics next 2 years and Tyrese Maxey, Isiah Joe rookie too.   I say by November when the raptors have a slow star when they realize pascal siakam isn't the  the first option type of guy but a co star."
"Kawhi is obviously the best defender on the team but he was injured and was not able to play that kind of defence in the playoffs. Siakam was the guy asked to close out on every 3, switch from Giannis to Middleton guarding both guys, he was the most versatile defender team had too. Yes great defensive team all around, but siakam was asked to do the most, outside of Vanvleet for those 6 GSW games. But Fred played and did much less for the rest of the playoffs."
I don't see how the Knicks or pacers are better than Chicago and the bulls had the 12th ranked defense I think derozans playmaking in the half court will allow zach lavine to give more effort on defense and get easier shots    I doubt the Raptors will be the 9th or tenth seed pascal siakam is a 3rd option at best fred vanvleet is solid but I don't think he can get much better and if I'm not mistaken Barnes is a project player who's raw so I don't see him adding much
Boris Diaw  Danny Green (Spurs)  Matthew Delavedova  Deshawn Stevenson  Shaun Livingston  Fred VanVleet
Fred VanVleet holds the record for most threes off the bench in a finals series
Fred VanVleet in shambles
"Trying to stay somewhat realistic, giving him one star teammate and then some solid role players would look like:   PG - Simmons  SG - Fred VanVleet SF - Duncan Robinson  PF - OG Anunoby  C - KAT  Surround him with shooters, solid defensive players, and some extra playmaking so he‚Äôs not always the main ball handler. Scoring wise he should be a 4th option, but usage wise he should be around 2nd or 3rd on the team."
"Paul George will be top 5 in mvp vote(get that bias out of the way)  Jordan Poole wins MIP.  Fred Vanvleet is the raptors best player next year.  Indiana will trade multiple starters, only levert is untouchable.  Celtics get the 3 seed, blazers get the 4 seed.  Utah has the best record in the league again and makes the finals."

"Blowout trade:   Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Raptors get:   * Tobias Harris  * Matisse Thybulle  * Jaden McDaniels  * Taurean Prince  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts  Sixers run VanVleet/Cury/Green/Siakam/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man. That's a great, well-built roster (better than trying to force Siakam/Harris to play together)  Timberwolves get Ben for their assets, as they desire  Raptors move Pascal (which it's been hinted they want to do) for McDaniels and Matisse, who both fit their prospect profile to a T, plus Tobias Harris to fill in for Siakam -- they can flip him later for more assets. In the mean time, they run Dragic/GTJ/OG/Harris/Boucher with Flynn/Thybulle/McDaniels/Barnes/Precious off the bench. Plus some draft capital to play with"
Fav: Jamal Murray  Least: Fred vanvleet... I hate his stupid hair and beard so much plus he fucking cooks me in 2k
"Klay also put up 27 points on better efficiency that game but let's ignore that I guess  And did Curry ""rise up"" vs the Raptors when he got outscored by Fred VanVleet in the elimination game? On his own home court at that."
mobley for fred vanvleet
"Yeah you guys cried and called him because you were scared of LeBron  And then the next Finals he wasn't there you got owned by Fred VanVleet lmao  Your fans never liked him while he was there anyway and your comment proves it, you were so jealous of him winning Finals MVPS"

"I didn't know what FVF meant, so then I searched for it, and found out you meant Fred VanFleet, but then I learned his name is Fred VanVleet - real Berenstein bears moment - so it should be FVV."
"I mean‚Ä¶ it has John Collins, Fred VanVleet, and Alex Caruso as better players than Durant  And it has Gary Payton II as the 21st best player in the league  And it has the Warriors at 4% chance to win the championship at this point in time (with an 18-2 record!) even though it assumes Klay will return."
Joe Harris doesn't deserve that much. He earns as much as Fred VanVleet.

"Being a fan and being a coach is different. You don‚Äôt see everything as a fan. I‚Äôm not pertaining to your iq with the example im about to make but moreso your or better yet OUR naivety when it comes to assessing rotation and minutes. Remember when fans wanted lin to play cos lowry and vanvleet were slumping hard during the start of the playoffs 3 years ago? Coach knew lin was unplayable but ‚Äúwhat could go wrong‚Äù considering kyle and fred were playing like shit? Well we can consider the possibility that coaches don‚Äôt want to play players that are not supposed to play that type of minutes. Maybe they sucked at practice, maybe they suck at defensive rotations, following their offensive schemes‚Ä¶. Just because you‚Äôre talented doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get minutes. It sets a bad example for the team when u play a ‚Äúscrub‚Äù even when they don‚Äôt deserve it. There are times when coaches play their bench players more but they have to earn it. Borrego is not a dumb coach. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs done a heck of a job and is making this team overachieve and build something good. Warriors fans need this type of patience with Wiseman as well (they were amazing when they started benching him last year). He‚Äôs very raw and will be having a hard time staying on the floor when he comes back. Hope the kid figures it out."

"&gt; Which non-playoff teams have players that the 76ers would accept for Simmons that would be reasonable in the eyes of the 76ers?  Harrison Barnes, D'Angelo Russell, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"
&gt; OG is a 1a/b with Siakam  I have no idea why people can't process that Fred Vanvleet is out best player. It's not even very close lol
Fred vanvleet is the most overrated player in the nba
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"

That's Finals MVP Runner Up Fred VanVleet to you.  Put a little respect on the old man's name!
Dude should be getting Fred VanVleet money.
The Raptors should have 5 players drafted and 6 players first team.  Fred Vanvleet didn't get drafted but signed with the raps after the draft

"""Raptors: Khem Birch +40, Fred VanVleet +30""  This doesnt surprise me. Khem has been great defensively and he and FVV work so well together on offense its being called ""Khemistry"" in game threads lol"
"Oh no. That was because he was sent to the G League and then he came back this April and played considerably better for the last few weeks of last season.  He just needed to log into more minutes. Developmental Staff was hired just a few months ago and those kinds of things normally need a year or so to start seeing the benefit, developmental coaches can't work that fast.  One of the best signings we got was the main Raptors developmental coach. The Raptors beat writers were super bummed out. He does a great job in addressing offensive talent if it exists(so great for Kuminga especially). He was solely responsible for raising several prominent Raptor players like  Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby and Fred VanVleet"
"Unrelated fun stat I just noticed during the game:  Tyler Herro averages more FGA per game than LaMelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, Karl-Anthony Towns, Fred VanVleet, Jordan Clarkson, Joel Embiid, and James Harden."

Fred Vanvleet - Aubrey
"The play before his injury, he got into it with Fred VanVleet. They were talking shit and had to be pulled back from each other, if I remember correctly. I can't speak for everyone, but in the packed sports bar I was watching, everyone started gloating/yelling shit when Durant when he went down, turned the ball over and gave us a free basket right after the interaction. It was like a ""you got into it with our guy, and now look at you"" kind of a vibe. It only became clear after a few minutes that he had seriously re-injured himself, and everyone mostly seemed to reign it in at that point.  I'm not excusing it (especially the way it came across in the arena). But I do think that context was almost immediately forgotten."

It's Fred VanVleet. FVV. Not FVF.
Very few people actually want to talk basketball in these spaces.  &amp;#x200B;  In another thread here showing a video of a younger Fred Vanvleet playing with Jordan Poole someone mentioned how good he utilizes triple threat and my heart warmed over.

He is actually very good. But I'm concerned that we're gonna lose him in free agency.   I think he's actually a great 3rd/3.5 option. Similar to how Fred VanVleet on the raptors championship squad.

"You're a Raptors fan, Fred VanVleet does this basically every other game. Why is this shocking to you?"
"It's the organization's and coaches' job to turn a group of players into a solid team, but they never managed to do so. If undrafted Fred VanVleet turns into that kind of player most of the credit goes to the organization who saw something in him and the coaching stuff that built a solid and efficient system in which he (and all the others) could thrive."

Nick Nurse is going to kill Fred VanVleet.
"Second in the league in deflections (behind only Fred VanVleet) and leading the league in total steals so far, so he's hacking successfully."
Did you think Fred Vanvleet peaked at 22 years old too?
"The second story is of the time that a different teammate, Fred VanVleet, was really struggling at the rim. Fred just couldn't hit anything at all, and one day Svi came up to him and said he wanted to show Fred something in the video room. FVV was thrilled -- Svi is renowned for his basketball eye. For a long time, the Raptors thought Mykhailiuk would make a great scout after he retired (that plan is probably scuttled since Svi will clear $300 million in basketball after he plays out this contract). Anyway, VanVleet followed Svi into the room and got ready to receive some advice. On the television, cued up, was the behind the back crossover and drunk Svi hit against Indiana in his sixth big league exhibition. They watched it together. And then watched it again.   ""Do more of that,"" Svi said."

Hubie Brown voted for Fred VanVleet again.
"I'm a Raps fan but when I hear Siakam and VanVleet have already eclipsed someone like Chris Bosh's entire tenure. I admittedly get super fucking upset.   Like put Kyle or Fred or Siakam on a team with absolutely no defense like the 2007 team and see if they win 47 games. Especially after losing Vince for nothing. It's ridiculous, but that's what happens when your fanbase basically doubles after winning a title.  Like, they even just make up nonsense like ""they left the first chance they got"". So yeah, I never knew when you enter the NBA you're forced into a 7 year contract with your original club?"
