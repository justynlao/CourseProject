O'neale is better on bigger guys than quicker guys and we have derrick favors. Not saying that's enough but it's not horrible
"Surely we can find something between kaminsky and ayton in the multiple years since drafting luka...  Shit, the rookie you guys nabbed this season prolly isn't far off once he's seasoned a bit.  I'm talking like ed davis/derrick favors level dudes.  Just limited vets to cross t's and dot i's."
"I know youre probably exaggerating, but Derrick Favors and Ayton have both done well defending Jokic recently"
"when rudy is sitting on the bench and derrick favors is guarding jokic is that “other players helping him”?  again, it was a bad night for gobert, but he did not play during all of jokic’s minutes."
"This is really funny considering you are obviously just a box score watcher since most of his points were against Derrick Favors, and now that it has gotten kinda close so we will be seeing him in the fourth. What an awful post, just say he is doing great and leave it at that. Gobert isn’t only getting paid for his defense anyways."
"You're being a wet blanket, but it's the truth. I dealt with the same thing with tunnel-vision homer Rox fans last year during the post-Capela trade Russ hype. I had my doubts and I was right when I predicted we'd still lose in 5 to the Lakers in spite of that awesome game 1 win. That regular season run we had was fun, but it wasn't predictive.  This current iteration of the Jazz reminds me of a less elite version of the front runner Bucks of the past 2 years for me in terms of still not believing it until I see it in the playoffs. The Bucks were a 70+ win pace team last year with comparable analytics to the 73 win W's and 72 win Bulls but it meant nothing. Fwiw I still hold those same doubts for them and Coach Bud.  Plus people forget this is essentially the same exact Jazz team(besides Derrick Favors) that tanked down to the 6 seed to avoid the Rox last year, only to lose a 3-1 lead in the 1st rd. My extremely low benchmark for believing in the Jazz is seeing them win a 2nd game in the 2nd round which they haven't done since 2008. I'm not even asking for a WCF appearance, let alone a Finals appearance, which the current hype would have you believe is possible.   I love David Locke and his podcast network, but he had me drinking the screen-assist flavored kool aid the past 3 years, but I'm not buying the ""Nobody's talking about us so let's prove the Jazz doubters wrong!"" thing this year."
"Actually... we got Derrick favors for one of these reasons, so gobert can defend the paint while Derrick is on AD, favors is actually pretty good defensively so going to be interesting to see how it turns out"
"Pick up Ramon Sessions and pry Derrick Favors from our cold, dead hands and you got a stew going!  Os-Man Favors Gay Love SexLand Sessions"

"This game tonight shows why you're wrong about 100% of what you think this team is tho.   They really are a completely different team this year.   The emergence of Clarkson, reemergence of Conley, and addition of Derrick Favors have completely changed who they are &amp; what they can do.  They are capable of putting 5 players on the court for 48 mins a night that are capable of beating you. Oh, &amp; all of them are fresh, well-rested, and well-coached."
"Man, I love Derrick Favors so much"
I've said this before and I'll say it again.. I love Derrick Favors
"They are playing rocket ball with better shooters - 7 shooters who are career 40%+ shooters.  Also, Derrick Favors makes sure there is 48 minutes of rim protection.  They only way to beat them is out-athlete them for 48 minutes and hope they have a bad shooting night."
Reminder that Derrick Favors still isn't 30 yet.
"The Tobias Harris Corollary: Good to very good player, but you always feel like you can upgrade from him. See also: Victor Oladipo (high end), Derrick Favors (low end)"
"It was a tough situation for us. We got Derrick Favors, Jaxyson Hayes, Zion, and just signed a supposed floor spacing 4 in Melli. He just didn't have room. Tbh im kind of upset over Zylan Cheetam (I think I spelled it right)."
"Second season and he’s already made plenty of mistakes like cutting Christian Wood before last season despite Derrick Favors being our only good Big man on the team. The other options were Jahlil Okafor, rookie Jaxson Hayes and Niko Melli 💀"
"Also, TIL Derrick Favors is listed at only 6'8""."
"I was really high on them entering last year, until Mike Conley got hurt twice and Bogdanovic missed the entire year.  Now that they're both back, they've been balling.  Plus Derrick Favors??   Nuts."
This motherfucker just finished through Derrick Sexual Favors.  And he knocked him down too.
"I mean he just fucking bodied Derrick Favors like it was nothing, wtf is this kid"
If anyone in this thread doesn't love Derrick Favors I would be very shocked.
"I watched this, thought to myself “who was that guard that just bounced off Zion,” then looked and saw it was fucking Derrick Favors lol"
Derrick Favors Revenge Game
"Something I was thinking about was how everyone says the league is downsizing, but it's not centers who are dying out, regardless of what Shaq might say. It's the traditional power forward. If you're big enough, you just slide over to center (Derrick Favors), or play both positions (Anthony Davis). If you're not big enough to play center, then you need to expand your game, most notably with a three-point shot, which Blake, Paul Millsap, and Kevin Love have done in recent years.  Griffin had the ball-handling and passing skills, but he's needed to add the 3 to make up for the changing league, and his body deteriorating.   There aren't a lot of Horace Grant, Brian Grant, Charles Oakley type PFs in today's league. Most PFs are big wings, and/or have a more perimeter-oriented skill set."
"I am impressed by the group of young talent the Grizz have who fit the classic Grizz mold. Tillman reminds me of a bit smaller Derrick Favors, he's gonna be solid like he was at MSU. If JJJ becomes a star they will be deadly I tell ya"
"From what I've noticed:   Coby White up to 6-5 from 6-4.  Wendell Carter up to 6-10 from 6-9.  BI up to 6-8 from 6-7.  DMitch down to 6-0 from 6-1.  De'Andre Hunter is now 6-8,   Dwight is back to 6-10,   Ben Simmons up to 6-11.   Shai gained an inch (6-6).    Melo down to 6-7.   Derrick Favors down to 6-8 from 6-9.  Surprisingly, Shaq Harrison stayed at 6-7. Mentioning bc he said that he was 6-4 when asked last year.  Kuzma now at 6-10 from 6-8.  Again, possible that I missed people, I only checked the ones that sounded different to me."
Man I love Derrick Favors
" &gt;Turner and a free agent for 11 mill does not have even half of the impact of Gobert, the Jazz’s best player.    11M gets you Avery Bradley and Dwight Howard or Derrick Favors or Serge Ibaka 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
"He is hard to find a comp for me. He has really good defense and is up there with Bam and some others as best perimeter defending big man which is crazy because he is 7'0"". His rebounding is great. I have yet to find any centers that are as bad as he is was at getting to the line. His ball handling isn't good as well. I think he is going to be like that Enes Kanter and Derrick Favors hybrid that Jazz fans wished they had early in both of their careers before they had Rudy Gobert. Enes Kanter on offense and Favors on defense."
"He only played 8 games and got waived to make room for Derrick Favors... I kind of agree that he should have gotten more of a chance but an 8-game stretch is hardly making the leap. Especially when those 8 games came after getting waived by the Bucks. He didn't even suit up for the Pelicans in summer league.   I honestly think it was more an issue of fit and opportunity with the Pistons. He got minutes, he got the ball in his hands on the offensive end, and he showed a level of discipline that he never had before. The man got waived 5 times ffs (Pistons x2, Bucks, Pelicans and, I shit you not, the Fujian Sturgeons) and was 'team optioned' by the Hornets after spending most of that season in the D League.  Maybe he was making the leap during that run with the Pels and they just completely missed it. But you're saying it like that made him a proven commodity. He barely got any interest after they waived him. I doubt it was masterful scouting by the Pistons (they were probably just desperate for a warm body, as usual) but he went there and proved himself for most of a full season. Also, if you check his stats over the course of that year with the Pistons, it shows a very clear upward trajectory... ""Swinging right out of the gates"", nope. Check his game-by-game stats for that year. He was pretty inconsistent in the first half of the season and by February he was balling out every game. Most credit goes to the man himself but Pistons deserve some credit for that."
We were 12-70 and ended up with Derrick favors instead of Wall

KAT is a 6-15th ranked player with unlimited room for improvement on defense. Just needs to study Derrick Favors tape imo.
Joe Ingles and Derrick Favors
Joe Ingles and Derrick Favors
"I absolutely know I’m biased but there are a lot of reasons to be. Mike Conley is starting off the season playing the way he ended last season (aka really good). Donovan has started this season a little slow but if the playoffs are anything to go off of we have nothing to worry about with him. Bogdanovic (our second top scorer last season) is back after missing the bubble with a wrist surgery. We have a 2 time DPOY with Rudy Gobert, plus Derrick Favors returning fills a massive hole in our roster when Rudy is off the court. Plus we have Jordan Clarkson who has been a walking bucket, and Joe Ingles who pairs really well at the PnR with Favors. Really just have a really solid team and our roster basically only improved since last season."
"I’m simply acknowledging that the Jazz chose to lock themselves into this team, which isn’t a bad option. They are very good and I really enjoy watching them.   But they had other options that don’t involve paying a 33 year old center $46 million. They have Derrick Favors who is one of the best backup 5s in the league.   You can get a lot for Rudy from the right team - and honestly I don’t think Donovan is super siked to have him as a costar."

"2016-2017 Jazz go from good 5 seed to Elite Team  Pg - George Hill, Raul Neto, Exum, Shelvin Mack  SG - Joe Johnson, Alec Burks, Rodney Hood  SF - Gordon Hayward, Joe Ingles  PF - Derrick Favors, Trey Lyles  C - Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw  &amp;#x200B;  You'd have an elite scoring option in Joe Johnson, DPOY Gobert, Hayward before injury, Leader in 3Pt% Joe Ingles, and an elite slasher in George Hill.

I swear Derrick favors played with Carlos boozer. And he’s only like 28
"Mostly against Derrick Favors, and once or twice when the 76ers pulled Rudy out of the paint IIRC"
"I can rant all day about Paul Millsap. Super underappreciated career. Utah Jazz traded for Derrick Favors and drafted Enes Kanter to replace Al Jefferson and him because they had more potential but Paul ended up being the better player. Also, a very interesting old article that was named after Millsap [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080122202848/http://ballhype.com/story/the_paul_millsap_doctrine/) that argues that per 36 stats are actually very accurate and if anything, underestimate how much a bench player would produce if they played more minutes (with enough sample size of course)."
Derrick Favors would still be tougher than the Tony Bradley we would throw at Jokic last year too
I will not hear any Derrick Favors slander
Derrick Favors back in Utah is an underrated redemption arc
Is Derrick Favors worse at defense now compared to what he used to be or is Rudy Gobert just that good that he makes everyone look bad at defense who backs him up? I remember thinking Favors having all defensive potential but just never developed to have it.
Derrick Favors is JAG
Derrick Favors still isn't 30. I feel like he's played for 15 years.
derrick favors is selling
Derrick Favors is one of those players who seems like he’s older than what he is. If you asked me I’d say he was like 35 or so. The man is only 29

lol Grayson Allen's antics would get his ass laid out in the 90s  someone like Derrick Favors would be much better back then. Also players like Greg Monroe would be starting instead of out of the league.
Mitchell was one of only two Jazz players with at least 50% fg.   The other was Derrick Favors who only attempted (and made) 1 shot.  And they still won.

I thought you were talking about Derrick Favors and it took me so long to figure out what you meant
"Clippers would have Kawhi/Luka so probably the two best players on the floor.  Utah would then have Donovan and Gobert  Clippers would have Paul George  Name a single Clipper who is better than the following list of players  Ja Morant  Mike Conley  Bojan Bogdanovic  Joe Ingles  Jeremy Clarkson  Derrick Favors  Royce O'Neale  Maybe the Clippers 4th best player is as good as Royce, but Utah would be WAAAAAAAY deeper.  It's not bias, its just Utah has a deeper squad and we'd be adding Ja in the mix in this hypothetical."
"&gt;he’s worth way more than the MLE  I mean, not really?  Did Trez have an above average season, yes.  But 1) fans discount defense in favor of offensive stats and 2) fans also don't seem realize the contracts of certain role players.     This year, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka, and Tristan Thompson all made MLE.  They don't necessarily put up the numbers that Trez does, but they are all likely more reliable players for a playoff team as they aren't huge defensive sieves.  The year before that, Seth Curry, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all signed for roughly the full MLE, while other good players like Bullock, JaMychal Green, Richauln Holmes, and Rodney Hood all signed for less.     Literally every single one of those guys has an argument for being a more useful player for a contending team looking for playoff success than Trez.  Trez absolutely has a market, but it's smaller given his playstyle (which is good for the regular season, but difficult to play in the playoffs).    Saying that he deserve ""way more than MLE"" is silly, because substantially more useful players get MLE all the time."
I was so upset when they went 12-70 only to get Derrick Favors instead of John Wall.
Should have been between Thibs and Snyder. Monty gets way too much credit for their success. He’s a fantastic coach but they added CP3 and Jae Crowder. Snyder literally just got Derrick Favors back and is the best team in the league by a mile.
"Starting 5: John Stockton, Vince Carter, Royce O'Neale, David Lee, Tim Duncan  Bench: Jamal Crawford, Derrick Favors, Vince Carter, Rasheed Wallace  Coach: Quin Snyder"
Derrick Favors played for the New Jersey Nets.
1. Royce O'Neale 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Mike Conley 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Derrick Favors
"Yeah people don’t realize it but Atlanta/GA is one of the hotbeds for basketball talent. Dwight, Jaylen Brown, Lou Will, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick Favors, KCP, WCJ, Jae Crowder all currently in the league...then you have Shareef Abdur-Rahim World B Free, Horace Grant, Josh Smith, just to name a few historically"
"While the series hasnt gone they way I wanted , facts are, Of the 192 minutes played in the first four games, the Jazz have been trailing on 14 minutes all together. The Grizzlies are a good team that plays really hard. I can’t say often enough, they always struggle against 2 quick and prolifically scoring guards. Brooks has elevated his game to a whole other level.   Aside from game one, in which i feel they came out with a mission to win. I bet they felt dismissed by the Jazz sitting Mitchell because of the perception they could win without him against them.   I’m a fairly objective fan. I knew for instance that the Jazz were done last year before the playoffs started, because the missing link Bojan was out, and their backup C was not named Derrick Favors.  It’s just so different now; have you watched them?!  I’ve watched all but 2 or 3 of the Jazz games this year. This is the best Jazz team I’ve ever seen and I’ve been a fan since 1987. They are the only team that was top 5 In offense (5) AND defense (3). They were #1 in the league for a reason, just as the Suns were #2 in. The. League.  I forgot to mention that the Jazz have the smallest media market and fan share in the league, so does it make a lot of sense for the league to hype them up?"
That’s Nets Legend Derrick Favors
I can’t believe this man Derrick favors is only 29
What kinda of hairdo is tht Derrick Favors?
PG: Patrick Beverly  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Domantas Sabonis  C:  Derrick Favors or Andre Drummond
I wake up every morning and punch a hole in my wall because the Nets traded Derrick Favors to the Jazz midway through his rookie year
He did make a few mistakes. He called Royce O'Neale Derrick Favors once. And I counted 3 times that he said a player had the wrong number of fouls. Like he would say it was their first foul when it was their 2nd kind of thing. Not that bad compared to other commentators though.
They’ll go out and get someone like Derrick Favors
"Derrick ""sexual"" Favors"
"To expand on this, the Suns signed him using the non-taxpayer mid-level exception, which is the main way for over-the-cap playoff teams to add role players in free agency.  The Suns used theirs on Crowder, Portland used theirs on Derrick Jones Jr, we split ours across JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2-ish), Utah used theirs on Derrick Favors, Boston on Tristan Thompson, Toronto split theirs across Aron Baynes (7) and Alex Len (2-ish) and Washington used some of theirs to give Robin Lopez 7.2  Just looking at what other teams did with their MLE last year, I would bet Crowder had other bidders and Phoenix had to go the 3 years to bring him in."
"Alright, so [here are the matchup stats after last night.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629630/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;Matchup=Offense&amp;sort=MATCHUP_FG_PCT&amp;dir=1)  Most of Ja's shots have been defended by Mike Conley, against whom Ja's shooting 63%. He's also shooting 63% against Derrick Favors.  Against Gobert? 38%.  Granted, there's some nuance there, since that data only looks at primary defenders, and much of the time Gobert is a help defender in the paint. Still - this is another data point indicating Gobert is, in fact, negatively impacting Ja."
"I swear Derrick Favors was originally listed at 6'10"", then got bumped down to 6'8"" a few years ago, and then was recently lifted back up 6'9"" for some reason."
"Other than the obvious windfalls associated with Mitchell returning, I expect Derrick Favors not to drop as far as he did in the paint when Morant is on the floor."
I'll take Derrick Favors over Taj any day.
"Yeah, Wiseman is going to be good, and Derrick Favors (a p good player!) is waaaaay below even his most pessimistic floor. Sorry, but your future as an NBA scout is kaput."
" Derrick Favors is a best-case scenario, don't hate on DF like that.  Also - not sure what you saw that looked promising from Bagley, he's ass too, but can do more on offense than Wiseman can."
Not many NBA players actually worry about Derrick Favors chasing them down from behind.
derrick favors is playing championship level basketball right now but nobody will notice bc its dirty work and defense
"Last year they had Jrue Holiday, 2019-20 JJ Redick, and Derrick Favors  This year they had Eric Bledsoe, 2020-21 JJ Redick, and Steven Adams"
I would like to see Derrick Favors' number retired in Utah.
Derrick Favors
I love Derrick Favors
"Those Sixers teams were some of the worst teams to ever step on an NBA court. They were shameless about the process. The 12 win nets team was pretty bad , all they got out that was Derrick favors."
*favor. As in Derrick Favors.
This is a REALLY good Derrick Favors stint. Prob the only Jazz positive so far
"The traditional power forward, who did the dirty work and shot 15-18 ft jumpers with a little bit of post offense. Think Horace Grant, Dale Davis, PJ Brown, Tyrone Hill, etc. In today's league, either you are big enough that you're just a center now (Derrick Favors), you've expanded to the three point line (Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap), or both (Serge Ibaka). Or like AD, you just slide between the two positions."
"I think that was definitely part of it.   Point is teams with scoring bigs w/range caused problems for Utah defensively. Not because Gobert can't defend them, but bcz it forces Gobert to focus of a single defender-- rather than being able to roam the paint &amp; keep everyone else from getting buckets at the rim.   That is why they needed a 2nd quality defensive big to be able to A) back-up Rudy effectively &amp; B) play mins next to him to defend quality opposing 5's when necessary (like Jokic &amp; AD)  But reports were that it was primarily Utah's problems w/Davis &amp; the Lakers last year, that led to Utah targeting Favors.  [Source](https://lakersdaily.com/report-utah-jazz-decided-to-target-derrick-favors-after-having-problems-with-anthony-davis/)"
Mike Conley is playing like Mike Conley again. Mitchell has raised his game yet again. Bojan is back from injury. Gobert is playing the best season of his career. Joe Ingles is leading the league in TS%. Jordan Clarkson has become an automatic bucket off the bench. Gobert’s backup minutes are going to Derrick Favors instead of Tony Bradley.  Plus we were already the best 3pt shooting team in the league last year and simply decided to turn that up to 11.  We’re really just firing on all cylinders at every position this season... except our 3rd stringers. They’ve turned many 30 points blowouts into 15 point wins this season.
"Remember that game. Derrick Favors was huge that day, he slowed Giannis down a little, while Gobert looked like Isaiah Thomas out there lol, Lopez denied him a bunch of times. Then Mitchell caught fire in the second half"
12-70 Nets losing out on John Wall and getting Derrick Favors with 3rd pick too
Derrick Favors
"&gt; The adjustment black players have to face in Utah is real. The stories of racism are constant black players face in that area.   Yet the first paragraphs of the article:    &gt;“I never had any problems. The people always treated me nice,” said former Jazz forward-center Thurl Bailey, an African-American who converted to Mormonism.  &gt;“There are a lot of great people out there. They try to help you as much as they can,” said Jazz forward-center Derrick Favors. “Everybody speaks to you. Everybody smiles. Everybody says hello. I’ve never witnessed any kind of [racism] out there. It’s a great place.”  These are two long tenured members of the Utah Jazz, one from the 80s and 90s, and another from this last decade."
"1. Rudy 2. Mitchell 3. Conley 4. Clarkson 5. Bojan Bogdanovich 6. Joe Ingles 7. Royce O'Neale 8. **Derrick Favors** 9. **Georges ""Minivan"" Niang**"
The Jazz president of basketball ops said that they signed Derrick Favors specifically because they knew they couldn’t match the size of the Lakers. They would probably have some Wasatch Front minutes if they play the Lakers
"Man, I had high hopes for Terrence Williams. Glad Derrick Favors has carved out a decent career tho.  Back then, Kerry Kittles was my lowkey fave net, aside from Kidd of course. Followed by Lucius Harris. Fun times. I swear Aaron Williams was serviceable 😂"
Frankly Derrick has had some health problems and overall hasn’t looked the same. He could push favors for the backup spot
Trent Forrest played more minutes than Derrick Favors.
You forgot Derrick Favors
"7 games is a VERY small sample size—especially 7 games where Rudy struggled and had to play extra minutes because the back up Center (Tony Bradley) was a massive liability against Denver.  Anyway, If you read what I wrote I literally said the only folks Gobert struggles against are MVP caliber players—like Jokic.  I also acknowledged Mitchell’s defense, but it’s incredibly inconsistent, and he doesnt switch up well, which is why Royce almost always guards an opposing team’s best player.  I agree, actually, that Offense is more important than defense, but Mitchell alone does not impact the team’s offense the same way that Gobert impacts the team’s defense.  Without Mitchell, the team as it now stands gets a BIT worse offensively, but they have other good scorers who will make up many of Mitchell’s points (and if they had the 200mil they’re paying mitchell, they could almost certainly buy the rest of those points).  Without Gobert, the team literally falls apart.  They have a 30 point swing in their defensive rating when Gobert is off the court, and that’s with one of the best back-up centers in the league in Derrick Favors.  And unlike Mitchell, if they lost Gobert, they wouldn’t be able to find another center that does what he does.  There literally isn’t one."
"Yeah cuz Gobert is very good, but you entire team is like 40% 3 point shooters and you have an elite wing defender in Royce O’Neale and 3 reliable PnR ball handlers with Ingles, Mitchell, Conley plus an elite microwave scorer in Clarkson. Also one of the best backup bigs in the league with Derrick Favors."
"It's not cherry picking. I'm literally using all the numbers when they are matched up with Gobert. If you say they abuse him, in what world does it not make sense to use the numbers when they are matched up with him? I'm using the correct numbers.   I'm sorry, but if Embiid cooks Derrick Favors when Gobert is on the bench...that is not Gobert's fault.   I also stand by what I said. Treating basketball like a 1v1 game is incredibly stupid. You have to be a complete idiot if you think 1v1 is all that happens on defense. My point is that even if you believe that is the case, you're still an idiot because this argument that he's being abused by all these players 1v1 is wrong.  Literally all you have to do is read. I said this at the start. There is seriously no point in trying to discuss something with someone who refuses to read lol. And lets not forget that all the analysis you've brought up is box score lol. Have a good one bro."
Almost as laughable as the -23 from derrick favors in 15.5 minutes
"Rudy Gobert dominated this game, but Derrick Favors spent every minute he was on the floor committing treason."
Derrick Favors is -16 in the game and it shows
"The only real bad picks were Flynn over Curry/Derozan, Wes Johnson, and Derrick Williams. With Derrick Williams there was concern pre-draft he didn't have a proper position in the NBA (which turned out to be true). With Wes Johnson, there were similar concerns about position and his lack of an off the dribble game (which he never ended up developing). And Jonny Flynn was genuinely talented, but hip surgery sapped his athleticism and ruined his career. Plus the Wolves already had Rubio, so they should've gone with Derozan to fill a positional need or Curry to provide shooting to Rubio's passing.  I know it's a favorite game of NBA fans to hate on the Timberwolves (and they do deserve criticism), but your post overstates the extent to which they've missed out in drafts and favors heavily from hindsight."
"Man, Gobert contributes to winning as well. He's literally the most impactful defender in the NBA, if you look at his defensive on/off over the years it's insane. And he wasn't replaced by subpar defenders, Derrick Favors was a good defender and they still couldn't make up for the Gobert's defensive impact."
"I've been thinking about this recently. Centers are as good as they've been in a while---it's the traditional 4 that is dying out. You either have to be 1.big enough to play center, so you either slide over to C full time (Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka), switch between the two positions (AD), or if you're not big enough you have to expand out to the three-point line Blake, Millsap, Kevin Love (although he expanded his range earlier than the others). A lot of guys playing PF now would previously be combo forwards/tweeners, or are just big wings. Siakam was a combo forward, now he's just a normal PF. Additionally, there is a de-emphasis on back to the basket play, so it's easier to get away with this.  It looked so bizarre seeing Portland throw out a Nurk/Whiteside/Melo frontcourt last season---felt like a 90's throwback."
"BI has been pretty bad all career, not sure where this defense reputation comes from aside from his length. Bledsoe has phoned it in since the the start of the season barring one Milwaukee game, and Adams has fallen off a cliff after his injury even though he still contributes (regressed to how Derrick Favors was for us last year). I love Hart, but he cannot help how terrible the team’s entire defense is.  With a slightly below average defense, we’d be a playoff lock for sure which makes it so frustrating."
I’m sure Derrick Favors is going to lockdown Anthony Davis and Jokic.
"What did the Utah front office did before coming into this season that drastically improved their team? They brought Derrick Favors back...  That’s not much move at all, it was the same roster with continuity growing from the year before and everyone being healthy and grooving now.   Nets on the other hand basically retool half the farm to get Harden, with injury to Spencer Dinwiddie, addition of Jeff Green prior to start of the season, new addition of Blake, new coaching staff of Nash and Mr Pringles... it’s so much more impressive what they accomplished in short amount of time to put them in title contending position"
Stacey Augmon-Plastic Man.  A few I came up with are Mario Superintendent Chalmers and Derrick Sexual Favors.
But if you have the top 3 pick you have the option to draft those guys. Having a higher pick gives your more option. I don't think it's stupid to want pick #3 instead of pick #15 even if Kawhi was better than Derrick favors in that particular draft
"No? Traditional power forwards who can’t defend the perimeter slide up to the 5 nowadays. See: LaMarcus Aldridge, Porzingis, Derrick Favors, Ibaka, etc  Teams can’t afford to have more than one slow-footed big on the court, especially in the playoffs. Teams with good guards target them on switches and run them off the floor"
"There are around 200k people in SLC, with 2.6% black population, so there are approximately 5200 black people. Assume half men, so 2600 black men.   33.4% of the city’s population is 25 to 44, now we have 1736 people. I’m going to cut this group in half, as Clarkson is 29 and could pass as any age from 25 to 35, so we are now at 868.   Clarkson being 6’4” puts him in the upper 0.8% of height for the population ages 25-34, knocking this group down to 7 people.   Looking at the Jazz roster from last year, the following players fit the profile of black, 25-35, and 6’4” and above  -	Jarrell Brantley -	Jordan Clarkson -	Derrick Favors -	Rudy Gobert -	Shaq Harrison -	Georges Niang -	Miye Oni  Summary: if you see a very tall black man who looks like he can legally rent a car, there is a 100% chance he plays for the Jazz."
"I'm not saying Simmons is a great player, I'm saying that he's way better than derrick favors"
"I am saying the only reason Simons has any recognition is because the market he plays in. If he played in Utah, no one would know about him and he would be sitting behind Rudy Gobert. I believe this is Derrick Favors 11th or 12th year in the league. I don’t think Simmons will have that length of career unless something changes. In fact, the 76ers don’t have to do anything and could effectively end his career for 3 years. Which in essence would end his career."
"by what measure? I don't really get why we are comparing them, actually... I was just imagining a weird gym where well-paid players whose teams don't want them to play all get together and work out. Since we're talking about it, though, I don't really get it. Derrick Favors has never won anything or been recognized with any award whatsoever. Do you just mean money?"
"Bro, if simons never played another game, you telling me he is going to have a better career that Favors? Lost your mind. If he played in Sacramento, would he have been anything. The only reason he had a max and people know who he is because he is in philly. Otherwise he would be sitting behind Steven Adams or Derrick favors somewhere."
Derrick Favors at the end of the day will have a better career than Simmons.
instagrams from NBA purgatory! Kevin Love and Derrick Favors will come join the shootaround any minute now
"That is not how anything works. Matchups are also a thing. Jokic happens to struggle with Derrick Favors more than any other player, different players have different strengths and weaknesses. That is not a good way to show that someone was generally better than another"
"In my opinion, there are really only two feasible routes for the John Wall saga to take. Both end with him being bought out and signing where he wants.   Route 1: The Rockets trade him to OKC for Derrick Favors and salary filler. The Rockets have to attach multiple picks (not their own, though. One pick from the Bucks and one from the Nets) to get it done, but Tilman Fertitta saves $30 million, and it becomes possible for the Rockets to open cap space for themselves next offseason, either to sign free agents or use the space to take on contracts in exchange for draft picks (the Sam Presti special, which Presti won't be able to do anymore because the Thunder will be capped out). The Thunder buy out Wall and he signs wherever he wants.  Route 2: The Rockets try to make it seem like there are several teams competing to trade for Wall, which nobody buys. They continue this charade until the trade deadline, at which point they finally accept nobody will trade for him and they buy him out. Wall signs wherever he wants.  I don't see any future where a team actually trades for John Wall in order to play him. His contract is way, WAY too big for a good team to be willing to part with everything they would have to in order to acquire him."
"My favorite ""we have to pay him"" guys, who demonstrate with one exception that no, you don't have to pay them:  * Andris Biedrins, GSW, 2008 * Gordon Hayward, UTA, 2014 (Was a terrible contract at the time. Look at the footage and it confirms the numbers. Don't let Utahns gaslight you because he suddenly learned how to dribble and pull up a year and a half later. Also, Derrick Favors that same offseason.) * Allen Crabbe, POR, 2016, Cap explosion GOAT * Otto Porter, Jr., WAS, 2017, Cap explosion active GOAT, he's making $30+M, get that bag, ToPo * Derrick Coleman, PHI, 1996 * Paul George after this contract is up * Special mention: Evan Turner managed to get paid twice"
"Judging based on previous performance pretty clearly Derrick White and Jakob Poeltl. Dejounte did close the gap this last season however.   Dejounte graded out much better in ESPN’s RPM and bballlindex’s LEBRON than he had in previous seasons which aligns with how much better he played last year and improved as a facilitator and mid range scorer. He was on almost dead equal footing with Derrick in both of those measures last season, but Derrick struggled to stay healthy and Dejounte wasn’t rated as highly by 538’s RAPTOR. RAPTOR favors Derrick and Jakob pretty clearly. For clarity’s sake I prefer LEBRON to RAPTOR, and prefer watching basketball to any statistic no matter how they’re derived. I wouldn’t trust a measure that deviates far from what I see from watching games, but in this case these 3 measures all align closely with my opinion of them. A 2 season sample size would be preferred for all 3 players. After all Derrick was hurt a lot this year making his sample size even smaller, but including 2019-20 will also obviously hurt Murray’s statistical argument as he was demonstrably worse that season than 20-21 where he can seriously rest his laurels on maybe being their best player.  These quantifiable measures are much quicker to digest and easier to stand on than anything else given most people probably don’t see 95% of Spurs minutes. An amount which is probably necessitated given all the oversights we make without re-watching film of previous games where you catch a lot of things you miss watching live. In any case, Dejounte is the only player (based on previous performance) who could be argued in as impactful as Derrick and Jakob.  Going forward? Given many players young age/inexperience in the NBA, or someone like Dejounte’s continued improvement every season, it’s anyone’s guess who’ll be the best this year. I would take the safest bet with Derrick for now.  It really wouldn’t surprise me if any 1 of 6 guys was their best player after this season but only using past performance you’d probably pick Derrick and give Jakob and Dejounte serious consideration. Their past performance obviously doesn’t restrain them from becoming the Spurs best player this season but I wouldn’t go so far to make big predicted growth until we see some signs of it."
"We know where this is headed, right? The Rockets trade Wall and two picks to the Thunder for Derrick Favors, the Thunder buy out Wall, he signs a cheap deal with a contender and looks better than expected while doing it. Meanwhile, we here later that the Rockets gave up multiple picks because Fertitta wrecked their leverage when he forced Rafael Stone to trade Wall to the Thunder because they were the only team in the league capable of taking on the contract without sending back equal money, thus letting Fertitta save about $35 million."
"I think it wasn't that bad. We got really unlucky with Reddick, who couldn't hit a three for his life with us. Bledsoe was just bad 80% of the time and that also couldn't have been expected. Nothing like Jrue. No grit. The Adams trade gets misrepresented in the media and in this sub, because people forgot that the year before we had Derrick Favors playing center, who had a great nickname, but just isn't an NBA center. Adams was clearly an upgrade and I think it was also an attempt to give some faces to the team. He surely is no superstar, but I think he is underrated by this sub now. Also that ""superbad contract"" we gave him secured us JV and we didn't pay one cent of the contract we gave him. So yeah, it could have worked out better, but it really isn't as bad as some want it to be."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"&gt;or just completely shit the bed like he did vs Houston a couple of years back  Lmao, it was his sophomore year and he was the only actual scoring threat as a significant underdog to the Rockets.   It was Mitch, Ricky Rubio, Derrick Favors, Jae Crowder, Rudy Gobert, Royce O'Neale, and Joe Ingles as the guys that played significant minutes."
"I agree the finals mvp is a big deal for his legacy. The better playoff record probably has to come with the caveat that Pierce’s supporting cast was better than carmelos.  At the end of the day Carmelo wasn’t in the same tier of star as a lebron or Kobe who could will a crappy team above its potential, and he didn’t do his legacy any favors by refusing to play for the Derrick rose bulls. But it’s interesting  to see how the perception of him has changed, he was considered to be better then pierce when they were both playing."
"I'd say another top 40ish player and then a bunch of good, competent role players who can make open shots and not embarrass themselves on D.  Jamal Murray  Reggie Bullock  Dillon Brooks  Lebron  Derrick Favors"
"When AD demanded the trade and it seemed like it was going to happen before the deadline, it was tough to watch the Pelicans. I decided I was just going to wait until the trade was made and then start watching again. Then the trade deadline passed and AD was still on the team. Those games were tough to watch. We were starting like 3 guys who aren't in the league anymore at some points. I was able to go to a game toward the end of the season against the Rockets, and AD looked very good for his NBA-forced 21 minutes. Then Christian Wood put up like 30-10. The Pelicans lost by 30. And the highlight of the game was when the stands gave Kenrich Williams a standing ovation for stealing the ball from James Harden at halfcourt.  The team has been pretty fun to watch since then fortunately. Although the next season, Zion and Derrick Favors got hurt and the Pels went on like a 16 game losing streak which was pretty dark too. That season got better though."
"I mean the D-Will trade wasn’t that bad. You only gave up Devin Harris (a contract-playing, no-impact journeyman) and Derrick Favors, who plays one tier above a bust. You also gave up 2 first-rounders, but that’s expected anytime you’re acquiring a superstar player in his prime.   To me, the Nets have done much dumber, crippling moves, which include putting faith/money into Yi Jianlian/Travis Outlaw, trading half the franchise for 49 year old KG/Pierce, and so on…  At least the Nets are dope now"
Derrick “Sexual” Favors
Really hate seeing Derrick Favors here. Can't say I disagree though.
I think 2010 would be fun  PG: John Wall  SG: Paul George  SF: Gordon Hayward  PF: Derrick Favors  C: DeMarcus Cousins
"I think a heavily protected first that’s likely to be in the late 20s isn’t crazy unfair. Maybe OKC sends a second round pick back or maybe even package a useful player like Derrick Favors who makes a million less, which is worth like 4m in tax money, and would be an infinitely better back-up big.   Alternatively, the Nets could give up the the seconds they have from Washington, Memphis, and Golen State in 24 and 25. The Nets’ own seconds are just completely worthless is the problem."
"Dion Waiters, Derrick Williams, Derrick Favors, Jabari Parker,"
Derrick Favors duh   /s
Watch him do the same with Derrick Favors
"They did suck, but having watched those teams, they weren't just bad, they were maddeningly bad.  We had Byron Scott who had been regarded as a pretty good coach.  He coached the Nets to the Finals in the early 2000's, coached CP3 on the Hornets to some really good years, was on the Cavs when Lebron was in Miami, and then came back to LA to lead an aging Kobe and Pau with random pieces.  He was the Tank Commander for a reason, his schemes and rotations made little sense for a coach who wasn't some newbie like Luke Walton was.  For someone who had success, it is more likely he sucked on purpose rather than on accident given the disparity in effort, though of course there's no way to prove that.  However, we won 27 games during those years bottoming out at 17, we didn't just suck, we historically sucked.  Its hard to say that even with bad players, we couldn't have swung a trade or gotten a free agent to make us at least competitive.    And Kobe being on the team proves my point.  He was our one star for years, it would have been disrespectful to not try to at least let him end his career with some dignity instead of 17 win shit team.  We gave him $50m for essentially sitting out, just because people still cared about him.  It would have taken almost no effort to pair him up with some more vets and tried to do something (like Jim Buss tried to do with Deng and Mozgov), but instead that was the last gasp of a guy being forced out of his team.  We barely tried because we didn't want to.  And another thing that proves my point: the Lakers' salary during the tank years.  You can say Byron sucked and our players sucked, but you cannot say our Front Office kept trying to put together a winning product.  [In 2012-2013](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/los_angeles_lakers/2012-2013/), we had the highest salary in the league at $100m.  When we started tanking the next year, we dropped only to #4 in the league but shaved off $25m.  The next year we dropped to #9 in the league, and the following year in 2015-2016 we dropped to #19.  This is not the salary of a team who's trying.  The next 3 years we were #19, #21, and #27 in league salary.  Why didn't we sign more Mozgov's and Deng's if we wanted to win?  There are plenty of vets we could throw a big contract to if we really wanted to go for it every year.  We could have at least maintained a top #10 ranking in salary if we wanted to compete, the Lakers' name plus the money would have gotten free agents to join, right?    The salary, more than anything, should be proof we didn't try.  We could give anyone money, who would turn down a fat check from the Lakers?  At the time Carmelo was bouncing around the league and Kobe was gone, we could have said to him ""Hey, here's $25m, come start for the Lakers and be the face of the franchise for a few years"".  Other than Melo, there were plenty of guys past their prime or guys good enough to make a team competitive that we could have thrown money at during the lean years.  Guys like Horford, Whiteside, Dion Waiters, Pau, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward, Millsap, JJ Redick, Gallinari, Taj Gibson, Olynyk, Rudy Gay, Aaron Gordon, Zach Lavine, Derrick Favors, DeAndre Jordan, etc.  I'm sure not all of them would have come, and some of them were never going to leave their team, but if the Lakers came calling with a blank check, I've no doubt we could have gotten a few of those guys as our starters.  Other people who derisively talk about the Lakers brand would have to admit that in this case, it would support the argument that the Lakers didn't get them because they didn't try, not because they couldn't, which is evidence enough for me that we were taking on purpose and not on accident.  And yes, thank you for this discussion, its rare people can disagree without insults.  Kinda nice! 😁"
"In the last few years off the top of my head the Jazz have resigned Conley and Clarkson, they got Bogey, they brought in Joe Johnson, Derrick Favors came back. None of those guys had to go or stay in Utah but they did, so ""jack shit"" might be a bit off. You're right about Minnesota though."
"You're down the bottom, but you probably have the most realistic expectation. If you get an All-Star in the top 5 picks you're hitting above average, but a good starter seems about right.  Since 2010, All-Stars: Wall, Boogie, Kyrie, AD, Beal, Dipo, Embiid, KAT, Russell, Zinger, Simmons, Ingram, Brown, Tatum, Trae, Luka, Zion  Not All-Stars: Turner, Favors, Wes Johnson, Derrick Williams, Kanter, Tristan, Valanciunas, MKG, Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Bennett, Otto, Cody Zeller, Len, Wiggins, Jabari, Gordon, Exum, Okafor, Hezonja, Bender, Dunn, Fultz, Lonzo, Josh Jackson, Fox, Ayton, Bagley, JJJ, Ja, RJ, Hunter, Garland"
"You could say that, yeah. But then again, our only other option at that time was Derrick Favors who is a worse perimeter defender than Gobert. Basically if a team decided to go Stretch 5 against us, we were fucked. That’s probably why our FO was so eager to sign Rudy Gay, who will probably just be playing at the 4 but could also be used as a “break in case of emergency” Center if teams go Stretch 5 on us."
This reminds me of fucked up nicknames I give players. Derrick “Sexual” Favors.
Dante Exum  Derrick Favors  Larry Sanders
"I bet Jrue Holiday would be a good fit, imagine the alley oops from someone like Lonzo, probably try to get a rim protector like Derrick Favors too, maybe a shooter Reddick maybe(would prefer someone younger tho)"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."

"i consider him a pf but even so, derrick favors doesn't exactly strike fear into opposing teams does he? there's a reason no contending teams wanted him on their roster"
Man didn't know derrick favors wasn't a big but sure.
"And yet the Warriors still gave up two seconds to get him from David Griffin. Okay, so he used the two seconds on Derrick Favors. The point stands!"
That big trade? Juancho Hernangomez for Derrick Favors.

I thinking we’re just letting him sit until we takes way less than he’s probably worth. And then gets moved the second we can move him. I’m still wondering why we haven’t offered Culver and a 2nd to OKC for Derrick Favors
If you're going to be forced to play a center that sucks you might as well do it on a vet min instead of the 8M you all paid Derrick Favors.
Derrick Favors
One derrick favors will fit nicely into the exception. Thanks for the second rounder when it happens!
Derrick Favors. Presti is asking how many picks the Nets got?
I don’t know if I’d call keeping your team together and adding Gay/Whiteside/Paschall “killing it”. None of those guys are impact players.      Also Hassan Whiteside is older than the aging Derrick Favors.
"Sure, but no other teams are willing take on 74 million dollars of dead money.   No one on OKC's roster next year will be making over 10 million dollars and Shai's extension won't hit the books until the 2022-23 season.   The largest number on the books besides Kemba for 2021-22 is Derrick Favors at 9.7 million. Everyone else is on rookie deals."
"Only with the roster spot. Kemba's money is still on the books, but OKC could absolutely take another bad contract. Outside of Kemba, the highest paid player is Derrick Favors at less than $10 million"
How about for Derrick Favors?
"I think every single season, I've thought of Derrick Favors as being 3-5 years older than he is."
"Hes 53rd if you don’t put a minimum minutes requirement.  If you limit it to players who played more than 500 minutes this past season he’s 14th.    The players ahead of him include Isaiah Hartenstein, Javale, Goga, Dwight, Okongwu, Boogie, Mo Wagner, Wiseman, Cauley-Stein, Damian Jones, Grant Williams, Derrick Favors, and Dwight Powell."
I still don't understand why the Jazz got rid of Derrick Favors. He was a great backup center.  Favors + future 1st rounder FOR future 2nd rounder + cash considerations  Must have really needed that Cash.  Edit: Didn't realize  Favors was making 10mil/year and the probably wanted to avoid luxury tax. Makes some sense at least.
Why did the team bring back Derrick Favors just to give up a first round pick to dump him after a season? Luxury tax concerns and/or he was bad?
"Bulls could use an extra rotation defensive 5, and yall have Derrick favors. I see that as a solid option for chciago, maybe with a second or late first moving too."
No wonder they moved derrick favors. They didn't want a gay-favors pairing
It’s actually not a specific year - it’s at least 2024 if not later but they didn’t say you get X year’s pick.   I mean I think it’s pretty clear that if you have to move a salary you give a pick. They also just signed Rudy gay after re-signing Mike Conley. Imo it was a move to make the team better not quite Derrick favors is trash and they need to move on. Favors would have put them more in the luxury tax which they don’t want to pay.
I'm sure Derrick Favors is available for a pick.
Derrick Favors could be a pretty nice fit imo
Derrick Favors or Khem Birch should be decent
Griffin really swindled two seconds out of the Warriors by picking this guy. (Ignore his gamble on Derrick Favors with those two picks)
"Excuse me, we have Derrick ""Al Horford"" Favors to sit the whole season"
How tf did ok finesse a first rounder and Derrick Favors outta the Jazz while only getting a second lol
"If LeBron James, Derrick Favors, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love and Ramon Sessions were on the team, it would be, ""Gay Love Sessions Favors Lebron."""
"If LeBron James, Derrick Favors, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love and Ramon Sessions were on the team, it would be, ""LeBron Favors Gay Love Sessions."""
Anyone remember when ESPN said Derrick Favors was the 18th best player in the nba?
Is Derrick Favors and his contract that bad that they needed to give up a first round pick just to get rid of him? I'd imagine teams would want a very solid center
We actually have Derrick Favors who is an elite offensive rebounder but go off.  Roberson also didn’t have a handle and couldn’t get create his own shot. Most of the OKC guys have capabilities to run the P&amp;R as well as break their guy off the dribble. This type of team building has never been seen in any form of competitive basketball.  And also 2 first round picks &gt; 16 pick everytime.
Isn't Derrick Favors good?
Derrick favors that overrated?
The Jazz's relationship with Derrick Favors seems... clunky.
The Derrick Favors in Utah journey is eternal.
Derrick Favors has a 7’ 4” wingspan Sengun has a 6’ 10” wingspan. Favors was a top 3 pick and elite shot blocker in college.
"The Utah Jazz have agreed to trade C Derrick Favors and a future first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder for a future second-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Jazz create some financial flexibility and Thunder grab another first-rounder."
"Anyone else see similarities between Rockets and early 2010's Jazz in terms of the bigmen situation?   Usman Garuba 4 and Sengun 5.  Derrick Favors 4 and Enes Kanter 5.  Defensive 4 and offensive bigmen 5. I know this is a superficial comparison and not a comparison in playstyles (for example, I think Sengun fits the modern NBA better and Garuba is more developed then his stats suggest). The reason I bring this up is Christian Wood. Like Paul Millsap, he didn't really fit their timeline. With the Utah Jazz, those players didn't end up being as good as hoped (along with Trey Burke and Alec Burks) so they had to reroll the dice with new young core with Mitchel and Gobert which did work but it can work this time."
"The Great:   -The Davis trade after a really ugly second half to the 18-19 season and basically dealing with NOLA vs the world   -Helping shape a development staff with Gentry to help BI and Zo blossom.   -Naji Marshall UDFA —&gt; contract extension  -The Jrue trade; did right by Jrue and secured a bag of future picks and swaps. To all those people saying they won’t mean shit in five years: LMA and Bosh were all stars five years ago.   -Maxing BI    The good:   -Offloading Solomon Hill’s contract and signing JJ Redick   -Trading second round picks for Derrick Favors at the time   -With Trajan and Swin as well, seems to hit the draft pretty well. Jax, despite recent news (let’s also not mail in the rest of his life for this shit either), Nickeil, Kira, and Naji have all shown signs of a whole bunch of promise and legit talent. Jax was fantastic the second half of last season. Pels probably make the play in if Nickeil starts over Bledsoe. Naji was a fuckin Diamond in the rough.   -Willing to not let open wounds fester and immediately identifies and fixes own mistakes; something a deadbeat VP would not do.   -trading Redick and Melli for James Johnson, Wes Iwundu and a second rounder. Redick and Melli became unplayable and we saved some money for this offseason by offing Melli.       The bad:  -Choosing Melli and Jah over C Wood. Granted there was definitely some behind the scenes stuff with Wood’s attitude, but man Wood would have killed it with Zion.   -SVG  -Way too many guards on the 2019-2020 roster.   -Not enough shooters and defense on this last seasons team.  -Not extending Josh Hart BEFORE last year (this is more TBD/me nitpicking)    The Ugly:   Being the VP of a team who’s best player’s step father is already wanting his son off the team."
"That Denver first they gave up for Adams was top-10 protected in 23,24, an 25, so it's not like it was a super valuable pick. The Adams acquisition was a consolidation of assets designed to fill a need in the wake of the departure of Derrick Favors.        The mistake in the chain of deals was using George Hill as salary instead of Bledsoe."
As opposed to noted outside shooter and screener Derrick Favors?
Joe Ingles or Derrick Favors. They both have kids and seem like really good dads.
Derrick Favors seemed like he was 28 for about 9 years
"Derrick Favors at 29 would have worked, but he just turned 30 so it's not as striking."
Derrick Favors just turned 30 a few days ago.
Derrick Favors finally turned 30.  It feels like just yesterday that he was the Jayson Tatum of the NBA.
"Derrick Favors is both the all time ""holy shit he is still that young?"" and ""Holy shit when did he get that old?"" player"
Derrick Favors
"Exacrly, everyone thought it was a headscratcher but pelicans fans still defend it. Not quite as bad, but reminds me of Lakers signing Mozgov. Pelicans could've easily gotten a Derrick Favors level player for 10mil instead of giving up picks for Adams."
"Last offseason: Derrick Favors making 9.7m  Jakob Poeltl making 8.7m  Ibaka making 9.5m  Robin Lopez making 7.3m  The only thing Olynyk has over these guys is opportunity because *someone* had to score baskets for a tanking Houston that ended up worse than Detroit or Orlando.  The market for older role-playing only Cs with middy skillsets is a lot less robust than you think.  if you want to present me a genuine counterfactual, im not above changing my opinion."
"PG- Malcolm Brogdan SG- Collin Sexton SF-Jaylen Brown PF-Jae Crowder C-Dwight Howard Bench:  Antony Edward, Derrick Favors, Malik Beasley, Wendell Carter  Overall team ga wouldn't be bad, especially if Dwight was back in prime form."
"If we’re doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We’re lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can’t think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I’m leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
Don’t forget the Derrick Favors signing and basically trading DeAndre Hunter
I don't know how anyone who watched this playoffs could say Derrick Favors looked better in defense than Rudy
"You're acting like Suns perimeter defense is some kind of elite, CP3 is not elite anymore, Booker is not a good defender, and Crowder is good  Gobert had this same problem in previous years, Derrick Favors looked way better in defense and Utah were 20+ points better when he was on the floor   Ayton is much more versatile in both offense and defense"
That was also with Derrick Favors playing power forward and killing the Jazz’s spacing
Joe Ingles + Derrick Favors + 2 future 1st round picks  Edit: I'm a Jazz fan until the Sonics win the pendant.
I'm big on Patrick Williams. I could see him turning into a better shooting Derrick Favors-type even if he doesn't become an all-star. Or maybe late career Paul Millsap. Depends which way his offensive and defensive games go.
"Once upon a time our FO had the difficult decision of choosing two big men between Enes Kanter, Rudy Gobert, and Derrick Favors."
PG- Derrick Favors  SG- Myles Turner  SF- Clint Capela  PF- Udoka Azubuike   C- Rudy Gobert
"Isn't Nigel Williams-Goss some guy they drafted with a second round pick that they fucking bought? Lmao.  Exum's value to the team was salary match in a Jordan Clarkson trade. Bust.  Also it's not 2000 anymore you don't start 2 bigs in a lineup. I don't know what the hell happened to Derrick Favors - was one of the better backup centers in the league, got traded to NOLA and sucked then came BACK to the team that traded him to be a full-time bench guy that got murdered in the playoffs."
"I just realized how old the Jazz' supporting players are.  Bogdanovic-32  O'Neale-28  Ingles-33  Derrick Favors---29, but he seems older.  Even Jordan Clarkson is 29."
"Kawhi. I seen kawhi eyes almost level to rim on the Derrick favors jump. If you ever seen kawhi cross a man up when he is really trying it pure perfection he started to do it when he came with the clippers but the way he can dribble and break down a defender with his size and footwork is beyond impressive to watch. If you watch kawhi the past two year you know what I’m talking about, that double cross pull up is perfect from him if he is moving fast and trying."
It's about as informative as saying Derrick Favors and Jordan Clarkson don't like each other.
Drummond and Derrick Favors (somehow still just 29 years old) are the two guys who always shock me with how young they still are. It feels like they should both be in their mid 30s
"Nah, if the Knicks didn’t make the trade the Nets were going to instead.   Only reason the Nets traded for D.Will was because Melo fell through before their move to Brooklyn. Once the Nets went 12-70 missed out on John Wall and got the #3 pick (Derrick Favors) they realized they needed a “Star” player for their move to Brooklyn.   Nets had to deal with the “Melo-Drama” and then the “Dwight-Mare” shortly after when Howard was forcing his way to Brooklyn only to back out at the last second because he felt bad on the team plane surrounded by everyone.    “Dwight-Mare” led to the Nets in a panic sending an unprotected 1st in a shortened season to Portland to show D.Will they were willing to invest in the roster. That led to Portland drafting Lillard w/ the Nets pick.   Worst part of the whole D.Will era is the Nets were almost free from it in back in 2012.    D.Will was hesitant to sign his 5y/$98m extension and wanted to go home and play in Dallas all while training and rehabbing using the Brooklyn facilities.   Nets lined up Goran Dragic and were ready to cut their losses and move on. Dragic was amped to be on the Nets because Drazen Petrovic was a childhood hero of his. All of a sudden D.Will is given a ultimatum of either sign or leave the facilities and the Nets continue down a dark path. Dragic signs in Phoenix and gets traded to Miami later on.   What could have been in Brooklyn landed Melo and Howard instead or even Howard to pair with D.Will because you have to remember this was still while Howard was in his insane prime before the back injury in LA."
"That's gotta be a two-way street. From my perspective, Zion seems like he wants to win more than the team does. There isn't really alignment on goals. Otherwise, it's hard to understand how they thought taking a team that didn't make the playoffs, removing Jrue Holiday/Derrick Favors and adding Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams was going to be a winning formula.  The team has more assets to use to build a better team but they seemed relatively content being a subpar team this year. Zion from his side seems pretty intent on winning. This is a guy who came back to play for Duke after a knee injury when he could have easily sat out and still been the #1 pick in the draft. Obviously he's far from a perfect player, but I'm not sure you could realistically ask more from him this past year."
"I agree with that. The EOTY award is by far the stupidest award in the NBA. It's impossible to judge the moves a GM has made in the same season. Sam Presti has set OKC up to be title contenders in a few years time, but only got 1 vote for EOTY. It's a stupid award with dumb criteria, voted for by the GMs themselves, who all have grudges with one another, and vote for their friends.  Not saying that James Jones hasn't done a great job, but the award clearly doesn't reward the best GMs in the league. How the fuck was Lindsey from Utah the 2nd best GM this season? Signing Derrick Favors and paying Rudy $205 mil gets him 2nd in the EOTY voting? So fucking dumb."
"their shooting was incredibly elite, but you need some variety because guys can get cold / lose rhythm.     Gobert anchoring the defense at the very least gives you the most simple path to contention, but you have to add more diverse options around him and have a plan for the 5 out lineup. Derrick Favors is not the answer."
"Take him out for who? Derrick Favors? Yeah real points for the grade A analysis here bud. The simple fact that you can’t comprehend here is that his assignment is being a help defender for cup, not whoever is in at the 5 position. That’s his role. The issue here is the perimeter defense that got beaten off of the dribble at every opportunity. Idk how anyone can see it otherwise."
So Derrick Favors being -25 for the series in 11 minutes per game is meaningless? Do you think anyone else would have stopped Mann at the rim if Rudy couldn't?
Now imagine paying another $10M for his backup Derrick Favors.  Utah is about to enter cap hell
I was told because his on/off numbers against 5 out were way better than Derrick favors he was still an elite player
"Derrick Favors still has a fair bit of defensive life in him, tho it is mostly also rim defense lol"
Derrick Favors was +12 in his 5 mins on the court and the Jazz never put him back in the game?
Has  Derrick Favors played in the 2nd half?
derrick favors can't usually hold down the fort
Gobert is good in the regular season where not ever team has incredible options or top tier wings to attack him from the perimeter. In the playoffs damn near every team does and he isn’t incredible because of it. Derrick Favors is very bad though so you kinda have to play Gobert nearly 40 minutes.
I’ll say two things   1. Give a coach time   2. The fit with Zion and Steven Adams or Jaxson Hayes or Derrick Favors doesn’t work
"Jk redick, Derrick favors.   I do think JJ was a high quality vet.   The AD haul brought three good players"
I was very impressed by Derrick Favors tonight.  I miss having him on our team and I'm glad he is doing well
"Not really, the ghost of Derrick Favors doesn't count"
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
want derrick favors if we could work salary out somehow?
Derrick Favors most games. Today it was JRE who’s surprisingly half decent
"Gobert is slow laterally and has been targeted in the playoffs for literally years, only one series doesn't matter  Literally every Houston player was trying to switch on him and Derrick Favors pre injury did way better than Gobert and the Jazz had an amazing defense and runs with him, then Favors came back injured and even worse than Gobert so their back up is just as bad they give up even more"

Derrick favors lmao
Derrick Favors plays for OKC?
I wouldn't be at all mad if Derrick Favors never played another minute for us.
I just love Derrick Favors
Steven Adams on a buy out? Derrick  Favors?
I love Derrick favors so much it hurts
"2nd attempt.  I fired up the trade machine and tried to find a third team that could get involved.  three way between Lakers, OKC, Kings  * Lakers give Russ, 2025 swap, 2026 1st, 2027 swap, 2023 2nd (Chi), 2023 2nd * Lakers get Buddy Hield, Derrick Favors, Kenrich Williams  Why Lakers would do this - they dump Russ's contract, get a shooter in Hield, a wing in Williams, and an extra big body in Favors  * OKC gives Derrick Favors,, Kenrich Williams * OKC gets Russ, 2025 swap, 2026 1st  Why OKC would do this - they're going to be too good to tank, Russ can help them on the court, he brings culture, and they get picks out of it.  * Kings give Hield * Kings get 2027 swap, 2023 2nd (Chi), 2023 2nd  Why Kings would do this - they get out of Hield's contract and get a swap and 2nd out of it."
that's only if both teams are over the cap.  OKC can get $45M under the cap by dumping Derrick Favors contract.
Nope. Their success last year will follow Derrick Favors.
Derrick Favors and a few seconds. We'll probably just flip him for a couple of firsts anyways
Who he play for?  1. Derrick Favors 2. E'twaun Moore 3. Denzel Valentine 4. Rodney Mcgruder 5. Aaron Holiday
"The level of ignorance and lack of historical knowledge of the youngsters here on reddit never ceases to entertain me.   The 1971-1972 Lakers team is perhaps the best NBA team ever put together of players knowing, accepting, and performing their roles.  Wilt bought into his role of being a rebounder and defender.  Although he could still score at will, that is not what was needed of him.  You see the results.   When you say he played against defenders who were much less skilled and athletic than even old man Derrick Favors, are you referring to HOF centers Cowens, Lucas, Reed, Unseld, Bellamy, Abdul-Jabbar, Lanier, Thurmond, and Hayes who he faced nearly every game?  Each one of them had more skill and athleticism in their pinky finger than Favors could ever dream of.  -SMH-   In the championship game Wilt scored 24 points and had 29 rebounds with a broken right wrist and severely injured left wrist.  If you look at pictures it appears he has casts on BOTH hands.  Finals MVP.  'nuff said...thanks for the laugh."
"In 1972 Wilt was 36 years old, he attempted fewer than 10 shots a game that year, in both the regular season and playoffs while playing against defenders who were much less skilled and athletic than even old man Derrick Favors."
"I’m not buying the takes in here at all lol, give me the Lakers. Motherfuckers really think Wilt Chamberlain is gonna be locked up by the “evolved” athlete that is... Derrick Favors?"
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
Derrick Favors is only 30.
Derrick Favors has been in the league forever and just turned 30 a few months ago.
Facundo Campazzo is older than Derrick Favors and only 5 months younger than Ricky Rubio.
Derrick favors is only 30 years old
derrick favors and malcom brogdon are only about a year difference even though they are 6 draft classes apart
"Bro, Drummond's ""rivals"" now are the likes of Hassan Whiteside, Robin Lopez and Derrick Favors."
"Most salary dump trades, like the Derrick Favors and a 1st for a 2nd and cash trade"
"I thought the core of Tre Burke, Alec Burks, Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors, and Enes Lantern was gonna win us a chip....  Oops"
"We were also missing our starting point guard for all but the last game when he clearly wasn't himself. Yes he should have made some adjustments, he should have told our wings to rotate when gobert helped against drives. But subbing out gobert would essentially be waving the white flag. Who would he put in who was actually on our team. Derrick Favors is just a worse gobert at this point. I mean maybe running a five out offence with ersan might have worked but very much doubt it would. Running anyone else at the 5 would just be stupid."
"Ah, yes, Derrick Favors.  He would have solved the problem."
"Dragic, Wall, Thaddeus Young, Kemba, Gary Harris, Satoransky and Derrick Favors are probably the best candidates for the buyout market this year, guys that are pretty good veterans for a contender, but hard to trade with their contracts"
TIL Derrick Favors isn't a true big man
Lol OKC would literally have to send no assets back. I believe they have several trade exceptions they can use and potentially use Derrick favors. If they wanted to do it they could do it without giving the lakers anything of value.
Derrick Favors
The thunder can trade derrick favors for him. They got extra picks.
derrick favors is still in the nba  mkg is not
Derrick Favors is easily the most unathletic starter
"unfortunately this is a common theme with Kupchak. I get the feeling he is not proactive at all in the trade market, and he let's easy buy-low opportunities pass him by.  OKC got a 1st to take Derrick Favors into cap space, while we did the same with Plumlee for a 2nd, a worse player who's a worse fit, with a worse pick coming back. We should've been all over that Favors trade, just like CLE was for Allen."
Okay Presti needs Reaves to get rid of  Westbrook. Presti will give first round pick Mike Muscala and Derrick Favors. Deal?
Poku is old news. Build around Derrick Favors.
Why does Giddey only run P&amp;R with Derrick Favors? Can he do that sumore with the starters coach?
"Everyone else played kind of inconsistent, I love Kenrich but this year might be the time to ship him, idk how we gonna rehab Derrick Favors, he's playing like Melo did when he was here. We generated open shots and just couldn't hit them. What I love the most about this team is that they all will have one good defense play for the night"
Bro it’s absolutely criminal that the Nets finished 12-70 and ended up with the 3rd pick and taking Derrick Favors.
Bol Bol and filler for Derrick Favors who says no
Bro it’s absolutely criminal that the Nets finished 12-70 and ended up with the 3rd pick and taking Derrick Favors.
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
"Player heights up to very recently were very skewed. I met Alec Burks, Dante Exum, and Derrick Favors after a game once. I’m a legit 6,6” without shoes and was easily taller than Dante and Alec. Dante is taller than Alec too even though they were listed as the same height. Derrick favors was prob 6’8”"
i mean i hope this game goes to the spurs. Moral wins is better than actual wins at this point but damn if jakob poetl is the difference maker against a team starting darius bazley and derrick favors lol
"Imagine having such low standards that a no allstar, no allnba, barely top 100 player is not considered a bust at #1 after 8 years.  You can be a serviceable NBA and still be a bust. See Derrick Favors, Marvin Williams and many others."

ADisney got shut down by Derrick Favors lmao.
Remember when you were overpaying Derrick Favors? Utah gave him the shaft trade-wise
Derrick Favors used to vague tweet before every trade deadline and said it was a lot of fun to mess with people.
I feel like derrick favors has been playing for my whole life and he's only barely 30
"Not a PF but if they just need a backup big to take up minutes and start in case of injury, Derrick Favors seems like a solid fit for them. Could salary match with DJJ and still keep Coby White to use in a potential separate trade or just to play him"
or if Derrick Favors could still jump
"Hey, Derrick Favors got a 3."
i will absolutely fucking not accept any derrick favors slander
Derrick Favors had a +/- of +37 last year. (Gobert’s was +728.)  This year Whiteside’s is +49 (and Gobert’s is +19).  Definitely happy to be getting positive minutes from our backup center.
Derrick “not doing himself any” Favors
Derrick favors incoming
"Right. They're useful. But when you have limited resources (salary cap/salary slots/assets in general) and you have title aspirations, you cannot use your MLE on a guy who becomes unplayable when the games matter. You have to get the most bang for your buck or you will lose in the playoffs.   Utah, last season, fucked themselves by signing Derrick Favors with their only real FA asset (a full MLE) instead of signing someone who actually solved their biggest weakness (somebody who can guard big wings).  Jae Crowder signed for the same money as Favors.   The players you sign if you want to win 45 games and maybe get out of the first round are different than the role players you sign if you're trying to win a trophy at the end of the season."
"Zion. OKC would just turn Ja into Russ 2: Electric Boogaloo. Besides, we could use a big. Zion might be heavy and injured a bit too often, but would you rather play Zion or Derrick Favors?"
"Gorgui Dieng, Thad Young, Daniel Theis, Khem Birch, Ed Davis, Derrick Favors. It’s tough to get rebounding defenders of starter quality cause you know they are starters for a reason."
"The bulls? Honestly think they’re close and just need some reliable vets off the bench next to caruso. Like a Terrance Ross, thadeus young, Jeff green, patty mills, Alec burks, Derrick favors, etc type vets for a 9-10 deep playoff squad"
Derrick Favors
Derrick Favors
What a bum. They should just trade him for Derrick Favors so they can have a real center out there
"Trade idea:   Mavericks get:   * Christian Wood  Thunder get:   * John Wall  * 2027 Mavericks 1st (top 5 protected)  * 2023 Rockets 1st (lotto protected each year until unprotected 2027)  * 2022, 2024 Mavericks 2nds   Rockets get:   * Kristaps Porzingis  * Darius Bazley  * Gabriel Deck  * Derrick Favors  It works in the trade machine financially. Mavericks burn a pick to turn KP into Christian Wood. Rockets move Wood and a heavily protected pick to get rid of John Wall, and they get back a fair return. Thunder take on Wall's contract to get a few picks. Who says no?"
I think he's not worth his contract but he's still playable so they could get something for him.   The Thunder need a big man and are hella under the cap. I feel like they would take Porzingis and a lotto-protected 1st for like Darius Bazley or Derrick Favors. Mavs would do it purely to get $32m/y off the books for the next three years
"He shot 8/18 and had 20 points while being guarded by Gobert. If you watched the game you would have seen he got lots of points against derrick favors, try again."
"On the benches are Kyle Anderson, Enes Kanter, Seth Curry, Derrick Favors, Patty Mills, and Nerlens Noel."
He reminds me so much of Derrick Favors.
"Six minutes left in the game and down 16, and Utah had Trent Forrest and Derrick Favors in. Seemed like lineups were the biggest issue with the Jazz tonight. Starting crew didn't play much together. Forrest looks afraid to shoot. Good defense by the Jazz on Steph despite his points, but Draymond played great and everyone else took the threes instead."
Yeah this is always the case for the guards with high rebounds numbers.  Just collecting a ton of uncontested rebounds but people love seeing that big number in the box line!  Derrick Favors and Westbrook average the same amount of contested boards a game.  Favors averages 5.5 rebounds.  Westbrook averages 11.6.  Alex Len averages the the same amount of contested boards as Luka.  Per game he averages half the rebounds Luka does.
"I think a lot of people are overly critical of the Adams move. We gave up deep bench players and two 2nd round picks for him. The way I see it, we gave up peanuts for a significant and much needed improvement to Derrick Favors at the center position. We had great spacing/3pt shooting last season with a non-shooting 5, so I don't think it's fair to make Adams part of the problem this year. I'm happy with that move, personally."
Smh Derrick Favors has a name
"1. conley, SS - good defender, will get on base, has never struck out in his entire career. great table setter  2. mitchell, CF - good speed and range, can hit for power as well  3. gobert, C - Big man with a huge bat, insane range defensively  4. bojan bogdanovic, DH - swings for the fences every time  5. joe ingles, LF - if bojan didnt bat them in joey vegemite will  6. jordan clarkson, RF - also swings for the fences every time  7. Georges Niang, 1B - hes in the league for his hitting, but also surprisingly decent defender for his position   8. royce oneale, 2B - good individual defender, not a huge offensive threat but he can make plays  9. derrick favors, 3b - quietly does the dirty work like a professional"
"Man is having a top 5 individual defensive season of ALL TIME and your goofy ass is sitting here pretending he's not the best player on a team with the (tied for, but still) best record in the NBA.   Stats back this up too - absurd on/off numbers (despite having a very competent Derrick Favors as a backup), record with and without Rudy vs Donovan, it's pretty clear that Rudy has been the engine that makes the Jazz go since '15-'16.   Regardless of his individual offensive limitations his skills have translated to consistent, winning basketball and have allowed the Jazz to build a consistent, winning system around him."

i've been saying this since the Derrick Favors signing its not a preseason gripe
After 2019 was when yall invested in offense and its paid off amazingly. IIRC the biggest lost (at the time) was like Derrick Favors.  Getting Clarkson and giving him the green light to score off the bench and not worry about defence was a great addition too.
"Rudy Gobert, Mike Conley and Derrick Favors are AVAILABLE. Ersan Ilyasova is OUT."
"The only players I've really ever seen give Jokic a difficult time are Bam and Derrick Favors, but even then, Jokic usually still gets his."
"They are CLEARLY a worse team than 1-7 in the west. Clearly. You wouldn't take them over any of those teams. They are within \~5 games of every team 8-13, that's MEM, GSW, SAS, NOP, SAC, OKC. Like I said, they prob should have won a couple more games, but they are a fringe playoff team and they belong in that group.      Everything points to that. The best player on the team is 20 years old and hasn't played a full season. The are one of the youngest teams in the league. They are a piss poor 3pt shooting team. They are a piss poor defensive team. They've lost rotation pieces to injury. Last year they were a fringe playoff team, and since then they lost Jrue Holiday, Derrick Favors, and JJ Redick when he was still good."
Hell even a Derrick Favors would've worked
"For sure, I think a lot of people saw CJ’s breakout coming, just didn’t expect it to be so rapid, following a relatively pedestrian second year.    But yeah, the potential was always there, he was a lottery pick for a reason. While the Duke upset gets a lot of attention, he was a beast from the jump. In 2010, he was named to the Sporting News NCAA All-Freshman Second Team. The first team featured John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Derrick Favors, Derrick Williams, and Xavier Henry. On the second team, CJ was joined by Kawhi Leonard, Hassan Whiteside, Alec Burks, and Elias Harris. Making that list was clearly a strong predictor of future success."
"Mike Conley has sat one game of almost every back-to-back ever since he injured his hamstring earlier this year. The only time he didn't was last week. He played yesterday, so no playing today.  Derrick Favors didn't play yesterday either so I don't think he is healthy. The only real surprise here is Gobert."
Stockton’s at #6 right behind Derrick favors and Miye Oni
"Derrick Favors didn’t want to be with us anymore and neither did we really want him. He liked multiple tweets before the season ended about going back to Utah next season. He had back issues that slowed him down a lot during the season and got us exposed on defense and offense. While I’ll admit Adams really is having a down year and his lack of scoring aggressiveness when he’s at the rim or gets an OReb is bad, the contract extension is only for 2 years and decreases each year so the contract becomes more tradable to win-now playoff pushes. Plus the contract ends when Zion will be due his max extension and we should be theoretically ready to be make a splash trade with our treasure chest to truly compete."
"Yeh but that isn't that hard to get. You didn't need to trade for the guy, and pay him a bunch of money. Heck they were doing very well with Derrick Favors."
&gt; Derrick Favors gathers more contested rebounds a game than Russ.  He is a center who boxes out other centers so it would make more sense for him to grab more contested rebounds.
"All triple doubles are nowadays is guards gobbling up uncontested rebounds and base 10 convincing people that it matters a bunch.  The assists are really impressive, the individual rebounds mean jack shit.    Derrick Favors gathers more contested rebounds a game than Russ.  He averages [5.5 rebounds a game, compared to Westbrook's 10.8](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&amp;dir=1).  THAT is how much bullshit individual rebounding numbers are. Which player do you think impacts rebounding more when he's on the floor? Russ almost averages as many rebounds as Enes Kanter lmao    Same deal with Luka to a less extent.  He's 32nd in rebounding.  He's 96th in contested rebounds.   Individual rebound numbers are not remotely close to representative of who actually makes a difference in their teams rebounding."
"It's still definitely shifted in perspective.    For example, at the start of Paul Millsap's career, he was considered a scrappy tweener.  He was a good enough rebounder, but people didn't expect much from him due to his size.    Utah traded Deron Williams for Derrick Favors because Favors had the ""ideal power forward"" frame, who we developed for years to replace Paul Millsap.  Meanwhile, in 2021, Paul Millsap is now considered to be the ideal Power Forward, and Derrick Favors has become an outdated concept for a power forward and was made into a center."
"Y'all make the weirdest most specific stats ever. ""Derrick Favors breaks the record for most consecutive 7-point 3-rebound games when only playing as a 3rd quarter sub on Tuesdays between Christmas and the all-star break"" type of shit"
"I don't think AD presents the same problem as the other two.  Jokic and Embiid are massive, and they can neutralize Gobert a little bit by going into his chest and knocking him off balance. AD is more of a 4/5 and doesn't have as much of a power game.  In the past when Derrick Favors was younger and healthier the Jazz used to have success by putting Favors on Jokic and Gobert on Millsap so Gobert could play help side."
BAM dodging derrick favors
Still more mobile than Derrick Favors.
"\- They have arguably the best pure defensive player in the league. Rudy just completely shuts down the paint. He's the DPOY  \- Mitchell improved his playmaking this year. He's now a threat to set up teammates as well as scoring  \- Mike Conley is back to his old self - great playmaking, shooting, defense and leadership - and not hobbled by last year's injury  \- Jordan Clarkson is the 6MOTY, he's an absolute flamethrower and 2nd units just have no answer for him  \- Knockdown shooters like Bojan and Ingles who play meaningful minutes  \- Great depth pieces like Royce O'Neal and Derrick Favors  They're just a complete team top to bottom with few, if any, weaknesses. The biggest one is the lack of a clear-cut superstar, which has hurt great regular season teams before in the playoffs. It remains to be seen how it will affect them, and if Mitchell can take that next step and become that superstar level player."
Mentioning last years playoffs without mentioning the small but very important roster changes made this season by the Jazz.  Without Tony Bradley and us having an actual Defensive backup center for Rudy in Derrick Favors we don't hemorrhage points during bench minutes which was a significant factor in the jazz losing during those playoff games.
"Mike Conley isn't washed, Spida took another step, Gobert has friends, Boggy and Jingles are good at basketball.     Team cohesion goes a long way in a season with half an off season and no practice. Their *big FA signing* was Derrick Favors who's played there like 9 years"
"2018: Serge Ibaka is 6'10"", Derrick Favors is 6'10""  2020: Ibaka is 7'0"", Favors is 6'8""  Makes perfect sense."
Derrick Favors
"Yea its just odd. Look at how Dennis treated players like Joe Johnson, Dante Exum, and Derrick Favors where he chose to trust/reward them or trade them in ways that didn't really benefit the Jazz because he respected them as people. He's always had a reputation of being respectful and high character. He's also actively provided a platform through the Jazz organization for players to engage in activism for what they were passionate about. He's trusted by high character people like Quin Snyder and Donovan Mitchell. This is why its so confusing.    Obviously, if its true, no fucking way should he stay in charge. Our players don't deserve that shit."
"ingles is only 33 MKG 27  Derrick Favors is somehow 29  everybody in that 30-32 range klay, PG, Dame, Jrue, etc cant believe they're getting old"
" &gt;	Two defensive centers - Gobert and Ayton.    Really understating how much better Gobert is than Ayton. Guys like mikal bridges and Cameron Payne are inexperienced, while Joe Ingles, Bojan, Derrick Favors, Jordan Clarkson all have experience."
Derrick favors was our starting power forward like a year ago...
"Derrick Favors.   Two years ago they didn't have the offensive weapons (notably Clarkson and Conley) to keep up with a high octane offense like Houston had with Harden in his prime. Last year their defense suffered without Favors; Gobert couldn't run the defense all on his own.  With both of them, their defense is solid inside and flexible out, and with the multiple offensive weapons they won't die when Donovan has an off game.  Though the stars are the same, this year's team is very different from 2018-19 and 2019-20."
"PG; John Stockton  SG: Joe Ingles   SF: Andrei Kirilenko   PF: Karl Malone   C: Derrick Favors   Honorable mentions: Mitchell, Gobert, and Okur"
"Melo's people of Utah! If Derrick Favors (who must have been part of the NJ package) was on the table I wonder what Utah was offering. In the off-season before the Jazz imploded Utah wouldn't presumably wanted to put Deron Williams and Melo on the floor together so Utah could maybe offer something including some combo of AK47 (expiring), Al Jefferson (not a great contract), or Paul Millsap (bargain contract). Nuggets probably had their eye on Millsap but were able to get a better deal out of NY.   If they Denver bitten though like if NY pulled out thinking they had him in free agency I wonder if the Jazz don't implode the same way after a loss against a Bulls team with half their old players. Could Utah keep Melo and Deron together in this hypothetical?"

"Someone I think the mavs shouldve got was Derrick Favors. A good rim protector and post defender, solid rebounder, great pick and roll big whos sneaky athletic as a lob threat despite his stature.   Was very suprised the mavs didn't try to get him either last year or this year."
"I mean partially you're right - Mitchell is having a career year from 3p range (in large part due to the fact that he's taking more catch and shoot 3s), but the real standouts for this team are   1. Our guys are more aggressively taking their shots - in the past, Bogey, O'Neale, and *especially* Ingles would inexplicably pass up wide-open 3pt shots to keep the blender running. Now that we're shooting more 3s and the chucking spirit of the Filipino Deity of Love and Vengeance has started to possess our roster, they're really letting them fly from distance.  2. Defense. Royce and Rudy are awesome, but our bench minutes with Bradley on the floor last year were *atrocious* for an NBA team on the defensive end, and now we've upgraded to Derrick Favors, arguably a top-15 center and one of the best rim-protecting bigs in basketball. Niang has also stepped up in a big way, and Conley has really gotten back into form as a premier defensive guard (or as good as you can be while only standing at about 6' tall).  3. Speaking of, Conley has had a wonderful bounceback season so far. Efficiency is way up from last year, his floater is falling, the three ball is dropping, he's running the offense, and he's clicking with Gobert. All that plus Quin's rotations have moved Mitchell to the second unit where Conley was playing a lot of his minutes last year, and now Conley is finally in a great position to succeed.  There are lots of schematic adjustments and improvements in places other than shooting where Utah has improved this year that account for the more aggressive, higher tempo team we're seeing compared to 19-20. It's not just more 3s on a better rate, although that definitely matters."

* Clarkson takes 3s instead of 2s. MF also plays defense now.  * Mitchell is a better passer and has better vision. Improved on Defense.  * Mike Conley understands the system. Better on Defense this season.  * Bojan is healthy.   * Joe Ingles is resurgent.   * Derrick Favors is the backup C instead of Tony Bradley (when Utah would hemorrhage points on the bench).  * Royce O'Neale decided he wanted to be a rebounding god and added elite rebounding to his top shelf 3&amp;D skillset.

"&gt;to make up for that lack of physical toughness from a value perspective  I agree with you questioning MVP level value due to missed games, but hard disagree with blaming it on lack of physical toughness. The dude is HUGE, and this is a very physically stressful game. Derrick Favors has back problems and he's 20 pounds lighter than Embiid; I'll fight you if you say Derrick Favors is lacking physical toughness."
If you squint really hard you can see Pokémon evolution from Mike Conley to Royce O’Neal to Derrick Favors
Derrick Favors has a huge head
"You might be right if voting was positionless, but which winning Western frontcourt players would you have over Zion or Ingram?   Derrick Favors? Ingles? Ayton? Rudy Gay? Draymond?  Remember second to last isn't as bad as it seems. 8th through 14th are tightly packed."
"The biggest move for the Jazz this offseason was bringing back Derrick Favors. We just were not good defensively last year when Gobert was off the floor, and if I recall correctly our rebounding was atrocious as well. Favors is a starting caliber center on a lot of teams in the league &amp; and he has only spent 1 season away from Utah his whole career - so he has damn good chemistry with this core. Getting him back on this team has made a much more positive impact than most non Jazz fans may realize."
"&gt;The Jazz might sweep every award besides MVP, but since their roster is largely the same as it was at the end of last season, I don't think they get this one.  My plug for the Jazz is they kept Clarkson, shored up extensions for Mitchell and Gobert, and brought back Derrick Favors which is a majorly underrated aspect to their success."
Derrick Favors has been a huge part of our defense
"I can tell you one big difference between the Jazz and those Hawks, Bucks, Raps teams, and its coaching (also notice the common theme of Budd teams overachieving in the regular season and crapping the bed in the playoffs lol). Quin Snyder is a terrific coach and one of the best game planners in the NBA. He's put together terrific gameplans in their recent playoff runs, and the losses have usually been a personnel issue more than anything.   A few other common things I've seen:  &gt; The Jazz don't have a superstar and teams that are legit have at least one superstar.  That could be true, but it might not. We don't really know, but Donovan Mitchell easily could be a top 10 player at some point in his career and it's entirely possible we just don't know it yet. It's true that some teams have won without a current consensus top 10 player, most notably the 2014 Spurs -- incidentally who opposing players and coaches keep comparing this team to, as well as the 2004 pistons -- also comped due to the defensive grit and anchor comparison of Wallace to Gobert. That all said, Mitchell averaged something like 35.5 points (historically one of the best series ever btw) in his last playoff series and lost barely in a 7 game series against a team that went to the WCF.   &gt; This Jazz team has never made it out of the second round, what makes this year different?  Better bench play (Derrick Favors return was an underrated AF move that shored up Utah's biggest weakness -- Utah hemorrhaged points when Rudy sat, and now they don't), Mike Conley playing like his Memphis self, and Healthy Bojan (missed last playoffs against the Nuggets). They were a rimmed three away from going to the second round against the Clippers last year, and that was playing a UDFA rookie as the back up center and no Bojan."

"Derrick Favors, and Royce Oneal maintain Goberts abrasive defensive edge too. Also if they're open they can score. Just quality guys throughout the roster. Really well built."
Derrick Favors for Daddy of the year.
"Underrated:  * Royce O’Neal * Derrick Favors * Jamychal Green * Cam Payne * Justin Holiday * Thad Young * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate   Overrated:  * Marc Gasol * Lou Williams (maybe less so now) * Carmelo Anthony * Robert Covington * JJ Redick  * Matisse Thybulle * Donte DiVincenzo  * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate that just signed a big contract  It’s like the other guy says, good or large teams that have a lot of fans and a lot of attention on them will generally have their role players overrated, bad teams and small market teams will generally have their role players go under the radar."
Derrick Favors
Bojan Bogdanovic and Derrick Favors are nothing to you? Stop. Your casual is showing.
"I still don't get what the pels were thinking giving assets for Steven Adams when guys like Jakob Poeltl, Derrick Favors, Christian Wood, and other centers were signing for cheaper than the extension they gave Adams in free agency"
"Jazz got Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Derrick Favors. If only they had rubio still"
Derrick Favors
"The Nuggets destroyed the Jazz bench. They staggered their starters to play specifically against the weak Jazz bench. That is where their advantage came from. Jazz starters killed it all playoff series long.  This year hapless Tony Bradley has been replaced by Derrick Favors and Joe Ingles is pushed to the bench because we have Bojan back (who was our second leading scorer last year and will probably end up there this year too.)  Last year the Jazz bench was a -8 points per game on average. This year the bench minutes are a positive. The starters are ridiculous.   Are you just going to ignore that a major cog of the Jazz offense was missing in the playoffs last year? I mean no excuses, you still gotta win, but yeah, the offensive rating will definitely be affected. I guarantee that if Paul George misses the upcoming games against the Jazz you will factor that into the pot if the Jazz sweep.  In any case, it would be a good series, even though i think you are vastly overrating the Clippers Pick and roll defense. I guess they could entirely neutralize one of the best pick and roll combos in the league. They haven't shown an aptitude for doing that either this or last season, though."
r/suns would kill me for this but with the way he plays hed have a similar trajectory with Derrick Favors.  ofc he has a much higher floor and ceiling but im talking about trajectory. scour the archives of the 2011 draft and see the tapes and articles of him in his first 4 years in the league and youd get what im implying.  the vert tests in the combine are nothing without killer mindset and energy
"definitely not trolling  gobert has his 3rd DPOY locked up  and hes going to be the best defender in the NBA for more than just this year  the jazz are completely dependent on rudy. when he goes out, derrick favors try as he might, is just not rudy gobert  its pretty clear when you watch jazz games, teams dont usually contest gobert because it never works  and when they do contest gobert, lmao, alright then, maybe you get a cool highlight 1/20 times"
"This. This is just the pieces we thought would fit together last year actually starting to fit. Plus we made some much needed bench changes (Jordan Clarkson and Derrick Favors mostly).  If you had asked me last year what Utah needed in order to become a contender I'd have said, ""Conley needs to figure out our system and our bench needs serious repair"". Well Conley's got it figured out now (best plus minus in the league even) and we have one of the strongest benches in the league.  My boys are looking good, but it's only surprising to people who haven't been following the Jazz (which is fine, I don't follow your teams closely either :))"
Nets better trade DJ. He would do better on a team like the Suns where he’d come off the bench and catch some lobs. The Nets need a defensive big like Nerlens Noel or Derrick Favors.
